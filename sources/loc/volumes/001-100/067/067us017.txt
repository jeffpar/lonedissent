SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

THE UNITED STATES vs. ANDRES CASTILLERO.
ANDRES CASTiLLERO vs. THE UITED STATES.
1. Paredes, President of Mexico, from 15th December, 1845, until
29th July, 1846, exercised extraordinary powers, but it is
not certain that such of his acts as violated the law were
ever ratified :-Semble, That such ratification was necessary
to make his acts valid as against the government.
2. Conceding the power of the acting President of the Republic,
,to make a grant of land in California, the several documents
attesting any supposed'grant are to be examined with care,
since it thus becomes a question of construction whether it
was or w's not intended to be a grant.
3. A party asserting that he had discovered and denounced a
valuable mine in California, presented a memorial to the
Junta de Mineria, asking a loan of money and materials to
work it, and also requesting the Junta to recommend that
the government grant him as a colonist two square leagues
on his mining possession. The Junta communicated the
memorial to the Minister of Justice, with their approval of
the loan, &e.; but declined to give aniy opinion upon the
propriety of granting the land. The Minister of Justice in
the name of the President concurred vith the Junta, and
with respect to the land, ordered the proper measures to be
taken by the Minister of Relations, "with the understanding
that the government accedes to the petition." The Minister
of Relations made out and gave to the applicant a dispatch
addressed to the Governor of California reciting the pre-ious

proceedings and declaring that he did so in order that the
Governor might put the applicant in possession of the two
square leagues "in conformity with the laws and decrees on
the subject of colonization."
The dispatch was' never
delivered to the Governor :-Held, That this was not a grant
for two leagues of land nor intended to be so.
The legal effect of the dispatch of the Minister of Relations
was merely to authorize a regular application to the Governor by petition under the laws of 1824 and 1828 to be
followed by such steps as those laws require, and a grant of
land if the Governor should ascertain that it was proper to
make one.
To say that these proceedings at the City of Mexico were iii
themselves an absolute grant, either legal or equitable, of the
land claimed under them, is a manifest error which this
Court cannot be expected to sanction.
The case of United States vs. Castillero,(23 How. 468,) revieed
and shown to be entirely different from this in its facts, azd
in the legal principles applicable to it.
If the mine was on private property, the Governor was wholly
without power to make a grant of land there, for his jurisdiction nnder the colonization laws extends only so far as to
make grants of public lands.
Nor would it benefit the claimant, if it were now shown that it
was public land because his own representations prove that
he fully believed it to be private property.
A mining right or privilege under the Mexican ordinances
relating to that subject, is a title to land within the meaning
of the Act of 1851, and therefore the Board of Land Commissioners had jurisdiction to investigate a claim to such
right.
The ordinances made and established by the King of Span at
Madrid in 1783, prescribe the mode of acquiring titles to
mines, and were in force throughout the Republic of lexico
at the date of the American conquest of California.
A strict compliance with the terms and conditions of those
ordinances is required by the ordinances themselves, and is
shown to be necessary on general principles by all the writers
on the subject.
Registry is the basis of title to a mine, and no mine can be
lawfully worked until it is registered; nor can any title
thereto be acquired either by the discoverer or by any other
person without a registry.
Registry consists of an entry in a book kept by the proper
public authority

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
14. Claimant of a mining right filed with his petition an espediente
of his title certified by an Alcalde to be a true copy to the
letter from the original in his office. It was afterwards
proved that the expediente and the certificate were in the
handwriting of a party interested, who had copied them
from papers furnished by another party also interested, and
that the Alcalde had signed the certificate without seeing any
That this document is entirely unworthy
original :-eld,
of credit.
15 Claimant produced another espediente certified by a Mexican
Alcalde who could not write nor read writing. This expediento differed in some particulars from that which the
claimant filed with his petition. The Alcalde, though a
witness, was not asked to verify the document. It was in
the handwriting of another witness who swore to that fact,
but did not testify from what he had copied it :-Hekd, That
such a document, so proved, is entitled to very little conside
ration.
16. Another espediente was produced at a subsequent period which
the claimant alleged to be the original from the archives,
though it differed materially from the two others previously
alleged to be copies. A witness testified that he found it
among the records in January, 1851, but it bore no official
marks, it was never seen among the archives previous to that
time, the claimant's counsel had made affidavit in December,
1850, that the original expediente was in Mexico and could
not be produced, nor a copy of it furnished, though it had
.been diligently sought for :-Held, That this document was
not sufficiently proved, and that the testimony of Mexican
officers and assisting witnesses who swore to its execution'by
them at or about the time of its date did not establish it as
an official paper.
11 . fourtlh and still different expediente was introduced by
claimant near the close of the case. It was certified
(all but the act of possession) by an Alcalde who admitted
on his oath that the papers had been sent to him from
the mine, and he had signed the certificates without
knowing what they were. The Mexican officer and his
assisting witnesses were then called to prove that the act
of possession in this expediente was a duplicate original
Upon these and other circumstances it was :-Held, That
this expediente could not be regarded as a genuine document,
and that its production at that late stage of the case, added
to its glaring inconsistency with the evidence previously
given, had the effect, not only to impair all confidence in the
first expediente, but to discredit all the witnesses who had
sworn to the papers of which it was composed

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
18. Title to a mine is vested by the adjudication or decree of the
proper tribunal in a case duly presented for decision, and by
the registry of the adjudication, together with the proceediugs on which it is founded.
19. The mere fact of discovery without such adjudication and registry, gives no title to the discoverer, though it is also true
that without proof of discovery there can be no adjudication
in his favor.
20. To complete the adjudication and carry it into effect, the
boundaries must be fixed; else the title or claim, like other
indefinite interests in lands, will be void for uncertainty; and
this rule applies to mines situate on public as well as to those
on private lands.
21. An Alcalde had no jurisdiction under the mining laws and could
make no title to a mine. The tribunal empowered to exercise this jurisdiction was the Mining Deputation of the territory or the nearest one thereto.
22. The fact that no Mining Deputation nor no Courts of First
Instance were established in California, would show that a
law, giving jurisdiction over mines to an Alcalde, might have
been a convenience to the people, but it doe, not show that
such a law existed.
23. It may be safely inferred from the character and history of
Mexico, that its supreme government reserved to itself the
power over its mines, and 1 irposely withheld all jurisdiction
of that nature from the loc d authorities 9f its distant and
frontier territories.
24. If the Alcalde had jurisdiction it would be necessary for the
claimant to show that such jurisdiction was exercised in
accordance with the requirements of the mining ordinances.
25. Some of the provisions of those ordinances are doubtless directory, and others conditions subsequent, but some of them
are clearly conditions precedent.
26 Those provisions which appertain to the registry of the mine
and the action of the tribunal thereon, and in respect to the
judicial possession of it, are conditions precedent, and a discoverer cannot support a title without showing a substantial
compliance. Want of registry and omission to mark boundaries on the ground are fatal defects in a mining title.
97 A discoverer who neglects to have his title adjudicated and
registered agreeably to the ordinance, or to have his pertenencias measured and marked, does not by such negligence
forfeit his title; but simply fails to acquire any title which
could be the subject of forfeiture.

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
28. Claimant went to Mexico six months after the alleged date of
his mining title. He petitioned the Junta for aid and asked
a land grant, as mentioned in note 3. He asserted that he
had discovered and denounced a mine, but produced no title
papers, and falsely stated that the mine was in the Mission
of Santa Clara, suppressing the fact that it was on a private
rancho five leagues distant from that Mission. Ie requested
the Junta to recommend the approval of the possession of
the mine which had been given him by the local authorities
of California The Junta agreed to furnish the assistance
and recommended the approval or confirmation. The President approved of the agreement made by the Junta in order
to commence working the mine (as one of his ministers said)
or (according to another) for the exploration of the mine, but
made no decree concerning the title :-'Beld, That these
proceedings were not a confirmation or approval of any title
which the claimant might previously have obtained from an
Alcalde in California, and therefore, the documents produced
to show that he had such a title must stand or fall by their
own contents and the evidence which supports them on their
original merits.
29 The Court discusses numerous acts of the original claimant
and of parties interested in the mine, and especially those
disclosed in a correspondence between them, and holds these
acts to be evidence that the claimant and his aliences knew
full well the invalidity of the title which he and they were
setting up.
30. The assurance given by the Mexican Government when the
treaty of peace was under negotiation, that no title for land
in California had been made of later date than 13th Iay,
1846 ; he assent to the tenth article which contained a similar
declaration; and her acceptance of the subsequent explanations contained in a protocol which promised the protection of
the American Government only to such titles as were made
before that time, prove that M1exico herself did know, and
must have known, that the pretensions of the claimants under,
a title of later date were unfounded.
These were cross appeals, severally taken by the United
States, and by the claimants, from a decree of the District
Court for the Northern District of California, in a claim of
Andres Castillero, for land, under the Act of March 3, 1851.
Before the commencement of the proceeding, the claim had
been divided, and most of the shares in it were. held by other
persons, who, with Castillero, occupied the lands under the

name of the New Almaden Mining Comlany. But the petition
to the Board of Land Commissioners was presented by the
attorneys of the company in the name of Castillero alone, for
his benefit, and the benefit of those holding under him.
The petition set forth that Castillero discovered a mine of
cinnabar .in 1845; that having formed a company to work it,
he, on the 22d of November, and 3d of December, 1845, de
nounced it, and on the 30th of December received juridical possession in due form from the magistrate of that jurisdiction;
that the record of his mining possession was afterwards sub.
mitted to the Junta de Fomento y Administracioli de Mineria,
who declared it to be legal, and recommended to the Executive
not only that it be confirmed, but that two square leagues be
granted him on the surface of his mining possession; that the
grant of two square leagues was made on the 20th of May, 1846,
and an order or patent of titl6 issued to him on the 23d, with
which he started to take possession, but was prevented by the war;
that as soon as possible he got a survey made; that by virtue
of these facts he acquired a perfect title, under which he and his
grantees have held possession ever since 1845, expending immense sums of money upon it. The petition concludes with a
prayer that the Land Commissioner will confirm to him "the
two square leagues of land, as embraced in his mining possession and grant as aforesaid."
Along with the petition the claimants filed copies of the title
documents under which they claimed the mine and lands. The
mining title consisted of the following papers united together
in the form of an expediente.

oath, in a court of justice, that the original denouncement and
juridical possession of the mine was at that time in Mexico?
"A. I may have done so. I had copies or a copy of that original
denouncement and possession, and may have supposed then that the
original, which is usually delivered to the parties, was in Mexico.
I understood, and always have understood, it to be the practice of.
Mexican Alcaldes to make two originals of their judicial acts, one
of wh'*"" is made of record in their office, and the other delivered
to the parties interested. I probably then supposed, as I nave since,
that a dup~licate original had been given to Castillero and taken to

Mexico. I remember to have written to Mexico to have such original sent to California to be used in.the litigation then pending."
The United'States then produced the record of an ejeetment
brought by Maria Bernal de Berreyesa, widow of Jos6 Reyes
Berreyesa, against James Alexander Forbes and Robert Walkinshaw, for the land on which the mine is situate. This
record showed that on the 13th of September, 1850, the counsel
of the plaintiffs moved for an order of the Court on the defend
ants to produce in Court and file the papers upon which they
claimed the mine, "and all papers connected with the said New
Almaden Mine, or the land upon which the same is situated,
upon which the defendants intend to found their claim to said
land or said mine." This motion "was granted by the Court,
and the said papers or copies thereof were ordered to be produced
according to said motion." Mr. Halleck was of counsel with
the New Almaden Company, and as one of the attorneys for
the defendants, in that action brought by Berreyesa, he put in an
answer verified by his own affidavit, to show why the order of
the Court could not be complied with. The answer and affidavit
were as follows:

to rely as a defence in this cause, answer and say:
"That they have exercised all due diligence to procure and produce the said papers in Court, by writing immediately on the receipt
of the above mentioned order, to the parties in Mexico, *ho hold
them, but to this date the defendants have not received them, this
delay having been caused, as defendants verily believe, by the failure
of the mail steamers running from Panama to San Francisco, to
touch, as heretofore has been their custom, at the port of San Blais
in Mexico, from which place the defendants have expected, and still
expect, to receive said papers.
"The defendants therefore ask your honorable Court such furthez
time as may be necessary to procure said papers and comply with
the said order of Court.
"And the defendants further aver that the said papers and other
documents which they have sent for in Mexico, and which they are
daily expecting to receive, are absolutely necessary to them in the
above entitled cause and that they cannot proceed with the trial of
this cause without said papers and documents.
"And the defendants specify, among others, the following papers
and documents as absolutely necessary to them before they can
proceed with the trial of this cause, viz. : (1) The originalDenouncement of the M31ine of New Almaden and the Judicialpossession given
of the same in the year 1845. (2.) The confirmation of said Denouncement and possession by the Supreme Government of Mexico
in the year 1846, and prior to the late Declaration of War by the
United States against the Republic of Mexico. (3:) The original
grant of land including said mining possession, made by the Supreme
Government of Mexico (prior to the Declaration of War as aforesaid)
to the owners of said mine. (4.) The original documents showing
the ownership of said mine and land in the parties from whom the
defendants derive title: the defendants verily believing that the
land referred to in said documents is the same land as that upon
which the pretended trespass is alleged in plaintiff's complaint to
have been committed, and that these documents are absolutely
necessary for their defence.

The New Almaden Company had several judicial controversies
concerning their title to the mine. No record evidence of their
title was produced in any of them, nor does it appear that any
body having the custody of the Alcalde's archives ever discov
ered among them any papers relating to Castillero's title. B.
C. Melone, who was secretary of the Alcalde's Court before th t
establishment of the State government, and was clerk of tht
County Court afterwards, testified as follows:
-Q.During the pendency of the suit of Walkinshaw agains,
Forbes, and of the proceedings of Horace Hawes in denouncementi,
was there offered in evidence or exhibited to you, any documen'i
purporting to'be a record of the original denouncement of the
New Almaden mine, and of possessioi of said mine, given by
any Alcalde in the year 1845.
"A. There was none that I know of. I should have remembered
it if I had seen it.
"Q. Look at the paper now shown you, which is the same which
was yesterday in your presence produced by G. M. YoRll, Deputy
Recorder of the County of Santa Clara, then under examination,
and which the said Yobll testified was a paper now on file among
the records in the office, of the Recorder of said County, which
paper is endorsed, !'Posesion de la mina de Sta. Clara, Afio de

either of them.
"A. I think not. I do not remember to have ever seen this paper
until a short time since. It was shown me in the Recorder's office
of Santa Clara County.
"Q. What opportunities have you ever had for making yourself
familiar with the records and paj ers, books and documents, contained in the office of the First Alcalde of the Pueblo of San Jos6,
and of obtaining a clear knowledge of what papers were there
recorded, filed or kept.
"A. I was clerk for Judge May, both as Alcalde and Judge of the
First Instance, and aad the custody of all the books and papers in
.the office, and did the recording. After the resignation of Judge
May, which took place some time in November, 1849, and the appointment of J. C. Conroy as First Alcalde and Judge Richardson
as Judge of the First Instance, I continued to do most of the
recording, and had access to the papers and books, and had the
custody, in a manner, of said papers and books, until some time in
April, 1850, when the State Government went into operation. At
that time I took all the records, of every description, and the books
and papers belonging to all the suits in"the Court of the First
Instance, and carried them to my office as County Clerk, and
delivered such of those as I thought properly belonged to the
County Recorder's office, to John T. Richardson, the then County
Recorder.
"Q. During all this time of which you have just spoken, and all
your connection with the records of which you have just spoken,
did you ever 'ee among them, or in any of the offices of which
you have spoken, or anywhere else, the paper described in the
38th question as ' Posesion de la mina,' &c. ?

Pedro Chaboya was second Alcalde for the year 1846, and
there is an inventory in the office of the papers handed over to
him by thefirst Alcalde. This inventory is dated 2d of January,
1846, and contains among other things, this: Acta de posecion de
Mina de Santa Clara a Don Andres Castillero. There is also another
inventory dated November 10,1846, when Burton, the first person

who was appointed Alcalde of San Jos6, under American author
ity, received the archives from his Mexican predecessor. In
this no mention whatever is made of the act of possession or of
any other paper comprised in tac claimants' espediente.
Antonio Maria Pico, the Alcalde, whose name is to the act of
possession, and Antonio Suftol and Jos6 Noriega, by whom it
was signed as assisting witnesses, testif to the making of that
paper, but neither of them refer to the petitions of Castillero.
The evidence gives no account of them earlier than the time, of
their discovery by Captain Halleck, in January, 1851.
The Alcalde and his two assistants swore that the Act of Possession was written out by a man named Gutierrez, a school.
master in the neighborhood, who brought it to them to be signed
at the house of Suffol. After the signatures were affixed to it,
Guttierez took it away. Juan Fernandez was the Alcaldes
secretary at the time, and he says that it was brought by Guttierez to him, and that Gutierrez paid him three dollars and a
half for writing it, although not having %.ritten it, he was entitled'to nothing. The secretary does not seem to have done any
official act to make the paper a record, and on the subject of the
identity of the paper brought him by Gutierrez with the document produced in the cause, the following passage occurs in his
deposition:

"Q. How d6 you know 'that the document you have testified
about, is the same document that Gutierrez brought yiu ?
A. Because I know it.
"Q. Was the document which Gutierrez brought you all signed?
"A. I did not examine it well.

" Q. Did' you read it when you saw it tumbled about amongs&the
other papers ?

"Q. What was the supersuription which you always read?
"A. Possession of the mine of Santa Clara, I thirk it says. I did
not pay much attention to it.
"Q. Did you read no more than the superscription?
"A. If I read any more, I do not remember it.

"A. I imagine it is the same.
" Q. Who wrote the superscription; did you write it?
"A. I do not know who wrote it, I did not."
Pico Sutol and Noriega testify that on some day, not long
after the time-when possession of the mine was delivered, they
signed the Act of Possession at the house of Jos6 Sunol, who
lived in San Jos6. Their testimony, as to time, was not from
recollection of it, but they spoke with confidence and directnens
to the fact that the -paper was made at or near its date, an i
within a few days of the time when the act was done which :-.t
was intended to record. The document, alleged to be the origtnal, had a blank in it for the day of the month-" Decembe:,

Weekes, that supplied the day, and referred it to the 30th.

The "writing of partnership" was not in the espediente found

Jos6 Castro testified very positively that this petition was
made at the time of its date, signed by him, and sent to the
Alcalde.
The petition was in the handwriting of Benito Diaz, and he
declared on his oatli, as a witness, that it was written some
months after its date, and after the American conquest of thecountry; but the reputation of Diaz for truth and veracity was
such as to make him unworthy of credit in the opinion of' the
Court below, and that opinion, based upon the personal knowledge of the judges, was placed on record.
On the 17th day of July, 1860, the fourth espediente was
brought into -the case, accompanied by clear proof from the
.laimants' witnesses, that it had been found among the papers
of Robert Walkinshaw, deceased, who in his lifetime had been
a member of the New Almaden Company, and for a while one
,ofits principal agents. This espediente had the following cap.

by Jos4 Su-nol and Pedro Saingevain, as assisting witnesses. All
the papers comprised in this espediente and the certificates
thereto, (every thing except the signatures,) are in. the handwriting of Gutierres. Chabollo gave the following account of

Jos6 Suiol, one of the hssisting witnesses, was dead. Pedro
Sainsevain, the surviving one, deposed that his name was placed
to the documents by himself, at the time of the date. but he did
not say whether the certificate was true or false, and appears
to have signed it without thinking it his duty to inquire for the
original. Two witnesses, Messrs. Sloan and Marks, testified to
declarations of Sainsevain that the certificates were made in
1848, and not in 1846.
There was no certificate to the Act of Possession, as found in
this, expediente. The claimants alleged it to be a duplicate
original, and to prove it, such called Pico, Noriego and Suaol,
whose testimony accorded with the allegation. Neither of
these witnesses had spoken in their former depositions of more
than one original being made.
This Act of Possession, was dated 30th of December, 1845,
there being no bliank as in the other original.
All these expbdientes were alike in some points, but n, two of
them corresponded in all respects. Some of the points of diffeience were important and remarkable. But they are sufficiently set out in the opinion of Mr. Justice Clifford.
A considerable portion of this voluminous record is occupied
by evidence of the statements and declarations of Castillero

from Manuel Castro to Pico; dispatches from Mr. Larkin, United
States Consul at Monterey, to Mr. Buchanln, then Secretary of
State; articles from Mexican newspapers; letters from Mr.
Larkin to Mr. Judd, Prime Minister of the King of Hawaii, and
a newspaper entitled the"Polyninia,"printed in the Sandwich
Islands-were given in evidence by the claimants, furnishing'-the ground of much remark in the Court below, and some little
here; but inasmuch as they do not appear to have been noticed
by this Court, it is not considered necessary to insert them inthe report.
There was much parol testimony concerning the condition of
the mine, the alleged discovery of it by Castillero, the work
done at it, the possession -given to him by the Alcalde, and
the subsequent occupation of it by him and his alienees.
It is sitifate about fifty-five miles southeast from San Francisco, in a valley called "La Canada de los Capitancillos."
This valley is bounded by the Sierra Azul on the south, and the
Puebla hills on the north. It is watered by several streams,
which rise in the mountains and find. their outlet at the northwestern end of the valley, running thence towards the Pacific.
On the north side the land is nearly level or slightly inclining
to-the southwest, but nearer to the mountain, on the south side
there runs, on a parallel with .he mountain, a range of hills,
talled lomas bjos-low hills. These hills were regarded by
some of the witnesses as part of the Sierra, and by others they
were considered as being entirely distinct. It is in them that
the quicksilver was found, and from an old opening in a peak,
near the eastern end of the range,- came the ore which Castillero
used in his experiments.
For many years-probably long before the advent of the
Spaniards into that country-the Indians knew that the'cinnabar,
of which the lomas bajos were in a measure composed, was
neither common earth nor common rock, for it was ruby red,
and nearly two and a half times as heavy as sand stone In
fact it was a bi-sulphide of mercury, some of it almost as pure

as the vermilion of the shops. The Indians used it to paint
their faces and bodies. Afterwards a quantity was dug out and
carried to Santa Clara to paint the Mission Church. In 1824
and 1835, attempts were made to work it as a silver mine
Late in the autumn of 1845, Castillero came to California on
business, which took him to Sutter's fort. He left that place on
the 12th of November, and went to Santa Clara. Some of the
ore being shown to him, he pronounced it silver with a ley
of gold. The last of November, or first of December, at Santa
Clara, he detected the presence of quicksilver in it, as shown by
the following testimony of Jacob P. Leese.
"About the latter part of November, or first of December, 1845,
I went into the mission of Santa Clara to dine with Padre Real of
the mission; Mr. Castillero was there. Our general conversation
through dinner was about this mine, and of experiments which
Castillero had been trying, to find out what the mineral was. He
made a remark, and said he thought he knew what it was; if it was
was what he supposed it was, he had made his fortune. We were
anxious to know what it was. He got up from the table and
ordered the servant to pulverize a portion of this ore; after it was
pulverized he ordered the servant to bring in a hollow tile full
of lighted coals; he took some of the powdered ore and threw it
on the coals; after it got perfectly hot he took a tumbler of water
and sprinkled it on the coals with his fingers; he then emptied the
tumbler and put it over the coals upside down; then took the
tumbler off and went to the light to look at it; then made the remark that it was what he supposed it was, "quicksilver." He showed
all who were there the tumbler, and we found that it was frosted
with minute globules of the metal, which Castillero collected with
his finger and said it was quicksilver. He then said: to-morrow
he would test it thoroughly and find out what it was worth, he con
sidered it very rich on account of the weight of the ore, and if it
proved as rich as the quicksilver mines in Spain, that the M1exican
Government had offered to any one for the discovery of such a mine
in the Republic of Mexico, one hundred thousand dollars."

extrinsic evidence to show at which of the* plaues it was written,
or when it was written, or that it was delivered to 'the Alcalde by
Castillero, or sent.to him, or that Castillero was seen to sign it, or
known to have it in his hands. It is in the handwriting of Juan
Castenada, whose deposition was not taken. The testimony is
equally silent on the subject of the supplementary petition, which,
however, is dated in all the copies at Santa Clara, and. is also in
the handwriting of Castenada. Several witnesses declared their
belief that the name of Castillero, as signed to both petitions,.
was in his handwriting. It was admitted in this Court,that the
writing of partnership, dated 2d of November, 1845, must have
been misdated, and could not have been -made until after the
experiment testified to by Leese, which was the last of November
or first of December.
Upon these papers, and the accompanying parol evidence, the
claimants contended that Castilleio was the discoverer of the
mine, since they show that he was the first to find metal in it.'
The United States, on the other hand, maintained that the dis.
covery of a mine consisted in ascertaining its situation, the extent and direction of-the vein, the true character of its product4
and whatever else might be necessary to give a correct idea of
its value; that Castillero had learned none of these things; that
when he made his original petition, he was utterly ignorant
even of the metal, believing the cinnabar to b6 silver with an
alloy of gold; that when he put in his supplemental petition he
mistook it for duch a combination as nature never made-gold
silver, and liquid quicksilver-and this blunder he persisted in
to the last; that the mine was never actually discovered, or its
real contents known, as a discoverer should know tnem, until
Alexander Forbes explored it in January, 1846
After the date of Castillero's second petition, h employed a
man named Chard to reduc6 some of the ore. He took a gunbarrel, charged it with pieces of ore the size of a bean, stopped
the touch-hole with clay, put the muzzle in a vessel of water and
built a fire around the other end. The heat drove off the mercury in the form of vapor, which passing out at the muzzle,
was condensed in the water, and precipitated itself to the bottom

in the form of liquid metal. Several gun-barrels,-as many aa
three or four,-were used in this way at once, and the work was
'kept up for a month or six weeks. While this was going on, the Alcalde, Pico, Suriol, Noriega.
Fernandez, Gutierrez, Padre Real, and some other persons, came
to the mine where Chard was at work with his gun-barrels, and
the thing was done which the claimants assert was the delivery
of juridical possession, Pico was examined three times in this
case, and once in the adverse case of Berreyesa, and his several
depositions, relating to the delivery of possession, are not without serious contradictions; some of which are adverted to in
the opinion of the Court. All the witnesses concur in saying
that there was no survey or marking of the pertenencias, nor
was there any professor present, or other person skilled in mining,
or competent to inspect it and declare its character. Chard
could not recollect that Castillero was present; the other witnesses testified that he was there.
Some time after this -transaction Chard built a furnace nea
the creek, and packed down the ore to be reduced there; but
some defect in the construction of the furnace made it a total
failure. Some old try pots were then procured, and by turning
them bottom upwards over a heap of ore, providing a mode of
conducting the vapor to the water, and setting fire to three or
four cords of wood over each one, he obtained a quantity of
quicksilver, which was not weighed, but it could not have been
less altogether than two thousand pounds. This continued until
August, when Chard, and the Indians who were- helping him,
suddenly quit work and left the place. Nothing whatever was
done at or about the mine until April or May of the next year,
when Walkinshaw and Alden came there. Alden testifies that
he took charge of it as agent for the claimants, but he does not
mention what specific thing was done by him. In November,

from Tepic with workmen, money, and other appliances for business. The mine was thoroughly examined, and in January,
1848, the operations which have yielded so large a result were
fairly: commenced.

Castitlero left California in March, aiad arrived in the city of
Mcxice in May, where he memorialized the Junta de Mineria. or
Board for the Encouragement of Mining, as will be seen by the
documents hereafter to be mentioned. He never returned to Cali.
fornia. In the winter of 1846-7, he sold certain shares of the
mine to Barron, Forbes & Co., of Tepic, as well, as to other
persons, and contracted for the habilitation of it. The bargaining on the part of Barron, Forbes & Co. was done by Mr. Negrete,
to whom- Castillero showed the writing of partnership as his
mining title, and that paper alone was recited in all the acts of
sale made by him and his alienees and socios down to the year
1882.
Immediately after Castillero's arrival at the City of Mexico, he
commenced the proceedings which were given in evidence by
the claimants as proof that the mining title was confirmed by
the Supreme Government, and that a grant at the same time bad
been made to him of two square leagues as a colonist. The six
following papers constituted that part of the title.

forty-six and eighteen hundred and forty-seven.
"I, Andres Castillero, resident and miner in the Department of
Upper California, before your Excellency and your Honor, as I best
may proceed, say: That, having discovered in the mission of Santa
Clara a mile of quicksilver, of leyes as rich, certainly, as were ever
seen before, not only in the Republic, but perhaps in all the world,
as proved by the assays made by the order of the Junta Facultativa
of the College of Mining, which, mixing together of all the specimens I brought, from the best to the worst, have given a result of
thirty-five and a half per cent., while there have been specimens of
the best kind which must produce much greater leyes, I see myself
in a condition to satisfy my desires in favor.of the progress of my
country, of lienefiting exclusively Mexicans by the flattering and
well-founded hopes which such a discovery offers. In virtue of this
r have denounced and taken possession not only of said mine named
Sdanta Clara, but also of an extent of three thousand varas in all
directionsfrom said point. I have formed a company to work it. I

scribed by the ordinance, the mine yielding ore, with the notable
circumstance that the specimens which I brought and which have
been assayed have been taken out Df the mouth. It would have
been very easy for me to have given the necessary extension to the
negotiation by accepting the repeated and advantageous offers which
have been made to me by several foreign houses in California ; but
the undertaking d]oes not require that kind of assistance, which
would result in advantage to foreigners, when it may be entirely
national, and I have not, for that reason, hesitated to apply to
your Excellency and your Honors to obtain the small and only
resources which I need. These are reduced to a small advance of
five thodfsand dollars in money, in consideration of the excessive
scarcity-of coin in that Department, and the quick remittance to it
of retorts, cylinders, and other small distilling apparatus, and alsc
iron flasks for bottling up the quicksilver.
"I would have :proposed a contract of partnership to the Junta,
an avio, or some other agreement, if there had been time to be sble
to furnish the proofs and details which would be required for said
contracts; but being compromised by the Supreme Government to
leave this Capital within a few days, I find it necessary to restrict
myself to that which appears to present no difficulty, and which may
open a way to our future agreement.
. "I am well persuaded that the Junta will accede to my
request,
ao far as may be within its power, and that it will send up to the
Supreme 'Government with a recommendation that which may require the decision of the latter.
"My propositions, then, are the following:
First.-The Junta, in the act of approving the agreement, will
give me a draft for five thousand dollars on some mercantile house
in Mazatlan.
"Second.-On my part, I bind myself to place in said port, within
six months after leaving it, fifty quintals of quicksilver, at the rate
of one hundred dollars each, which I will send from the first taken
out, with absolute preference over every other engagement.
"Third.-The Juntfi will order that there be placed at my disposition before leaving the Capital, the eight iron retorts which it has
in its office, and all ibc quicksilver flasks which can be found in the
negociacion of Tasco, which are fit for use; and lastly, it will delivez

to Se-nor Don Tomas Ramon del Moral, my attorney, tie sums to
pay for the retorts, cylinders, and other kinds of small apparatus,
which may be ordered to be made for the negociation,to the amount
of one thousand dollars.
"1Fourth.-Iwill receive the retorts of the Junta at cost price,
and the flasks which I may select at two dollars a piece, agreeably
with their valuation.
"1Fifth.-The ascertained value of said retorts and flasks, and
that of the sums which may be delivered to Sefior Moral, I will
return in the term of one year from this agreement, and also the
premium on the draft on Mazatlan, in quicksilver, placed in said
port at the price of one hundred dollars the quintal; but if the
Junta should wish to take one or more "acciones" in the mine, it
shall be left as a part payment of the sum corresponding to one ot
more barras.
"Sixth.-While the company is being formed, during-the period
of one year, counted from the date on which this agreement shall be
approved, and the five thousand dollars spoken of in the first proposition being paid, I will give the preference to the Junta in the
sale of quicksilver placed in Mazatlan, at the rate of one hundred
dollars the quintal.
" Seventh.-The Junta shall represent to the Supreme Government
the necessity of appr6ving the possession which has been given me
of the mine by the local authorities of California, in the same terms
as those in which I now hold it.
"Eighth.-It shall also represent the advantage of their being
granted to me, as a colonist, two square leagues upon the land of
my mining possession, with the object of being able to use the wood
for my business.
".irdh.-For the compliance of this contract'I pledge the mine
itself and all its appurtenances.
"The subscriber subjects this request to the deliberation of the
Junta, which, if accepted, may be made into a formal contract, and
made legal in tte most proper manner.

says to me as follows: ' Most Excellent Sir :-The Junta Facultativa having examined the documents which your Excellency
referred to on the twenty-first of the present month, relative to a
deposit of cinnabar discovered in California by Sefior Don Andres
Castillero, and another of coal on the Bay of San Francisco, has
the nonor to h.iform your Excellency that the specimens sent by
said Senor Castillero were deposited, some in the Mineralogical
Cabinet, and others assayed by the Professor of Chemistry, Don
Manuel Herrera. The assay gave a ley of thirty-five and a half
per cent., a mean of the different specimens having been taken to
make the assay, for there are some so rich that they are pure cinnabar. The Junta believes that Se5or Castillero has, by such an
important discovery, made himself deserving of the efficacious protection of the Supreme Government and of the Junta for the
Encouragement of Mining, and is persuaded that your Excellency
will interpose all your influence to the end that this individual may
receive a proof that the Supreme Gov.ernment knows how to distinguish and reward those citiiens who contribute to the prospcrity
of the country.'
And ivith this motive, I repeat to your Excellency the considerations o'f my esteem and respect. And I have the honor to transmit

Seffor Castillero what kind of aid or protection he needs for the
encourangement of his brilliant enterprise, congratulating' the
,Supreme Government on a discovery, which, if it meets, from the
beginning, with all the protection it deserves, may change completely the aspect of our mining, freeing it from the necessity in
which it has been until now, of foreign quicksilver. With this
motive, the Junta takes advantage of the opportunity to inform
your Excellency that, as on the twenty-fourth of this month, the
bounty terminates which the law granted, of five dollars premium
on bach hundred-weight of quicksilver extracted from the mines of
the nation, the miners of Guadalcazar hive proved that they have

of the gi aitest consideration. The junta is consequently of opinion
rhat there should be immediately furnished to Selior Castillero the
sum of five thousand dollars, in the terms he proposes; that it
should be authorized to furnish him with the iron retorts and flasks
belonging to it, and the other thousand dollars, which can be employed in the construction of retorts, cylinders, and other small
apparatus of distillation for said mine; although the law authorizing the Junta to make loans for the encouragement of deposits of
quicksilver exacts a premium of five per cent. per annum on the
capital loaned, it cannot be doubted that the proposal of Senor
Castillero to pay the five thousand dollars with fifty quintals of
quicksilver placed in Mazatlan, at the disposition of the junta, at
the rate of one hundred dollars each, and in the term of six months,
offers greater advantages to the fund than the said interest. The
urgency shown by Sehor Castillero to undertake his journey to that
department, and that which his so doing may contribute under
present circumstances towards the preservation of the National
territory, is, in the opinion of the Junta, a sufficient motive to leave
until a more opportune occasion the formation of a contract of
partnership, or of "avio" for the encouragement of said mine. It
remains, then, tp show to your Exc 4lency that, although the possession given to Sefior Castillero by tLe local authorities of California
has not been in conformity with the ordinance, inasmuch as there
have been granted him "pertenencias" to the extent of three
thousand varas, which are equivalent to fifteen "pertenencias,"
agreeably to the second article of the eighth title; yet it is necessary to consider that he has in his favor the qualification of being
discoverer of an absolutely new hill, in which there was no mine open,
and to such there is granted in the first article of the sixth title
three "pertenencias," either continuous or interrvpted ;" and if he
shall hace discovered other veins, one ("pertenencia ") in each of
them. He has also in his favor the circumstance that he works it
in company with others, to whom there is granted that without
prejudice to the right which they may have by the title of dis.
coverers, when they are such, they may denounce four new pertenencias, even though they are contiguous and in the same direction;
but that which is most worthy of consideration is that Californias
being a frontier department, and frequently threatened by the
emigrants from the United States of the north, and by the new
colonists of Oregon, it seems proper to grant to the first mine

discovered in a department so extensive a greater number of
"pertenencias," which view is corroborated by the reason found
at the end of the eighth title, Article 1st, which says: "Considering
that the limits established in the mines of these kingdoms, to which
those of New. Spain have until now been made to conform, and are
very contracted in proportion to the multitude, abundance, and
richness of the metallic veins which the goodness of the Creator has
been pleased to grant to those regions, I order and command that
in mines which may hereafter be discovered in a new vein or without
neighbors, these measurements be observed. 2d. Along the thread,
direction, or course of the vein, be it of gold, silver, or any other
metal, I grant to every miner, without distinction of the discovererb,
(wh have their reward already assigned to them,) two hundred
Castilian varas, called 'varas de medir,' measured on a level"
Lastly, in the first article, eleventh title, there are expressed these
terms: "And because the capital of a single individual may not be
sufficient for great undertakings, while that of all the partners may
be, I will and command that such companies be encouraged, promoted, and protected by all convenient measures, my viceroy
granting to those who may form such, every favor, aid, and exemption which can be granted them according to the judgment and
discretion of the royal tribunal of mines, and without detriment to
the public and my royal treasury." In reference to the ownership
of two square leagues which Senor Castillero solicits, as a colonist,
upon the surface of his mining property, for the purpose of supplying himself with the firewood necessary for the reduction of oies,
(beneficio,) the Junta not having the necessary information on the
matter of which the Supreme Government has abundance, his Excellency the President will decide as he may think proper. In this
view the Junta, in sending up to your Excellency the petition
of Senor Castillero, has no hesitation in recommending it very
efficaciously on account of the vital importance of the undertaking,
and its incredible influence upon the general good and prosperity of
the Republic.
The Junta has the honor, on this occasion, to repeat to you

such as were registered in the books of the several departments,
and that they corresponded perfectly with the borradors existing
in other cases. Some of them swore to their personal knowledge of the fact that the documents were issued and the records
of them made up at the times when they respectively bore date.
By some of them was proved Castillero's exhibition of quicksilver ores to the Junta and the College of Mining; the assays
of it, and the results. Their testimony also showed that a report
to -the Congress was made and printed in the fall of 1846, in
which Castillero's discovery of quicksilver in California was
referred to at some length.
Francisco Martinez Negrete, a merchant residing at Guada

of hau-as and other transactions of Castillero with Barron, Forbes

counsel, to the President of the United States, the Secretary of

regularity and propriety of taking depositions in Mexico.

you at home. I am still here preparing the apparatus for making a
better trial of the ores, but -as Mr. Wallis, the artizan, is unwell, we
go on but slowly. I am also very anxious to have the mine cleared
out and put in a proper working state before I leave it, and for this
purpose we have been sinking a 'Plan ' at the 'Respaldo Alto ' in
order to run a 'Testero ' across the vein, and to discover the value
and abundance of the ores in its whole width. In doing this, we
have most unexpectedly found that in this ' plan ' there are no cinnabar whatever, although oier it, in the upper part of the vein,
there are ores. This puzzles Ls greatly, but we hope that in cutting

across we will fall in again with ores towards the ' Respaldo Bajo.'
Can this mine be a 'Manto?' I must verify that, and so must you
and the Padre with your own eyes. I see very good ores in the
upper part of the mine in all directions, but why does it get into
Borra lower down? The Plan is about five varas lower down than
when you and the Padre wrought, and on the other side of the vein.
The people will go on cutting across, and when they again get into
' Metal' I will send you a man on purpose. I am confident we shall
find them, but there will always be about two varas or more of the
vein next the 'Respaldo Alto ' without ores; at least I think so,
and hope nothing worse may be the case. We still see good ores
on the upper part of the vein near the ' Respaldo Bajo,' where you

fear this mine wl be reduced to this cinta, and the great body of it
will be tepetate muerto; but, perhaps, the cinta may be wider below
than it is above. To see whether this is so or not, has been the
object of our labors since discovering the proper direction of the vein
of the whole mine, which discovery makes everything more plain.
This direction was before entirely mistaken; of which and other
things we will have a great deal to talk about when we meet. When
Mr. Walkinshaw arrives and takes a look at the mine, I tlhink we

me that it contained newspapers and as I knew General Miller's

courage in prosecuting the war than before, and has recalled Mr.
Trist, desiring the Mexicans to send to Washington if they wanted
peace. I have, as you know, always thought that on their getting
possession of a great part of Mexico, and their volunteers covering
themselves with glory, the war would become popular, and they would
go ahead and possess themselves of the whole of the Mexican Republic-particularly when they have got over the fears of European
interference.

to be reinstated in the possession of that property, both mine and
hacienda, in two or three days hence, by judicial process.
"Although I feel much gratified at my successful defence of the

event that those parties should succeed in purchasing the part of

"You will now readily perceive the great importance of my
advice to you to purchase a part both of the lands of Cook and Df
the Berreyesas. You were of the opinion that this measure would
not be necessary, in view of the supposed facility of getting the tilde
to the mine perfected in Mlexico.
"It is now more than five months since it was decided that
Castillero should procure the necessary documents in that city, and
that they should be sent to me as soon as possible. On the one
hand, I depend upon the precarious and illegal possession of the
mine, granted by the Alcalde of this district to Castillero, who
was, in reality, the judge of the quantity of land given by the
Alcalde; and, on the other side, I am attacked by the purchasers
of the same land, declared by Castillero himself to comprise the
mine. In the absence of the all-important document of the ratification of the possession so given, I am compelled to purchase the
part of the land of the Berreyesas which Walkinshaw and his party
have offerd to purchase, and you must not be surprised if I shall
go far beyond the price that they have offered, because it is the
only mode of securing the title to the mine and hacienda; for, if
Castillero should fail in getting the desired documents from Mexico,
is the sole mode of safety of this property.

.and you will do in this affair as your best judgment will direct you,
keeping in view that at all hazard and at whatever cost the property
of the mine must be secured. Castillero we expect will soon be
here from Lower California, and if anything can be done in Mexico
he is the fittest person to procure what may be wanted. It is
incredible that Mr. Walkinshaw should lend himself to such proceedings when he considered the very large capital invested in this
enterprise, and when he well knows that by the mining laws no
"denuncio" could possibly be heard under the circumstances in
which this mine has been occupied. We trust, however, that these
vile machinations will by your active proceedings be put an end
to.
"We hope you will by the time this reaches you have got up at
least a part of the apparatus, and that some of it will be soon at
work. The price of quicksilver here still keeps up, and the supply
as yet not abundant. Every body writes of the very high price it

that other proceedings will not be resorted to, and that principle

realize as much as possible of the large capital which now lies in
the mine, laid out by the habilitadores, and to secure to the owners
of barras something certain against an evil day which may some
time or other overtake us.

Goyernor was perhaps necessary to make the grant valid, whereas
the other being addressed directly to D. Andres did not require
that formality, nor was any other proceeding necessary, thus making
it a better document than the greater part of the other titles for
lands in California. I fear you may have made use of the notarial
copy sent-if not, you will of course apply for the copy of the one
at Monterey. I however, have hopes that your well known cleverness will have enabled you to find out this mistake, which would
show itself, if you had applied for the document from Monterey.
And at all events you may be enabled to withdraw the one sent lind
substitute the other; either, however, I take to be as good as the
usual California titles, few of which havd been officially delivered or
sanctioned by the local authorities.

in the city of Mexico when I purchased the Bars from Castillero,
for the purpose of securing his consent and approval of the contract
of Habilitacion; in this document is also inserted the grant of the

so many already, and which can only tend to lessen his own profits.
"It is clearly to be understood that no verbal agreement was made
here with any one, nor any promises given which is not consistent
with the contract as it is written. His brother never was engaged ;
on the contrary he told me that his brother went to see what could
be done in California, and if nothing offered he would send him
back to take our portraits. This might have been said as a joke,
but shows that no employment at the mine was intended for him.
"No maintenance for himself (Dr. T.) or family was ever intended.
He looked out here for a cook and took up one for that purpose.
His new contract is much more advantageous than his former one
with me, as he has his percentage on the whole two-thirds without
limitation. I have read over this second contract with care, and it"
appears to me quite clear in respect to his charge at the hacienda.
"'AT. 2. The aforesaid Jam~s Tobin agrees to direct the operations of the extraction of the quicksilver to "the best of his abilities,
and is to have the said operations under his exclusive management.'
"This does not show that he shall have the general management
of the hacienda.
"One of the causes for altering the contract, and for cancelling
the limitation of his profits was, to-make the contract less onerous
as to the supply of ores, people and necessaries, which you will perceive by the 4th article. You are only bound to supply 'as amply as
circumstanceswill allow,' whereas, by the original contract with me,
it was obligatory on us to supply all those which he might require.
"This, in the present state of things, is, I consider, of much
consequence.
"This is my opinion of what Mr. Tobin has a right t,demand,
but I am sure you will not stand on mere points of right, or risk
the interests of negotiation for trifling pretensions which may be
put forth. Much must be sacrificed in principles to conciliate a
troublesome person, and I still most earnestly hope that your prudence will enable you to keep up cordiality between you. I shall

January, which went by last month's steamer, to which I refer. I
have since received your letters by Reyes dated the 27th and 31st
of December, and 8th of January. I shall not go minutely into
the whole valuable information you give me, nor into the statements
so very interesting to myself and those concerned in the mine of
New Almaden. By those cowrmunications I have every reason to
believe that, by your indefatigable and energetic proceedings you
will be enabled to defeat all the vile attempts which have been made
to rob the legitimate owners of their property.
"The conduct of Dr. Tobin is inexplicable, but I think I can perceive that you are somewhat of opinion that he may be heard and
protected by the Company, but I will at once put you right upon
that point, and assure you such will not be the case. All Jiere are
most indignant at his conduct. You must, and will, be supported,
and all I wish and hope for on your part is, that you act in a manner towards him which may enable you if possible tW avoid a rupture
and contentions which may lead to bad results. You say that Dr.
Tobin comes down in the next steamer, if so,. he will be here in a
fewdays. This I shall not be sorry for, for the matter wouldthen be
soon settled. He would most assuredly not be asked to' rethrn, nor
even permitted. He has nolrightto desert his post, and I hope you•
have not given him leave of absence. I have no doubt but that you
could, withGay, Alden, and the other person you mention, do well
enough for a time, and easily put up a part of the apparatus and
work it until a proper scientiie person can be procured and sent up
to you.
[ t so happens that almost the whole of the "accionistas" and

"aviadores" of the mine will be here in a few days. Mr. Barron in
now here, and is attorney for those absent. La Torre comes here
to visit Mr. B. Castillero has returned and is also here, so am I
and William Forbes. This leaves out only the four California bars,
and I think I may venture to act for you, if necessary, as you verbally told me I might. This will give us power to deal wil h Dr.
Tobin if he comes this way, and to regulate any other matters which
may be thought necessary. For my own part I have no power, as
you know, the management being in the hands of others, and therefore, I beg you will take all I say as purely rricate and confidential,
without attaching any authority to my saggestions. But, of course,
as I am a proprietor, and in the confidence of the managers and
other proprietors, my opinions and advice may be worth attending
to, and be of some use to yourself as well as to them. I shall continue to write to you as long as I remain here, and will be most
happy at all times to hear from you.
I "I wrote by last packet to Dr. Tobin as a friend, and-attempted
to conciliate him in a mild way, perhaps he makes too much of this
I-tter, and I think it better to send you a copy to enable you to see
exactly what I have said to him. His leaguing himself with Mr.
Walkinshaw is too bad. Reyes has told me of all that has passed,
which is almost incredible. I am glad to find that you are peaceably
to get rid of Mr. W. Mr. Tobin has sent a plan of his proposed
establishment, this you must on no account allow to be put in
execution. You are aware that it would never do to go about
large magnificent works at once, particularly as you know the
whole must be at the cost of the "aviadores" and left for the
proprietors at the end of the contract. You are acting for the
aviadores, and it is your duty to restrict the works within reasona2le bounds, and to only erect temporary, and absolutely necessary,
works until some funds shall be realized from the mine. However
desirous that it may be that the works should be set up by Dr.
Tobin, yet if he will not go on in good faith, or if he attempts to
injure the company, 'or. refusea to obey your just commands, and
resists your authority, or stops -r impedes the works, and thereby
breaking his contract, I think he may be discharged by you, always
taking care that you have a very clear case, and nothing left in
doubt to cause litigation. But this is only my private opinion. I
have no authority to empower you to do so, but it would no doubt
be approved by the company, none of whom look favorably on the

DECmMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
Doctor's proctedings. The most effectual and safe way, however,
would be his coming here without leave. He has not written by
last opportunity, nor will he be written to by this steamer.
"I have every reason to believe that the documents you mention
will be found in the City of Mexico, and as Mr. Castillero will
return there they will no doubt be procured, but we are at some
loss to know what is exactly wanted; and I beg you will, by next
steamer, give a sketch of the documents you allude to, particularly
a description of the limits of the grant. I think -ou must not
have received the information sent you of the existence of'the
grant of the tw6 sitios directly to Castillero, and registered in
Monterey, nor am I sure if this will mend. the matter. In a few
'days, however, we will again hear from you and act accordingly.
"One last resort I will mention to you, and it is with great
repugnance that I do so, which is, that if the Berreyesas were
unreasonable and untractable, or insist on the extensiun of their
lands to our hacienda, the company would be justified in promoting
the invalidation of their own title to their Rancho.
"If they make it over to any one else, and particularly to our
enemies, certainly this course must be pursued. If no opposition
or disclosures are made, and if the American Government turn out
to be liberal in conceding the Ranchos to the present holders, the
Berreyesas and others may be left in possession; but if active
measures were taken by an adverse party, many of the titles would
be worthless, and I have reason to think from what came to our
knowledge when I was in California, the title of the Berreyesas is
not of the best. This I throw out for your consideration and I
should think th~se people would do themselves no good in opposing
you.
"We think at present that it may be the best place to get an
authenticated copy of the approval of the Mexican Government of
the grant of three thousand varas given by the Alcade on giving
-possession of the mine. As a doubt may have started as to whether
the Alcalde, acting as the "Juez de Mineria," had a right to make
this grant, yet if approved by the Government of Mexico before the
possession of the country. by the Americans, there could be no
doubt on the subject. This takes in our hacienda, and iinless
opposed by the Berreyesas would, I should think, settle the
question.
"Castillero says such approval was given, and that on ls arrival

SUPREME COURT.

in Mexico he will procure a judicial copy of it. This is the plan
we shall adopt if we hear nothing from you to alter this resolution.
Since writing the foregoing I have looked over your private letter
to Win. Forbes, dated 18th October, and find you state the limits
or boundaries as follows.
"The boundaries must be expressed as joining on the north and
northwest by lands of the ranchqs de San Vicente and de los
Capitaneillos, and on the east, south and west by Serainia or
' tierras baldias.'
"Castillero is not certain of accomplishing this latter plan, and
thinks the first, that is, the 3,000 varas, the best.

Mr. -Barron has procured documents to confirm this view of the

"If it was not that I am an interested party I would recommend
to them to secure .their Rancho by silence, for I am well assured
that by adopting hostile measures against us they may lose it
altogether. The Rothschilds have a large quantity of quicksilver
on hand, and the miners thought that by competition between
them and New Almaden it might come down greatly in. price, and
kept off from purchasing, but an agreement has been come to

"Monterey, March 28, 1848.
"MY DEAR Siu :-I have to apologize for not writing you before
this, as I promised I would, respecting the purchase of your shares
in the mine of New Almaden, but really, as your opinion of their
value is so widely different from mine, I considered it almost hopeless to make you any further proposals.
"I do not, however, leave this without making the necessary
arrangements to effect that object, and have therefore authorized
Mr. Walkinshaw and Manl. Dias to wait on you with my final
offer for the purchase of those shares.
"Were I not already so deeply interested in this negotiation I
would never think of investing another dollar in it, but this interest renders it necessary for me to have the control of all the
shares, in order that I may dispose of the whole, whenever an
opportunity may offer, and save myself from the heavy loss that
would ensue, should it unluckily leak out that, in fact the documents procured by Castillero in Mexico, as his title to the mine
and lands, were all obtained long after the occupation of California by the Americans.

serious objections might be made even to the legality of our new

room and his carp et-bag were both locked, and he did not per

ments, but seriously iujured his credit. In addition to this, the
claimantg attacked his general character.
James J. Birney was called to support the statement of Forbes,
and he swore that the copy of the letter offered in evidence was
made:by him; that it was a true copy; that he knew the handwriting of Alexander Forbes, and that the original, from which
he copied it, was written by Alexander Forbes. - The answer of
the claimants, to Birney's testimony, was the production of witnesses who swore that his *reputationfor veracity was not such
as to make him safe witness.
When Mr. Trist went out-jo Mexico, in 1848, tc negotiate s
treaty of peace, he was instructed by Mr. Buchanan, the Secretary of State, to insist upon a cession of certain territory, and to
stipulate that all grants, in the ceded .territories,made by Mexico,
after the 13th of May, 1846, should be absolutely null and void.
Mr. Trist reported to the State Department the treaty made
by himself and the- Mexican Commissioners, which contained the
following declaration on the part of Alexico:
"The Mexican Government declares that no grant whatever of
lands inTexas has been made since the second day of March, one

thousand eight hundred and thirty-six; and that no grant whatever
of land, in any of the territoriesaforesaid, has been made since the
thirteenth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and forty-six."
Mr. Trist, in his dispatch to the State Department of January
25, 1848, (accompanying the treaty,) explains why the treaty had
taken this form instead of the stipulation which he had been in-

structed to make.
"With respect," said he, "to grants of land made by the Mexican
authorities, the proviso contained in my instructions was strenuously
objected to upon a point of national honor and decorum. No such
grants had been made since the 13th JVay, 1846. This they knew,
and consequently the proviso could have no practical effect. But it
is implied that they have been made, or might have been made, and
that, nevertheless, the Government committed the injustice of revoking
them ; which, in fact, it had authority to do. Moreover, it involved
an acknowledgement that, from the day when hostilities broke out
on the north of the Rio Bravo, the llexican Government had lost the
right to make grants of land in any part of its territory subsequently
occupied by us. Feeling the force of these objections, I requested to
make sure of the fact stated by them, and also in regard to no grants
having been made in Texas since the revolution, which had been
incidentally mentioned by one of them, (the Mexican negotiators.)
And this having been done in a manner which left no shade of doubt
on their minds, the declaration which will be found at the end of
Article 10, was agreed upon in lieu of the proviso."
After the treaty had been ratified by the President and Senate
of the United States, with some amendments, Messrs. Clifford, of
Maine, and Sevier, of Arkansas, were sent out as commissioners to
exchange ratifications with the Mexican Government. Their despatches to the State Department, only a part of which has been
printed, show that there was much discussion between them and
the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs on the subject of the land
grants, and particularly with respect to the effect which might be
produced upon the titles by the suppression of the 10th Article
The necessary explanation was given to quiet these fears. The
dispatches do not state specifically what the explanations were,
because the substance of them was written down in the form of a
protocol and signed by the representatives of the two Governments.

The following is the explanation referred to, so far as it relates to
this subject:

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
"The American Government, by suppressing the tenth Article of
the treaty of Guadalupe, did not in any way intend to annul the
grants of land made by Mexico in the ceded territories. These
grants, notwithstanding the suppression of the Article of the Treaty,
preserve the legal value which they may possess; and the grantees
may cause their legitimate titles to be acknowledged before the
American tribunals.
"Conformably to the law of the United Statesi legitimate titles to
every description of property, pergonal and real, existing in the
ceded territories are those which were legitimate. titles under the
Aexzcan law in Californiaand New Mexico up to the 13th of May,
1846, and in Texas up to the 2d of March, 1836.

"And these explanations having been accepted by the Minister of
Foreign Affairs of the Mexican Republic, he declared in the name
of his Government, that, with the understanding conveyed by them,
the said Government would proceed to ratify the treaty of Guadalupe
as modified by the Senate and Government of the United States."
Most of the evidence was given after the cause came into the
District Court. This is but an outline of it. Many documents
and numerous details of fact, some of them not altogether without a certain degree. of importance, are unavoidably omitted;
the object being to give only such as appeared necessary to
make the arguments of counsel and the opinion of the Court
intelligible.
The Land Commission (Mr. Commissioner Thompson, dissenting,) confirmed the title of the claimants "to the mine, with the
right of enjoying the privileges as mine owner, under the Mexican law, of three thousand varas in every direction from the
mouth of the mine." All the Commissioners concurred in
rejecting the claim to two leagues, under the Lanzas dispatch.
The claimant appealed to the District Court from so much of
the decree "as rejects his claim for two square leagues of land
granted to him in clonization,". and-the United States appealed
from that part whid. confirms the mining privilege.
The opinion of the District Judge was in favor of confirming
the claimant's title to the two leagues under the dispatch, but
the Circuit Judge being of a contrary opinion, that part of the
claim was rejected Both Judges agreed that the mining title

claimed under the proceedings before the Alcalde, was legal
and sufficiently proved, and it was accordingly confirmed- with
seven pertinencies each of two hundred varas square to be laid
out in such manner as the claimants might elect, but so that the
original mouth of the mine should be within them.
From the decree of the District Court both parties appealed
to this Court.
Mr. Archibald C. Peachy, of California, Mr. Charles O' Conor, of
New York, and Ar. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, for claimant.
In November, 1845, Andres Castillero, a Mexican military officer,
whilst journeying through California toward Sutter's Fort, on a
public mission, discovered in a spur of the Sierra Azul or Blue
Mountains, seventeen hundred feet above sea-level, the quicksilver mine now in question. The place had previously attracted
attention. Openings had been made by the Indians and by the
early white settlers. But it was Castillero "who first found
metal in it;" and, therefore, by the express words of the Mexican
law, he is "held as the first discoverer." Ord. of 1783, tit. 6, Art.
7, Halleck's Collection, p. 225. Nor has any rival yet appeared;
so his merit in this respect is unquestionable. He forthwith
reported the fact to A. M. Pico, the nearest Alcalde, who gave
him juridical possession "according the laws," as it was expressed, referring to "the Ordinance on Mining." Castillero
and his assigns, now known as the New Almaden Company,
have had possession and worked the mine ever since. At the
cost of a million of dollars they have fully developed the pro.
duct. Great benefit has thence resulted to the gold and silverbearing regions of North America. Until this discovery they
were mainly dependent on Old Spain for quicksilver, the very
life-spring of their industry. They are now aifiply provided
with that indispensable material from a home-source at less
than one-third of the former cost.

winter and spring of 1845-6. These facts were officially communicated to the State Department by our consul at Monterey
early in -May, 1846. They were published in the Sandwich
Island newspaper in July of that year, and were, soon afterwards, reproduced in the public journals of the Mexican capital.
Lured by the reputed richness of the mine, two sets of speculators from the Atlantic States respectively purchased neigh.
boring unsurveyed far.ms or ranches, soon after the acquisition
of California, each hoping to procure such a judicial survey as
would bring the mine within their boundaries. Berreyesas Case,
(23 How. 499;) Fossat's Case, (20 How. 413, and 21 How. 445.)
The claim now before the Court is indebted to this circumstance
for the attempt to question its validity.
Castillero's title was derived from the Mexican G6vernment;
3ut, by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, dated Februar# 2,
1848, our Government solemnly pledged itself that "property
of every kind" so held should "be inviolably respected.'. See
Treaty, (9 Statutes, p. 929, Art. 8.) The Act of Congress, passed
March 3, 1851, (9 Statutes, 631,) required all such titles to be
established before certain commissioners, subject to an appeal
to the District Court, and an ultimate appeal to this high tribunal. If a design to confiscate private property in 'violation of
the tieaty could be imagined, the pure and lofty tone of the 11th
section would at once repel the idea. It provides that "in
deciding upon the validity of every claim," the tribunals'are to
be governed by that treaty, "the law of nations, the laws, usages
and customs of the Government from which the claim is derived,
the principles of equity and the (prior) decisions" of this Court,
"so far as they are applicable." The decisions thus referred to
are those "in relation to titles in Louisiana and Florida which
were derived from the French or Spanish authorities previously
to the cession" of those States. Fremont's Case, (17 How. 553.)
The most enlightened and liberal equity pervades that series of
decisions. No honest claimant could desire that his title should
be tested by a higher or purer standard. In one of them, U. S.
vs. KingslZy, (12 Pbters, 485,) the Court repudiates the narr6w
iules of the common law." saying, that "it has not applied nor

will it apply" them. In the same. case, at p. 484, it is admitted
that "the United States succeeds to all the equitable obliga.
tions" of the former government; and that the Court in constru.
ing its grants must be governed by its supposable motives and
policy in making them and securing them by treaty. In Fossat's
Case, (21 How. 451,) the same doctrine is thus emphatically
declared :" The United States -did not appear in the Courts as-a
contentious litigant, but as a great nation, acknowledging their
obligation to recognize as valid every authentic title, and soliciting exact information to direct their Executive Government to
comply with that obligation."
The law officers of the Government in resisting this claim, do
not seem to have acted upon such principles or to have acknowledged the influence of such motives. Their course in relation
to this controversy entitles it to a place among the "causes
c~l~bres" of the age. Castillero's claim was presented to the
Land Commissioners in December, 1852. Strict and formal proof
having been insisted upon, their decision was not rendered until
January, 1856. The District Court pronounced its judgment in
January, 1861, and the case is tow here for final adjudication.
Castillero's title was twofold.
Under laws which, with occasional modal variations, had
existed for. centuries, and were in force in California when we
acquired that country, any person discovering a mine, whether
in public or private land, was rewarded with a perpetual pro.
perty therein and ownership thereof, and of an easily ascertain.
able amount of surface, immediately above the mine, called
pertenencias or mining spaces. The fact of discovery was to be
represented to the proper local authority, and that tribunal was
required to register it, to perform certain other acts, and to give
the discoverer immediate possession. In this case, all these
things were done. Exactly in what way, and with how near an
approach, in point of form, to the precision of a Coke or a Chitty,
we may speak if we shall happen to hear any intelligible exceptions to the mode adopted.
A very productive quicksilver mine, such as this was believed
to be at the outset and has proven to be, was a desideratum of

the very highest importance to Mexico. That metal is "sparingly
distributed in nature, and its mines are very rare." Ure's Dict.
"Mercury." The Royal mines of Almaden, in Old Spain, laving
but one even tolerably formidable rival, had supplied the world
wvith it for twenty-five centuries. Though of prime utility for
scientific purposes, and in a very few of the arts, its chief consumption results from its use in separating gold and silver fr6m
their crude ores. 5 New Am. Cycl., titles "Cinnabar," "Almaden ;"
Ure's Dict. "Mercury;" 1 McCulloch's Geog. Diet. "Almaden."
Vast quantities are thus employed; a pound of quicksilver is
usually consumed for every pound of the precious metals produced by mining. When the gold and silver ores are poor, that
is to say, when they produce a low percentage of the metal, the
consumption of quicksilver is proportionably increased. 'The
Mexican ores are poor; and, consequently quicksilver was much
in demand. Prior to Castillero's discovery the Juntade Fomento
or National Board for the Encouragement of Mining, sustained
by special taxes and imposts and other legislation, was constantly engaged in strenuous efforts to obtain it at home, and
thus to lessen the dependence on a foreign source. This depen.
dence was felt to be a grievous burden. In fact it was so; for,
in and prior to 1845, the date of Castillero's discovery, threefourths of the annual supply was obtained by importation from
Old Spain. By the Mexican law of May 24, 1843, numeous
exemptions and privileges were enacted in favor of 'quicksilver
mining. It "granted a premium of $25,000, to each one of the
first four operators who should [shall] extract in one year from
the mines of the Republic, 2000 quintals of liquid quicksilver."
It further decreed that $5 should "be paid for the term of three
years for each quintal of quicksilver" so produced. Halleck's
Collection, p. 453, arts. 4, 5. During and prior to 1843 and
1844, the National Junta commissioned experts for the purpose
and prosecuted laborious and costly but essentially fruitless
explorations f:r this mineral. Every department of the Republic was thus examined except, indeed, California. That remote
and thinly peopled region, says Mr. Negrete, a witness of high
intelligence, was regarded as "the *end of the world2' Trans

suspected until 1848. See Soule, Gihon & Nisbet's Annals of
San Francisco, p. 130; Transc. pp. 2680, 3052.
In the rude and experimental way which was alone practi.
cable, Castillero took immediate measures to work the mine.:
and, in March, 1846, he sent a messenger to the authorities at
the city of Mexico with specimens of the ore, and announcing
his discovery. Soon afterwards he followed in person. During
the first week of May in that year, he appeared before the Junta,
and, orally as well as in writing, he laid before that body an
application for aid in his enterprize. On his first communica-•
tion, and prior to his arrival, proper assays had been made and
the remarkable richness of the ore ascertained. The facts were
officially communicated by the Junta to the appropriate department. The Minister laid them before Paredes, who was then
President, and, as such, exercising extraordinary powers. Acts
of State, dated May 20th and 23d, 1846, recorded in the public
archives of Mexic6, copies of which have been exhibited, show
that the possession which Castillero had received from the local
magistrate was confirmed by the Government, and that two
square leagues of land around the mine were also granted him
by the President, in order to provide a supply of fuel for his
works.
On these documents, and proof of the connected facts, the
Commissioners held that the land-grant had not been perfected;
but they confirmed the claim to the mine with a pertenencia of
three thousand varas in every direction from the mouth of
the mine. This was an extra-sized pertenencia, and was equal
in extent to about two-thirds of the land claimed under
the two-league grant. The District Court also confirmed the
mining title, but with only seven ordinary or regular pertenenoias, comprising about fifty acres of surface. This was, in
point of law, the true extent of the mining title; so far as it
depended on mere discovery and the act of the local magistrate.
Judge Hoffman was'of opinion that the'two-league grant was
valid and perfect; but, on this point, the Circuit Judge con
curred with the Commissioners.

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

(The question whether a mining title was "land" within. the
meaning of the Act of 1851, and, therefore, cognizable in this
proceeding, gave rise to considerable discussion in the tribunals
below, and the point was argued at length here. The Court
having affirmed the jurisdiction, the points and arguments on
this head are omitted.)
The resistance to this claim, before the Commissioners, was
conductel in a very adverse spirit. But the controversy ws
confined to points of law. No doubt as to any matter of fact
was suggested until the summer of 1857. At that time, the New
Almaden Company had been about twelve years in actual ant
notorious possession and engaged in producing the mineral.
During most of the time, they had costly and extensive works
m full operation, and were supplying the whole country with
quicksilver. They had never been disturbed or interrupted in
the exercise of their dominion as owners. For eight or nine
years they had been engaged in active litigation with the speculators before alluded to, who had bought interests in the neighboring unsurveyed ranches, and who are known in this Court as
the Berreyesa and Fossat claimants. More than a year had
elapsed since the decision of the Commissioners; but, as yet,
the reputation of Castillero was untouched. No one had ever
suggested a doubt concerning the genuineness of his documents.
ais honor knew no stain. Edmund Randolph, sinde deceased
but at that time private counsel of the Fossat claimants, was
now (1857) introduced as a nominal advocate for the Government. Having assumed control of .the opposition he, at once,
put in issue the verity nf every thing alleged on behalf of Castillero. He deniefl every asserted act in pais and every record
or other paper produced to support the claim. From this point,
fraud, forgery, ante-dating,-indeed the whole circle of imputation, loudly promulgated by counsel, though supported by no
scrap or shadow of any thing which common sense could recognize as evidence,-has rung in our ears, filled the papers, ard
formed the staple of the contention. This new line of prn-cedure
has its inception in the record at page 165, or perhaps 252. Its
date is the srmmer of 1857. Thenceforth, the opposition to Cas-

tillero's title wore an attitude as contentious, and maintained a
course of forensic practice as rigorously disputatious as has ever
been exhibited by any private litigant, or been permitted in a
Court of Justice. The stream of contention rolled onward and
abroad, in all conceivable directions, until, at the end of 2652
additional pages of testimony, its power of expansion was at last
exhausted. The practice pursued would be amusing, but for the
time and money lost in contending with it, the temporary.doubts
excited for the moment by some single detached portion of the
testimony it elicited, and its offensiveness to honor and delicacy.
Permanent mischief it could never do in any tribunal that was
animated by a sense of justice and capable of distinguishing
between right and wrong.
The Alcalde's act of juridical possession was first assailed.
The original documents were brought in again by the government counsel, from the Recorder's Office, for critical scrutiny.
Witnesses were examined as to every handwriting in them, as
to the blots or accidental ink-marks upon them, as to the watermarks of the paper on which they were written, and as to the
manner in which the several sheets of paper were attached.
Transc., pp. 253, 264, 673 to 675. But this display was altogether nude and empty. Nothing resulted from the scrutiny or
has ever been claimed as a fruit of it. Surmises of forgery and
ante-dating were put forth upon the appearance of every discrepancy, however slight and palpably accidental, between any
of the numerous copies which had been made from time to time.
And every similar incident was, in like manner, harped upon.
These crude imaginations formed the basis of all the cavils
concerning this part of the claimant's proof. We have displayed
their insignificance with appropriate minuteness of detail in our
printed Claimant's Brief, pp. 42 to 98. We rely upon that
statement. It will appear to be faultless, unless precision be an
offence, or treating the work as necessary can be deemed a want
of courtesy to this Court.
Next the Mexican Documents were alleged to be posterior
fabrications. The mode adopted to support this allegation was
characteristic.

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
The most conspimous witness for the Government is one
James A. Forbes. He had resided near the mine -for about
seventeen years previously to Castillero's discovery. He was
neither a kinsman nor connection of Alexander Forbes, of Tepic,
who afterwards became a principal owner of the mine, and a
leading participant in working it. James A. Forbes took a smal]
interest in it at an early period; and he was, for a time, employed
as superintendent. This employment brought him into correspondence with Alexander Forbes and the firm of Barron, Forbes
& Co., merchants at Tepic, who had control of the mining operations. Prior to the summer of 1857, when Mr. Randolph thus
set about drawing in doubt the fairness of Castillero's title, this
James A. Forbes had become a bankrupt in character and foltune. On the trial ten witnesses impeached him as unworthy of
credit; and not one witness could be found to hazard a word in
his favor. Bolton, Barron & Co., of San Francisco, the agents
of the New Almaden Company, had refused to lend him money;
he was, therefore, on ill terms with them. Laurencel, owner of
half the Fossat claim, and the client of Mr. Randolph, gave this
desperate man $10,000 for the use of certain letters which he had
received from his employers, and certain alleged copies of his
own letters to them. This correspondence was to be used only
in exciting apprehension and inducing a compromise. James A.
Forbes expressly stipulated with Laurencel that he should not
be called as a witness, and that his letters should not be produced
in Court as evidence. They were according shown to the agent
of the New Almaden Company. He treated them with con.
tempt, and disdainfully spurned the attempt at intimidation.
Laurencel then produced the papers as evidence; and, in con.
sideration of an additional $10,000, James A. Forbes came
into Court and testified to their genuineness.
A paper, purporting to be a copy of a letter from Alexander
Forbes to this James A. Forbes, dated March 28th, 1848, was produced by James A. Forbes, more than half a year sabsequently
to his first examination. The claimant insists that this was itself
a forgery. The whole story concerning it is a singular specimen of plagiarism in pejury. It is incredible in itself; and it

reproduces, as if in a moral photograph, all the features of a
fable, sworn to a few years previously, on a somewhat famous
trial at Cooperstown, in central New York. There is reason to
believe that some actors in that very case have an agency in this.
One Eldridge, who appears on the record as Laurencel's partner,
owning the other half of the Fossat Ranch, came from that very
part of New York. (The argument to this point is omitted.
The counsel for the Government did not urge that this paper
was genuine; nor did the Court, in its opinion, rely upon it.)
Aside from that palpably fabricated paper, the purport of the
alleged correspondence produced by James A. Forbes may be
thus summed up:
First. The same identical documentary evidence produced
before the Land Commissioners, and then and still relied upon
for proof of title in the claimant, existed from the beginning,
and no thought or suspicion that any part of it was fraudulent,
forged, or ante-dated, had ever entered the mind of any one.
Secondly. On comparing Castillero's documents with his own
notions of Mexican law, James A. Forbes formed the opinion
that in strictness of legal construction, they were technically
defective, precisely in the particulars since urged against them
in this case. Hymann'vs. Cook, (2 Denio, 203.)
Thirdly. After the American possession of California, James
A. Forbes, pertinaciously, and for a considerable period, urged
Alexander Forbes, or Barron, Forbes & Co., to obtain from the
Mexican aathorities new documents of the same dates, and to
the same substantial purport as those already existing, but so
worded as to be free from those supposed technical defects or
blemishes. Ie pointed out these defects, and explained them
with great particularity.
Fourthly. To the manifest vexation of James A. Forbes, the
thing so advised by him was not done. The letters so state,
and the documents in the record prove it. These documents
are now produced by the claimant, and relied upon by him and
his assou ates as the basis of their title. They exhibit upon
their faces al the real or imaginary defects and blemishes mentioned by James A. Forbes, and urged by him as inducements

for their suppression, and for the substitution of ante-dated
forgeries. The correspondence thus identifies the title-papers
now relied upon by the claimant, and verifies their genuineness,
both as to tenor and as to dates. Instead of impeaching the
claim, this correspondence conclusively repels the suggestion of
any actual forgery or ante-dating. If the correspondence fails
to show that these fraudulent suggestions were promptly met by
a stern rebuke-if they justify an 'inference that the seducer's
unworthy proposition was for a moment entertained-it would
be quite immaterial in point of law. U. S. vs. West's heirs, (22
How., 318.) It should not be overlooked, however, that prudence and the desire "to conciliate a troublesome person" may
have dictated the style of reply. Transe. p. 398. And it is
entirely impossible to conclude from these letters, either alone
or coupled with any other proof in the record, that to any
extent, or in any degree a fraud, an ante-dating, or a forgery,
was actually perpetrated. In common fairness, the design should
not be imputed to any one save the vile instrument of oar
opponents, James A. Forbes. At least one of the alleged copies
first produced by James A. Forbes was a manifest fabrication
It is dated October 28th, 1849. Transc. p. 392. The claimant
subsequently produced the true original letter of that date.
Transc. pp. 844, 846. But the summary now given is accurate,
whether this false pretended copy be received into the series or
rejected. Arid it results that there is absolutely no evidence of
any sort in this record, impeaching any of the claimants 'docu
ments, or throwing the slightest doubt upon any of his allegations. Every one of those allegations is sustained by testimony
altogether free from doubt, aind so abundant in quantity that it
might well be censured as excessive.
Every witness produced for the claimant, who gave testimony
concerning any document or paper which such witness wrote
or signed, or of which he had any cotemporary knowledge, testified, in effect; that to the best of his knowledge, information,
and belief the same was not ante-dated, but was really and truly
made according to its purport. No witness produced for the
Government testified otherwise except one. This was Benito

Diaz. Transc. p. 676. This man was the copyist of a single
very unimportant paper. Indeed it was wholly useless. Closely
scrutinized, his obscure testimony, if taken for truth, gives but
the very faintest support to the charge of ante-dating. But, on
his own showing, he is an habitual prevaricator. His well-known
worthlessness is certified in the record. Transc. p. 3477.
Not a single witness produced for the claim is in the slightest
degree impeached. On the other hand, but three witnesses were
called by its opponents on any point connected with the merits;
that is to say, James Alexander Forbes, Robert Birnie and Benito
Diaz. Every one of these men was shown to be utterly unworthy of credit. If the fabricated paper of March 28, 1848, had
been abandoned at an earlier period, the impeachment of James
A. Forbes and Birnie would have been an act of wanton cruelty.
In all other respects, their testimony tended to verify the claim.
Judges McAllister and Hoffman separately examined the
charges of forgery and ante-dating. Their opinions show that the
task was performed w-ith great care and with close attention to the
most trifling minutia. Indeed, for the purposes of their scrutiny, they seem to have improved upon every imaginary scruple
touching the verity of the claimant's proofs. They elevated to
the dignity of a substantial charge every hint of a possible
doubt, yet they concurred in rejecting, as wholly unfounded, all
these charges, scruples and hints.
The impediments encountered by the claimant in producing
testimony should not be passed unnoticed.
Through some inadvertence the Act of Congress made no
provision for issuing a commission; and the Mexican Government does not permit its great seal to be used for the authentication of copies from its public archives. The law officers of
the United States, availing themselves of these circumstances,
successfully opposed the claimant's prayer for a commission.
They then opposed, and, by their influence, defeated an appeal
made to Congress .for an amendment of the Act in this respect.
Though the claimant offered to pay all the expense, they declined to employ an agent or agents to visit Mexico, there to
examine the archives and investigate the facts. They also pro-

cured an order from the Department of State, forbidding our
diplomatic and consular representatives in Mexico even to take
ex parte depositions for the claimant under the general law
allowing such proceedings as a common privilege. Every
means that the most illiberal policy could devise or that could
be dictated by a total blindness to common justice, was put in
force to embarrass and defeat the claimant's efforts to examine
witnesses residing in that country and to obtain documentary
evidence from foreign public archives. These impediments did
not avail to suppress all means of vindicating the claimant's
integrity. 'Nine witnesses, who, as officers of the Republic, had
officiated in the various stages of the transactions in question at
the city of Mexico, were brought to San Francisco and there
examined and cross-examined. By their testimony the Mexican
archives were directly and fully verified. Among these witnesses were two ministers of State.. One of them had been a
public officer in various stations for thirty years. He had been
twice Prime Minister, and for years Minister resident near the
Governments of Great Britain and the United States. They
were both men of the highest respectability. Two members of the
Junta.or National Mining Board, were produced and also several
clerks in, the public departments. The National Archives were
searched, and copious extracts were taken from them and
exhibited: in proof. These extracts Contained not only the'evidence of Castillero's proceedings in the city of Mexico and the
action of the Executive thereon, but also a multitude of extrinsic
transactions, with their dates and the names of numerous actors
therein. The most perfect means of testing their verity were
thus afforded; indeed, it seems idle to speak on this subject.
The evidence is all in one direction; it is overwhelming in
quantity and unexceptionable in quality. It is wholly uncontradicted and wholly unimpeached.
It only remains to inquire whether the facts, as alleged by the
claimant, create a title legal or equitable under the laws and
usages of .Mexico. By the Spanish laws, which were adopted
in the Mexican Republic, and were in full force whdn the United
States acquired Cilifornia, mines did not pass under agricultural

or other ordinary grants. By a general grant or concession they
were assigned, in absolute property, to any person who woldd
discover and work them. 1 Heathfield's Gamboa, pp. 136-7--8;
Ord. of 1783, tit. 5; tit. 6, art. 14, Halleck's Collection, p. 222,
228. See more ancient laws: Halleck's Collection, pp. 6 to 15,
17 to 61, 69 to 123; Law of Mexican Congress, Oct. 7, 1823,
Halleck's Collection, p. 403, 404. The ancient ordinances prescribe certain forms. The discoverer is directed to make a
written statement of the discovery toga local tribunal; that is tW
say, the mining deputation of the territorio. This paper is to be
returned to the party for his protection, after the deputation has
noted in its book of registry the time of its presentation. Within
ninety days thereafter, the vein is to be opened and a pit formed.
One of the mining deputation, that is, one of the Judges of the
Court, is then personally to visit it; and, says the ordinance,
"possession shall immediately be given, measuring to [the discoverer] his pertenencias," causing him to mark his boundaries
by stakes, and giving him a copy of the proceedings. Provision
is made for affixing notices; and if, within the ninety days, any
one should present a better claim, a summary hearing is to be
had, and the mine adjudged to him. Ord. 1783, tit. 6, Arts. 4,5.
Halleck, p. 224. These forms were substantially observed with
one exception. The pertenencias were not measured; and, of
course, no stakes were set up. This omission was quite immaterial. The pertenencia is an easily ascertainable space of land,
measured upon the surface. The ordinance gives the rule of
admeasurement in the most precise terms. Ord. 1783. tit. 8,
Halleck's Coll., p. 235. The number of pertenencias to which
Castillero was entitled, was in like manner ascertainable; it was
seven. Id cerium est quod cerium reddi potest. Ord. of 1783, tit. 6,
Art. 1; tit. 11, art. 2, Halleck's Coll., pp. 223. 252.
It is quite clear that this mere piece of surveying might be
deferred without serious ill consequence to the discoverer until
the interest of other persons should induce them to quicken the
miner. The Ordinance of 1584, arts. 22 to 31, Halleck's Coll.,
p. 78, was never repealed.. Its 24th article gave a summary
process for compelling any discoverer who should neglect that

precaution, to set up his stakes. Halleck's Collection, p. 80;
Hleathfield's Gamboa, p. 297. And the Ordinance- of 1783, expressly provides, that if a miner have no neighbors, (i.e. adjacent
miners,) or can do it without injury to them, he may change the
boundaries of hisertenencias at any time after they have been
measured off to him, and may alter the location of his stakes
accordingly. Tit. 8, art. 11, Halleck's Collection, p. 236. This
mine was in an uninhabited, mountainous region, far distal,.
from neighbors of any kind. Nearly a11 the Mexican 'grants
which have been allowed in this Court were, as in our common
law talk we express it, merely inchoate for want of a survey
and for the omission to obtain juridical possession. Our Courts
readily supply this merely formal defect. It is far easier td
measure to the New Almaden Company their*seven pertenencias
than to locate most of the agricultural grants which this Cou't
has confirmed. Indeed, it is the simplest and easiest open tion in surveying that can be imagined.
Surely the bookbinder's argument, that the Alcalde's stitcbhc d
record is not a book, will not avail. Besides, it.is an universad
rule, that omissions by a public officer in the mode of compl ring with forms prescribed to him as his duty, are not permittue d
to affect the party.
The jurisdiction of the Alcalde is unquestionable.
L There never was a mining deputation in California; and,
by the common law of Spain and Mexico, the ju4i.'ial powers
of all special jurisdictions, in their default or non-existence,
devolve upon the ordinary tribunals. Salgado's Retencion de
Bulas, Part 2, ch.. 12, No. 53, and onward; Agustin Barbsa's
Dommentario, ch. 5; Castillo's Controversias, tom. 6, ch. 146;
Pena y Pena's Practica Forense Mexicana, tom. 2, pp. 53, 371, 421.
It is proven by several uncontradicted witndsses, that
throughout the Republic of Mexico the practice has long conformed to this rule. In States, Departments, or Territories,
which had'no established- mining tribunals located within their
limits, registries and denouncements of mines were always made
before the Judges of first instance or before the Alcaldes acting
as such. Transc., pp. 29, 30, 133, 135 to 140.

II. By the Ordinance of 1783, tit. 6, art. 4, Halleck's Coll., p.
224, the proceedings are to be taken before the Mining Deputation of the "territorio or the one nearest ifthere should be none
there." And it is contended, that Castillero should have gone
to the nearest of the far off Mexican States in which a mining
deputation could be found. This is tuite a frivolous exception.
The whole frame of the ordinance shows that the word territorio,
in this place, is equivalent to city, town, or village, in our
phraseology. It means a small mining district, tofn, or place.
Within the time prescribed by the law itself, it was utterly
impossible to have gone to the distant State to which such a
construction would have directed Castil]ero. Neither could
the judges of such remote tribunal perform any of the duties
enjoined as to giving notice, hearing objections, visiting the
mine, or giving. possession, Ord. of 1783, tit. 6, arts. 4, 5. See
also, titles 1, 2 and 3.Halleck's Coll., 224, 193 to 220.
III. The fact of a meritorious discovery vested Castillero with a
perfect and unimpeachable title in equity, independently of
forms; consequently his claim was binding upon the Mexican
government in honor and conscience. Besides, he made a bona
fide effort to comply with all the prescribed regulations. And
if there be any defect in this respect, it must be admitted that
his acts were the closest approximation to exact and literal corn
pliance that was possible under-existing circumstances. When
these forms were .prescribed their main object, and indeed it
would seem that their sole object, was to secure the collection
of a tax or royalty upon mineral production which was then
reserved to the crown. Heathfield's Gamboa, p. 143. At that
time quicksilver was a royal monopoly. But in 1811, that monopoly was surrendered; and in 1823, as has already been shown,
all taxi and imposts on that branch of mining were abolished

In their stead, premiums and rewards, payable from the public
treasury to stimulate its production, were substituted. Decree of
Cortes, January 26, 1811, Halleck's Collection, pp. 381 to 385;
Act of Mexican Congress, Oct. 7, 1823 ; fb. 403, 404; Decree of
Dec. 2, 1842, art. 10, ib. 437; Decree of May 24, 1843, ib. 452,
453. Since quicksilver mines were placed on this favored foot.
ing, these forms had no object except benefit lo the discoverer
himaself. And when, as in this case, there were no neighboring
mines, they became almost if not absolutely unimportant.
IV. The action of the Supreme Government obviated the
defects, if any there were, in the Alcalde's proceedings. It confirmed Castillero's title to the mine itself and was a direct and
effectual grant to Castillero of two square leagues, his mind
being the centre thereof. It may be admitted that the latter
concession could not take effect on any lands except such as
may ultimately appear to have then been ungranted portions of
the public domain. The Government had no power or intention to give lands which had been previously granted to others,
.nor does the New Almaden Company claim any such lands.
1. During Spanish rule the Viceroy had power to extend
special and unusual privileges to meritorious mining enterprizes, by enlargement of the ipertenenias and otherwise. Ord.
of 1783, tit. 6, art. 15 and 17; ft., tit. 11, art. 1; Halleck's collection, pp. 2.9, 252; Lare's Derecho Administrativo, pp. 91,
93. Since Mexican independence, this power has- been vested
in the President.
2. As to grants of land, the rule was the same. In testing
their validity, this Court holds that the colonization law of
August, 18th, 1824, is the guide; 20 How., 63; 1 Black, 553.
The Californias were a territory, and the 16th section of that
law plabed the public lands in the territories, at the disposition
of the executive.
Acting 3inder this authority thus conferred on him, the
President of Mexico, by the regulations of November 21st.

subordinate agents, "some general rules" for their government

and their final action was subject to the approval of the local
legislative assembly. These regulations reserved an appeal to
the President himself in case of disagreement between the
Governor and the local legislature. In all cases the ultimate
power was with the President. It is objected that the grant to
Castillero" was not made in the manner prescribed by these
regulations. That is true; but it is quite immaterial. The
regulations were "dictated" by the President to control others,
his own subordinates. They did not bind him. In a case precisely analogous, this Court said: "It is apparent that these
general .regulations were intended for the government of subordinate officers, not to control and-limit the power of the
person from whose will they emanated;" Delazssu vs. U. S., (9th
Peters, 135.) Besides, at the time of this ratification and grant,
President Paredes exercised all the powers of government.
There was no written constitution; there was no legislative
body in being, nor was there any existing law whereby a legis.
lature could thereafter come into being. For this purpose, and
for administering the government in the interim, there could be
no resort, except to the extraordinary powers then exercised by
Paredes. We do not claim for him powers absolutely despotic,
in the extreme sense of the term. But it seems clear that all
acts of his administration whigh were performed in good faitb,
were just and reasonable in themselves, and were conformable
to the established policy of the Republic, should be held valid
as between the government and private individuals, whether
the precise methods of procedure prescribed by previous laws
were observed or not.
Castillero, through the mining Junta, stated to the President
his discovery and that the local authorities had given him
possession of the mine with at least twice as much surface asthat inferior tribunal had authority to give. As the Junta
understood and construed-the Alcalde's act, fifteen perteneneias
.had been granted. Castillero represented "to the Supreme
Government the'necessity of its approving the possession"so
given, and "the advantage of there being granted to him, as a
colonist, two square leagues upon the land of his mining posses-

sion, with the object of enabling him to use the wood for his
burnings ;" Transc. p. 1802. The President's afiswer was given
upon the margin of the application, in these words: "fMay 20,
1846. Granted in the terms which -are proposed; and with
respect to the land, let the corresponding order issue to -the
Minister of Relations for the proper measures of his office, with
)he understanding that the Supreme Government accedes to the

petition." Transo. p. 1798. Three days afterwards that minister delivered 'to Castillero a dispatch addressed to the
Governor of Californias, transcribing the decision of the piesident on "the petition of Mr.Castillero, to which his Excellency,
the President, has been pleased to accede, that there should be
granted to him as a colonist two square leagues of land upon
the land of his miniag possession, so that in accordance with
what is provided in the laws and dispositions upon the subject
of colonization, you (the Governor) may place Mr. Castillero in
possession of the two leagues referred to." Transc. pp. 2200,
and 1807.
Writing the word "granted" on the foot or margin of a peiition, was the common method of making an absolute cession of
lands in Spanish America; and this Court has often decided,
that, in p6int of form, it is quite sufficient. "It must be referred
to everything referred to in the petition." Smithb vs. U. S.
(10 Peters, 332; 23 How., 498; 18 How.,'563.)
The mining possession was ratified unequivocally. Among
the things sanctioned was a loan of money to Castillero, to be
repaid in quicksilver from this mine, and to be secured by a
mortgage on the mine. The two leagues of land were conceded by a grant in prmsenti. The words cannot be otherwise
construed. It has been said that it was merely a reference of
the petition to the Governor, to the end that he should act
upon it conformably to the regulations of 1828. This is not'
according to the words; and it is quite irrational. When the
President 'ays, 'Igrant his petition," can he mean I give him
leave to petition my subordinate? That was the common right
of everjjboly. But the notion is baseless. The regulations
were iot applicable. They refer exclusively to a differbnt duo

of applicants; that is to say, those "who may ask for" lands
"for the purpose of cultivating or inhabiting them." Hardly
one of their details, is, in any degree, adapted to this transaction, or capable of being moulded to fit it. See these regula.
tions. They are to be found in Ex. Doe. of 31st Congress, 1st
Sess., No. 18, pp. 88 to 40. To say that the Governor was
directed to proceed according to the regulationswould be absolutely. absurd. It was impossible to do so. They did not
apply. The 16th section of the law of 1824 was alone applicable; it, authorized the President to grant lands in the territories. The governor had only to .give juridical possession
which was the civil law livery of seisin. This was a mere
formality; and he was the proper local officer to. give it, or to
cause it to be given. The omission of such forms has alwayn
been disregarded by this Court. 17 How., 563 ; 18 How., 6, 7,

In the bulk of the record, and the magnitude of the interests
at stake, this is probably the heaviest case ever heard before a
judicial tribunal. Firmly believing it to be illegal and fraudulent, the United States have always met the claim with uncompromising hostility. From first to last they have shown it
nothing but the edge of the naked knife.
But the character of this opposition is complained of as being
ijnfair. Specific accusations are made, intended and well calculated to produce the impression that the claimants have been
hard y, if not wrongly dealt with. "Now mark how a plain
tale will put that down."
The claimants were unwilling to produce their witnesses at

San Francisco, as the law required. They desired to examine
them in Mexico, where the United States could not follow them.
The District Court refused them a commission for that purpose.
They appealed to Congress for a change in the ]aw, and Con
gress refused to make any change. Thereupon they asked the
Attorney-General to consent, in violation of the law as ex
pounded by the Court, and adhered to by Congress, that depositions should be taken in Mexico. This he declined to do.
because (among many other reasons,) there was no fund upon
which he could draw for the expenses of counsel, to represeni
the.United States in a foreign country. Then it was that they
proposed-yes, openly and plainly and boldly proposed-to
pay all expenses themselves; to take the counsel of both sidesunder their own pay. This proposal was of course rejected with
the indignation and scorn it deserved. And the claimants were
notified that from that time forth"they must keep their distance.
But th. did not end the struggle they made to %void ro
ducing their witnesses where the law required them to be, and
where the proper officer of the government could be present to
cross-examine. They gave notice that depositions would be
taken in Mexi~o any how. Our consul at the City of Mexico
and the Minister Plenipotentiary were to be used for doing that
which the judiciary, the legislature, and %e executive, had
declared to be unlawful and improper. The Secretary of State
instructed our diplomatic and consular officers not to prostitute
their functions by allowing themselves to be used in any such
way.
What was meant by this effort m the face of all law to get
Mexican depositions which they must have known could not be
read,-for the Court had previously so decided,-remains a
zaystery yet. We know the case was not made out by the
eVidence which was afterwards legally taken; but we do not
know what they might have got Mexican witnesses to testify in
ex parte affidavits. We know from the record that a title
dated previous to the war was asserted and sworn to by them,
or some of their agents,-and that title is now wholly abandoned as a thing which never existed.-but it is not*certain

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres -Castillero.
-that somebody else might not have sworn to it also, if the
testimony had been taken where no punishment could be
inflicted upon perjury, and no cross-examination could expose
its character. They may have the admission as frankly as they
wish it, that we never trusted them; and this want of confidence
is abundantly justified by the evidence on record. The men
who had avowed in their own letters to one another, their intention to forge a title for the property in contest, and to retain
possession of it "at all costs, and at every hazard," are not the
persons who can excite sympathy, or place themselves in the
interesting predicament of injured and ill-used gentlemen, by
showing that the government doubted their integrity, and
refused them unlawful opportunities to consummate the fraud
they were known to be contemplating.
The claimants assert two titles :-1. The first is called their
mining title, which on its face is a grant to Don Andres Castillero, by. Antonio -Maria Pico, Alcalde of San Jose, dated
December 30, 1845, for three thousand varas in every direction
from the mouth of the mine. This would make a square measuring six thousand varas on each of its sides-about a league
and a quarter of land, with the mine in the centre. 2. The
.other title paper is a dispatch dated at the City of Mexico,
20th May, 1846, signed by Castillo y Llanzas, Minister of Relations, addressed to the Governor of California, and requesting
him to put Don Andres Castillero in possession of two leagues
on-his mining possession, in conformity with the colonization
laws. The claimants insist that this is a grant for two leagues
with the mouth of the mine in the centre of it also; that is to
say, a grant of the same league and a quarter given by the
Alcalde in December, and three-quarters of a league more.
This enormous claim is founded upon these two papers alone.
The bloated body of the claimants' case is made up of evidence,
oral and written, which is meant to show that these papers are
genuine, and that a right to the land in question passed into
Castillero when they were made, and by virtue of their legal
operation.
The United States object to the Llanzas dispatch that it is

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

The United States vs. Andres Castillero..

without show or semblance of legal validity, as a grant of land,
because1. The Political Chief of the Territory alone is authorized
by the Mexican law to divide the public domain among colonists.
The decree of 1824 and the regulations of 1828, limit the power
and control its exercise.
2. If the Supreme Government has the power it must be exercised by its responsible head. The Minister of Relations cannot
do it of his -own will; and there is no evidence here that the
President of the Republic authorized his act.
8. This dispatch of the minister does not purport to be a
grant. It is a simple request that !he political chief will exe.
cute the colonization laws in such manner that Castillero may
acquire a title in accordance with those laws to two leagues of
land not designated or described. The dispatch itself,by every
rational construction of it, required the Governor to receive a
petition and a map designating the land; to inquire what public
interests and what private rights would be affected by the grant;
and to decide, after a full hearing of all concerned, whether a
title to Castillero could be properly made or not. Castillero took
the paper and the Governor never saw it. If it had been presented to the Governor he could not, and the presumption must
be, that he would not, have made a title to this land, because the
first step of the investigation which the law bound him to make
would have shown that it had been granted long before to other
parties.
4. If the Governor had actually made a grant for the land
now claimed under the dispatch, it would still be a conclusive
and unanswerable objection to it, that it was at that time private
property. The fact is proved by the record and not denied by
any body, that Larios and Berreyesa had titles, under which they
were in possession for many years. Could the Government oi
any officer of the Government take away their rights and vest
them in Castillero ? No; even a despot cannot do that without
breaking up the foundations of society. It is the crime for
which Ahab's family was doomed to be extinguished and his
wife eaten by the dogs. It is not less an offence against Mexican

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres (Jastillero.
than it is against American law. The proof is conclusive, that
Castillero knew this to be private property. If he concealed the
fact from the officer, then he was trying to cheat the Government and his neighbor both. If he communicated it, and the
officer attempted to make a title notwithstanding, then the two
were engaged in a base conspiracy to cheat. Either way it is
as corrupt in morals and as void in law as the nalkpest forgery
which he could have made with his own hand.
5. But if we concede that the Minister of Relations had power
to make a grant of these two leagues, and that he did exercise
the power by issuing this dispatch; admitting, in short, that the
paper is a valid and good title on its face, still the fraud committed by Castillero, in his written representations to the Govern:
ment, would render it utterly null and void. In his memopial
to the Junta de fineria he describes the mine as being in the
mission of Santa Clara, which is public land. In truth, it was
on private property, near the line between Berreyesa's ranch
and that of Larios, fifteen miles away from the Mission ldnds.
And he cannot deny that he kne-w this very well, for his other
title, dated four months earlier, describes the mine as being on
the ranch of Berreyesa.
6. There is another fatal objection to this title paper. It is
dated 20th of May, 1846, after the declaration of war by the
UniLed States against Mexico, which event took place on the
13th of May. When the treaty of peace was under negotiation,
Mi. Trist, the American Commissioner, proposed to insert a pro
vision that all titles made subsequent to 13th of May, 1846.
should be void. The Mexican Commissioners declared it to b-3
unnecessary, and assured him in the most solemn manner, and
after more than one examination of the record, that no titles for
land in California had been made after that date. On this basis
the treaty, was agreed to, with that declaration repeated in the
tenth article; and when the ratifications were exchanged, Messrs.
Clifford and Sevier . assured the Mexican Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, that all titles dated before the 13th of May would be
protected. On these facts we maintain that the validity of the
claimant's title was tried and determined and pronounced by

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castilero.
the Mexican Government itself to be no title at all. From the.
treaty, the dispatches of Mr. Trist, the protocol appended, and
the correspondence of Mr. Clifford, while Minister, no other
inference can possibly be made than one of these two: either
this dispatch of Lauzas was not then on record, and is therefore a subsequent fabrication; or else it was adjudged by all
the chief officers of the Supreme Government to be totally destitute of, that legal validity which would bind either Mexico or
the United States to regard it as a title to land.
7. This title is not only repudiated by Mexico, but the parties who claim under it have themselves deniedI its value as a
legal title under circumstances which give that denial the..
greatest weight. Their correspondence concerning it is on this
record. Their own letters admit that they cannot hold the land
under it; and they were so entirely sure of this that they agreed
to procure another and a different title to be forged, and use
that forgery in place of this. Common charity will require us
to suppose that these men would not have determined to contmit a great offence against God and man without perceiving the
clearest necessity for it. We cannot suppose that they -were
impelled by the mere love of crime for its own sake. •
The other branch 6f, the case-that which the claimants call
their denouncement or mining title-is perhaps more impor
tant; certainly some parts of it are less simple and less easily
disposed of.
It is admitt6d that a mining right may be acquired under
flie laws of Spain and Spanish America by one man upon the
lands of another; but he acquires no title thereby to the land
itself. The mines are public property and the Sovereign can exercise the right of eminent domain by taking so much private
property for that public use as may be necessary to work them,
providing that just compe-catinn be made to the owner. The
laws of Spain and Mexico embody on this subject precisely the
principles of our own State and Federal Constitutions. The
delegation to an individual of this right of eminent domaindomin'o alto-so that he may work the public mines, constitutes
the substance of a Spanish mining title But a miner has uo

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
more title to the land under whibh the mineral lies, nor to the
mineral itself, than a turnpike company in this country has to
the soil on which its road is laid. (Yide. Gamboa, chap. 2.) We
submit, therefore, that the Land Commission had no jurisdiction
of this case, since its power is limited to the investigation of
titles to land only.
But we put this point to the Court merely because we cannot
be' faithful to our convictions without doing so. We shall be
glad to find it decided the other way, for that is not our defence
against this claim. We oppose it for these two substantial and
powerful reasoils: 1. That it is not on its face a mining title;
and, 2. That the evidence shows it to be spurious and fabricated.
The assertion that this is not a mining title according to the
law of Mexico, does not mean merely that it is informal, irregular, or defective in some particulars. It is unlike the title required by the plainly written statute in form and substance; in
every feature of its form, and in !1 parts of its substance; all
through, from beginning to end, it not only disobeys but insults
the law. It is a contradiction and a violation of the ordinance
in the aggregate and in the detail; in its general aspect and in
all its lineaments; in the sum total and in every item by which
the sum total is made up Let us see what the law is, and then
compare this pretended title with its provisions.
Three distinguished counsellors engaged in this cause for the
claimants have written books on Spanish and Mexican Mining
law-Messrs. Rockwell, Halleck and Benjamin. We make no
accusation against them of wilful bad faith, but we deny thei
authority on the points disputed here, and we do not happen to
need their help. Heathfield has given us a faithful version of
Gamboa's great work, and Thompson has translated the ordinances in a manner never complained of. Both those gentlemen
were eminent English lawyers and accomplished scholars in the
Spanish language. Their books were printed for public information, and were not suggested by the wants of any particular
case. He who studies this subject impartially, with these lights
tq guide him, will hardly go wrong. But it may aid the inves.
tigatio to look at the legislation of other countries. Mines are

regarded as public property and worked under public authority in nearly all the countries of continental Europe. The
general principles of every code are the same as those on which
the Spanish system is founded. There is no subject on which
the laws of so many governments are so nearly alike. We refer
the Court to Peyrrett-Lallier-Legisationdes Mines; .Blavir-,
Jurisprude&ce des Mines en Allemagne; Delabecue-Legislation
des Mines, en France et. Belgique. The last book, besides full

commentaries on the mining codes of France and Belgium" contains an account of the laws on the same subject established in
Bohemia, (88); Saxony, (48); Austria, (47); Hungary, (45);
Prussia,(62)" Hanover, (56); Sweden, (104.) The' Repertoire

des Mines furnishes the Ordinances of Sardinia in Italian and
French.
If there be any one proposition more clearly undeniable than
another, it is this: *That no man can or ever could acquire a
mining title in Mexico without a registry by the proper public
authorities. Such is the high and unquestioned authority of
Gamboa, who- devotes Chap. V., of his Commentaries to the task
of proving that registry is the very basis'and foundation of the
miner's right, and that it would be unsafe, unwise and unjust to
dispense with it in ay case. The ordinances, themselves, com.
mand it in express and unquivocal words. It is a principle of
public law that every act of a public officer under which a
private right is claimed must be made matter of record. Every
mining code in the world so far as we know requires it. All
writers, great and small, concur in the opinion that there can be
no pretence of title without it.
What is a registry? That is easily answered. We need not
resort to translators. The word is the same in Spanish and in
English. Both derive it from the Latin-liber rerum gestarum
-which the Roman lawyers contracted into registrum. To
register a thing is to write it in a book; and this, Gamboa says,
is especially required in the case of a mining title to preserve
it from the danger of simulation, defacement, fraud and loss to
which separate papers would be exposed.
Here mo registry is proved or even alleged. It follows irresia-

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
tibly that the claimants have no color of title. That ought to
be an end of the case, and it would be the end of any case
except this.
But they produce three or four loose papers which they call
"the Espediente of a Denouncement." The very use of this phrase
shows that they have no title; for a title approximating in form
or substance to that which the law requires can have no denouncement nor no espediente about it.
A denouncement, denuncida, is the delation or accusation
which one who desires to rehabilitate an old mine makes of the
default which the former owner has committed and by which
the previous title has been lost. The ordinances employ it in
this sense; the legislators and authors use it so; it is so defined
by Escriche, the standard lexicographer of the Spanish law. It
has no proper application to any thing connected with the title
of a new mine. As signifying the representation of a discoveror,
it has been introduced into California parlance for the benefit
of this case, and it is countenanced by a note to Mr. Rockwell's
book; but such use of it is against all authority.
The word espediente has long been familiar here. It is the
junction of all the seiarate papers made in the course of any
one proceeding, and which remains in the office at the close of
it. (See Escriche in voc.) But in a mining title there are no
separate papers. The first representation with which the miner
presents himself before the Deputation is returned to him after
its substance is transferred to the registry. The registry, pure
and simple, constitutes not only a necessary part but the whole
of the title, the beginning, middle and end of it. No one can
read the ordinance and fail to see that the assertion of an espediente contradicts the assertion of a legal title.
But let that pass. What did Castillero do to give him or his
grattees a decent pretext for claiming the mine? He came to
California in the autumn of 1845, and went to New Helvetia.
He left SutTer's fort on the 12th of November for Santa Clara.
From the latter place on the 22d of November, he addressed a
letter to the Alcalde of San Jos6 declaring that he had dis,.over.d a vein of silver and gold (which was false) on the

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States'vs. Andres Castillero.
Rancho of Berreyesa, (but he does not say where,) and requesting tha i.idces be put up which never were put up. On the,
1st of December, at Santa Clara, he detected the presence of
quicksIver in the ore as testified by Lease, and on the next day
wrote again to the Alcalde that on opening the mine he had
taken out besides silver, with a ley of gold, liquid quicksilver in the
presence of several bystanders. All this was false, he had not
opened the mine and there was neither gold, silver nor liquid
quicksilver there. Soon afterwards he got one Chard to reduce
some very small quantities of the ore by heating it in gun barrels.
While this was going on the Alcalde and some other peisons
came to the mine, and they swear that possession was given of
it that day. But Chard, the only witness free from the suspicion of being professional, swears that Castillero was not there
to receive the possession. Castillero left for Mexico in March,
and never returned. Chard worked on a while with gun barrels
and afterwards with trypots, but in August he suddenly dropped
the business and went away salivated. It is not pretended that
any more work was done until the spring afterwards, when Wal.
kinshaw and Alden came up, and it is not proved that they did
any. But Alexander Forbes came up from Tepic in November,
1847, discovered the mine, which, until then had been undiscovered, ascertained the extent and direction of the vein and the
richness of the ore, and in January, 1848, he began to work it,
and simultaneously to fabricate titles for it with false certificates.
These are the res gestw as proved, not by the liber rerum
gestarum, but by loose papers and oral testimony. Taken collectively or separately, is there any thing in them (the documents or the facts) which looks like a mining title? Analyse
the Ordinance of 1783 from which this title derives its life, if it
has life, and compare its provisions with the acts of Castillero
and Pico. The requirements of that law are plainly these:
"1. The grantee of the right must have discovered the mine.
"2. He must present himself before the mining deputation of the
territory or distrit, or if there be none-therp, before the nearest
one.
"8. lIe must preset to the deputation a written statement,

exhibiting his own name and the names of his pa tners, thei_
residence, profession, "&c.
"4. The statement must also contain a description of the place
where the mine is, embracing the most particularand distinguishing
features of the sitio, (spot,) sierra,(mobntain,) or cirta, (vein.)
"5. All these things shall be entered on a book of registry,to be
kept by the deputation,.and the written statement shall be handed
back with an attestation upon it for the due security of the discoverer.
"6. Ni'ewly days' notice shall then be given to the public of the
application which the discoverer has made.
"7. Within the ninety days he must dig a pit in the vein, one
yard and a half in width and ten yards deep.
"8. A member of the mining deputation must then go personally
accompanied by the secretary,if there be one-if not, by two assisting witnesses, and by the mining professor of the district, to inspect
the mine.
"9. He must ascertain the course and direction of the vein, its
width, its inclination to the horizon, its hardness, or softness, the
solidity of its sides, and the kind of mineral it contains, and al'
these things must be carefully noted and added to the -registry.
"10. The evidence that possession was given must also be
inserted in the registry.
"11. Possession must be accompanied by a measurement of his
pertenencia,and by fixing stakes to show the boundaries."
Every one of these provisions was based upon principles of
public policy, which experience had proved to be not only sound
but necessary. and every one of them was disregarded in the
present case. Castillero was not the discoverer of the mine; he
knew no more about it than what was known to the Indians for
a hundred years before he came there. He did not present him
self before the mining deputation of the tbrritory, or take the
legal alternative of going to the nearest, but wrote to an officer
who had no authority. 'He furnished no designation or descrip.
tion of the mine, by which it could afterwards be knownm, nor
did he disclose the names of his partners. There was no registry made, nor no notice given to the public; no inspection, nor

no opening to be inpected; no assignment of pertinencias; no
measurement or marking of the ground.
"Here then, is a title-if it be a title-made in
1845, to a mine
that was not discovered until 1848; made by an officer, who had
no jurisdiction, to a company that is not named; without designating the subject-matter of the grant by even the vaguest
description; without a registry, without notice, without inspection, without survey or stakes. To call this a title according to
the laws, usages, and customs of Mexico, may pass in California,
where so many curious things are done; but before the supreme
tribunal of the Union, it would be absurd to fear it. Kncwing
it to be impossible that you can pronounce this a title, it is
allowable to say, that such a decision, if it were made here, would
provoke the loud laugh of the whole world.
It is worth a moment's time to-observe how these fatal defectt
in the title were treated by the Court below. One of the judges
passed them over in profound silence, as not thinking it necessary to determine whether the claim was founded on a legal
title or not. The other judge examined the documents elaborately, and thoroughly analyzed the ordinances. Of course, he
saw that the objections of the United States were well founded
in point of fact. But it was his opinion, that Castillero had a
title Z'y discovery, which was not forfeited by his acts in violation
of the ordinance, or by his omissions to do what the ordinahce
required. This, we submit, was in the very teeth of both the fact
and the law; of the plainly-frovedfact that Castillero never discovered the mine, and of the plainly-w-dtten law that the title of
a discoverer is absolutely nothing without a registry and mark
ing of boundaries. It was never asserted that Castillero had for
feited his right: he never had any right which could be forfeited.
It is true, however, that if a title had vested in him it would
have been forfeited. Neither he nor his alienees ever paid into
the public treasury a cent of th' share to which it was entitled
from the proceeds of the mine. Besides, the mine was never
really worked until 1848, more than two years after the date of
the pretended title. It is not asserted that any thing at all was
done 'atit,even with gun-barrels or trypots, from August, 1846,

until late in the spring of 1847. Now, it is expressly provided
by the ordinance, that if the owner of a mining title shall suspend the working of the mine for four months within the space
of one year, his title is absolutely and completely gone; any
other person may register it, and the original owner cannot lawfully work it again without getting a new title, by means of a
new registry. If, therefore, it were conceded that Castillero got
a perfect title, by the act of Pico, in December, 1845, it is never
theless clear, that when Barron, Forbes & Co. took possession in
1848, they were mere naked trespassers, without color or shadow
of right to the property at which they were grasping.
But they say their mining title was confirmed. That is
impossible; for a mere nullity is incapable of confirmation.
Besides, the mining title was never exhibited to the Supreme
Government. Castillero vaguely and falsely referred not to this
mine, but to a mine which he had denounced in the Mission of
Santa Clara. Neither the President nor any of his ministers
knew the situation of the mine, or saw any papers relating to it.
Nor did either of them say a word about the title in any official
act, order, or decree.
Another objection to the mining title, equally formidable and
equally clear, is that the evidence shows it to be spurious, fabricated, and false. Many grounds of strong suspicion may be
seen on the face of the papers.
-1. The want of a registry can hardly be accounted for with
out believing that the papers were made after the conques
Castillero had the ordinances, and knew that a registry was
required, and would have had one if he had been getting a title
in 1845. But in 1848 it was a difficult thing to make a book
and put it among the records.
2. This proceeding appears to have been closed up on the
30th of December, 1845, thirty-eight days after the date of Castillero's first representation to the Alcalde. He could not but
know that the law required him to wait ninety ddys. The
Alcalde knew it, and recites in the "Act of Possession" that the
time.has expired. There is no fact proved, or suggested, which
cwn account for this illegal and unnecessary haste op the the9y

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

115

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

that the papers are genuine. But if they are false, it is easily
understood. Antonio Pico must sign, for nobody else would do
it, and the last paper must, therefore, be dated when he was
still in office. Ie went out of office December 31, 1845. The
"Act of Possession" is dated the dxy previous. The other papers
had to be dated after Castillero came into the country, and this
is the reason why the whole proceeding appears on its face to
have been crowded into the space of thiity-eight days.
8. The papers are all in the handwriting of different persons,
Castanada, Benito Diaz, and Gutierrez. None of them was
written by the claimant, by the Alcalde, by the Secretary, or by
either of the attesting witnesses.. None of the persons who
wrote them is called, except Diaz. and he swears that his share
of the work was done long after the intended date of the papers.
We cannot assert that the character of this witness is perfedt,
but it is as good as that of Castro by whom he is contradicted.
4. But there is another circumstance here, whic6 is more
than a ground of mere suspicion-it is perfectly conclusive.
The "writing of partnership," which is part of their espediente,
and the sole foundation of title to twelve out of the _fwenty-four
,iaras,describes the mine as a mine of gold, silver, and quicksilver,
and is dated on the 2d of November, 1845; when it is abso.utel r certain that no human being had.ever thought of such a
thing as quicksilver being there. The very moment when 'the
presence of quicksilver was first detected in the ore is ascer
taned beyond dispute from the evidence produced by the claimants themselves; and they admit here, that no idea of such a
thing existed earlier than the last of November or first of December. The counsel not only admit that fact, but they admit
our inference from it 4hat the paper is ante-dated. Though this

conclusion was successfully resisted in the Court below, it would
be mere vanity to deny it here. These chronological blunders
are the besetting dangers of men who make false papers. They
often occur in fabricated titles, and when they do occur, they
always furnish the means of most triumphant exposure. May
years ago a Spanish grant of land in -Louisiana was discovered
to .be a forgery by an officer in the Land Department, wbu

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
noticed that Bayou Mason was referred to in one of the papers,
which bore date before the time when that bayou was known
by that name. In the case of Lady Ives, a long chain of titlepapers, ingeniously fabricated, was totally destroyed, by showing that one of the deeds, dated in the reign of William and
Mary, ascribed to the king and queen a style or title which was
not adopted until after the date of the deed. It was only at the
last term that this Court pronounced the claim of Jos6 Castro
to be fraudulent, mainly upon the ground, that in the grant Pio
Pico was made to call himself ConstitutionalGovernor,whereas
at the date of the grant he was First Vocal and Governor ad
Interim, and did not become Constitutional Governor for several
days afterwards. In none of these cases was the proof of fraudulent ante-dating one whit stronger than it is here; and the
proofs which sweep the writing of partnership away- carry wit'i
them the other papers also ; for it is so important a part of tb
title, and is so connected with all the other papers that they
must suffer a common doom.
What evidence have they produced to authenticate their espe
diente? If it be genuine it was archived at the time it was
made; it was deposited among the records of the Alcalde's
Court with the superscription of the proper officer on it; it
remained there until the time of the conquest; it was then
delivered to the authorities of the United States, and has been
an-American record ever since. If this were its history it would
prove itself; for record evidence, if it be truly such, is always
simple and conclusive. It would have needed no bolstering
by the oaths of the officers who signed it, nor no false certificates
from their successors. The claimants could and would have
gone to the records at once, in the beginning of the contest, and
by merelr producing it, would have silenced all denial of its
truth. Instead of this they resorted to copies, now known to be
false, and did not produce what they alleged to be the original
until eleven years from the time of its pretended date. Conscious that it was not a record, they resorted to evidence in pais
to show the execution of the several papers, and to establish the
facts which they set forth. Let us see how they have succeeded

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

117

The- United States vs. Andres Castillero.

in doing this; aud what proof they have given that the papers
were either mad,-or filed and archived, at the time of their date.
Of the two petitions, which are part of the espediente, it is a
remarkable fact, that not a scintilla of evidence is given. Even
the Alcalde, to whom they are addressed, does not say that he
ever saw them. Pico, Noriega, and Sufiol testify that they
signed the Act of Possession, but not that it was filed or ordered
to be filed. It was brought to them ready written by Gutierrez,
who took it away again. None of these men swears fo any act
connected with the paper which might not have been done by a
prvate individual as easily as by an officer, and after the conquest as well as before. Fernandez, the Secretary, says, Guttierrez brought it to him, but he did not file it; he only saw it there,
tumbling about among other loose papers. Under the pressure
of a strong cross-examinati 6 n, the truth oozed out of this witness, drop by drop. He admitted at last, that he never read it,
did not know it, and had only sworn to its identity because he
imagined it to be the same. That is the evidence of its being
filed among the archives; the imagination of one false witness,
too treacherous or too timid to carry -out the purpose with
vrich he began.
There is not on the paper the slightest mark that it ever was
seen by any Mexican oicer before the conquest. But another
paper is produced-an inventory signed by Chaboya, sec6nd
Alcalde for the next year; in which among other documents is.
mentioned "Acta de Possession de Mina de St Clara a Don Andres Cattillero.". This does not speak of the espediente,but only
of oneyaper, and does not identify even that.
They have introduced another set of facts, which are not evidence, and which it is scarcely possible to speak of with
patience. Castillero was one of the most mendacious of human
beings. He wrote and spoke every variety of falsehood about
the mine, the work done at it, and his right to it. And these
false statements of his own are produced at second, third, or
fourth hand, as proof of his title-witnesses detailing his words
or the words of somebody else, who had heard him speak-letters
,from himself.-letters from others who repeated his state.

ments-newspapers in the City of Mexico-newspapers in the
Sandwich Islands, detailing a story which the editor got' from
Judd, and Judd got from Larkin,. and Larkin got from Castillero ;-all this is paraded as evidence of title. We deny that
the mere repetition of Castillero's falsehoods, by other persons,
is any evidence of their truth. Nay, the production of them in
Court is a plain palpable badge of fraud. No honest claimant,
with an honest title, would think of going to the Sandwich
Tslands for hearsay evidence to prove it. The experience of
this Court may be safely appealed to for that. No case was
ever confirmed here that had any thing like this on its record.
But every false and dishonest claim comes loaded down with
this kind of trash Miserable must be the condition of a country
where such testimony is not only brought out and listened to,
and debated at the bar, but where grave judges sit gravely on
the bench and discuss it in their written opinions. On this side
of the Rocky Mountains no justice of the peace would give judgment upon it for the price of a sheep, but in California it is
allowed to swing a court from its moorings in a case involving
uncounted millions of dollars. It is one of the saddest tales of
these sad times, that men's rights should be so trifled with in a
court of justice.
The claimants have produced four different espedientes. One
of these they allege to be the original from the record of the
Alcalde's Court, and to it the evidence already mentioned
applies. The other three profess to be copies. But the three
copies differ from each other, and each copy differs- from the
original in material and most important respects. These flat
contradictions, apparent on the face -of the several titles produced at different times by the claimants, are so numerous that
it has been thought best to exhibit them in a kind of tabu~ir
form, arid therefore a chari of them is inserted in the brief of the
United States. This enables the Court to seeo at a glance the
decisive evidence that all of them arefalse.
No. 1, the " Weekes' espediente" -is certified to be a true copy
from the original by James Weekes, Alcalde of San Jos6, 20th of
January 1848. It was written out by James Alexander Forbes.

DECEMTMER TERM, 1862.

119

The UniWd Ses vs. Andres Castillero.

one of the claimants, at the instance of Alexander Forbes, another
claimant. There was no original in the office. Weekes certainly signed the certificate without seeing any. original; and
he hinself afterwards swore to that fact. James Alexander
Forbes, being British vice-consul for California, certified under
his official seal, that Weekes' attestation was "worthy of all
-oredit," and then gave back the document to his confederate,
Alexander Forbes, who took it to Tepic, where he got the addi
zional certiflcates of several Mexican officers and the American
consul. This false paper, thus falsely certified, was filed in the
Land Commission, as the basis of the claimants' title, and the
decree of the Land Commission was founded upon that gross
imposture. After the cause came into the District Court, it was
exploded, and the claimants found it necessary to take new
ground.
No. 2, the HallecPs espediente, is the one which Captain (now
General) Halleck testified in 1857, that he had found among the
records of the Alcalde's Court at the Mayor's Office, in January,
1851. This is the original if there be any original. Mr. Halleck does nt speak with certainty of its being the same paper
but only to the best of his knowledge and belief from the
contents and general appearance. But he regards this as the
originaldenouncement of the mine, and says he has not, and never
had, any reason to believe that it was in Mexico or elsewhere
out of its proper place among the archives. General Halleck
was mistaken-possibly about the identity of the paper-certainly in the judgment he formed that it was an old record-as
the following facts clearly show:
It seems there was an ejectment pending in 1850, between
the Berreyesas and the New Almaden Company for the mine
and adjacent land. The Court made an order upon the defendants (the present claimants) to produce their title papers, or
a copy thereof; Mr. Halleck, their attorney, answered it by an
affidavit, declaring that the order could not be complied with;
that is to say, they could not produce the original papers, or
any copies thereof, though all due diligence had been used, beu9 use the title p apers were in Mfexico, and among others partieu-

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
larly specified is this very paper, the original denouncement of
the mine.
If this affidavit is believed, it puts beyond controversy the
fact that this espediente was not among the archives in December, 1850, and proves conclusively that it had not been there a
month when General Halleck found it. And who shall dare to
deny the truth of the affidavit? Will the claimants attempt to.
sacrifice upon the altar of the false god they worship the character of a man who has served them so faithfully, by asserting the
want of all truth in a statement to which he pledged his oath
for their benefit?
The affidavit is true. It avers no falsehood and conceals
no mental reservation. General Halleck did use due diligence;
he looked for the papers in their proper place and did not find
them, because they were not there. We deny that he was capable of equivocating about two originals or paltering with the
Court in a double sense. Especially do we repel the imputation
which the unkind construction of the Court below would fasten
uion him, of taking the oath from his employers, and like the
lowest professional witness, swearing what they told him to
swear, without knowing or caring whether it was true or false.
The supposed contradiction between the affidavit of 1850 and
the deposition of 1857, amounts to very little, and. that little is
easily accounted for by lapse of memory and error of judgment. But there is enough in it to confirm the faith of the
Court in the wisdom of the rule which excludes oral evidence
altogether as a means of proving title. If General Halleck with
his unblemished character and high position is liable to mistakes, what can be the value of such witnesses as Pico, Noriega,
and Fernandez? "If the righteous scarcely be saved, where
shall the wicked and the ungodly appear?"
But the affidavit is true, and the espediente was therefore a
false and simulated record, not merely because General Halleck
has so sworn, but also because that oath of his is corroborated
by other evidence conclusive and irresistible.
Between the years 1846 and 1851, the title to this mine was
in constant dispute. Half ,, dozen suits were heard and deter.

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

mined by; the local courts, in which Castillero's right was asserted
on one side and denied on the other. Every body living near,
whether in public or private life, must have been excited and
interested in the clamorous controversy which was so long
and so fiercely carried on. Yet this espediente on which, if it
existed, all these contests must have turned, was found by no
officer, seen by no witness, and produced by no party. When
this is considered in connection with the fact that the records in
the Afealde's Court were very meagre and few-a list of them
does not cover half a sheet of foolscap-the non-existence of the
paper becomes as clear as any negative fact can be made by
judicial evidence.
But that is not all. The papers of the Alcalde were on two
occasions made to go through very narrow places, where only
one could pass at a time, and then under the inspection of vigi.
lant eyes. When the last Mexican Alcalde delivered the records
to the first American officer, a list of them was made out and
receipted for. This espediente was not on that list. Again, when
the State Constitution 'was established the Alcalde's office was
abolished, and the records previously kept there were distributed
ainong the new officers; some going to the Mayor of San Jos6,
some to the Clerk of the County Court, and some to the Recorder.
The officer who made this distribution and examined the papers,
one by one, for that purpose, swears that this espediente was not
there then. Can demonstration go further?
It may be added, that it could not have been among the
Alcalde's archives when Weekes signed the certificate for
Forbes in January, 1848. They were not guilty of a gratuitous
fraud. They would not have got a false copy falsely certified
if a true copy with a true certificate could have been had as
easili, for they must have known that in such a case truth
would serve them, not only as well, but much bette: than falsehood.
The paper was produced in Court by Mr. Houghton the
Deputy Recorder, and is by him marked filed 25th February,
1853. which he swears he did at the request of James A. Forbes.
Capt. Halleck says that he and the Mayor, Mr. Belden, took it

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
to the office of the Recorder, who was then a Mr. Richardson.
Neither Belden nor Richardson have been sworn. But it i'
shown that on the back of the paper there is a note in pencil,
that it was filed by Richardson 21st January, 1851. How oi
when that note came upon the paper does not appear. It is
tolerably fair to infer that it was not there on the 25th of February,. 1853. Why would Mr. Houghton have marked it filed
on that day, if there was already on it a file mark of earlier
date? This pencil mark of Richardson is a mysterions but not
very important affair.
If the espediente went.to the Recorder's office in January, 1851,
it must have disappeared again soon afterwards. Houghton,
who had charge of the office did not see it there until February,
1853. In that month he was visited by James Alexander Forbes,
and requested to search for the record of Castillero's mining title
which was this paper, as described by Forbes with great ext --i.
ness. They searched diligently for more than one whole day'
without success. But after Forbes went away Houghton found
it when he was not looking for it; it turned up just under his
hand. There can be no reasonable doubt that Forbes, while
pretending to search for the paper had slipped it into a pigeonhole clandestinely. The letter of 1st of December, 1849, from
Alexander Forbes to James Alexander Forbes, shows how
highly the "well-known cleverness" of the latter gentleman at
such tricks was appreciated by his confederates.
Such is the Halleck Espediente-produced by the claimants
as the original record evidence of their mining title. There is
not a scintilla of legal evidence to sustain it. Apart from the
contradictions and falsehoods of the witnesses who swear to the
act of possession, this Court has many times decided that parol
evidence, for such a purpose, is inadmissible. The allegation
that it is a record, is not only unproved but is met by overwhelining proof to the contrary. Its history cannot be traced
back with any certainty further than February, 1853. It is
plain to demonstration, that it was fraudulently dropped among
the archives at some time not earlier than December, 1850.
No 3, the Fernandez espediente is so called merely because

it was introduced as an appendix to the deposition of that
witness, who swore that it was in the handwriting of Salvio
Pacheco. Pacheco being called, testified that he wrote it, but
did not say that it was a copy of any original. Chabolla, by
*hom it purports to be certified, under date of 13th of August,
1846, was asked no question concerning it. The introduction of
this document, as it was introduced, without the least proof to
sustain it, confirms the falsehood of the others, not only because
it differs from them, but because. the want of all evidence to
show what it was copied from makes the inference irresistible
that no original was in the -office when it was made. If it had
been truly copied in 1846 from an original record, which was
then in its proper place, it cannot for a moment be supposed
that the claimants would have failed to prove it by Pacheco and
Chabolla, who were both on the stand.
No. 4. The Walkinhaw espediente. It is scarcely credible, but
it is true, that, after these three failures, the claimants were bold
enough to produce a fourth espediente, differing from all the
preceding ones. It came from their own custody. They found
it, as they allege, among the papers of Walkinshaw, one of the
claimants, who had died; and it bore on its face the 6vidence
that it was mutilated. The testimony, by which they tried to
authenticate it, sets the fraudulent character of the claim in a
very strong light. The two petitions of Castillero are certified
by Chabolla as copies from the record, with date of January 18,
1846. To the act of possession there is no certificate at all;
probably because the certificate for that was torn off with the
writing of partnership which the heading shows to have been a
part of it, as originally made up. The espediente then, as produced, consisted of the two petitions, e~ach certified by Chabolla,
and an unuertified copy of the act of possession, with evident
marks that one or more subsequent papers had been detached
before it was brought into Court. Chabolla was called to prove
that the two petitions were truly copied at the date he certified.
He swore that he could scarcely read; that he could write
nothing but his name; that the papers were brought to him from
44 mine, and he signed them without knowing what was ia

The United States vs. Andres Castilero.
them; he never saw any originals; all he knows about them
now is that they are papers. This fraudulent imposture upon
the ignorance of Chabolla was practised by Guttierrez. The
espediente and certificates are all in the handwriting of that
infamous man; so is the ante-dated writing of partnership; and
so is most of the Halleck espediente.
But the "Act of Possession" was not certified as a copy, and sc
the claimants determined to prove it as an original. When Pico
Norriega and Suffol testified, several years before, to the Halleck
document, they swore to the making of only one act of possession. But in 1860, they supplemented that testimony as the
exigency of the case required, by swearing that two originals
were made, and that this Walkinshaw document was one of
them.

The Court below received this paper and treated it as genuine!
The contradiction of the witnesses by their own previous depositions; the admitted falsehood of Chabolla's certificates; the
mutilated condition of the paper itself; the difference between
this espediente and each of the three others, which the claimants
had before alleged to be true; none of these things seem to have
excited a suspicion in the minds of the judges unfavorable to
the claimants. The confiding simplicity of their faith is touching, but the example is not edifying.
Such are the four espedientes-the original and its threc
copies-destroying one another by self-contradiction; differing
by the absence from one of whole papers found in another;
differing in what purports t6 be the same papers; differing even
in matters so important as dates of time and place. *The original (the ifalleck) claims to have been archived at the time it was
made, but no official mark on its face or on its, back justifies the
assertion, and it is proved by the affidavit of the claimant's own
counsel, and by the uncontradicted testimony of other good witnesses, not to have been among the records for at least five
years after its date. Of the three pretended copies, one (the
Fernandez) is without any proof whatever, though the person
who wrote it with his own hand, was not only in full life, but
actually called as a witness by the claimants. The certificates

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
appended to the other two (the Weekes and the Walkinshaw)
are proved to be false by the very officers who made them.
All the known facts and circumstances connected with the
case, and the whole conduct of the original claimant, his asso.
ciates and grantees, are inconsistent with the belief that this
title or any part of it was made at the time it bears date.
Castillero went to Mexico in March, 1846. He had no papers
with him like those. He claimed that he had discovered and
denounced a mine in the Mission of Santa Clara, but he neither
mentioned nor showed such a title as this. When Mr. Negrete,
as agent of Forbes, began to bargain with him for the purchase
of shares, he was called on to show his title, and he showed
nothing but the "writing of partnership ;"-the paper now admitted to be ante-dated-and he did not allege that he had any
other title.
When he came to make a formal conveyance of the shares to
Forbes, and to recite -his title in the act of sale, he recited only
the writing of partnership. No other title is recited by him, or
by any of his grantees, in any of their numerous conveyances,
down to the year 1852, when references to the espediente first
begin to appear in their deeds.
The petition of Jos6 Castro, one of the socios, ignores this tith
for nine hundred pertenencias by asking for three more pertenencias in continuanceof the first.
When Ale~ander Forbes petitioned the Alcalde for four consecutive pertenencias, he certainly could not have intended to
claim under a .title which gave him nine hundred..
The effort of a party to get illegal evidence'into the case is
always a fair ground of something more than suspicion. These
claimants, besides their struggle for Mexican depositions and
their introduction of hearsay from the Sandwich'Islands, have
filled the record with mhtters not only irrelevant, but unauthor.
ized by the loosest rules practised in other cases. 17x uno disce
omnes: They caused the exparte affidavit of Alexander Forbes
to be taken at the Mansion House before the Lord Mayor of
London, introduced it into their case, and it actually comes here
as part of the record.

fail to make a profound impression upon the mind of the Court.
We refer to the various acts of fraud determined upon; attempted
and actually perpetrated by these claimants, or some of them.
The certificates appended to both branches of their title, as
filed in the Land Commission, were false, and known by the
claimants to be false. One was the Weekes' certificate, already
adverted to. The Lanzos dispatch was certified by Jesus Vejar,
a notary public at Tepic, in Mexico, who declared under his
official seal that the dispatch had been respected and obeyed by
the Mexican authorities that governed in Upper California in
1846, according to insertions which those authorities had made
in acts passed on the subjects of which they treat, which insertious, he, the notary, had seen. All this was false. The dispatch
never was in California until long after the Mexican authorities had been expelled, and, of course, the notary had seen no
acts of theirs on the subject. He says, in the certificate itself,
that he made it at the request of Barron, Forbes & Co.
That the "writing of partnership" is ante-dated has already
been mentioned as a material fact. View it now as a moral circumstance, affecting the status of the parties in Court. It is
their most important paper, if any one be more important than
another; and they themselves have always treated it so. The
first representation of Castillero to the Alcalde asserted the previous formation of the partnership. Possession was delivered
to the Company not to Castillero. The title to one-half the
barras at this moment depends upon the fact that the Socios had
an interest to thht extent in the mine by virtue of the previously
existing partnership;for they claim it on that ground alone. It
was, therefore, manifestly necessary for them to show that a
partnership had been formed before the other proceedings commenced. They could not prove this by parol, and did not
attempt it. They produced a written agreement of partnership,
dated to suit the purpose, and that agreement is now admitted to
be ante-dated. This paper they put into the first espediente they
produced, got it certified by an Alcalde to be "a true copy to
OJe letter" of an original in his office; filed it with the petition

as one of their muriments of title, and passed it on the Land
Commission as a genuine paper with a true date. In the District Court they adhered to it with the same inflexible pertinacity, stood over it steadily, resisted 'fiercely every attack whicb
went to impugn its absolute verity. The Judges were imposed
upon; they believed the paper to be truly dated, and found that.
as one of the facts upon which they based their decree. The
guilt of all this seems to us horridly aggravated by the consideration. that the evidence was, all the while, 'within their
immediate reach, by which they could have shown how, when,
and why the Paper was made, and fully explained the false
date, if it was capable of explanation. Gutierrez, who wrote
it; Arce, whc signed it as attorney for one of the parties, and
Manuel Castro, the Prefect before whom it was celebrated, were
all competent to testify, were all in full life, and none of them
was called; but Antonio Pico, the ever-ready and willing witness, was relied on to make the false date appear like a true
one. But now, the case being here on appeal, the counsel for
the claimants look carefully over the record, and with the frankness which might be expected from their high character, admit
in their briefs and in their arguments, that the evidence which
shows the paper to be ante-dated is too clear for contradiction.
Their candor explodes in a moment the imposture which the
claimants persisted in for ten long years.
Look at the letter from Alexander to James Alexander
Forbes, dated 1st of December, 1849. Nobody pretends that
more than one dispatch was ever issued by Lanzos, and that
was addressed to the Governor. But here another one, totally
different, and addressed to Castillero himself, is spoken of as
being in possession of the claimants. It must have been a
forgery. What is worse, the writer of the letter, after stating
the superior value of the forgery over the genui-ie document,
coolly suggests to his correspondent, that he withdraw the one
from the record and substitute the other in its place.
Upon these facts we put no harsher construction than the
Judges of the District Court did when they granted the injunction, as may be seen by their opinions, printed in McAllister')

Reports. But the view then taken was somehow overlooked
when they came to make the decision now under review.
The legal and just weight to which these fraudulent acts of
the claimants are entitled, would make them decisive against a
far better case than they have made out. The odium spoliatoris
is always a perfectly fair element in the judgment of a Court
He who spoils the evidence or perverts the means of ascertaining the truth, or otherwise poisons the stream of justice, especially if he does so by putting false papers into the case ceases
to stand on the same level with honest suitors. Common sense
applied to common affairs follows the same rule; a knave once
detected in trying to cheat you is never trusted again. It is a
maxim of the common law, as it was of the Roman law, and a
rule of logic which all experience proves to be sound, that qui
semel est malum, semper presumitur esse malus in eodem genere.
When, therefore, a fraud is discovered in one paper, all other
papers produced by the same party are presumed to be fraudu.
lent. This presumption is not slight or easily repelled. OMNIA
presmuntur contra s oliatorem-ALL things are to be presumed
against the spoiler-and we have a right to invoke the natural
indignation and anger which an honest man feels against those
who commit these base and mischievous crimes; for this pre.
hatred of the
sumption is made "in ODIUM spoliatoris"-in
spoiler. We have not overstated the rule. Every text book
on the law of evidence will bear us out. We may refer especially to Best on Presumptions, and the cases there cited.
But the portraits of these parties are painted by themselves,
and the picture they have drawn is a part of the record. The
letters they have written to one another describe their moral
character, and show that they were actually engaged for a long
time in using their best efforts to get false and fraudulent titles
fabricated for the mine and lands in dispute. When it is once
ascertained that a witness is capable of committing peijury, all
he swears to is rejected as false. In reason and in law the rale
is the same when a party is found to be capable of forgery:
the papers not known to be fabricated must sbare the fate. of
those, which are proved to be spurious; for every thing is cor.

rupt that comes from a corrupted source. Falsus in uno, fa'4
in omnibus.
The way in which these letters came out has been much commented upon. Their genuineness being admitted, it makes no
difference how the Government got possession of them. But it
was all perfectly natural. James Alexander Forbes was sore,
and perhaps malevolent towards his former confederateg in crime;
because he and his family had been deprived of all share in
that imperial fortune which was the fruit of their joint iniquity.
He had filed his mind for Banquo's issue. While he was contriving the fraud, and doing his full share in the execution of
it, they praised his "well known cleverness," counted on him
"as a friend," and told him that he was working for "his owni
interest" as well as theirs. But when the deed was done, he
was quietly dismissed to poverty and contempt.
Mr. Laurencel, a French gentleman, then residing in California, and Mr. Eldridge; had, or thought they had, an interest in
opposing the claim, and they devoted 'several years with. great
enetgy, skill, and ability to the sole business of exposing the
fraud. They knew that James Alexander Forbes had been in
active correspondence with the claimants at a most interesting
period in the history of their title, and they rightly conjectured
that the letters then written would throw a- flood of light on its
character. .They asked him to produce them, and when he was
tempted by a consideration his "poverty but not his will con
sented," so far as to let them be used for the sole purpose of
compelling a compromise. He did not dream that his former.
friends would continue to prosecute the claim, when threatened
with the infamy which the publication of such a correspondence
would produce. But the experiment appears not to hate been
tried. The District Attorney, learning that these letters were
deposited with a banker, subject to the joint order of Laurencel
and Forbes, issued a supcnc duces tecum, had them brought into
Court by the Marshal, and there the whole disgusting con
spiracy was laid bare.
The genuineness of these letters has never been seriously denied; the handwriting of the parties is clearly proved; !here is

not the least doubt of their authenticity. But there is one other
letter, not worse than these, which the claimants allege to be a
forgery. It purports to be a copy of one written by Alexander
Forbes, and it is a true copy, unless James Alexander F(ibes
and another witness named Birney, are both guilty of perjury
They have attacked the general character of these witnesses
under the circumstances that will not shake the faith of the
Court. The statement that the original was stolen out of a carpet
bag, at a hotel, without forcing the lock, either of the carpet bag'
or the room door, does not seem improbable, when we consider
the skill of thieves, and recollect that none but a thief of "wellknown. cleverness" would be employed for such a purpose. But
it is true that James Alexander Forbes was damaged on cross.
examination, and it is much against him, that he is not only a
Forbes, but admits his complicity in the guilt he charges upon
the others. The Court will decide whether these considerations
ae sufficient to reject that one letter, and if so, attention will be
confined to the others.
Those others are amply sufficient to show that the claimants
formed a conspiracy to commit the most stupendous fraud that
has ever been attempted against the United States, or any other
Government; that they deliberately resolved to get false papers
made at the City of Mexico, have them deposited among the
archives, and afterwards taken out and certified as genuine;
that these papers were to be made after the form furnished by
one of the parties, and approved by the rest, with boundaries
and dates agreed on; that two of the conspirators went to Mexico
for the purpose of carrying out the design; and that they had
every prospect of success. They did succeed, at least in a
measure, for there is one letter which shows that a forged disputch from the Minister of Relations was in the hands of tho
claimants, and sent to Cdlifornia to be used there. Besides, thr
affidavit of their attorney and agent, made in 1850, proves that
they then claimed under a grant which was certainly a forgery,
for it was dated before th' declaration of war, and it is not now pretended that a genuine grant of such date was, or coald have been
made. When these facts are considered in connection with the

other fact that both their titles, as actually filed, were coupled
with certificates from Weekes and Vejar known to be atrociously
false, the claim must be regarded as utterly corrupt. If such a
title could be sustained here, the courts of this country would
cease to be a terror to evil doers, or a praise unto them that
do well; virtue and vice would stand in equal favor, and all distinction between guilt and innocence would be wholly oblitetated.

which admits of no satisfactory, or even plausible, answer.

them to be genuine, and the acts of the Alcalde, supposing them

5. The non production of this title, for several years, and the
attempt to claim under a different title, are convincing proofs of
its non-existence then.
6. The silence of Castillero, and his grantees,. concerning it,
and the absence of all reference to it in their deeds and other
transactions show that it was neither made at the time of its
date, nor after wards used in good faith.
7. The numerous frauds of the claimants; their use for many
years of a paper now admitted to be ante-dated; the false certifi
cates of Weekes, Chabolla, and Vejar, made at their instance,
and uttered by them as true; the counterfeit dispatch from
Lanzas; the grant they asserted to be made before the declaration of war; the deliberate determination disclosed in their letters
to get other title papers fabricated; all this raises a powerful
presumption against the honesty of the claim, covers it witb
odium, and makes its rejection the unavoidable duty of the
Court.
Claimant's counsel, in reply.
The Court has heard a speech, teeming with impufations on
the claimant's good faith. Every fact asserted in his behalf has
been flatly denied. One of the counsel imputed fraud, forgery
subornation of witnesses, and consequent perjury. He has
unqualifiedly charged falsification of the public archives and
corruption of public officers of every grade, from the grave
ecclesiastic, who was Bishop of Puebla and a Minister of State,
down to the humble rustic who administered legal remedies as a
Justice of the Peace. It is difficult to meet these charges,
except by a rebuke uttered in such mild and decorous form as
may become the dignity of this place and presence; for there is
no proof in the record affording the slighest support to any of
them. Nor has either of the counsel distinctly presented even
an imaginary proof tending to any such inculpation. The
printed brief furnished us by the counsel for the Government

as the basis of their argument here and-as the evidence of their
preparatory research, does, iitd ed, 6tt odesigfte some
impeaching evidence. To o z perceptions it contains only
eight criticisms. We delivered to the counsel for the Government,before this argm'tnent commenced, a short printed note ou
each of them. By that note it was plainly shown that each of
these criticisms was founded on a total and perfectly palpable
mistake as to the actual contents of the record. That short
commentary on the Government's brief is before the Court. Its
effect was to prevent the only counsel who spoke to the facts,
from using his brief at all,or laying his finger upon any.one
definite charge indicating any one piece of inculpatory evidence
or, in fact, giving us anything definite to answer.
Perhaps this will not be considered a fair statement of our
adversaries' course. It is true that, in a loose and general way,
allusions have been made to some topics of impeachment. To
each of these we will give a distinct answer.
1. Castillero is charged with misrepresentation in his peition
to the Junta. His title to the two leagues of land and the ratification of his mining title are attempted to be impeal~ed on
this ground. Let us see with how much justice.
In a letter sent from Santa Clara to his friend, Ex-President
Herrera, he says "at a distance of five leagues from.this Mission
to the west,. [i. e., the Mission of Santa Clara,] I have discovered," &c., Transc. p. 1784. In his more formal petition to
the Junta, he says, "having discovered in the Mission of Santa
Clara," &c., Transc. p. 1800. Both of these statements were
true; for the mine was five leagues from the Mission iifage
called Santa Clara. And in common speech "the Mission" embraced a considerable'extent of territory. He did not mean that
his mine was within the village; nor could he have been so
understood. - In order to appreciate the folly or.presumption of
this charg. one must bear in mind, that both of these statements were laid'before the Junta; they were both presented by
the Junta to the Government. Surely there was no deception
in this (erbal difference.
1 2. To tie local magistrate, Castillero stated that the mine wab

on Berreyesas rancho. This statement is not repeated in the ap
plication to the Junta. The cause of the change is fully explained.
We have produced and proven, in Bereyesa's own handwriting,his false representation, that his ranch was two leagues
in extent. His heirs did not dare to produce in this Court the
alleged grant for two leagues of which he so furnished a copy
to Castillero. They only set up a grant fox one league: see their
case, 23 How. 500; Transcript, p. 2730, § 4, Ib. pp. 2728, 2741.
2735-2740. At first, Castiller acted on this misinformation;
but soon afterwards he discovered the fraud. Transe. pp. 559
560, § 4, pp. 543,441, 3049. Surely he was right in not repeating his mistake when addressing the Junta.
3. It is said that Castillero's mining title was not exhibited to
the Government. There is not the slightest proof of this; nor
is there any reason whatever to presume such a negative. The
suggestion is the merest subterfuge. In his petition he stated"I have denounced and taken possession not only of said mine,
but also of three thousand varas in all directions, and complied
with all the conditions of the ordinance." And in the 7th clause
he stated-" the necessity of [the Government] approving tht
possession, which has been given me of the mine by the local
authorities of California, in the same terms as those in which I
now hold it." Transc., pp. 56, 57. Surely here is the most dis.
tinct reference to the fact that he had this title. After being
thus notified of it, if the Government did not "see the papers, it
could only have so happened because they did not desire to see
them, and therefore did not call for them. Indeed, no man can
doubt but the' Government was bound, in honor, conscience, and
by its established policy, to confirm the mining title, even had
it been utterly destitute of form or technical regularity.
The Junta, in their representation to the Minister of Justice,
dated May 14, 1846, minutely discussed the legality of the "pos session given to said Castillero by the local authorities of California." Transc., p. 54. Is it not the height of folly to presume
that they did this wiihout having the papers before them?

produced and examined in California. Miranda and Yri
then clerks in the Ministry of Justice, were also produced. The
Government's counsel did not ask any of .these witnesses or any
one of the Mexican officials whether he saw the mining title at
the time in question. And suppose, through inadvertence, Cas.
tillero did not exhibit his mining title, what then? He talked
to the Junta of it; he wrote concerning it; but, not being asked
for it, he did not happen to show it. Where is the law or the
principle of equity which would make such an omission fatal, or
in any degree prejudicial to his claim?
IL On the 26th of May, 1848, the Commissioners who, on the
part of Mexico, negotiated the treaty, stated that "no grant of
lands" in California had "been made since May 13, 1846." This
statement is supposed to have some influence on the case. For
many reasons it is altogether without probative force-as mere
evidence of the fact it is wholly without weight. 1st. The Commissioners had no access to the National Archives, as the capital
and all the public documents were then in our military possession.
They could only speak from report of such clerks or former officials as happened to be within reach at the moment. 2dly. The
period referred to was two years distant, and the date of this
grant was but a single week later than the date mentioned.
3dly. According to any view the Commissioners could have had,
the &ant in question was most insignificant in extent and value,
and was most likely not to be remembered with precision as to
its date. It was a common practice to grant gratuitously eleven
leagues of good, level farming land to any one who would undertake to build a house and live upon the tract. This grant
embraced only two leagues and was on an uninhabitable moun.
tain. Mines, strictly speaking, were never granted. The mere
discovery was a meritorious basis of right. It gave an equitable
title, ipso facto. The forms of registry or confirmation, were
indeed necessary. But they could not be justlydenied to the
first discoverer, if,he merely asked for their observance. 4thly.
Certain other circumstances taken in consideration, this statement is quite destitute of force. Nearly all the grants of land in
California were made by the Governors and Departmental Assem.

blies withoat any intervention of the Supreme Government. It
was impossible that those Commissioners could have known
whether any such grant existed or how many of them had been
made subsequently to May 13, 1846. Several of later date have
been confirmed by this Court.
The instructions from the Department of State to Mr. Trist,
our Commissioner, mentioned May 13, 1846, as a fit date to be
suggested in the negotiations. It was the day on which Congress recognized the existence of war with Mexico. But no
importance was attached to the precise day. "If necessary," say
the instructions, "the date may be changed to the month of September, 1846, when the American forces took possession of California." Transc., pp. 2958, 2959. The discrepancy in date
:etween this grant and the 13th of May, 1846, is about a week.
History, the Act of Congress, and the proof in this case, all show
that ' the Americans took possession of California July 7, 1846,
yet here we find our Secretary of State, on the 15th of April,
1847, asserting that possession was not taken until some time in
September, 1846. This is a discrepancy of eight weeks 1 Was
that Department guilty of fraud and misrepresentation?
This declaration of the Mexican Commissioners certainly has
io legal or technical force. Our Government has denied it
-ecognition, as forming any part of the treaty; and it has been
entirely repudiated. It has been regarded, throughout, as a
thing of no validity. 31st Congress, 1st Sess., Senate Doe. No.
1, p. 84. The Act of Congress, under which this claim is made,

We cannot suppose that its genuineness is seriously disputed
yet, on this topic, a singular piece of captiousness is displayed.
lVejar, a notary at Tepic, in March, 1850, certified this to be an
authentic instrument; and, according to the custom of Spanish
notaries, he gave the knowledge on which his conclusion in favoi
of its authenticity was based. It was that it "has been respected
*and obeyed by the Mexican authorities that governed in Upper
California, A. D. 1846, according to insertiong which the said
authorities made of the said instrument in acts which they
passed." He adds, by way of emphasis, and, as it might be
thought, for a climax, that "Seor Don Andres Castillero recognised it." Transc, p. 68. This has been exclaimed against as
a false and fraudulent certificate. It is said this poor notary
meant to certify that he had been away off in the wilds of
California, and had there seen the Governor of California put
Castillero into possessiohi Could any- suggestion be more-frivolous? Hismeaning is evident. On December 17th, 1846; Castillero, at Tepic, the residence of this Mr. Vejar, by solemn act.

for working this mine. On that occasion this dispatch was produced, recognized as genuine by Fuentes, and inserted in his
official record. Fuentes being dead, Vejar, on the strength of
thatrecord, expressed the opinion in question. Transc., pp. 1195
-1203. This certificate never was or could have been used as
evidence. It never was so used; and, indeed, it is perfectly true.
2. Mr. Alexander Forbes, of Tepic, answering by letter, one
of the technical scruples suggested by James A. Forbes, states
that he had deposited, or registered at Monterey, a counterpart
of the land grant, which was directed to Castillero himself,
instead of being directed to the Governor. Transc., pp. 843, 396,

acts of Mr. Alexander Forbes in California, whilst testifying in

have deemed it. He testified- that he forebore to search from a

SUPREME COURT.

IV. The attack upon the claimant's title papers, connected
with the proceedings before the Alcalde, belongs to a school
happily heretofore unknown in legal practice.
A brief narrative of the facts deducible from the record
affords the readiest means of exhibiting the emptiness of this
assault.
Castillero first supposed he had disc6vered a mine of gold and
silver; he so represented to the Alcalde November 22d, 1845
Soon afterwards he ascertained the presence of quicksilver, and
he made his second representation to that effect on December
3d, 1845. The Alcalde visited the mine on the 30th of Decem.
ber, 1845, gave him possession, and executed in duplicate his
act of possession. One of these was deposited in the jusgado
or Alcalde's Court house, the other was returned to Castillero;
and, at its foot, he took the Alcalde's receipt for his fees. By
accident, the date "30th" was left blank in the duplicate which
remained with the Alcalde.
Sometime between the discovery of the- quicksilver, late in
November, and the 2d of December, 1845, Castillero fotmed a
partnership with Jos6 Castro, Real and the Robles for working
the mine. Doubtless the article of partnership was written in
November, and a blank left for the day; but it was not signed
antil December 2d. They then filled in that day, but neglected
to alter the month. By its terms, M. Castro, the Prefect, was to
furnish certified copies to the parties. He did so. His certifi.
cates of authentication all bear date on December 8th, 1845.
On 13th January, 1846, Castillero caused to be made a duplicate of each of his two petitions to the Alcalde Pico, and had
them certified by Pedro Chabolla who had succeeded Pico as
Alcalde. He then made up, for himself what, according to the
Spanish practice and phrase, might properly be called a complete espediente or record of his mining title. To this he himself,
with his own hand, prefixed a heading or table of contents. That
table truly stated the contents; and they were 1st, a copy of his
first petitition of November 22d, 1845, certified by Chabolla
January 13th, 1846. 2d, by a copy of his second jetition of
December 3d, 1845, certified by the same person. 8dly, bhi

originai duplicate act of possession, dated December 80th, 1845.
4thly, the receipt for fees. 5thly, his copy of the article of
partnership authenticated by the Prefect, December 8th, 1845.
When Castillero went to Mexico in April, 1846, he took this
esyediente with him. We call it Castillero's espediente. Late in
December, 1846, he confirmed the contract of Avio and sold
several of his shares to Alexander Forbes. He thereupon deliVered this espediene to that gentleman.
Mr. Alexander Forbes had it in his possession whilst in California in 1848. He returned to Mexico in Mare, 1848, leaving
this esjediente with Walkinshaw, the local -Director of the
mining operations. Walkinshaw was dismissed from office in
1849, and thenceforth until his death, he was on ill terms with
the Aviadores. In 1853, he sued them. In 1854 his suit was
dismissed. He was a peculiar man and in very ill health for
two years prior to May, 1858. At that date, he went to Scotland
and soon died. In July, 1860, this espdiente was found in the
hands of his executors, in an envelope endorsed in Walkinshaw's
own handwriting. All the papers, as called for in the table of
contents, were found with it except the c6py of the article of
partnership. How that became detached is not proven: it is
unknown. Perhaps James A. Forbes has it.
In 1857, Alexander Forbes being veryaged, had retited from
business, and gone to reside in London. Walkinshaw was
hostile to the Aviadores, and petulant from'ill health. All who

and he was plotting with Laurencel. The whole juggle about
discrepancies between copies was gotten up at this date under
his instructions. It was the offspring of his subtle and fraudu.
lent genius.
On January 20t, 1848, Mr. Alexander Forbes was at the
mine, giving attention to its development.
Walkinshaw was
directoz. James A. Forbes was living near it, and was, no
doubt, striving to supplant Walkinshaw, which he effected soon
afterwards, though his own term in office was of brief duration.
At this time James A. Forbes eems to have been quite officiou.4

The United Stdes vs. Andres Castillero.
He played the anxiously subservient to Alexander Forbes.
Among other things, James A. Forbes, at this date, wrote out,
for what reason none but himself can now tell, a very formal
espediente, doing every part of the wol-k with his own hands.
He did not copy this from the papers in the Alcalde's office but
from Castillero's es ediente, then in the possession of Alexander
Forbes. He made two alterations from it. This was perfectly
idle, and is only explicable by his tendency to falsification. He
altered the date of Castillero's first representation as to place,
making it "Pueblo of San Jos6 Guadalupe," instead of "Mission
of Sta- Clara." He left out of the receipt for fees the repetitious
statement, that the mine was on Berreyesa's land. He presented
this paper to James W. Weekes, then Alcalde, who signed the
certificate prepared for him, that it was a true copy, "made to
the letter," of the "espediente," in the archives of the jusgado.
Weekes was an American sailor; he was ignorant and intemperate, but intelligent and honest. Such is the proof. He had
often seen the originals in the jusgado. He thought the papers
a true copy, and -did not advert to the necessity of making a
comparison. This is the paper which the Government counsel
call the Weekes es'ediente. It was not given in evidence, or
relied upon by the claimant. His attorney's clerk, indeed, used
it in making a copy to be annexed to the petition before the
Land Commissions. No other use was ever made- of it, except
by the Government's counsel. They put it in evidence, in the
District Court, in 1857, for the purpose of showing discrepancies
in copies.
The title papers given in evidence by the claimant before the
Land Commissioners, and alone relied upon throughout, were
the originals which had always remained of record; first, in the
Ahalde's jusgado, then in the office of the Mayor of San Jos6,
to which it was removed from the jusgado, -Vith a great quantity
of other Spanish documents, on the change of Government, and
afterwards in the office of the Recorder of Santa Clara County,
to which it was removed in January, 1851. The custody in
these respective offices is most explicitly proven by a vast
amount of unimpeached and clear testimony in each and every

ton testified that in February, 1853, he searched for a record of
them in. the hookzs, at James A. Forbes' request, but "not for the
paper itself." He further said, "I think I must have found it
by accident, because no one ever asked me to search for it."
This was in 1853. The Government counsel proved the genuine
official endorsement upon it of a prior file mark. "Filed 3
o'clock, P. M., 18th Jan'y, 1851; J. T. Richardson, Recorder,

that James A. Forbes, the Government's own witness, "foisted "
this paper into the Recorder's office in 1853, and that, too, in
opposition to his own testimony.

superabundantly proven, and their continuing public custody
clearly established, we have called the Alcakde's espediente. The
Government's counsel is pleased to designate it the ifallecl es.
pediente.

The Government's counsel speaks of another paper-which he
dignifies with the title of the Fernandez espediente. This paper
performs no very important office. It was put in e' idence
merely as part of the chain of circumstances showing continuous
custody of the Alcalde's aspediente in the jusgado. It is an exact
and faithful copy of that paper, made by Pacheco, the Alcalde'd
secretary, and certified by Ohabolla, then Alcalde, on August 13,
1846. It is distinctly verified by unimpeached evidence. Trans.
cript, pp. 622-624.
The article of partnership, though inserted in Castillero's own
espediente, does not appear in the Alcalde's. It was not neces.
sary to file it with the Alcalde. It was deposited with the
Prefect. Castillero appears to have thought it proper to have
the fact noted in the Alcalde's record, that a partnership had
been formed. When going to Mexico, in April, 1846, he drafted
and left with General Castro, his partner, a petition setting forth
the fact. Castro afterwards, in June, '1846, had this petiaon

engrossed, signed it, and presented it to Dolores Pacheco, then
Alcalde, who ordered it to be archived. It was accordingly then
attached to the Alcalde's espediente. The claimant's counsel did
not put in or prove this petition, as any part of their case. They
regarded it as immaterial. The Government's counsel put it in
evidence in the District -Court in 1857, as part of the game of
difference in copies.
This idle show about trivial differences in copies, naturally
induced the claimant to put in much evidence merely to answer
it, but which was otherwise wholly useless. The attempt to
confuse on )ne side, has led,-oi the other, to the multiplication
of oral evidence of little moment and to the production of papers
essentially unimportant. Thus the record has been expanded
and the case complicated with a variety of irrelevant issues
But the opposition will not succeed in this attempt,
" to rise,
By nonsense piled on nonsense to the skies."

Diligence is indeed somewhat tasked by the mass of materials;
but-the most moderate share of intelligence is enough to enable
integrity tb see its way.
When Castillero's esyediente was found among Walkinshaw's
papers, in 1860, it was put in evidence. Many of the witnesses were recalled and some were added. Its authenticity was
fully and clearly proven. But it had no office to perform, except
the superfluous one of giving a precise clue to every one of the
trivial discrepancies in copies before adverted to. Except in
some place where the very madness of imputation reigned, these
discrepancies would be regarded as insignificant and unworthy
of any answer or any notice. 1 Black, pp. 284, 286.
It is a gross mistake to say that the claimant produced paper
proofs of title, which though professing to correspond, are found
to conflict. -*fismining title-paper, from first to last,-his only
docuriitary proof of that title before the Commissioners or at
any stage,-was the original record of 1845, as found in the filed

act of possess on. Every other paper came in incidentally in

the singular assault made upon this title or in the resistance to
that assault.
It is not true that Castillero, in any of his-deeds, ever referred
to the artiele of partnership as a basis of his title. He referred
to it merely in his covenants that the restraint upon alienation
imposed by it should not be an impediment to his vendee's title,
and that his partners shall ratify that title. This plainly appears
oy his deeds in the record. His deeds were drawn by Mr. Romero, an able Mexican lawyer. They state his title to be as
discoveror, which was precisely the fundamental truth. It was
not necessary nor is it usual to detail, in a deed of sale, every
thing dozLe by the grantor to secure his title. Transcript, p. 1203.
Besides, how frivolous is this notion of non-reference. Surely
no .r. _an deny, without a blush, that Castillero did in face,
take some proceedings before the Alcalde I And again, a reference to the article of partnership was itself a reference to those
proceedings. The article asserts that Castillero conformed "in
all respects to the ordinance of mining."
In December, 1850, Jones, the counsel for Berreye'sa, desiring
to take some technical exceptions to the title of the Almaden
Company, sought for the original title papers. The original, in
Spanish law and practice, is not the record in the public office,
where legal action is had, but the copia autorizada,or authenticated document, issued from such office..,

sion, i. e. the duplicate delivered to Gastillero was, at this' time,
in the possession of Walkinshaw. He was full of rage and hos.
tility, on account of his dismissal from office in 1849, and it was
not known to be in his possession by any of the Aviadores, or their
agents in California. It is presumable that the Castillo Lanzas'
dispatch was then in Mexico. It certainly was in Tepic, in that
year. Transc., p. 68. General Halleck testified, that he believed

declared. An Act of Congress was passed, May 13, 1846, which
recognized war as existing. On May 12, 1846, Castillero applied
for the Nvo leagues of 1and; and on the 20th, they were granted
to him. In 1850, without the papers before him, or being able
to specif'y their precise dates, General Halleck testified to his
belief that the grant was made before the declaration of war.
What a shocking anachronism ! Are we contending with men
of common sense, or with men merely seeking a pretence for
confiscation, and willing to cover the wrong by any paltry subterfuge?
The denial of our allegations is absolutely frivolous. Notori
ous facts, which it is impossible materially to post-date, or ante
date, raise so strong a presumption in the claimant'sfavor, that,
in the absence of all written evidence or other direct proof, it
would be an irresistible inference, that transactions essentially of
the nature indicated by him must have taken place at the very
times alleged. The proceedings before the Alcalde are precisely
such as the circumstances would naturally have given rise to;
and he had no means of resorting to any other. That they
could have been omitted is incredible. And if the city, with all
things therein, had been swallowed up by an earthquake, shortly
after Castillero's visit to Mexico, in May, 1846, no fair mind
would doubt his having appeared before the Junta previously
to the catastrophe, related his discovery, solicited governmental
aid, and received at least as much as is now claimed to have
been conceded.
To impugn the known truth, as your Honors are urged to do.'
or to violate the public faith, by confiscating the estate of private
individuals, on such petty pretences as have been suggested,
would be a reproach to the American name, and a lasting stigma
upon the justice of our country.
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD. These are appeals from a lecree of
the District Court of the United States for the Northern District
of California, brought here under the Act of Congress of the
8d of March, 1851, entitled "an Act to ascertain and settle the
private land claims" in that State.

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

The United Slates vs. Andres Castillero.

Provision was made by the first section of that act for the
appointment of Commissioners to examiiie all such claims, and
decide upon their validity; and it was provided by the 8th
section of the act, that every person claiming land in that State
by virtue of any right or title derived from the Spanish or Mexican Governments, should present the same to those Commissioners for their adjudication.
Pursuant to that requirement, Andres Castillero, on the 30th
day of September, 1852, presented the claim in controversy for
adjudication to the Board of Commissioners constituted under
that act, and at the same time submitted certain documentary
evidences of title, to show that the claim ought to be confirmed.
Among other things, he represented in his petition to the effect,
that, in the year 1845, he discovered a mine of cinnabar in tho
then jurisdiction of San Jos6, which is now known as the County
of Santa Clara, in the State of California; and that having
formed a company for working the ming, he, on the 3d day of
December of that year, received from the Magistrate of that
jurisdiction, in due form, the juridical possession of the mine,
and also of certain adjacent land, to the extent of three thou.
sand varas in all directions, averring, in the same connection,
that all the facts so alleged would appear by the duly authenticated papers issued from the office of that Magistrate, copie of
which were submitted with the petition. He also represented,
that soon after his discovery, the record of his mining possession, or a testimonio of the same, was submitted to the Junta &l
Fomento y Administrativa de Mineria,the highest mining tribunal

of Mexico; and that the members of that tribunal, on the 14th
day of May, 4846, after an examination of the laws relative
thereto, and mature deliberation, declared that the juridical
possession so given, although embracing an unusually large
extent of land, was in conformity to law, and Muly justified by
the circumstances of the case, and recommended to the Presi
dent through the Minister of Justicenot only that his mining
possession should be confirmed, but that two square leagues ot
land should also be granted to him in fee for the benefit of his
mining operations. Petitioner accordingly claimed the two;

leagues of land in fee as well as the mining possession, and in
support of the claim to the land, he alleged that the Minister of
Justice, on the 20th day of the same month, informed the Junta
le Fomento that the President had acceded to the recommenda
tizn and granted the land; that on the same day he also notified
the Minister of Relations of the same fact, in order that the
proper decree might be issued; and that the Minister of Relations, on the 23d day of May, 1846, issued his order to the Governor of the Department, directing him to put the petitioner in
tbe possession of the same two square leagues of land. Referring to the last dispatch, and assuming it to be a grant, he also
alleged in his petition, that on receiving the same, he started to
go to that Department for the purpose of surveying the land and
taking juridical possession of the same, but was interrupted in
his journey- and prevented from so doing by the operations of
the war between the two countries.
Such is the substance of the representations of the petition su
far as respects the title of the claimant, but he also alleged that
he had ever since continued in possession both of the mine and
the land, and that he and those claiming under him had made
extensive and expensive improvements on the premises. Claimant presented certain documentary evidences of title before the
Commissioners which it becomes important to notice, because it
was upon those that he relied to show that the prayer of his
petition ought to be granted. They consisted of certain proceedings alleged to have taken place before the Alcalde of San
Jos6 Guadalupe in respect to the registry of the mine, and certain subsequent proceedings of the Junta de Fomen o and other
public authorities of the home government, which were introduced as showing a confirmation of the doings of the Alcalde
in respect to the registry of the mine and an absolute grant of
the two square leagues of land.
.. Petitioners in such cases are required by the act of Congress not only, to present their claims to the Commissioners, but
also the documentary evidences of title pn which they rely to
support the same; and in obedience 0o that reqoiremeut the

claimant presented the documents referred to in his petition, of
which the following is a summary:
1. His petition, dated November 22d, 1845, addressed to the
Alcalde of first nomination, representing that he had discovered
a vein of silver with a ley of gold on the rancho of Jos6 Reyes
Berreyesa, which he wished to work in company, and request
ing the Alcalde, in conformity with the ordinance on mining, to
fix up notices in public places of the jurisdiction, in order to
make sure of his right when the time for the juridical possession
should arrive, according to the laws upon that subject. Immediately following the petition is a certificate signed by Pedro
Chabolla, certifying that the petition is a copy of the original to
which he refers, and which certificate purports to have been
executed on the 13th day of January, 1846, at the Pueblo of
San Jos6 Guadalupe, and to have been signed in the presence
of two assisting witnesses.
2. Claimant also introduced another document purporting to
be a supplemental petition to the same Alcalde, dated the 3rd
day of December, 1845, in which he represented that, in addition
to silver with a iey of gold, he had, in the presence of several
bystanders, taken out liquid quicksilver from the mine, and
requested to add that statement to his previous representation
in order to secure his right.. Both of the petitions purport to
have been executed at the Mission of Santa Clara, and to hive
been signed by the claimant. Appended to the supplemental
petition, also, is a certificate signed by Pedro Chabolla, which
is of the same date and in all respects similar to the one con
aected with the first petition.
8. Following the last named petition and certificate is the
document filed before the Commissioners as the copy of an original then relied on by the claimant as the proper evidence to
show that he made due registry of the mine, and that the juridical possession of the same was duly given to him by competent authority in accordance with the regulations of the

ship.
Like the preceding petitions, it was executed at the Mission
of Santa Clara; and by its terms it purports to be a partnership
between the claimant and Jos6 Castro, Secundino Robles, and
Teodoro Robles, and Josd Maria R..S. del Real, for the working
"of a mine of silver, gold 2ld quicksilver, in the rancho of Jos6
Reyes Berreyesa, in thd jurisdi~tion of the pueblo of San Jos6
Guadalupe." Article 1 provides to the effect that the claimant,
"conforming in all respects to the ordinance of mining, forms
a regular perpetual partnership" with the persons before named,
adding that "the half of the mine, which is that of which he can
lispose, will be divided into three parts'-that is, "four shares to
Jos6 Castro, four shares to S. and T. Robles, and the other four
shares" to the Padre Real, "as a perpetual donation." Parties
were restrained by the instrument from alienating their shares;
and the provision was, that the expenses should be borne in
proportion to the shaies. Stipulation was also made that the
dlaimant should have charge of the operations when present,
but in his absence they were to be conducted by the Padre Real,
and it was also stipulated that the agreement should be authenticated by Manuel Castro, the Prefect of the Second District.
His certificate is appended to the document, in which he certifies, under date of the 8th of December, 1845, that it is a copy of
the original, and the certificate purports to have been executed
at Santa.Clara, in the presence of the Alcalde, to whom the petitions were addressed. Congress recognized the existence of war
between Mexico and the United States, a the 13th of May, 1846,
and it is not denied that the official functions of the Mexican
officers in that Department entirely ceased as early as the 7th of
July in that year. Reference to these dates becomes necegsary,

especially to the latter, because after that time the civil ,fficers
in that Department during the war were such as were appointed
by'our military commanders.
5. He also introduced another certificate, which applies to
each and all of the foregoing documents. It is signed by James
W. Weekes, Alcalde of San Jos6 Guadalupe, and reads as
follows:
"I certify in due form, that the foregoing is a faithful copy,
made to the letter from its 6riginal, the ' espediente' of the mine
of Santa Clara, or New Almaden, which .exists in the archives
under my charge, to which I refer. And in testimony thereof
I have signed it this 20th day of January, 1848."
Four additional certificates are also appended to this espedi.
ente, as it has been called in argument at the bar.. Of these, the
first was executed at San Francisco, and is signed by James
Alexander Forbes, British Vice-Consul, in which he certifies
under date of the 21st of January, 1848, that the signature of
the last named Alcalde is the true and proper handwriting of
the person it represents. None of the other three were executed
in California, but respectively bear date at Tepic, in the Department of Jalisco, One is signed by Jesus Vejar, a notary public,
in which he certifies under date of the 15th of March, 1850, to
the effect that the signature of the British Vice-Consul is gen
uine. Another is, the signature of the first Alcalde at that place,
in which he certifies under the same date that the mark and
signature of the notary are those he is accustomed to use, and
the last is the certificate of the Consul of the United States at
that place, in which he certifies, under date of the 1st of December 1850, that "the signatures attached to the foregoing document are in the true handwriting of the subscribers."
II. Other documents were also introduced by the claimant as
showing a confirmation of the doings of the Alcalde in respect to
the registry of the mine, and which it is insisted by his counsel
establish his right to the two square leagues of land. They do
not purport to be originals, but were admitted in evidence as
sworn copies of originals, alleged to be on file in the archives of

Government at the capital of the Republic. Briefly described, the
documents of this class, introduced before the bommissioners, are
as follows:
1. Copy of a letter from the claimant, dated at the Mission of
Santa Clara on the 19th of February, 1846, and addressed to
Tomas Ramon del Moral, in which he states in effect that he has
discovered an abundant deposit of cinnabar, and that he sends
with the communication some of the ore and a little quicksilver,
that it may be assayed.
2. He also introduced a copy of a letter from J. J. de Herrera,
which was addressed to the same person as the preceding letter,
in which the writer, under date of the 13th of April, 1846, pro
fesses to give certain extracts from two letters received by him
at the City of Mexico from the claimant, while the latter was at
the Mission of Santa Clara. These letters, as described in the
copy of the communication given in evidence, were dated on the
19th and 22d of February, in the same year, and the extracts
represent the claimant as saying that at the distance of five
leagues from the Mission to the west he had discovered and
denounced a very abundant mine of quicksilver, and that he
had sent to his correspondent some of the ore procured from the
top of the vein to confirm his statement, together with a little
quickesilver which was taken out with the greatest facility.
3. Copies of two communications, showing that the specim6ns
of ore so sent were submitted to the Junta Facultativa,and that
an assay founded on a mean of the different specimens, gave a
"ly" of twenty-five and a half per cent.
-4. Copy of a letter or report from the President of the Junta
to the Minister 'of Justice, under date of the 5th of May, 1846,
communicating the fact of the reception of the specimens of ore
and of the successful result of the assay.
5. Copy of the reply of the Minister of' Justice, dated fou
days afterwards, in which he states that the President ad interim
of the Republic, learns with satisfaction that the claimant has
discovered a deposit of quicksilver of excellent quality.
6. Claimant also introduced a copy of a communication signed
by him under date of the 12th of May, 1846, addressed to the

Junta for the encouragement and administration of mining, as
fully set forth in the transcript.
Referring to his discovery as a mine of quicksilver in the
Mission of Santa Clara, he states that he has denounced and
taken possession, not only of said mine named Santa Clara, but
also of an extent of three thousand varas in all directions; that
he has formed a company to work it, constructed the pit, and
complied with all the conditions prescribed by the ordinance.
Intimation is there given that he could easily have secured aid
from foreign houses, but that he preferred that the establishment
should be entirely national, and for that reason had not hesitated to apply to the Junta for such assistance as he at present
needed. His representation was that he only wanted a small
advance of $5,000, on account of the scarcity of coin in that
Department, and an immediate remittance to the mine of retorts,
cylinders, and other small distilling apparatus, and also iron
flasks for bottling up the quicksilver- He suggested that he
would have proposed a contract of partnership to the Junta as
an avio, or some other agreement, if there had been time to fur.
nish the proofs and details which would-be required for such an
arrangement, but being obliged to leave the capital within a few
days, he found it necessary to restrict himself to "that whieh
appears to present no difficulty and which may open a way to
a future agreement." What he desired of the Junta was not
only that they should accede to his requests as far as they had
the power, but that they should send such as they could not
grant to the Supreme Government, recommending their adoption, and with that view he submitted nine propositions, which
were as follows:
"First. The Junta, in the act of approving the agreement,
will give me a draft for $5,000 on some mercantile house in
Mazatlan.
"Second. On my part, I bind myself to place in said port,
within six months after leaving it, fifty quintals of quicksilver,
at the rate of $100 each, which I will send from the first taken
out, with absolute preference over every other engagement.
"Third. The Junta will order that there be placed at my dis

position before leaving the capital, the eight iron retorts which
it has in its office, and all the quicksilver flasks which can be
found in the negociacton of Tasco, which are fit for use; and,
lastly, it will deliver to Senior Don Tomas Ramon del Moral,
my attorney, the sums to pay for the retorts, cylinders, and other
kinds of small apparatus, which may be ordered to be made for
the negociacion, to the amount of $1000.
"Fourth. I will receive the retorts of the Junta at cost puce,
and the flasks which I may select at $2 a piece, agreeably with
their valuation.
"Fifth. The ascertained value of said retorts and flasks, and
that of the sums which may be deliverpd to Senor Moral, I will
return in the term of one year from this agreement, 'and also the
premium on the draft on Mazatlan, in quicksilver, placed in said
port at the price. of $100 the quintal; but if the Junta should
wish to take one or more 'acciones' in the mine, it shall be left
as a part payment of the sum corresponding to one or more
'barras.'
"Sixth. While the company is being formed, during the period
of one year, counted from the date on which this agreement shall
be approved, and the $5,000 spoken of in the first proposition
being paid, I will give the preference to the Junta in the sale of

",Seventh. The Junta shall represent to the Supreme Go vernment the necessity of approving the possession which has been
given me of the mine by the local authorities of California, in
the same terms as those in which I now hold it.
"Eighth. It shall also represent the advantage of there being
granted to me, as a colonist, two square leagues upon the Lud
of my mining possession, with the object of being able to use the

"Ninth. For the compliance of this contract I pledge the nine
itself and all its appurtenances."
7. On the 14th of the same month the President of the Junta
communicated the letter of the claimant, or petition as hi calls
it to the Minister of Justice, and in that communicativa the mine
is described as the quicksilver mine in the Missiun of Santa

Clara in the Department of California. Claimant also intro.
duced a copy of that communication. Among other things, the
writer states that the Junta "has no hesitation in recommending
the petition" to the favorable consideration of the Government;
that they, the Junta, are of the opinion that the sum of $5,000
should be advanced to the applicant on the terms proposed, and
that they should be authorized to furnish him with such iron
retorts and flasks as they had on hand, and to advance him the
other $1,000 asked, which, as they stated, could be employed in
the construction of retorts, cylinders, and other small apparatus
for the use of the mine.
They also refer to the reasons assigned by the claimant for
deferring the formation of a contract of partnership, or avio, and
state, in effect, that they, the Junta, regard it as satisfactory.
Reference is also made to that part of the claimant's petition in
which he represents that he has denounced and taken possession
not only of the mine, but also of an extent of three thousand
varas in all directions, and their views upon that subject were,
that the possession given by the local authorities was "not in
conformity with the ordinance," because it embraced an extent
greater than the ordinance allowed, but, notwithstanding that
fact, they presented various arguments for the consideration of
the Department to show, that, unde the circumstances of the
cases, it might be sustained. In respect to the two square
leagues of land solicited by the claimant as a colonist, the Junta
declined to express any opinion for or against the application
for the reason, as stated, that they had no information upon the
subject, and therefore left that matter to be decided by the
President as he might think proper.
8. Both the petition of the claimant and the recommendation
of the Junta were, by the Minister of Justice, laid before the
President, and the former on the 20th of May, 1846, sent a
dispatch to the Junta. informing them that the President had
been pleased to approve, in all its parts, the agreement made
with the claimant, "in order to commence the working ofsaid mine,"
and that the corresponding communication was made to the
Minister of Relations to issue the proper orders respecting that

which was contained in the eighth proposition for the grant of
lands in that Department. Under the same date a -decree, so
called, wai entered by the Minister of Justice in the margin of
the communication received by him from the Junta, in the fol.
lowing terms: "Granted in the terms which are proposed, and
with respect to the land; let the corresponding order issue to
the Ministe of Relations for the proper measures of- his office,
with the xiderstanding that the Government' accedes to the
petition." Copies of the dispatch of the Minister of Justice and
of the last named document were also introduced by the
claimant. "
9. On the same day, the Minister of Justice sent a dispatch to
the Minister of Relations, informing him of what had been done;
in which it is also stated, that the President had acceded to the
petition of the claimant, and that the dispatch was transmitted
to the end that there might be granted to the claimant, as a
colonist, two square .leagues upon the land of his mining possession. Copy of that dispatch was also introduced by the
claimant:
10. Finally, the claimant introduced a copy of a dispatch
from the Minister of Relations to the Governor of California,
dated on the 23d day of May, 1846, in which the former, after
transcribing the dispatch to him from the Minister of Justice,
and incorporating a copy of the same into his own dispatch, as
an explanation of the transaction, adds as follows: "And I
transcribe it to your Excellency, that in conformity with the
provisions of the laws and decrees relative to colonization, you
may give Setior Castillero possession of the two square leagues
above mentioned."
Remark should be made, that in all of the documents intro.
duced as copies of originals on file in the Department of the
Supreme Government, the mine is described as one discovered
by the claimant in the, Mission of Santa Clara; and in no one
of them is any allusion made to the fact that it was situated on
the rancho of Jos6 Reyes Berreyesa, as represented in the first
petition of the claimant, and repeated in the act of juridi3al
possession alleged to have been executed by the Alcalde.

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
11. Parol testimony was also introduced by the claimant in
support of his claim, both to the mine and to the two square
lea sues of land, to which some brief reference will be made.
I6 proved by Charles S. Lyman, that he, the witness, made a
survey of the land around the mine in the month of February,
1848, at the request of James Alexander Forbes, of California,
and Alexander Forbes, of Tepic, in Mexico, who was at the
mine at the time of the surv ey. His orders were to lay out two
square leagues; and he states that he was shown a grant, or a
copy of a grant, for that quantity from the Mexican Government. They requested him to locate the grant so as to cover
certain mining rights called "pertenencia," extending three thousand varas in every direction from the mouth'of the mine; and
he states that it was so surveyed as to have the mouth of the
mine as nearly in the centre as could be without covering land
of the neighboring ranchos claimed by individual owners. Field
notes of that survey were exhibited, and Fernando Alden, who
was also examined by the claimant, testifies that he assisted in
making a part of it, and he confirms the testimony of the first
witness as to the location of the alleged grant. By his testimony it also appears that he heard of the grant in 1846, when
he was in Mexico, and that he was employed by Alexander
Forbes, the agent and partner of the claimant, to go to California for the purpose of working the mine, erecting buildings, and
occupying the land so granted ; and he testifies that he first went
to live on the land about the 1st of April, 1847, and continued
to reside there until about a year before he gave his testimony,
acting as the agent and overseer of the company holding under
the claimant. Witnesses were also examined by the claimant
to prove that the copy of the act of possession executed by the
Alcalde, and the other papers included in that espediente, were
true copies of the originals, and that the originals were genuine
documents. To prove these facts, he called and examined Frank
Lewis, Deputy Recorder for the County of Santa Clara, who,
upon being shown a certain paper entitled "Posesion de la mina
de St Clara de Affo 1845," stated that he obtained it from the
office f the Recorder of that county. Having made that state.

ment, the witness was then requested to compare th. copies filed
in the case with the corresponding parts of that paper; and after
naving done so, he testified that they were true and exact copies.
Two witnesses, Antonio Sunol and Jcs" Noriega, who, it will be
remembered, were the assisting witnesses io the act of possession executed by the Alcalde, were also called and examined by
the claimant in respect to the authenticity of the supposed original document. They were accordingly requested to examine
the same, and having complied with that request, respectively
testified that all the signatures, including their own, were genuine. Clafmant also called and examined Jos6 Maria La Fragua
in respect to the class of documents introduced as copies of
originals on file in the archives of the Supreme Government,
and his testimony was to the effect that he had compared all
those documents with the originals in the City of Mexico, and
found them to be correct.
Commissioners, or a majority of them, adjudged that the claim
to the mine was valid, and confirmed the mining right or privilege of the claimant, as pertenencia, to the extent of three thousand varas in all directions from the mouth of the mine; but
they unanimously adjudged the claim to the two square leagues
of land to be invalid, and rejected that part of the claim.
Appeal was taken both by the claimant and by the United
States to the District Court of the United States for the lNorthern
District of California.
Much additional documentary evidence was introduced in the
District Court, and -more than one hundred additional witnesses
were examined in respect to the matters involved, or supposed
to be involved, in the controversy. Parties Were" fully heard,
and on the 18th day of January, 1861, the District Court entered a
decree confirming the claim to the mine, but' diminishing the
mining right, or privilege, as compared with the decree of the
Commissioners, and adjudging the claim to the two square
leagues of land to be invalid and rejecting the same. By the
terms of the decree, the mining right, or privilege, of the.claimant is described and defined as "'apiece of land embracing a
superficial area, measured oA a horizontal plane, equivalent to

seven pertenencas," regarding each pertenencia as a solid of a
rectangular base two hundred varas long, of the width established
by the ordinance, and in depth extending from and, including
the surface, to the centre of the earth.
Whereupon both parties appealed to this Court. No. 123 is
the appeal of the claimant, and No. 133 is a cross-appeal of the
United States.
Power to decide upon the validity of any claim presented to
land in California, by virtue of any right or title derived from
the Spanish or Mexican Government, as matter of original jurisdiction, is, by the Act of the 3d of March, 1851, exclsively con-ferred upon the Commissioners appointed under the first section
of that Act. Appellate jurisdiction, however; is conferred upon
the respective District Courts of the United States for the Northern and Southern Districts of California, and finlly upon this
Court. In deciding upon any such claim, the rule of decision is,
as prescribed by the eleventh section of the Act, that the Court
or tribunal making the decision shall be governed by the treaty
under which the lands were acquired, the law of nations, the
laws, usages, and customs of the government ceding the same,
the principles of equity, and the decisions of this Court, so far as
they are applicable.
III. Enough has already been remarked, in view of those pro.
visions, to show that there are three principal questions involved
inthe record of very considerable importance.
First. Whether the claim of the petitioner to the two square
leagues of land, under the rules of decision already mentioned,
is shown by the documentary and other evidence to be a valid one
within the meaning of the eighth section of the Act providing
for the adjudication.
Secondly. Whether the Commissioners had jurisdiction to
decide upon the validity of the claim to the mine and mining
right, or privilege, as described in the petition, or in other words
whether the claim to the mine, together with the pertenencias
to the same, as recogni~ed' ,iithe Mining Ordinance, is a claim
to land within the meaning of the provisions of the 8th section
of that Act.

DECEM[BER TERM 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Odstillero.
Thidly. Whether the claim to the mine, including the mining
right, or privilege, as set forth in the petition, is shown by the
documentary and other evidence to be a valid one under the
rules of decision already described.
1. Title to the two square leagues of land, it is insisted, became
vested in the claimant by virtue of the documents on file in the
Department of the Supreme Government, as evidenced by the
copies filed in the case at the time the petition was presented to
the Commissioners. They consist, it will be remembered, so far
as that part of the claim is concerned, of the communications
from the claimant to the Juntade Fomento, their report or recommendation to the Minister of Justice, his reply to the same,
together with the decree made by him in the margin of their
communication, and his dispatch to the Minister of Relations
and the dispatch of the Minister of Relations of the 28d of May,
1846, to the Governor of the Department where the land was
situated. Forty witnesses or more, mostly from the City of
Mexico, were examined by the claimant to prove the authenticity of those documents, or of the corresponding originals, on
file in the archives of the Supreme Government, and various
other proofs, in the form of exhibits, were also introduced for
the same purpose, fillig a lalge space in the transcript,which
contains more than three thousand five hundred pages of closely
printed matter.
Such testimony and proofs were regarded as essential, because
it was and is insisted by the United States that the documents
were fabricated, but in the view we have taken of the case it
will not be necessary to decide or consider that question, and
consequently neither the testimony of the witnesses or the
to the
6xhibits on that point will be reproduced. ,ccof'ding
evidence introduced by the claimant, Xa,'4o jparades y Arrillaga, assumed the functions of President ad, irn of the Republic
on the 15th day of December, 145, and.thk same.,prpofs show
that he continued in authority as. such intil the 29th day of
July of the following year, when he surrendered his power, and
for a time took command of the army.
Counsel for claimants assume that during that perod the

SUPRhME

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
President was in the exercise of extraordinary powers, a ad it
must be conceded that the evidence is full to that effect, although
it may well be doubted whether such of his official acts as were
in violation of law have ever been ratified by the Mexican Government. Assuming that the President was in the exercise of
extraordinary powers on the 23d day of May, 1846, the claimant
insists that the dispatch of that date from the Minister of Rela.
tions to the Governor of the Department of California, especially
when it is considered in connection with the marginal decree and
dispatch of the Minister of Justice of the 20th of the same month,
is of itself an absolute grant of the two square leagues of land
described in his petition.
Conceding the power of the acting President of the Republic
to make such a grant of the public domain, the question then
is one of construction, and in that view of the case it becomes
necessary to examine with care so much of the several documents as relate to the claim for the two square*leagues of land.
Petitioner's representation to the Junta de Fomento was that be
desired such a grant in order that he might be able to procure
sufficient fire-wood for his mining works, and the effect of his
request, as stated in his eighth proposition, was that they, the
Junta, should recommend to the Supreme Government that there
be granlted to him, "as a colonist," two square leagues upon the
land of his mining possession. When he"made that request for
a grant as a colonist he evidently referred to the colonization
laws as containing the authority to comply with his request and
make the grant. Those laws had then been in operation for
more than twenty years, and consequently he must have expected, even if the Government acceded to his petition, that the
grant would be issued in conformity to those laws, and of course
must be exeduted by the Governor, subject to the approval of
the Departmental Assembly.
Such also was the view taken of the matter by the Junta in
their communication to the Minister of Justice, as plainly appears from the language employed by them in describing his
eighth proposition. They refer to it as a petition in which the'
elaimant solicits as a colonist two square leagues of land "upon

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

161

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
the surface of his mining property for the purpose of supplying
himself with vie fire-wood necessary for the reduction of the
ores," evidently showing that they regarded it as an application
under the colonization laws. Nothing is expressed in the decree
or memerandum made by the Minister of Justice in the margin
of the communication from the Junta which, if rightfully understood, affords any countenance whatever to the views of the
claimant. Reliance is placed upon the introductory words, to
wit, Granted on the terms proposed," but it is so obvious from
what follows in the same connection, that those words refer to
the terms proposed is an arrangement for exploring and operating the mine, that it is difficult to see how any one can be
misled in regard to their import. Justification for that remark
will be found in the directions immediately given "with-respect
to the land," which are that the corresponding order be issued to
the Minister of Relations for the proper measures of his office,
with the understanding that the Supreme Government accedes
to the petition. Strong doubts are entertained whether the
order, 'iwith respect to the land," was intended as anything
more than the usual office direction to the corresponding cerk
in the Department to prepare and put in form a dispatch upon
the subject which should express the views embraced in the
marginal directions.
Support to.that view is certainly derived from the fact that a
dispatch was prepared and sent on the same day, .which, in its
concluding sentence, contains substantially the same language,
in the form of a request that thae "orders corresponding" may
be issued. Other matters, however, are stated in the dispatch
which ought not to be overlooked. After stating the fact that
he had laid the commanication of the Junta before the President,
'e proceeds to say that "1HsExcellency had been pleased to
approve, in all respects, the agreement 'made with the claimaub
in order to commence the working of said mine," adding that he
communiceites the information that there may be granted to the
claimant, as a colonist, the two square leagues of land, and requesting the Minister of Relations "to issue orders correspondiig."
Additional orders, therefore, were assumed to be necesgary, and
VOL. H.
11

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
the concluding sentence of the dispatch to the Minister of Relations, written on the same day, and already referred to, shows
what kind of orders were contemplated at the time the maiginal
decree was made. Prepared as those documents were on the
same day, they must be considered together, and when so considered, it is clear and beyond doubt, that the marginal decree
with respect to the land was not drafted or intended as a grant
or any evidence of a grant; for if it had been, the officer who
drafted it never would have asked for any order upon the subject from a co-ordinate Department of the Government.
Request was made by the claimant, in the first place, that a
grant might be made to him as a colonist, and it conclusively
appears, we think, from an examination of those dispatches, that
the Mexican officials who wrote them never for a moment con
templated that the claimant was to have a grant of land in any
othe.r mode than by the usual proceedings under the colonization laws. Abundant confirmation of that proposition, if any
be needed, is to be found in the dispatch from the Minister of
Relations to the Governor of the Department, which is the docu.
ment that the claimant professes to regard as an absolute grant
of the land described in his petition. Mexican officials, in their
correspondence upon official matters of domestic concern, usually
transcribe and incorporate into their own dispatches such communications as they have previously received upon the same
subject from other official sources. Such was the course pursued by the Minister of Relations in his dispatch to the Governor of the Department. He accordingly transcribed into his
dispatch a copy of the one sent to him from the Minister of
Justice, in which is also contained a copy bf the before mentioned communication to the Junta, and referring to the entire
dispatch, he states in effect, that he transcribed it to the Gov.
ernor in order that he, the Governor, in conformity with what is
prescribed by the laws and dispositions upon colonization, may
put the claimant in possession of the two square leagues of land
which are mentioned in the communication. Conformity to the
laws an i regulations upon the subject of colonization grants is
plainly .ontemplated and required by the directions of that

dispatch, and consequently it is clear that the Governor could
not put the claimant into the possession of the described tract in.
any other mode than by the usual proceedings under those laws.
2. Claimant calls this a grant, and it is his privilege to do so
if he sees fit; but it is -sin for him to expect that this Court
can give its sanction to any such manifest error. Vacant lands
in California belonged to the Supreme Government, and the
laws for the disposition of the same emanated from that source.
U. S. vs. Knight, .(1 Black, 242.)
General rules and regulations upon the subject were accordingly ordained, authorizing the Governors of Territories, under
certain specific conditions, to grant such lands to such of the
persons therein described as might ask for the sme for the
purpose of settlement and cultivation. Persons soliciting such
lands were required by those rules and regulations to address a
petition to the Governor, setting forth their names, country; profession and religion, and also to describe the lend asked for as
distinctly as possible, by means of a disefio or map annexed to
the petition. He was not required to prove his representations,
but it was made the duty of the Governor to obtain the necessary information to enable him to determine whether the case
fell within the conditions specified in the regulations, both as
regarded the applicant and the land. None of these conditions,
of course, were ever complied with, because the proofs show,
and it is conceded, that the dispatch was never transmitted to
the Governor, and that the claimant never returned to, that
Department. Application for a grant was never made under
that dispatch, and so far as appears, the Governor of the Department was never informed that it had been issued. Unless the
lands were vacant, such an application would have been fruitless, as the Governor had no power to grant any other than
vacant lands. Suppose it to be true that the mine is on the
rancho of Jos6 Reyes Berreyesa, or that of Just6s Larios, then
the power 6f the Governor to make he grant was entirely wanting; and it would not benefit the claimant if it were now shown
that the mine was and is on public land; because, if his repre-.
sentations are to be credited, he, and all those associatbd with

SUPREME COURT.

him, fully believed that it was not a part of tl e public domain.
Contrary to this view, it is insisted by the claimant that inasmuch as the President, by whose direction the dispatch was
issued and delivered to the party, was in the exercise of all the
powers of. Government, the non-delivery of the dispatch to
the Governor of the Department is wholly immaterial, that the
dispatch itself was a decree of concession, and the placing it
in the hands of the grantee was a sufficient delivery to vest an
equitable title at least in the claimant.
3. Power in the President to make such a grant is not denied
by the United States; but the question is, whether he exercised
or attempted to exercise any such power, which under the
circumstances must depend upon the construction to be given
to the dispatch of the Minister of Relations addressed to the
Governor of the Department. Explanations already given shovw
to a demonstration, we think, that such is not the true construction of the dispatch, and consequently the proposition of the
claimant cannot be sustained, and in rejecting the proposition
as untenable, we place our conclusion upon the ground that the
proposition assumes an erroneous construction of the. dispatch
under consideration, and is based entirely on that assumption.
.4. Attempt is made to support the proposition by some of the
remarks of this Court in the case of U S. v. Castillero, (23 How.,
468,) but it is evident that the construction given to the opinion
of the Court in that case is quite as erroneous as that given to
the dispatch of the Minister of Relations. Title to the island of
Santa Cruz, near the coast of that Department, was claimed in
that case by virtue of a regular grant from the Governor. Such
grant it is true had been issued by the Governor, under a special
dispatch from the Minister of the Interior, but the statement is
nevertheless correct that the claimant held the island under a
formal grant which was in the list of grants included in the
Jimeno index. Lands of the islands prior.to the 20th day of
July, 1838, had never been granted by the Governor of that
Department, and the better opinion is that the colonization laws
did not confer tjie power to make such grants. Authotity upon
that subject was on that day conferred upon the Governor in

DECEMBER ThiRM, 1862.

165

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
ccnnection with the Departmental Assembly by a general order
as is more fully explained in that opinion. Direction was given
to the Governor on the same day by a special dispatch that one
of the islands, such as the claimant in that case might select,
should be assigned to him before they proceeded under the
general order. He accordingly selected the island mentioned,
and the Governor issued title papers to the donee. Objection
was made here to the confirmation upon the ground that the
grant had never been approved by the Departmental Assembly,
but the Court overruled the objection. Absolute directions were
given in that case in respect to lands not authorized to be
granted under the colonization laws, and the power so conferred
had been exercised and the doings of the Governor in making
the grant acquiesced in for a period of eight years before the
jurisdiction of the territory was acquired by the United States.
Compare that statement, which is -undeniable, with the facts of
this case and it is obvions that the supposed analogy utterly
rails.
By the ternms of the dispatch under consideration the proceedings in this case were directed to be "in conformity with what
is prescribed by the laws and dispositions upon colonization,"
and of course the discretion of the Governor and that of the
Departmental Assembly were to be exercised in the performance
of their respective duties under-the obligations imposed- by law.
Something aso remained to be done by the claimant in order to
call forth the exercise of that discretion. He must prepare and
present his petition describing the land, and he must also
prepare and present, if required, a diseflo or map of the land in
order that the Governor might have the means of ascertaining
whether the tract solicited was vacant and so situated that it
-night properly be granted to the applicant. No such petition
was ever presented, and no action of any kind ever took place
upoL the subject. But we forbear to pursue the 6omparison, as
it must be'obvious, we think, to every unprejudiced mind, that
the two cases are in no substantial respect alike. For these
reasons we are of the :pinion that the claim to the two square
leagues of land cannot be sustained.

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
IV. Before entering upon the examination of the questions
involving the validity of the title of the claimant to the mine
and mining right or privilege claimed by him, it becomes necessary to consider and decide the question whether the Commissioners under the Act of the 3rd of March, 1851, had jurisdiction
over such a claim. Counsel for the claimant maintain the
affirmative of that question,obut the jurisdiction of the Commis.
sioners is denied by the counsel of the United States upon
several grounds:
1. They insist, in the first place, that the ownership of a mine
under the Mexican law was not the ownership of the land in
wihich the mine was situated; that it was simply the ownership
of the right to take from the soil the minerals therein to be
found, and was recognized as a right, severed from all public
and private land which was vested in the sovereign and which
did not pass by a grant of the land, and was capable of being
acquired only by a title from the sovereign power, wholly
distinct from the title to the land.
2. Several of those propositions, if properly restricted and
rightly applied, may well be admitted, because when so restricted
and applied they are 'undoubtedly correct. Mipes under the
Mezican law may be the subject of rightful ownership, distinct
from the land as such for agricultural or other ordinary uses.
Ownership of a mine, however, as secured under the mining
ordinance by registry and juridical possession, does not consist
alone in the right- to take from the soil the minerals therein to
be found, but it also embraces, if necessary to the working of
the mine, a right to the exclusive possession and use of the
Qirfiace of the land for an indefinite period within the boundaries
of the pertenencias appertaining*to the mining right or privilege.
Such rights are by law regarded as severed from private land
and also from public land when granted by the usual forms of
conveyance for agricultural or other ordinary purposes. Gamboa
by Heathfield, p. 132, sec. 5. Rights to a mine not registered
can only be acquired from the sovereign power, and it is true,
as contended by the United States, that the forms of such a Con.
veyance are wholly distinct from those employed in the ordinary

DECEMBER TERM 1962.
The United Stales vs. Andres Vdstillero.
process of granting lands. Another branch of the same propo.
.ution, not yet reproduced, may also be admitted in the same
qualified sense. Mining rights under Mexican laws undoubtedly
are usually held upon conditions not affecting the title to the
land is derived under the ordinary conveyances, and it is also
true that such rights may be. acquired and held by others
besides the owner of the land under the ordinary grants, and
that such rights are terminable when by their use the mineralscontained in the soil are wholly removed. Granting all this,
still the question arises whether a mine, togethe with the
mining right or privilege appertaining to the same, is not land
within the meaning of the Act of Congress under which the
Commissioners were appointed. Persons claiming lands in Cali.
fornia by virtue of any right or title derived from the Spanish
or Mexican Governments are required to present the same to the
Commissioners for adjudication, and of course the Commissioners
have jurisdiction to decide upon the validity of -all such claims.
9"Stat. at Large, 632.
3. Questions concerning mifnes and mining rights in Mexico
depend in a great measure upon the provisions of the Ordinance
of the 22d of May, 1783, which, although ordained long before
her independence, by the sovereign of the parent country, is
still in force and constitutes the principal code of .he Republic
upon that subject. Omitting Vnimportant words, article 1, 6f
the 5th title, reads as follows: Mines are the property of my
royal crown as well by their nature aiid 6rigin as by their reunion declared by law. Article 2 contains the following provision: Without separating them from-the'royal patrimony I
grant them to my subjects in property and -possessior in such
manner that they may sell them, rent them,, pass them by Will,
either in the way of inheritance or legav,-or in any other mannei alienate the right which in the mines belongs to them, on'
the same terms in which they themselves. possess it, and to per.

pany a certain additional number not exceding seven in all.
Writers do not exactly agree as to what iz a pertenencia, but
the better opinion is that it is a square of two hundred varas,
or five hundred and fifty feet. Primnaface, the owner of freehold lands, says Bainbridge, is entitled to all the minerals on
and underneath the surface with the exception of royal mines,
but he admits that the rule just stated is only a presumption of
law, and that a mine may form a distinct possession and inheritance by the production of a title distinct from that to the surface. Baiib., p. 4. He also admits that when mines form a
distinct inheritance and are not attached to the ownership of
the lands in which they are situate, or form a part of a demesne
of a manor, a title to them may be acquired or lost in the same
manner as to a common estate of freehold. Bainb) p. 31. Property in minerals unsevered from the land, says Collyer, whether
held together with or separately from the property in the land,
is what the law terms a corporeal hereditament, as distinguished
from the mere right to work for them, which is an incorporeal
hereditament; and he also says that an estate in minerals is considered an estate in land, and is transferable only under the same
restrictions, whether conveyed with or without a conveyance of
the adjacent soil. P. 1.
4. Courts of justice also have had occasion to assert the same
general principles. Plaintiff in ejectment was allowed, in Turner
vs. Reynolds, (23 Penn. R., p. 199,) to recover a coal mine which
te had described in, his writ as land, although his title was
under a conveyance to him, not of the tract of land, but of the
coal wljch was unsevered. Coal and minerals in place are land,
say the Court in Caldwell vs. Fulton, (31 Penn. R., 483,) adding
in the same connection that it is no longer to be doubted that
thef are subject to conveyance as such. Minerals beneath the
surface of the land, it is held in the same case, may be conveyed
by deed, distinct from the right to the surface, and in enforcing
that view the Court remark that nothing is more common in
that State than that the surface right should be in one and the
mineral in another, and we have no doubt that the rule there
laid down is correct. (kmyn vs. Wheatley, (Cro. Jac., 150.)

The.United Stats vs. Andres Gasillero.
Regarding the ,raim to be fiflly proved as set forth in-the
petition, which is the proper view to take of the case in determining The .questhn under consideration, we are of the opinion
that the objection to the jurisdiction of the Commissioners cannot be sustained, and it is accordingly overruled. Rockw,
chap. 11, p. 519-529; 580-532.
V. Having come to that conclusion, it becomes the duty of
this Court to examine the third question presented for d'ecision,
which, is, whether the claim to the mine, including -the mining
right or privilege as set forth in the petition, is shown by the
evidence to be a valid one within the rules of decision already
described.
1. Property in mines not discovered, and registered accoiding
to law, whether the mine was on public or private lands, was
vested, as has already appeared, exclusively in the Supreme
Government, so that private persons could not acquire it or any
interest init in any other mode than that prescribed in the provisions of the mining ordinance. Reference therefore must be
made to those provisions to ascertain what they are and what
the discoverer is required to do in order to acquire such a
property. Persons discovering one or more mineral hills absolutely new, in which there is no mine or trial pit open, may,
under article 1, title 6, of the ovdinance, acquire, in the principal vein which they may select, three pertenencias, continuous
or interrupted, according to certain prescribed measurements, and
if they have discovered more than one vein they may have one
pertenencia for each, to be determined and marked out within
the term of ten days.. Halleck Coil., p. 223, title 6, art. L
Discoverer of a new vein in a hill known and worked m
other parts may have in it two pertenencias, provided he specifies them within ten days, as mentioned in the preceding article;
p. 223, art. 2. Article 3 provides that he who asks for a new
mine in a vein known and worked in other places shall not b
a discoverer. Such persons as are described in the preceding
articles who desire to secure the benefit of those provisions are
required by article 4 of the same title to present themselves
with a witten statement before the Mining Deputation of that

ment, and the most particular and distinguishing feature of thE
place, hill or vein, of which they ask adjudication; all of which
circumstances and the hour in which the discoverer presents
himself shall be noted in a book of registry, which the Mining
Deputation and Notary, if there be one, shall keep, and this
being done/his written statement shall be' returned to him attested for his due security. Notices are then to be affixed to the
doors of the church, the Government houses, and other public
places of the town for due information, and the command is that
the discoverer within ninety' days shdll make or cause to be
made. in the vein or veins of his registry a pit or well (pozo) of
one and a half varas in diameter at its mouth and ten varas deep,
and that as soon as this shall be done, ofie of the deputies shall
personally go, accompaniecT by the Notary, if there be one, and if
there be none, by two assisting witnesses, and by the professional
mining expert of that Department, to inspect the course and
direction of the vein, its width, its dip or inclination to the horizon, called lag/ or slope, its hardness or softness, the' gfeater or
lesser solidity of its sides, and the ]3ind or principal indications
of the mifieral, taking an exact account of all this in order that
it may be added to the corresponding part of his registry, with
the evidence of possession, which shall immediately be given to
him in the name of the sovereign measuring to the party his
pertenencias, and causing him, as required in the subsequent
directions of the ordinance, to fix stakes in his boundaries.
Following these regulatioins, and as the conclusion of the article
in which they are contained, it is ordained to the effect that
when all this is done "there will be delivered to him an attested
copy of the proceedings as a corresponding title.""
Contestants appearing during the ninety days may prefer a
counter claim, and in that event it becomes the duty of the tribunal to adj idge the right- to him who shall make the bettei
proot but no one shall have any right to be heard unless he'

shall appear within that time. flallick Col., p. 224, arts. 4
and 5.
Strict compliance with the law is required, as appears by
all the writers upon the subject, and the 13th article, of title
19, provides in effect that the regulations shall be executed
witli the greatest exactness, precisely as they are written and
ifitended. Halleck Coll., p. 807; Rockw., p. 110; Thompson
on Mines, 183.
Properly speaking, says Gamboa, the register is the book in
which deeds and grants are entered for perpetual remembrance
thereof, so that -ifthey be lost, torn or defaced, or if any question be raised as to their identity or authenticity, recourse may
be had to such book. Registry, says the same author, is the
basis of a title to a mine, and the attributive cause of the subject's right of property in it; the Crown hiving subjected the
proprietor to this obligation when he made the mines common,
so that "'no mine can be lawfully worked until registry is
made, without which it is liable to be registered by any other
person; the form of .the ordinance not having been complied
with." Although that commentary was written before the date
of the ordinance which must furnish the guide ii this case, still
the views of the writer have an important bearing upon the
questions presented, as showing the universality of the rule,
that not even the discoverer can acquire any title to a mine
without registry. Gamboa, pp. 143, 145.
2. Petition ihthis case was presented to the Commissioners
on the 80th day of September, 1852, and on the 8th day of
January, 1856, their decree was made, confirming the claim to
the mine and to the entire mining right or privilege as therein
set forth. When th6 petition was filed, the claimant, as required
by law, also presented the documentary evidences of title on
which he relied to show that the claim ought to be confirmed
Throughout the whole period that the case was pending before
the Commissioners, those documents appear to have remained
on file as the foundation of the claim, and were finally .urged
upon the consideration of that tribunal as true copies of originals existing in the office of the magistrate before whom thev

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
purported to have been executed. Final adjudication was mado
by the Commissioners and the claim confirmed upon that ground,
and so far as appears, without the- slightest suspicion that the
copies filed in the case as documentary evidence under the Act
of Congress were not true copies of originals on file as alleged,
or that the originals did not import absolute verity. They of
course regarded the documents as authentic, and considering
how fully they are attested by official certificates, and that all
of the signatures were thoroughly proved by the positive testimony of two witnesses, it is difficult to see how they could have
come to any different conclusion, especially as there was no
opposing evidence in the case. Additional testimony, however,
of a very important character was taken upon the subject in the
District Court while the case was pending there, and it now
becomes the duty of this Court to decide the question upon a
very different state of facts. Other parties it seems, besides the
petitioner, are interested in this claim, and in order that the
evidence may be understood, and the testimony of the witnesses
properly appreciated, it becomes necessary to advert to the circumstances under which some of these parties acquired their
supposel title.
According to the testimony, the mine is within the county of
Santa Clara, and is situated in a spur of the Sierra Azul or Blue
Mountain, some sixteen or seventeen hundred feet above the
level of the sea, and fifteen miles southwardly from the city of
San Jos6. Discovery of mineral there was first made by the
Indians at a very early period, and they were accustomed to
obtain the mineral and use it for paint. Civilized men also had
knowledge of the mineral and of the location of the mine more
than twenty years before the discovery made by the claimant
but it no where appears that any one had discovered that the
mineral contained quicksilver. Two persons, Antonio Sufol
and Louis Chaboya erected a mill on a stream in that neighborhood some time during the year 1824, and tried to get silvei
out of the mineral. People generally knew that there was a
mine there, but they did not know what kind of a mineral it contained. By authoiity of the Government the claiinant in the

autumn of 1845, made a journey to the fort of John A. Suttei,
to negotiate with the proprietor for its purchase. Proceeding
from Monterey, he and his party, consisting of Jos6 Castro and
four others, besides a guard of some twenty soldiers, travelled
on the route leading through Santa Clara, and his testimony
shows that when near that place this mine was mentioned by
his principal companion. While there, some of the specimens
of the ore were shown to him, and one of the witnesses testified
that he visited the mine. Some examination of the mineral was.
made by him at that time, but he presently left and pursued hie
journey to Sutter's fort, where he arrived on the 11th day of
November, 1845. Remaining there but a short time, he then
returned to Santa Clara, where he pursued his investigations by
certain rude experiments, and discovered that the mineral con
tained quicksilver. His first step, as alleged, was'to form a
partnership for working t6e mine. Such an instrument bearing
date the 2d day of November, 1845, is one of the documents
which was filed with the petition. Original interests in mines
are usually acquired under a division of the mine into twentyfour parts, called barra.3 or shares, and by reference to the
instrument of partnership it will be seen that it was framed upon
that principle. Four shares were assigned to Jos6 Castro, four
shares to S. and T. Robles, four shares to the Padre Real and
twelve shares were retained by the claimant. They commenced
working the mine in a small way, and the claimant remained
there until some time in the month of March or April following,
when he left for the City of Mexico and never returned to that
Department. Affairs of the mine were left, at least kor a time,
in hands of the Padre Real.
On the 13th day of January, 1846, James Alexander Forbes,
British Vice Consul for California, wrote to Eustace Barron, of
the firm of Barron, Forbes & Co., at Tepic, that the cl.aiaant
was working a quicksilver mine near the Mission of Santa Clara
Alexander Forbes of the same firm and British Vice Consul a
Tepic, on the 15th day of April, 1846, wrote to J. A. Forbes
requesting the former to furnish him as correct information as
possib] , respecting the quicksilver mine mentioned in his pre.

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
ceding letter. Possession of the mine was, prior to the 22d
day of September, 1846, delivered to James Alexander Forbes
by the Padre Real, the agent of the claimant, as appears by the
fact that on that day he wrote to Alexander Forbes, of Tepic,
that he whs in charge of the mine and was about making a
bargain for four shares. Two shares were purchased by James
A. Forbes of S. & T. Robles about the time he took possession
of the mine. Arrangements were made with equal activity by
Alexander Forbes to get control of the same property. On th-e
24th day of November of the same year he instructed his agent
in the City of Mexico to purchase shares for him of the claimant,
and on the 28th day of the same month he concluded with the
agent of Jos6 Castro a contract for a lease or avio of the mine
for the term of sixteen Years, which term is not yet expired.
His agent purchased five shares for him in the City of Mexico,
and other shares were also purchased by James A. Forbes.
Shares were also purchased by Robert Walkinshaw and other
parties in the City of Mexico and elsewhere. Most or all of the
deeds of conveyance, whether executed by the claimant, Castro,
the Messrs. Robles, or the Padre Real, refer to the writing of
partnership as the foundation of the title, and none of them
make any reference whatever for any purpose to the supposed
act of registry, or to the act of juridical possession supposed to
have been executed by the Alcalde of San Jos6 Guadalupe.
3. Appeal was taken by the United States to the District
.Court on the 15th of April, 1856, and from that time to the date
of the _final decree the case was pending in that Court. Reasons
for the appeal, as assigned by the United States, are that the
claim is invalid, and that is the principal question that remains
to be considered. . Written notice was served upon the claimant
by the District Attorney of the United States on the 18th day
of August, 1856, to produce the original paper of which Exhibit
A is a copy, to be used in the examination of witnesses. Exhibit A comprises the documents filed with the petition as
copies of originals on file in the proper office of the Alcalde
Claimant ace rdingly produced the document which is the one

document it will be seen that while it has all the certifleatas
appended to it which are described in the copies filed with the
petition, still it shows to a demonstration that the copies were
neither faithful nor to the letter, as was well said by the District
Judge when his attention was first calleoto the subject. Certificate of James W. Weekes is one of the number of certificates
appended to the document. When produced it was shown to
him while he was under examination as a witness, and upon
being asked whether he had ever seen the paper before, he
answered that he had, and that the signature to the certificate
was his signature. At first be seeined to suppose that it was a
copy of what remained in the archives at that time, but immediately stated that he himself recorded it in the book of registry,
and that he received the document which he so recorded from
James Alexander Forbes. lHe was appointed Alcalde in 1848,
and he expressly states that the person before named brought
the paper to him and requested him to record it, and that he
did so while he was Alcalde. Original document was presented
'to the witness, as he states, by J. A. Forbes, and the copy was
also made by him, showing that the witness not only made the
record without any other knowledge of the paper than what he
received from his employer, but that he also signed the certificate certifying that it was "a faithful copy made to the letter
from its original," without ever having compared it with the
paper presented, and when in point of fact it was not a true
copy. Examination of James W. Weekes took place on the
18th of August, 1857, and on the 14th of December, in the same
year, James Alexander Forbes was also examined by the United
States upon .the same subject. His testimony fully confirmed
the statements of James W. Weekes that the copy was made on
the 20th day of January, 1848, and that the certificate of the
Alcalde, as well as the body of the instrument, were in his owL
handwriting, showing that all the Alcalde had to do in the
matter was to affix his signature to 'a paper already prepared.
Witness last named thinks he prepared the copy at the mine;
and he states positively that he obtained the paper which he
ased as the original from Alexander Forbes who was then at

the mine. Pressed to explain where he got certain words
appearing on the first page of the document, he frankly
admitted that he did not know, and- finally stated that he copied
the paper that was handed to him by his namesake and associate in that business. Attempts were made to impeach this
witness, but his material statements are so fully confirmed that
it is unnecessary to reproduce the evidence in that behalf.
Unmistakable proof therefore is exhibited that the adjudication
of the Commissioners was based upon documents which were
fabricated, and it follows as a necessary consequence that the
claimant, when he filed his petition, did not comply with the
provision of law which required him to present to the Commis.
sioners the documentary evidences relied on by him in support
of his claim. Those papers, strictly speaking, are denominated
the registry, the act of juridical possession and the writing of
partnerslilp, but the counsel at the bar have treated the entire
document as an espediente, ana as that is a convenient designation, it will be adopted in this investigation.
4. Espediente No. 1, called by the Attorney-General the
Weekes' espediente, must be rejected as invalid. Certain characteristics of the paper, however, should be noted in addition to
those already mentioned, in order that the other documents
subsequently introduced may be compared with it as a test of
their verity. Caption and indorsement as translated are "year
1845. Espediente of the denouncement, possession, and partnership of the quicksilver mine called Santa Clara, jurisdiction San
Jos6 Gaudalupe, in upper California." Contents are: 1. Petition of claimant announcing the discovery of a silver mine with
ley of gold. 2. Supplementary petition stating that besides silver
and gold he had taken out liquid quicksilver. 3. Act of pos
session signed by Antonio M.-Pico. 4. Receipt of same for fees
amounting to $25. 5. Writing of partnership. - Date of act of
possession is Juzgado of San JosC Gaudalupe, December 30.
1845. Articles of partnership are for a mine of silver, gold and
quicksilver, and are dated on the 2d day of November, 1845,
3ome twenty-five days before quicksilver was discovered.
Noting these characteristics as proper to be considered in

cofineetion with those previously mentioned, we dismiss the
document as wholly unworthy of credit.
5. Second e'pediente, called the Fernandez espediente by the
Attorney-General, is the one introduced by the claimant on the
6t1t day of November, 1857, when Jos6 Fernandez was examined
.4 second time as a witness. His first examination was on the
28th day of March, 1855, while the case was pending before the
Commissioners. No such espediente was exhibited then, and
no inquiries were made of the witness upon the subject. Request was made of the witness "on this last occasion to look at
the. document shown him by'the"c l inant and Bay whether he
-knew in whose -handwriting -it was, and whether the signatnres<
of Pedro Ohabolla or Chaboya apearing thereon were genuine.
Answer of witness -was, that the doeufaent was in the hand
vriting of Salvio Paeheco, and that the respective signatures of
Chabolla were 'genuine. Other docunients w~r e hen shown to
the witness, and upbn being' askeA vhether tho signatures were
,genuine, his answer N~as in the gffinnative. Thcse documents
are as follows:' 1. P1tition of Jos 'Castro, datea tia 27th dny

things, he solicits three perteencias for himse.l and associates
in addition to fhose previouisliy conceded,-and requests that the

included and archived as the party requests. '2. Claimant's two
petitions in respect to the registry of the- mihe. 3. Alcalde's
act of possession, which is dated Juzgado de San Jos6 Gaudalupe, December, - , 1845. Signatures to the act of possession
are Antonio Ma. Pico with Antonio Suffol and Jos6 Noriega as
assisting witnesses. Separate certifidates of Pedro Chaboya are
appended to each of those papers. Three of the certificates are
without date, but the one appended to the act of possession is
dated on the 13th day of August, 1846. Writing of partner.ship, so called, is wanting in the espediente, which came from
the hands' of the claimant. Although Pedro Chabolla was

examined as a witness by the claimint, still no questions were
asked him respecting this document. Testimony of Salvio Pa.
checo shows that the whole body of the instrilment is in his
handwriting, but he"omits to state from what he copied it, and
fails to give any explanation upon that subject. He says le is
acquainted with the signature of Pedro Chaboya, and that his
signatures to his certificates are genuine, but he did not see him
sign his name, and does not state how he became acquainted with
his handwriting. Signer of the'certificate testifies that he could
not write, that he could only "paint his name," and that it was
with great difficulty that, he could read any kind of writing.
Caption of the docum.nt is No. 1, and it is endorsed "Diligencias en el Registro'; Which signify that it should be promptly
registered. Receipt of Anionio Ma. Pico, as shown on espe-

diente No. 1, iswholly wanting in this document. Considering
that the signr If the certificates could not write or read writing,
and has not been. called as 'awitness to verify the document, it
is enditled to very
conideration. Circumstances, however,
will render itiieressa to recur to this paper again after refer.
ng to certain'other'documents introduced by the claimant.
6.Espediente No. 3, called by the Attorney-General the
Halleck espediente, is endorsed as filed in the case, on the
80th day of January, 1858, but it is certain that testimony
respecting it w-S ijtroduced at an earlier date. Deputy Recorder of Santa Clar* County was examined by the United States
in respect to a similar paper on the 18th day of August,
1857, but insisting upon his right to retain the document, a
traced copy of it was made, and on the twenty-ninth day of
the same month, the copy was filed in the case by the United
States.- On the 23d day of October following, another Deputy
Recorder of that Co"nty was examined by the claimant in
respect to the same or a similar document. Exhibiting a
document, entitled "Posesion de la mina St . Clara, affo de
1845," he stated that he obtained it from the office of the
Recorder. Enquiry was made of him when he went into that
office, and whether he did not, in.1852, see there the document
produced. His answers were that he had the entire charge of

the office from the fall of 1852 to the summer of 1853, but that
he had no recollection of seeing the document there during the
first year. Explanations were then given by the witness, in
which he stated that the first recollection- he had of the document was a few days before the date of the filing on the back
of the paper, which is as follows: "Filed February 25th, A. D1853, at 12 o'clock. A. M.--J. M. Murphy, Recorder, by S. 0.
Houghton, Deputy," who is the witness; and he goes on to say
that just previous to that time, James A. Forbes called at the
office of the Recorder, and after descriling the paper, desired to
seethe record of it. Search was accordingly made by the witness,
but he could find none such there, although he says that he and
the applicant searched for it more than a day. What the party.
was looking for, says the witness, was the record of the paper.
and not the paper itself,but they could find nothing of the kind,
although the search was thorough and faithful.
Unsuccessful though they were at that time, still the desired
document, in the course of a few days, was found there without
any further search; for the witness states that some days after
that, he found the paper in the office, either in the top of his
desk or one of its pigeon-holes, and he says that he was surprised that it should be there without his knowing it, but having
found it, he kept it safely until the party who inquired for it
came, and it was then filed at his request. Attention is called
by the claimant to the fact that there was written in pencil on
the back of the paper, as follows, "Filed 3 o'clock, P. M., 18
January, 1851--J. T. Richardson, Recorder, S.0. 0.," but in
view of the circumstances which surround the paper the fact
referred to cannot have much weight. Pencil marks could be
added to the filing quite as easily as the paper itself could ba
foisted into the pigeon-holes in the desk of the Recorder. Interrogatories were also propounded to H.W. Halleck in respect to
that document, and the time when it was deposited in the office
of the Recorder of Santa Clara County.
Speaking of the document, the witness said he thought it to
br the one taken by the Mayor, "in my presence," from his office,
%nd transferred to the office of the County Recorder in the

SUPREME COURT.

winter of 1851, during the session of the Legislature, and he
thought in the month of January of that year.
Recollection of witness is that .he first went to the office of
the Recorder for a copy oq the papers connected with the mine,
but was told that the greater portion of the old Alcalde papers
were in the office of the Mayor. Learning that fact, he went to
the latter office, where, on overhauling certain old papers in an
old desk, he found this one among them. Witness, as he states,
only remembers the papers he found there from the general
subject-matter of il i contents, as purporting to be an original
paper, containing the denouncement and juridical possession of
the mine. Document embracing a copy of espediente, number
one, was shown to the witness, and he was asked whether it was
not a copy of the one he found in the office of the Mayor; to
which he answered, that he could not remember whether it coiltained the same papers as that, more ori less. Obviously the
recollections of the witness upon the subject are very imperfect
and indistinct, and consequently his statements are so qualified
and so far short of positive declarations that they can hardly be
regarded .,s evidence. Indistinct, however, as the recollections
Df the witnebs are, still it is evid nt that he regards the paper as
the original denouncement and juridical possession of the mine,
because he says so in answer to the direct interrogatory put to
him by the United States, but his opinion in that behalf cannot
be- regarded as satisfactory proof of the fact, especially when
considered in connection with his previous answers as to his
means of knowledge and the state of his recollections.
7. Those interested in the mine could not have believed on the
13th day of December, 1850, that any such original document,
or duly authenticated copy thereof, was in the State of California,
as is evident from the affidavit of their counsel, signed and sworn
to on that day. Suit had been commenced in the County Court;
by the widow and heirs of Jos6 Reyes Berreyesa, against all of
the persons in possession Qf the mine, to recover possession of a
certain tract of land, including that in which the mine.was situ
ated. Defendants were Isidoro de la Torre, of Mazatlan; Alexander Forbes, William Barron, and Eustacho Barron, of Tepic,

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United tates vs. Andres (astillero.
John Parrot, of San Francisco; and James A. Forbes, and Robert
Walkinshaw of the County of Santa Clara. Court granted a
rule on the 13th of September, 1850, requiring defendants to
produce "certain papers or copies thereof," to be used in the
trial of that cause. Among those specified in the motion were
certain papers of a pretended denouncement of the mine in 1845.
Papers were not produced, and the affidavit of the counsel was
ified to support a motion for a continuance. Affidavit stated to
the effect that the original denouncement of the mine of New
Almaden, and the act of juridical possession given of the same
in the year 1845, were held by parties in Mexico, which had not
then been received, although the defendants had exercised all
due diligence to procure and produce them.
Referring to the contents of this espediente, it will be seen
that it contains: 1. Petition of Jos6 Castro, already described.
2. Petitions of claimant. 3. Alcalde's act of possession.
None of the certificates exhibited in the other espedientes are
to be found in this document. Testimony was adduced to show
that the several .papers were genuine, and the witnesses most
relied on for that purpose were Jos6 Castro, Antonio Ma. Pico,
together with Antonio Sufol and Jos6 Noriega, the two assisting witnesses to the act of possession. Full proof was exhibited
that io one of the papers was written by the person or persons
who signed it, and it was satisfactorily shown that each paper
was in a handwriting different from all the rest. Satisfactory
proof also was exhibited that the petition of Jos6 Castro was in
the handwriting of Benito Diaz, and he testified that he wrote it
1ve or six months after our conquest of that Department.
Writing of partnership, and the receipt of Pico for his fees are
both wanting in this document. Caption of the document is:
"Posesion de la Mina de Sta. Clara, aifo de 1845," and the act
of possession is dated Juzgado de San Jos6 Guadalupe, December -, 1845.

on the 10th day of November of the same year, shows nci trace
of any such paper. Testimony of H. C. Melone should also be
noticed in this connection, as he was the first clerk of the Alcalde's Court, under our military occupation. His statement is.
that he never saw the document or heard it spoken of, although
he had occasion to examine the papers there, one by one, in order
to select such as should go to the office of the Recorder from such
as he was required to keep as county clerk.
9. Fourth espediente is the one called the Walkinshaw espediente by the Attorney-General, and is the last of the series
introduced by the claimant, as the documentary evidences of
his title, to the mine and mining right, or privilege described in
his petition. Contents of the espediente are as follows: 1. Petitions of the claimant, as in the first espediente. Appended to
each is also a certificate of Pedro Ohabolla, dated the 13th of
January, 1846, certifying that the petitions respectively were
copies of originals, and each certificate purports to have been
signed in the presence of P. Sansevan and Jose Sufol, as assisting witnesses. 3. Pico's receipt for twenty-five dollars as fees.
Introductory part of the receipt corresponds to that in the first
espediente, but he also describes the mine as one "in lands pertaining to Don Josg Reyes Berreyesa." Castro's petition and the
writing of partnership are both wanting, and there is no certificate of Pedro Chabolla appended to the act of possession or any
certificate of any kind. Another peculiarity of this document
consists in its caption, and as that part of the paper is of con
siderable importance in the investigation, it will be given without abbreviation. It is as follows:

P~artnership of the quicksilver mine is one of the matters
enumerated in the title of the caption, and the writing of partnership is one of the documents circumstantially described in
the last article of the same. Espediente produced, contains no
such paper, and the inference is a very strong one that it has
been spoliated by some one having an interest to suppress the
missing paper. Description of the paper, as exhibited in the
last article of the caption, gives the date as of the 8th day of
December, 1845, which is a very material variation from the
other copies y'resented in this record. Discovery that the mineral coitained quicksilver, notwithstanding what is stated in the
articlks of partnership, was not made until late in November,
1845, after the claimant returned from Sutter's Fort. Articles
of partnership, as exhibited in the first espediente, were dated
before the quicksilver was discovered, and yet the discovery, as
set forth in ihat document, was described as of a mine of silver,
gold, and quicksilver, which inconsistency *tended strongly to
impair confidence in the entire espediente. Petition had been
pending nearly eight years when -this espediente found its way
into this case. First espediente was filed on the 30th day of
Septeihber, 1852, and this one was filed on the 17th day of July,
1860. Time enough, certainly, had elapsed to 6nable a party
to examire and ascertain what, if any, contradictions or incon.
sistencies appeared in his proofs, and to give him an opportunity
to employ all proper means to obviate any such difficulty. Pro.

it must be held that the burden of proof is upon the party producing it, not only to establish the authenticity of the paper,
but to do so by clear and satisfactory evidence. On the 27th
of July, 1860, Pedro Chabolla was examined in respedt to this
espediente. In quiry was made of him, whether his signature
and those of the assisting witnesses were genuine, and upon
looking at the document, he answered both questions in the
affirmative, although he admitted, in the same deposition, that
he never learned to write, and that-it was with difficulty that he
could "psint his name." His account of the maatter was, that
the papers-were brought to him from the mine; amdihe says he
signed them because he was ,requested to.do so; and ten asked
how he knaw the papers ware correct, Ifis answer vwas that he
did not examine them, ad$liig that "it vwas not a me to do
,hat." One efftthe assisting witnesses, Jos Suaol, is (dead; but
the other, Pedro Sansevan, was examined, and eonfirms the
statements of *e preceding-aftness as to ihe genuineness of the
signatures; but ttwo witnesses (xamined Ily the United States,
testified, without qualification, taat the witness had previously
stated to them that he signed the documents in the year 1848,
and that they were copies.
Theory of claimant now is, that oespediente 1Wo. 3 is the original filed in office, and that the espediente under consideration
was a duplicate executed at the same time and delivered to the
party. Three witnesses, Antonio Ma. Pico, Antonio Suffol, and
Jos6 Noriega, were recalled and examined to prove that the
document was executed in duplicate: They stated nothing of
the kind in their first examination, nor did'they do so in their
second depositions. When called for the third time, after the
foarth espediente had been discovered and introduced, the
witness first named said that the document was signed on the
day of its date, and he had no doubt he delivered it to the
claimant; but the other two witnesses were less positive, and
were only able to say that they supposed the document was
sigihed at its date. Learned counsel admit that the theory in
this behalf was started at rather a late stage in the investiga-.
tion, but endeavor to excuse the claimant upon the ground tha

The United States -vs. Andres Castillero.
the fact was unknown to, his attornies, and that his witnesses did
not remember it. Attorneys are certainly without fault, and so
are the witnesses, unless they have finally attempted to remember
what never occurred, which, from all the eircunstances, there is
too much reason to fear.
Parties holding large and valuable interests in real estate are
generally careful to secure title papers which are supposed to be
correct in form, and their solicitude and vigilance in preserving
them are more or less active, according to their importance
and the magnitude of the interest involved. Contrary to what
might have been expected, as shown by experience, the claimant in this case, and those holding under him lost all the origioal title papers to the mine, although the espediente, as they
allege, had been executed in duplicate, and the mine and mining
right or privilege were of incalculable value and importance.
Fortuitous circumstances artistically described in the testimony,
led, it seems , according to !he theory of the claimant, to the discovery of the third espediente, called byTis counsel the original,
in the depository where-it belonged, and where every one who
made any enquiries upon..the subject must have known that the
papers of the Alcalde's office had been deposited.
10. Impressions still prevailed, as the claimant represents, in
the minds of those interested in the mine that there was somewhere in existence a duplicate original, but all enquiries and
search for it:had proved ineffectual until the time when the
fourth espediente was discovered under the extraordinary cir
cumstances detailed in the record. Those circumstances arc
well described by the witness, Thomas Bell; and inasmuch as
they were even more fortuitous than those unde which the
third espediente was discovered, it may be well to allow the
witness to state them in his own language Ile was examined on
the 17th of July, 1860, the day this last espediente was filed.
Witness says:
Some time, about three weeks ago, at the request of Mr. Billings, I was looking for the documents relating to the barras in the
m~ine of New Almaden, which at one time had belonged to Padra
Real; not fwiding one of the documents which I was m search

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Ca& llero.
of among the papers of the mine, I asked Mr. Young to get the
box containing the papers relating to the estate of Walkinshaw
to see if it could not be found there. He produced the box,
and then we proceeded to overhaul the papers. I saw a bundle
marked-" Papers relating to the disputed barra," which I
opened, and in looking over these papers I found one endorsed
"Titles of Mines." I was struck with the antique appearance
of the paper, and knowing that it was suspected that Walkinshaw had had documents relating to the Almaden mine in his
possession, after glancing over the papers, I took them to the
office of Messrs. Peachy and Billings, to ascertain more particularly their nature. It was then discovered that it was an
espediente which they had. been anxious to obtain for a long
time.
Explanation of the transaction as given by the claimant is,
that Robert Walkinshaw, the undisputed owner of two shares in
the mine, brought suit against Bolton, Barron & Co., to establish
his right to a third share claimed by him on which the defend
ants refused to pay him dividends. He employed counsel and
gave him certain papers which the counsel, who is now one of
the counsel in the case, retained in his possession from January,
1853, when he was employed to bring the suit, until May, 1858,
when he returned them to his client who gave him a receipt for
the papers. Receipt is dated on the 14th of May, 1858, and the
first paper named in it is a document in Spanish, headed "Ano
de 1845, Espediente de denuncio posesion y compaffia de la Mina
de A ,ogue nombrado Santa Clara, jurisdicion de St. Jos6 Guadalupe, en la Alta California." Five pages writing and certificate,
endorsed "Titles of Mine."
Day after the date of that receipt the party signing it sailed for
Scotland, where, in the following August, he died. Document
remained among the effects of the deceased in the care of his
son-in-law and the executor of his estate until it was brought to
notice in the manner already described.
Deposition of the son-in-law, who was the executor of the
estate, was also taken by the claimant. Ile confirmed the state.
ment of the preceding witness, but adds that he had previousll

The United Staes vs. Andres Jastillero.
examined the papers of the deceased in search of documents
relating to the title of the Almaden mine without any such
success. Where the box had been kept, and whether so situated
as to be accessible to other persons or not, the witness does not
state; but he does state that the decedent before he left the
country, handed him the documents found in the bundle, and
that he enveloped them "in a piece of paper" and labelled the
envelope.
His search on the fomer occasion, as the witness admits, was
especially directed to find the testimonio of the act of juridical
possession, but he made no such discovery at that time. First
search, as in the matter of the third espediente, was unsuccessful, but the second was attended with no difficulty. Such a
discovery at that stage of the controversy was doubtless thought
to be an acquisition as valuable as it was unexpected, and if the
document could be regarded as an "authentic paper, free from
suspicion, the claimant and those holding under him, in one
aspect of the case, might well be of the opinion that its import.
ance could hardly be over estimated.
Assuming the other espedientes to be genuine, still the evidence in regard to them, even if viewed according to the theory
of the claimant, showed conclusively that article 4, title 6, of the
Mining Qrdinance had not been complied with, because it was
conceded that no attested copy of the proceedings had been
delivered to the acquirer of the mine as "a corresponding title."
When he filed his petition before the Commissioners, he also
filed copies of the first espediente. Both the copies and the
original, subsequently produced, represented that the act of juridical possession contained the day of the month on Which it was
executed, and besides the document embraced the receipt of the
Alcalde for his fees and two certificates of Pedro Chabolla dated
on the 13th of January, 1846, appended to the two petitions of
the claimant. Those particulars were all wanting in the respec
tive documents subsequently introduced. Favorable adjudica.
tion under such a state of facts could not rationally be expected,
unless these glaring inconsistencies could be explained, because
their effect was not only to impair all confidence in those dou-

ments, but also to, discredit all the witnesses who, under oath,
had verified the first espediente and the several papers of which
it was composed.
Mention is made of these circumstances as showing the urgent
necessity there was for additional proof and the corresponding
induement to commit fraud by fabrication and forgery. Counsel
of the claimant admit in their brief that from the time James A.
Forbes was examined as a witness in relation to the first espediente, until May or June, 1860, it remained inexplicable,
whence came the word thirty in the date of the firA. copy of
the. act of juridical possession, whence came the copy of the
receipt of the Alcalde for his fees, and whence came the copy
of the two certificates of Pedro Chabolla which follow the
respective petitions of the claimant. All these were found in
the copy produced and, filed as the first espediente, and up to
that time had been treated by the claimant as parts of a genuine
document. "Whence they came," say the counsel, "was the
mystery," but their theory is, that the mystery was solved by
what they now call the duplicate copy of the act of juridical
po-ssession, and in support of the theory they suggest, that it
nad long been supposed that such a copy must have been delivered by the Alcalde to the claimant. Suggestions were also
made as to the mode in which Robert Walkinshaw might have
become possessed of the supposed original document; but it is
a sufficient answer to all these suggestions to say that they are
founded on mere conjecture, are not supported by the evidence,
and have little or no foundation in the probabilities of the case.
Production of that espediente, say the counsel. "furnished the
means of bringing in the testimony of all the witnesses concerned in (its) preparation who were yet living." Accordingly
those witnesses whio were called for the third time and reexarminled, and although in their former depositions they had
uniformly spoken of the espediente supposed to have been executed before the Alcalde in the singular number, without any
intimation in respect to a duplicate, yet at last, after the petition
had been pending nearly eight years, they were, as thoy state,
able to recollect that a duplicate was executed at the same time

The United States vs. Andres (astillero.

and delivered to the claimant, but their recollections upon the
subject are by no means as distinct as thd*were on a former
occasion they testified to the effect that the'1frs -espediente was
a genuine document. Such testimony under tfie'eircumstances,
is not entitled to credit, and such theories as those set up in
respect to the supposed existence, loss and discovery of the
third and fourth espedientes as genuine original documents
are too speculative, sound too much in fiction,4rd are too thoroughly saturated with improbability to receive: credence in a
Court of Justice.
11. Frequent reference is made by the claimant in this connection to the evidene -adduced as to the proceedings of the
Junta de Fomento and other Departments of the Supreme Government, as tending to confirm the testimony introduced to prove
the genuineness of these documents, and it may be conceded that
the evidence referred to has some indirect bearing in that direction, but it must be-borne in mind that no one of those docu.
ments, nor any part thereof, was ever submitted to those Deiartments, or to any one of them, and it is by no means certain that
the officers of those Departments, or any one of them, ever heard
that any such documents had-been executed. They had doubt.
less heard what the claimant had stated in his communication
to the Junta de Fomento, bat there is no evidence to show that
they had ever heard any thing more than that in respect to any
of' the suppoged proceedings of the local authorities upon that
subject. lNone of the documents were presented to them by the
claimant, and ,ifcourse there could have been no action in

respect to their genuineness, which is the question now under
consideration. Arguments which confound the question as to
the genuineness of the documents, supposed to have been executed before the Alcalde, with the question of confirmation by
the Home Government, afford very little aid- in the decision of
the case, and, in point of fact, are entitled to no weight, because
their effect, if any, is to mislead.
Strong, however, as our impressions -are that the evidence
fails to show that any one of the four espedientes, introduced by
the claimant, is entitled to credit, still we are disinclined, in vieli

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
of the great complication ot the evidence upon the subject, to
rest the decision of the case upon that ground.
VI.Two other principal objections are made to the confirmation of the claim:
First. It is insisted by the United States, that it is not shown
by competent evidence, that a public tribunal, empowered by
law to take jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the acquisition of a mine, or mining right, or privilege, has ever acted in
this case, and adjudicated to the claimant the title to the mine,
as alleged by him in the petition.
Secondly. That if such a tribunal is shown by competent evidence to have taken any action in the case, 'still it does not
exercise its special and limited jurisdiction in a manner required
by law so as to constitute or evidence any title to the mine
claimed by the petitioner.
1. Mines under Mexican laws, as before explained, whether
situated in public or private lands, belong to the Supreme Government, and private persons can only acquire a title in one not
previously discovered and made individual property according to
law, by conforming substantially to the conditions ordained in the
provisions of the 4th article of the mining ordinance as herein
previously recited. Applicant must resort to the proper tribunal
and present his written statement, specifying init his name and
the names of his partners, if he has any, the place of their birth,
their residence, profession and employment, and the most particular and distinguishing features of the place, hill or vein, of which
he asks adjudication. The title to such properties are acquired
by the citizen or subject wherever Spanish law prevails by the
adjudication of the proper tribunal having jurisdiction of the
subject-matter. Contrary to what is supposed by the claimant
is the adjudication,or decree, of the proper tribunal in a case
duly presented for decision, and the registry of the adjudication
together with the proceedings on which it is founded, which vest
the title in the applicant, and not the mere fact of discovery as
was supposed at the argument. Without proof of discovery by
the applicant, there can be no adjudication in his favor, but the
discovery of a mine, by a party in whose favor there has been

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
Tie United States vs. Andres Castillero.
no adjudition by a tribunal having jurisdiction of the subjectmatter, secures no right or title to the discoverer. Boundaries
also must be fixed to carry the adjudication into effect or rather
to compete it, else the title or claim, like other indefinite and
uncertain interests in lands, will be void for uncertainty. Marking of boundaries also is essential under all circumstances,
whether the mine is situated in public or private lands, for if
the location is in public lands, compliance with the requirement
is essential to show what extent of the public domain has been
segregated from the mass of such lands and has passed into private owneiship.
2. Public convenience, therefore, in such a case requires that
the boundaries should be fixed, and, besides, unless the limits
of the pertenencia were fixed and staked, or monuments set, other
tribunals, whbse duty it is to adjudicate lands to applicants for
agricultural purposes, would be subjected to embarrassment and
be led into errory: Definite limits also to mining rights or privileges are equally necessary and important, where the same
happen to be located upon the lands of private individuals,
in order that the land owner, as contradistinguished from the
owner of the mine, may have the means of knowing and be judicially notified, as to what portion of his land has been condemned and appropriated to the use of another.
3. Registry, also, is expressly required by the very article of
the mining ordinance under which the party in this case claims
title to the mine, and it is a great error to suppose that a compliance with that provision is shown by proving that sheets of
paper, not executed at the same time, but assumed to constitute
an espediente, were at some time placed in the office of th3
Alcalde and remained there for a time in one of the pigeonholes of his desk. Such a suggestion is destitute of any foundation. On the contrary, the requirement is in express terms that
the statement of the discoverer, together with the time when he
presented hin self, "shall be noted in a book of registry,which the
deputation and notary, if there be oae, shall keep, and in respect
to the action of the tribunal on the appication, the provision is
Ohat an exact account shall be tal-en" in order that itmay be

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
added to the corresponding part of the registry with the evidence
of possession, which shall immediately be given. Act of possession, therefore, is to be added to the registry, together with the
action of the tribunal on making the adjudication; an& they are
both required to be noted in a book (Libro) of registry.
4. Strict compliance with that provision is required as matter
of public policy, because the mines of a country like Mexico are
a great sources of revenue to the Government, and because it
tends to prevent disputes and litigation; prevent fraud and false
swearing; secure such rights of property, and promote order and
a good understanding among miners holding and working contiguous pertenencias. 1 Gamboa per HI., pp. 143, 144.
The tribunal empowered by the mining ordinance to exercise
this jurisdiction was "the Deputation of Mining" for the territory or district where the mine was situated, or the nearest one
thereto, should there be none there. Halleck Coll. 224. Former
ordinances, especially that of 1584, on which Gamboa wrote, conferred the power of adjudicating such titles exclusively on the
Mining Court within whose jurisdiction the mine was situated.
Ord. 1584, art. 17, Gamboa per H., 139. Section 17th of that
Ordinance also provided "that in case such registry be not made
in the manner, and within the prescribed time, any person may
register such mine, and shall thereby have and acquire the right
which such discoverer or other person who might have required
the registry, would have had if he had caused the registry to be
made." Gamboa, p. 141.
5. Cases occurred under that Ordinance where mines were discovered in districts having no Mining Court.. and in that state of
the case there was n6 tribunal in the parent country which had
jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and of course the matter had
to be referred to the sovereign power, and to remedy the embarrassment arising under such circumstances from the want of a
court to adjudicate such titles, it was provided, in the mining
Ordinance of 1783, that the court "nearest thereto" should have
jurisdiction of such a case. Parties concede that the ordinance
last named was in force at the date of these proceedings, and
unless it can be shown, (and the burden is upon him who avers

it.) that the provision referred to has been modified or repealed,
it is clearly applicable to this case. Constitution of Mexico
vested all the judicial powers of the Republic in one Supreme
Court of Justice, and other courts and tribunals to be constituted
in conformity to the instrument. Coll. Mexican Constitutio .
tomo 1, titulo 5, art. 123. Pursuant to that provision the Tribunal-General of Mining, on the 20th of May, 1826, was deprived
of its powers. New regulations were then adopted, which were
from time to time. amended, but it is not important to notice
those decrees, because on the 2d day of December, 1842, a new
system, carefully digested, was put in force, the 4th article of
which constituted and regulated the tribunals of mining. Halleck Col., pp. 409, 424, 434, 441.
Among other things it provides for the creation of "Courts of
the First Instance" in each Department, and for the mode of the ;,
election, and also provides that those courts, within their respe
tive districts, shall exercise the executive, judicial, and econon: i
cal powers given by the old ordinance. Halleck Coil. p. 441
title"4, art. 26.
6. Courts of the First Instance were never organized in tho
Department of California, and the argument of the claimant is,
that in consequence of that fact the ordinary tribunals, as for
example, an Alcalde could take jurisdiction over sulcb. a subject.
matter, and on the application of the discoverer, could adjudicate the title. But the position cannot bb sustained, because by
the express law of the Republic, as evidence in the special decree
of the 14th of January, 1843, it is provided that territorial deputations may continue to exercise their functions "until the Courts
of First Instance * * are established." Halleck Coil., p..443.
Support to the positioh cannot be derived, as is supposed, from
the fact that the law was'so in some of the dependencies of Spain
prior to 1783, because it is from the express terms of the Ordinance of that year that the Mining Deputation derived their
exclusive jurisdiction over the subject, and inasmuch as the
supposed analogy on which the position was based fails, the.
position must fall with it.

Department, afford strong grbund to conclude that no such power
was intended to be conferred upon any of the officers of the
Local Government. Those officers were a Governor, appointed
by th!. Supreme Government, a Departmental Assembly, consisting ot seven members, who were chosen by electors, but their
election was subject to the approval of the Home Government.
Most of the important functions of the Local Government
were purformed by the Governor and the Departmental Assembly but the law also made provision for the appointment of
Prefects, who were to be nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the General Government; also, Sub-Prefects, who were
to be nominated by the Prefects and approved by the Governor.
Provision was also made for Ayuntamientos or Municipal Councils, whose ordinary members were elective; and also for the
appointment of Alcaldes and Juaces de Paz or Justices of the
Peace, whose numbers were to be fixed "by the Departmental
Assembly, in concurrence with the Governor."' Arrillaga, Recop.,
pp. 202, 214, 223, 230. Judicial functions were exercised by the
Prefect as well as the Alcalde, and no reason is perceived for
holding that the latter could adjudicate a mining title which
might not be adduced with equal and even greater force to show
that the same important duty might be performed by the Prefect;
but the truth is, there was no law which gave either the one or
the other any pretence of jurisdiction in any such matter
Theory of claimant is, and so is the argument, that the jurisdiction must have been confided to some of the officers of the
Department, and that the presumption is, that the Alcalde had
jurisdiction, inasmuch as it is not shown that Courts of First
Instance had been constituted and organized.
Giving the argument, however, its utmost force, it only shows
that a law ccnferring upon an Alcalde such a jurisdiction would
have been a convenience to the inhabitants, and especially to
the claimant; but it has no tendency to show there was any such
law, which is the question to be decided. Opinion is expressed
by two or three of claimant's witnesses that an Alcalde might
make such an adjudication, but they exhibit no law to that
effect, nor do they attempt to prove there was any such general

DEIOEMBFR TERM,.U862.

usage; and inasmuch as their opinions are not c6mpetent evizience, their testimony may ue dismissed without further remark.
Authorities of Mexico had long dreaded the influence of foreigners in that Department, and althQugh the policy of the Home
Government was to promotethe settlement and growth of the
Department, still they had always manifested an unwillingness
to confer any more power upon the Local Government than was
necessary to accomplish those objects.
Mineral wealth, if discovered, would furnish a motive to
attempt the conquest of the Department, and it may well be
inferred that the authorities of the Home Government had determined to reserve the adjudication of titles to such important
public interests to the Federal tribunals. Strong support to that
view of the case is derived from the course pursued by those
authorities wh ir the land system of the Department was devised
and put into operation.
'8. Power to grant vacant lands was as early as the 18th of
August, 1824, vested in the Governor, in concurrence with the
Departmental Assembly. Additional regulations upon the subject were adopted on the 21st of November, 1828, which exhibit
a system as complete and perfect as is to be found anywhere.
Granting vacant lands for agricultural purposes was by nd means
regarded as a matter of so much public importance, as the adjudication of titles to newly discovered mines. Those provilions
and regulations confer very ample power upon the Governor to
grant vacant lands in. concurrence with the Departmental Assembly, but they confer no power upon them or upon any of the
local authorities to adjudicate titles to mines. Grants of land
made under those laws did not convey to the grantee the unsevered. minerals in the soil or any interest in them, and there is no
ground whatever to hold 'that the Supreme Government ever
conferred upon any of the local tribunals any jurisdiction upon
the subject under consideration. Authority of the Alcalde
therefore, cannot -be inferred from the fact of its exercise, or from
the fact that no other tribunal of the Department was autho,

VII. But if the Alcalde had power to take jurisdicti6n of the

subject-matter, still it is insisted by the United States in the
second place that he had only a special and limited authority,
and that he did not exercise it in the manner required by law.
1. His proceedings were based upon the written statement of the
claimant, and that was upon its face exceedingly imperfect if not
absolutely insufficient. Some of the provisions of the mining
ordinance are doubtless merely directory, others may be regarded as conditions subsequent, but-those appertaining to the
registry of the mine, together with the action of the tribunal
thereon, and in respect to the juridical possession of the same.
are evidently conditions precedent; so that it is necessary, in
order tG support a title to such a right or privilege as a discoverer, to show that the party substantially performed those
conditions. Unless a claimant shows a substantial compliance
with those requirements the conclusion is inevitable, not that he
has forfeited his right to the mine, but that he never acquired
any such title. Forfeiture is of that which a party hath, but he
cannot be said to have forfeited what he never had acquired, as
the title to that which he had never acquired, must always have
been in the State or in another person.
2. Nothing like forfeiture is pretended by the United States,
and no such question arises in the case; but the proposition is,
that the claimant never acquired any right or privilege in the
mine even if he was the discoverer, because he did not, as required by law, pursue the necessary steps to give vitality to the
inchoate privilege or pre-emption accorded to the discoverer to
proceed according to law, and ripen such privilege or pre-emption into a perfect or complete right by a registry of that which
he had discovered before the proper tribunal, and by securing
the juridical possession of the same under a legal adjudication
of the title. 4is discovery, and its registration, as is well said
by the counselfof the United States, gave him a. right, within
ninety days to make an opening into the vein, and the further
right to apply to the proper public authority and have that
which he claimed to have discovered defined and set out to him
and its boundaries marked, .and a record made of his title to the
defined pertenencias. When all this is done according to law,

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

197

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

the inchoate privilege or pre-emption of a discoverer so to proceed is then ripened into a perfect or complete right, and his
title to the mine comes into existence.
3. Returning to the written statement which in this case is the
petition of the claimant addressed to the Alcalde, and noting the
representations it contains, it is clear that it is not a compliance
with the requirements of the ordinance in many respects. . Ordinance, for example, requires a written statement of the most
particular and distinguishing features of the place, hill, or vein
of which adjudication is asked, or of which he asks the grant, as
the phrase is rendered in some of the translations. Representation in the statement or petition is, that he, the* claimant, has
discovered a vein of silver with a ley of gold "on the rancho of
Jos6 Reyes Berreyesa, which wps a hacienda of a league square,
mostly table land, with disputed boundaries." Another require-"
ment of the ordinance is, that the applicant shall give "the
names of his partners, if he has any, and the place of their birth,
their residence, profession, and employment;" and by article
6, f title 7, the discoverer is expressly forbidden to denounce a
mine for himself having entered into a contract of partnership,
and yet the claimant's petition which shows that there was a
partnership, fails to disclose the names of his partners or any of
the required particulars, and it also shows that he deuounced
the mine to himself alone..
4. Strong doubts are entertained whether the Alcalde, even
if he had jurisdiction of the subject-matter, was authorized to
proceed and adjudicate the title upon the basis of such a
statement; but it is not necessary to decide that question, as
there are two other defects in the proceedings which are fatal to
the piretensions of the claimant. No such registry of the particulars concerning the mine, or of the action of the Alcalde upon the
allegations of the petition, or of his proceedings in respect to the
juridical possession of the mine was ever made, as is requited
by the provisions of the ordinance, nor were the pertenencias
met..,red or definitely located, or the boundaries fixed, or the
stakes set, as is therein required. Registry has been required

viled for more than three centuries, and probably no case ever
occurred within that period which more fully showed the abso.
lute necessity for such a rule or more 'fully exemplified its
wisdom than the case under consideration.
When the Alcalde was first called and examined in another
suit concerning the proceedings before him, in respect to the
registry of this mine, and the supposed juridical possession given
of the same, he testified that the claimant applied to him to go
and give him possession of the mine, according to the Mexican
custom. Taking the account of the matter, as he then gave it,
to be true, he went there with the claimant and others, and
pointed out such boundaries as he thought the claimant ought
to have; but he expressly stated, on that occasion, "that no fixed
possession was given to him," fQr the reason that there was a
dispute between him and Jos6 Reyes Berreyesa, on whose rancho
the mine was situated.
Berreyesa, as the witness stated, would not consent that poisession should be given unless the claimant would admit that
he, Berreyesa, should have an interest in the mine, and as the
claimant would not do that, he, the witness, did not give any
fixed possession of the mine. Witness was three times examined
in this case, and on two of the occasions, he was interrogated
upon this subject. His statements areto the effect that he, with
the claimant and others, went to.4he mine; that after they
arrived there, he sent for Jos6 Reyes Berreyesa, the proprietor
of the Rancho, and that he accordingly came to the mine; that
he, the witness, made known to Berreyesa what it was that
was proposed to be done; that. at first he objected, but finally
consented, and that he, the witness, delivered the possession to
the claimant. They made no survey, fixed no boundaries, and
set no stakes, and the witness expressly states that he had no
idea whether the three thousand varas in all directions were to
be laid out in a square or round; that a part of the tract only
was to be located around the mine, and the residue on the public
domain in that neighborhood.
6. Nothing was done on the land; and if the witness is to be
believed, very little was said, except that he stated that he

delivered the three thousand varas in all directions to the claim
ant. During the examination he was reminded of his former
statements upon that subject, and was requested to explain the
differences, but his answer was that, according to his understand.
ing, there was no contradiction between his testimony then given
and the statement in the act of possession. Alcalde Antonio
M- Pico had a secretary by the name of Jos6 Fernandez, who.
was a witness in this case, and who was also the escibano of the
Court, but the Padre Real expressed a wish that these documents,
whatever they were, should be prepared by one Gutierrez, a
teacher at the Mission of Santa Clara, which was a league or two
from the Juzgado of San Jos6 Guadalupe. They were not, therefore, prepared by the Secretary of the Court, and all he knowg
upon the subject is, that two or three days after the party returned
from the mine, the schoolmaster, Gutierrez, brought him the
document, and said, "there, now, it is all finished, and here is
your fee," giving him three dollars and a half,and "so," in the
language of the witness, "the document remained in the Court,"
butrhe expressly states that he never read it, or examined it
and when asked by the United States what he did with it, he
answered: "It remained there in Court.. I did nothing else
with it."
Other witnesses were examined upon these topics, but the
statement given contains the substance of the evidence on both;
and all the wiinesses agree that there was no survey, no stakes
set, and no boundaries marked inany manner. On this state of
the case, it is insisted by the United States, that the acts of the
Alcalde were absolutely void, but the claimant insists that even
conceding the irregularities to have been such as represented,
'still that the acts of the Alcalde were not absolutely void, but
at most only voidable, and that they were afterwards ratified
and confirmed by the Supreme Government.
7. Reliance, it is proper to remark, is placed by the clai mant
upon the evidence of ra ification, as affording a sufficient and
complete answer to all the objections taken to the claim made
by him to the mine. Examination of that evidence, as exhibited
in the 3opies of documents, introduced as true copies I original

The United States vs. Andres Gastillero.

on file in the Departments of the Supreme Government, has
already been so fully made that a brief reference to it in this
stage of the investigation will be sufficient.
Statement of the claimant in his communication to the Junta
de Fomento is, that he had discovered a mine of quicksilver in
the Mission of Santa Clara; that he had denounced and taken
possession, not only of the mine, but also of an extent of three
thousand varas in all directions, that he had formed a company
to work it, had constructed the pit, and had complied with all the
conditions' prescribed by the ordinance. Required, as he was,
to make the representation in writing, it was of course prepared
with deliberation; and yet he falsely states that the mine is
situated "in the Mission of Santa Clara," and suppresses alto.
gether the fact stated in his petition, and repeated in the act of
possession, that the mine was situated on the rancho of Jos6
Reyes Berreyesa.
He refers to none of the documents, and none were produced,
and this remark applies as well to his seventh proposition as to
his representations in the preliminary part of his communication
to the Junta. They adopted his seventh proposition, and recommended to the President, through the Minister of Justice, that
the possession given to the claimant by the local authorities, as
he represented, should be confirmed. Two accounts are given,
as to what was the action of the President on the occasion.
First, in the dispatch of the Minister of Justice, and secondly,
in that of the Minister of Relations.
In the first, the language is, that the President "has been
pleased to approve in all its parts the agreement made with (the
claimant) in order to commence the working of said mine ;" and in
the second, the language is the same, except that the purpose
of the agreement, as describel, was "to commence the explorafion
.f that mine." Neither the one or the other contains a word
which, by any proper construction, can be held to confirm the
acts of the local authorities, or any of them, or to vest in the
claimant any right, title, or interest in the mine. None of the
documents, executed by the Alcalde were before the President,
and it does not appear that be ever heard of them in any other

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

201

The UniZed States vs. Andres Castillero.

manner than by those vague representations, or others of a
similar character. Action of the President evinces caution and
circumspection, and the several communications, taken together
clearly show that he did not act at all upon the seventh proposition of the claimant, or upon his representations in respect to
the juridical possession of the mine; and there is nothing in the
marginal order in any respect inconsistent with this view of the
case, as it is evident that the purpose and intent of that order
was accomplished in the contemporaneous dispatch of the Minister of Justice. Credence was evidently given to the represen.
tations that a mine had been discovered, and the President was.
willing that an advance of $5,000 or $6,000 should be made to
the claimant to enable him to connence its exploration. Direc-tions were accordingly given to approve the agreemcnt to that
extent, and to make the advance and furnish the retorts and
other apparatus therein mentioned.
8. Second grants of land in the Department of California
were seldom made by the Governors, and as the claimant already
had one, he could hardly expect to obtain another without the
special approbation of the Supreme Government. Hence his
eighth proposition that a grant should be made to him, "as a
colonist," which was 9pproved by the President so far as appears
in the dispatch of the Minister of Relations already explained.
Grants of that description conveyed no interest in the minerals,
as was well known to the claimant; and in respect to the eighth
proposition, thb President was silent, evidently reserving that
matter for further information and a more deliberate considera.
tion. Irrespective, therefore, of the question of fraud, we are
of the opinion that, by the true construction of the several
communications, .the claimant fails to show that the acts of the
Alcalde have in any manner been ratified or confirmed by the
Supreme Government.
It is clear, therelore, that the respective documents executed
before the Alcalde must stand or fall, by what appears in the
ilastruments, when considered in connection with the evidence,
showing what was lone at the time of their execution. Conceding
fill credit to the i.itnesses, and giving the utmost scope to thei,

testimony consistent with the language employed, still it is
obvious from the claimant's own showing that he never made
any registry of the mine, within the meaning of the provision
requiring it to be made. Such a document cannot be said to
have been registered; merely because it was handed to the
Secretary of the Alcalde, before whom it was executed, and
was for a time somewhere in the courthouse, especially when it
appears that it was subsequently abstracted from the depository,
if such it may be called, and was not returned to it for years
afterwards, and then clandestinely and under circumstances of
the greatest suspicion. Constrained as we are to regard the
facts in point of view, the conclusion is inevitable that there was
no legal registry of the mine, and the evidence is all one way
to show that there was no survey of the nine hundred pertenen.
cias granted, and no boundaries were fixed, and no stakes were
set as required in the ordinance. Assuming," therefore, that the
Alcalde had jurisdiction over the subject-matter, still, as it was
but a special-and limited authority, in order -to give any validity
to his acts he must exercise it in the manner required by law,
and not having done so, his acts are void. U. S. vs. Osio, 23
How., p. 283; U. S. vs. Castillero, 23 How., p. 466.
VIII. Conduct of claimant throughout shows that he knew
that he had no title as is plainly to be inferred from the fact that
in the several conveyances made by him he never referred to
the registry of the mine or to the acts of juridical possession
supposed to have been executed before the Alcalde as the
source or foundation of his title.
1. Whenever he refrred to the source of his title he umformly pointed to the writing of partnership. Sale of five barras
or shares of the mine was on the 17th day of December, 1846
made by the claimant to Alexander Forbes, of Tepic.
2. Negotiations for the purchase and sale commenced on the
5th of the same month between the claimant a-d Francisco M.
Negrete, the agent of the purchaser. Several interviews took
place, but the negotiations were suspended to await the arrival
of the Padre Ugenio McNamara, the Agent of Jos6 Castro. He
arrived from Tepic a short time before the contract of sale was

DECEMBER TEIM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andre-4 Casillero.
7ompleted, and Negrete testifies that up to that time he had seen
no other-document than the writing-of partnership, and no other
bad been mentioned- Padre McNamara brought with him the
contract of lease or avio, which had been concluded between
him, as the agent of Jos6 Castro, and Alexander Forbes.
3. Claimant approved the contract of avio, voluntarily putting
into it his claim to the two square leagues of land. At the same
time, also, he executed the conveyance of the five shares to the
purchaser, but in none of these transactions was any mention
made of the registry of the mine or of the act of juridical pea.
session, leaving it to be inferred that the writing of partnership
was the only document ever executed before the Alcalde, or
certainly that there was no other, that the claimant thought
proper to exhibit to a purchaser.
IX. Much stronger evidence, however, is exhibited in the
record to show that the parties most interested in the mine, and
who were engaged in working it, knew full well that the supposed title was invalid, as is fully shown by the correspondence
between James A. Forbes and Alexander Forbes, or between
the" former and Barron Forbes & Company. More than forty
letters between these parties are exhibited in the record.
Brief references will be made to such as have the most direct
bearing upon the quescion under consideration, omitting all such
parts as are not material to the inquiry, but preserving the sub.
stance. 1. Under date of the 5th May, 1847, James A. Forbes
suggests to William Forbes, but evidently in reply to letters
received from Alexander Forbes, that it is of the most vital importance to obtain from Mexico a positive, formal and unconditional grant of the two sitios of land conceded to thh claimant
according to the decree appended to the contract, and also an
unqualified ratification of 'the jui. lical possession which. was
given of the mine by the local authorities, including, if po~sible,
the three thousand varas of land given in that possession as a
gratification to the discoverer. He also suggests in the name
letter that the documents should be made out in the name of the
claimant and his partners.

munication. Record shows that Alexander Forbes visited
California early in October, 1847, and it appears that he remained there until near the close.of March, 1848, engaged, at
least for a part of the time, in exploring the mine and in overseeing the prudential affairs of the Company. During that
I eriod other persons acquired an interest in the mine, and
among the number were Barron, Forbes & Company, and they
accordingly wrote to James A. Forbes, under date of the 11th
of April, 1849, informing him that hereafter he might expect
that the mine would be worked to the utmost of its capabilities
of production. On the 20th of May, 1849, they wrote another
letter to the same individual, saying in effect that from certain
circumstances that he had mentioned it might be necessary to
purchase some lands in the vicinity of1 fh6nfine and hacienda
of New Almaden, and authorized hii to make sudh purchases,
not to exceed in price the sum of $5000, as might 15 necessary

such other arrangements as he rhight deem nec~ssa y for that
purpose.
S. Seven days after thi date of 1ht letter, andt-before it was
received, James A. Forbes arrived at Tbpi'~3; i'dil while there left
with Alexander Forbes the follldwing memorandum to be
delivered to the claimatit: "Very private." Memorandum of the
documents which ' Don Anidres {EAstillero will have to procure
in Mexico.
"1st. The full approbation and ratification by the Supreme
,Government of all the acts of the Alcalde of the District of San
Jose, in Upper California-in the possession given by the said
officers of the quicksilver mine situated in his jurisdiction, to

"2d. An absolute and unconditional title of two leagues of
land to Don Andres Castillero, specifying the following boiidaaries :-On the north by the lands of the Rancho of- San Vicente

besides, certified to by the American Minister in Mexico,-and
transmitted to California as soon as possible.
"Tepic, May 27, 1849."
Proofs in the case show that the author of that memorandum
returned to San Francisco, and on the 28th day of October
following, in a letter to William Forbes, he again called his
attention to the importance of his former suggestions as to the
necessity of perfecting the title to the mine. In that letter he
also referred to verbal explanations-previously given by him to
his correspondent and Alexander Forbes, lnd then proceeds to
impress upon the mina of his correspondent the vast importance
of securing from Mexico the documents comprised in the memorandum left with Alexander FGrbes, when he was in Tepic, for
the claimant. Two days afterwards he wrote again to Alexander Forbes, in which letter, among other things, he says to his
correspondent, you will now readily perceive the great importance of my advice to you to purchase a part both of the lands
of Cook and of the Berreyesas. You were of the opinion that
this measure would not be necessary in view of the supposed
facility of getting the title to the mine perfected in Mexico, and
he complains that more than five months have elapsed since it
was decided that the claimant should procure the necessary
documents in that city, and that they have not been sent to him
4. His description of his situation shows plainly that he was
in great.want of the documents, because he says that on the one
side he depended upon the precarious and illegal possession of
the mine granted by the Alcalde of the District to the claimant,
who was himself in reality the judge of the quantity of land
given by the Alcalde; and on the other side, he says he was
attacked by the purchasers of-the same land. declared by the
claimant himself to comprise the mine. Evidently that letter I
was regarded as one of importance, for it called forth two replies,
one from Barron, Forbes & Co., and one from Alexander Forbes.
By the one first mentioned, he was informed bj his-correspondent
that on the 13th of the same month they had enclosed to him a
notarial copy of the grant of land made by the Mexican Govern
ment to the claimant.

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
They acknowledged therein the receipt of his letters, thanked
him for his able conduct, expressed satisfaction in view of the
document sent, that he had not been obliged to purchase the
laud of Berreyesa, but submitted the matter to his best judg.
ment, requesting him, however, to keep in view, "that at all
hazard, and at whatever cost, the property of the mine must be
secured," adding, "Castillero, we expect, will soon be here from
Lower California, and if anything can be done in Mexico, he is
the fittest person to procure what may be wanted." Recurring
to the other letter, it will be seen that it was more guarded, but
the writer recommends that his correspondent and agent should
proceed, without fear of disapproval, or waiting for instructions,
in taking such measures as shall preserve this valuable "negotiacion" from any risk from those unprincipled claimants who
have lately given him so much trouble, or from any other proceedings that may take place.
5. Another letter, also, was written by Alexander Forbes to
James A. Forbes, under date of the 1st of December, 1849, in
which he stated that the copy of the grant of land made to the
claimant was, by mistake, not the one meant to be sent; and he
explains the difference, which was, that the one sent was directed
at the foot to the Governor, but the proper one was directed to
the claimant, and was deposited at Monterey. Explanation is
also given as to the difference in the legal effect between the two
documents, which was, as explained, that by the first one the
delivery by the Governor was perhaps necessary, wheieas the
other, being addressed directly to the claimant, did not require
that formality, nor was any other proceeding necessary, thus
making it,. as the writer affirmed, a better document than the
greater part of the other titles for lands in that Department.
Having made these explanations, he then expressed the hope
that the well known elevernfess of his correspondent had already
enabled him to. find out the mistake; suggesting, but rather
doubtingly, that the one previously sent should be withdrawn.
and the second one substituted in its place; but presently, as if
upon reflection, mentions another difficulty which might arise.
and that was th- the copy of the grant of the two sitios of land

inserted in the contract of lease or avio was also directed to .the
Governor, and in view of that fact he"finally decided to send a
copy of all the documents and leave it to the good judgm.nt of
his correspondent to make such use of them as he should think
proper. Nothing need be remarked respecting the copy of the
document last sent, except to say that if it was addressed to the
claimant it was a forgery, as the whole evidence shows that but
one dispatch upon the subject was ever issued by the Minister
of Relations, and that was directed to the Governor.
6. Reference will next be made to another letter from Alexauder Forbes under date of the 3d of February, 1850, which is
also addressed to the same person as the preceding letter.
Among other things the writer states that he has every'reason
to believe that the documents mentioned by his correspondent
would be found in the City of Mexico, and as the clainant would
return that way he had no doubt they would be procured. In
another part of the same letter he also states that at present they
think it may be the best plan "to get an authenticated copy of
the approval of the Mexican Government of the grant of three
thousand varas given by the Alcalde on giving possession of the
mine," "as a doubt may be started whether the Alcalde, acting
as the 'Jues de mine?*,' had a right to make this grant, yet if
approved by the Government of Mexico, before the possession of
the country by the Americans, there could be no doubt on the
*
*

subject."

Castillero says such approval was given, and that on his arrival
in Mexico he will procure a judicial copy of it. This is theplan
we shall adopt if we hear nothing from you to alter this resolution. Writing from the mine, James A. Forbes, on the 26th day of
February, 1850, replied to that letter, and the importance of that
reply makes it necessary to give a somewhat extended extract
from it as disclosing the inttut and purpose of the entire series.
Speaking of the claimant, he says:
"He succeeded in obtaining the grant of two sitios to himself
on the mining possession in Santa Clara,while that very act of
possession declares that the mine is situated on the lands of one
Jos6 R. Berreyesa, five leagues distant from Sata Clara, and

you will at once perceive that such a discrepancy woul not
fail to attract the attention of United States Land Commissi( ners
and to put the case of the mine in great risk in the judicial o: deal
to which its title will be subjected.
"Without troubling you with what I have so many times
written and explained to you verbally, on the importance of the
acquisition of the document, I will only say now what it must be.
and it is this:
'l. A full and complete ratification of all the acts of the
Alcalde of this jurisdiction in the possession of the mine.
"2. A full and unconditional grant to Castillero of two sitios
of land covering that mining possession, expressing the boundaries stated by me in the memorandum I left with you at Tepic.
Both of these documents to be of the proper date, and placed in
the proper governmenital custody in Mexico; and"3. The necdssary'certified copies of them duly authenticated
by the American Minister in that capital, taken and sent to me
at the earliest possible moment."
Prompt reply was made by Barron, Forbes & Co., to that com
munication, under date of the 2d of March, 1850, in which they
say: "Mr. Barron and Don Andres Castillero, are about to pro.
ceed to the City of Mexico and will attend to what you have
recommended. When that letter was written, the persons therein
named were about to proceed to Mexico, but Alexander Forbes,
nine days later, wrote a letter to the same correspondent, in
which he stated that Mr. Barron and Castillero have gone off tu
Mexico, and I wrote them to-day respecting the document you know
of, which, if possible, will be procured." Wishing, doubtless, to
keep his correspondent well advised of the efforts being made to
comply with his requisition for the title papers to the mine, he
wrote him again on the 7th of April, 1850, in which he stated
"that Mr. Barron and Castillero have arrived in Mexico, and
ha reever*v prospect of finding the documents you are aware of
and which will, of course, be forwarded as soon as possible."
Counsel for claimant admit that every one of these letters are
genuine, and the proofs in the case are full to that effect. Coin
lents upon these extraordigary documents are unnecessarv a-

they disolose their own construction and-afford a demonstration
that those in the possession of the mine, holding it under conveyances for the claimant, knew full well that he had no title.
X. More than that can hardly be required in this case, bft it
is equally true, and satisfactory proofs are exhibited'in the
record to show it, that Mexico herself knew, must have knownu,
that the pretensions of the claimant were unfounded, else she
never could have agreed to the 10th article of the treaty, or,
when that was stricken out, never could have given her sanction to the corresponding explanations that were signed by the.
duly authorized representatives of both countries. Remarksd
ho*ever, upon that topic are unnecessary, and we forbear to pursue the subject.

with directions to dismiss the entire petition.
Mr. Justice CATRON, dissenting: I am of the opinion that
Castillero acquired an incipient right by the discovery of tI e
mine, and the surface of the land lying above the mine to tI e
extent that it was adjudged to him by the District Court.
I also think Castillero made registry of his discovery befo7,
the proper tribunal according to the Mexican laws as they e:
isted in the Territory of California at the time the registry wi
made and notified to the public. That the Alcalde had jurisdic.
tion as a judicial magistrate in the absence and non-existence of
any other authority in California to make the registry and give
possession; and that this state of the law was virtually recognized by the Mining Junta at the city of Mexico, when Castiltero applied to that tribunal for assistance in money, lands, and
retorts, to assist him in working the mine. The request was
promptly granted by the Junta, with two leagues of land to
furnish fuel for evaporating the quicksilver; and this proposed
grant, the President of Mexico sanctioned, referring the application for the grant of land to the Governor of the Territory, but
which was never presented, and could not be, owing to the
American war.

These officers of the Supreme Government were fully aware
.hat no Mining Boards existed in California, nor any Courts of
the First Instance; and that therefore the Court of the Alcalde
was the tlbunal exercising the powers of a Court of the First
Instance. Such is the settled construction of the Alcalde's power

Mexico was, that in the absence of Mining Deputies, the ordi.

the discoverer's application and in giving him judicial possession
of the mine. So various witnesses prove, and among them Mr.
Larkin, our consul at Monterey, at the time of this discovery.
I think it true, beyond any reasonable ground for doubt, that
in other parts of Mexico, Alcaldes did act on applications such
as that of Castillero, where gold or silver was discovered, and
that many mining titles are held by virtue of registries and acts
of possession transacted before Alcaldes, and recorded in the
form of espedientes in their Courts, just as the evidence of
Castillero's was found in Alcalde Pico's office. Nor have I any
doubt, whatever, that if the Mexican Government had continued
in California, that the title to this mine would have been con.
firmed to Castillero, not 6nly promptly, but without dispute,
concerning small and immaterial irregularities. That Government, in my judgment, would have recognized the discoverer's
equity, founded on the right of discovery. This discovery is
free from doubt, nor is the fact of discovery disputed. So the
Mexican officers from the President down, treated it when presented to them, and so the judges of the District Court held,
when they confirmed the claim. Their judgment, and the reasons
for it, we-are called on to review; and it is due to them to say,
that, in a long judicial life, I have never had presented to me, a
case so laboriously and thoroughly investigated in the lower
Courts. With them this case has been the study for years.
The claim, perhaps, covers the most valuable mine in the world,
and its title has been litigated at an expense and with a degree
of labor and ability, rarely equalled, and never excelled within
uy ex)erience.
I ha ie examined the opinions of the judges who decided the

cause in the District Court and the briefs of counsel, and have
verified the arguments by the record on all maierial questions, so
far as I thought them material, and my opinion is, that the law
and the facts discussed by the District Court, and on which its
judgment is founded, furnish reasons that cannot be answered,
showing that the claim is valid. And I adopt the opinion and
reasons preceding the judgment below as my opinion in the case
here.
Judge Hoffman's individual opinion displays an astuteness and
a knowledge of the facts, and of the mining laws applying to the
controversy, hardly to be excelled, and with which I fully con-.
cur, with the exception, that I think he was in error in maintaining that the President of Mexico granted the two leagues of land
covering the mine. The President referred the request of Castillerofor the land to the Governor of California, to be proceeded
on by him, according to the Act of 1824, and Regulations of
1828. This was not done by the Governor, because the United
States troops'expelled him and broke up the Mexican authorities exercising the granting power, before he had time to act.
It was obviously a matter of great anxiety with the SupremeGovernment, that this quicksilver mine should be worked immediately, and as extensively as possible, because Europe had to be
relied'on for a supply of quicksilver, without which the gold and
silver mines of Mexico were comparatively worthless. This discovery of Castillero was, therefore, esteemed by the Mining
Junta and the higher officers as of the greatest importance. So
deemed, that our Government was officially
important was itnotified by our Consul, Mr. Larkin, (acting nbarest to the mine,)
that the discovery had been made. The mine drew to its develop.
ment a great amount of capital. Nearly a million of dollars has
been expended in opening and bringing forth its resources
The public have been benefitted many millions by the quicksilver furiiished to those working the gold mines discovered in
California, and on bth sides of the Rocky Mountains. The
public benefit, past and prospective, can hardly be over-estimated. So far from being the subject of reproach and severe
critic'sm, the wealthy proprietors who have worked this mine

with success, are entitled to our -approbation, as they have
undoubtedly been public benefactors. Truly, their object was
gain; but they have done that which poverty could not accomplish, and they have done that which the United States, as the
successful litigant, will, in all human probability, fail to do; that
of being successful miners.
Much stress has been laid on the fact, that James Alexandei
Forbes proposed to his associates to forge a title to this mining
property: Forbes, apprehending that Castillero's claim was not
valid, because the proceeding to acquire a legal interest w.s
irregular. But no step was taken to fabricate an apparent title
nothing was done towards its accomplishment. The proposition
died in its conception, and as a controlling circumstance in the
case the fact is worthless.
1. That Castillero discovered the mine, is true beyond controversy.
2. That he registered the fact of discovery in the Alcalde's
office, and that it was made notorious, is, I think, true. It w~s
officially communicated to the Mexican Congress by Secretary
of Interior Relations; that it was prominently notorious in California; was officially communicated to our Government, and was
published in the newspapers of t,e Sandwich Islands.
8.Nor is it open to any dispute, as it seems to me, that Castillero's right, as a discoverer, was recognized by the Supreme
Government of Mexico, as a valid and highly meritorious claim.
4. The mine was never denounced by any one for irregularity
in the proceeding to perfect the title to it, nor for abandoning
the possession.
In this condition the claim stood when we acquired the
country; and we are bound by the treaty to protect all just
private interests in lands in the territory acquired by it. I, there
fore, think the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed

of this Court just announced in this
I think that the claim and title of the petitioner, Andres Castil~ero, to the mine known by the name of New Almaden, in
Santa Clara County, Northern District of the State of California,
is a good and valid claim and title, and that the said Andres
Castillero and his assigns are the owners thereof, and of all the
ores and minerals of whatsoever description therein in fee simple.
In my judgment, also, I concur with the learned Judges of the
District Court, &c., &c., that the said mine is a piece of land
embracing a superficial area, to be measured on a horizontal
plane, equivalent to seven pertenencias, each pertenencia being
a solid, of a rectangular base, two hundred Castilian varas long,
of the width established by the Ordinanza de Mineria of 1783,
and in depth extending from and including the surface down to
the centre of the earth; said pertenencias to be located in such
manner as the said Andres Castillero or his' assigns may select,
subject to the following conditions: First, that the said perte.
nencias shall be contiguous, that is to say, in one body;. and
secondly, that within them shall be included the original mouth
of the mine, known as New Almaden.
Having thus fully expressed my concurrence in the decree
rendered by the District Court in favor of Andres Castillero and
his assigns, and my dissent from its reversal by this Court, I Mll
add that, in my opinion, it is fully shown by the testimony and
documents in the record that in no thing done by Castillero or
"hi- assigns, in connection with the mining claim, is there any
proof of fraud; and I believe, from the testimony and from
those documents, that the petitioner and his assigns have rights
under the 8th Article of the Treaty with Mexico, of which they
cannot be deprived by any judgment rendered by this Court or
its proceedings upon the record brought into this Court by
appeal.
I adopt and herewith annex to this dissent the opinion of his
Honor, Ogden Hoffman, District Judge, (as embodied in the
-ecord,) as th- best way of showing my appreciation of 'the law

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

and merits of this case, and of his judicial learning and Y-search
in connection with it:
The claimant in this case asks. the confirmation of his title
toFirst. A mine of quicksilver situated in Santa Clara County,
and called the mine of "New Almaden," including three thou.
sand varas of ground measured in all directions from the mouth
of the mine.
Second. Two square leagues of land situated upon the land of
the above mentioned mining possession.
It is objected that this Court has no jurisdiction to decree a
confirmation of the former claim. The objections relied on by
the United States are two:
1. That by the Act of 3d March, 1851, the jurisdiction of th;s
Court is confined to cases where the interest claimed is a fee
simple interest, or such as in equity should be converted inio
one, and that such interest was not held by the owner or grantc-e
of a mine by Mexican law.
2. That the subject-matter of this claim is not "land," within
the meaning of the Act.
The first objection is not only wholly unsupported by the
words of the Act, but it is inconsistent with the sense of justice
and the sacredness of treaty stipulations which we must presume
to have actuated Congress.
•1. The Act declares that every person claiming lands by
virtue of any right or title derived from the Spanish or Mexican
Governments shall present his claim, etc.
Q
There is thus no specification as to the nature of the claim,
except that it must be to "land," nor of the estate or interest
claimed. It may be leasehold or freehold, conditional or indefeasible, for years or in fee.
2. That such estates constitute property, in its ful~eg sense,
will not be denied.
If, then, claims to such estates in lands cannot be preseLited for
confirmation under the-Act of 1851, or if presented are to be
rejected, this, species of property in land is not merely unprotected, but by the terms of the Act it is confiscated; for the 13th

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

215

The United States vs. Andi'es -astilo.
Section provides that all lands, the claims fo which have been
finally rejected, or which shall not haVe been 'presented within
two years, shall be deemed, held and considered as part of the
public domain of the United States.
It cannot, therefore, be imputed to Congress that it meant to
declare all lands public property the claims to which were not
presented, and at the same- time.restrict the right of presenting
claims tc a limited number of cases, thus ignoring and confis:
cating, all rights of property in land but those of a particular
description, when all were equally sacred under the laws of
nations and the stipulations of the Treaty.
8. But even if the jurisdiction of this Court were limited, as
supposed, the estate of the owner of a mine under the Mexican
and Spanish Ordinances was of at least as high a decree as a
determinable fee at common law, and the concession of a mine
conveyed to him full property in the very substance of the mine.
As, however, the nature of the mine-owner's estate in a mine
cannot be considered without examining and ascertaining what
was the nature of a mine itself, and whether it constituted "land,"
as that term is used in the common law, and in the Act of Congres, the point will be treated of in considering the second
objection to the jurisdiction of the Court.
2. Is a mine laznd within the meaning of the Act of Congfess?
"By the civil law," says Gamboa, "all veins and mineral
deposits of gold and silver ore, or of precious stones, belonged,
ifin public ground, to the Sovereign, and were part of his patri-.
mony, but if on private ground, to the owner of the land, subject
to the condition, that if worked by the owner he was bound to
render a tenth part of the produce to the Prince as a right
attaching to his Crown. It subsequently became an established
custom in most kingdoms., that all veins of the precious metals,
and the produce of such veins, should vest in the Crown and be
held to be a part of the patrimony of the King or Sovereign
Prin3e. That this is the case with respect to the Empire of
Germany, the Electorates, France, Portugal, Arragon, and Cata
lonia, appears from the laws of those countries, and from, the
authority of various authors.' 1 Heath. Gamboa, 15.

SUPREME COURrI.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
The reasons fir attfibuting to the Sovereign this right of property in a part of the soil of the land of his subjects, it is not
necessary to recapitulate; but that the distinction between the
ownership of the surface, and that- of the mines or minerals
beneath it, was recognized at a Very early period, appears from
the law of the Partida, which declares that the property of the
mines shall not pass in a grant of the land by the King, although
not excepted out of the grant-and even if included in it, the
grant shall be valid as to mines only during the life of the King
who made it; and a similar rule prevailed in England with
respect to mines of the royal metals, which alone were held to
belong to the Sovereign by prerogative.
The distinction thus drawn between the right of property in
the surface, and that in the minerals beneath, is founded on the
essential difference in the qualities of the various substances of
which the earth is composed. It has accordingly been recognized in the jurisprudence of all nations.
In Spain, as we have seen, mines do not pass in grants of land
(fundos) by the Sovereign, unless particularly mentioned. (1
Heathf. Gamb. i32.) To the same effect is Solorzano, (Pol. Ind.
lib. 6, ch. 1 No. 17,) who says: So that, although private persons
may allege and prove that they possess such lands (tierras) and
their appurtenances by special gift and concession of the Prince,
no matter how general may be the words in which the grant is
made, this will not of itself be of any avail or advantage to them
for acquiring or gaining thereby the mines which may be discovered in the lands, unless it is so specially provided and
expressed in said grant ;" and Colmeira, (Der. Adm. Esp.)
observes: "Jurisconsults and Publicists agree in the opinion
that it is proper to distinguish in the soil (en el suelo) the right
of property in the superficies (de la superficie) from that in the
depth (del ondo.) Truly, the' man who acquires a piece of land,
gives not the least labor nor advances 'the smallest capital in
consideration of the riches (las riquezas) which it may conceal.
He examines its fertilty, its situation, its extent, and all the
circumstances which determine its value as a building-lot or
agri 3ultural land, but he does not take into account the mineo

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castiflero.
which, perchance, it may conceal in its bowels. There is not,
then, the least relation between the proprietor (of the land) and
the subterranean matter from which any right can be deduced."
So, ]~ares, a Mexican author, in his Derecho Administrativo,
p. 93, remarks: "The law then, has not recognized property ii,
the mine to be in the owner of the soil, but has made the pro
perty in the mine to consist in the grant which the Nation'
makes to him who registers or denounces it conformably to the
6rdinauce."
By the French law'of 1810, the same distinction is recognized,
and all mines of gold, silver, platinum, lead, mercury, etc., are
declared not to belong to the owner of the soil, but to be
governed by the Mining Laws (Teulet's Sup. to Codes, Verb.
Mines.) "From the moment," (says the author last cited, "when
a mine shall be conceded even to the proprietor of the surface,
this pyroperty shall be distinguished from that of the surface; and
thenceforth .considered a new property," and, Le Guay, in his
Thesis on Mining Legislation, says he "agrees with Mirabeau in
the propo.dtion that any legislation which does not recognize
two species. of property, one in the surface of the earth, and the
other in its depth, would be-absurd." -P. 125.
In his work on the General Jurisprudence of Mines, M
Blavier obseives: "It is a truth which has been admitted for a
long time, that the preservation and prosperity of mines depend
essentially on the adoption of a system of laws calculated to
reconcile the interests of the public with that of those who work
them. * * * It is these conditions whi6h the governments
of ancient and modern States have sought to fulfill in admitting,
nearly all of them, that the Sovereign alone has 'the right to
dispose of the public property in mines, or to confer on others
the useful enjoyment thereof. '
This regalian right, or right reserved by the whole State to
dispose of subterranean property as public property, independent of the private ownership of the land which conceals it,
seems to have been recognized in Germany .from the earliest
periods; (Caacrin. Dr. Pub. des Mines en Allemagne, p. 2;) and
M Bh.vier i marks: "It is, therefore, not surprising that this

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
regalian right should have been confirmed by nearly all the
governments of the northern countries."
But it is unnecessary to multiply authorities in support of a
principle so universally recognized.
From the foregoing citations it is clear1. That the grant or ownership of the superficies or land
which contains the mine, confers no right of property to mines
in the bowels of the earth, or even on its surface; and
2. That this property in the mines is, by common consent of
almost all modern States, deemed to b6 vested in the State
represented by the Sovereign, and is a regalian right. Indeed,
it would seem, thaf these two propositions are sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that mining ordinandes exist in almost
every State possessed of considerable mineral wealth; for those
ordinances are but the dispositions made by law for the exercise
of this regalian right, or right of property in all mines, whether
in public or private land.
Having thus established that the right of property in mines is
wholly distinct from the ownership of the soil, and that the
former remainb in the Sovereign, notwithstanding the possession
of the latter by a private person, we proceed to inquire:
1. Did this right to the mine constitute a right to "land," as
that term is used in the Acts of Congress?
2. If so, did the miner by registry and denouncement acquire
an estate in "land," and what was its quantity and quality?
These two inquiries, though in form separate, are nevertheless
intimately connected; for the nature of the subject-matter of the
right of property reserved by the Sovereign, can best be ascertained by inquiring what was the subject-matter of the estate
conveyed to the subject by registry and denouncement, as also
the quality and quantity of such estate. "For how," as remarked by Lares, "can the nation grant that which it has not,
or how can it give to one person what belongs to another ?"
It will be shown that minerals owned by a title wholly independent of the property in the lands in which they are situated,
still form a part of the land itself, and constitute land in the
6trictlvilegal accentation of that term at ,ommon law. Inde.

pendently of authority, itwould seem clear that, it being admitted
that "various sections of the soil divided horizontally," (1 Eng.
Law and Eq. Rep. 249,) may belong as separate. properties to
different persons, the sections which are beneath the surface must
constitute "land," as much as those which are upon it. The vein
of ore or the bed of coal is "land," as fully and completely as the
superficial earth, and he who owns the former owns land as much
as he who owns the latter. On this point the English authorities are agreed.
Nor is the application of those authorities to the question
under consideration at all affected by the circumstanqe that, i'a
England, the regalian right to mines is held to extend only to
mines of the precious metals; for the owner of lands in which
mines of the base metals are situated, having alienated to one
person the mine, but reserved to himself or alienated to another
the lands in which the mine is found, the question whether the
owner of the mine" is an owner of "land," would be presented
precisely as if the severance of the two rights of property had
originally existed, and the several properties'derived by separate
grants from the Crown.
"When the mines form part of the general inheritance, they
will, of course, be transferred along with the lands without being
expressly mentioned in the conveyance; but when they form a
distinct p'ossession or inheritance, a title to them must be established, without reference to the general title df the lands in which
they are situated." Bainbridge on Mines, p. 4; Rockwell, p. 586.
In the latter situation, "they still, of course, retain the qualities of real estate, and will be transferred by conveyances applicaple {o the particular disposition of them intended to be made."

When a reservation in a deed of feoffment is made in favor
of the grantor of mines, no livery is necessary, for. the grantor
will never have been out of possession; but when the exception
is in favor of a stranger to the legal estate, livery cannot be dispensed with. Co. Litt., 47 a; 1 Ad. & Ell., p. 748.
In numerous English cases, the distinction is clearly drawn
between a mere license to dig and carry away ores, in land of
which the possession is retained by the grantor, and a demise of
the mine itself, by which an estate in the land is created; nor is
it 1r..assary, to constitute such an estate, that the grantee acquire
any right or interest in the surface-for minerals are capable of
forming a distinct inheritance in the lands of which they are a
part, and consequently, an actual estate may be both created in;
and restricted to, any specified kind of minerals. 19 Vesey, p.
158; 4 East, p. 469; 2 Barn. & Ald., p. 724; Bainbridge on
Mines, pp. 3, 55, 124, 141; 170.
In Stoughton vs. Leigh, (1 Taunt., p 403,) it was held, that a
grant of a stratum of coal in the land of another is a grant in
fee simple of a real hereditament, and that the widow of the
grantee was dowable of all the mines of her husband, as well
those which were in his own landed estates, as the mines and
strata of lead, or lead ore and coal, in the lands of other persons.
In Wilkinson vs. Proud et als., (11 Mees. & Wels., p. 33,) it
was held, that a right to a given substratum of coal lying under
a certain close is a right to land, and cannot be claimed by prescription. But a bare right to dig and carry away coal in another
man's land may.
An action of ejectment, an assize, a common recovery trespass, an action for use and occupation, and almost all the legal
remedies applicable to "land," can be maintained at common
law with respect to a mine. But they do not lie for an incorporeal thing. Ad. on Eject, p. 18-20; Co. Litt., 6 a.; Bain

den, p. 310,) is relied on by the counsel of the United States to
show that in England the right of the King to royal metals in
the lands of a subject is a merely incorporeal right or easement,
like rights of common, way, estovers, and the like.
But it is not so said in the case. It is merely said, that as the
subject may acquire by usage, title or interest in the freehold
or inheritance of the King, as common, way, estovers, etc.. so the
King may possess by prerogative a title or interest m the free.
hold of the subject. It is not said that the title or interest of the
King in royal mines is identical with the title or interest of the
subject, who has a right of common, way, estovers, etc., in tho
King's lands.
If the private owner of the inheritance can, by his grant
sever the right of property in the soil from that in the mine, and
vest the ownership of the former in one person, and of the latter
in another; and if the mine so owned is "land," it is not easy to
perceive why, when the severance is effected by law, and the
King is the owner of the mine, he should.not also be deemed
the owner of "land ;" and this, whether the royal right is con.
fined, as in England, to a particular description of mines, or
extends, as in Spain, to all mines.
That this was not meant to be decided in the case.in PlowdeA
is clear; for no question was made as to whether the right of
the King was a corporeal or incorporeal hereditament, and the
judgment of the Court was, "that all ores of gold and silver in
the lands of subjects, whether the mines thereof be opened oi
unopened, with power to dig in the lands of the subjects for tho
same, and to carry them away, with all other incidents thereto,
belong of right to the Queen."

From the forgoing authorities, it is abundantly clear, that the
law of England is not guilty of what Mirabeau calls the absurdity
of refusing to recognize two species of property, one in the surface of the earth, and the other in its depth.
That in the case of royal mines, the property in the mines
remaina in the Crown, distinct from the general ownership of the
land in which they are situate, and in the case of base mines, the
general owner may sever by his own grant the property'in the'

SUPREME

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
mines from the property in the lands. But in both cases, the mine
or strata of minerals form part of the land itself, and are land in as
strictly legal a sense as the non-metalliferous portions of the soil.
Having thus seen that a property in veins of metals is a property in "land," notwithstanding it is entirely independent of the
property in the §oil which contains them, and that it is so regarded, whether the severance between the two species of
property be effected by the grant of the Sovereign to whom
royal metals belong, ar by the owner of the inheritance, who, by
the law of England, was the owner of the base metals within his
lands, we will next inquire what was the nature of the estate
which was acquirea by registry and denouncement under the
Spanish and Mexican laws.
This inquiry will necessarily involve a consideration of the
nature of a mine under those laws; for it is admitted, as urged
by the counsel of the United States, that an estate in a mine may
closely resemble anc estate in land, while the subject-matter of
the two estates may remain essentially different.
It will, therefore, be shown not only that the estate of a minoowner is nearly identical with a fee simple conditional estatc in
land, at the common law, but that the subject-matter of that
estate, viz., "a mine," as defined in the Ordinances, is "land" in
the 'trictest sense, as proved by it intrinsic nature, and by the
application to it in Spanish and Mexican laws and treatises of
terms which describe and express what is understood in our
jurisprudence by the word "land."
In the earlier periods of the Spanish Monar:chy, it was established as a principle of Castilian law, that all mines found in
the Royal Seignory belonged to the Crown. All persons were
prohibited from working them except under royal license. Part.

On the 10th January, 1559, Philip H., by a law promulgated
on that day, extended to all mines.of gold, silver and quicksilver
found within the kingdom, whether on royal land or on those of
lordships, or of the clergy, or in public, municipal, vacant or
private lands, the right of ownership which had previously been
vested in th& Crown, as to mines found within the Royal Seignory; and all mines of the three metals. named were declared
"to be resumed and incorporated in the Crown and royal-patrimony of the King," excepting only such mines of gold or silver,
as had, under previous grants to irdividuals, been begun to be
worked, and were then actually worked Nov. Recop. lib. 9
tit. 18, 1. 3, Halleck's Mining Laws, pp. 6, 15; Rockwell. 113,
116.
The reasons for this act of high sovereignty are set forth in
the preamble of the law. They are chiefly founded on the policy
of stimulating the discovery and working of mines, by giving
to all subjects of the Crown the right of discovering and acquiring th ownership of them in limited parcels, in order that
thereby this source of national wealth might be developed,
instead of being locked up, as theretofore, in the hands of a few,
who did not or would not develop it. Rockwell's Gamb. Comm.,
p. 127; lTSov. Recop. lib. 9, tit. 18, : 3; Halleck's Transc. p. 6-11.
It thus became an established and fundamental principle of the
Spanish law, that all mines of gold, silver, quicksilver, and other
metals, whether found on public or private lands, belonged to
the Sovereign. Rockw. Gamb., 126, 107; Solorzano Polit. Ind,

treated of the incorporation into the royal patrimony of the gold,
silver, and quicksilver mines of the kingdom.
The 2d article of the New Ordinances is as follows:
"And in order to benefit and favor our subjects and natives,
and all other persons whatsoever, even though foreigners to these
our kingdoms, who may work or discover any mines of silver
already discovered, or to be discovered, we will and command
that they shall have them, and that they shall be their property
m possession and ownership, and that they may do with them as
with any thing their own, observing, as well in regard to-what
they have to pay by way of duty to us, as in all else, what is
prescribed and ordeied in this edict." Halleck's Transc., p. 70.
By the laws of the Indies, the Emperor Charles and King
Philip II. had made a similar grant to all their subjects, whether
Spaniards or Indians, (except certain officers,) authorizing them
to work the mines freely and without impediment, and "making
them common to all persons, wheresoever situate ;" provided,
that the Indians should not be injuriously treated, and that no
other parties be prejudiced. 1 Heathf. Gamboa, p. 20, book iv.
lib. xix., law 1; Recop. de las Indies; Halleck's Transe., pp
130, 140.
From the very ample terms of these grants a doubt arose, says
Gamboa, whether the mines were still to be regarded as the pecu.
liar right of the Crown, or whether they were to be considered
as the absolute property of the subject.
On the one side, Don Mateo de Lagunez and Cardinal de Luca
were of opinion, that as all mines in the Indies had been declared
"common," and all persons were at liberty to try for them,
wherever situate, it ws to be inferred that the mines were no
longer vested. in the Crown, and that the effect of the Ordinances
was precisely the same as if the mines had been made private
property, (particular,) as they may be by concession and
privilege.
This opinion Gamboa combats, and after discussing the question at length, concludes that the mines remained a right of the
Crown and annexed to the royal patrimony, and that the laws
made the vassals ".participants" of this right; not giving them

the private and absolute property to use at.will, but in subjection to the Ordinances; and that although the laws cdncede to
them the ownership and property (dominio y propiedad,) it is
by "participation," and not by absolute translation, (por participacion y no por translacion absoluta;) the supreme right of
property (alto domiio) remaining in His Majesty.
"The correct opinion then seems to be," says Gamboa, "that
the mines remain attached to the Crown (que S. M. mantiene en
su corona las minas,) and that the King, not being able to work
them himself, has admitted his subjects to a share of them (dio
parte i los vasalos) under various restrictions and subject to
various liabilities."
The opinion advocated by Gamboa appears to have been
adopted in the Ordinances of 1783, in which many of the suggestions of Gamboa were embodied. (Gamboa, chap. 11.)
The first two articles of title V. of that Ordinance are it
follows:
"Art. 1. Mines are the property of my Royal Crown, as well
by'their nature and origin, as by their re-union, declared in law
Iv., lib. xrn, book vi, of the Nueva Recopilacion.
"Art. 2. Without separating them from my royal patrimonr,
I grant them to my subjects in property (en..ropiedx) and poti.
session in such manner that they may sell them, exchange them,
rent them, donate them, pass them by will, eithLer in the way of
inheritance or legacy, or in any other manner alienate the rigt
which in the mines belongs to them, on the same terms on which
they themselves possess it, and to persons capable of acquiring
it" Valleck's Transc., p. 222.
It was under these last Ordinances that the rights of Castillero
were acquired; but as they adopted the views of Gamboa as to.
the Ordinances of 1584, his Commentaries on the Tatter, and
definition of the mine-owner's estate acquired *under them, are
of controlling authority in the interpretation of ihe Ordinances
ef 1783. " f

with the right of disposition and property (con el dominio y
propiedad) of the subjects, it is indisputable, that as a conse.
quence of their passing to the latter with power to dispose of
them, as their own (como cosa suya) all the incidents of "pro
perty" (propiedad y dominio) must attach in favor of the proprietor, and that they may therefore be exchanged, sold, leased
or alienated by contract, donation and inheritance, may be given
as a portion in marriage, or may be charged with a rent, and
that interest may be demanded for the purchase-money while
remaining unpaid, etc., etc.
"There passes, then, to the subject the direct dominion or pro
perty, as also the right to the use (dominio directo 6 propiedad,
y tambien el util,) by virtue of the favor and grant of the Sovereign-which we hestitate not to call a gift on conditions (una
modal donacion,) as will appear upon considering the rules by
which that species of grant is defined in law: that is to say, that
it be a free and complete act, which being perfected, a charge
attaches on the donee from that time forth, (and the being
worded as a cofidition makes no difference,) and that upon the
failure of the modification limited by the donor in his own favor
or in that of a third person, or of the Kingdom or Republic, the
gift determines, as will be seen by reference to the various text
and doctors." Ch. 11, see. 25.
Throughout the Commentaries of Gamboa, the estate of the
mine-owner in the mine is called the "dominio y propiedad;"
and in sec. 15, ch. xxI, he says: "Another privilege treated of
by the authorities above alluded to, is that of appropriating
nine parts of the metal, paying only the tenth to the King as an
acknowledgement of his having shared with his subjects the
direct and superficial ownership (de aver participado i sus
vasallos el dominio util y directo,) of so valuable a kind of pro.
perty (de tan preciososfundos).
We have already seen that the "alto dominio" of eminent
domain is reserved by the King, by virtue of which and of the
conditions on which the grant is made, a new grant may be
made if the first be forfeited by breach of the conditions, viz..
the payment of the fifth, and the observance of the Ordinaneea

wnich Gamboa calls the modo, or gravamen with which the
donation is charged, and which make it a "donacion modal."Chap. 11, art. 26.
From the foregoing citations the nature of the estate in the
mine acquired by registry and denouncement under the Spanish
laws, might seem sufficiently clear.
It will, however, not be inappropriate to show what in Spanish
law is the meaning of various terms which are used in the
Ordinances, and by Gamboa, as descriptive of his estate. Those
terms are "propiedad," "propiedad y posesion," "propiedad y usufructo," "propiedad y utilidad," "plena propiedad," "dominio,"
"pleno dominio," "dominic absoluto y perpetuo," "dominio
directo y util.'
"Propiedad,' ) is the right to enjoy and dispose freely of things
which are ours, so far as the laws forbid not. Commonly, the
dominion which is not accompanied by the usufruct is called
"propiedad," or "nuda propiedad," and the dominion which is
accompanied by the usufruct is called "plena propiedad." Es
cridhes Dict., verb. "Propiedad."
"Dominio," is the right or power to dispose freely of a thing,
if the law, the will of the testator, or some agreement does not
prevent.
It- is divided into the full, and the less than full-" dominio
pleno y menos pleno."
"Dominio pleno y absoluto," is the power which one has over
anything to alienate independently of another-to receive its
fruits-to exclude all others from its use.
"Dominio directo," is the right a person has to control the
disposition of a thing, the use (utilidad) of which he has ceded.
.Dominio util," is the right to receive all the fruits of a thing
subject to some contribution or tribute, which is paid to 1dm
who reserves in it the- "dominium directum."--Escriche's Dict.
verb. ' Dominio ;" Alvares' Institutes, vol. ii., pp. 23, 33.
It appears, therefore, that the words which the laws and commentators apply to the miner's estate, viz.: "propiedad y usufracto" "plena propiedad,.' "pleno dominio," "dominio directo
y util " etc., are descriptive in the Spanish law of the highest

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
estate or right of property in land which the subject caacquire.
It would seem to be higher than any right of property in land
enjoyed in England; for, says Blackstone, "A subject has only
usufruct and pot the absolute property of the soil ;" or, as Six
Edward Coke expresses, "he hath the 'dominium utile,' but not
the 'dominium directum.:" Comm. bk. 2, ch. 7.
The ownership of the subject in the mine remains, however
subordinate to the dominium altum, or eiiinens, or dominio alto
of the Crown.
But this is merely the right tacitly reserved by the Government or sovereign authority of t State, and to which all individual rights of property are subject, to take possession of the
property in the manner directed by the constitution and laws of
the State, whenever the public interest may require. Per Ch.
Walworth; Beekman vs. Saratoga R. R. Co., (3 Paige R., p. 45.)
The fact that the estate of the mine owner may be forfeited
or determined by a failure to comply with those of the ordinances which impose that penalty, i. e., by breach of the conditions subsequent attached to the gift, in nowise affects its nature
as an estate in fee.
Every estate held by feudal tenure was subject to forfeitur
for breach of the conditions on which it was granted. Nor were
these conditions always expressed in the grant; for every act of
the vassal which amounted to a breach of his allegiance, or the
tie which bound him to his lord, operated a forfeiture of the
land.
In a grant of a mine the principal conditions, the breach of
which worked a forfeiture, were: 1st, the payment to the Crown
of its proportion of the products; and 2d, the working it according to the laws.
If no breach of these conditions occurred, the estate of the
miner woVld continue forever.
It therefore closely resembled a conditional or determinable
fee at common law. 1 Prest. on Est., 480. The number of cases
-where, by the Ordinances of 1584, the mine was declared forfeited,
'perdida,) was no less than fifteen, but many of these causes of

forfeiture were totally abolished, and the rigor of the laws was
essentially mitigated by the Ordinances of 1783, and subsequent
laws.
The decree of the Cortes of Spain, of January 26, 1811, exempted the miners of quicksilver from the payment "of all
duties, even including the duty of the fifth, or the proportion
which the miner is bound to pay ;" and annulled "all disposi.
(ions which opposed free trade in said-mineral, and the security
of absolute and pepetu&al ownership (dominio absoluto y perpetuo)
of the miner; provided, that in managing and working them,
he observe the general rules established on the subject."
In the communication from the Secretary of the Regency;
transmitting to the Royal Tribunal-General of Ney. Spain this
decree, he says:
"Under this date I notify your Excellency, that the prerogative of Seignory, which from remote times the Vice-Royal Trea
sury has reserved to itself with respect to mines of quicksilver,
has been annulled by the General and Extraordinary Cortes, in
consequence of the resolution and manifestation of the Council
of Regency, enacting at the same time that the said mines shall
le vorked under the same rules and ordinances as those of gold,
silver, and other metals, and that their possessors shall preserve
their ownership and usufruct (propiedad y usufructo,) and in no
case shall they be obliged to alienate them to the State-giving
them permission moreover to sell their products to any one who
will pay the highest price for them. This measure affirms in a
manner inqiolablethe ownership (propiedad) and profits (utiidad)
of this kind of real estate (de talis juicas), and dispels the reasonable fears which prevented individuals from taking them
under their care."
It would not be easy to find words to express more strongly
the notion of a permanent and inviolate right of property, than
the language of this decree and communication. Orden. de Min-,
pp. 79-82; Halleck's Mining Laws, pp. 381-385.
One of the principal causes of forfeiture established by the
Ordinances of 15 84, was the failure to work the mine for four
consecutive months. But even this provision, so necdssary tc

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
secure the great object of the Crown in conceding the mine, viz..
the development of the mineral resources of the country, was
regarded as highly penal, and therefore to be strictly construed.
It was thus easily evaded, for by working the mine for a few
days every four months the forfeiture was avoided. This defect
was remedied in the Ordinance of 1783, which declared that the
omission to work for eight months, whether successive or inter
rupted, in any one year, should forfeit the mine; but the Judge,
before whom the mine was denounced, was authorized to admit,
in additioni to the excuses allowed by the former law, any "other
just causes which, combined with their former merit, might
render the miners Worthy of equitable consideration." Hallecl"
Transc. 244; Ord. of 1783, Art. 15; IHeathf. Gamboa, p. 80-8e.
Some of the other causes of forfeiture were for the breach o "
directions in the Ordinances clearly necessary for the security of
the mine or of the operatives-such as removing the pillars o
supports of the mine, or in other ways neglecting to comply with
the rules of the Ordinances, or the directions of the competent
authorities, as to their security and preservation, and their better
working. Ord. of 1783, Arts. 7, 10, 11, 12, 18, 14, 15; Halleck's Transc. 342, et sey.
In some cases these forfeitures were only imposed after
repeated offences, (Art. 10,) and all the facts were to be judicially
ascertained in appropriate proceedings.
From the foregoing it results, that although "the observance
of the Ordinances," was in strictness a condition of the concession, yet in fact the forfeiture of the mine was a punishment or
penalty imposed for violations of salutary and necessary rules,
incurred in but a limited number of cases, and when no equitaable considerations existed for mitigating their rigor.
A determinable fee, however, determined by the act or event
expressed in its limitation, usually beyond the control of the
tenant, and the occurrence of which could not be imputed to him
as a fault, still less as a violation of law.
The annexing- of conditions subsequent to grants, seems to
have been a policy by no means peculiar to Spanish jurisprudeuce with regard to mines. It was intended to provide a

security for the attainment of those object wio
consideration for the grant.
These, in colonization grants, were generglly o.cipaton ai.d
,sultivation. In Florida and Louisiana, the settlements were
made under a preliminary concession or warrants of purvey, and
on the fulfillment of the conditions, the final or perfect title wa
issued.
In Mexico, however, under the Law of 1824, and the,)eguations of 1828, a perfect title issued in the first instance, bu
charged with conditions as to occupation and settlement; 4nd
the grant provided that "if the grantee failed to comply with
the conditions, he should lose his right to the land, and it migJ t
be denounced by another."
I am unable to perceive any substantial difference betwggn
the estate of the colonization grantee and that of the me.owner. Both liable to denouncement and forfeiture for noncompliance with the conditions expressed in or annexed by law
to the grant; and in both cases, equitable excuses could, in
general, be received for the omission.
In the California land cases, the existence in the grants of conditions subsequent has never been regarded as presenting any
obstacle to their confirmation-where no forfeiture had accrued
and been judicially ascertained under the former Government.
Having thus ascertained the nature of the mine-owner's estate
in the mine, we are next to consider what was the nature of '
mine itself, considered as a subject of property.
From the quality of the estate, and the fact that it possessed
all the incidents of an estate in land-that it was alienable
devisable, and inheritable-that it could be leased, charged with
a rent, mortgaged, and given as a portion in marriage, etc., it
might reasonably be concluded that the Spanish law, like the
English, regarded the mine as "land." But all doubt is removed
by recurring to the terms which were applied to it. It is a
"fundo," o'r land. 1 Gamb., ch. v., sec 5; id. ch. xxi., sec. 15.
"bienes raices," or real estate. Id. ch. xvii., sec. 22. It is

applied to it, ch. xxiii., sees. 1, 6, 19; and in these cases the pro.
ceedings may be for the ore, or merely to substantiate the right
of property in the mine, (sobre los metales 6 puramente sobre la
propiedad.) Ch. xxiii., sees. 20, 21.
The fact that a judicial delivery of possession was authorized
to be made, indicates that the thing to which the title or right of
property had attached was a corporeal hereditament. It is laid
down by Alvarez (ITst. v. 11, p. 23, et seq.) as an axiom of
the civil law, that "only things corporeal can be delivered,
since only-these can be transferred by corporeal act from one to
another." And this corresponds with the rule of the common
law, that corporeal hereditaments pass by livery of seizih, while
incorporeal hereditaments lie only in grant.
As the Ordinances gave to the miner the right of property in
and possession of the mine, the judicial delivery of the mine,
after the title to the thing had been acquired by denouncement
and registry, vested the mine-owner with the right in the thing,
and gave him the full dominion-the title to and the right in
the thing, the right to dispose of it, and the right to use-dominio
d;.recto y util. It is unnecessary to pursue this discussion further.
No one, I think, who examines the Ordinances and the Commentaries of Gamboa with care, can avoid the conclusion that
the mine-owner, by denouncement and registry, and the delivery
of the possession to him, obtained, under the Mexican law, a
right to and property in the mine, and that the mine so acquired
oonsisted of the very substance of the minerals of which it was
eomposed-was a corporeal hereditament like a mine or stratum
of ores in the English law, and was land in the strictest and
fullest sense of the term.
The case of Fremont vs. The United States, (17 How. 565,) is
*relied on by the counsel of the United States as sustaining his
objection to the jurisdiction. In that case the Court say: "In
relation to that part of the argument which disputes the right
on the ground that the grant embraced mines of gold and silver,
it is sufficient to say, that under the mining laws of Spain, the
discovery of a mine of gold or silver did not destroy the title
of the indiv'dual to the land granted. The only question before

DECEMBER TERM,. 1862.

233

The United Slates -vs. Andres Castillero.
the Court is the'validity of the title. And whether there be any
mines on this land, and if there be any, what are the rights of
sovereignty in them, are questions which must be discussed in
another form of proceeding, and are not subjected to the jurisdiction of the Commissioners or the Court, by the Act of 1851."
It will be seen thab the only question before the Court was
whether the fact that mines of gold and silver had been discovered on land which had been previously granted under the
colonization laws, destroyed the title of the individual to the.
land'granted. It was of course held that it did not. Whether
there were any outstanding rights of sovereignty in such mines,
and, if so, what was their nature, and in what sovereign they
were vested, the Court declared itself without jurisdiction to
determine.
But it was not decided, nor could it have been internded to be
decided, that a private grantee of a mine under Mexican law
could not present his claim for confirmation under the Act of
1851. That question was not before the Court. And even if
the language is to be 'construed as extending to a right to a mine
acquired under Mexican law by a private individual, and is not
to be restricted, as its terms imply, to rights of sovereignty outstanding in the United States or the State of California, it must
be regarded as obitar dictum-not necessary to the determination of the cage, and relating to a question which did not and
could not have been presented by it.
A similar decision of the point presented for determination
had already been made by the Supreme Court in Delassus vs.
The United States, (9 Pet. 117.) The claim in that case was, like
that of Fremont, for the confirmation of a concession of a tract
of land. It differed from the case of Fremont in the circumstance that the motive of the petitioner in soliciting the grant
was declared to be to make explorations for lead mines.
But the Court held that the concession was for an-1; and an
all claims for lands were s ibmitted to its jurisdiction, without
any reservation in the Act :f Congress of claims for lands contamining lead mines, a confirmation could not be withheld.
In I?-emont's case the same objection-viz.: that the land

SUPREME COURT.
The Uniled States vs. Andres Castillero.
grmnted contained .ines-was taken, and the Court held, that
that circtumstance did not impair the validity of the grant, or
divest its jurisdiction over it as of a claim to land. Such, it
seems clear to me, was the whole scope and effect of the decision.
The nature of a claim to a mine, as distinguished from the
right of an agricultural grantee to the surface, and the jurisdiction over such a claim confided to the Commissioners by the
Act of 1851, were not tonsidered, or intended to be decided.
My conclusions, then, on the question of jurisdiction, are1. That the jurisdiction of this Court is not restricted to those
cases where the estate claimed in lands in California is a fee-or
such as in equity should be converted into a fee.
2. r4%at-even if it were, the estate of a mine-owner in a mine
is, under Mexican and Spanish law, a fee with conditions subse
quent; zlosely resembling that of a grantee under the colonization laws.
8. That by the common law of England the ownership of the
surface may be vested in one person, and that of the mine, or
substratum of mineral in another; and that the latter is "land"
in its strictest sense.
4. That by the Spanish and Mexican laws, a mine, considered
as a subject of property, and distinct from the ownership of thE
surface, is "land," or rather, that terms are applied to it in those
laws which are the precise equivalents of the common law term
"land."
And that therefore this Court has jurisdiction to ascertain andt
settle a private land claim to a mine, the title to which is
derived from the Spanish or Mexican Governments, as of'a
claim to "lan12d."
Having thus ascertained that a mine, is "land," and that the
estate of the mine-owner closely resembled a conditional fee at
common law, we will next briefly inquire by what proceedings
and in what manner that estate was acquired.
Such an inquiry naturally precedes an examination into the
genuineness of the alleged title to the mine, and the determina
tion of its legal effect if found to be genuine.

,nodes of acquiring mines-of new discoveries, reg-.strieq of
veins, and denouncement of mines abandoned or forfeited," is
as follows:
"Those mentioned in the preceding articles must appear with
a written statement before the Deputation of Mining of that
Territory, or the one nearest, if there should be none there,
stating in it their name and those of their partners, if they
have any; the place of their birth, their residence, profession
and employment; and the most particular and distingu:shing
features of the place (sitio), hill (cerro), or vein, of which they
ask the adjudication. All of which circumstances, and the hour
at which the discoverer presents himself, shall be noted in a
book of registry, which the Deputation and Notary (Escribano)
of Mines, if there be one, shall keep, and this being done, his
written statement shall be returned to the discoverer for his due
security, and notices shall be fixed to the doors of the chur.h,
Governmeit houses, and other public places of the town, for due
information. And I order that within ninety days he shall
have made in the vein or veins of the registry, a pit (poso) of a
vara and a half wide, or in diameter, and ten varas down, or in
depth; and that as soon as this is done, one of the Deputies
shall personally go, accompanied by the Notary, if there be one
-and if there be none, by two assisting witnesses and a profes
sional mining expert of that Territory-to inspect the course
and direction of the vein, itswidth, its inclination to the hori
zon, which is called echado or recuesto, its hardness or softness,
the greater or less firmness of its sides, and the species or principal indications of the mineral-taking an exact account of all
this, in order that it may be added to the corresponding part of
its registry, with the evidence (fg) of possession, which shall
immediately be given in my Royal name, measuring to him his
pertenencias, and causing him to fix stakes (estacas) in his boundaries, as will hereafter be mentioned; which being done, there
will be delivered to him an attested copy of the prcceedings as
a corresponding title.

hearing in Court, and it shall be adjudicated to the one who
best proves his claim; but, if he appear after that time, he shall
not be heard.
Art. 7 provides, that when a question shall arise as to who is
the first discoverer, he shall be held such who shall have first
found metal in the vein-and in case of doubt, he who shall
first have registered it.
It is well said by one of the counsel ft, the claimants, that
the object of the various Mining Ordinances of Spain was to
stimulate and promote to the utmost extent the discovery of
mines and the development of their riches.
The means adopted to stimulate discovery were to give to the
discoverer the mine he might discover-the State reserving for
itself a small part of its products. The means by which the
development of the riches of the mine was secured, consisted in
making the continuance of the right of property dependent on
working it to the extent and in the manner prescribed by law.
Discovery, therefore, was recognized by those laws as the real
foundation of the right, and the true consideration for the grant
of property in a mine.
Gamboa considered the discoverers of mines as entitled even
to greater encouragement than the inventors of useful arts.
Heathf. Gamb. 1, p. 259. And in all the Mining Ordinances of
Europe, the right of the discoverer is recognized by the promise
of a grant of the mine as a reward for the discovery.
In the Sala Afejicana, vol. 2, p. 58, discovery is declared to be
one of the modes of acquiring mines, and it is recognized as a
species of occupation, and as constituting a source of title, like
the finding of a buried treasure, precious stones, and the like.
In the jurisprudence of Spain and the Continental Nations,
discovery, with regaid to mines, as a source of title and consideration for the grant, corresponds with occupation and cultivation under our own pre-emption laws with regard to vacant
public lands; and in all the claims to lands in Florida and
Louisiana submitted to the Supreme Court, the fact of settlemeat, under a contract for or with a just right to expect a title

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
has been regarded as a valuable consideration secured by the
State, and creating an equitable obligation to confer the title.
But this inchoate right created by discovery must be perfected
in the manner prescribed by law.
It is therefore required that the mine be registered; and with.
out registry, says Gamboa, no mine could be lawfully worked,
and it remains liable to be registered by any other person-the
form of the ordinance not having been complied with. Chap.
v., -ec. 2. The reasonableness of this regulation, he remarks,
is evident. It is not necessary to recapitulate the various argu.
ments by which he vindicates its policy and necessity.
As the revenue was interested in a portion of the product of
the mine; as the public policy required that an account should
be taken of so important a part of the national wealth; as the
mine-owner, from the moment of registry, became' subject to,
laws designed to secure the development of the mine he had
discovered; for these and other reasons, it was indispensable 1o
provide a mode in which the discovery should be formally made
known to competent authority and the. right of the discoverer
judicially declared and defined. Registry is, therefore, said by
Gamboa to be the fundamental title, or the base of the title (el
titulo fundamental de las minas), and the attributive cause of
the subject's right of property in it; for the Crown has conceded
the mines and made them common, subject to this burden ox
condition (gravamen). Ch. v., see. 2.
And in other places he speaks of registry as "el titulo fundgmental de el dominio de las minas." Ch. xi., see. 2-; ch. vii.,
see. 3.
The registry, however, did not constitute the title to the mine
in the sense of being itself a concession or grant.
The registry, or formal declaration of the discovery in the
manner prescribed by law, was the fulfillment of the condition
imposed in the general grant by the Sovereign on the discoverer
of mines, and on its performance the law itself annexed the title
as the legal consequence of discovery and registry: It still
remained subject to further conditions-some to be performed

before a formal delivery of possession could be given, and some
to be perpetually observed under penalty of forfeiture.
The registry was therefore required to be made before a
judicial tribunal, and not before an administrative officer, who,
like the Governors of California, might exercise a discretion as
to whether or not the concession should be made. The declaration of the ownership of the discoverer was termed an "adjudication," and even after registry, and at any time during the
period allowed the person registering for digging the pit, any
person pretending to have a right to the discovery, was entitled
to a hearing "in Court," and the mine was adjudicatedto him who
best proved his claim.
In sec. 14 of chap. v., Gamboa states that "registries of mines
in the Indies are not to be made before royal officers, but before
the Justices of the Department alone; and the oath of the
discoverer, that he will bring in to be stamped all the gold and
silver, etc., is to insure the due levying of duties, and is not to
be made upon the registry of a mine, the title to which comes under
,Ike cognizance of the Justice."

In section 15, he says: "But judicial matters, such as registry,
denouncement, the giving possession, etc., axe the province of
te justices, and, by way of appeal, of the royal audiences."
In sec. 24, he defines registry to be "any judicial order, or
proceedings (autos 6 diligencia,) which authenticate and afford
evidence of some judicial act."
The whole proceeding thus seems to have been the judicial
recognition and declaration of a previously existing righit,
asserted and established in the manner rrequired by law, rather
than the creation and conferring of a title which had no pre.
-vious existence.
Thus, Gamboa, in speaking of the necessity of registering
says: "And therefore, the discoverer, if he would presemre his
right, should give notice of his discovery, and make himself
known." Ca. v., 4.
So, in see 17 of the same chapter-" If, after the expiration

of the term of twenty days, some other person should come
forward and register, the discoverer loses his right, this being

the penalty he is liable to pay for his culpable default, in
neglecting to register his mine, and thus frustating the ends of
the ordinances; for a mine which is worked without being
registered, is not properly to be called a mine, and does not
merit the name, even though it should yield good ore.
"The ordinances give the name of mines to such only as are
registered, because the registry is the fundamental title (el titulo
fundamental) to every mine; and because the omitting to make
registry evinces a vicious intention to dispose of the ore ot
silver clandestinely, in fraud of the right of the Crown,. and to
put impediments in the way of other individuals who might
wish to take mines upon the same vein, or at the same spot."1.Heathf. Gamb. p. 150.

is "statement" is, by the Ordinances of 1783, to be returned
to him, after its contents have been duly noted in !he register,
"for his security," and when he shall have dug his pit he is to
be put in possession,,if no adverse claim be interposed. But
the only evidence of his title consists in the judicial ascertain.
ruent and record of* the fact that he declared his discovery in"
the form required by law, which being done, the law itself gave
the title on the conditions fixed by the ordinances. When the
pit had been dug, and judicial possession given, the 4th Article
of the Ordinances of 1783, directed, as we have seen, that ami
authorized copy of all the proceedings (de las dilgencias) should
be given him as his corresponding title (como titulo corre~pon
diente). To perfect and secure the right to a mine, registry
was, in all cases, indispensable. In making it, all that was
necessary was "to manifest the person, the place, and the ore."
But if the mine had previously been worked, and was denounced
for abandonment or other cause of forfeiture, a preliminary
proceeding called a denouncement was required. This was in
the nature of an accusation against the former owner, charging
him with having left the mine unworked, or having come within
somc o.her ground of forfeiture. Upon this question a summarv

SUPREME COURT.

judgment was had, after notice to neighbors, proclamation, etc.
If the mine was declared forfeited, the denouncer was, nevertheless, obliged to register it and go through the same proceedings
as the discoyerer had done. Heathf. Gamboa, ch. v.., sects. 21-22, p. 153.
That the discoverer of a mine was recognized by the law as
having acquired a right to it, even before registry, "sfurther
shown by the terms of-the 20th Ordinance of 1584, which enacts
that "No person shall presume to register, or to enter in the
register a mine which is not his own property, under the penalty
of one thousand ducats," etc.
Among the cases mentioned by Gamboa, to which this law
applies, is that of a person other than the discoverer of the ore
registering a mine before the expiration of the twenty days
allowed by the ordinance to a discoverer for registering his
mine. 1 Heathf.Gamboa, pp. 156, 158.
The discoverer is thus treated as the true owner of the mine,
until, by failing to register within the time prescribed, his rights
are lost; and the registry of the mine within that time by any
person in his own name is considered and punished as a fraudulent attempt to acquire the property of another, like a similar
act by the mortgagee of the mine, or by the curator or tutor of
a minor, and other cases mentioned by Gamboa.
From these and many other provisions in the ordinances and
passages in7 the Commentaries of Gamboa, the nature and effect
of registry is unmistakably manifested; nor can our views of it
depend upon the- meaning we attach.to a single phrase of
Gamboa (el titulo fundamental), as to the correct translation of
which a question was raised at the bar.
The foundation of the right to a mine was discovery. But
this right was lost unless the discoverer made known the fact
before the judicial tribunal authorized to receive such declarations. The proceeding for the purpose was entirely ex-parte,
and consisted merely of a production of the ore, a description
of the place where it was liscovered, and the pcson of the discoverer. These facts being duly made known and recorded, the
title passed by operation of law, unless within the time limited1

some one having a better right appeared. The foundation of
the denouncer's right was in principle the same.
. Having brought to the notice of the Court, and established
that a mine was abandoned or had been forfeited, the law gave
him the right to register it in his own name, like a new mine,
except that not being an original discoverer, the mining space
(pertenencias) to be assigned to him was more limited.
The registry cannot be regarded as the base of the title to the
mine, in the sense, that without registry a right of property
could, in no case, be asserted to it; for. as we have seen, even
after registry by an alleged discoverer, and after he had dug his
pit, obtained judicial possession, and even had his pertenencias
measured, any one pretending to have a right to the discovery,
could within ninety days from the date of the registry assert his
claim and procure the mine to be adjudicated to him; but where
no objection was interposed, and the person registering was the
true discoverer of the mine, the causing it to be registered, or
the formal declaration of his discovery, was the fulfillment of
the condition established by law upon which his inchoate right
as a discoverer became a perfect right of property (although
until the pit was dug he was not entitled to a judicial delivery
of possession, nor could he alienate the mine). And the register
itself/or the record of the procedure, became his fundamental
title paper, or evidence of his title, for it established judicially the
fact of the' discovery, and the fact that he had declared it as re
quired by law.
I have thus endeavored to arrive at a clear conception of the
nature and effect of the registry of a mine, and of the rights of a
discoverer, that we may be better able to judge of the validity
of the alleged registry by Castillero, and correctly to estimate
the equitable or inchoate rights he may have acquired as the
discoverer of a new mine.
Having premised this much as to the rights of a discoverer, and
the nature, objects and effect of a registry we will now particularly consider the provisions of the articles under examination.
It will be observed, that to effect a registry, and to entitlb
himself to the judicial delivery of possession of the. mine, the

only acts 'required of the discoverer were: 1st, his appearance
before the Deputation, with a written statement of the" facts
necessary to set forth ; and 2d, that he should within ninety days
thereafter, make a pit in the vein of his registry of the required
dimensions.
The noting in the book of registry of the contents of the statement, the hour at which the discoverer presented himself, the
notices for due information, etc., were acts to be performed by
the Judge or Deputation. It would seem that any injurious
effect on the discoverer's right by the omission of the first of
these formalities, was intended to be provided against by the
direction that the written statement should "be returned to him
for his due security," and it is presumed, with a certificate
annexed of the fact and time of its presentation.
We learn from Gamboa, that in 1727, the Viceroy Marquess
of Cassa Forte issued an order, dated at Mexico, commanding
the royal officers and justices to send an account of the mines
within their several districts, whether at work or abandoned, etc.;
and in case they should have no book of registry for the mines
which might have been registered there, to form one with all
possible dispatch, that an account might thus be obtained of all
the mines in the kingdom, from which a general book might be
made up, etc. "But we are not aware," says Gamboa, "that this
order, so agreeable to the spirit of the Ordinances now under
consideration, and so important to the interests of the revenue
in a public, and of the subject in a private point of view, was
soon carried into effect." We find here no intimation that the
failure of the officer to enter the registry in a book in any way
impairied its validity, and this, notwithstanding that the ordinance he was considering (Art. xix,) expressly requires the
Mining Administrators of each District to keep a book in which
all registries made in such District were to be entered, and for
this purpose the miners were required to send authenticated
copies of such registry to -that officer.
Gamboa goes :) to observe, that "the original proceedings
kdiligencias) ought not to be given into the custody of the
owners -until the registry, -etc., be -made in the proper book; far

otherwise these important instruments would be exposed to the
contingencies alluded to above, and very serious difficulties may
arise in subsequent dealings in ascertaining whether the registry
or denouncement was made with due solemnity, the time and
manner of making it, the greater or less antiquity of the
mine," &c.
This suggestion appears to have been adopted in the Ordinances of 1783, which provide, as we have seen, that the contents
of the statement and the hour at which it was presented, shall
first be noted 'in the book of registry, and the statement then
retprned to the discover "for his due security."
The registry having been effected, the working of the mine
could lawfully be commenced at once, and within ninety days
the pit was required to be dug. As soon as this was done
formal'possession could be given.
If, however, the party who had registered the mine failed to
do this, his rights were, by the Ordinances of 1584, forfeited
•nd the mine might be denounced by and adjudged to another.
As, however, from the nature of the vein, a pit of the depth of
three estados might be wholly unnecessary, or the hardness of
the rock, the caving in of the pit, the breaking out of springs
of water, &c., might prevent the digging of the pit within the
time limited, it was provided by the ordinance, that the justice,
on an application made to him, and an investigation, might dispense with this requirement of the law, or enlarge the time for
its fulfillment, as might be necessary.
In the Ordinances of 1783, the penalty of forfeiture is not in
terms imposed for the omission to dig the pit within ninety
days. It is presumed, however, that a breach of so positive and
important a provision of law would, if without excuse, under
the later ordinances have rendered the mine liable to denouncement.
By Art. 4, of the Ordinances of 1783, the pertenencias of the
mine were required to be measured, and the stakes fixed in the
boundaries at the time possession is given.
By the Ordinances of 1584, the miner was not obliged to do
this, until cited by some neighboring miner "who asked for

SUPREME COURT.

stakes. Ten days were then allowed him to select the ground
he might prefer, or, using, our mode of expression, to locate his
pertenencias-subject, however, to the condition that his original
pit of possession, or fixed stake, should be within the lmits of
the boundaries he might select. If he failed to make his selec.
tion within ten days, his boundaries were established by the
justice. But this designation of his pertenencias was not final ;
for he might at any time afterwards, on discovering the true
course of the vein, &c., apply to have his stakes bettered (meJorar las estacas), and his boundaries might be altered in any
way not injurious to the neighbor, between whose mine and hip
own the boundaries had already been established.-1 Heathf.
Gamb., pp. 297, 298, 325; 2 Heathf. Gamb., p. 10.
The frauds and litigation to which this practice gave rise led
Gamboa to suggest that every one should, by positive ordinance,
be required to set out his b,, idaries at the time possession was
given, under pain of incurring the forfeiture of the mine and of
being ipso facto deprived of it, even though not denounced by
any other party. 2 Heathf., pp. 10, 11.
This suggestion was adopted in the Ordinances of 1783, except that the omision to set out the boundaries at the time possession is given, was not declar d to forfeit the mine ipso fach.
But, notwithstanding this establishment of boundaries, the
miner could improve the location of his stakes (mejorar las
ostacas) or change his boundaries by the authority of the Depu.ation of the District, provided it could be done without injury
to his neighbors, who were to be summoned and heard in the
matter. Ord. of 1783, art. 11, Halleck's Transc., p. 236.
It thus appears that the giving possession was, under the
Ordinances, a formal proceeding, like a livery of seizin, of which
the measurement of pertenencias, or the establishment of boundaries, did not of necessity form a part; and that although these
acts were required to be done by the Ordinances of 1784, their
omission did not forfeit the right of property acquired by the
registry; still less does it appear that their performance was a
condition precedent to the vesting of the title.

ization laws, a formal judicial delivery of possession was in
strictness required. But it has never been held by the Supreme
Court that this formality was necessary to vest the title or right
of property; and in the majority of cases passed upon by this
Court it was not given. In its own nature, it was an act which
supposed the existence of a title acquired, but had no effect in
conferring one, that having already been done by the concession
or grant. I see no reason to make any distinction between, the
judicial delivery of possession of an agricultural grant and that
of a mine, or for considering that the omission of that formality
would be fatal to a right of property already acquired in the
one case more than in the other.
We shall see, however, when we examine the proofs in this
case, that the Alcalde, accompanied by witnesses of assistance,
gave to Castillero judicial possession of the mine he had discovered, as well as of three thousand varas in all directions from
it, which he undertook to grant him; that no pertenencias were
measured or stakes fixed, but that Castillero had already commenced working the mine and had dug a pit, the precise dimensions of which do not appear; that he continued in possession,
and working his mine, with the full knowledge not only of the
authorities of the Department to whom he made known his discoveiy, but of the American Consul, and the inhabitants generally; and that this possession hat been retained by his assigns
and representatives to this day.
I proceed to consider the evidence as to the registry of the
mine by Andres, Castillero, and having ascertained what was in
fact done by him, to determine its validity and effect.
The documents relied on by the claimants as constituting the
registry of the mine of New Almaden, are:
1st. A written statement by Andres Castillero, addressed to
the Alcalde of the First Nomination of the Pueblo of San Jos6,
dated November 22d, 1845, setting forth his name, office and
residence, and the fact that he had dicovered a vein of silver
with a, ley of gold on the land of the retired sergeant Jos6
Reves Berreyesa, which he desired to work in company.. Ho

th3refore requests the Alcalde to fix up the proper notices in
order that his right might be made sure when the time for
giving the judicial possession should arrive.
2d. A second statement addressed by Castillero to the same
officer, and dated December 3d, 1845, setting forth that on
opening the mine previously denounced by him he had taken
out, ba3id -s silver with'a ley of gol4, liquid quicksilver. He
therefore asks the Alcalde to unite this representation to the
previous denouncement and to place it on file.
3d. The act of juridical possession. In this document the
Alcalde recites:
"There being no Mining Deputation in the Department of
California, and this being the only time since the settlement of
Upper California that a mine has been worked in conformity
with the laws, and there being no Juez de Letras, (Professional
Judge) in the Second District, I, the Alcalde of First Nomination, citizen Antonio Maria Pico, accompanied by two assisting
witnesses, have resolved to act in virtue of my office, for want
of a Notary Public, there being none, for the purpose of giving
juridical possession of the mine, known by the name of Santa
Clara, in this jurisdiction, situated on the land of the retired
Sergeant Jos6 Reyes Berreyesa, the time having expired which
is designated in the Ordinance of Mining for citizen Don Andres
Castillero to show his right, and also for others to allege a better
right between the time of denouncement and this date; and the
mine being found with abundance of metals discovered, the shaft
made according to the rules of art, and the working of the mine
producing a large quantity of liquid quicksilver, as shown by
the specimens which the Court has; and as the laws now in
force so strongly recommend the protection of an article so
necessary for the amalgamation of gold and silver in the Republic, I have granted three thousand varas of land in all
directions, subject to what the general Ordinance of Mines may
direct, it being worked in company, to which I certify, the
witnesses signing with me; this Act of Possessidn being attached
to the rest of the espediente, deposited in the archives under

These documents are produced from the Recorder's Office of
Santa Clara county. They were found in the Mayor's office at
that place in 1850, by Capt. H. W. Halleck, and by the Mayor
transferred to the Recorder's office, where they now remain. It
appears that a large portion of the archives or papers belonging
to the former Alcalde's office in San Jos6, were deposited in the
Mayor's office of that place, a knowledge of which circumstance
induced Capt. Halleck to institute a search in the latter place,
which-resulted in the discovery of the document.
The espediente thus produced contains several papers besides
those enumerated above. These papers will hereafter be referred to.
In investigating the genuineness of these documents, it will
be convenient to consider:
1st. The proof of the signatures attached to them.
2d. The evidence tending to establish that the documents were
executed at the time they bear date, and were filed or ardcived
in the Alcalde's office. And
3d. The proofs which show that, in: fact, the mine was discov:
ered and denounced, and the judicial possession given, as stated
in the Act of Possession.
The Act of Possession is signed- by Antonio Maria Pico, as
Alcalde, and by Jos6 Noriega an& Antonio Suflol, assisting
witnesses. All these persons have been sworn, and testify to the
genuineness of their signatures; and that they were- affixed on
the day the instrument bears date. The. genuineness of these
signatures, and that of Castillero, is also proved by other witnessrs.
I do not understand that the fact that the instruments-were

testified iot only to their own signatures, but to the facts whiob
the documents recite. The theory of the Government, *vhich
supposes these statements to be false, must admit their readinests
to affix..their names to ante-dated documents.
The real questions, therefore, are, when were these documents
prepared and signed ? and when were they placed in the Alcalde's
office ?
1 2. On this point we have, as. before stated, the evidence of
Pico, the Alcalde, and the two subscribing witnesses, Suiol and
Noriega.
We have also the testimony of Jos6 Fernandez, who was Sindico del Juzgado and Escribano of the Court in 1845. This
witness not only swears to the handwriting of the documents
and the genuineness of the signatures, but states that he saw the
espediente in 1845, when it was brought to him by Gutierrez, in
whose handwriting the body of the decree is. He also swears
that he saw it again in 1849, among the archives of the office,
he being then Second Alcalde.
James W. Weekes, a witness called by the Government, testifies that he saw the espediente in 1846-7, when Burton was
Alcalde, and in 1848, when he was himself Alcalde. He is
unable, however, positively to identify the espediente now pro.
duced with the "little book" which he saw in the office when
Burton was Alcalde. This witness, in 1848, certified, at the
request of Mr. James Alexander Forbes, to a copy of the. espediente. Tie copy was prepared by James Alexander Forbes
from a document handed to him by Alexander Forbes, of Tepic,
(who was 'then'in California), not from the original in the
Alcalde's office. The certificate of Weekes, that it was a faithful
and literal copy of the latter document, was obtained, but no
comparison was made of the copy made by Mr. Forbes with the
original; the witness supposing, as he states, that it was correct.
The copy thus certified to by Weekes differs from that found in
the Alcalde's office in several particulars, which will hereafter
be noticed.
The claimants have also produced the original inventory of
papers and effects in the Alcalde's office, which, as was custom

ary, was on the 1st of January, 1846, signed by the out-going
Alcalde, Pico, and receipted by the in-coming Alcalde, Chavolla.
This document is produced by the Clerk of the City of San
Jos6. It was found amongst other papers which had accumulated under the government of the Alcaldes of the Pueblo, and
which now form part of the archives of the city. The signatures and rubrics of Pico and Chavolla to the inventory are
proved; and the document itself is in the handwriting of Jos6
Fernandez, the Escribano or Secretary of the Juzgado.
In this inientory, amongst nearly a hundred entries of paper&
and records, and of the smallest objects belonging to the office
-- such as candlesticks, old knives, tables and benches-is found
a note of a document entitled "Pesecion de la mina de Santa
Clara 6 Don Andres Castillero."
No attempt has been made to impeach the genuineness of the
signatures to this document, nor is it said that there is anything
in the handwriting of the important entry in question, or in its
position on this list, which could suggest the idea of a possible
interpolation. Unless this entry be forged, it would seem conclusive evidence that a document of the kind described was on
file inthe Alcalde's office on the 1st of January, 1846.
Another inventony, of a similar kind, made on the 10th day
of November, 1846, about nine months subsequently to the former,
has been produced by the United States from the archives of
San Jos6.
In this inventory, no entry of the document iii question is
found. If the lists were in other respects similar, the omission
of this one item might possess much significance. But the two
lists seem to be different in many particulars; and though some
of the entries are alike in both, several which appear in the Arst
are wanting in the second. That all the papers mentioned in
the first inventory must have existed on the files of the office,
and should have been noted in the second inventory, is evident.
When, therefore, we find not only the "Posecion" of the Mina
de Santa Clara, but several other documents, omitted in the
second inventory, we necessarily conclude that the latter was
repured in the loose and inaccurate manner in which the

SUPREME COURT.

public business. of such offices was usually conducted in-. those
primitive times,
A 'striking illustration of the incompleteness of the second
inventory is presented by the evidence offered by theUnited
States. Three 'documents are produced from. the Archives of
San Jos6, purporting to be orders by the Alcalde for the publication of the denouncements of mines-one of the lands of Justo
Larios, another on those of Jos6 de J. Vallejo, and a third on
the rancho de Ojo de la Coche. These orders are dated in
April, March and June, 1846. I find no one of them noted 'in
the inventory made in the succeeding November. And yet,
both the documents and the inventory are produced as genuine
by the United States.
I can see nothing, therefore, in the omission of the entry of
the possession of the mine of Santa Clara in the second inventory which, in the absence of any suggestion that the handwriting or the color of the ink of the entry in the first inventory
differs from those of the rest of the document, (as would be the
case if it had been interpolated after any considerable interval,)
or that the position of the entry on the list would have rendered
such an interpolation possible, should weaken the force of the
evidence afforded by the inventory that a document, purporting
to be the possession of the mine of Santa Clara, was on file in
the Archives of the Alcalde's office of San Jos6 on the 1st January, 1846
3d. As to the proofs which show the facts of denouncement,
judicial possession and working of the mine about the time
indicated by the documents.
We have already seen that the subscribing witnesses, the
Alcalde and Jos6 Fernandez, testify to the fact that the posses.
sion was given as described by them.
It is shown, however, by evidence, which is uncontroverted,
that in December, 1845, and early in 1846, Castille'_) and his
partners were notoriously known to be working a mine of
quicksilver, of which they claimed to be the owners by de
uouncement. That these facts were made known to the Gov
ernor of the Department, and by him communicated to the

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
Supreme Government. That they were known to the United
States Consul, and by him communicated to his own Govern,
ment, and also to a Cabinet Minister of the Government of the
Sandwich Islands, with whom he corresponded, and by whom
his letter was published in a Hawaiian newspaper of the date of
July 25th, 1846, a copy of which is produced. That the mine
was, in December, 1845, worked by Indians under the superin
tendence of Chard, an American employed by Castillero, who is
produced as a witness, and whose employment continued until
about the middle of 1846. That in .December, 1845, it was
visited and examined by Col. J. C. Fremont, to whom Castillero..
who claimed to own it, explained the Mexican mode of acquiring
titles to mines by denouncement and registry, but declined some
overtures for its purchase made to him by Fremont.
Other allusions to and recognition of the possession and grant
of three thousand varas, in letters, judicial proceedings, &C, at a
late period, but previous to the supposed date of their fabrication, will subsequently be considered.
Among the documents alleged to have come from the City of
Mexico, traced copies of which are exhibited, was a communication from Pio Pico, Governor of the Californias, to the Minister
of Relations, dated February 13, 1846. In this letter Governor
Pico states that he incloses a letter from Don Andres Castillero,
apprising him of the important discovery of a quicksilver mine,
aad transmitting a sample of the quicksilver. He therefore begs
the Minister of Relations to bring it to the superior knowledge
of His Excellency the President, &c.
On the margin of this letter is the usual note, stating- its
reception on the 6th of April, 1846, and that it is noted with
satisfaction, &c. The letter of Castillero alluded to in the foregoing, dated 10th December, 1845, is also produced from the
Mexican Archives. On searching the Archives in this City, for
records of this correspondence, there was found the borrador, oi
office copy, of the letter from Pio Pico, and a letter from Castil.
lero-not the one inclosed by the Governor in his communication to the Minister of Relations, for of that, he states in that
communication, he sends the original; but a subsequent letter

dated Decembej 15th, 1845. In this letter he states: "I have
the satisfaction of informing you, if you have not received my
other letter through the Prefecture, that i have discovered,"
&c., repeating substantially the contents of the former letter,
which had, in fact, been received and inclosed to the Minister
of Relations. It is not disputed that these documents are in the
Archives. The borrador, or draft, of Pico's communication to
the Minister, is in the. handwriting of Olvera, who was Secretary
of the Assembly at the time.
There was also found, at the same time, by Mr. Hopkins, the
Keeper of the Archives, amongst those records, a letter from
Manuel Castro the Prefect of the Second District, to the Secretary of the Departmental Government, dated December 31, 1845.
In this letter he states that "Castillero has denounced and is
now working a quicksilver mine ;" and after falicitating the
Secretary, and through him the Governor, on so beneficent a
discovery, he adds, that he incloses a petition by Castillero for
two square leagues of land adjacent to his mine. A borrador,
or draft of the reply of the Secretary to this letter is also found
in the archives, but it appears to have been cancelled by black
lines drawn transversely.
The handwriting and the signatures of these documents are
proved by Pio Pico, who also states his recollection of having
dispatched J. M. Covarrubias with his letter of the 13th of February, 1846, to the Minister of Relations, and the bottle of auicksilver sent to him by Castillero.
The testimony of Pico on this point is corroborated by that of
Jos6 M. Covarrubias, who swears that he left San Pedro in the
schooner Juanita, Captain Snook, on the 14th of February, 1846,
taking with him the Governor's dispatch, Castillero's letter, and
a bottle of quicksilver, all of which he delivered on his arrival
at Mexico to the Minister of Relations, Mr. Castillo y Lanzas.
Files of the "Diaro Oficial," the Government newspaper, published in Mexico, and of the "Monitor "Republicano," and the
"Republica-n," also published in Mexico, are produced, and
under the heading of marine news there are found notices of the
arival of the " Tuanita," Captain Snook, at Mazatlan, on the 2d

of March, 1846, twelve days from San Diego; of her departure
on the 12th of the same month from Mazatlan for. San Bias,
having on board as passengers Jos6 Maria Covarrubias and
others.
It cannot, therefore, be doubted that the letter of Castillero
of the 10th of December, 1845, a traced copy of which is produced from the Mexican Archives, wat, Jn fact sent to Governor
Pico, and by him transmitted in Fe6hiary, 1846, to Castillo Lanzas, Minister of Relations, together with the dispatch, the borrador of which is found in the archive!rin this city, and a bottle
of quicksilver.
There are also produced by the claimants two letters from
Castillero to M. G. Vallejo, of Sonoma.
In the first of these, dated December 2, 1845, Castillero says:
"While waiting for the time of my departure, I have employed
myself as a miner, having extracted from the same vein quicksilver, silver, and gold, in surpassing quantities."
In the second letter, dated December 21, 1845, he, amongst
other things, informs Vallejo that he has found such abundance
of quicksilver that he has extracted twenty pounds of it from
twenty arrobas of ore, &c.
These letters are produced and proved by General Vallejo. I
do not understand that the genuineness of Castillero's signatures
to them is disputed. As Castillero left California in the spring
of 1846, and :has never returned, they must have been written
about the time they are dated, unless we suppose they have since,
and after an interval of many years, been written in Mexico,
ante-dated, and sent on to Vallejo to be produced by him-a
supposition which the contents of the letters and the allusions in
them to personal matters and contemporaneous events of slight
importance render wholly inadmissible. .There is also produced
by the claimants a copy of the Polynesian, of the date of July
25th, 1846, which contains a letter from G. P. Judd, the Minister
of Finance of the Hawaiian Kingdom, to the editor of the newspaper, inclosing a letter received- by the Minister from Thomas
0. Larkin, United States Consul at Monterey, dated June 24,
1846. In this letter, which is also published in the Polynesian,

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

MT. Larkin informs Mr. Judd of the discovery of a quicksilver
mine seventy miles north of Monterey, and states, that in 1845,
"a Mexican being in the vicinity examined the rock and immediately denounced the place before the nearest Alcalde, and then
made known what it contained. The owner, with a priest, in a
small and imperfect manner has commenced extracting the
metal." After describing the process adopted by them, he adds:
"They obtain about fifteen per cent. of the metal."
The receipt of this letter in the Sandwich Islands is sworn to
by the editor and publisher of the newspaper. He is wholly
unimpeached. The fact that it was published in the newspaper
on the day alleged,7is sworn to by a gentleman of San Francisco,
who read it,
and whose attention was particularly drawn to it.
A copy of the paper is produced and filed. From among the
papers of the late Mr. Larkin is produced, by his son, the reply
of Mr. Judd to his -father's communication. The reply is dated
July 20, 1846. It acknowledges the receipt of Larkin's letter
of the 24th ultimo, (June,) with a specimen of the ore, and it
states that he had sent it to the editor of the Polynesianfor insertion. The handwriting and signature of Mr. Judd are proved
by persons intimate with him.
It has already been mentioned that files of several Mexican
newspapers, published in 1846, have been produced by the
claimants. In the "Diario del Gobierno de la Republica Mexigana," of the 27th December, 1846, we find credited to the
"Espia de la Frontera," a newspaper not produced, a notice of
the acccount given in the "Polynesian," of the 24th July, of the
discovery of a quicksilver mine seventy miles north of Monterey,
and the same notice purporting to be taken from the same papur,
the "Spy of the Frontier," is found in the "Republicano," of the
9th December, and in the "Monitor Republicano," of the 6th.
It is unnecessary, however, to dwell on these incidental cor.
roborations; for the fact of the reception of Larkin's letter by
Mr. Judd, and its publication in the Polynesian cannot be
doubted.
The claimants have also produced from the files of the State
Department at Washington. extracts from official dispatches of

DECEMBER TERM, .1862.

05

The United States vs. Andres (astillero.
Mr. Thos. 0. Larkin to the then Secretary of State. Taea
extracts are certified by Mr. Cass, November 28, 1859.
The first dispatch of Mr. Larkin is dated May 4, 1846.
The extract produced states that"Near the Mission of Santa Clara there are mountains with
-veins of quicksilver ore, discovered by D. Andres Castillero, of
Mexico, in 1845, which the undersigned has twice seen produce
twenty per cent. of fine quicksilver, &c. * * * * * * * *
By the laws and customs of Mexico respecting mining, every
person or company, foreign or native, can present themselves to
the nearest authorities and denounce any unworked mine. The
authorities will then, after the proper formalities, put the discoverer in possession, &c. * * Up to the present time there
are few or no persons in California with sufficient energy or
capital to carry on mining, although a Mexican officer of the
army, a Padre, and a native of New York, are on a very small
scale extracting quicksilver from the San Jos6 Mine."
There is also produced from the consular book of Mr. Larkin,
a dispatch addressed by him to the American Minister at Mexico,
dated April 3, 1846.
After mentioning the intended departure of Don Andres Castillero from this port (Monterey) in a few days, for Acapulco, on
board the Hawaiian barque Don Quixote, as Commissioner to
Mexico, from General Jos6 Castro, and that he would arrive in
Mexico by the 25th or 30th of this month, (April,) Mr. Larkin
says: "At the town of San Jos6, eighty miles from Monterey,
Doxi Andres Castillero has discovered a quicksilver mine. The
ore produces from fifty to sixty per cent. I have seen him, from
an old gun-barrel, in thirty minutes run out about thirty per
ceat. in pure quicksilver. This must be a great advantage to
California." In a letter to Captain Montgomery, of the U. S.
ship Portsmouth, dated May 2, 1846, Mr. Larkin communicates
to that officer substantially the same information.
. These extracts from Mr. Larkin's corraspondence are important, no.t only as showing that the mine bad been discovered, and
was being worked in the spring of 1846, but that the mode of
-acquring a mine, as "inderstood by -Larkin, was .prmcisely -thq&

alleged to have been adopted in this case. And further, that
"the officer," the "Padre," and "the native of New York,"
spoken of as working the mine, were undoubtedly Castillero,
Padre Real, and William G. Chard, as will hereafter appear.
The whole official dispatch of Mr. Larkin to the Secretary of
State, is produced by the son of the former, from the letter-book
of his father. The portions extracted and certified to by Mr
Cass are all that is important to notice.
That the mine was worked by Castillero in January, 1846, is
shown by the deposition of Col. Fremont.
That gentleman states, that in January, 1846, he visited the
mine in company ith Capt. Hinckley; that the latter intro
duced him to Castillero, the owner of the mine, who showed him
the excavations, the heaps of ore, &c, and explained the process
of extracting the metal. Impressed with the value of the mine,
he spoke slightly to him about purchasing it; but Castillero
was not disposed to converse on the subject. Castillero informed him that he had acquired his mine by denouncement,
and explained the nature of the proceeding. Acting on this
information, Col. Fremont subsequently denounced the mines
upon his own property of Mariposa.
He also adds, that Capt. Leidesdorff, with whom he had
spoken as to the purchase of the mine, supposed it might be
effected for $30,000, "an immense sum of money in California
in those days."
The working of the mine, so far back as December, 1845, is
also proved by Mr. Win. G. Chard. This witness testifies that he
was employed by Castillero and the priest Don Jos6 Maria Real;
that he went there to open the mine in November or December,
1845; that the metal was extracted by heating the ore in gunbarrels; that while working in this way, the possession was given,
in December, 1845, or January, 1846. The witness enumerates
among those present on that occasion, the Alcalde Pico, Suaol,
Noriega, Fernandez, and the old man Berreyesa. He does not
recollect to have seen Castillero on the ground when possession
was given-a circumstance, as observed by counsel, not sur.
prising-for Castillero, Chard states, was constantly coming and

going, and on one visit stayed there eight days; but the state.
ment indicates the good faith of the witness in declining to swear
to what he did not recollect.
Mr. Chard describes the operations at the mine. They were
conducted by himsel, another white man, a blacksmith whom
they called Old Billy, and some Indians. He built a furnace
and smelted the ore in some large whaler's try-pots, capable of
holding three or four tons of ore. He remained in this employment until August or September, 1846.
Chard states himself to be a native of Columbia county, New
York. He is evidently the "native of New York" to whom
Mr. Larkin refers in his dispatch. His testimony is uncontradicted, and his character unimpeached.
There is much other testimony which corroborates the foregoing on various points, but which it is unnecessary to notioe.
It relates chiefly to the first visit of Castillero to the mine; his
first experiments with the ore; his trip to Sutter's Fort and visit
to Vallejo, at the baptism of whose child he was godfather, ard
whb thus became his compadre, by which title he addressed him
in his letters already cited; his return to Santa Clara, and the
formation of the partnership, between himself, Castro, Father
Real and the two Robles, in November, 1845. As this writing
of partnership is conceded to be genuine, and as it -relates to
the working of the mine of silver, gold, and quicksilver, on the
land of Jos6 Reyes Berreyesa, the fact that the mine was discovered at that time must be taken to be admitted.
We thus find that early in December, 1845, the discovery and
denouncement of the mine was made known to the Governor of
California, and the information, with a sample of the quicksilver
produced, by him transmitted to Mexico. That in May, 1846,
Mr. Larkin officially communicated the fact of the discovery
and the working of the mine, with an explanation of the mode
of acquiring title to it under Mexican laws, to our Government.
That in 3ne of the same year, he informed Mr. Judd of the
diseovery of the mine in i845, and the fact that it had been immediately denounced.

That in January, 1846, Col. Fremont visited the wcrks and

conversed with the "owner;" that its reputed value was then
about $30,000.
That it had been worked from the November or December
preceding by a person employed by Castillero, and continued to
be worked by the same person, until August or September,
1846.
It has appeared to me incredible that Castillero, a Mexican,
acquainted with mining laws, should, on discovering so valuable a mine, have omitted to d%nounce it. That he knew the
necessity of the proceeding, we learn from Fremont, as did also
Larkin, a foreigner, as is shown by his dispatch.
To suppose that Castillero, with a- knowledge of the great
value of the mine, of the necessity and efficacy of a denouncement, neglected, notwithstanding his statements to the Governor,
to take the simple proceedings he is alleged to have done, and
that Larkin was entirely mistaken as to the fact of his having
done so, is to suppose what I cannot but consider a moral im.
possibility.
I am aware that the fact that the mine was denounced by
Castillero, and claimed and worked by him as owner, does not
necessarily show that a juridical possession of it was given, or
that the record of that possession is genuine. It is shown, however, by evidence in part introduced by the United States, that
the juridical possession, as alleged to have been given, was
recognized and alluded to in the correspondence of the parties,
and in official acts of Alcaldes, before the date at which, on the
hypothesis of the United States, the forgery was committed.
So early as January 30th, 1846, James Alexander Forbes, in
a letter to Eustace Barron, of Tepic, apprises the latter that "D.
Andres Castillero, a sort of Commissioner from the Mexican
Government, is now working a quicksilver mine near the Mission of Santa Clara, which has yielded forty per cent. upon the
assay of mineral employed ;" and on the 5th of May, 1847, the
same person, who had in the interval been placed in charge of the
mine, in a letter to Alexander Forbes, -who had become a part
owner, urges him "to obtain from the Government of Mexico
the unqualified ratification of the judicial possession which ua

The; United States vs. Andres Castillero.
given of the miw by the local authority of this jurisdiction,inmud
ing, if -Possible,the three thousand varas of land given in that po8session as a gratificationto the discoverer." The fraudulent nature
of this suggestion is obvious, but it nevertheless implies that a
juridical possession and a gratification of three thousand varas
had already been given, a ratification of which was thought
necessary.
In thgppreceding March, the same person, together witl Castillero, Castro, Real, and the Robles, had been sued by the owner
of an adjoining raneho for working on it contrary to law. It
would seem from the imperfect record of that suit, produced
from the archives of the Alcalde's- office, that a survey of the
mine was ordered and the plaintiffs mulcted in cos.ts; a result
which could hardly have occurred if the persons working the
mine on the lands of another had been destitute of record evidence of their rights. The fact that a survey of the mine was
ordered, would seem to be a recognition of' the mine owner's
right to his mine, and that the bounidaries of his possession were
capable of being ascertained.
On the 14th of August, 1847, allusion to this suit, and a still
more explicit reference to the juridical possession, is made in an
official letter of James Alexander Forbes, then H. B. M. Vice.
Consul for California, to John Burton, Alcalde.
In this letter Mr. Forbes informs the Alcalde that "two persons have coinamenced digging a pit, by the direction of Mr.
Cook (the plaintiff in the former suit), within the limits of the
juridicalpossession of the mine." He adds, "Permit -me to refer
you to the documents which exist in your office, upon which wasfounded your conviction of the justice of your decision in March
last in relation to the claim of Mr. Cook, and to request that you
will be pleased to adopt such measures for the protection of the
owners of the mine, and of those who are legally interested. in
the same, as you miy deem most.conducive to that end."
The genuineness of this letter is not disputed. It will be
observed that, though written in August, 1847, it refers the
Alcalde to documents existing in his office upon which a deoi.
sion rendered in the March preceding was based.

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres (astillero.
On the 19th 'of January, 1848, Alexander Forbes, who had
come to California, made a petition to the Alcalde, Weekes, to
"visit and inspect the mine, as required by the Ordinances, and
to determine the direction and inclination of the vein, for the
purpose of reforming and correcting (since there is occasion for
it) the boundaries of the former Act of Possession, and to correct
such other mistakes as may appear in it."
In conformity with this petition, the Alcalde proceeded to
inspect the works; and having ascertained the true course of the
vein, and admitted the right of the owner to an improvement of
stakes (mejora de estacas), he established his boundaries, assign
ing to him four pertenencias,the location of which he designates
but without prejudice to the right and title of the mine (siendo
constante el derecho y titulo de la mina) to the gratification or
gift (gracia) of land conceded in the original Act of Possession.
Whether the four pertenencias which were thus designate3
were all which, under the ordinances, a discoverer, though wor]n •
ing in company, was entitled to, we will hereafter consider. The
only purpose for.which the proceeding is now referred to, is I.,
show that its date (January, 1848) and about the supposed time
of the alleged forgery, "an original Act of Possession," contain.
ing a "gracia" of land of a much larger extent, is plainly alluded
to as existing; nor is the force of'this fact weakened by the
circumstance that Weekes, the Alcalde, may have been ignorant,
and willing to comply with all that Alexander Forbes required;
for the fact that the latter inserted such an allusion in the document he may.have caused Weekes to execute, is at least evidence
that at that early day he claimed that there was in existence an
original Act of Possession, including a gracia of an extensive
tract. It will be observed that the petition of Alexander Forbes
to Weekes is dated January 19th, 1848. Its object was to pro.
cure the judicial ascertainment of the inclination and depth of
the vein, to correct the boundaries of the former Act of Possession, and to decide upon an increase of pertenencias and the
square corresponding to them. But if. at that very time, Forbes
had already fabricated, or was about to fabricate, an Act of Pos.
session, which was to be ante-dated and placed in *e archives

where no dxament of the kind had hitherto existed, the "appli.
cation to Wzekes, and the designation of pertenencias by hfih,
would be wholly superfluous, if not absurd; for in the forged
paper which was to serve as the original Act -of Possession by
the Mexican authorities, the designation of pertenenoias might
have been inserted and the boundaries established in any way
the forger might desire. All objections or doubts as to the
authority of an American Alcalde to act under Mexican Mining
Ordinances would thus have been avoided; and the same Alcalde
who, according to the theory of the United States, was induced
to -recognize and affirm the existence of an Act of Possession,
either not in his office or recently forged and placed there, could,
with equal facility, have been brought to reeogne an Act of
Possession which should be free from the errors nd uncertainties which he was called on to correct, and which bhould contain
us many pertenencias as he was desired to designate.
Similar allusions to the original registry and Act of Possession are found in various judicial proceedings during the year
L99. On the 18th October of that year, Robert Walkinshaw,
I: tween whom and James Alexander Forbes a contest f6r the
possession of the mine had arisen, filed a complaint against the
latter, averring himself to be "the owner of one-eighth of the
mine, by title derived under the originalact of registry.".

Previously.to the filing of this complaint, Mr. Horace Hawes,
a lawyer of much acuteness, and very familiar with Mexican law,
had denounced the.mine before the Alcalde for abandonment.
In this denouncement he describes it "as known in its original
title of registry as the Mine of Santa Clara."
In the proclamation issued thereupon, on the 23d October,
1849, the Alcalde describes the mine "as known and designated
in its original act of registry as that of Santa Clara, and now
known by the name of New Almaden." On the refusal of the
Alcalde to take jurisdiction of the proceeding, Mr. Hawes files
a protest, dated 15th November, setting forth that, "besides
having failed to work the mine, the alleged owners had never
a lquired any title thereto, by reason of the insufficient registry

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. AndreCastillero.
thereof, which he stands ready to prove in Court by witnesses
records and documents," &c.
As Walkinshaw, though he had originally obtained possession
of the mine as the agent of Castillero and his assigns, was in
these proceedings endeavoring to acquire the mine for himself,
and co-operating with and assisted by his attorney, Mr. Hawe.,
these references to the original act or title of registry conclusively show that such a document was on all sides admitted to
exist, though Mr. Hawes maintained it to be "in1sufficient ;" nor is
it conceivable that when Hawes and Walkinshaw, by possessory
suits, by denouncement for abandonment, by purchasing the
lands of adjoining rancheros, &c., were struggling with so great
pertinacity to obtain the mine for themselves, they should have
utterly failed to disclose the fact, of which Walkinshaw could
not have been ignorant, that no registry had ever been made,
and that the document purporting to be the act of possession
was a recent forgery, then lately interpolated among the
archives.
In the correspondence between James Alexander Forbes and
Alexander Forbes, and the other, owners of the mine, the necessity of procuring fraudulent and ante'dated title papers from
Mexico, is repeated and urgently represented. But the fraud
recommended is the fabrication of an absolute grant of two sitios
of land, and a ratification of "the acts done by the Alcalde in
the possession given by him of the quicksilver mine in his
jurisdiction."
Such are the very terms of the memorandum of "documents to
be procured by Castillero," allegec by James Alexander Forbes
to have been left by him in Tepic, in May, 1849. And in
October of the safae year, chagrined, it would seem, that his
suggestions hadnot yet been acted on, he complains that he is
obliged to depend on "the precarious and illegal possession of
the mine granted by the Alcalde of this District to Castillero,
who was in reality the judge of the quantity of land given by the
Alcalde."
Whether the, doubts here expressed as to the legality of the
possession be well or ill-founded, it. is clear that in this most

confidential communication, where n6 fhotive existed for suppressing or distorting the facts of the case, that possession is
treated as having actually been given, and the record of it as
actually existing and genuine, though the possession itselt is
considered precarious And illegal.
Having thus reviewed the evidence which establishes the
genuineness of the act of possession by the testimony of the
witnesses to the document; of those who were present when the
possession was given, and who testify to the fact; by the pro.
duction of documents from the Archives of Calif6rnia, and the
correspondence, both privatd and official, of the United States
Consul at Monterey; by the .testimony of uimpeached witnesses
that the mine was, early in 1846, claimed by and recognized ad
belonging to Castillero, and worked by him as such; by the
proofs afforded, by a correspondent admitted to be genuine, that
the act of possession was treated and spoken of by the parties,
when writing in the most confidential manner, at a time when
they could not have been ignorant of the facts, as genuine,
though perhaps invalid, and was so recognized in various judicial proceedings by persons who would certainly have discovered
and denounced any forgery which might have been committed;
and finally, the intrinsic improbability of the supposition that
Castillero would have omitted to denounce a mine, of the great
value of which he was fully aware, and the means of acquiring
a title to which, under the Mining Ordinances, he was well
acquainted with, as was also Mr. Larkin, a resident foreigner.
I shall next consider more particularly the nature and contents of the documents produced by the claimants, as well as the
principal objections to them urged by the counsel for the United
States.
These documents are four in number. The first is the original
espediente, produced from the Archives of the City of San Jos,
and discovered by Capt. Halleck, in 1851, among the Archives
ol the old .lcalde's office, in the office of Belden, the Mayor of
San Jos6.
This document contains the two representations of Castillerm

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs Andres Castillero.
and the act of possession with the original signatures of Castil.
lero, the Alcalde, and the assisting witnesses.
It also contains a petition of Jos6 Castro, dated June 27, 1846.
In this petition, Castro states that he represents the person and
rights of Capt. D. Andres Castillero, and other individuals composing the company in the quicksilver mine which Setor Castillero denounced on the 3d day of December, 1845, and of which
possession was given on the 30th of the same month and year.
He therefore claims that, in conformity with the Mining Laws,
there be given three pertenencias in continuation of the first;
and that this petition be attached to the espediente of denounce.
ment, and remain among the Archives. On the margin of this
petition is an order, signed "Pacheco," directing it to be archived
as prayed for.
If this document be genuine, it affords important evidence of
the date of the judicial possession.
The handwriting of the petition is sworn by Fernandez to be
that of Benito Diaz. The signature of Castro is proved by himself,and he testifies that it was signed at its date, having been
prepared from a draft left with him by Castillero. He also states
that the handwriting of the marginal order is that of Salvio
Pacheco, and the signature that of Dolores Pacheco; and that
after sending the petition to the Alcalde he left Santa Clara, but
was informed, on his return, by the Alcalde, in presence of
Manuel Castro and Juan B. Alvarado, that this petition had
been granted.
Salvio Pacheco is also produced, and testifies to his own handwriting aid the signature of his brother, the Alcalde. He swears
that the order was written at its date. As this witness has been
produced by the United States to sustain the character of a
witness impeached by the claimants, it is presumed that his
own character is not liable to the imputations from which the
United States rely on him to shield another.
The only evidence tending to show that the petition was not
written at its date is that of Benito Diaz. He does not precisely
specify the time at which it was written; but it can be gathered

DECEMBER TERM,1862.

265

The UniTd States vs. Andres (astillero.
from his testimony that it was at the end of 1847, or the beginning of 1848.
But this witness is, unfortunately, too well known to the
Court to permit any reliance to be placed upon his unsupportea
declarations. I have not been able exactly to understand on.
what theory this petition is supposed to be forged.
If the act of possession be genuine, it is immaterial, so far as
the rights of the parties are concerned, whether the petition be
ante-dated or not; but it is not easy to imagine the motive of
the parties in.fabricating a petition addressed to an Alcalde who
had ceased to be in office, and whose ante-dated marginal order
did not even purport to convey any rights. Had the marginal
order contained a grant of an increased number of pertenencias,
some motive for fabricating it would have existed; but it merely
directs the petition to be archived; and the application for an
increase of pertenencias is in substance renewed in the patition
of Alexander Forbes to Weekes, made in 1848, at the -very time
when we are asked to suppose this petition of Castro was
fabricated. If the act of possession be genuine, and the Castro
petition be ante-dated, the conduct of the parties seems to me
inconsistent, absurd, and inexplicable. But if the act of possession was itself fabricated in 1848, and did not exist at the date
when the Castro petition was fabricated, the acts of the parties
are equally incomprehensible. Of what use could it be to have
a petition for an increase of pertenencias included among
archives which *contained no registry or denouncement, or grant
of any pertenencias whatever? It may be said that the fabrication of the act was then in contemplation; but if so, why not
make that document contain all that was desired as to the
number of pertenencias, designation of boundaries, &c? Why
accumulate super~fuous forgeries, involving the necessity of-new
peijuries, and largely increasing the risks. of detection; and why
resort to the proceedings had before Weekes for the ascertain.
ment of boundaries and an increase of pertenencias, when it was
known that the fundamental title to the mine had yet to be
forged, and might be framed in any way to suit the interests of
the parties?

SUPREME COURT.
The United $tates vs. Andres Castillero,
The counsel for the United States has urged upon the Court
the inconsistency between the petition of Castro for three addi.
tional pertenencias and the. supposition that a concession of
three thousand varas in all directions, amounting to nine hundred pertenencias, had already been obtained. But this objection, whatever be its force, seems to admit the genuineness of
the Castro petition; or, it attributes to the fabricators the
absurdity of contriving at the same time two forged documents
repugnant to each other. That an act of possession, either
genuine or forged, was in existence when Castro's petition was
drawn, is evident, for the dates of the denouncement and of the
judicial possession are given. To what end then, file a petition
which could have no other purpose than to furnish a plausible
argument against the genuineness of the previous concession of
three thousand varas?
From all the evidence, and on consideration of all the circumstances connected with this petition, I confess myself unable to
discover any sufficient reasons for considering it forged.
The claimants have also produced a document alleged by
them to. have been delivered to Castillero shortly after the date
of the judicial possession.
It contains certified copies of the two representations of Castillero, purporting to have been made on the 13th January,
1846, and a duplicate original of the act of possession signed by
Antonio Maria Pico. Appended to these is a receipt by Pico
for twenty-five dollars, dated December 30, 1846.
This document was recently found among the papers of
Robert Walkinshaw, deceased. It is shown in the deposition
of Hall McAllister, Esq., who was counsel for Walkinshaw in a
suit respecting a share of the mine, that the document was
placed in his possession by Mr. Walkinshaw early in the year
1853, and that it remained in his office until May, 1858, when
te delivered it to Walkinshaw.
The genuineness of the signatures is testified to by all the
assisting and subscribing witnesses, except Jos6 Sufiol, who is
dead.

the certified c6pies appear to have been made on the 18th January, while the Castro petition was not filed until the June
following. There is one circumstance, however, which, though
entirely accidental, affords important proof of its genuineness.
In copying the first representation of Castillero, it appears that
a line was omitted. This has been supplied by another hand,
and the handwriting is that of Castillero. As Castillero left
California early in 1846, and has never returned, we must suppose that this interlineation was made before he left7 or else that
the document was fabricated here at a later period, sent on to
Castillero in Mexico, interlined by him, and returned to Walkinshaw's possession before January, 1853, when he delivered it
amongst other papers to Mr. McAllister. But that he was in
possession of "some important papers of the original registry of
the mine," in 1849, appears from James Alexander Forbes' letter
of October 28, of that year; and it also appears from the certified
copy made out by Weekes on the 20th January, 1848, that the
espediente we are now considering must have been the docu.
ment which James Alexander Forbes copied, and which Weekes
erroneously certified to be a literal copy of the original -in his
office. The year in which it is supposed by the Government
that these titles were7 fabricated, in 1848. How, then, could this

on the 20th January, 1848? And why, if the Castro petition:
had then recently been written by Benito Diaz, and ante-dated,
was it not included in this espedient, concerning which so much
pains were taken?
The omission of the Castro p5tition in this espediente seems
to me, I confess, an important corroboration of the statements
of the witnesses who prove the genuineness of the signatures.

diente, cerdified by-Pedro Chabolla, on the 13th August, 1846,
to be a literal copy of the original acts (autos) in the archives
of his offlce.
The whole of this copy is proved by Salvio Pacheco, to be in
his own handwriting, and to have been made at its date. It
contains the Castro petition, which had been made in the preceding June, and attached to the original on file, and it even
omits, like the original, the date of the act of possession-that
date being oft both papers December - 1845, and not December 30th, as in the testimonio or duplicate original given to Castillero. That the document was scrupulously compared is further evident from the fact that in the copy of the date of Castillero's first representation is the Mission de Santa Clara, November
22, de 845, instead of 1845-and on turning to the original, we
find in the printed .copy that the first figure of the date is separated by a comma from the three other figures. I have not had
an opportunity to examine the original, which remains at San
Jos6; but it would seem from the printed Transcript that the
date is written in an unusual manner, which has been either
exactly reproduced or has led to the omission of the first figure
in the copy.
It has been earnestly contended by the counsel for the United
States, that the non-existence of the original espediente in the
archives of San Jos6, even so late as December 23d, 1850, is
proved by the affidavit of Mr. Halleck, at that titne, and since,
Superintendent of the Mine, and counsel for James Alexander
Forbea in a suit brought against him and Walkinshaw by the
Berreyesa. In this affidavit, which was made in answer to an
order obtained by the plaintiffs, in the suit upon the defendants,
requiring them toi produce the papers on which they intended to
rely as a defence, or copies thereof, Mr. Halleck swears:
."That the defendants have exercised all due diligence to procure and produce said papers in Court, by writing immediately
on the receipt of the above-mentioned order to the parties in
Afexico who hold them. But to this date the defendants have not
#eceived them. * * * And the defendants specify among

sary to them before they can proceed with the trial of this
cause, viz.:
"1st. The oriqinal denouncement of the mine of New Almadn,
and the juridicalpossession given of the same year 1845.

"2d. The confirmation of said denouncement and possession
by the Supreme Government in 1846, and prior to the late declaration of war by the United States against Mexico.
"3. The original grant of land, including said mining posses.
sion, made by the Supreme Government of Mexico, prior to the
declaration of war as aforesaid, to the owners of said mine."
It is obvious that. this affidavit states that the original
denouncement and judicial possession of the mine was then in
Mexico, and not in the Alcalde's office. That Mr. Halleck, then
lately appointed Superintendent of the Mine, might have been
ignorant of the fact that those papers were among the archiv, s
of the Alcalde's office, is conceivable; and he may also hai e
accepted the assurances of his client, James Alexander Forbes,
that he had exercised all due diligence to procure them, as suffilcient to authorize his affidavit of that fact; but it cannot be
supposed that James Alexander Forbes could have labored
under a similar misapprehension. We have already seen that
in August, 1847, he had, in an official letter to Alcalde Burton,
referred him to the documents existing in his office, uponwhich
was founded his conviction of the justice of his decision in rela
tion to the claim of Mr. Cook, in the pfeceding March.
In January, 1848, he had himself copied and procured Weekes
to certify to the espediente containing certified copies of Castillero's representations and a duplicate original of the act of possession. This espediente has since been produced from among
Walkinshaw's papers, and its possession by him, or his counsel,
is traced back as far as 1853. The circumstance that it is interlined in the handwriting of Castillero, proves it to have been at
some time in his possession. • As Castillero left California early
in 18416, it is in a high degree improbable that the dc ament
could have been fabricated here, sent on to him in 'Mexico, and
returned before January, 1848, when it was copied by Forbes
and certified; nor does such a hypothesis comport with the

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
theory of the United States, which supposes the forgeries to
have been committed about the time of the Weekes certificates.
It is almost equally improbable that this document, after being
copied by Weekes, should have been again sent to Mexico, and
returned to Walkinushaw in time to be found among his papers in
1853.
There is no reason to presume that the Weekes copy ever left
this State. It was produced by the claimants when proceedings
were first instituted before the Board of Commissioners, in 1852.
It is clear, therefore, that as the order of the Court called for
the documents on which the defendants relied, or copies thereof
it Was easy for Mr. Forbes to have satisfied the order by furnish
ing the copy required.
It also appears from his own letters that he had already
received a notarial copy of the Lanzas dispatch on which they
rely. A copy of this could also have been furnished. We are
thus compelled to seek for some other motive for withhholding
those copies which the order required, and which, on any theory
of the case, he could readily have furnished. That motive seems
to me apparent. From the 5th of May, 1847, up to the 26th of
February, 1850, James Alexander Forbes had not ceased to urge
upon his associates the necessity of obtaining fabricated documents of title. In his letter of February 26th, 1850, he again
dwells upon the necessity of carrying his suggestions intojeffect,
and specifies the required documents as follows:
"1. A full and complete ratification of all the acts of the
Alcalde of this jurisdiction, in the possession of the mine.
"2. A full and unconditional grant to Castillero of two sitios
of land, covering that mining possession, expressing the boun.
daries stated by me in the memorandum I left with you at Tepic.
Both of these documents to be of the proper date and placed in the
proper Governmental custody in ffexico."
On the 7th of April, 1850, Alexander Forbes, of Tepic, writes
to James Alexander Forbes: "Mr. Barron and Castillero have
arrived in Me:,;eo, and have every prospect of finding the document you are aware of, and which will, of course, be forwarded
as soon as possible"

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

271

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

When, therefore, in December 1850, James Alexander Forbes
represented to Mr. Halleck, that papers had been sent for, and
were daily expected from Mexico, it cannot be doubted that he
referred to the documents, the fabrication of:which he had so
urgently recommended. The description of the expected documents in the affidavit, in no respect applies to the Lanzas
dispatch; for the ratification, and the grant of two sitios, are
evidently described as two separate instruments, and they are
spoken of as "of the proper date," viz.: "prior to the late declhration of war by the United States against Mexico ;" that is, prior
to the 13th of May, 1846; whereas the Lanzas dispatch is dated
on the 23d of May.
We have already shown that James Alexander Forbes could
readily have complied with the order of the Court by furnishing
"copies" of the denouncement and registry, and of the Lanzas
dispatch, both of which he must have then had in his possession.
The statements, therefore, which he made to his counsel, and on
which the affidavit was founded, were evidently made for delay,
and to enable him to' receive the more full and explicit documents he so much desired. Such being the motive and intent
of Mr. Forbes, the allegation that "the original denouncement
of the mine was in Mexico," may well be taken as made in furtherance of the same object, and to give increased force to his
showing, for the postponement which he was so anxious to
obtain.
That Mr. Halleck should have embodied in an affidavit these
representations of Forbes will, perhaps, not be surprising to any
one acquainted with the facility, often too great, with which
counsel receive and adopt in affidavits statements made by their
clients in the progress of a cause. Such has seemed to me the
more probable explanation of this affidavit. For, whatever may
have been therein sworn to, I can see no reason for concluding,
on the strcngth of that affidavit alone, and in the face of the
mass of testimony which had been adduced to the contrary, that
the espediente of the mining possession was not then in the
Alca de's office.
Tt was also strongly urged by the counsel of the Unied

SUPREME COURT
The United States vs. Andres (astillero.
States, on the hearing, that the non-existence of the alleged act
of possession and concession of three thousand varas was proved
by the acts of the parties themselves and their dealings with
each other.
The circumstances chiefly relied on were1. The fact that in the Castro petition, drafted by Castillero,
three pertenencias are asked for, in continuation of -the one
already obtained.
2. That in the power of attorney executed by Castro, on the
12th June, 1846, to McNamara; in the contract by McNamara,
under the power of attorney, executed in Tepic on the 28th
November, 1846; and in the ratification of that instrument bv
Castillero in Mexico, on the 17th December, 1846, the mine is
spoken of as consisting of only three pertenencias, while the
grant of th ree thousand yars is not mentioned.
3. That in the numerous deeds and acts of sale by which
barras or shares in the mine were transferred, the writing of
partnership executed by the original owners of the mine is the
only document referred to, no allusion is made to the possession
of three thousand varas, or to any tract of land whatsoever; and
the Espediente of Registration is, for the first time, mentioned in
the deed from Padre Real to Walkinshaw, dated August 9th,
1849.
These objections, so far as they relate to the mention, of the
pertenencias, will more conveniently be considered in treating
of the legal effect of the judicial possession; but in respect to
omission of all allusion in the deeds, either to the registration or
to "lands," it is to be observed that to many of these deeds,
James Alexander Forbes was a party. We find by his letter
of May 5th, 1847, that at that date the "ratification" of three
thousand varas of land given by the Alcalde, and the concession
of two sitios of land to Castillero, were known to and spoken
of by him as having actually hleen made, the object of that letter
being to urge the necessity of obtaining an unqualified ratifica
tion of the mining possession, and a positive, formal and unconditional grant of the two sitios. Similar references to the acd
of possession, and the order of Castillo Lanzas, occur thtough.

out his correspondence. And as we have already seen, the
former document and the fact of registration is referred to in
m ious legal proceedings by Forbes and Walkinshaw in the
years 1847-8 ; as also in Alexander Forbes! petition to Weekes,
in January, 1848.
The inferences, therefore, which might otherwise be drawn
from the silence of the deeds on this point, seem to be repelled
by the fact that, in letters and various judicial proceedings, the
registration, the grant of three thousand varas, and the conces
sion of two leagues, are frecfuently spoken of and claimed to
ha'ie been made.
It will be noticed that in the first representation of Castillero,
dated November 22, 1845, the mine is described as a vein of
silver with a ley of gold; and, by his second representation, it
appeafs that he subsequently, and at some time previous to
December 3d, discovered it to contain quicksilver. The writioZ
of partnership, however, dated November 2d, describes a silver
mine with a ley of gold and quicksilver, showing that twenty
days previous to his first denouncement he must have beea
aware of the existence of quicksilver in the vein. This di
crepancy is forcibly urged by thecounsel of the United State 6,
as affording conclusive proof that the alleged denouncemen.s
ate forgeries.
It seems, from the evidence produced by the claimants, thai in
the month of October, 1845, Castillero and Castro set out from
fonterey, to visit General Vallejo, at Sonoma, and General
Sutter, at Sutters Fort. On their way, Castillero, at the suggestion of Castro, examined the spot which, as the latter told him,
'had for a long period been reported to be a mine, but of what
kind was unknown. He assayed the ore, and found a little gold
and silver, and a small quantity of quicksilver. The latter he
co i dered of no importance.
The party proceeded to Sonoma, and thence to Sutter's Fort,
and ,set out on their'return on the 12th November. On reaching 'Santa Clara, Castillero made further assays of The mineral.
"He then disco 'ered," says Castro, "abundance of quicksilver,
denounced the mine as a quicksilver mine, and formed a comVOL.oI

18

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Caslillero

pany to work it." But this statement is evidently erroneous, for
the writing of partnership is dated November 2d, and, if exe
cuted at its date, must have been. made when the parties were
on their way to Sonoma and Sutter's Fort, and not on their return
from the latter. But if Castillero, at the latter date, had discovered quicksilver in large quantities, how can we -account foi
his first representation, which omits all mention of that metal,
nor for his second representation which announces the discovery
of it, as having been made after the date of his first representation, i. e. after November 22d.
It is quite probable, however, that Castro may be in error, if
he means to state that Castillero discovered the abundance of
quicksilver and denounced the mine as a quicksilver mine immediately on his return to Santa Clara, Castro himself went on,
as he states, to Monterey. The party, having left Sutter's Fort
on the 12th November, must have reached Santa Clara between
the 16th and 20th. It may well be said, therefore, that Castillero
made his first representation immediately on his arrival, and
subsequently made the further assays spoken of by Castro, in
consequence of which he orepared his second or amended
denouncement.
On this hypothesis we can account for his
omission to mention the existence of quicksilver in his first
denouncement, as he did not then know that it existed in sufficient quantities to deserve attention. But whatever explanation of this discrepancy be offered or conjectured, I have been
unable to perceive how it furnishes the conclusive evidence of
the fraudulent character of the denouncement, which the counsel
for the United States supposes it to afford.
If these papers were forged about the year 1848, they must
have been forged at a time when the character and great value
of the mine were well understood. What motive, then, can be
suggested for fabricating two representations, in one of which
6ne existence of quicksilver in the vein was entirely ignored?
Impressed, as the parties must then have been, with the great
value of the mine, as a mine of quicksilver, can it be supposed
that, merely to give the appearance of truth to the document,;

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

they were fabricating, they caused them to express a pretended
ignorance of the nature of the vein?
Even if so refined and subtle a cunning could be attributed to
them, the same cuning would not have suffered them to overlook the fact that the writing of partnership existed, which fixed
upon them the knowledge of the existence of quicksilver in the
vein twenty days before the date of the first denouncement.
j confess that, though unable to demonstrate how his discrepancy has occurred, I perceive in it rather what the ingenious
counsel for the United States has on another occasion characterized as the "deshabille of truth," than that meretricious
ostentation of consistency, which falsehood would not have
neglected to display.
But the circumstance that I have found most dii.cult to
account for, and which most strongly suggests suspicions as to
the genuineness of the Act of Possession, is the failure of Castillero to exhibit, or even mention, it during his protracted negotiation with M. Negrete. The correspondence of the latter with
his principal, Alexander Forbes, shows that Castillero was called
on to exhibit his title-papers. He responded by producing the
writing of partnership and, after a little delay, the Lanzas dis.
patch. He .not only does not exhibit the "copia autorizada,"
which, if genuine, he must have received before his departure
from California, but he does not even mention that he has b6en
put in possession and received a concession from the Alcalde of
a tract of three thousand varas in extent, nor that any such possession had been. ratified by the Supreme Government. So far
as appears from the instrument executed at that time, and the
testimony of Mr. Negrete, the writing of partnership was the
only document of title to the mine relied on, and an interest in
the two leagues grant during the term of the lease is added as a
kind of voluntary cession to the Aviadores.. In all the deeds
which passed between the parties for several- years, no allusion
whatsoever to the Act of Possession occurs, but the writing of
partnership and a mine of three pertenencias are alone spoken of
That the parties were ignorant of the precise number of per
tenencias allowed by the law is not improbable, and that tlie)

ishouldhave treated the mine as consisting of thenumber of pertenencias assignable to a discoverer, can be -reconciled with the
facts as they are claimed to have existed. But the omission of
Castillero to exhibit the Act of Possession, which constituted
his only title-paper for the mine, and the only evidence of his
denouncement and registry, and which alone showed that the
persons, or any of them mentioned in the writing of partnership,
had any rights whatever in the subject-matter of their contract,
is a circumstance which I have found it impossible to account
for.
Even on the hypothesis that he had neglected to bring with
him, through accident or otherwise, a copy of the Act of Possession, it would still seem almost inevitable that he should have
given to Mr. INegrete some information of the existence of such
a paper, and at least mentioned the Alcalde's concession of three
thousand varas. No explanation of this circumstance is offerc1
by the claimants. I have been much impressed with its signif.cance. It might well seem to justify the inference, not that the
mine was not discovered and worked as alleged, or that it wv s
n2t in some manner denounced, or that the Alcalde did not give
a possession, as sworn to by the witnesses-for of these fact
there can, I think, be no doubt- -but that the record of the Act
of Possession has been since fabricated and antedated.
But when we consider the vast number of perjuries and complicated forgeries which such a supposition involves, and the
grave and almost insuperable objections which present themselves to any theory of forgery, no matter what date be assigned
for its commission, and especially if we accept the date fixed by
the counsel for the United States, (viz., subsequent to February
2, 1848,) it seems impossible, under the proofs, to adopt the
hypothesis of the United States.
Our daily experience apprises us that events are constantly
occurring which would, a priori,be pronounced in the highest
degree improbable. That which is true does not always present
the appearance of truth, and it is not usually safe to discredit
qsitive testimony to a fact on an estimate of what would be
Hibly to have happened.

Bat in this case, if,
reasoning on the extreme improbability
that Castillero would have failed to produce to Mr. Negrcte- the
Act of Possession, if it existed, we adopt the conclusion that it
did not then exist, we encounter improbabilities greater than
those we are seeking.to avoid.
For-admitting, as we must admit, that he discovered the mine;
that its great value, estimated by Col. Fremont at $30,000, was
known to him; that he denounced it in some form, as is stated
by Mr. Larkin to Mr. Judd, and to his own Government by
himself, and by Castro to the Governor of California, as-was
notorious throughout the country-it i% as before observed,
ahrost incredible that he should not have made the denounce.
ment in writing, and substantially as is now claimed. If the
papers were fabricated after February, 1848, how can we account
fbr the copy certified to by Weekes in January of that year, and
which must then have contained the interlineation in Castillero's
handwriting, who was absent in Mexico?
How can we account for the useless forgery of the Castro
petition, which the counsel for the United States allege to have
been made by Diaz in 184:7, and which speaks of the denouncement and act of possession, which had not yet been fabricated ?
Why, if the parties were then preparing their spurious documents did they, at the same time, ask for additional perteneir
'cias, when the documents they were forging could be made- to
express all that they desired?
How shall we explain the absence, throughout James' Abeander Forbes' voluminous correspondence, of any reproacli; or
even regret, that the forgery had been so clumsily effeeted as'to
leave the Act of Possession "precarious and illegal;" how
account for the allusions to the documents of registry irjudicial
proceedings, official letters of Forbes to the Alcalde, and the
entire absence of any accusation or hint of forgery, wilen

us that the theory of forgery is beset with greater difficulties
than the supposition that Castillero, for some unexplained
reason, omitted to produce or allude to the Act of Possession,
which, nevertheless, existed.
Assuming, then, the genuineness of the Act of Possession; 1
proceed to inquire what this document and the proofs show to
have actually been done-and what was its legal effect.
In the first place, it appears that the written statement
required by Art. 4, tit. vI., of the Ordinances, to be made by
the discoverer, was in fact presented by Castillero. The vein
was described as situated on the lands of Berreyesa, and the
discoverer declared that he wished to work it in company.
The names of his partners were not stated as enjoined by the
ordinances.
It does not appear that the corresponding entry, in a book
kept by the Alcalde, was made, nor was the "statement returned
to the dis'coverer for his " due security.
Whether notices were affixed, as required by the ordinances
is perhaps not clearly established, although some witnesses
testify to the fact.
It further appears, that within the ninety days limited by law
a pit had been dug, the mine opened and working commenced,
and that at the expiration of thirty-eight days from the date of
the denouncement, judicial possession of the mine was given.
-It is not pretended that any number of pertenencias were
measured to Castillero when possession was given, nor that he
was called to fix stakes in his boundaries, as directed by the
ordinance.
It has already been shown that, by the spirit and terms of the
ordinances, discovery was recognized as the true foundation of
title to a mine. That the registration was but a formal an
nouncement of the fact of discovery, and only required, in the
language of Gamboa, three things to be manifested--"the person,
the place, and the ore." That upon this declaration, the law
itself annexed the title, and the mine was said not to be granted,
but to be adjudicated,by the judicial tribunal which had juris.
diction in such matters. That from the moment of denouneo

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

The United Stas vs. Andres Castillero.

ment the discoverer had the legal right to commence working
his mine, and was required within ninety days to dig a pit of
certain dimensions under penalty of forfeiture of his right, but
that as soon as this was done he was entitled to receive judicial
possession of his mine; and this, notwithstanding that the period
allowed for others to show a better right, had not elapsed.
It was also shown that under the old ordinances no measurement of pertenencias was required to be made when possession
was given; though this was required by the Ordinances of 1783,
the penalty of forfeiture was not by those ordinances annexed
to the omission to do so, though such a provision had been
recommended by Gamboa. It was also shown that the requirement of the ordinances with regard to noting the contents of a
statement in a book, &c., was directory to the Alcalde, and that
his neglect of duty in that respect ought not to impair the
vested right of the discoverer any more than the omission to
record a colonization grant should effect the title of a bona fide
grantee of land. The duty of recording registries in a book to
be kept for the purpose was also imposed by ordinances prior
to the time of Gamboa; but that author, though he strongly
urges its policy and convenience, nowhere intimates that a
failure by the mining tribunals to comply with this requirement'of the law affected the title of the mine-owner-whose
rights were evidenced by the copy of the "diligencias" 'or proceedings which was delivered to him-which corresponded to
the "attested copy of the proceedings" which, by the Ordinances of 1783, was required "to be delivered to the party as
his corresponding title."
If these views be correct, it follows that all the provisions of
the ordinances indispensably necessary to vest the title in the
discoverer of a mine have in this instance been followed. And
Castillero, by his denouncement, the digging of a pit within
ninety days, and the judicial possessio- given, acquired by law
a right to his mine, with a number of pertenencias allowed to a
discoverer working in company.
But it appears, from the loose and informal document executed by the Alcalde, that in addition to the juridical possession

which he was empowered to give, that officer "concludW-- ta

to that which the General Mining Ordinance indicates."
It will be observed, that the Alcalde does not here pretend to
adjudicate the mine to the discoverer, nor to put him in possession of any designated number of pertenencias, but 't&grant
him a large tract of land about his mipp. It is unnecessary to
say that such a concession, evm o? O6lic land by an- Ai.calde
was wholly void, and as against either the Sovereign or apri.
vate owner, conveyed no rights whatever.
It is insisted by the counsel of. the United States, that this
distinction between the possession of the mine and the graeia, orgift, of three thousand varas, is due entirely to the ingenuity of.
counsel for claimants, and is not found in the words or sense-of,
the instrument.
*We have already seen that the same distinction is clearly
taken in James Alexander Forbes' letter of May 5th, 1847. We,
will hereafter see that it is alluded to in Castillero's communication to the Junta, in which he states "that he has taken possession not only of said mine, but also of an extent of three
thousand varas in all directions from that point."
The distinction is not, therefore, a recent suggestion of-in.
genious counsel.
That it is very clearly expressed in the very inartificial
document called the Act of Possession, is not pretended.
Taken literally, that document merely states that, "I the
Alcalde, have resolved to act, by virtue of my office, in-order-to
give juridical possession of a mine known by the name of Sant&Clara, and (after sundry recitals) have concluded to grant him
three thousand varas in all directions, subject- to what the
Mining Ordinance indicates."
Nor is it pretended that any possession of the mine as distinguished from the three thousand varas, was given. That
the Alcalde, the assisting witnesses and others, went to the mine,
for the purpose of giving a possession of some kind, is clear:
but he made no measurements, and fixed no stakes. He-proba-bly, told Castillero that he gave him possession of'the mine

•

and added that he- might, take three thousand varas in every

direction around it.
The explanations of this act given by Pico himself, are con,
fused and contradictory.
In his first deposition, taken on behalf of the claimants, Pico
says: "Castillero told me he required three thousand varas in all
directions, and I told him to take them. He told me he had that
right- by reason of his -being the first discoverer of the metal.
According to what Castillero told me, I believed that I, as
Alcalde, had authority to do that, there being no other Juez de
Letras. He was a man learned in all those subjects." He adds .
"I do not know whether it [the land of which he gave posses,
iion] was round or square, because I made the division in different directions, as I proposed to Castillero; that is to say, that
he should take it where it was vacant, or in the mountains,
because the rancheros would not have mountains-they wanted
plains only."
In a subsequent deposition, taken some three years afterwards
-- viz., in 1860-Pico admits that he had stated in - deposition
taken in another case, that he pointed out the boundaries which
Castillero was to take, but gave him no fixed possession; that
there was a question between Castillero and Berreyesa-Berreyesa would not consent that possession should be given to
Castillero unless he would admit that he (Barreyesa) should
have an interest in the mine. In consequence of this, I did not
give any fixed possession of the land.
In a subsequent part of the deposition of 1860, (Ans. 17,) Pico
says: "I intended to grant only what was intended by the ordinance around the mine, and the rest to be taken on public land."
"I never intended to grant another man's land." (Ans. 16.)
When reminded by the counsel for the .United States that. the
mine was at some distance from the nearest body of public land:
recognized as such at that time by himself, and asked how he
could have granted three thousand varas, to be measured in all
directions from the mouth of the mine, if he intended only to
grant public land, the witness replies: "It was because Berreyesa agreed with Castillero at the time, and told me I migbt

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
grant the land, provided I did not include the land needed for
cul tivation; and, therefore, I made the grant." And in Answer
24, he admits that three thousand varas in all directions would
include part of Berreyesa's land as well as public land.
Amidst these confused and contradictory statements it is, I
think, not difficult to perceive what was really done, or attempted
to be done, by the Alcalde. He was aware, and so informed Berreyesa, as he states, that "the ordinances authorized a certain
quantity of land around the mine to be granted, whether on
public or private land-that is, that to the discoverer and to
the one working in company, a certain number of pertenencias
were to be assigned. How many, neither he nor probably
Castillero knew. But in addition to these liertenencias, which
determined the extent of the mine, he also undertook to grant a
tract of three thousand varas to be taken on public, or on Berreyesa's land, if the latter consented. The transaction with
regard to this grant seems to justify the observation of James
Alexander Forbes, in his letter of October 30th, 1849, that the
possession- of the mine granted by the Alcalde to Castillero "was
precarious and illegal; the latter being in reality the judge of
the quantity of land given by the Alcalde."
The concession of the three thousand vara is by its terms
provisional, for it is declared to be "subject to what the general
Mining Ordinance indicates ;" nor does it purport to be a concession of the tract described, as of so many pertenencias of the
mine, but rather a grant of land as a gracia or gift.
The difference is important, for in the one case Castillero (ii
the grant were valid), would, under the Mexican laws, have been
the owner, not only of the large tract conceded to him, but of
all the mines which might be discovered within it; in the other,
he would merely have owned the mineral veins within the per
tenencias allowed by law, while all others within the three thou
sand vara tract would have remained liable to denouncement by
any one who might discover and be ready to work them.
Castillero himself seems to have understood that he was enti
tled to four pertenencias, for in the petition of Castro, which was
drafted by hims If, there is asked "three pertenencias in cor

tinuation of the firs." It is not, however, very clear that three
additional pertenencias are hiere asked for, or perhaps Castro
may'have misunderstood Castillero's instructions, for it appears
that in his ratification of McNamara's contract, made at Mexico,
December 17, 1846, Castillero describes the mine as of three pertenencias only. That such was understood to be the dimensions
of the mine by all parties, in 1846 and 1847, appears not only
from their acts of sale, but from the testimony of James Alexander Forbes.
This witness states, that "in 1846 he received from Padre
Real possegsion of the mine, the hacienda, about a mile distant
from it, the mining utensils and some ores. No definite extent
of land was specified. It was understood that the mine contained three pertenencias at that time, but the hacienda was not
understood to be within the three pertenencias." The possession
transferred by him to Walkinshaw in 1847, and again on his
return from Tepic received back from Walkinshaw, is stated to
have been like the original possession received from Padre
Real. It comprised the hacienda and the mine, but no definite
tract of land.
In a subsequent part of his examination he says: "There was
only one act of possession which I understood to have been
given. This embraced three pertenencias, so far as regarded the
mine. Thiree pertenencias, nd also lands about the hacienda, I
understood to. have been given to Castillero in 18452'
"These lands were understood to be of the extent of three
thousand varas," he adds; and in the deed received by him
from the Robles, and which conveys "all their rights and shares
in each one of the three pertenencias of the mine," their interest
in the lands and hacienda passed; for, "by Mexican custom, a
sale of barras in a mine includes an interest in the hacienda."
In the possession obtained by Alexander Forbes from Weekes,
Alcalde, in January, 1848, four pertenencias seem to have been
considered the number to which the parties were entitled, and a
tract two hundred varas long and eight hundred wide, compris rg exactly four p~rtenencias, is designated by the Alcalde.
It is, I think, apparent, that from 1846 down to a late period

S) 2REME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
the parties interested considered themselves the owners of a
mine, with the number of pertenencias allowed by law-whether
three or four, they seem to have been uncertain-and that this
ownership, acquired by registration and denouncement, carried
with it the ownership of the hacienda or reducing establishment
But they seem to have attached, so far as we can discover from
their acts of sale, proceedings at law, &c., little importance to
the rights in the large tract six thousand varas square, which
the Alcalde assumed to grant them partly on public and partly
on private land. On no other hypothesis can we account for
the omission to mention the word "lands" in any of their conveyances during so long a period.
No inference of fraud can, hovever, be justly drawn from this
circumstance, for the same omission is observable in deeds and
proceedings after the date of the supposed forgery as before it.
But whatever may have been the notions of the parties as to
their rights, it is, I think, plain that the possession given to
Castillero should legally be treated as having included two
entirely distinct objects: one, the mine properly so called, comprising the pit or "pozo de posecion," with the limited number
of' pertenencias allowed by the ordinances; and the other, a
tract of land six thousand varas square, which the Alcalde
assumed to grant, but of which no "fixedpossession was given."
This distinction between the judicial possession of the mine,
which the tribunal having jurisdiction of mining matters had a
right to give, and a grant of more than a square league of lan,
partly on private and partly on public, is not only admitted but
insisted on by the counsel for the claimant. its importance will
appear hereafter when we come to consider the alleged "ratification" of the mining possession by the Supreme Government.'
By art. 14, tit. vi., of the Ordinances of 1783, it is provided,
that "Any one may discover and denounce a vein or mine, not
only in common land, but also in the private lands of any individual; provided he pays for the land of which he occupies the
tmurtce, and the damage which immediately ensues therefrom,
according to the valuation of experts appointed by both p,rties.

with respect to him -who denounces a place (sitio) or waters for
estab"ishing works, and working the machines necessary for the
reduction of ores, which are called haciendas; provided they
do not include more land, nor use more water than may bo
necessary."
It is not pretended that in this case any denouncement of a
sitio or of waters for a hacienda, was made. Had such been tho
case, and the title to a hacienda duly acquired by the mineowners, it may well be that, as affirmed by Mr. Forbes, a sale of
a barra, or share, in the mine would have conveyed, by Mexican
usages, a corresponding interest in the hacienda. Bat' the par
ties appear to have selected and taken possession of this hacienda
relying on the grant of six thousand varas square, made by thL,
Alcalde, or on some arrangement made with Berreyesa, the
reputed owner of the land.
Antonio Maria Pico, in his last deposition, seems to desire it to
be understood that Berreyesa gave an oral assent to the grar-t
provided it did not include the level land; and in a previous
deposition before the Land Commissioners, the same witness
testified that a written contract was entered into between Berreyesa and the owners of the mine, by which the former was to
have a share in the mine, and was to be paid for the wood and
limestone. used in the establishment. After the possession was
given, Berreyesa demanded a compliance with the contract, and
wrote to Padie Real to that effect. It does not appear that any
arrangement was entered into with him. He was soon after
killed by the Americans, and the hacienda and tract of three
thousand varas in every direction has remained in the possession
of the New Almaden Company to this day.
I am unable to perceive how, under these circumstances, and
in the absence of any denouncement of the sitio used for a
hacienda, Castillero can be deemed to have acquired, by the
attempted concession of the Alcalde, any title whatever to lands
beyond the limits of the. pertenencias which the law allowed.
With respect to these, the Ordinance does not expressly declare
whether the denouncer of a vein or mine on private land is
reclui -d to pay.for -the land of which he occupies the surface as

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
a condition precedent to the vesting of his title. It would seeni
that he is not.
The denouncement or formal declaration of discovery is evidently the first step to be taken; the pit is then to be dug and
the discoverer is, by the terms of Art. iv., to be put At once into
possession. No provision is here made for a suspension of proceedings until the land can be valued and paid for, nor until the
expiration of ninety days can the denouncee be sure that some
one having a better right will not present himself; as the private
land owner is only to be paid for the surface land which is occuDied, and the ensuing damage, it would seem impossible to ascertain what amount of surface land is to be occupied until the
number of pertenencias is fixed and their boundaries marked
out, which can only be done when judicial possession is given.
The ordinance seems to contemplate a claim or proceeding
instituted by the land owner; for it provides that the land shall
be appraised by experts appointed by both parties. If, therefore, the payment for the land, and satisfaction for damages, are
conditions precedent to the vesting of any title to the mine, the
land owner might, by refusing to appoint an expert, indefinitely
postpone its acquisition-thus defeating the policy of the Mining
Laws, as well as the right of the discoverer, which those laws so
filly recognized, and so amply protected. For it is not to be
forgotten, that under the Spanish as well as all other Mining
Ordinances, the discoverer was considered the true owner and
creator of the wealth he had discovered, and that the grantee of
the superficies had merely the right to an idemnity for actual
damage done by the occupation of a small portion of the surface.
But to hDld, under the circumstances of this case, that no title
vested by denouncement and discovery, because the claim of
Berreyesa was not first satisfied, would be peculiarly ineqnitable.
The mine, it is true, was generally understood to be on his
land, and denounced as such. But no judicial measurement of
his land had been made, nor were his boundaries established. It
is to this day unsettled, whether in fa-t the mine is within the
boundaries of Berreyesa, or those of his ueischbor. Justo Larios

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

287

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
or without both, on public land. Had Berreyesa been paid, as
required by the ordinances, it may yet prove that the payment
was unnecessary, because the mine was on public land; or to the
wrong person, because it is on the land of Justo Larios. Where
land was gratuitously distributed in tracts from one to eleven
square leagues in extent, the indemnity which experts would have
awarded for the occupation of a few rectangles of the surface,
two hundred varas long by two hundred wide, would have been
little more than a nominal sum; and to defeat the meritorious
title of a discoverer, because under such circumstances the
indemnity was not paid, would seem unjust and absurd.
The next question to be considered on this branch of the case
is, whether the Alcalde had, under Mexican laws, jurisdiction to
receive denouncements, make registrations, and adjudicate the
titles of mines.
By art. iv., tit. vi., of the Ordinancei of 1783, the discoverer
was required to present himself before the Deputation of that
Territory (territorio), or the one nearest if-there should be none
there.
It is unnecessary particularly to examine the nature and organization of the Special Tribunals to which the ordinance refers.
It is sufficient to say that they were composed of deputies chosen
by the enrolled miners of each mining territory, who themselves
were members of the great mining corporation or body of matriculated miners throughout the Kingdom of New Spain.
These Special Tribunals were in the Federal territory abolished by the Constution of 1826 and by the law of 1837.
But by the law of December 2d, 1842, Courts of First Instance,
composed of three Territorial Deputies elected in: the manm r
prescribed in the ordinance, were required to be established in
each of the Departments by the Governor, in concert with the
Departmental Junta, and with the previous approval of the
Supreme Government.
To these Courts were given substantially the powers formerly
possessed by the Territorial Deputations under the ordinances.
Under this law mining tribunals were established in various
Departments, but n )e were ever organized in the Californias.

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
It is contended, that inasmuch as these tribunals existed iM

some parts of Mexico, it was the duty of the discoverer to address
himself to the one nearest to his mine; and that that tribunal
alone had jurisdiction in the premises.
It is not disputed, as a general principle of Mexican law, that
in default of any of the authorized special tribunals, their functions devolve upon the Courts of general jurisdiction. The
question then is, was there any special tribunal to which the discoverer of a mine in the Department of the Californiaa. could
address himself.
It seems to be considered by the counsel for the United States,
that the provision 6f the ordinance which directs the discoverer
to the deputation of the nearest territorio, in default of any
deputation within his own territorio, of necessity directs him to
the nearest Departmental Court organized under the law of 1842,
if there be none in his own Department. But this provision of
the ordinance is not adopted or alluded to in the law of 1842,
The small territorios, in each of which a Mining Deputation was
by the Ordinances of 1783 to be established, in no respect corresponded to the great divisions of the Mexican Republic called
"Departments," in a single one of which both the Californias
were included. The Deputies under the ordinances were to be
elected in each Real or Asiento of mines by the 'iatriculated
miners "of that plad' (lugar), whose names were embraced in

a book kept by the Judge and Notary of that mining place
(Mineria).
I am not informed what were the ordinary territorial limits
of the Reales or Asientos of mines here spoken of; but it is
obvious that they could not have been larger than would be consistent with the convenience of the miners who were required to
enroll their names, and every year to vote at elections. When,
therefore, it happened that in a newly discovered mining district, no deputation had been elected, the discoverer was reason.
ably directed to the nearest deputation, which would ordinarily
be at no great distance.
But to send him to a remote Department of Mexico on such an
errand would be absurd, and a practical denial to him of any

right whatever to register his mine. Nor could in such case the
othei provisions of the ordinances be complied with; for to
what purpose affix notices on the doors of the churches in
Chihaahua, that an individual had discovered or denounced a
mine in Upper California, and how could one of the Deputies
personally go, and within ninety days inspect the mine, examine
the pit, and give the possessionas enjoined by the. ordinances?
That no such proceedings could have been contemplated by
the law of 1842, is also clear from the terms of the law itself.
The Governor and Junta of each"Department were to estAblish,
as .we have seen, as many Courts of First Instance as were required within their limits.
It is to be presumed that the jurisdiction of each of thes6
Courts was restricted to the territorial limits assigned to it; but
* certainly did not extend beyond the.boundaries of the Department. Art. xxvI., provides, -that "Each one of these Courts
shall exercise within its territory the executive and economicAl
powers given by the old ordinance," &c, How, then, can' it be
supposed that, organized under the authority of the Department,
and with its jurisdiction restricted to-its territory, it could take
cognizance of mining matteis in another Department, separated
from it by hundreds of leagues, aid with which communications
were rare and difficult.
It is, I think, beyond doubt, that at the time of the discovery
_f this mine, 1here were not only no special tribunals in Calil
.ornia which had jurisdiction in mining matters, but there were
none anywhere established in Mexico which possessed jurisdiction to make a registration of a mine discovered in California.
On the principle of Mexican law already referred, the functions
of the special tribunals, under these circumstances, devol-v ed on
the Courts of ordinary jurisdiction-or rather the jurisdiction
remained in them, as it had done in the Federal Territory from
the adoption of the Constitution of 1824 and the law of 1837; it
never havihg been divested in this Department by the establish.
ment of special tribunals tinder the law of 18412.

in the Californias, the jurisdiction must have been vested in the
Alcaldes, for no ordinary Courts of First Instance existed.
By the decree of May 23, 1839, the judiciary of each of the
Departments was to be composed of Justices of the Peace, Alcaldes, Judges of First Instance, and a Superior Tribunal.
But this organization was not perfected in the Californias, and
the Alcaldes in this Department appear to have exercised the
functions and jurisdiction which would otherwise have belonged
to the Courts of First Instance.
In the decree of March 2, 1843, it is stated, that in the Cali.
fornias there had been no Courts of Second and Third Instance
established in the Californias, New Mexico, and -Tabasco; and
by Act 28th, the Governors of those Departments are ordered
"to take care that justice is punctually and completely administered in First Instances by Judges of that grade, if there be such,
or by Alcaldes, or Judges of the Peace." But even if the authority of an Alcalde to take cognizance of mining matters were
doubtful, it ought, I think, to be sustained as that of a defacto
officer exercising an undisputed jurisdiction.
The registration of a mine was a simple proceeding, of which
the principal objects were to apprise the Government of its existence, so that'it might secure its portion of the produce-to
give an opportunity to other persons to show a better right than
that of the alleged discoverer or denouncer, and to subject the
latter to the salutary rules of the ordinance as to its working
and preservation. When the discoverer had made known his
discovery in the manner prescribed by law, and dug his pit of
possession, the law itself gave him the title.
It would seem, therefore, that if the discoverer addressed himself to the only judicial authority of the country, and if that
authority, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the Governor
and inhabitants of the Department, took cognizance of the matter
and adjudicated the mine to him, a presumption in favor of the
rightful exercise of power ought to be indulged. Nor should
we affirm the Alcalde's acts to be void, except on the clearest
proofs that he was wholly without jurisdiction in the premises.
Having thus seen that by tht discovery and regrstration of his

mine, and by the possession given by the Alcalde, Castillero.
acquired a right to the mine, with the number of pertenencias
allowed by law, I proceed to inquire what number of pertenencias he thus became entitled to.
By art. 1, tit. vi., of the ordinances, it is provided that "the
discoverers of one or more mineral hills, (cerros,) absolutely new,
in which there is no mine nor trial pit open, may acquire in the
principal vein which they select, as many as three perteneucias,
continuous-or interrupted, according to the measurements which
are hereinafter prescribed; and if 'they have discovered more
veins, they may have one pertenencia in each vein, said pertenencias being discovered and marked out within the term of ten
days."
Art. 2, tit. xi., provides: "Although by these ordinances 1
prohibit any individual miner who works in the ordinary limits
from denouncing two contiguous veins on the same vein-not
withstanding this, I grant to those who work in company,
although they be not discoverers, and without prejudice to the
right which by reason thereof they may have in case they are
such, (y sin perjuicio del derecho que por este titulo deban tener
en caso de que lo sean,) the right to denounce four new pertenencias or mines which haye been worked and abandoned, even
when they are contiguous and on the same course.".
It is claimed that, under these provisions, Castillero was entitled as a 4iscoverer to three pertenencias, and as one working
in company, to four additional pertenencias, making seven in
all.
The counsel for the United States contends that the allowances
of pertenencias mentioned in the foregoing articles, are not cumu.ative; and that four,'or the number given to him who works'
in company, are all that can be acquired.
The determination of this question entirely depends upon the
trne meaning of the Spanish text. The counsel for the United
8tates insists that the Spanish phrase quoted above reads when
properly translated: "And without prejudice to the right which
by this title [viz., that of discoverers] they may be entitled to
have in case that they may be such."

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
That is, that although it was prohibited to an individual miner
to denounce two contiguous mines, yet those who work in com.
pany may denounce four pertenencias, either new and unopened,
or old and abandoned mines; and this right is not to prejudice
their rights as discoverers, in case at any time thereafter they
may become such.
If, however, we attribute a present and not a future signification to the verb, the meaning of the phrase would be, that all
persons working in company shall have four pertenencias, and
shall enjoy this right without prejudice to their rights as discoverers, in case they are such; that is, all persons working in
company shall have four pertenencias, and if they be also
discoverers, their rights as such shall remain to them.
I do not pretend to be able to determine, from a knowledge
of the Spanish, which is the true translation of the phrase. .1
have therefore addressed myself for information to several per.
sons skilled ii that language. They all concur in adopting the
translation suggested by the claimants.
There are some general considerations which serve to
strengthen my belief in its correctness.
The object of the law was to determine the extent of mining
spaces, or pertenencias, to be allowed to miners. As the merit
of the discoverer was greater than that of one who merely
denounced a forfeited mine, and as the policy of the law was to
encourage and reward discoveries, it gave to the discoverer,
though working alone, three pertenencias, if his discovery were
of an absolutely new hill, in which no mine had been opened;
but if the discovery were of a new vein in a hill known and
worked in other p-rts, he was allowed 'to acquire two pertenencias. It was also the policy of the law to promote the development of mines by encouraging the formation of companies, the
associated capital of which would enable them to prosecute the
works on a larger scale and with greater efficiency. Title ix,
in the 1st article, enjoins upon the Viceroy to encourage,
promote, and protect all such partnerships by all conv enient
measures.
In furtherance of the same policy, article 2d gives to all those

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
Te United Stales vs. Andres Castillero.
who work in company the right to acquire either four new and
unopened pertenencias, or four mines (of one pertenencia each)
which have been worked and abandoned. The law which prohibited the acquisition of two contiguous pertenencias by an
ordinary miner, is pro tanto repealed, while those which determined the rights of discoverers are allowed to remain.
Such would seem the natural mode of carrying out the evident
policy of the law-giver.
For why should the ordinary miner be rewarded with three
additional pertenencias, because he works in company, and the
discoverer only be allowed one additional pertenencia?
The law recognizes the two species of merit-that of discovery,
and that of working in 'company. If a miner possesses both,
ought he not to receive the rewards allowed for both?
The phrase, "and without prejudice to their rights as dis.
coverers," &c., is evidently intended to guard against interpretaiion of the provision prejudicial to the rights of the discoverers.
IL is the exclusion of a possible conclusion which might otherwise have been drawn.
But could it have been sapposed that because persons working
itcompany are to have four pertenencias, no one of them could
have the rights of a discoverer, if at any future time, and perhaps
at a distance from his mine, he discovered an entirely.new hill?
Such a constrmction of the provisions in favor of partnerships
would have been wholly unwarranted. This could not, therefore, have been the conclusion intended to be excluded. But it
might have been supposed that the law, in giving to partnerships
four pertenencias, meant to fix the maximum number of con.
tiguous mines which the same individuals could in any case
acquire. If, as discoverers, they were already entitled to three
the formation of the partnership would give them but one more.
Both provisions would thus have been satisfied. Three Qf the
pertenencias would be held by a double title-that of dist-Avery,
and that of working in partnership-while the fourth wo7uld be
given for the latter reason alone.
To guard against this construction, the provision was'ij$erted
that the allowance to partners should be without prejudice to

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
their rights as discoverers, in case they were such; and in this
view the provision was sensible, and perhaps necessary. It left
to each kind of 'merit its appropriate reward, and gave to the
minex -6o united both in himself, all the privileges which the
.aw attached to each.
I am, therefore, of opinion, that under the Mining Ordinances
referred, Castillero, as a discoverer, and as one working in company, was entitled to seven pertenencias.
Having thus ascertained what acts were done and rights
acquired by Castillero in California, we will next consider the
title claimed to have been obtained by him from the Supreme
Government of Mexico.
The facts as alleged by the claimants, are as follows:
Early in 1846, and while he was yet in California, Castillero,
impressed with the importance of the brilliant discovery he had
made, communicated the fact in two letters addressed to J. J.
De Herrera, former President of Mexico, dated at the Mission
of Santa Clara on the 19th and 22d February, 1846, respectively,
and also in another letter written on the last mentioned day to
Don Tomas Ramon del Moral, at Mexico.
These letters, together with some specimens of cinnabar and a
small flask of quicksilver, were sent by the hands of Lazaro
Pifa, who sailed from Monterey for Mazatlan in the brig
Hannah, in the early part of March, 1846.
Extracts from the- two letters to Herrera were, it appears,
furnished by him to Seor Moral, and a note embodying these
extracts, together with a copy of Ca tillero's. letter to himself,
were, by SeAor Moral, about the middle of April, 1846, communicated to the Junta de Fomento y Administrativa de Mineria,
a bodi chargeo with the development and encouragement of
mining interests in Mexico, and the administration of certain
Funds connected with the same object.
There were also transmitted by Moral to the Junta, at the
same time, some specimens of cinnabar which had been delivered
to him by Pifia.
On the 21st April, 1846, the Junta addressed a letter to Jos6
Maria Tornel, Director of the College of Mining, transmitting to

him copies of Castillero's letters and the specimens of cinnabar,
and requesting that an assay might be made of the latter.
On the 23d April, Tornel, by an order on the margin of the
letter of the Junta, directed the specimens to be sent to the
Junta Facultativa, or Faculty of the College, for assay.
The result of the assay was communicated to Tornel by Sefnor
Moral, President of the Junta Facultativa, on the 24th April,
1846, and the receipt of this letter was acknowledged on the
29th of the same month by Tornel, who, on .the same day transmitted the letter of Moral of the 24th, announcing the result of
the assay, to the Junta de Fomento. His official communication
on the subject was received by them on the 3d May, and on the
4th, ordered by an "acuerdo" or marginal order to be sent to thd
Government. Oni the succeeding day, viz., the 5th, a communication signed by Vicente Segura, President of the Junta, and
Isidro R. Gondra, First Clerk, was accordingly addressed to the
Minister of Justice, in which was stated the reception of the
specimens, and their transmission to the Director of the College
for assay. A copy of the communication of the Director of the
College, stating the result of the assay, was also embodied in the
Junta's letter, and the Minister of Justice was informed that the
Junta had already asked Castilero what kind of aid or protec
tion he needed for the encouragement of his brilliant enterprise,
&c., &c.
This letter was received by the Minister of Justice on the 9th
May, as shown by the marginal note of its contents and reception, and on the same day the Minister formally acknowledged
its receipt in a dispatch addressed to the Junta.
On the 12th May, 1846, Castillero, who had sailed from California in the barque Don Quixote, and arrived in Mexico, submitted to the Junta nine propositions in writing, in which he
indicated the kind of aid and protection he required. He had
previously,, however, appeared before them, given a verbal
account of his discovery, and been requested by the Junta to
furnish a written statement as to what aid he required.
On the 14th May, 1846, the Junta transmitted the written
statement of Castillero to the Minister of Justice, retaining a

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
copy in their own office. In this communication of the Junta,
the Government is urged to accept the propositions of Castillero.
Among the propositions thus made by Castillero to the Junta,
and by the latter transmitted to the Minister of Justice, were the
following:
"7th. The Junta shall represent to the Supreme Government
the necessity of approving the possession which has been given
me of the mine, by the local authorities, in the same terms as
those which I now hold it."
"8th. Ii shall also represent the advantage of there being
granted to me, as a colonist, two square leagues upon the land
of my mining possession, with the object of being able to use
the wood for my burnings."
The communication of the Junta, inclosing the propositions
of Castillero, and urging'their acceptance, was received by the
Minister of Justice, and on the 20th May, the following "acuerdo"
was noted on the margin:
"Granted in the terms which are proposed, and with respect
to the land, let the corresponding order issue to the Minister of
Relations for the proper measures of his office, with the understanding that the Supreme Government accedes to the petition."
This " acuerdo" is signed with the rubric of Becerra, Minister
of Justice.
On the same day (May 20th) Becerra addressed to the Presi
dent of the Junta an official dispatch, as follows:
"Ministry cf Justice and Public Instruction.
"MOST EXCELLENT SIR :-Having reported to His Excellency,
the President ad interim of the Republic, your Excellency's communication of the 14th inst., with which you were pleased tu
transmit with a recommendation the petition of Seffor Don
Andres Castillero, for the encouragement of a quicksilver mine
which he has discovered in the Mission of Santa Clara, in Upper
California, His Excellency has been pleased to approve in all its
parts the agreement made with that individual in order to commencee the working of said mine, and on this day the corresponding communication is made to the Minister of Exterior Relations
and Government, to issue the proper orders with respect to that

which is contained in the 8th proposition for the grant of lands
in that Department.
"I repeat to your Excellency the assurance of m& esteem.
'God and Liberty.. Mexico, 20th May, 1846.
11BEcr6RRA.
"To His Excellency, D. Vicente Segura,
President of the Junta de Fomento de Mineria."
On the same day Becerra addressed'to the Minister of Relations an official communication, in which he transcribes the foregoing dispatch to Segura, and adds:
"And I have the honor to transcribe to your Excellency, to
the end that with respect to the petition of Seffor Castillero to
which his Excellency the President ad interim has thought proper
to accede, that there be granted to him as a colonist two square.
leagues upon the land of his mining possession, your Excellency
will be pleased to issue the orders corresponding."
In obedience to these orders, the Minister of Exterior Relations, Castillo Lanzas, on the 23d of May, 1846, directed an
official dispatch to Pio Pico, Governor of California, in which.
after transcribing the foregoing communication of Becerra, he
says:
"Wherefore I transcribe it to your Excellency, in order that
in conformity with what is prescribed by the laws and dispositions upon colonization, you-may put Seior Castillero in possession of the two square leagues which are mentioned.
"God and Liberty, Mexico, May 23d, 1846.
"1CASTILLO LANZAS.
To His Excellency the Governor of the Department of the
Californias."
Upon these last dispatches, viz., that from Becerra to the Junta
de Fomento, of May 20th, and that from Castillo Lanzas to the
Governor of California, of May 23d, the claimants rely, as constituting a ratification of the grant by the Alcalde of three thousand varas in every direction, and a concession of two square
leagues of land. They also claim that the "acuerdo" or margi
na order found in the comiiunication of the Junta of May 14th:

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
1846, amounts, in equity at least, to a concession of all that the
Junta recommended.
The proofs of the foregoing allegations consist of a large
number of espedientes from various public offices in Mexicoof certified copies of the actas or minutes of the proceedings of
the two Juntas, viz., the Junta de Fomento and the Junta Facultativa, of the College of Mining-of certified transcripts of entries
in official books of the Ministers, and of.the parol testimony of
Members of the Juntas, Clerks in the offices by whom the documents were written, and of the Minister himself, Castillo Lanzas,
who was the author 6f the dispatch of May 23d. These witnesses swear, not only to the existence of the archi've8, the hand
writing and the genuineness of the various documents, traced
copies of which are produced, and to the accuracy of those
copies, but also to the facts stated to have occurred, or to such
parts of the transactions as each was personally concerned in.
Some of' these witnesses, who were brought from Mexico by
the claimants at great expense, have held distinguished official
positions, are of advanced years, and independent fortunes.
The United States aver that their testimony is false and perjured, and that the documents sworn to by them are forged and
ante-dated. To arrive at a just estimate of the force of the
evidence and reasons on which the United States rely to support
this accusation, a brief statement of the nature and amount of
the proofs offered by the claimant is necessary.
In the short summary of the evidence which I propose to
give, I shall follow rather the chronological sequence of the
events alleged to have occurred, than the order in which the
various documents were produced.
It will be remembered that the Junta de Fomento was first
notified of the discovery of a mine of quicksilver by Castillero,
by receiving from Don Tomas Ramon del Moral a communication, containing copies of letters from Castillero, that this communication was sent to the-Director of the College that an assay
might be made, and by him referred to the President of the
Faculty, who in due time reported the result of the assay to the

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castdlero.
President, who in turn communicated it to the Junta, and the
latter to the Minister of Justice.
There is accordingly produced from the Archives of the
College of Mining the original communication of the Junta de
FPemento, signed by the President, Vicente Segura, and, ad.
dressed to the Director of the College, together with copies of
the communication of Moral, which, with the specimens of
cinnabar, were sent to the Director. The accuracy of the traced
copy produced, and the existence of the original in the College
of Mining, is testified to by Jos6 Maria de Bassoco, for many
years a member of the Junta, and by Balcarcel and Castillo,
Professors in the College. These witnesses also swear to the
handwriting of the dispatch, and of the copies of the letters, to
the genuineness of the signatures of Vicente Segura, President
of the Junta, and of Gondra, the Chief Clerk of the Junta, who
certifies to the copies which accompany the dispatch. On the
margin of the dispatch is an acuerdo, or order signed "Tornel,"
directing it to be sent to the Junta Facultativa. The fact .that
Tornel was Director of the College, and the genuineness of his
signature, are also proved by the same witnesses.
From the archives of the Junta Facultativa of the College,
are produced traced copies of the minutes of a session of the
Board on the 24th April, 1846, (erroneously dated 24th March).
These minutes show a resolution of the Board, that a report of
what had been done, and the result of the assay made by Professor Herrera, be communicated to the Director of the College.
From the same archives is produced a traced copy of -the reply
of the Director General Tornel to the report of the Board, in
which he acknowledges the receipt of a letter from Moral,
President of the Faculty, of the 24th April, communicating the
result of the assay. The accuracy of these traced copies, and
the existence, genuineness and handwriting of the originals, are
1)oved by the Professors Castillo and Balcarcel, who were present at the meeting of the Faculty, and who not only sweai to
their personal recollection of the facts, but also testify that the
cinnabar was received, an assay made, a meeting of the Faculty
on the subject held, and the specimens deposited with appro.

The accuracy of the traced copies, the existence and hand;
writing of the originals, where those originals are borradors or
drafts, and the existence and handwriting of the signatures
to the originals, where they are the oiigiual communications
received by the Junta, are proved by Mr.jBassoco, by the Professors Balcarcel and Castillo, by Miranda and Yrisarri, who
were emp'loyed in the Ministry of Justice, by Manuel Couto, who
testifies that he copied CasUllero's petition from his rough draft,
and by Castillo Lauzas, the 'former Minister of Relations of
Mexico.
From the archives of the Ministry of Relations, t6 which the

It may here be observed, that from the archives of the Ministry of Relations is also produced a traced copy of the communication of Pio Pico, of February 13, 1846, addressed to the Minister of Relations, informing him of Castillero's discovery, and
transmitting Castillero's letter of December 10th, 1845. There
is also produced from the same archives a traced copy of the

the archives of the offices to which they belong, their handwriting,
and the genuineness of the signatures they bear, are sworn to
by the escribiemt -., or clerks, by whom they were copied, some
of whom are till connected with the Ministries, by M. de Bassoco, and by the ex-Minister Castillo Lanzas himself.
There is also produced a traced copy of an extract from a

United Stales vs. Andres Castillero.

It contains various entries or notes, purporting to have been
made from May 11th, 1846, to May 20th, 1846. Amongst those
made on the 20th, is an entry of the membrete o."memorandum
of contents of the Junta's letter to the Minister, of May 14th. and
of the acuerdo or resolution taken by the Minister on th6 subject. On the top of the first page on which the communication
of the Junta is written, are found these letters and figures
"L. g' 15, S. f. 140 v '"
Jos6 M. Yrisarri, the Fifth Oficial of the Ministry of Justice,
being interrogated as to the meaning of this inscription, testifies
that it means "Libro General, vol. 15; reverse of page 140," and
that the entry already mentioned is found in the volume and
page referred to. He further states that this inscription, or
reference, was made by himself, as was also the entry on the
book to which it refers.
The original dispatch of Becerra to the Mimster of Relations,
is stated by Miranda and Yrisarri, to be in the handwriting of
the former. The "acuerdo" on the margin is said by Castillo
Iauzas to be in his ewn handwriting and signed with his genuine rubric; and the draft of the dispatch addressed by him to
Pio Pico, to be in the handwriting of Mr. Quintanar, an employ6
f. the Ministry of Relations in 1846. The original dispatch
addressed to Pio Pico is proved to be in the Lan'writing of A.
J. de Velasco, by Castillo Lanzas, and by Velasco himself. The
signature of Castillo Lanzas is proved by Lafrague, former Minister of Relations in Mexico, by Velasco, who wrote the dispatch.
and by Castillo Lanzas himself.
It is also testified by Mr. Negrete, that this identical dispatch
was handed to him in December, 1846, by Castillero; that a copy
of it was inserted in the instrument by which 'astillero ratified
the McNamara contract, and the original sent by him (Negrete)
to Alexander Forbes, of Tepic, on the 19th of December, 1846.
In corroboration of this statement of Mr. Negrete, there is produced a series of letters written by him to Alexander Forbes,
from December 5th, 1846, to February 6, 1847. In these letters
Mr. Negrete informs Mr. Forbes of the state of his then pending
negotiation with Castillero; and in his letter of December 18tb,

804

advises him that he transmits "the document showing the grant
which the Supreme Government made in favor of Don Andres
Castillero for two leagues of land,'" &c.
These letters, which Mr. Negrete swears he saw for the first
time since they were written, when produced to him by the
claimants in this country, he testifies are in his own handwriting and that of his clerk, Orua, and signed by himself. He
also identifies three checks or orders drawn by himself on his
banker, Don Donato Manterola; one in favor of Castillero for
$4,000, and receipted by the latter, and two in favor of DoT
Nazario Fuentes, the Notary, for $137.25, and $29.75, respec
tively, both of which are receipted by Fuentes.
The testimonio or authenticated copy of Castillero's instru
ment of ratification, containing the Lanzas dispatch, is exhibited
It is signed by Nazario Fuentes, the Notary Public, whose signature and signo are attested by three Notaries Public in a certificate under the seal of the National College of Notaries of
Mexico, dated December 19, 1846.
A second copy of the, same instrument, issued from the office
of the Notary Fuentes, under his hand and seal, is also prodi'ced.
It is dated February 6, 1847, and is certified by three Notamnes
Public, under the hand and seal of the National College of
Notaries. Among the three Notaries signing these certificates
is Villalon. This gentleman has been examined as a witness.
He testified that his signature and" signo on each of the certificates are genuine, that they were affixed at their respective
dates; that the signatures of the other Notaries are genuine, as
is also the seal of the National College. It is also shown that
this instrument of the ratification was brought to California by
Mr. Walkinshaw -in 1847, when he took charge of the mine'
and the terms of James Alexander Forbes' ratification, in which
the language of Castillero's act is copied, show that the latter
must have been before him when writing his own ratification of
the McNamara contract-a conclusion rendered certain by the
very-distinct allusion in Forbes' letter of May 5, 1847, "to the
possession of two sitios ordered to be given by the dispatch of
Sefior Castillo Lanzas."

The claimants have also produced from the Archives of the
Junta do Fomento, traced copies of the original borradores, or
drafts, of the minutes of the Junta in April, May, September,
November and December, 1849; also a traced copy of the clean
copy made from those minutes, and authenticated by the rubrics
of the members of the Junta who assisted at the sessions; and
finally, a copy of the .entire volume 3d of the Minutes of the
Junta from April 2, 1846, to June 30, 1847.
In these minutes, amongst a great number of other.-entries, we
find a record of the action of the Junta from the reception of the
specimens of cinnabar to- the payment of the Notary Calapiz,
wtien further proceedings were abandoned.
In the Actas of the session of April 23d, 1846, is an entry of
the receipt of specimens of cinnabar from the Presidio of Santa
Clara; in Calfornia, and a resolution that they be sent, with
copies of Castillero's letters, to the Director for assay.
On the 4th of May, the receipt of.the letter of the Director
inserting the report of the Junta Faculatativa is noted, and it is
resolved that it be transcribed to the Supreme Government,
representing that a reply has been made to Senor Castillexo,
asking him what kind of protection or assistance he requires
On the 6th of May, the Actas show that Don Andres Castil
lero appeared and made a verbal report, &c., and the Junta
resolved that Setior Castillero should present his indications in
writing. On the 14th of May, the receipt of the communication
from the Minister of Justice dated May 9th is noted.
On the 25th of May is a like note of. the receipt of Beceria's
dispatch of the 20th, approving the agreement made with Castillero, &c., arid a resolution of the Junta that the proner judicial
agreement be drawn up imrnediately, &c.

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
Aichives of the Junta, and the genuineness of his own rubrics
and those of his colleagues affixed to them.
The claimants have also produced, and filed as an exhibit, an
original report made by the Junta de Fomento to the Minister
of Justice relative to the matters confided to its care. This
report is embodied in a report made to the National Congress
by Jos6 M. Lafragua, Minister of Relations, and read before
that body on the 14th, 15th, and 16th December, 1846.
The original manuscript "Memoria," or report by the Junta,
is stated by Mr. Bassoco, to have been procured by himself from
Escalante, the agent of Lafragua. Its proper place of custody
was the Ministry of Relations, but M. de Bassoco supposes that
it had probably been taken by Mr. Lafragua to his own house,
when the latter was preparing his report to the National Congress, and accidentally remained among his papers. He identifies the signatures and rubrics of Vicente Segura and Isidoro R.
Gondra, which are affixed to it, and states his conviction that it
is the identical document sent in by the Junta to the Minister.
On referring to the "Actas" of the Junta, we find it noted on
the 5th of November, 1846, that a dispatch was received from
the Minister of Relations, dated November 3d, calling for an
account of tae labors of the Junta, to be furnished within eight
days.
It also appears, that on the 9th the reading of the report was
commenced; that it was concluded at the session of the 16th,
and a resolution adopted, that the report should be transmitted
to the Government; and that on the 5th of December. a corn
munication from the Minister acknowledging its receipt was
received by the Junta.
Two copies of the report of Lafragua, in which the Memoria
was embodied, are also offered in evidence by the claimants. It
is a printed volume of considerable size.
Of these copies, one was originally produced by the olaimants
and identified by Mr. Lafragua, Mr. Bassoco and others.
A second copy has recently been produbed and identified by
the Hon. J. P. Benjamin, one of the counsel in the cause ,
having b,.en received by him in 1849, from Don Jos6 Garay, the

validity of whose grant he was -then investigating. The volume
remained in Mr. Benjamin's possession until about two years
ago, when Mr. Rockwell, also of counsel for claimants called on
him to retain him in this cause. In the course of conversation
Mr. R. alluded to an official report of Mr. ILafragua, which, in
his opinion, contained conclusive proof of the genuineness of the
title of the claimant. From his description' Mr. Benjamin
thought he recognized the volume in his possession as the one
referred to, and immediately procured it from an adjoining room.
On examination it was found to contain the passages relating to
tha discovery of the mine, &c., which are found in the copy pre.
viously produced by the claimants. Mr. Benjamin was not,
until that time, aware that it contained anything in reference to
the mine. At Mr. Rockwell's request, he allowed him-to retain
the volume, which he recognizes as the one now produced.
The claimants have also offered in evidence fies of the
"Diario," the "Republicano," and the "Monitor Republicano,"
newspapers, in which the reading of Lafragua's report, on the
14th, 15th and 16th December, 1846, is noticed.
It is unnecessary to extract at length the passages in this
report, in which reference is made to Castillero's discovery, and
the action of the Government upon it.
They merely contain an account of the presentation of the
specimens to the Junta by Senor Moral-the assay, the inquiry
of Castillero as to the assistance he desired, his petition, and the
Junta's agreement to it; the approval of the agreement by the
Supreme Government, and the failure to carry it into effect,
owing to the order of the Supreme Government, of May 10th,
1846, directing the suspension of all payments from the public
Treasury.
In the foregoing statement of the documentary and 3ther
proofs on which the claimants rely to show the action, by the
Mexican authorities, in reference to the important discovery of
Castillero, much evidence as to various handwritings, signatures.
&c., has been omitted.
Enough has been set forth to show the nature and the force

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
of the proofs offered in support of the genuineness of the documents exhibited.
It - ill be seen that the proofs do not consist of any one set of
papers derived from a single office, the archives of which might
have been falsified and the officials corrupted.
Each document is found in two, and some in three, distinct
repositories. The barradores are produced from the offices from
which the communications emanated; the originals from the
offices to which they were sent; and in some instances the coinmunications are, according to the Mexican custom, inserted in
dispatches from the office to which they were originally directed,
and those dispatches are found in the archives of the Ministry
to which they are addressed.
All the papers are so intimately connected and complicated
with each other, that it is almost impossible to suppose any one
to have been fabricated, unless the whole series be spurious.
They are written in various handwritings, with a multitude of
signatures, rubrics, etc., of well-known individuals attached to
them. The same document contains, in some instances, no leEs
than four different handwriting-,, viz., that of the clerk who drew
it, of the official who signed it, (,f the clerk who wrote the membrete and acuerdo, and that of the Minister by whom the latter
was signed.
The writing is sworn to be that of clerks attached for many
years to the offices from which the papers emanated. Their
handwriting must, therefore, be well known, and a forgery of it
could readily be detected.
When we consider the long series of forgeries, and the almost
innumerable perjuries, which must have been committed if these
documents are not genuine, the crimes imputed to the witnesses
are as appalling as the extent and almost endless ramifications
of the conspiracy to commit them are incredible.
We must suppose that Professors in a National College, for.
saking their scientific pursuits, have carefully fabricated false
miuutes of the proceedings of the faculty of which they were
inembers; that they have made a tedious and dangerous journey
to sustain, by carefully-prepared peijuries, the forgeries they

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United Slates vs. Andres Castillero.
had committed; and that they have had ingenuitv and lepravity
enough to give to their statements the appearance of truth, by
inventing circumstantial details as to the reception of the apecimens, the assay made of them their deposit in the cabinet of the
College, and even the purport of the tickets or labels upon them,
which, as they state, can be seen by any visitor to te College.
,With regard to the Junta de Fomento, the forgeries and perjuries imputed are still more complicated and improbable. Not
only must the various dispatches alleged to have been addressed
by them to the Director of the College, and to the Minister of
Justice, with the signatures of the President of the Junta, and
of the Secretary the handwriting of the Clerk who drew the
marginal notes upon them, and the rubic of the Minister
appended, have either been forged, or falsely sworn to have been
written at their dates, but a series of actas, which record the
proceedings and resolutions of the Junta, must have been fabri
eated, or extensively interpolated, and the rubrics of the mem
bhrs forged. And, as if reveling in supererogatory crimes, they
mast also have fabricated the borradores, or rou'gh drafts, from
'which the clean copies of the minutes were made out-the
e~istence of which would hardly have been suspected, and
which it would naturally be supposed had been destroyed.
They must also have prepared a voluminous report to the
Minister, in which has been inserted an account of these pro.
ceedings, precisely such as, if they had taken place, we should
expect to find. The manuscript of this report, which is claimed
to have been accidentally left among the private papers of the
Minister to whom it was addressed, must have been forged, or
the interpolated passages inserted in it, in a manner to defy
detection. And they must also, at least as early as 1348, or in
the beginning of 1849, before this case was presented or: a
tribunal constituted to decide upon it, have procured the same
interpolations to be made in the printed report of the Minister
Lafragua, read to the National Congress in December, 1846, a
copy of which was in the hands of Mr. Benjamin at least as
early as the fall of 1849.
After procuring these various forgeries and interpolations to

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
be made, the claimants must have induced numerous witnesses
to elaborate and swear to a series of perjuries-minute, circumstantial and plausible-the invention of which displays nearly
as much skill and ingenuity as the testimony in regard to them
if false, discloses moral turpitude.
They must have succeeded in suborning, not merely a fem
nameless and obscure individuals, but numerous persons in high
official and social positions; and especially Mr. de Bassoco, a
gentleman venerable for his years, and respectable for the
singular intelligence and amenity with which he sustained the
Frotracted, acute, and most searching cross-examination of the
counsel for the United States.
They must also have procured two ex-Ministers of Relations
to perjure themselves, not merely by false testimony before a
Commissioner in Mexico, but in Court, within our jurisdiction
and subject to our laws, with a full knowledge that the Govern.
ment alleged the claim to be spurious, and that no efforts would
be spared to detect and punish those who were concerned in the
supposed conspiracy to defraud it.
Again this vast conspiracy, from its nature, could not have
been successfully carried out without the complicity or connivance, not only of nearly all the officials in the various offices
at the alleged dates of the papers, from the lowest probationary
clerk or "meritorio," up to the Minister of State himself, but
also of those officers employed when the forged papers were
afterwards" placed in the archives, as well as of all those who
still more recently have certified to their genuineness; and yet,
from all these persons concerned in or cognizant of the crime,
no whisper has been heard betraying the important secret. Mr.
Black, the United States Consul, continues to attach his certificate to the papers without suspecting that he might be lending
his aid to a conspiracy to defraud his own Government; and
Mr. Forsyth, the United States Minister to Mexico, and for some
time resident at the Capital, examines the documents at the
various Ministries, and states that "they are found in the several
offices where they appropriately belong, were produced by the

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
officers having custody of them, and that he saw nothing whatever to cause him to doubt their being genuine originals."
But the proofs of the genuineness, in part at least, of the
documents obtained from Mexico, are obtained from another
and an unquestionable source.
Among those documents was found, as has been mentioned,
the dispatch of Pio Pico, with the original letter of Castillero of
December 10th, 1845, conveying to the Supreme Government
the first news of the discovery. There was also produced a
traced copy of the borrador of the reply of the Minister.
It is stated by counsel, that the reception of these documents
from Mexico first suggested to them the propriety of instituting
a search for evidence of the correspondence in the Archives in
the Surveyor-General's office.
The search was accordingly made, and there was found the
draft of Pio Pico's letter to the Minister, the original of the
Minister's reply, together with a letter from Castillero, clearly
referring to a previous one of the 10th December.
I am not aware that the genuineness of these documents produced from the archives in this city is questioned.
It thus appears that the archives from Mexico are corroborated on the only points where, from their own nature, they
were 'susceptible of corroboration by other records.
The existence of the documents now relied on to establish the
title of the claimants, at least as early as the spring of 1847, and
prior to the date of the supposed forgery, is also shown by testimony adduced by the United States.
We have already seen, that in James ,Alexander Forbes' letter
of May 5th, 1847, he alludes to "the possession of two sitios
ordered to be given by the dispatch of Seiior Castillo Lanzas."
In hi'-letter of July 14th, 1847, he speaks of the "two leagues
conceded to Castillero and socios," and throughout his correspolndence frequent and unmistakable allusions occur to the
Lanzas dispatch, with reiterated expressions of distrust of its
validity.
The same objections made to the document in 1847, are repeated and enforced up to February, 1850, long after the date of

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

r

the alleged forgeries, but without the slightest intimation that
during that interval a second Lauzas dispatch had been fabricated. The document now exhibited is open to all the objections, and liable to every criticism originally made, and so
constantly repeated, to the document received by Mr. Forbes in
184:7. He complains, in 1850, that his suggestions relative "to
the attainment of the important document," explained in his
memorandum left at Tepic, in 1849, have not been acted upon.
He expatiates upon the insufficiency and discrepancies of the
Castillo Lanzas dispatch; but he nowhere breathes a word of
reproach or complaint that an abortive and absurd forgery had
been committed, the only result of which had been to leave the
title as "imperfect and ambiguous" as before.
Had such been the case, we learn enough of Mr. Forbes' dis
position from this correspondence to feel sure that reproaches
would not have been spared.
There is one other consideration, and it is the last to which I
shall advert, which naturally leads us to infer, independently of
the proofs, that some proceedings similar to those alleged to have
been had, must have taken place in Mexico.
So far back as the Ordinances of 1783, quicksilver had been
the subject of distinct and special legislation. The fact that it
was indispensably necessary to the extraction of the precious
metals, gave to it an exceptional character, and an ample and
cheap supply of it had been recognized as essential to the development of the mineral wealth of Spain and Mexico.
It is unnecessary to recapitulate the various decrees and laws
of those countries designed to promote the discovery and production of this metal. It is sufficient to say, that out of the
public revenues of Mexico a part had been devoted to the
formation of a fund called the "Fondo de Azogues," to be used
in searching for and developing mines of quicksilver. On every
quintal produced a bounty was paid, and to those who should
succeed in producing a specified quantity per year, a large sum
of money was to be given.
The hope of discovering rich mines of quicksilver within the
Republic had ]ed the Junta to institute expensive explorations

The United &aes vs. Andrea Castillero.

in various parts of the country, and on all sides it seems to have
been considered a national object of primary impor:ance to
liberate the Republic from its almost entire dependence on the
mines of Almaden, from which the chief supply was obtained.
When, therefore, Castillero discovered a mine of which the
"ley" surpassed in richness any that had previously been known,
and when shortly afterwards he proceeded to Mexico, it is not
conceivable that he should have neglected to inform the Junta
of his discovery, and requested of it the assistance in the prosecution of his enterprise which it was one of the most important
objects of its institution to furnish. That he would have desired
the ratification of his mining possession, and especially a grant
of two leagues, we may infer from the fact that he had already
solicited a similar grant from the Governor of California.
That the Junta would have received the announcement with
the utmost satisfaction, and zealously co-operated with him by
recommendations to the Supreme Government, and aiding him
by all means in its power, we might conclude even without any
proofs of the facts; and proceedings similar to those alleged to
have occurred, would have been the natural and almost inevitable consequence.
These proceedings may, it is true, have been interrupted by
the breaking out of war and the alarming condition of public
af airs; nor do the considerations last suggested authorize us to
assume that the dispatch of Becerra, or that of Lanzas, were in
fact written at their dates; but they justify the conclusion that
the proceedings were initiated, and that the records of them
produced from Mexico are at least in part genuine.
laving thus given an imperfect summary of the proofs offered
by the claimants, I proceed to consider some of the objectiQns
urged on the part of the United States.
It is contended that neither Lazaro Piufa, who is alleged tc
have carried the specimens of cinnabar to Mexico, nor Castillero
himself, could have arrived in that city at the time indicated by
the documents produced. If this be true, and an alibi can be
proved as to those petsons, we may well regard with suspicion
documents found to be false in so important a particular. But

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
the proofs offered by the claimants on these points are too cleay
to admit of doubt.
We have already had occasion to notice the letters addressed
by Castillero while in this country to Gen. M. G. Vallejo, at the
christening of whose child he had assisted, and who thus became his compadre.
In a letter addressed to Vallejo, and dated February 21, 1846,
Castllero says: "By the brigantine schooner which brought
these communications," (referring to communications spoken of
in the preceding sentence of the letter) "we have received information," &c. "This vessel sails shortly, and will carry communications of what has occurred lately. Jfyself or Piffa will- leave in it,
or both together. I am only detained waiting the arrival of the
division which may touch here in a day or two."
In another letter dated March 11, 1846, to the same person,
he says: "Pifa embarked on the 4th of this month in Monterey,
and was dispatched in perfect order. He will travel post to
Mexico."
These letters are produced by General Vallejo. He swears
,bat they were received shortly after they were written. The
3ignature and handwriting of Castillero are not disputed. If
antedated, they must have been written by Castillero in Mexico,
and sent on to Vallejo to be produced and sworn to by hima supposition extravagant in itself, and disproved by the intrinsic evidence of the letters themselves, which contain allusions to passing events, and are couched in a style impossible to
invent after the lapse of years.
In corroboration of this statement, the consular books of Mr.
Larkin, then United States Consul at Monterey, have been produced. They are identified by Mr. Swasey, the consular clerk
at that time. From these books it appears that the brigantine
schooner "Hannah" was noted as about to sail to Mazatlan on
the 4th bf March, the day on which Castillero supposed shc had
actually sailed. It also appears that the Consul, desirous of
sending dispatches to the United States, detained her three days,
and a note in his memorandum book shows that she in fact aailed
on the 7th

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

315

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
Shortly after the sailing of the Hannah, becoming alarmed for
the safety of Colonel Fremont, who was then encamped on the
peak of Gavilan, and expecting an attack, Mr. Larkin sent by a
special courier dispatches to Santa Barbara, in the hope of in.
tercepting the Hannah at that port, and of having them conveyed by him to Commodore Sloat at Mazatlan.
That the Hannah arrived at Mazatlan on the. 1st April, we
learn from various sources.
First. The "Diario Oficial," a newspaper published in the City
of Mexico, contains in the number published on the 22d April.
under the head of "Marine news. Mazatlan,-arrivals of vessels," a notice of the arrival at Mazatlan, on the 1st April, of
"the American brigantine schooner 'Hannah' of eighty-nine
tons, Captain Benjamin F. Thusum, and a crew of ten men."
Second. From a letter of Mott, Talbot & Co., merchants of
Mazatlan, addressed to Mr. Thomas 0. Larkin, and found among
his papers since his decease.
This letter is dated "U. S. S. Portsmouth, 1st April, 1846,"
and informs Mr. Larkin that his letters have this moment arrived "per 'Hannah."
Third. Mr. Larkin's letter to Capt. Gillespie, a copy of which
is found in his consular book, which Mr. Swasey swears to have
written himself.
In this letter Mr. Larkin says: Capt. Montgomery, of the
Portsmouth, being under sailing orders (the 1st or 2d instant),
was waiting at Mazatlan for the Mexican mail, when Commodore
Sloat heard per brig Hannah,of the situation of Capt. Fremont
near St. Johns, and immediately dispatched the -ship; she was
twenty-one days from Mazatlan to Monterey."
_Fourth. The positive statement of Mr. Swasey, clerk to Mr.
Larkin, that the latter sent dispatches by the brig Hannah, in
March, 1846, in consequence of which the Portsmouth came to
Monterey.
These proofs leave no room for doubt as to the sailing of the
"Hannah from Monterey, in the early part of March, with Pifia
on board as a passevgdr, unless, indeed, we adopt the theory of
the Government, alb assume that the letter of Castillero to

-SUPREME COURT.

Vallej6 is forged, and that the latter has committed perjury;
that tLe notes of entries and departures in Larkin's consular
book are also forged; that the letter of Mott, Talbot & Co., is
forged; that the letter of Larkin to Fremont, of March, 8th, as
also his letter to Captain Gillespie of April 23d, are forged; that
a number of the " Diario Oficial," purporting to be dated April
22d, has been prepareJl and procured to be printed, and a false
entry of pretended.marine intelligence from Mazatlan inserted in
it; and, finally, that Mr. Swasey, and probably Mr. Larkin's son,
have committed deliberate perjury in swearing to the genuineness of the books and papers of the deceased Consul. All this
we must assume on the faith of a single statement made by Captain Paty, of the bark Don Quixote, to the effect that "Don
Andres Castillero and his servant (Lazaro Pifla, I think, was his
nfame,) were passengers" on board his vessel, on her voyage from
Monterey, in Aprit, 1846. But, even supposing that Captain
Paty's memory is accurate, and that Lazaro Piia did not sail
in the Hannah, but remained to accompany Castillero in April,
it only proves that the latter was mistaken when he wrote to
Vallejo from Santa Clara that Pifla had embarked on the 4th of
March from Monterey. It may have happened, that in the three
days during which Larkin detained the Hannah, something
occurred to induce Castillero to countermand his orders to Piia,
and to send his letters and specimens by another hand; for, it
must be borne in mind, that proofs of the precise mode in which
a few letters and specimens of ore were sent to Mexico fourteen
years ago, cannot reasonably be exacted of the claimants. It is
surely enough if they show that a vessel sailed about the time
supposed, in which Lazaro Pifla, or any other messenger of Castillero, might have been a passenger. If the United States cc
tend that the letters and specimens were not and could not have
been received in Mexico at the time indicated in the documents
produced from that city, and therefore that those documents
are false, it is for them to establish the fact.
It is also suggested that Castillero was not in Mexico at the
time at which he is alleged to have presented himself before the
Junta de Fomento.

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

The Pvidence relied on by the United States to support this
assertion, consists of a publication in an evening paper in Mexico,
of the 6th of May, 1846, of the receipt by the Government at the
last moment before the paper went to press of important intelli.
gence from California. As this intelligence was undoubtedly
contained in the dispatches sent by the vessel which carried
Castillero, it is inferred that he could not have arrived in time
to be present on the 6th at a meeting of the Junta; and, there.
fore, that the actas are false.
That Castillero might have reached Mexico in the first dals
of May, is evident from the fact that 'he left Acapulco on the
24th of April.
As to the precise time at which the dispatches of which he
was the bearer, or which had been sent by the vessel which coa-veyed him to Acapulco, arrived in Mexico, we have no ma as
of ascertaining, except from the publication referred to.
The paper purports to have been published at three o'clock,
P. . of the 6th; as the dispatches were addressed to the Govera.
ment, and not to the newspaper, it may be assumed that th.y
were first delivered at the appropriate Ministry. What th~e
diligence or energy of Mexican journalists may be, in obtaining
the latest news, and how long an interval would probably elapse
before th.ey would possess themselves of the contents of a
Government dispatch, we are wholly uninformed. That te
news was communicated to the newspapers shortly after twelve
M. of the 6th, may be inferred from the fact that it was in print
at three, P. M. It is not surely unreasonable to suppose that the
dispatch reached the Government on the previous evening, or
early in the same morning. I see no reason why Castillero
might not, after delivering his dispatches. have presented himself to the Junta; on the same day. It appears from the minutes
of the session of the 4th, that having learned the result of the
assay, the Junta had made a reply to Castillero, asking him
what aid he required. Castillero would naturally, therefore,
have presented himself to the Junta immediately upon his
arrival; for, besides the invitation of the Junta, and his other
reasons for expediting the business, he had engaged the master

SUPREME COURT.
The United Statep vs. Andres Castillero.

of the "Don Quixote" to remain for him at Acapulco on her
return voyage. This Captain Paty testified he did. But after
waiting at Acapulco from the 21st of April to the 18th of May
he received news that Castillero would meet him at Mazatlan oi
San Blas. He touched at those places but heard nothing of
him. The circumstance, apparently unimportant, that Castillero determined to rejoin the vessel at Mazatlan, and not at
Acapulco, as originally intended, is in precise accordance with
the arrangement alleged to have been entered into by him with
the Junta, viz.: that he was to receive the sum of $5,000 in the
form of a draft on Mazatlan.
The importance 6f this incidental corroboration is perhaps not
great. It seemed, however, worthy of mention
But with regard to the inferences sought to be drawn against
the genuineness of the actas, from conjectures as to the probable
time of the arrival of the, dispatches in Mexico, it seems to me
obvious, on any hypothesis, that those dispatches must have been
delivered, and Castillero have arrived in Mexico, in time for him
to present himself before the Junta on the 6th, as their minutes
show.
From the foregoing, it appears that the evidence on the part
of the United States is insufficient, not only to disprove, but even
to raise a doubt as to the fact of the reception of Castillero's
letters and specimens, or of his own appearance before the Junta
at the dates mentioned in the actas of that body.
But it is objected that the documents produced from Mexico
are not admissible in evidence.
This objection is based on the ground that all muniments of
title are incident to the land, and pass with it as if a part of it.
That, therefore, all archives of Mexico relating to the disposition of public lands in California, were included in the treaty
and passed to the United States with the cession of the soil. It
thus became the duty of the political power to execute the treaty
with ieference to the muniments, as well as the land, and until
that is done, and the political power obtains those muniments
and presents them to the Courts, the latter cannot judicially
recognize their existence.

DECEiIBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Gastillero.
No authority directly in point has been cited in support of
this position, but a vivid picture has been drawn of the possible
evils which might result if adverse claims to the lands of the
United States were allowed to be set up, founded on alleged
public records existing in a foreign country, and proved by the
depositions and certificates of foreign officials.
It will be seen that this objection would apply, although thu
genuineness and the sufficiency of the documents to convey title
were undisputed. If a public and formal grant of a certain tract
had been made, to establish which and to show the proceedings
which led to it, evidence from the Mexican archives were necessary; if the Congress had by law conveyed a title to an individual, of which the only evidence existed in the reports of
committees and the journals of that body, the principle contended
for would require the Court to reject all such documentary evidence, no matter in what way proved or authenticated; for they
are to be rejected, not because their genuineness is doubtful, but
because they are archives and muniments of title to land.
It is admitted that, as a general rule, the right to muniments
of title passes with the land, and he who owns the latter is owner
of the evidences of his title to it.
But in the cases submitted to this Court under the Act of 185"1,
the inquiry always is, who is the owner, the United States or a
private individual?
The United: States, in consenting to be sued, .and in submitting
her rights to the determination of Courts, has abdicated, 2ro tanto,
her prerogative as a sovereign, and appears before the Court precisely as any individual who asserts an ownership in land.
To say, then, that all muniments of title belong to the United
States as owners of land, and cannot be noticed by the Courts
until commended to them by the Political Department of the
Government, is to assume the very point the suit was instituted
to determine; for the question is-does the United States own
the land? The claimant avers that she does not, and never did,
and in support of his claim he produces muniments of title
which, on the very principle contended for, belong to him and

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres (astillero.

not to the United States, for they are the muniments of title to
his own land.
I cannot perceive, therefore, that the familiar doctrine of the
common law, which regards title deeds as incident to the land
and as passing with it, has any application.
In the argument submitted by the counsel for the United
States, the distinction seems to have been lost sight of between
the political rights of the United States as a sovereign and her
purely proprietary rights as an alleged owner of land, which are
alone passed upon in this class of cases.
In defining the boundaries of the Territorial Sovereignty of
the United States; in determining whether a particular tract is
within the limits of a territory the sovereignty of which has been
ceded by treaty to the United States, the Courts must alwa ra
adopt the construction given to the treaty by the Political De.
partment (,Elam vs. Neilson, 11 Peters R. 282). But when th G
United States consent to appear merely as a suitor in the Coui~s
and to litigate her rights with an adverse private claimant, tie
rights of both must be determined by the application of the or lnary rules which prevail in actions between private individuals.
'It is remarked by the counsel for the United States: "If tf-.e
Judiciary were authorized to say what land was intended to )
transferred, and what papers as muniments of title and incideni-d
to the land, it might designate land and accredit papers whi',h
the Political Department did not, and thus conflict might arise
rithin the Government itself."
But this is precisely what the highest authority of the nation
nas, by the law of 1851, enjoined upon the Courts to do. The
very object of that law was, that the Courts should ascertain
what lands passed to the United States by the Treaty, and what
lands were private and did not pass. The question, by that law,
was converted from a political to a judicial one, and no conflict
could possibly arise, for the political and all other departments
are by law required to be governed by the decision of the Court,
which determines what is public land belonging to the United
States, and what is private land belonging to individuals.
There is something repugnant to reason and justice in the

DECEMBER TERM. 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
idea that the United States, after consenting to appear as an
ordinary litigant before the Courts, and submhit her proprietary
rights to their determination, should suddenly, in the midst of
the suit, throw off her character as a mere party to a suit
respecting the ownership of land, or rather, without ceasing to
be such, should resume and assert her sovereign rights, and
announce to her antagonist that evidences of title he offers,
though genuine and conclusive, shall not be admitted by the
Court unless presented to it through and by herself; while, at
the same time, she refuses to obtain them from the foreign
government, or to receive them, if offered, or to present them to
the Court, if received.
Compared with such manifest injustice, the evils which might
result from possible impositions practiced on the Courts by
means of forged archives, &c., are insignificant.'
I think the general objection to the admissibility of the doc.
ments, because they are Mexican archives, not recognized i.s
such by the Political Department of the United States Goveni.
me~it, cannot be maintained.
Assuming, then, the documents from the archives of Mexico
to be genuine and admissible, I proceed to consider their .legal
effect:
1. As to the alleged ratification of acts of the Alcalde Pico.
This ratification is supposed, by the claimants, to be contained
in the dispatchi of Becerra to the Junta, of May, 20, 1846, and in
the marginal "acuerdo" on the letter of Vicente Segura, signed
with the rubric of the same Minister.
The dispatch of Becerra announces, as we have seen, to the
Junta, that "His Excellency [i. e. the President] has been pleased
to approve, in all its parts, the agreement made with that individual [viz., Castillero] in order to commence the working of
said mine."
The "acuerdo"-on the margin of Segura's communic'ation is
as follows :"' Granted, in the terms which are proposed, and with
respect to the land, let the corresponding order issue to the
Minister of Relations for the proper measures of his office, wit'h
VOL. 11.
21

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
the understanding that the Supreme Government accedes to the
petition."
An "acuerdo," or order on the margin of a letter, petition, or
communication of any kind, is merely an expression of the
determination of the Miniser or other functionary to whom it is
addressed, in regard to its subject-matter. Its chief use was to
direct the clerks or other subordinates in the preparation of the
-eply, or in taking other action with regard to it. If the proceedings has been interrupted after the "acuerdo" is affixed,
but before the dispatch is written or title issued as directed, it
may be regarded, not unreasonably, as a species of equitable
title, or as sufficient, coupled with other equitable circumstances,
to justify the party in asking the completion of the proceeding
so initiated. But when the title has issued, or the dispatch been
written in pursuance of the "acuerdo," when the latter has been
submitted to the Minister, and approved and signed by him, the
dispatch so approved and signed is the highest and best evidence,
not only of the action of the Government in the premises, but
of the true intention of the "acuerdo ;" for, surely, no argument
is necessary to prove that an official reply) signed by a public
officer, is better evidence of his resolution, with regard to a
particular application, than a direction to his subordinates as to
the form in which the reply is to be drafted.
Dismissing, then. the "acuerdo," or rather treating it as intend.
ing precisely what the dispatch, prepared in obedience to it,
expresses, let us consider the true import and effect of the
latter.
It will be observed that the dispatch of Becerra does not, in
terms, profess to ratify any mining possession or grant, either
of lands or of pertenencias. Nor does it announce that the
President has been pleased to make such ratification. It merely
informs the Junta that His Excellency has approved an agree.
ment made by the Junta with Castillero.
It is not pretended that any such agreement was, at that time,
or afterwards, formally entered into between the parties. The
propositions of Castillero are dated May 12th. The communication of the Junta is dated May 14th, and Castillero himself, in

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The Uni ed Steles vs. Andres Castilera.
the preamble to the statement of his propositions, expresses his
persuasion that the Junta will accede to his request "so far as
maybe within its powers, and that it will send up to the Supreme
Government with a recommendation that which may require the
decision of the latter."
.'From the communication of the Junta it is evident that the
authorization of the Supreme Government was necessary toenable it to furnish Castillero with the iron retorts and flasks belonging to it, as also to make him the loan he solicited.pf $5,000,
payable in quicksilver at $100 per quintal, and without the
five per cent. premium per annum which the law required it to
exact.
Until the approval of the Supreme Government .of this pro:
posed arrangement could be had, no formal contract could be
entered into. It was, therefore, not until May 25th, and after the
receipt of Becerra's communication approving the proposed contract, that the Junta resolved "that the proper judicial agreement
be drawn up immediately, and that application be made for the
draft for the $5,000 on Mazatlan or Guadalajara," as appears by
the actas of that day.
That the agreement was never so drawn up and executed is
admitted; and on the 29th of May an order was made for the
payment of the lotary Calapiz "for proceedings relative to it,"
its cofisummation having been prevented by the order suspending all payments out of the quicksilver fund.
The language- of the dispatch is, therefore, evidently inaccurate
in speaking of the approval of the agreement made or "conven i o
ceZebrado" with Castillero. Its evident intention was.t6 signify
the approval by the Government of the agreement proposed to
be made, and which the Junta had expressed its willingness and
even anxiety to enter into.
What the agreement was, which, after the approval of the
Government had been obtained, the Junta and Castillero had
fixed upon and -nearly consummated by a formal act before a
Notary, we learn from the Report of the Junta of Novemer
17th, 1846, produced by Seffor de Bassoco, and embodied in
Ur. Laftagua's report in December of the same year.

SUPREME COURT.
The United Stoles vs. Andres Castillero.
In this report, the Junta, after giving an account of the pre
sentation of cinnabar ore, &c., by Seffor del Moral, of its assay,
and of their inquiry of Castillero what aid he required, proceeds
as follows:
"The Seffor presented his petition in due form and it having
been very attentively examined by the Junta, he made his
propositions, to which this Junta agreed, to wit: That there
should be delivered to him $5,000 in money, eight iron retorts of
those which the Junta ordered to be made for the examinations
previously'made, and all the quicksilver flasks it had in the nego
tiation of Tasco; Senor Castillero obligating himself, on his part
to repay said advance in quicksilver at tte rate of $100 pey
quintal, within six months from his leaving the port of Mazatlan.
This agreement was approved by the Supreme Government on
the 20th of the same month; but on account of the declaration
of blockade made by the United States of the North, when he
was about to receive the draft on Mazatlan, the Ministry issued
the order of September 19th of this year, directing the suspension of all payments of the branch of quicksilver, except those
for the support of the College and the expenses of the office."
In this account of the cause, and the date of the abandonment
of the agreement with Castillero, the Junta are evidently inac
curate; for their own actas show that the communication informing them of the blockade of Vera Cruz and Tampico, and
directing the suspension of all payments for the extraction of
quicksilver, was dated on the 27th of May, and received by the
Junta on the 28th; and on the 29th, the Notary Calapiz was
paid for his proceedings in relation to the intended contract.
The communication of the 19th of September ordered that the
assets of the quicksilver fund should continue to be used merely
for the su2port of the College, and it demanded a loan of $25,000
from the Dotal Fund. This was strenuously opposed by some
of the members, on the ground that the Dotal Fund was the
private property of the creditors of that fund. As these discus.
sions occurred less than two months previous to the date of the
report of the Junta, and were no doubt fresh in its recollection,
and as the report was prepared in great haste, only eight days

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
being allowed for the purpose, the Junta fell into the error of
ascribing the breaking off of the negotiation with Castillero to
the order of September 19th, instead of to that of the 28th of May.
Lift with respect to the agreement made with Castillero, and
approved by the Supreme Government, the report is very ex
plicit. It sets forth the terms of that contract with a clearness
which leaves no room for -doubt as to what it was that the
Supreme Government approved.
The agreement .thus entered into embraced all the subjects
upon which the Junta had authority to act. l or can it be said
that the approval of the Supreme Government was only required
as to tho se propositions of Castillero which related to the ratification of his mining possession and a grant of two leagues, for"
we learn from the letter of the Junta that that body had no
authority, without the approval of the Government, either to
sell the ret irts and flasks desired by Castillero, or to lend him
a large suin without interest, to be repaid in quicksilver. But
-%
ith the granting of lands, the Junta -had nothing to do, and
viliatever might have been the resolution of the Government on
(:astillero's stventh and eighth propositions, it would never have
been commuL teated to the Junta in the form of an approval of
a i agreement into which they were supposed to have already
eatered.
Some stress has been laid on the use of the word "concedido,"
or "granted," in the marginal "acuerdo" of Becerra.
Had this word appeared alone, and been written on the margin of Castillero's petition, it might, perhaps, have been considered evidence that the whole, prayer of the petition had been
gianted. But it is written on the margin of the Junta's letter,
and clearly imports that its request was granted, viz., that the
proposed agreement was approved, as is unequivocally shown
by the 'official dispatch written on the same day, and in pursuance of the marginal order of the Minister.
We shall presently see that the petition of Castillero was for
land, and not for additional mining pertenencias.
The acuerdo therefore adds:"With respect to the land, let the corresponding order issue

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
to the Minister of Relations, for the proper measures of his
office with the understanding that the Supreme Government
accedes to the petition."
The corresponding order did issue-we have it in Becerra's
dispatch to the Minister of Justice. The proper measures were
taken in his office-we have them in his dispatch to the Governor of California: and from it alone can we learn what was
done by the Government "with respect to the land" petitioned
for by Castillerc
It has already been stated that the Act of Possession of the
Alcalde Pico embraced two distinct objects: first, the judicial
possession of a mine, with the number of pertenencias allowed
by law-but, how many, both the Alcalde and the parties seem
to have been uncertain; secondly, a grant of a tract of land extending three thousand varas in every direction, as a "gracia"
or gift to Castillero. The distinction between these two acts of
the Alcalde is not only admitted but strenuously insisted on by
the counsel for claimant, and it was contended that the first was
legal aid valid, while the second is conceded to be utterly nugr tory and void.
When, therefore, Castillero asked that the Junta would recommend the approval by the Supreme Gov-crnment of the
possession which had been given 7im of the mine, in the same
terms as those in which he then held it, he must have intended
to ask either for a ratification of the possession of the mine, or
for an approval of the grant of three thousand varas of land,
or for both.
That he did not ask for three thousand varas to be given him
as additional pertenencias, is admitted by one of the able and
eminent counsel who argued the cause for the claimant.
Tu the printed report of his argument, he is asked by Mr
Randolph, of counsel for United States:
You argue, then, that the Junta, misunderstanding this doca
iaent of Castillero's, supposed it to be for additional peTtenencias
and as such recommended its confirmation.
Mr. Benjamin.-" Certainly."
But this
was not the only error into which the Junta fell; fo7
I

The United States vs. Andres Caslillero.

they not only supposed that Castillero was seeking additional
mining pertenencias, and merely a tract of land for his hacienda,
&c., as well as two square leagues to supply wood for his burnings,
but they supposed the three thousand varas so desired, would
only amount to fifteen pertenencias, whereas they would amount
to nine hundred. The Junta evidently supposed that Castillero
solicited a tract three thousand varas long, and of the width of
one pertenencia. As a pertenencia is two hundred varas in
length, a tract three thousand varas long would comprise exactly
fifteen pertenencias. They overlooked the fact that the tract
was to be three thousand varas "in every direction," or six thousand varas square, making nine hundred pertenencias. If then, the Supreme Government had formally and unequiv:
ocally signified its assent to this recommendation of the Junta,
and ratified the possession as represented by them, it nay well
be doubtdd whether in a Court of Equity it could be deemed to
have ratified any more than a possession of fifteen pertenencias,
which was all that Castillero, speaking through the Junta,
denianded.
But the fact, that the Junta thought it necessary to devote so
much time, and to suggest so many arguments, to induce the
Supreme Government to ratify'a supposed mining possession of
fifteen pertenencias, justifies the supposition that had. they known
it to have comprised nine hundred pertenencias, they would
probably have withheld their recommendation.
That both the Junta and the Supreme Government. were
willing to assist the enterprise of Castillero by every means in
their power, is evident. Their object in so doing, was not to
confer a favor on Castillero personally, but to promote the pro.
duction of quicksilver in the largest quantities, and at the
cheapest rates possible.
The same policy would have forbidden them to give a single
miner nine hundred mines, of bne. pertenencia each, and thereby
to exclude rom so large a tra t all miners who might otherwise
have discovered and developed new mines in the vicinity, and
increased the production and diminished the price of the metal
the Government was so anxious to obtain.

SUPREME

COURT.

The United Stales vs. Andres Castillero.
It has appeared to me that the very considerations urged by
the counsel of the claimant with regard to the-policj and i1iterest
of Mexico in promoting the production of quicksilver render i1
impossible that it could, consistently with that policy, have
consented to a monopoly by a single miner of a mining tract of
such enormous dimensions.
It is clear, therefore, that the Supreme Government could not
have intended to ratify the possession of the three thousand
varas as mining pertenencias.
But we have already seen that the approval by the Government of the agreement made by the Junta, is conclusively shown
not to import a ratification or grant of any pertenencias or lands
whatsoever; for the terms of the agreement so approved are
3isclosed to us by the Junta itself, and can be ascertained as
exactly as if the formal instrument had been executed by the
parties, th- approval of the Government appended to it, and
were now before us.
It does not appear that the Act of Possession of Pico was ever
exhibited either to the Junta or the Supreme Government. If
it had been, it would have disclosed the fact that the mine had
been denounced and possession of it given, as on the lands of
Jos6 Reyes Berreyesa. It would also have been seen that the
Alcalde had assumed to grant a tract three thousand varas in
every direction from the mouth of the mine, which must have
included a large portion of the land of a private individual, even
3upposing that the mine itself might not have been within his
limits. Adopting the obvious construction of the Act of Possession contended for by the claimants, and regarding that act,
and the ratification asked for by Castillero, as referring to a
tract of land and not to additional pertenencias, and assuming
with the distinguished counsel for the claimants, that the Junta
was mistaken in supposing that any number of additional pertenericias, whether fifteen or nine hundred, were asked for, we may
well doubt whether the Supreme Government, if informed that
this tract would in great part include private property, would
have so readily made the grant. We have no reason to suppose
tha, as between individuals at least, rights of property are not

as scrupulously respected and enforced by the Mexican as by
other nations.
Again, it is contended that in addition to the grant of three
thousand varas in every direction, made by the Alcalde and
approved by the Supreme Government, there were also granted
to Castillero two square leagues of land, to be measured in like
manner from the mouth of the mine.
The mode adopted and the precautions observed by the
Supreme Government in signifying its willingness that such a
grant should be made, will hereafter be adverted to.
Our only concern with it at present is to observe, that on the
claimant's theory, the Supreme Government first ratified a con.
cession of six thousand varas square, or more than a league and
a quarter in extent, and then issued orders for a further grant
of identically the same land, with three-quarters of a league in
addition. Its resolution with regard to the latter is formally
and regularly communicated to the Governor of California, who
was directed to take the proper steps to carry out the intention
of the Government; while with regard to the former, its determination is supposed to be expressed in a declaration that it
approves a contract, the terms of which we know, and which
has no reference, nor could it have had, to grants of land; and
the approval of which, if it could by possibility be construed to
mean an approval of all Castillero's propositions would import
a grant of the two sitios, as clearly as it would import a ratification of the concession of the six thousand varas square.
But the dispatch of Becerra to the Minister of Relations
informs us to what part of Castillero's petition the President
thought proper to accede, in language too explicit to be misunderstood.
After transcribing his letter to the Junta, Becerra says: "And
I have the honor to transcribe it to your Excellency, to the end
that with respect to the petition of Senor Castillero, to which his
Excellency the President ad interim has thought proper to accede,
that there be granted to him two square leagues as a colonist,"
&..
It is insisted by the counsel for the claimants, that the words

SUPREME COURT.
The tnited States vs. Andres Castillero.
"that there be granted to him two square leagues as a coloni ,"are
descriptive of the petition of Castillero to which the President
acceded. The observation is just. - Such is no doubt the true
construction of the dispatch, and it establishes beyond doubt,
that in acceding to the petition the President meant only to
accede to that part of it which asked for a grant of two leagues
as a colonist, without expressing any resolution as to the application for a. ratification of the concession of three thousand
varas.
As, then, the supposed ratification is not contained in the
approval of the contract of the Junta, nor in the acceding by
the President to the petition for two leagues in colonization, it
must be found, if at all, in the word "concedido" or "granted"
in the acuerdo. But for the reasons given above, I am satisfied
that no such signification can be attached to that word in the
face of the dispatches written in pursuance of the acuerdo, and
which embody and explain its meaning.
But if any doubt could remain as to the true intention and
effect of the approval of the Junta's contract, it would be dissipated by the evidence afforded by the acts of the parties, of the
construction placed upon it b3 themselves.
Throughout the whole negotiation for the purchase of barras
or shares in the mine, conducted by Mr. Negrete on behalf of
Mr. Forbes with Castillero in person, the latter, though urged to
exhibit his documents of title, produces only the dispatch of
Castillo Lanzas for two leagues. In the instrument of ratifica
tion the mine is spoken of as of three pertenencias in extent,
and Castillero "cedes in favor of the contractors of supply
(aviadores), and for the sixteen years of his contract, the Ewa
square leagues of land of which the Government has made him
a concession, as shown by the official document which he pre
sents, that it may be inserted at the end of the present instru.
ment."

The Lanzas dispatch is accordingly copied in the instrument,
but not the slightest allusion is made to any other grant of three
thousand varas in every direction made by an Alcalde, and
approved by the Supreme Government.

DEOEIMBER TERM, 1862.

881

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
In all the tausactions between the parties, the idea is but once
suggested, that the approval of the Junta's contract with Castil.
lero imported a ratification of the Alcalde's concession of thiee
thousand varas.
It occurs in Alexander Forbes' letter to James Alexander
Forbes of February 3, 1850. In that letter Mr. Forbes says:
"We think at present it may be the best plan to get an authen
ticated copy of the approval by the Mexican Government of the
three thousand varas given by the Alcalde on giving possession
of the mine. As a doubt may be started as to whether the
Alcalde, acting as the Juez de Mineria, had a right to make this
grant, yet, if approved by the Mexican Government. before the
possession of the country by the Americans, there could be no
doubt on the subject. This takes in our hacienda, and uness
opposed by the Berreyesas,would, I should think, settle the question. Castillero says such an approval was given, and that on his
arrival in Mexico he will procure a judicial copy of it. This is
the plan we shall adopt, if we hear nothing from you to alter this
resolution.
"Since writing the foregoing, I have looked over your private
letter to William Forbes, dated 18th October, in which you state
the limits or boundiries as follows: 'The boundaries must be
expressed as joining on the north and northwest by land- of the
ranchos de San Vic'nto and de los Capitancillos, and the east,
south and west, by Serrania or Tierras baldias'
"Castillero is not certain of accomplishing this latter plan, but
thinks the first, that is the three thousand varas, the best."
It will be observed that this letter unmistakably discloses the
"plan," which James Alexander Forbes had suggested, and Alexander Forbes adopted, of obtaining fraudulent and antedated
documents from Mexico expressing the boundaries of the two
sitios, &c. No reliance can therefore be placed on the statement
that Castillero said the approval was given.
But whatever he may have told Mr. Forbes, the approval and
the agreement approved are before us, and we have already
seen that they contain no allusion to any concession of land by
an Alcalde.

SUPREME

COURT

The United Stales vs. Andres Castillero.
The silence of Castillerio during his 'negotiations with Mr.
Negrete, is far more significant than any statement made four
years afterward to Mr. Forbes, nor dan ite said that at the time
of those negotiations he was ignorant of the action of Government; for the Castillo Lanzas dispatch, then in his possession,
and inserted at the end of the contract of ratification, recites the
Becerra dispatch, which contains the approval of the contract.
the parties were in Mexico; the public offices were accessible,
and it would have been easy to ascertain what was the contract
approved. That Castillero knew what that contraet was cannot
be doubted; and yet he and all the other parties, through a
series of years, treat the dispatch as a concession of two leagues,
but never suspect itto contain evidence of, or to be in itself, a
ratification of the Alcalde's gracia, or gratification. Even so
late as the date of Mr. Halleck's affidavit, James Alexander
Forbes, with the notarial cppy of the Lanzas dispatch in his possession, never seems to have imagined that the dispatch of
Becerra inserted in it, and announcing the approval -of the
Junta's contract, constituted the ratification he so much desired
of the Alcalde's grant of three thousand varas.
I think it clear, therefore, that the dispatch of Becerra cannot
be construed to import a ratification of the action of the AIcalde,
either in respect to the- possession of the mine, or to the grant
by him of three thousand varas.
As to the alleged grant of two leagues. It cannot be denied,
that if the documents produced by the claimants be genuine,
they show that Castillero presented a petition for two square
leagues of land; that this petition was by the Junta de Fomento
submitted to the Supreme Government; that the Junta was
formally apprised by the Minister of Justice that the proper
communication had been sent to the Minister of Relations, that
suitable orders might be issued by him with respect to that part
of Castillero's petition; that a communication was accordingly
sent to that Minister, informing him that the President had
acceded to Castillero's petition. and requiring him to issue the
corresponding orders; aLd that the Minister of Relations, in purv.an-e of these instructions,- transcribed the communication to

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Gastillero.
the Governor of California, in order that in conformity - th
what the laws and dispositions on colonization provided, be
might put Seffor Castillero in possession of the said two leagues.
It is manifest that this dispatch of Castillo Lanzas does not by
its terms grant the land solicited. It contains no words trans.
lative of title; it is not addressed to the supposed grantee, but
to the Governor of California7; it cannot have been intended to
serve as a muniment of title to Castillero, for otherwise it would
have contained formal words sufficient to vest the estate in him..
It- is merely an official communication addressed by one executive officer to another, which, for aught that appears, might as
well have been sent to the Governor of California by a courier
as by the hands of Castillero. It contains, however, an unequivocal official declaration that the President of the Republic
had thought proper to accede to Castillero's petition, and an
order to put him in possession conformably to the laws on
colonization.
The case thus resembles in some respects that of United Statei
vs. Lecompte, (11 How. 124,) where the claimant had obtained an
order from the Lieutenant-Governor directing the Procurador
del Comun to put him in possession, if in so doing no prejudice
would result to third persons.
The petition solicited two leagues at the place called Llanacoco, to be located so as to include the entire prairie of that
name. The Supreme Court held that the order of the LieutenantGovernor could not be construed to signify an absolute unconditional grant of any specific land; and, as it was never presented to the Procurador, and the land had never been severed
from the public domain by that officer, and no occupation was
shown which could supply the deficiency by giving certainty
and definiteness to the claim, it was rejected.
If the reasoning of the Supreme Court be attentively considered,.it will be seen that they refused to treat the order of
the Lieutenant-Governor as an absolute grant, for two reasons:
1st. Because it directed the petitioner to be put in possession,
"if in so doing no prejudice could result to third persons," and
the matter was referred to an officer, to whom the duty was

SUPREME

COURT.

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

of ascertaining the means, &c., of the petitioner and
"judging of the propriety of the grant." And 2d. Because the
land was not severed from the public domain by the description
in the concession, or by authorized survey, or by any definite
occupation.
. It may, I think, be inferred from the whole opinion, that if the
concession had described any tract which could be identified.
and the petitioner had occupied it, the claim would have been
confirmed, notwithstanding the omission to present the order to
the Procurador. In the case at bar, the Governor is ordered to put
-onfided

the petitioner in possession "in conformity with what is prescribe.
in the laws and dispositions on colonization."

The 2d article of the law of 1824,. declares that "those lands
of the nation,. which are not the property of any individual,
corporation or town, are the subject of this law, and may be
colonized."
The first step to be taken by the Governor, in execution of
the order, would have been to ascertain whether the land was
within the colonization law-that is, whether it was the land of
the nation, or belonged to any private individual; precisely as
the Procurador was to ascertain whether by putting the pet[.
tioner in possession, any injury would result to third parties.
To construe this dispatch as an absolute grant of a specifie
tract, we must suppose Castillero to have practiced on the Government a gross fraud, either by concealing or misstating the
facts. For, even admitting that he had reason to believe that
the mine itself was not within the limits of Berreyesa, he must
have known that a tract of two 'leagues measured in all direc.
tons from the mouth of the mine, would certainly have included
e portion of his land.
The counsel for the claimants, feeling, no doubt, the force of
tIs objection, suggested that it was intended that inquiry should
be made by the Governor, and the two leagues were to be located
in such a way as not to include private land. But this admis
sion proves that the duties to be performed by the Governor
were exactly those assigned to the Procurador del Comun, in

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

835

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

the case referred to; and if the order to put in possession was
not a grant in that case, neither can it be so considered in this.
The case at bar is, in some respects, stronger than that reported;
for here, the order was addressed to the Executive of a Depart.
ment to whom, by the laws, in conformity to which the order
was to be executed, it belonged to issue the formal title for the
.land, while the functions of the Procurador were merely to
inquire into and report the circumstances of the r etitioner, and
to mark off and sever from the public domain the land granted.
Had the Governor and Departmental Assembly, in ignorance
of the application of Castillero, and -the action of the Supreme
Government upon it, regularly granted the same land to another
person, in strict conformity with the colonization laws, I cannot
doubt that his title, though subsequent in date to the dispatch
of Lanzas, would have prevailed; and on the reception of that
dispatch the Governor would either have refrained from executing it at all, or would, more probably, have allowed Castillero
to take his two leagues out of the nearest body of ungranted
land.
In the very ingenious brief filed by the counsel foir the United
States, it is observed:
"The theory of government for the Mexican Territories or
Departments was, that all the powers of government were exercised immediately by the local Political Chief or Governor,
through whom the will of the Supreme Central Authority at the
City of Mexico was transmitted, and by the action of which
functionary, and not otherwise, it became operative on persons
and things. It was a government of governments-the plan
which Spain established in the beginning for the government of
the Indies, and which Mexico continued to this extent without
a change. Its model was the organization of an army. It was
the same whether the Sovereign's will was expressed in the forn
of a general law, or some particular disposition like a grant; all
were alike instructions to an inferior officer. They were not
binding on him until known, nor effective until obeyed-until
he had done or suffered another to do that which was required.
"The Local Representative of the Natiornal Sovereignty was

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres (astillero.
invested with all the active powers of Government in this Department. He alone could manifest the grantor's will, and from
Mexico no more could, come than the impulse which should
move him to act. In these titles, nothing was done here, even
the mining title being an original grant in Mexico. The Local
Representative has never acted, and therefore there has been no
expression of the grantor's will."
In this lucid exposition of the general theory on which the
vast governmental machinery of the ancient Spanish Monarchy,
and measurably that of Mexico, were constructed, I entirelj
concur. But if it be argued that because the will of the Sover
eign was ordinarily communicated to and executed by subordi
nate agents, he had no power himself directly to act upon person.
and things without intervention of the local authority, I cannot
assent to the conclusion; for th will of an absolute Sovereign

and. seal, a grant to a subjec& in a remote province, I eannot
9uppose that the royal patent in the subject's hands would not
have been respebted by the subordinate authorities, notwith
standing that the title had been transferred, and the grant con
summated without their intervention.
Nor is it certain that the order of the Sovereign to a subor.
dinate to make a grant to a subject, or do any other act in the
performance in which he is interested, is a mere nullity, until
known to and obeyed- by the inferior officer.
If,as is admitted, the impulse which moves the subordinate
to act, rightfully proceeds from the central authority-if the
subordinate has no discretion in the premises, but must obey,
and his duties are purely ministerial and executive, it would
seem that the sovereign disposition which required him to aot,
cannot be regarded as a mere nullity, even though never in fact
obeyed.
Such, I understand to have been the ruling of the Supreme
Court in a recent case, where an order to the Governor that a
particular island should be assigned to an individual was held
itself "to adjudicate the title;" the formal issuing of the title-

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

papers being a merely ministerial act to be performed by the
Gdvrnor.
It is true, that, in that case, the order was received and obeyed
and the title issued. But, the language of the Supreme Court is
explicit, that the dispatch "operated of itself to adjudicate the
title to the claimants." This case will be more fully considered
hereafter.
But whether a notice of the superior will must have been given
t) the local representative of the Government, and that will. must
have been obeyed before it could affect the rights of persons, or
the. condition of things; or whether, as seems to be considered
by the Supreme Court, the sovereign disposition, though unknown to, and unobeyed by, the local authority, had an imme.
diate and independent operation, it is clear that by the miinforrpractice of the Spanish and Mexican Governments, the dispos;
tions of the sovereign authority ilways contemplated the instri
mentality of the local subordinate.
If, therefore, in this case the Government had known that tl e
tract solicited was public land, and that no objection whatev, x
existed to making the grant, it would have been a signal depa r.
ture from its ancient and established practice to issue the grant
directly to the applicant.
In treating, then, this dispatch as an,,order to make a gran t,
we suppose the Government to have conformed to its immemorial and traditional usages. *While to consider the- dispatch as
itself conveying the title, and confining mierely an order to the
Governor to put the claimant it possession of land already
granted to him by the direct act of the Supreme Government,
is to suppose the latter to have adopted an -exceptional mode of
proceeding, inconsistent with that pursued in the island's case,
and with the theory on which the whole system of government
was organized.
For these reasons I cannot regard the dispatch of Lanzas as a
direct grant of the two leagues referred to.
Taking this view of the dispatch, we cannot account for the
very explicit declarations of the Mexican Commissioners, that
22
VOL. 1:1.

SUPREME COIET.
The United S&es vs. Andres Casillero.
no grants had been made of land in California subsequent to
May 13, 1846.
For, even if their researches had extended to the official correspondence of Ministers of Relations who had held office from
the date of the declaration, and they had discovered the dispatch
of Lanzas, they regarded it but as an order to the Governor to
make a grant, which they knew could never have been acted on.
The truth of their declarations, therefore, to the American Commissioner, is thus entirely consistent with the genuineness of the
documents, while, if the dispatch be considered to import an
absolute and present grant, we are driven to choose between
two alternatives-one, that the Commissioners were guilty of a
deliberate falsehood-the other, that the dispatch itself is a
forgery.
But the dispatch, though not itself a grant, is, nevertheless,
evidence that the Supreme Government -acceded to Castillero's
petition; and it is, at least, an order that a grant should be
made to him by the Government of California, in conformity
with the colonization laws, i. e. if the land were vacant and no
other insuperable objection existed.
Giving- then this construction to the dispatch, let us consider
its legal effect-and here we. re fortunately not without authority to guide us.
In the case of Andres Castillero vs. The Uitel States, for the
Island of Santa Cruz (23 How. 464), the claimant relied on a
dispatch of the Minister of Interior, in many respects resembling
that of Castillo Lanzas.
In that dispatch the Minister informs the Governor, that in
consideration of the services and merits of Castillero, the President directs him (the Minister) "to recommend Castillero very

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
It will be noticed that the terms of this dispatch are not in
some respects so strong as those of the dispatch of Lanzas.
It is not said that the President has acceded to a petition
for any particular island or tract of land. Castillero is merely
"recommended very efficaciously to the Governoi and Depart
mental Junta," and this recommendation is made in order that
there be "assigned" to him the island he may select, &c.; contemplating, evidently the execution and delivery by the Governor of the formal title for the island so selected. In the
Lanzas dispatch, the President's assent to the petition is communicated to the Governor, "in order that he may put Castillero in
possession of the land "-an expression which has afforded room
for the construction that no further title-paper was designed to
be issued.
In the Santa Cruz Island case, the Supreme Court held that
"the dispatch of the Government operated to adjudicate the
tiltle." Its language is:
"They (the Governor and the Junta) were accordingly directed
not to proceed to make adjudications under the previous order
until the assignment of the title to this claimant was perfected,
but they were not required to ma7e the assignment or to cause it
to be made.
"To accomplish that purpose, and to carry into effect the
command of the President, two things only were necessary"to
be done; one was to be performed by the claimant, and the
other was a ministerial act. It was the claimant who was to
make the selection, and if it was a proper one, near the place where
he was stationed with his troops, nothing remained but to make
the assignment as described in the dispatch. Emanating as the
dispatch did from the supreme power of the nation, it operated
of itself to adjudicate the title to the claimant, leaving no discretion
to be exercised by the authorities of the Department. Neither the
Governor nor the Assembly nor both combined, could withhold
the grant after a proper selection, without disobeying the express command of the Supreme Government. Nothing therefore,
remained to be done, but f) issue the title-papers, and that was

the 1)roper duty of the Governor as the Executive -organ of the
Department.
This language would seem too clear for misconstruction. It
seems to me an express decision, that an order of the Supreme
Government directing the Governor of a Department to make a
grant, operates to adjudicate the title to the land specified. It
could not, however, have been meant that the order itself was
an absolute grant; for it was evident that the formal grant
was to be made by the Governor, and besides it did not refer to
any particular island, but to such island as Castillero might
select; and it was only after the selection was made and found
to be a proper one,. that the title Attached to any particular piece
of land.
If such were the effect of the order of Pesada, I am unable to
perceive why the Castillo Lanzas dispatch must not be con.
sidered to have had a like operation. The direction in that
dispatch to the Governor to put Castillero in possession in conformity with the laws and dispositions on colonization, confided
no more discretion to him than the duty of seeing that the islan 3
selected was a proper one, confided to the Governor in the case
before the Supreme Court; ard if the issuing of the title-papers
in that case was a "merely min-sterial act," to be done in respect
of land, the title of which had already been adjudicated to the
claimant, the same view must be taken of the action, which con
struing the Lanzas dispatch least favorably for the claimants,
Governor Pico was in this case ordered to take.
It is contended that the President 6f Mexico had no authority
to make the order for a grant contained in the Lanzas dispatch.
But, 1st. It is apparent, both from the action of the Supreme
Government in this case, as well as in that of the islands on the
coast, that it exercised the power.
The presumption, therefore, arises, that it nad the authority it
exercised. "The public acts of public officers purporting to be
exercised in an official capacity, and by public authority, are
not to be presumed to be usurped, but a legitimate authority
previously given, or subsequently ratified, which is equivalent."

2. 1he Colonization Law of 1824, while it enjoined upon the
States of the Confederation the duty of making laws or regula
tions for colonizing within their respective limits, committed the
whole subject of colonization in the Territories to the Supreme
Executive.
The 16th article of that law provides, that 'the Executive
shall proceed in conformity with the principles established to
the colonization of the Territories."
In pursuance of this authority the Supreme Executive, in
1828, framed the regulations which prescribed the mode in which
the colonization of the Territories should be effected.
It was from the dispositions thus made by the Supreme Executive, that the Governor and Junta in the Territory of Califriula derived all their powers with respect to the granting of
land.Had the President seen fit to confide the authority to grant,
either to the Governor alone, to the Prefects of the Partidas, or
to local Commiseioners, he might have done so, or he might
have retained it exclusively to himself.
The regulations, in fact, provided that concessions made by
the Governor should not be definitely valid unless approved by
the Departmental Assembly; and, in case its approval was not.
obtained, the Governor was to report to the Supreme Government for its decision.
Grants made to "empresarios" were, by the 7th regulation,
not to be held as definitely valid until the approval of the Supreme Government was obtained.
It thus appears, not only that the authority of the Governors
with respect to colonization was not immediately conferred by
any law-of Congress, and owed its existence to discretionary
regulations of the Supreme Executive, but that by those very
regulations the Executive reserved to itself an important part
of the granting power. After the adoption of the Central System, and the division of the whole Republic into Departments,
the right to dispose 'of all the lands belonging to the nation
seems to have been confided to the Supreme Executive. The
Lam of 1837 gave to the President authority to sell or pledge

them, and by his decree of 11th of March, 1842, other important
and 'fundamental changes in the colonization laws with regard
to foreigners were made by General Santa Anna.
It is said by making a grant directly to an individual, or in
directing the Governor of a Department to make one, the Presideni violated an existing law, which even an absolute monarch
cannot do; for he may abrogate or modify the law, yet while it
remains unrepealed he cannot violate it.
The general principle is admitted, but its application to this
case is not perceived.
That the President, by the law of 1824, could have reserved
to himself the whole right of making grants in the Territories,
has already been shown. Such a disposition, though not in
accordance with the ordinary policy of the Spanish and Mexican
Governments, which intrusted the administration of local affaiis
to local subordinates by whom the orders of the Supreme Government were carried into effect, would, nevertheless, have been
legal and within the limits of the discretion confided to the Executive by the law of 1824.
This power he still retained, notwithstanding that he bad
framed general regulations on the subject for the guidance of the
Governments of the Territories; for those regulations were the
mere creature of the President, and could not deprive him or
his successors of the general powers given him by law, or of the
right to act directly in special cases by making the grant himself, or by ordering the Governor to do so.
The Governor of a Department had no power to grant lands
by virtue of his office, or conferred on him as such by law.
All his authority to grant was derived from the regulations
of the Executive, of whom he was but the agent and the instrument. He was at all times subject to Executive instructions, and
the President might at his discretion withdraw any lands from
colonization, prescribe new qualifications for grantees, or in any
other manner modify the Governor's authority with respect to
grants, or direct him as to its exercise.
That he did so interpose with regard to certain Mission lands
which the Governor and Assembly were about to grant is well]

known, and this Court has decided grants in violation of the
order of the Executive to be invalid. The islands cases and
the case at bar furnish additional instances of the exercise of the
same power.
I .confess myself unable to understand how a grant by the
President, still less an order to his local subordinate to make a
grant, can be deemed such a violation of the law as no absolute
monarch could commit, or indeed any violation of law whatso
ever.
3d. The question is decided by the Supreme Court in the case
which has been referred to.
If the Supreme Government had power to direct the titlepapers to be issued, and the dispatch operated to adjudicate the
title in that case, it must be deemed to have possessed the same
authority, and a similar operation must be attributed to the
dispatch in the case at bar.
But it is urged that a distinction should be drawn between
the cases, on the ground that islands on the coast were not
within the Colonization Law of 1824, and therefore might be
granted directly by the Supreme Executive, but that he had no
authority to act in relation to lands embraced within the pro.
visions of that law, except in obedience to it, and in conformity
with the regulations of 1828.
It has already been shown that under the Colonization Law
the President had authority either directly to grant, or to order
the Governor to grant, public lands in the territories. But his
power to grant islands was also derived from the same law, and
in making the grant of the island of Santa Cruz, the validity of
which has been affirmed by the Supreme Court, he acted in strict
obedience to it.
It will also be seen that the judgment of the Supreme Court
is not based on the supposed existence of any authority in the
Executive not derived from the law of 1824; and also that his
right to repeal or modify at his will, in a particular case, his
own general regulations which imposed rules on the subordinate
local authorities, is impliedly recognized in the decisions re
forred to.

SUPREME

COURT.

The United States vs. Andre.z Castillero.
The 4th article of the law of 1824 provides, that "the lands
embraced within the twenty leagues bordering on any foreign
nation, or within ten leagues of the seacoast, cannot be colonized
without the previous gpprobation of the Supreme Executive
power. "
As by the Frevious section of the law, thp Congreqses of the
various States were directed to enact laws and regulations for
colonization within their respective territories, while by Art. 16
a similar duty was enjoined upon the Supreme Executive with
respect to lands within the territories, it is obvious that the 4th
article was intended chiefly to restrict the power of the States
rather than that of the Executive, whose assent to the grant was
all that was required.
In the case of The United States vs. Arquello, (18 How., 548,)
it was held by the Supreme Court that the "colonization" spoken
of in the 4th article must be construed to mean colonization by
foreigners, and not the distribution of. lands to individuals and
families.
The power of the Governors of California to grant lands withi,
the ten littoral leagues might perhaps have been sustained, evo
if the 4th article be construed to apply to grants to individuals,
on the ground that the absence of any express prohibition in the
regulations, and the constant exercise of the power with the full
tnowledge of the Supreme Government, authorize the prc,umption that the approval required by the 4th article was in
hct given.
However this may be, it is clear that the Governors of California did not assume to grant the islands on the coast without
the previous permission of the Supreme Government. Appli,;ation for such permission was accordingly made, and it was final1
communicated to the Departmental authorities in the dispatch (f
Pesada of July 20, 1838.
When, therefore, the President ordered a grant of an island tc
be mad,-, which order the Governor obeyed by issuing the titlepapers The grant was in strict conformity with the colonization
laws.

observed, the whole subject of colonization within the territories,
nor did it impose any limits on the exercise of his discretion,
except that the colonization -'as to be conducted according to
the principles established by the law.
Those principles were of a general character, and fixed nothing
as to the particular agencies or mode to be adopted in conferring
the title upon the colonist.
In the case of lands within the ten littoral leagues, the law
itself forbade their colonization without the previous approbation
of the Supreme Executive power. The general regulations
therefore, by which the Supreme Executive authorized the
Governors and Juntas of the Departments to grant public lands,
were never construed to authorize them to grant the islands on
the coast, and as observed by the Supreme Court, the power to
make such grants was neither claimed nor exercised by the
Departmental authorities prior to the 20th day of July, 1838,
when the "previous. approbation of the Supreme Executive"
required by the law was communicated to them.
That approbation having been thus obtained, the Departmental
authorities proceeded to grant; and in so doing acted in precise
conformity with the colonization laws.
It had appeared to this Court, that the effect of that dispatch
was simply to communicate to the Departmental authorities the
assent of the Supreme Executive that the islands should be
granted, and thus to bring them within the general regulations
which prescribed the mode in which all grants should be made.
Those regulations required the concurrence of the Departmental Assembly to give definitive validity to the grant by the
Governor; but inasmuch as the Supreme Court had decided
that even without the concurrence the grant was valid, unless
the grantee's right had been forfeited by abandonment, it seemed
to me that a similar rule should be observed with respect to the
,grants of islands, which, by the previous assent of the Supreme
Elxecutive, had been brought within the general regulations.
This view, however, the Supreme Court decided to be erroneous, and held that the dispatch prescribed a new rule on the
subject, and that the general regulations did not apply to it.

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
The mode of granting indicated in the dispatch of Pesada wag
therefore, to be strictly followed, and inasmuch as the Depait
mental Assembly 'had not concurred, the grant to Osio wa,
adjudged to be void.
Bu the reversal of the decision of the District Court on t1va
point, in no way shows that the Supreme Court did not considei
grants of islands, when made in pursuance of either the general
or special regulations of the Executive, as not made under the
colonization law.
On the contrary, it appears to me manifest, that neither in the
case of Osio, nor in that of Castillero, do the Supreme Court
base their decision on the idea that grants of islands were not
within the colonization law of 1824; but that they reject the
first claim, because in their opinion the grant was not made in
the manner prescribed by the Executive, to whom that law
committed the whole power over the subject, and they confirm
the second claim because the Executive instructions were followed. It is explicitly stated in the opinion, "that it is immaterial whether or not the power to grant the islands on the
coast was vested in the Governor," (i. e. by the General Executive regulations of 1828), for the effect of the dispatch "was to
repeal the previous regulations on the subject, and to substitute
a new one in their place."
As this power of making regulations, with respect to colonization in the territories, was conferred, in terms, on the Supreme
Executive, by the Colonization law, and was precisely that
which it exercised when the General Executive regulations of
1828 vwere framed, I confess myself unable to perceive how a
grant of an island on the coast, made in obedience to Executive
instructions, was not, in every respect, a grant under the Coloni
zation laws, nor can I discover any foundation for the distinction
attempted to be drawn between the case at bar and that of the
island of Santa Cruz. The lands, in both cases, were open to
grant under the general law; and even, if the granting of the
islands on the coast to individuals be considered to be embraced
within the provisions of the 4th article, and that grants of lands
within the littoral leagues were not, the only distinction between

DECEMBER TER.M[, 1862.

347

The United States vs. Andres (astillero.
the cases would be, that in one the previous assent of the Executive was necessary, while in the other it was not. Each, when
regularly granted, must be held to have been granted under the
colonization laws. When, therefore, in the Santa Cruz Island
case, the Supreme Court held that the dispatch of the Minister,
ordering one of the islands to be assigned to Castillero, "operated to adjudicate the title," the same construction must be given
to the dispatch in this case, which states that the President has
acceded to a petition for two leagues, and orders the Governor
to put the petitioner in possession.
As, then; the Lanzas dispatch " operated to adjudicate the title"
to the claimant, he must be held to have acquired an inchoate
title, Which, if founded on such equitable considerations as would
-have bound the former Government to complete it by issuing
the formal title-papers, this Government is equally bound tc
respect.
Had the claimant, been an ordinary colonist, and relying on
the action of the Supreme Government on his petition, settled
upon and occupied the land, building a house upon and cultivating it, and had the United States found him in the enjoyment
of an undisputed possession, it cannot, I think, be doubted that
his possession would have been undisturbed and his title confirmed, even though he had neglected to obtain from-the Governor the f6rmal grant.
But no such possession was taken in this case, nor was the
concession received in California or even known to have been
made, until after the subversion of the Mexican authority.
The question therefore arises: Were there any antecedent
equitable considerations on which the concession was founded,
such as would have bound the conscience of the Mexican
Govezin:ent to perfect it?
That an antecedent consideration, such as the patriotic and
public services of the grantee, is one which a Court of Equity
cannot disregard, has been expressly decided by the Supreme
Court.
In the case of Frem6nt vs. the United States, the Court says:
"The grant was not made merely to carry out the policy. of

348

SUPREME COURT.
The United S1tes vs. Andres Castillero.

the colonization laws, but in consideration of the previous public
and patriotic services of the grantee; and although this cannot
be regarded as a money consideration, making the transaction a
purchase from the Government, yet it is the acknowledgment
of a just and equitable claim, and when the grant was made on
that consideration, the title in a Court of Equity ought to be as
firm and valid as if it had been purchased with money on the
same conditions." 17 How. 558.
If,then, antecedent considerations of this nature are to be
looked to, in determining whether the former Government was
under any equitable obligation to perfect the title of the claimant, it is perhaps n6t easy to imagine a case where the merits of
the petitioner and the consideration rendered by him for a small
tract of land in a remote Department could be greater.
The immense value of the discovery he had made to the great
mining interests of Mexico, need not be dwelt upon. Our own
experience in California enables us at once to appreciate how
indispensable is an ample and cheap supply of quicksilver to thE
development of mines of the precious metals. But to Mexico
the discovery was, as justly observed by one of the counsel for
the claimants, "the unsealing of a hidden fountain of wealth, as
precious to her as the rains and dews and living streams are to
the nations that live by tillage."
For years it had been the policy of Mexico to stimulate.
explorations for and to encourage the working of quicksilver
mines. By the laws of February 20, 1822, and 7th October,
1823, which imposed duties on gold and silver, quicksilver wai
expressly exempted from contribution.
.h 1842, the Junta de Fomento was established, and em.
powered "to fix the mode in which the working of quicksilver
mines was to be supplied, rewarded, stimulated and protected."
By the decree of May 24, 1843, rewards of $35,000, and of $5
per quintal, were promised to successful miners; and by the
decrecs of July 5th and September 25th of the same year, the
Junta was empower d to work, to supply and protect quick
silver mines, and to cause researches for thim to be made
throughout the Republic.

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

349

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

When, therefore, Castillero announced the discovery of a
mine surpassing in richness that of Almaden in Spain, upon
which Mexico had so long been dependent, and desired a grant
of two leagues in a Department where land was commonly distributed gratuitously in tracts five times as large, he had equitable claims upon the Government far surpassing "the public
and patriotic services of Alvarado," which the Supreme Court
declares to have been an equitable consideration, as strong as if
the grant had been purchased with money;
Compared with the service rendered and about to be rendered
to the Mexican nation by Castillero, the consideration on which
the ordinary colonization grants were founded was insignificant;
for that consideration merely consist6d in building a house,
cultivating a few acres of an immense tract, and suffering wild
cattle to roam at will over the remainder.
The fact that he was working the mine showed that Castille: o
had already effected a -ettlement upon the land, and its furthr
development insured an accession to the population of the
country far greater thancould have been obtained by any other
disposition of the public domain.
The purpose for which he sought the land, apprised the
Government that it was of a kind not usually fit for cultivation,
for it was required to supply wood for his burnings. In thus
assisting his enterprise, the nation had as great an interest as
Castillero himself, for it was the attainment of an object to which
their attention, their efforts, and no inconsiderable portion of
their revenues had long been devoted.
It has appeared to me that all these circumstances constitute
an equitable consideration for the inchoate title or concession
obtained by Castillero, and that they were sufficient to create an
equitable obligation on the former Government, and therefore,
on this, to complete and make good the inceptive rights he had
acquired.
It is urged by the counsel for the United States, that even if
the Castillo Lanzas dispatch be considered a grant, it nevertheless
is void, because no Pgs'session of the land was given before the
7th of July, 1846, when the Mexican authority in California was

350

subverted, and the United States acquired the land by the ad.
verse title of conquest.
It is not denied that, as maintained in the brief of the counsel for the United States, in questions of prize or no prize, the
liability of the property captured to condemnation depends
upon the fact whether th6 possession and actual control of it
have passed from the hands of the enemy to those of a neutral.
Nor is it questioned that, where the territory is ceded by one
Sovereign to another, the nationality of the inhabitants of the
ceded territory is not changed until the stipulations of the treaty
are executed by a formal delivery given, and by possession
taken.
It is also admitted that, by the Roman law, and by most
systems of jurisprudence, the property in a thing cannot be
transferred without a delivery of the possession of the thing,
either actual, or feigned and constructive ; and that ordinarily,
he who first obtains possession shall hold the thing even as
against a prior purchaser, to whom it has not been delivered.
In the transfer of land the same principle prevailed at the common law, and a symbolical delivery of the land, or livery of
seizin, w'as indispensable to render a feoffment operative.
This, however, is now unnecessary in conveyances under the
Statute of Uses.
In the grants made by the Governors of California, we ac
cordingly find that "the judicial delivery of possession by the
corresponding Judge" was always contemplated. This proceed
ing would seem to have been designed for a double purpose:
1st. To complete the transfer of the property, by a formal delivery or tradition of the thing, thus adding the jus in re to the
.]us ad rem; and, 2d. To designate and sever from the public
domain the tract granted by measuring its extent and establishing its boundaries.
Whether, if the boundaries are distinctly designated in the
grant, the judicial delivery of possession was in strictness necessary to complete the right of property in the grantee, may be
doubted; for at common law the King's grant was hold to im

port livery of seizir. and the same principle is said to prevail

at civil law.
But whether technically necessary or not, it is settled by the
decisions of the Supreme Court, that the want of a judicial delivery of possession is no obstacle to the confirmation of a grant
of lands in California.
The occupation and settlement which, in the Louisiana and
Florida cases, were considered to constitute the true grounds of
the claimant's equity, were required by the Supreme Court
to be shown, not because the technical rule required a formal
delivery of, possession to complete the transfer of the right of
property, but, because the petitioner, by occupying and cultivating his land under an inchoate title, and an implied promise
of a grant, had rendered to the former Government a consideration which bound its conscience and that of its successors to.
perfect the title.
The question then, in this and other cases, is not whether a
tbrmal and technical delivery of possession has been made; but
whether a consideration has been given for the grant, either anwcedent by public services, the payment of money and the like,
or subsequent, by occupation, settlement, &c., which in equity
required the former Government to convert the inchoate title
actually obtained into a perfect title. If, at the acquisition of
the countiy, the conscience of the former Government was
bound by this obligation it is equally binding upon us; and
the claimant, whether a resident or a foreign Mexican, has a
right of property which the United States have agreed by the
treaty to respect.
Whether the consideration rendered, and the equitable claims
on the bounty of the Mexican Government possessed by Castillero, are sufficient to create such an obligation, is a questiol
which, perhaps, depends rather on the spirit in which his claims
are looked upon, than upon any lefinite rule of law. It has
appeared to me, as before stated, tl'at the consideration rendered
by him to the Mexican Gover nmeat did not merely constitute a
'laim upon its bounty; but that when he had obtained the
qwnt ot thL Supreme autho .ty to a grant of a specific Ir co

SUPREME COURT.

of land, when orders had been issued to make him a grant and
to put him in possession, the execution of which was prevented
solely by the outbreak of war, the inchoate title so obtained
ought'to be respected by the United States.
But if the fact of possession and occupation be insisted on as
indispensable, it is to be remembered that the land solicited and
ordered to be granted to Castillero, was two leagues "on the
land of his mining possession."
It is not disputed that early in December, 1845, he had occupied and worked the mine.
Possession of it had been given to him by the Alcalde, in a
loose and informal manner, it is true, but still sufficient to give
an official sanction to his occupation, more than six months
before the conquest of the country; and from December, 1845,
he and his assigns have continued to hold it. As, then, the mine
was within the two leagues solicited, and as he had already
taken possession of, and was working it, he may, perhaps, be
considered, after the order of Lanzas was issued, to have been
in possession of the lands referred to in that order.
In no cases was any other possession taken by the California
rancheros of the large tracts'-sometimes eleven square leagues
in extent-granted to them, than by building a rude house of
abode, cultivating a small portion of the land, and stocking the
remainder with a greater or less number of wild cattle or horses.
I am aware that in this view of the claimant's equities, I have
the misfortune to differ"from the Circuit Judge.
But on the best consideration I have been able to give to the
subject, it has appeared to me not only warranted by the decisions of the Supreme Court, but in accordance with the dictates
of the enlarged, and, so to speak, generous justice, which should
animate a great and a conquering nation in dealing with the
rights of the vanquished.
But it is said that if Castillero obtained from the Supreme
Government a grant of two leagues on his mining possession, it
proves one of two propositions,-either that he was guilty of a
gross fraud in suppressing the fact, that such a grant would
include private land, or that the Supreme Government committed

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States.vs. Andres Castillero.
a violation of law equally gross, in attempting to grant the lands
of private individuals.
Had the title set up been a formal and absolute grant of two
leagues, to be measured in every direction from the mouth of
the mine, the observation would have possessed much force.
But such is not the import of the Lanzas dispatch; on the con
trary, it directs the Governor to put the petitioner in possession
of the land solicited, "in conformity with the laws and dispositions on colonization," a direction which rendered it certain that,
in the location of the grant, private rights would be respected.
Had the Supreme Government known that a tract of two leagues,
measured in every direction from the mouth of the mine, would
include private land, the precautions used in framing the ordet
to the Governor would have sufficed for the protection of tho
owner; and the dispatch is, in effect, but the expression of the
President's assent to a grant of two leagues on land of the
petitioner's mining possession, and an order to the Governor to
execute the grant; provided, and so far as it could be done,
without injury to third persons.
It cannot, therefore, be inferred from this dispatch, either that
Castillero practiced a fraud on the Government, or that the latter
committed, or intended to commit, a violation of any private
rights whatever.
The last objection to the validity of the Lanzas dispatch which
I shall notice, is that contained in the seventh division of the
printed argument filed by the counsel for the United States.
The same point had been raised and fully considered by the
Court in the case of Palmer vs. The United States. As the decisions of this Court have not been reported, it has been thought
most convenient to append that opinion to this, adding to'it such
further observations as may seem appropriate:
"Beforeproceeding to an examination of the merits of this
case, a general objection to the validity of the grant must be
considered. The grant purports to have been executed on the
25th of June, 1856, subsequently to the declaratioa of war
between the United States and Mexico.

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
It is contended, on the part of the United States, that on
general principles of public law, grants made flagrante hello when
conquest has been set on foot, and actual occupation is imminent
and inevitable, have no validity against the subsequent con
queror. The question has not heretofore been presented to his
Court. It has been discussed with much ingenuity and ability.
It is urged that in the conduct of war, and the determination
of its objects, the political department is supreme; and that the
judiciary are bound by the view taken by the political branch
of the Government; that, although Congress has alone power to
declare war, to the Executive is given the right of shaping it to
its ends, or of declaring its objects.
To ascertain its objects, resort must, therefore, be had to
Executive acts, and as the Executive acts in this case unequivocally indicate that a principal objec: of the war was to acquire
California, that acquisition was thus brought within the scope
of the war, and must be so regarded by the Courts.
To this point, the case of ifarcourt vs. Gaillard,(12 Wheat.,)
is cited.
Such being the object or scope of the war, it is urged that the
intended conquest of California embraced not only the establishment of sovereign rights in the Territory, but also the acquisition
of the public property within it.
That the proprietary rights to be acquired by the conquest
are as essential, though not as important a part of the fruits of
conquest, as the political, the commercial, and other advantages
proposed to be obtained, and that no part of these objects of the
conqtuest is to be ignored.
The conquest of California, including the acquisition of the
public domain, having been thus shown to have been the object,
or brought within the scope of the war, it was urged that any
grants of public land made after the conquest was projected.
and when it was about to be effected, though before it actually
occurred, must be deemed to be in fraud of the rights of the
incoming conqueror, and invalid as against him.
The foregoing statement is believed to present the outline cf
the argument submitted on the part of the United States.

DIXJEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

Both the premises and the conclusion must be examined.
must
If the conquest of California was the object of the war, "it
be so considered because that object was avowed by competent
authority when war was declared; or because it was made the
object of the war, after its commencement, by. the political
branch of the Government.
It may be admitted that this Government had long regarded'
California, or the Bay of San Francisco, as an important and
desirable acquisition. The instructions of the President to Mr.
Slidell indicate the wish of the Executive to obtain it by purchase and cession, as Louisiana and Florida have been acquired.
It by no means follows tha; the intentiou to obtain it by force
of arms, or conquest, can be attributed to Congress,,still less that
such was its object or motive in declaring war.
The law by which war was declared, recognizes it as previously
existing by the act of Mexico; and it is known that hostilities
arose by tha invasion by Mexico of a territory claimed by the
United States to be within their limits. Such was not, therefore,
the'object for which war was declared, or its existence recognized
-nor could it constitutionally have been.
It is observed by Mr. Chief Justice Taney, in Flemingvs. Page,
(9 How., 614,) "The genius and character of our institutions are
peaceful, and the power to declare war was not conferred upon
Congress for the purpose of aggression or aggrandizement, but
to enable the General Government to vindicate by arms, if it
should becomb necessary, its own rights and the rights of its
citizens.

A war, therefore, declared by Congress, can never be

presumed to be waged for the purpose of conquest or the acquisition of territory."
As a limitation upon the power of Congress, this distinction
may, practically, be unimportant. As every war in which the
country may be engaged must be regarded by all branches of
th,3 Government, and even by neutrals, as a just war; and as
nations can readily cloak a spirit of rapacity and aggression
under professions of justice and moderation, it is at all times
easy, should our country be actuated by such a spirit, to declare
an aggressivr var, to be undertaken in self-defense and an in.

tended conquest to be desired only as a compensation for past
or security against future injuries.
But the distinction is important when a Court is asked to
presume that conquest was the object of the war.
Under our Government, at least, such a presumption cannot
be indulged.
The conquest of California being thus shown not to have been
the object for which war was declared, we may next inquire
whether, by the acts of the Executive under its power to conduct
the war, it became such, or was brought within its scope, in the
sense in which the phrase was used at the bar?
In his annual message to Congress, in December, 1846, the
President distinctly states that the war originated in the attempt
of Mexico to re-conquer Texas to the Sabine. After adverting
to the considerations which had induced the Executive to interpose no obstacles to the return of Santa Anna, the latter being
more fa-rorably disposed to peace than Paredes, who was then
at the head of affairs, the President observed: 'The war has not
been waged with a view to conquest, but having been commenced by Mexico, it has been carried into the enemy's country,
and will be vigorously prosecuted there, with a view to obtain
an honorable peace, and thereby secure ample indemnity for the
expenses of the war, as well as our much injured citizens, who
have large pecuniary demands against Mexico.'
Similar declarations are frequently and emphatically repeated
by the President in various communications to Congress, and in
the correspondence between the American Commissioner and
the Mexican authorities.
The object of the war, therefore, as indicated by executive
acts and declarations, was not conquest; or, if conquest, it was
that of a safe and honorable peace.
It is true, that after the military occupation of California, and
after our arms had been everywhere successful, and perhaps at
the commencement of hostilities, the Executive and the nation
may have confidently anticipated that by the treaty of peace we
would acquire California. As Mexico was known to be impoverished, and distracted by civil dissen3ions, it was obvious

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
The United Stales vs. Andres Castillero.
that the only indemnity she could afford us for the expenses of
the war was the cession of a portion of her territory.
The instructions of the Secretary of State to Mr. Trist, show
that the extension of the b-oundaries of the United States over
New Mexico and Upper California, for a sum not exceeding
$20,000,000, was a condition sine qua non of any treaty.
The extraordinary success of our arms, the fact that we already
held possession of a great part of the territory of the enemy,
and virtually of his capital, our great expenditures of blood and
treasure, entitled us to retain a portion, at least, of our conquest
as the only indemnity we could obtain. But we were willing to
restore a considerable part of our possessions, and to pay for
that retained by us a large amount of money.
But such views and intentions on the part of the Executive,
as to the condition on which the war should cease, are very
different from waging it with a view to conquest. The wai
cannot, then, in any just sense, be deemed to have been declared
by Congress, or conducted by the Executive, with a view to
conquest.
The power of the President in the conduct of the war was
that of a commander-in-chief of the army and navy. He had
authority to direct and control military operations. As part of
the treaty-making power, he could Aetermine when and on what
conditions a treaty of peace should be 'made. But he had no
power to impress upon the war a purpose different from that
vith which it was commenced, and which, as Mr. Chief Justice
Taney, declares, Congress could not constitutionally entertain.
'The law declaring war,' observes the same great authority in
the case above cited, 'does not imply the authority to the
President to enlarge the limits of the United States by su bjugating the enemy's country. The United States, it is true, may
extend its boundaries by treaty or conquest, and may demand
the cessation of territory as the condition of peace, to indemnify
its citizens for the injuries they suffered, or to reimburse the
Government for the expenses of the war.
'But this can be done only by the treaty-making power, or
the legislative authority, and it is not a part of the aiithorit y

conferred upon the President by the declaration of war. His
duty and his- power are purely military. As commander-in.
chief, he is authorized to direct the military and naval forces
placed by law at his command, and to employ them in the
manner he may deem most effectual to harass and conquer and
subdue the enemy., He may invade the hostile country, and subjugate it to the sovereignty and authority of the United States
But his conquests do not enlarge the boundaries of the United
States, nor extend the operations of our institutions and laws
beyond the limits before assigned them by the legislative power.
It is true that in the case in which these observations are
made, the point to be determined was, whether enemies' territory, which in the course of hostilities had come into our
military possession, became a part of the United States, and
subject to our general laws. But they are important to this case
as defining the power of the President in war, to be merely
that of the military commander-in-chief; that territory can be
acqifired only by the treaty-making and legislative authority,
and, consequently, that the fact that hostilities are by the military authority directed against a particular portion of the
enemy's territory, cannot be said to make the acquisition of that
territory the object of the war.
It is therefore apparent that the war with Mexico cannot bV
regarded by the judicial department of this Government as corn
menced, or conducted, with the object of effecting the conquest
of California.
The most that can be said is, that its military occupation was
effected as a means of crippling and subduing the enemy, and
with the expectation, on the part of the Executive, that we
would retain and finally insist upon the cessation of the territory so subjugated by our arms as an indemnity for our injuries
and expenses..
The nature and amount of indemnity to be"required, the extent
of territory- to be ceded, depended upon the will of the Senate
and the Executive as the treaty-making power, and until that
will was expressed in the treaty, the intention to effect the per
manent acquisition of all California cannot be attributed to the

political power, any more than a similar intention with regard to
those co~quests which at the close of the war was restored.
If, then, it were a principle of public law that all alienations
of public domain by a sovereign are invalid as against an enemy
who has commenced or is prosecuting a war, with the object of
conquering the territory within which the property is situated,
or who has set on foot expeditions for the purpose, with sufficient
power to attain the end, as proved by the event, the facts of this
case would hardly admit of its application.
But assuming the facts as contended for by the United States,
we proceed to inquire whether such a rule of law exists. The
right of Mexico to dispose of her public domain in California
before the war is admitted. It is not denied that that right
ceased, as against the United States, when the latter effected the
conquest of the country, and subverted the Mexican authority.
If it ceased before the actuaL conquest and displacement of the'
Mexican authority, it must be because the determination of the
United States to effect the conquest, and the making preparatioi to carry out its determination, gave to the latter some
inchoate or inceptive right to the territory subsequently conquered, and the title consummated by the conquest relates back
by a kind of fiction to the date of its inception.
We have been unable to discover any trace or intimation of
such a doctrine in any writer on the laws of war.
The rights derived from conquest are derived from force alone.
They are recognized because thete is no one to dispute them,
not because they are, in a moral sense, rightful and just. The

fore the assertion of an antecedent right.
It is the assertion of the will and the power to wrest it from
him.
Even where a conquest is effected to obtain an indemnity
justly due, it is not the assertion of any antecedent right to the
particular territory conquered, but only of the general right to
a compensation for injury.
The right of the *conqueroris, therefore, derived from the conquest alone. - t originates in the conquest, -ot in the intention

to conquer, though coupled with the ability to effect his purpose,
nor even in the right to conquer as means of obtaining satisfaction for injury.
It is the fact of conquest, not the intention or power to conquer, which clothes him with the rights of a conqueror.
The rights acquired by the conquest are temporary and precarious until the jus jost liminii is extinguished; and if a reconquest is effected, the rights of the sovereign who has temporarily
been displaced revive, and are deemed to have been uninterrupted.
The term 'title by conquest' expresses, therefore, a fact and
not a right. Until the fact of conquest occurs, the conqueror
can have no rights. To affirm that a title acquired by conquest
rolates back to a period anterior to the conquest, is almost a contradiction in terms.
Until, then, the conquest is effected, the rights of the existing
soveteign remain unimpaired. He can, therefore, dispose of the
public property at his discretion, nor can that right be effected
by the determination of an enemy to conquer the territory, and
by his preparations for the purpose, though the event may
demonstrate the conquest to have been practicable.
The case of Hfarcourt vs. Gaillarc has been cited by the counsel of the United States in support of the doctrine contended for
by them.
The distinction between that case and the case at bar is
ubvious.
In Harcourt vs. Gaillard the question was as to the validity

of a grant by a British Governor of land within a territory
claimed to belong to the United States. As our Government
had asserted and maintained by arms its title to the disputed
tract, the Judicial Department were not at liberty to declare the
claim to be wrongful, and to recognize the right of any other
Sovereign over the territory in question.
The title of the United States was in no sense acquired by
conquest, Her title was antecedent to the war-it was merely
maintained by arms and recognized by the treaty of peace.
The question presented was, in the language of the Cour.

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

861

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.

'one of disputed boundaries, within whichthe power that suc
ceeds in war is not obliged to recognize as valid any acts of
ownership exercised by his adversary.'
Had the claim been that of conquest alone, the case would
have presented, says the Court, more difficulty. ' That ground
would admit the original right of the Governor of Florida to
grant, and if so, his right to grant might have continued until
the treaty of peace, and the grant to Harcourt might, in that
case, have had extended to it the principles of public law which
are applicable to territories acquired by conquest, whereas the
right set up by South Carolina and Georgia denies all power in
the grantor over the soil.'
The distinction is made still more apparent in a subsequent
part of the opinion of the Court: ' War is a suit prosecuted by
the sword; and.where the question to be decided is on6 of original
claim to territory,grants of soil madeflagrante bello by the party.

that fails, can only derive validity from treaty stipulations. It
is not necessary here to consider the rights of the conquerorin case
of actual conquest.' (P. 528.)

The latter is precisely the question to be considered in the
case at bar.
The argument of the counsel for the United States can, therefore, derive no support from the case referred to.
It is proper, however, to observe that the case of Hfarcourt vs.
Gaillard,was not cited by the counsel as directly in point. It
was thought tb establish that -all grants of territory brought
within the scope of the war are invalid; that the case of disputed
boundaries presents one illustration of the general principle,
while the case at bar furnishes another.
It has seemed to me, however, that the principle of that
decision relates exclusively to the case of disputed boundaries,
and that the distinctioji is clearly drawn between that case and
one like the present; that between them the obvious difference
exists that the former is a case of 'original claim to territory,'
while the other is 'one of actual conquest.'
It is said, on the part of the United States, that if a belligerent
can, after a de(laration of war, grant any portion of his property

he can grant the whole, and thus might, by granting himself
away. escape responsibility. The case supposed is an extreme
one. It can rarely occur that a notion will seek safety by selfdestruction.
But in such case the adversary might refuse to recognize such
a voluntary suicide as affecting his rights. For the purpose of
obtaining satisfaction he might justly treat the nationality sought
to be extinguished as still existing. But in all Courts his rights
would be enforced against the successor or grantee of the extinguished Sovereign.
The question would then be purely political, for the new
Sovereign, whether to carry on the war or accede to the demands
of the enemy of his grantor, and for the latter whether to prosecute the war against the new Sovereign. Little aid, however,
can be derived from the consideration of such extreme and
improbable cases.
It is further urged, that the doctrine contended for on behalf
of the United States is in the prize law.
It may, perhaps, be admitted that a theory of maritime prize
formerly obtained, which assumed that a belligerent has a vested
right by the declaration of war in all sea-borne private property
if the other belligerent; that no such property can be the sub.
ject of lawful sale; that all contracts of sale touching belligerent
property of any sort, though valid on land, are invalidated by
the mere fact of such property being embarked on the ocean,
and that if transferred to a neutral after the declaration of war
it is a lawful prize to the other belligerent.
Such is not now the received law of natiots. It is now
admitted that the bona fide sale of the ships of belligerents 'to
neutrals in time of war is lawful and valid unless made in
transitu.
In the Johanna Emilia, 29 Eng. L. & Eq. R., p. 562, Dr.
Lushington says: 'It is not denied that it is competent for neutrals to purchase the property of enemies in another country,
whether consisting of ships or anything else. They have a
perfect right to do so, and no belligerent right can override it.'

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

368

The United States vs. Andres Castiltero.
Such is the doctrine maintained by our Government. See
opinion of Mr. Attorney-General Cushing, October 8, 1855.
If a sale to a neutral of a ship in transituis held invalid as
against a belligerent, it is not by reason of any inchoate xight or
lien acquired by the latter by the mere declaration of war, or
because the right of the.enemy to dispose of his property is invalidated by the declaration of war, but because a sale of a ship
in transitu is taken as proof of collusion and fraud, and as
showing that no absolute transfer has, in fact, been made. The
soundness of even this rule is doubted by the Attorney-General
in the opinion referred to.
A sale of a ship not in transit, by a belligerent to a neutral is
valid as against a subsequent captor, no-matter how imminent
the danger of capture would have been had she remained
enemy's property, and no matter what may be the number of
hostile fleets fitted out to cruise against her and similar property
of the belligerent.
It appears, then, that the law of nations, with regard to prize
of war, does not recognize the principle contended for.
It is urged, however, that this principle lies at the foundation
of the doctrine of pos t liminii,
It is argued that a state of war implies the reciprocal denial,
by each belligerent, of all rights on the other.
That each relies upon force alone-force to retain or force to
take.
They are thus in wqualijure.
The principle, therefore, by which, on a reconquest, the
original title revives, and is deemed to have been uninterrupted,
is founded on the presumption that the displaced Sovereign
intended a reconquest when he was displaced, and his title on
a reconquest relates back to the time when he is presumed to
have formed such intention. If, then, (itis argued,) the title by
reconquest relates back to the time of the foxmation of the
intention to reconquer, the title by conquest must relate back to
a similar period; for a state of war implies the negation of all
antecedent right on either side. The only difference between
the cases being, that in the case of a reconquest, the intention to

SUPREME

COURT.

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
reconquer is presumed until the jas post liminii is extinguished,
while in the case of conquest that intention must be shown by
the political acts and declarations of the conqueror.
The argument is ingenious, but the premises are, I think,
erroneous.
It is assumed that a new title is acquired by a Sovereign who
recovers territories from which he has temporarily been driven.
On the contrary, he holds it by his original title, which could
only have been displaced by a permanent conquest. But the
fact that he recovers the territory, proves that what seemed a
conquest was but a temporary dispossession. The invader,
therefore, acquired no rights, nor did the original sovereign lose
any. He continues to rule, not by a newly-acquired title which
relates back to any former period, but by his ancient title, which,
in contemplation of law, has never been divested.
Nor is it true that war is the reciprocal denial of all rights by
the belligerents, with respect to the territories of either.
A conqueror does not deny that the territory seized was, at
the time of the conquest, the territory of his enemy, any more
than the attaching creditor denies the property attached to be
that of his debtor.
On the contrary, he asserts it to be his. He seizes it as the
property of his enemy, and because it is his. He asserts no
antecedent title in himself. He declares, not that the territory
was his, but that he will make it his by conquest.
The title or right acquired by a conquest is not the same as
that of the original possessor.
It is temporary and precarious, and ceases the moment the
conqueror is expelled. If, indeed, a title by conquest can be
said ever to have existed when the event has proved that the
attempted conquest could not be maintained.
The title of the original owner is wholly unaffected by the
temporary dispossession; and even during his dispossession, it
is treated as valid and subsisting, until the jus post liminii has
)een extinguished.
The extinction of the .post liminii is necessary to -npen the

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

The United States vs. Andres Castillero.
temporary and merely possessary right of the conqueror into
such an ownership of the territory as neutrals can recognize.
If these views be correct, the case of a reconquest does not
present the instance supposed of a title relating back to the
period of the formation of the intention to reconquer.
But the further discussion of this subject would require more
time and space than can be devoted to it.
It might, I think, be demonstrated, that a rule which supposes
all rights of a Sovereign, with respect to territory subsequently
conquered, to cease as against the conqueror, not when war is
declared, but when the war is prosecuted with the object of con
quest, when expediti6ns are fitted out for the purpose, and when
the conquest is 'imminent and inevitable,' is not susceptible of
practical application as a rule of international law.
That those rights must continue until the date - of actual
conquest, or of the treaty of cession, or else must cease at the
declaration of war, and that an attempt to estimate the 'immi
uency' of the conquest at any intermediate period, or to try the
validity of the exercise of soyereign rights, by calculating the
chances of war at'a particular moment, would be impracticable
and illusory.
On the whole, I am of opinion that the right of Mexico to
grant her public domain in California, continued until the con
quest of the country by the United States.
It is further urged, on the part of the United States, that
grants made after the 13th May are not protected by the treaty
of peace, because such was not the intention of the parties.
That the Mexican Commissioners who negotiated the peace,
aud who represented the claimants as well as the Mexican
Government, solemnly, and after special inquiry, declared that
none such existed; and that the treaty was negotiated on the
faith of this declaration.
It is admitted that such a declaration was made, and embodied
in the project of the treaty submitted to the Senate.
Had this declaration been contained in the treaty as adopted
and ratified, it might very possibly have been regarded as a

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Anares Castillero.
covenant or stipulation that no such grants should be deemed
valid by the United States.
But the clause containing it was struck out by the Senate, not
by the general vote which struck out the whole of the 10th
"article, of which this declaration formed a part, but by a distinct
vote upon the question whether this particular clause should
stand as a part of. the treaty.
The Court cannot assume, therefore, that a treaty was assented
to by the United States on the faith of this declaration by
Mexico, else why strike it out? It may, not unreasonably, be
supposed that the Senate refused to allow tJ.e declaration to
remain, because they were willing that gra~ts made after the
13th May, if any such there.wete, should be submitted to the
Courts, and rejected or confirmed, as might be just.
But assuming that the treaty was concluded on the faith of
this declaration, the rights of an individual to his property
cannot be affected by it.
The stipulation in the treaty by which the property of the
inhabitants of the ceded territory was secured, conveyed to them
no additional rights. 'An Article to secure this object, so
deservedly held sacred in the view of policy as well as of justice
and humanity, is always required and never refused.' 12
Wheat., 536.
'When such an article is submitted to the Courts, the inquiry
is, whether the land in controversy was the property of the
claimant before the treaty.' United States vs. Arredondo, (6 Pet,

712.)
If, then, the land in controversy was the private property of
the claimant when the country was acquired, it must have
remained such, though no treaty had been made. The United
States do not claim to have acquired the ownership of any other
property than the public property of the enemy, nor could they
justly have demanded that Mexico should assent by the treaty
to the confiscation of any property the right to which was
vested in private individuals.
If, then, the United States have been wilfully or accidentally
deceived, as to the amount of property held in private ownership

in the ceded territory, they may have a right to demand a
return of some portion of the pecuniary equivalent paid by
them.
The fraud or mistake of the Mexican Commissioners can have
no effect upon a private right held sacred by the laws and usages
of all civilized nations, which was not derived from the treaty,
and which, had it been known to exist, the United States would
have been bound to respect.
These observations are made with reference to the general
proposition maintained at the bar, viz., that the declaration by
"Mexico that no grants had been made subsequent to May 13,
1846, invalidated all such grants to the same extent as if a
stipulation to that effect had been embodied in the treaty'
In the brief filed in the case at bar, the Court is'invited to
review the grounds of the foregoing opinion; and the question
is discussed by the counsel of the United States with characteristic ingenuity and ability.
The authority chiefly relied on in support of the position
taken by the counsel for the United States, is Bynkershoek.
"We make war," says the author, "because we think that our
enemy, by the injurjr he has done us, has merited the destruction of himself and all his adherents; as this is the object of our
warfare, it ,is immaterial what means we embrace to accomplish
it." * * * "A nation which has injured another, is considerdd, with evrerything that belongs to it, as confiscated to the
nation that has received the injury. To carry that confiscation
into effect, may certainly be the object of the war, if the injured
nation thinks proper."
The doctrine here maintained, that in war, poison and eirery.
species of fraud may rightfully be used, has received the general
condemnatian of mankind. It may be the censure on Bynkershoek is not wholly deserved, inasmuch as he expresses no
approval of those practices, but differs from other writers mainly
in distinguishing between the absolute rights of war and those
voluntary relinquishments of them which are dictated by hu.
miamtv and generosity.

SUPREME COURT.
The United States vs. Andres Castill.o.
But if it be admitted that humanity, Christiwaity,. and the
usuges and rules observed by all civilized nations (which constitute public law), forbid even in war the use of certain means,
the discussion whether such rights abstractly exist, would seem
to be a disputation savoring rather of the subtlety of the schools
than of that practical sense which seeks to discover and establish
the actual rules by which nations in a state of war are governed.
That the rights of war, as deduced by Bynkershoek, from a
consideration of its abstract nature, are mitigaib.'l by the laws
of war as established by the general consent o." nations, with
respect to the effects of conquest, as' well as te the mode of
warfare, is proved by the general recognition of the principle
that, on the conquest of an enemy's territory, pri) -ate rights of
property are to be protected.
But if "a nation which has injured another is to be considered
as confiscated, with all that belongs to it, to the nation that has
received the injury," this confiscation must extend to private aF
well as public property.
A declaration of war undoubtedly involves the assertion of
the right to measure and forcibly to exact an indemnity for the
wrong which has occasioned the war.
To seize, to conquer, or to destroy an enemy's goods, h,
territory or his armed adherents, are but the means of exacting
this indemnity..
As a matter of theoretical speculation, we may consider the
seizure, the conquest, or the destroying, as done by virtue of a
previous fictitious or hypothetical confiscation of property, or
forfeiture of life, incurred at the date of the declaration of war.
But the necessity of such a theory is not very apparent. For
the right to subdue the enemy being admitted, as a means of
obtaining an indemnity for previous wrongs, the supposed constructive confiscation can add nothing to the rightfulness of those
acts. ' It is for this reason said, in the opinion above cited, that
"the conquest of an enemy's country, admitted to be his, is not
the assertion of an antecedent right. It is the assertion of the
will and power to wrest it from him." On which the counsel for
he United States observes: "Then all governmentp are high

waymen I Forcibly to take without antecedent right is a very
good definition of robbery2'
The inference is not just. Conquest is, undoubtedly, the
assertion of a right, but it is the right to conquer which results
from a state of war.
It is not the assertion of a previous right or title to the territories conquered.
Whether in so doing the belligerent is acting like a highwayman, depends upon the moral justification for the war; an inquiry
into which neither neutrals nor the Courts of the belligerent
cau enter.
The hypothesis of an antecedent confiscation, to enforce which
the seizure is effected, in no way affects the question. The
moral justification of the supposed confiscation has still to be
considered-in other words,-the justice and rightfulness of the
war.
But whatever be the reasonableness or necessity of supposing
this theoretic confiscation by belligerents, of everything belong.
ing to the enemy, it is manifest that by the laws of nations the
confiscation is waived where territory is conquered, so far as
respects private property; and especially where the conqueror,
by the terms of the treaty of cession, has bound himself to
respect all rights of private property existing at the date of the
conquest.
To repudiate that obligation with respect to any property held
in private ownership on the ground that, though private pro
perty when the conquest was effected, it was public property ten
or twenty or thirty years before, when the war commenced, and
that a writer on public law has said, that the declaration of war
is a confiscation of all the property of the enemy, and that the
conquest was merely carrying into effect the confiscation, would
seem an attempt to justify the breach of a plain and positive
obligation, which needs but to be stated to be condemned.
The obvious and natural construction of the treaty is, I think,
manifestly the true one, viz., that all private property bonafid
acquired, and held as such by a legal or equitable title obtained
under the former Government, is to be respected by the bellide.

rent, to whom by conquest and treaty the rights of sovereignty
have been transferred.
I do not think it necessary further to discuss this question. It
is enough to say that I have attentively considered all that is
urged by way of argument or illustration in the brief filed by
the counsel for the United States. I have found nothing to
which the answer did not appear to me easy, or which has shaken
my confidence in the justness of the views previously entertained
by the Court.
The question might well have been dismissed without argument; for we have an authoritative decision of the Supreme
Court on the point. In the case of The United States vs. Pico,
(23 How. R. 326,) the Court says: "In the Act of Congress of
1851, and the decisions of this Court that day (viz., July 7th.
1846, the date of the capture of Monterey and constructively,
of the conquest of California,) is referred to as the epoch at
which the power of the Governor of California, under the
authority of Mexico, to alienate the public domain, ceased."
As, however, the point then before the Court was the deter
mination of the precise date of subversion of the former Government, and to decide upon the validity of acts done under
Mexican authority after that event-while the validity of acts
done previous to it was not questioned, nor does the point
raised in this case appear to have been presented to the Court-I have thought it not improper to examine at some length the
acute and ingenious argument submitted by the counsel for the
United States.
I have given to this case much and anxious consideration.
The preparation of this opinion has required more labor than
even its great length would indicate.
Voluminous as it is, I am nevertheless aware that it is in
many respects incomplete.
To have treated at length every point in the case would have
extended it far beyond all reasonable limits.
I cannot conclude my labors on this most important case,
without acknowledging the great assistance which the Court

has derived from the very able and eminent counsel engaged
init.
Their indefatigable and exhaustive industry has presented to
the Court every argument, authority and illustration which profound and patient study, not only of the American and English,
but of the Mexican and Spanish laws, could suggest; together
with every view of the complicated facts in the case, and of their
relations to each other, which could assist the Court in its study
of the mass of depositions which have been taken.
To the Court has been left merely the duty of considering
the. suggestions, and collecting and combining the abundant
materials contained in the briefs of counsel.
On the whole case my opinion is:
That the claimants are entitled to seven pertenencias, to be
measured in the manner, of the form, and of the dimensions
prescribed in the Ordenanzas de Mineria of 1783.
And, also, that they are entitled to two square leagues of
land, to be located on the land of their mining possession, but
in such a way as not to include any land granted in private
ownership, by competent authority, previously to July 7th
1846."
