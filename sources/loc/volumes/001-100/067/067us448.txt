BEERS.

1. Where the Legislature of a State authorized Commissioners to
borrow money to be used in making a canal and for the redemption of the loan pledged the canal itself, its tolls, rents
and lands, the lien of a lender under such act cannot be
divested or postponed by a subsequent act of the Legislature.
2. The holder of bonds given for money advanced under such a
law has a security for his debt which is protected by that provision in the Constitution of the United States which forbids
a State to pass any law impairing the obligation of a contract.
3. The bondholder does not lose his lien on the lands and revenues
of the canal by surrendering.other bonds of a later issue and
of inferior security and taking canal stock and other bonds of
the State in place of them.
4. The holder having a legal security incapable of being defeated
without his consent, his surrender of one class of bonds, raises
no presumption either of law or fact that he intended to give
up his rights under the bonds which he kept.
6. Where-a lien creditor brings a bill in behalf of himself and other
creditors of the same class, and with similar rights, the decree
should provide proper relief for all of them.

the Wabash river, that State caused the route to be surveyed
and located, and an estimate to be made of the cost of construction, which was calculated at the sum of $1,081,970.
On the 7th day of January, 1832, an aci was passed, which
approved and adopted this survey and estimate, established a
Buard of Canal Commissioners, and authorized them to borrow
the sum of $200,000, to be used in making said canal. The fifth
section of this act is as follows: "That for the payment of the
interest, and redemption of the principal of the sums of money
which may be borrowed under the authority of the General
Assembly, for the construction of said canal, to the extent of the
estimated cost thereof, in the first section of this act stated, there
shall be and are hereby irrevocably pledged and appropriated,
all the moneys in any manner arising from the lands, donated
by the United States to this State, for the construction of said
section of said canal, the canal itself, with the said portion of
land thereto appertaining, or as much thereof as will realize by
sale the sum borrowed, and all privileges thereby created, and
the rents and profits-thereof belonging to the State, and the net
proceeds of tolls collected on said canal, or any part thereof, as
finished; the sufficiency of which for the purposes aforesaid, as
above allowed and provided for, the State of Indiana doth
hereby irrevocably guarantee."
Under this act there were issued two hundred bonds for one
thousand dollars each, two of which are held by complainant in
this suit; and the decree which was rendered in his favor, was
for the interest due and unpaid on them.
In 1834, the Legislature authorized another loan of $400,000,
for the benefit of the canal, for which the act again pledged the
canal and the lands granted by the Federal Government, and the
State guaranteed the sufficiency of the security.
In 1835, by another act, the Legisliture contracted a third
loan of $227,000, for the benefit of the canal. But for this it did
not pledge the canal, but only the faith of the State.
In 1836. a law was passed providing for a general system of
internal improvement, which authorized the State to borrow ten
millions of dollars, for which sum, in gross, she pldged her

canals, railroads, turnpikes, and the tolls and water rents arising
from them; and by the tenth section of that Act an additional
loan of $500,000 was authorized for the benefit of the canal, for
which the canal, its lands and resources, were again pledged as
security.
Of some one of these later loans, probably the ten million
loan, as they are called internal improvement bonds, the plaintiff became the owner of thirteen bonds, of $1,000 each.
Under the pressure of the large debt contracted by this last
act, and of the general financial distress which followed shortly
after it was created, the State found herself unable to pay the
interest on her bonds, her credit seriously impaired, and her
citizens weighed down with heavy taxation. In this state of her
affairs, she came Forward in 1846 with a propostion to her creditors, which is to be found embodied in the Act of January 19th,
1846, and the Supplementary Act of January 27th, 1847.
The principal features of these acts, so far as they concern our
present purpose, are, that the bonded debt of the State, except
its, bank stock bonds, should be equally divided between the
State and the Wabash and Erie Canal; that the bonds then out
should be surrendered, and in place of them the holders should
receive one-half in State stock certificates, bearing five per cent.
interest; and for the other half, Wabash and Erie Canal stock
certificates, bearing the like rate of interest. For the security
of the payment of the latter, the act provided that the entire
canal, its lands, revenues, and property of every description,
should be conveyed to trustees, whose powers and duties were
therein prescribed. As a means of completing the canal and
rendering it productive, the parties who surrendered their bonds
and received stock certificates in lieu thereof, were required to
pay ten per cent. on the amount of the new certificates for that
purpose. For this the Act also gave them a lien on the canal
and its revenues in the hands of the trustees. These statutes
were not to take effect until $4,000,000, which was about half
of the bonds of the State, were surrendered; and the canal was
not to be transferred to the trustees until $800,000 had been
sulseribed by holders of certificates for its completion. The

DECEMBER TERM, 1862

creditors of the State generally accepted this arrangement. The
necessary amount of bonds was surrendered to give effect to the
act, and the necessary sum was subscribed to authorize the
transfer of the canal to the trustees. The plaintiff surrendered
his thirteen bonds of the issue of the Act of 1836, and paid his
subscription of ten per cent., but he did not surrender his two
bonds issued under the Act of 1832, nor does it appear that any
bonds of that issue were surrendered.
It is claimed by counsel for appellant, that $981,970 of bonds
of the same class of the two retained by plaintiff were surrendered. This is founded on the idea, that of the bonds issued
under the Acts of 1834, 1835, and the 10th section of the Act
of 1836, so many are to be considered as entitled to the security
provided by the Act of 1832 as will make up with the $200,000
first issued, the estimated cost of the work mentioned in the
latter act. It is difficult to see how this can be maintained, if it
be in any way material to the determination of the case. The
bonds which were issued under these acts seem very clearly to
depend on the respective acts under which they were issued, for
any lien they may have had, on the canal, its lands and revenues,
and not on the Act of 1832; and the Act of 1835 gave no lien
at all on the canal or anything appertaining to it, but in place
thereof plddged the faith of the State for the payment of the
debt and interest. The purchasers of these bonds understood it
so no doubt, for it appears from the record, that while all of the
bonds issued under acts subsequent to 1832 were delivered up,
and stock certificates received for them, none of the $200,000
of that issue was so surrendered. But one reason can be
imagined for this, namely, that the security for those first issued
was sufficient, and the holders of them did not believe they
could improve their condition by an exchange for stock certificates, while the holders of the latter--bonds believed tlat with
the $200,000 lien prior to theirs, they would improve their condition by taking the State for one-half the debt and the canal
stock certificates for the other half. We think their conclusions
were sound, and that these several loans were liens of which zhe

first was paramount, and the others entitled to preference in the
order of their date.
If then these bonds were a lien on the canal, its lands and
revenues, paramount to all others, the Legislature of Indiana,
(whatever it may have designed to do,) could not divest that lien
or postpone it to others, because it was the result of contract,
and was protected by the provision of the Constitution of the
United States against impairing the obligation of contracts.
This is not controverted, but it is said that .plaintiff, by his own
act, has done that which the Legislature could not do; in delivering up his thirteen bonds, which were either no lien or at most
a secondary one, and receiving the canal stock certificates for
half of them and State stock certificates for the other half, and
by payment .of the ten per cent. on them required by the law.
This idea is strongly urged by counsel for appellant. It is the
only ground going to the merits on which plaintiff's right to a
decree is resisted, and we have given it our full consideration.
It presents itself in two aspects, each of which is entitled to a
separate examination. It is said first, that by the acts above
mentioned, the plaintiff established a relation between himself
and other parties who had made a like surrender of bonds and
a like advance of money, which makes it an act of bad faith in
him to assert in this suit, his right to priority of payment for
these bonds, when the result will probably be to deprive those
who took the canal certificates of all hope of payment, either for
the certificates, or for the money advanced to complete the
canal.
If the parties had stood in all respects in the same attitude
towards the fund, which was their common security at the time
of these transactions, and the plaintiff were now seeking to
appropriate that fund to the payment of his debt exclusively,
there would be great force in the argument. But such was not
the case.
The plaintiff held a double relation to that fund. He had, in
common with certain persons, a debt, which was a first and
paramount lien on it., and he had, in common with certain
other persons, a debt which was no lien, or if a lien, only

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

secondary, and of little value. In common with all those who
'held the prior lien he refused to surrender it. In common with
those -who held the other debts he surrendered his, and united
with them in such arrangements as were supposed to be for their
mutual benefit. There was no concealment of his interest in the
debt which had the prior lien, nor of the existence of that lien.
The number and character of the bonds which were liens on the
canal were matters of public record, accessible to every body,
and all prudent men must have acted in these matters in
reference to their existence. It could make no difference to the
parties who took the certificates of stock for these bonds, in
whose hands the prior lien was found. Its amount and its
validity were the same, whether in the hands of one who had
surrendered other bonds, -or of those who had surrendered
nothing. We do not attach any importance to the idea that
other persons may have been influenced by his example to surrender their bonds, so long as there is no evidence that he used
undue persuasion, or made improper representations.
If we were at liberty to inquire into the motives which
reduced parties to surrender their bonds, and pay their ten per
cent., they would. probably be found quite consistent with a
recognition of plaintiff's right under his prior bonds. The
security which they had was manifestly of little value. The
canal was incomplete. It paid no interest, and as matters then
stood would probably never pay any of the interest or principal
By surrendering these bonds they received State stock for half
the amount, for which the State pledged her integrity to provide by taxation, payment of both interest and principal. By
advancing $800,000 it was believed that the canal would be
completed, and rendered productive property, and if so, it was
expected to pay off all the bonds of the issue of 1832, and then
remain ample security for the $800,000 advanced, and for principal and interest of the canal stock certificates. These calculations seemed likely to be justified by the result, until the
wonderful multiplication of railroads ruined the canal by competl tin It was a common effort on the part of those who had

satisfactory, yield as much as possible; and the fact that one of
those had a paramount security on the same fund known to the
parties, cannot certainly be called an act of bad faith in him
since he risked his last investment as they did; nor can we perceive that the failure of the scheme, by events not foreseen by
any one, should deprive him now of the rights which he then
reserved.
But, in the second place, it is maintained that the effect of the
Acts of 1846, and 1847, when so far complied with as was necesnessary to put them in force, was to destroy all liens on the
canal which were not protected by them, and that no protection
was afforded in any case, unless the bonds were surrendered
and the new security taken. And while it is conceded that if
plaintiff had remained entirely aloof, the act could not have had
that effect as to him, it is insisted that his surrender of thirteen
bonds, and acceptance of the stock certificate for them, must be
held to imply his assent to all the provisions of these acts, including those which destroy his priority of lien for his two bonds of
1832.
If any such implication arises from the transaction, it must
be one of law, and not of fact; for it would be absurd to suppose
that while he consented to the destruction of his security for
those two bonds, he failed to surrender them, and get the faith of
the State for one-half, and a lien on the canal for the other. Such
a presumption must be one of those necessary legal presump.
tions which the law will not allow to be disproved by any
evidence whatever.
So far as he surrendered bonds and received certificate of
stook for them, it is beyond doubt that he accepted all the pro.
visions which related to those bonds; but any presumption that
he consented to waive other rights, must be based on the ground
that the acceptance of those certificates was incompatible with
the assertion of his rights in reference to the bonds which he did
tiot surrender. Those statutes did not require that all persons
who held bonds should surrender them, nor that all who did so
should surrender all they had. They provided that those
who chose to do so might deliver up their bonds and accept

the certificates of stock, but nothing was obligatory on the
State or the creditors until $4,000,000 of bonds were surrendered. When that event occurred, the arrangement was
binding. But to what extent? We can see no reason for
saying it was binding beyond the extent of the bond so ex
changed, as between the State and the parties to the transaction.
In regard to the State, as to his associates in the matter of the
subscriptions, the plaintiff held a two-fold relation; and the fact
that he agreed to accept for his thirteen bonds a certain compromise, can scarcely be said to afford an implication, incapable of
refutation, that he abandoned his claim under the two other
bonds. Nor do we perceive that his surrender of thirteen bonds,
and payment of $1,300 toward the completion of the canal, was
inconsistent with his retaining and insisting on his lien for the
other two bonds of a different class.
It is unnecessary, however, to pursue this branch of the
inquiry farther, because we are satisfied that neither the Act of
1846, nor the supplementary Act of 1847, were in anywise
intended to destroy the priority of lien which belonged to the
Wabash and Erie Canal bonds, so called. This phrase is applied
in the Act of 1847, to the bonds issued under the Acts of 1832,
1834, 135, and the $500,000 issued under the 10th section of
the Act of 1836. In all of those Acts, except that of 1835, the
canal was pledged as security for the bonds, and the State
guaranteed the sufficiency of the security. In section eight of
the Act of 1846, in which the power is given to the Governor to
conveyr the canal to the trustees, and which also goes on to provide in five distinct sub-sections, for the order of payment out
of the canal fund, there is this very clear and explicit de
claratioi\: After describing the manner of conveyance, and what
is to be conveyed, including the canal and all its resources, these
words are added: "Subject, nevertheless, to all existing rights
and equities against the State on account of the same, or any
part thereof, or liabilities of the State growing out of or in relation thereto."
In the supplemental Act of 1847, section 10, the order of distribution of the funds arising from the canal resource is some.

what changed, but after the ninth and last paragraph on that
subject there is this language:
"And it is hereby declared, that such sums shall from time to
time be paid and applied as soon as conveniently may be after
the receipt thereof, saving the just rights of the holders of bonds nou
3utstanding,known as the Wabash and Erie Canal bonds a- 'provided in the eighth section of this Act."
We cannot resist the conviction that these provisions were
intended to preserve the lien which the bond-holders of this
class had, notwithstanding the transfer of the canal to other
hands, for other purposes. The bonds for which the State had
guaranteed that the canal was a sufficient security, certainly
constituted an "existing right and equity against the State," on
account of the canal, and a "liability of the State growing out
of it." And no where more appropriately than in an Act transferring the canal to other hands, for other purposes, could the
State recognize distinctly the lien which it had created, and the
sufficiency of which it had guaranteed. What were the just
rights of holders of bonds outstanding and known as the Wabash
and Erie Canal bonds in January, 1847? Certainly, speaking
in reference to the canal fund, of which that Act was making a
disposition, their right was to have it appropriated to the payment of the accruing interest on these bonds, and the bonds themselves when due, according to their priority of lien. A very
Ingenious argument is made by the learned counsel for the
appellant, to show that these provisions were not intended to
apply to this lien, and we are referred to the case of the ,State.vs
Board of Trustees, (4 Ind. R., 495), to support that view. But
that case, as we understand it, decides nothing more, than that
the holder of one of these bouds who had surrendered it for a
canal stock certificate, had a right to have his interest paid out
of the funds arising from that part of the canal east of Tippecanoe
river, before it was appropriated to the completion of the canal
to Evansville, under the provision of the Act of 1846.
Our construction of these acts is supported by the facts that
the State could not destroy the lien if it had designed to do so,
that it was reasonable and just that she should protect a lien

Trustees of the Wabash and Erie 0aTel Company vs. Beers.
the sufficiency of which she had guaranteed, and that the plain
and natural import of the language used, justifies this interpretation of the legislative intent.
We are, therefore, of opinion, that the bonds on which plaintiff brought his suit, were a paramount lien on the canal, its
lands and revenues, from the mouth of Tippecanoe river to. the
east line of the State, and that said lien has not been impaired
by any Act of his, or of the State, and that the decree in his
favor was right on the meiits.
It is made a point in the case, that the bill should be dismissed
for want of proper parties.
The plaintiff brings his suit in behalf of himself, and all others
interested in the same issue of bonds. As we have already said,
there seems to be no other bonds, which are liens, outstanding,
but those of the issue of 1832, all the holders of which are made.
