JOHN SMITH

SUPREME COURT.

T., PLAINTIFF

V. ROBERT BELL, DEFENDANT,

The will of B. G. contained the following clause: "also, I give to my wife
Elizabeth Goodwin, all my personal estate whatsoever and wheresoever, and
of what nature, kind and quality ocvi-r, after payment of my debts, legacie.s
and funeral expenses, which personal-estate I give ijd bequeath unto my said
wife, Elizabeth Goodiin, to and for her own use and dispoal ahsolutely: the
remainder after her decease to be for the use of the said Jesse Goodwin," th
son of the testator. Jesse Goodwin took a vested remainder in the personal
estate, which came into possession after the death of Elizabeth Goodwin.
In this case it is impossible to mistake the intent. The testator unquestionably
intended to make a present provision for his wife, and a future provision for
his son. The intention can be defeated only by expunging or rendering totally inoperative the last clause of the will. In doing so, a long series of opinions, making the intention of the testator the polar star to guide in the cunstruction of wills, must be disregarded, because we find words which indicate
an intention to permit the first taker to use part of the estate bequeathed
The first and gieat rule in the exposition of wills, to which all
rules must bend,
is, that the intention of the testator expressed in his will shall prevail, provided
it be consistent with the rules of law. This piinciple is generally asserted in
the construction of every testamentary disposition. It is emphatically the will
of the person who makes it, and is defined to be "the legal declaration of a
man's intentions, which he wills to be performed after his death." These intentions are to be collecte d from his words; and ought to be carried intoeffect
if they be consistent with law.
In the construction of ambiguous expressions, the situation of the parties may
very properly be taken into view. The ties which connect the testator with
his legatees, the affection subsisting between them, the motives which may
reasonably be supposed to operate with him, and to influence him in the disposition of his property, are all
entitled to consideration in expounding doubtful words, and ascertaining the meaning in which the testator used them.
The rule that a remainder may be limited after a life estate in personal property,
is as well settled as any other principle of our law. The attempt to create
such limitation is not opposed by the policy of the law, or by any of its rules.
If the intention to create such limitation is manifested in a will, the courts
will sustain it.
It is stated in many cases that where there are two intents, inconsistent with
each other, that which is primary will control that which is secondary.
Notwithstanding the reasonableness and good sense of the general rule, that the
intention shall prevail, it has been sometimes disregarded. If the testator attempts to affect that which the law forbids, his will must 3ield to the rules of
law; but courts have sometimes gone further. The construction put upon
words in one will has been supposed to furnish a rule for construirig the same
words in other wills; and thereby to furnish some settled and fixed rules of
construction, which ought to be respected. We cannot say this principle
ought to be totally disregarded; but it should never be carried so far as to defeat the plain intent, if that intent may be carried into execution without violating the rules of law. It has been said truly, " that

us to general rules of construction, but unless a case cited be in every respect
directly in point, aud agree in every circumstance, it will have little or no
weight with the court, who always look upon the intention of the testator as
the polar star to direct them in the construction of wills."

THlIS case came before the court on a certificate of division
in opinion of the judges of the circuit court of the United
States for the eastern district of Tennessee.
In the circuit court, John Smith T. instituted an action of
trover against Robert Bell for the recovery of the value of
certain negroes named and described in the declaration. The
defendant pleaded not guilty, upon which plea issue was
joined.
The facts of the case were agreed by the parties, and the
plaintiff moved the court for judgment for two thousand-six
hundred and fifteen dollars and sixty-two and a half cents, the
agreed value of the negroes; if the court should be of opinion
that thte plaintiff was entitled to recover.
Upon the case agreed the following questions arose, upon
which the judges of the court were divided, and the division
was cui tified to this court: whether by the will of Britain B.
Goodwin, Elizabeth Goodwink had an absolute title to the peruual cstate of Britain B. Goodwin, or only a life estate: and
aide whether Jesse Goodwin, the son of Britain B. Goodwin,
by said will, had a vested remainder that would come into
possession on the death of said Elizabeth; or was said remainder void.
The facts of the case agreed were as follow:
That Britain B. Goodwin, a citizen of the state of Tennessee,
and resident in the district of East Tennessee, did, on the
17th day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and ten, make and execute his last will and
testament, in the words and figures following, to wit: " In
the name of God, amen. I, Britain B. Goodwin, of the state
of Tennessee, and county of Roane, yeoman, being mindful
of my mortality, do, this 17th day of October, in the year
of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ten, and thirtyfifth year of independence of the United States of America,
do make and publish this my last will and testament, in inanner following: First, I desire to be decently buried in the
place 'where I shall happen to die; also, I give and bequeath

SUPREME COURT.

one feather bed, to be delivered to him by my executrix after
my decease; also, I give to my wife, Elizabeth Goodwin, all
my personal estate whatsoever, and wheresover, and of what
nature, kind, and quality soever, after payment of my debts,
legacies, and funeral expenses; which personal estate, I give
and bequeath unto my said wife, Elizabeth Goodwin, to and
for her own use and benefit and disposal absolutely: the remainder of said estate, after her decease, to be for the use of
the said Jesse Goodwin: and I do hereby constitute and ap.

my last will and testament.
In witness whereof, T have hereunto set my hand and seal,

his
BRITAIN B. + GOODWIN [L. s.].
mark
The foregoing will is duly witnessed, proved, and recorded.
Itis further agreed, that said Britain B. Goodwin departed this
life in the month of October 1811; that his wife, the said Elizabeth Goodwin, named in the foregoing will, took into her
possession all the personal estate of said Britain B. Goodwin,
under the bequest in said will to her, and retained the same
until the month of November in the year of our Lord one
thousand eight hundred and thirteen, when she intermarried
with Robert Bell, the defendant in this suit; that she and
Robert Bell kept the possession of said personal estate till the
latter part of the year 1826, when the said Elizabeth Goodwin
died. Said Robert Bell has kept the possession of said personal estate ever since, claiming the same as his own, under
the bequest in said will to his said wife Elizabeth;. among
which are the following named negroes, to.wit: Lucy, aged
about forty-five; Jack, aged about twenty-six; Sophia, aged
about twenty-four; Harry, aged about twenty-one; Alexander,
agea about nineteen; and Ned, aged about thirteen; which
said negroes are admitted to be of the value of two thousand
three hundred and twenty-five dollars; which sum, with interest thereon from the Ist day of September 1827, at which
time said negroes were demanded of defendant by plaintiff's
agent; and it is agreed the said sum and interest would amount

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Smith v. Bell.'

to two thousand six hundred and fifteen dollars sixty-two and
a half cents, which last sum is sought by plaintiff to be recovered of defendant in this action of trover. It is further agreed,
that said Jesse Goodwin, the person named in the will of Britain B. Goodwin, did, in due form, execute to John Smith T.,
the plaintiff, the following bill of sale, to wit: c I have sold to
John Smith T. all my right, title, interest, and claim to the
estate of my father, Britain B. Goodwin; and I do hereby authorize the said John Smith T. to bring whatever suit or suits
may be necessary to recover all of the property I am or may
be entitled to from the said estate; to act in all cases as he, the
said John, may think proper, and to convert the property he
may recover to his own proper fise, and give any receipts or
acquittances in my name which may be necessary, hereby
vesting the before named John Smith T. with all the power I
could use in my own proper person, were I personally present; for value received.
Witness my hand and seal this 31st day of March 1815.
JESSE GOODWIN [L. s.].".
Said bill of sale has been duly proved and. registered, in
pursuance of the statute of th6 state of Tennessee in such cases
made and provided.
The case was argued by Mr Key for the plaintiff, with
whom also was Mr Grundy: no counsel appeared for the defendant.
It was contended for the plaintiff, that in this, as in all cases
'of wills, such a construction is to be given as will carry into
effect all the intentions of the testator; such as will give meaning and force to all the words of the will. A construction
which will make some of the words senseless, and some of the
provisions nugatory, ought to be rejected.
Here the difficulty arises from the words "to and for her
own use and benefit, and dispopal absolutely.5 ' They are
thought to be added to show the extent of the wife's interest,
and to describe her right to the property; and that, thus giving her an absolute and entire interest in the things, there is
nothing left; no 4remainder" for the son; and that the sucdeeding bequest to him is therefore void.
If these words were out of the will, the case would be a

SUPREME COURT.
[Smith v. Bell.]

clear one for the son; as in 12 Wheat. 568, where an absolute
bequest of slaves is qualified by a subsequent limitation over.
Do these words, then, necessarily purport to define the extent of the wife's interest? If any other meaning can be given
to them, this should not be, because they would thus be made
tautological and senseless. The term "give" used before,
implies all 'his. It is making the testator say over again what
he had, already said in this word, and would make some of
the words of the will useless; and to assign this meaning to
them, annuls the provision immediately succeeding in favour
of the son.
It has been a frequent practice to adopt this mode of reasoning in the construction of wills; and to give another meaning
to the words used by a testator, by the mere force of a succeeding provision in the instrument. This was done in the
case cited from 12 Wheat. 568: so also in case of a fee-simple
limited to a fee-t,il, the word "heirs" has been construed to
mean children. 2 Ves. 501; 1 Bro. C. R. 489; 8 Ves. 22.
This mode of construction has been employed in order to use
all the words of a will. The previous words are to be restrained and qualified by those used subsequently; and the subsequent words are to be more regarded, if they are in conflict
with the previous- language of the instrument. Chief Justice
Parsons in Dawes v. Swann, 4 Mass. 208. May not, then,
another meaning be given them? If susceptible of such, they
ought to have it.
The testator had given the property by positive words; and
he then inserts this parenthesis-not to describe what he had
done, which was not necessary, but to do something which
he thought he had omitted: to point out the mode, not the
extent, In which his wife was to enjoy the property. It was
to be "for her own use and benefit and disposal absolutely:"
meaning that she should be uncontrolled in its enjoyment, unaccountable, not to be interfered with by him in remainder;
or that it was to be her separate estate, not to be divested or affected by her future coverture. "At her disposal" makes it her
separate property. Cited Bradley v. Westcott, 13 Ves. 445;
5 Maddock, 491; 7 Vin. Ab. 95, pl. 43. Or these words may
mean the intention of the testator that the legatee should have

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Smith v. Bell.]

the property for her support. "Use and benefit" are equivalent terms to support.
Here the son is to have something, and therefore the wife
of the testator was not to have all. He is to have the "remainder;" the remainder at the decease of the wife: that
would be, what she'had not used or disposed of for her support, or her benefit. During her life, the wife was to have
the use of the property; at her death he is to have that which
might remain, after her full enjoyment of all the benefits of
the bequest. 1 P. Wms, 655; 1 Bro. C. R. 489; 2 Ves. 501.
The testator's meaning sufficiently appears from the whole
will. His first purpose was to provide for his wife as long as
she lived, as far as might be necessary; to the whole extent of
his means. For this end he uses the language, to her ",use
and benefit, and disposal absolutely." His second object was
to provide for his son; and he gave him the "remainder" of
the property, after the decease of his wife. What remainder?
What his wife might have after supporting herself during her
life. If the use of the property should be found insufficient,
she might dispose of it absolutely.
Although she had a right to dispose of the property absolutely, her marriage with the defendant, Robert Bell, was not
such a disposal as was contemplated by the will. The husband took the property as the legatee held it; subject to the
remainder of the son, if not necessary to be disposed of for the
use of the wife.
Nor should it be urged, that as nothing is said about the
subsistence of the legatee, the interpleader which is claimed
for the plaintiff will not be allowed. This was plainly implied; the intention of the testator is equally clear with that
in the case cited. The nature of the property was such as
to furnish an income to the wife, and to produce the means of
her support and maintenance.
The gift of the "remainder" clearly shows that the testator meant there should be a remainder, after the use of the
property by his wife; if there should be any remainder consistently with his wife's support until her decease. He intended to give his son what should then be left-what should
"remain" of the propeity which she had enjoyed during
life. He intended to give the legatee the "use," "benefit,"
VOL. VI.-K

SUPREME COURT.
[Smith v. Bell.]

and "disposal" of the negroes for all the purposes of the bequest, her support. She was not allowed to will the property away; she was allowed to dispose of it during her life;
not at her death; because it was given to'her for the support
of her life.
Neither did the legatee, the wife of Britain B. Goodwin,
or her husband, dispose of the property. It now remains in
kind, as at the decease of the testator; and as such is claimed
by the son.
The words of Xhe will also indicate a limitation of the property, provided the use and benefit of the same should not be
interfered with by such limitation. By giving the remainder
after the decease of the legatee, the testator declared that it
should not be disposed of at her death; thus qualifying the
general words to a use, benefit and disposal during her life,
which is equivalent to saying in express terms, that the use and
benefit should be during life only.
If it is argued that such property might be consumed in the
use, and therefore there can be no remainder limited in it: it
is answered that the modern cases show that even after a life
estate or interest in consumable things, such a remainder inay
be given. 3 Yes. 311; 1 Roper on Legacies, 209.
Mr Chief Justice MARSEAiL delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case is adjourned to this court from the court of the
United States for the seventh circuit and district of East Tennessee, on a point on which the judges of that court were divided in opinion.

against the defendant, for several slaves in his declaration mentioned. He claimed the slaves under the following clause in
the will of Britain B. Goodwin: "also, I give to my-wife,
Elizabeth Goodwin, all my personal estate whatsoever and
wheresoever, and of what nature, ldnd and quality soever,
after payment of my debts, legacies -and funeral expenses,
which personal estate I give and bequezth unto my said wife,
Elizabeth Goodwin, to and for her own use and benefit, and
dispbsal absolutely; the remainder of the said estate after her
decease, to be for the use of the said Jesse Goodwin."

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Smith v. Bell.]

Elizabeth Goodwin took the estate of the testato" into her
possession, and intermarried with Robert Bell, the defendant.
After which the said Jesse Goodwin sold his interest therein
to the plaintiff, who, after the death of Elizabeth,' instituted
this suit. Upon the trial the following questions occurred, on
which the judges were divided in opinion: "c whether, by the
will of said Britain B. Goodwin, said Elizabeth Goodwin had
an absolute title to the personal estate of said Britain B. Goodwin, or only a life estate; and also, whether said Jesse Goodwin, by said will, had a vested remainder that would come
into possession on the death of said Elizabeth," or was said remainder void?"
The first and great rule in the exposition of wills, to which
all other rules must bend, is, that the intentioi, of the testator
expressed in his will shall prevail, provided it be consistent
with the rules of law. Doug. 322; 1 Black. Rep. 672. This
principle is generally asserted in the construction of every testamentary disposition. It is emphatically tle will of the person who makes it, and is defined to be "the legal declaration
of a man's intentions, which he wills to be performed after
his death."
2 Black. Com. 499. These intentions are to be
collected from his words, and ought to be carried into effect if
they be consistent with law.
In the construction of ambiguous expressions, the situation
of the parties may very properly be taken into view. The
ties which connect the testator with his legatees, the affection
subsisting between them, the motives which may reasonably
be supposed to operate with him, and to influence him in the
disposition of his property, are all entitle to consideration in
expounding doubtful words, and ascertainitig the meaning in
which the testator used them.
In the will under consideration, but two persons are mentioned-a wife and a son. The testator attempts, in express
words, to make a provision for both out of the same property.
The provision for the wife is immediate, that for the son is to
take effect after her death. The words of the *ill make both
provisions, but it is doubted whether both can have effect. In
the first member of the sentence he says, cc I give to my wife,
Elizabeth Goodwin, all my personal estate whatsoever and
wheresoever, and of what nature, kind and quality soever,

SUPREME COURT.
[Smith v. Bell.]

after payment of my debts, legacies and funeral expenses;
which personal estate I give and bequeath unto my said wife,
Elizabeth Goodwin, to and for her own use and benefit and
disposal absolutely."
It must be admitted that words could fiot have been employed which would be better fitted to give the whole personal
estate absolutely to the wife; or which would more clearly
express that intention. But the testator proceeds: "the remainder of said estate, after her decease, to be for the use of
the said Jesse Goodwin." Jesse Goodwin was his son.
These words give the"remainder of the estate, after his wife's
decease, to the son, with as much clearness as the preceding
words give the whole estate to his wife. They manifest the
intention of the testator to make a future provision for his son,
as clearly as the first part of the bequest manifests his intention
to make an immediate provision for his wife. If the first bequest is to take effect accoiding to the obvious import of the
words taken alone, the last is expunged from the will. The
operation of the whole clause will be precisely the same as if
the last member of the sentence were stricken out; yet both
clauses are equally the words of the testator, are equally binding, and equally claim the attention of those who may construe
the will. We are no more at liberty to disregard the last
member of the sentence than the first. No rule is better settled, than that the whole will is to be taken together, and is to
be so construed as to give effect, if it be possible, to the whole.
Either the last member of the sentence must be totally rejected,
or it must influence the construction of the first so as to restrain. the natural meaning of its words: either the bequest to
the son must be stricken out, or it must limit the bequest to
the wife, and confine it to her life. The limitation in remainder, shows that, in the opinion of the testator, the previous
words had given only an estate for iife. This was the sense
in which he used them.
It is impossible to read the will- without perceiving a clear
intention to give the personal estate to, the son after the death
of his mother. "The remainder of the said estate, after her
decease, to be for the use of the said Jesse Goodwin." Had
the testator been asked whether he intended to give any thing

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Smith v. Bell.]

by this bequest to his son, the words of the clause would have
answered the question in as plain terms as our language affords.
If we look to the situation of the parties, to the motives
which might naturally operate on the testator, to the whole
circumstances, so far as they appear, in the case; we find every,
reason for supporting the intention, which the words, giving
effect to all, of themselves import.
The only two objects of the testator's bounty, were his wife
and his son. Both must have been dear to him. The will
furnishes no indication of his possessing any land. His personal estate was probably small, too s malio to be divided. It
appears to have consisted of a negro woman and four others,
probably her children. Their relative ages, which are stated
in the plafintiff's declaration, would indicate that. the woman
was the mother of the other four. A sixth is sued for, but he
was not born at the death of the testator. The value of the
other articles, which constituted his personal estate, is not
mentioned, but it was probably inconsiderable. Farmers and
planters, having no real estate, and only five slaves-a woman
and four children, have rarely much personal estate in addition
to their slaves. The testator was not in a condition to make
any present provision for an only child, without lessening that
he wished to make for his wife. He therefore gives to his son
only a horse and one feather bed. The residue is given to his
wife.
What feelings, what wishes might be supposed to actuate a
husband and a father, having so little to bestow on a wife and
child he was about to leave behind him? His affections would
prompt him to give something to both. He could not be insensible to the claims of either. But if his property would
not, in his opinion, bear immediate division, the only practiable mode of accomplishing his object, would be to give a
present interest to one, and a future interest to the other. All
his feelings would prompt him to make, as far as was in his
power, a comfortable provision for his wife during her lifer
and for his child after her decease. This he has attempted to
do. No principle in our nature could prompt him to give his
property to the future husband of his wife, to the exclusion of
his only child. Every consideration, theh, suggested by the
relation of the parties and the circumstances of the case, comes

SUPREME COURT.
(Smith v. Bell.]

in aid of that construction which would give effect to the last
as well as first clause in the will; which would support the bequest of the remainder to the son, as well as the bequest to the
wife. It is not possible to doubt that this was the intention of
the testator.
Is this intention controverted by any positive rule of law?
Has the testator attempted to do that which the law forbids?
The rule that a remainder may be limited, after a life estate
in personal property, is as well settled as any other principle
of our law. The attempt to create such limitation is not opposed by the policy of the law, or by any of its rules. If the
intention to create such limitation is manifested in a will, the
courts will sustain it. Some other rule of law then must bear
on the case, or the intention will prevail.
It is stated in many cases, that where there are two intents
inconsistent with eachi other, that which is primary Will control that which is secondary: but the intent to provide for the
wife during life, is not' inconsistent with the intent to provide
for the son, by giving him the same property after her decease.
The two intents stand very well together, and are consistent;
as well with the probable intention, as with the words of the
testator. The intention'to give the personal estate absolutely
to the wife, is, it is true, inconsistent with the intention to
give it after her decease to his son; but which of them is the
primary intent? which ought to control the other? If we are
governed by the words, if we endeavour to give full effect to
them all, or if we are influenced by the relation of the parties,
and the motives which probably governed in making the will,
no such inconsistent intentions exist: but if they do exist, we
perceive no motive for ascribing any superior strength to that
which would provide for those who might claim the estate of
the wife after her decease; to that which would provide, after
her decease, for the only child of the testator.
To create these inconsistent intentions-this intention to do,
in limiting this remainder, what the policy of the law forbids,
the bequest to the wife must be construed to give her the power
to sell or consume the whole personal estate during her life;
which is totally incompatible with a gift of what remains at
her death. The remainder, after such a bequest, is said to be
void for uncertainty.

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Smith v. Bell.]

As this construction destroys totally the legacy, obviously
intended for the son by his father, it will not be made unless
it be indispensable. No effort to explain the words in a different sense, can do so much violence to the clause, as the total
rejection of the whole bequest, given in express terms to an
only son.
The first part of the clause which gives the personal estate
to the wife, would undoubtedly, if standing alone, give it to
her absolutely. But all the cases admit that a remainder limited on such a bequest would be valid, and that the wife would
take only for life. The difficulty is produced by the subsequent words. They are "which personal estates I give and
bequeath unto my said wife, Elizabeth Goodwin, to and for
her own use and benefit, and disposal absolutely." The operation of these words, when standing alone, cannot be questioned. But suppose the testator had added the words ";during
her life." These words would have restrained those which
preceded them; and have limited the use and benefit, and the
absolute disposal given by the prior words, to the use and benefit, and to a disposal for the life of the wife. 13 Yes. 444.
The words then are susceptible of such limitation. It may be
imposed on them by other words. Even the words "disposal
absolutely" may have their absolute character qualified by
restraining words, connected with, and explaining them to
mean, such absolute disposal as a tenant for life may make.
If this would be true, provided the restraining words "for her
life" had been added, why may not other equivalent words,
others which equally manifest the intent to restrain the estate
of the wife to her life, be allowed the same operation. Tie
words "the remainder of said estate, after her decease, to be
for the use of the said Jesse Goodwin," are, we think, equivalent. They manifest with equal clearness the intent to limit
the estate given to her, to her life, and ought to have the same
effect. They are totally inconsistent with an estate in the
wife, which is to endure beyond her.life.
Notwithstanding the reasonableness and good sense of this
general rule, that the intention shall prevail, it has been some
times disregarded. If the testator attempts to effect that which
the law forbids, his will must yield to the rules of law. But

SUPREME COURT.
[Smith v. Bell.]

courts have sometimes gone farther. The construction put
upon words in one will, has been supposed to furnish a rule
for construing the same words in other wills; and thereby to
furnish" some settled and fixed rules of construction which
ought to be respected.
'Wecannot say that this principle ought to be totally disregarded; but it should never be carried so far as to defeat the
plain intent; if that intent may be carried into execution without violating the rules of law. It has been said truly, 3 Wils.
141, "1that cases on wills may guide us.to general rules of
construction; but, unless a case cited be in every respect directly in point, and agree in every circumstance, it will have
little or no weight with the court, who always look upon the
intention of the testator as the polar star to direct them in the
construction of wills."
In Porter v. Tournay, 3 Ves. 311, Lord Alvanley declared
his opinion to be, "that a gift for life, if specific, of things qum
ipso usu consumuntur, is a gift of the property; and that there
cannot be a limitation after a life interest in such articles." In
the case of Randall v. Russell, 3 Mer. 190, the master of the
rolls inclines to the same opinion. But these cases do not
turn on the construction of the wills, but on the general policy
of the law in cases where the legacy is of articles where "the
use and the property can have no separate existence."
One of the strongest cases in which the court of chancery
has decided that the legatee first named took absolutely, though
there was a limitation in remainder, is that of Bule v. Kingston, 1 Mer. 314.
Ann Ashby, by her will, gave the sum of fifteen hundred
pounds, bank annuities, to John Earl Talbot, his executors,
&c. in trust for her sister Charlotte Williams for her separate
use; and "all other sums that may be due'to her," she left in
trust with the said John Earl Talbot for the use of her said
sister: "what I have not otherwise disposed of, I give to my
said sister the unlimited right of disposing of by will, excepting to E. P. &c.; and in case my said sister dies without a will,
I give all that may remain of my fortune at her decease to my
godson William Ashby. The rest and residue of my fortune
I give to my sister Charlotte Williams, making her the sole
executrix of this my last will and testament."

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Smith v. Bell.]

Charlotte Williams made a will, by which she appears to
have disposed of the whole of her own estate, but not to have
executed the power contained in the will of Ann Ashby. What
remained of her estate was claimed by the representative of
the husband, who survived his wife, Charlotte Williams; and
also by William Ashby, under the bequest to him of what
might remain at the decease of Charlotte Williams; if she
should die without a will. The master of the rolls being of
opinion that the whole vested in Charlotte Williams, decided
in favour of the representative of her husband, and that the
bequest to William Ashby was void.
In support of this decree it might be urged that, as the remainder to William Ashby was limited on the event of her
sister dying without a will, which event did not happen, the
remainder could not take effect. Or, which is stronger ground,
that the whole will manifests an intention to give every thing
to her sister; and that the eventual limitation in favour of William Ashby, accompanied as it is by various explanatory provisions, does not show such an intention in his' favour as to
defeat the operation of the clauseg in favour of Charlotte Williams, which show a superior solicitude to provide for her.
The testatrix gives to her sister the unlimited right of disposing of whatever may not have been bequeathed by herself,
thereby enabling her to. defeat the contingent remainder to
William Ashby; and then gives to her sister all the rest and
residue of her fortune. The sister is obviously, on the face of
the whole will taken together, the favourite legatee; and no
violence is done to the intention, by giving to bequests to her
their full effect, uncontrolled by the contingent remainder to
William Ashby.
But the master of the rolls does not place his decree on this
ground, and we must understand it as he understood it himself.
He says, it is impossible to make sense of the will, if, the
residuary clause is to be taken as distinct from what goes before it. "It is evident the testatrix perceived a defect in her
intended disposition of the entire property in favour of Mrs
Williams, And that she had only given a power where she
meant to give the absolute interest. To supply that defect she
gives the residue by the clause in question; and then the will

[Smith v.Bell.]

is to be read as if it stood thus:-' I give to Charlotte Williams the residue of my estate, together with the right of disposing of the same by will, except to E. P.; and if she dies
without a will, then I give whatever may remain at her death
to William Ashby.' She gives to Charlotte Williams, as a
married woman, the right of disposing by will of the property
vested in her, independently of the control of her husband,
and she intended at the same time, that if any thing was left
undisposed of by her, it should go to William Ashby. But
this is an intention that must fail on account of its uncertainty.
Charlotte therefore took the absolute interest in the prb,serty," &c.
This opinion is not so carefully expressed as to remove all
doubts respecting its real meaning, and to show precisely
whether the uncertainty which destroyed the validity of the
remainder belonged to all cases in which property was given
in general terms, with a power to use it and to dispose of it;
or belonged to those cases only in which analogous circumstances were found. The master of the rolls admits that the
testatrix intended to dispose of the entire property in favour
of Mrs Williams, but perceived that she had only given a
power, where she meant to give the absolute interest. In
speaking afterwards of the right given to Charlotte Williams
of disposing by will, he says, it is ; of the property vested in
her independent of the control of her husband."
The whole opinion furnishes strong reason to believe that
the master of the rolls considered himself as pursuing the
intention of the testatrix in declaring the remainder void, and
that Charlotte Williams took absolutely. It would be difficult,
we think, to support the proposition, that a personal thing, not
consumed by the use, could not be limited in remainder after
a general bequest to a person in being, with a power to use
ard even dispose of it; provided the whole will showed a clear
intention to limit the interest of the.first-taker to his life.
In Upwell v. Halsey, 1 P. W. 651, the testator directs
"9that such part of his estate as his wife should leave of her
subsistence should return to his sister and the heirs o'f her
body." The court observed, " as to what has been insisted
on, that the wife had a power over the capital or principal
sum; that is true, provided it had been necessary for her sub-

[Smith v. Bell.]

sistence, not otherwise; so that her marriage was not a gift in
law of this trust money. Let the master see how much of
this personal estate has been applied for the wife's subsistence;
and for the residue of that which came to the defendant, the
second husband~s hands, let him account."
This decree is founded on the admission, that in a case in
which the first taker might expend an uncertain part of the
thing given, a remainder might be limited. The uncertainty
of the sum whiqh might remain, formed no objection. The
cases are numerous in which the intent has controlled express
words.
In the case of Cowper v. Earl Cowper, 2 P. W. 720, several questions were discussed, which arose on the will of Robert
Booth; one of which was founded on a bequest of money to
Mr Samuel Powell, to be laid, out in lands, to be settled " in
trust for and to the use of my son and daughter, William Cowper, Esquire, and Judith his wife, for the term of their lives,
and after the decease of my daughter, then to the child or children," &c. It became a question of some importance whether
the limitation over took effect on the death of the daughter, or
on the death of the husband, who survived her. The master
of the rolls was of opinion, that it took effect on the death of
the wife, being of opinion that the express words giving the
estate to both for their joint lives, though always adjudged to
carry the estate to the survivor, were restrained to the wife
by the subsequent words which give the remainder "after the
decease of his daughter." "If the latter words be not so
taken, they must," he says, "be totally rejected."
After reviewing the various decisions on the effect of such
limitations, he adds, 'so in our case, the words subsequent to
the limitation, ' and after the decease of my daughter to the
child or children,' &c., show the testator's intert, and must
determine the effects of the limitation, especially in a will,
where the intent overrules the legal import of the words; be
they never so express and determinate."
In finding this intent every word is to have its effect. Every
word is to be taken according to the natural and common import; but whatever may be the strict grammatical construction
of the words, that is not to govern, if the intention of the tes-

SUPREME COURT
[Smith Y.Bell.j

tator unavoidably requires a different construction.

The court said in Sims v. Doughty, 5 Ves. 247, "and if two
parts of the will are totally irreconcileable I know of no rule
but by taking the subsequent words.as an indication of a subsequent intention."
Blackstone, in his Commentaries, Vol. II..380, asserts the
same principle. The approved doctrine, however, unquestionably is, that they should, if possible, be reconciled, and the
intention be collected from the whole will.
In the case before the court, it is, we thiak, impossible to
mistake the intent. The testator unquestionably intended to
make a present provision for his wife, and a future provision
for his son. This intention can be defeated only by expunging, or rendering totally inoperative, the last clause of the will.
In doing so, we must disregard a long series of opinions, mak-,
ing the intention of the testator the polar star to guide us in
the constructioh of wills, because we find words which indicate an intention to permit the first taker to use part of the
estate bequeathed.
This suit is brought, for slaves,-a species of property not
consumed by the use, and in which a remainder may be limited after a life esiate. They composed a part, and probably
the most important part, of the personal estate given to the
wife 4Lo and for her own use and benefit, and/disposal absolutely." But in this personal estate, according to the usual
condition of persons in the situation of the testator, there were
trifling and perishable articles, such as the stock on a farm,
household furniture, and the crop of the year, whiich would be
consumed in the use; and over which the exercise of absolute
ownership was necessary to a full enjoyment. These may
have been in the mind of the testator when he employed the
strong words of the bequest to her. But be this as it may,
we think the limitation tothe son on the death of the wife rdstrains and limits the preceding words so as to confine the
power of absolute disposition, which they purport to confer
of the slaves, to such a disposition of-them as may be made
by a person having only a life estate in them. This opinion
is to be certified to the circuit court.

[Smith v. Bell.)

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States for the district of East Tennessee, and on the points and 4uestions on
which the judges of the said circuit court were opposed in
opinion, and which were certified to this Court for its opinion,
agreeably to the act of congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel on the part of the plaintiff;
on consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, that Elizabeth Goodwin took only a life estate, by the will of Britain B.
Goodwin, in the slaves belonging to the personal estate of the
said Britain B. Goodwin, and that Jesse Goodwin had, by said
will, a vested remainder in the said slaves that would come
into possession on the death of the said Elizabeth. All of
which is hereby ordered and adjudged to be certified to the
said circuit court as the opinion of this Court.
