The casc of Gait et al.

APPEAL from the circuit court of the United, States for the
district of Ohio.
This case was argued by Messrs Vinton and Doddridge, for
the appellants; and by Messrs Corwin and Bibb, for the appellees.
Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered tk 6pinion of theCourt.
This suit was brought in the court of the United States for
the seventh circuit, and district of Ohio, to obtain a,convey-,
anee for land which the defendants hold by a senior patent,
and which the plaintiffs claim under a prior entry. The bill
was dismissed by the circuit court, and the plaintiffs hav appealed to this court
Serious doubts exist respecting the, validity of the entry
under which the claim has been made, and several points have
been discuSsed at the bar. It is unnecessary to d'ecide morethan one of these questions, because that is decisive of the
case. David Ander.on, in whose name the entry under which
the. plaintiffs claim was made, was dead at the time. The
entry, therefore, as was determined in Galt and others v. Galloway, 4 Peters, 332, 345, is, in the state of Ohio 7 a nullity.
This being the foundation of the plaintiffs' title, they must fail.
in their action.
Counsel at the bar have endeavoured to distinguish this case
from that, by treating the entry as one made in the name of
the wrong persorr, through the mistake of the surveyor.
We do not think he is sustained by the fact or the law of
the case. The decree is affirmed with costs.
