JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

KEMPNER V. CHURCHILL.
A sale of personal property, made much below its cost, by a man indebted
to near or quite the extent of all he had, set aside as a fraud on creditors; it having been made within a month after the property was bought,
and before it was yet paid for; made, moreover, on Saturday, while the
account of stock was taken on Sunday (the parties being Jews), and the
property carried off early on Monday.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the District of Northern Illinois, in which court, Churchill and others, merchants
of New York, and judgment creditors of one Levison, filed
a bill against a certain Kempner (Levison being impleaded),
to set aside a purchase of a whole stock of dry goods which
the bill alleged that Kempner, confederating and colluding
with Levison how to cheat the complainant, and to hinder,
delay, and defraud the creditors of Levison, had proposed to
purchase, and had purchased of Levison, for a greatly inadequate consideration, to wit: for fifty-five cents on the dollar.
It appeared, from the testimony, that Levison, who kept
a clothing store in Chicago, and had, at the time, a stock of
clothes there, worth $6000, went on, about the middle of
March, 1866, to New York, where, according to the testimony, he enjoyed the reputation of "a responsible, paying,
first-class customer," and there laid in an additional quantity, which he purchased on credit, and which cost him
$11,622 more. The new goods were forwarded to Chicago;
and the whole stock thus cost $17,622. The circumstances
attending the sale were thus testified to by Levison:

"The sale was made on the 8th of April, 1866. I came back
from New York about the 22d of March, 1866. I was in Chicago
some few days; Mr. Kempner came in the store one day, shook
hands, and said he had an idea of going to Omaha to open business, and, if he could buy a cheap stock of goods, he would take

them up there; that was on Saturday, a week before the sale.
I told him I had a pretty good stock of goods here that I would
sell him, as I had a chance to go into something that would pay
me better than this business just now. :He said he would see,
and come in to-morrow with his brother-in-law, and look over
the goods, us he was a better judge of goods and prices than he
was. On the following day, he came in with David Adams, and
they did look over the stock, and he said he would go home and
think about it, and come in to-morrow and see me. The next
day, he came in and offered me fifty-five cents on the dollar. I
got pretty mad at that, and told him seventy cents would
not buy them, and went off and left him. A day or two afterwards, he came in again, and we had a talk, and he said the
goods were not worth more than that to him, and he had taken
advice withsome friends, who told him that goods were not worth
as much then as they were at the time I bought them, and my
credit was not very good in New York, so I had to pay ten or
fifteen per cent. more than any one else. He said he wanted to
make something on them; he would have to sell them on credit,
and wait for his money. I told him it was no such thing, that
I did not pay more than any one else; that he might go around
town and inquire, and *make himself familiar with the prices,
and he could find out. I told him it did not make any difference,
that that money would not buy them, and I expected to hear
from another gentleman in the country, who wanted to go into
business in Chicago, and I would, probably, sell out to him;
that ended the conversation that day. The next day, I think it
was. I met Mr. Kempner and asked him why he circulated the
reports around that he had offered me fifty-five cents, and that
I was going to sell out. He said he did not circulate any reports, but he would take me in and show me a good honest man,
who would tell me where those reports came from. I went in
with him to David Witowsky's fur store, on Lake Street;
Witowsky said he had heard reports, but could not tell where
they came from. We three stood and talked about the value of
the goods. I went out after a while and went home to the store.
In the afternoon, Mr. Kempner was passing by, and I called
him in. We had some talk there about business. He said to
me, 'There is some pretty rough talk in town about you ; you
had better not delay this matter; you had better let me have
the goods, and put the money in your pocket, and let the credit.

ors go to the devil,' or words to that effect. I told him I would
not sell them for that price anyway. He said, 'That is my
offer, and, if you can do any better, do it.' I told him I did
not see what I had to fear from the creditors; that I did not
owe any one anything that was due, except Freidlander. Steitch
& Co. He said, ' You had better look out for them, I know them
better than you do.' On Saturday, we came together again, in
the store, the 7th of April, 1866. I told him I wanted to close
the trade with him. I asked him to meet me half way in the
offer. I had offered them to him before for sixty-five cents;
either at this time or before he had offered me fifty-five cents.
Ile said, 'No; he would not give any more than fifty-five
cents.' Previous to that, I told him I would sell him the fixtures
in the store. He said he would not have them if he bought the
stock; that he would move the goods out of the store before he
paid for them, or that he would pay for them as soon as he had
them out of the store: I think the last were his words; that he
did not want to have any trouble with them, for fear the creditors might replevy them. We closed the trade on Saturday, and
be said he would come in on Sunday and take stock. On Sunday morning, he came in with David Witowsky, Jr., and David
Adams; I was there with Mr. Berk. Before we took stock, Mr.
Kempner and I had some conversation; he asked me how much
I owe( Freidlander, Steitch & Co. and several other parties. I
told him I owed Freidlander, Steitch & Co. a little over $3000,
and named over some other creditors, but I don't remember their
names, or the amounts I gave. He said, 'Little Coleman'
would have to suffer too. I told him I did not know that; I
only owed him a little over 820J, and I might pay that bill. We
then went to work and took stock. When we got through
taking stock, and we were starting for home, he said, ' You had
better give me the key of the store, so as to show that the goods
are in my possession.' I then gave him the key of the store,
and told him I must have the money for the goods by twelve
o'clock the next day. He said, you shall have it as soon as I
get the goods moved. On Monday morning, I came down to the
store about nine o'clock, or between nine and ten, and the goods
were already removed."
The fifty-five per cent. agreed on between the parties, gave
Levison $9725.
The bill of the goods sold was, however,

made out on the basis of the New York cost, $17,622, and
receipted accordingly. The goods were removed to a basement-story, or cellar, at some distance from the store (for
the purpose, as Kempner asserted, of saving storage); and
the $9725 paid in cash to Levison.
Levison in his answer given, as in his testimony, admitted the fraud. Rempner in his, denied all fraud on his
part, and represented himself as having come from California
with $12,000 in gold, his only fortune; that being in Chicago
he met Levison, who had also been in California, and whom
he had known there; that Levison urged him to buy him
out; that after several interviews, Levison sent for him and
accepted his offer of fifty-five cents for the dollar of cost, saying, "Well, you shall have them. I am sick of this business;
I want to be in some business in which I shall be occupied
all day long doing something." Kempner's answer further
asserted that he knew of no judgments or liens on the property, and that the purchase was n6t made to forestall or
delay Levison's creditors; and it denied the conversation
stated by Levison in which he, Rempner, was represented
as having urged Levison to make a sale and to disregard his
creditors. It asserted that the goods were worth nothing
like the cost price, and that the consideration paid was not
fraudulently below value, and it charged that the complainant's bill was filed in collusion and conspiracy with Levison,
to defraud Kempner, while he, Levison, was permitted to go
free, with the money paid him.
There was a great amount of testimony (the record having
had 260 pages) to show fraud. Much of it was not direct,
and some of it was more or less contradictory. Numerous
persons were examined to show that the cost price of the
goods was too high; but they failed to show that it was so
to the extent of forty-five per cent. or near it.
At the time of the sale Levison owed about $15,000. With
the cash that Kempner paid him he could show in money
and furniture about $13,000, owned by himself. His wife
had property.
As to the conspiracy alleged by Kempner between the

complainants and Levison, it appeared that the sale having
been made on the 9th, Levison was arrested on the 10th
upon the affidavit of a brother-in-law to one of the complainants; that on the 11th, complainant came to Chicago; that
he staid until the 14th; that while here he discharged the
warrant of arrest of Levison, and employed Levison's previously retained counsel, to collect his debt out of the goods
sold to Kempner; that on the 16th (Sunday intervening),
Levison confessed judgment to the complainants; that on
the 17th he confessed judgments to seven other of the creditors, now complainants, and on the same 17th April this bill
was filed as a creditor's bill, on executions returned unsatisfied as against Levison; that none of these demands weredue
at the time under three months, except one, which rested in
open account; that those judgments were confessed in the
office of Levison's attorneys; and, that the bill waived an
answer on oath.
The parties defendant were Jews.
The court below, on view of all the evidence, decreed the
sale fraudulent, and Kempner appealed.
Mr. S. A. Goodwin,for the appellant:
We charge that the bill has been filed by collusion between
the complainants and Levison, and we think that the dates
at which, and the circumstances wherein the judgments were
obtained show that.
B]t passing to the complainants' case, it is certain that
they must establish affirmatively, that the sale was fraudulently intended by Levison, and, as a fact, that Kempner
conspired with Levison to cheat and defraud the creditors
by having such sale made with the design of keeping the
merchandise beyond the reach of process of law; and that
the sale was in fact made for such purpose, that is to say, to
hinder and delay creditors.* These are the allegations of
their bill.

KEMPNER V. CHURCHILL.

Argument for the appellant.

The bonafides of the purchase by Kempner is affirmatively
established. Levison's whole indebtedness on the 9th of April,
1866, was within $15,000. He had fall $13,000 money and
chattels. The complainants do not allege nor show, nor did
Levison, as a witness, pretend that he had not notes, claims,
and choses in action, or other moneys to meet the balance of
$1100 in full. His wife had money. It is incumbent on the
complainants to show affirmatively that Levison was bankrupt, b'efore they can charge that the sale was fraudulent.
The complainants do not show anywhere in the case, that
Levison has not now, nor that he has not always had money
enough to pay these creditors all he owes. The answer
which the complainant's solicitors drew for him does not
deny that he has such money.
Kempner could not know of a fraudulent purpose which
Levison did not entertain, so far as shown, for he (Levison)
substantially negatives that. In the absence of that main
necessary fact, the complainants have attempted to prove
some remarks, which, if substantiated, they seem to suppose
would show Kempner cognizant of some wrong intention.
But they are all unsatisfactory for the conclusion, and every
one of them denied by Kempner and disproved. Besides,
if considered proved, they would not indicate knowledge or
intent on Kempner's part, that the money paid would not be.
applied to satisfy creditors. If the sale was honest and fair,
and for a fair price, it could make no difference that the
creditors might not be paid in full. Purchases are often
made of the stocks of insolvents, and rightly and honestly,
although such consequences necessarily ensue.
As to the value of the goods there is a difference of opinion,
but the preponderance is with the defendant. Inadequacy
of consideration is thus exploded, either as a badge of fraud
per se, or as amotive for a fraudulent collusion with Levison.
Kempner's purpose of going into trade was a legitimate one.
The right to sell was perfect in Levison, either at wholesale
or retail. The right to buy and make a good, or even a hard
bargain, cannot be denied to a purchaser, there being no
fraudulent conspiracy between vendor and vendee.

"KEMPNER V.

CHURCHILL.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for the appellant.

The debts of Levison were not due. No suit had been
commenced, or even threatened. Kempner could therefore
have had no design to place these goods beyond the reach
of an execution in behalf of these creditors. Levison's creditors bad no lien on them fixed or inchoate. Nor had they
begun, or threatened to begin any proceedings to mature a
lien. The full price paid put Levison in funds to pay his
creditors.
The Supreme Court of Illinois say, in Waddams v: Humphrey,*
"No matter how much a man may be indebted, he may sell his
property for a fair price, or even for a price below the market value,
if done honestly and with no view to delay, hinder, or defraud
creditors of their just dues. A debtor may sell his property for
a fair price, even if he sells it with the avowed intention of defeating an honest claim, if no lien exists to forbid it."
It was reasonable prudence for Kempner to remove the
goods at once into his own possession after the inventory
was made. Prompt possession has never before been urged
as a badge of fraud. On the contrary, possession left with
the vendor has always been considered ground of suspicion.t
It is idle to say that the possession was in haste to avoid
seizure by creditors. There was not only no such thing
threatened, but not one of Levison's creditors was in a position, legally, to touch these goods by attachment, replevin,
execution, or other process.
These parties were all Jews, and with them Sunday is
always a secular and convenient day for any extra work.
Will it be said that the receipt on the invoice of goods
sold, was taken for the whole sum fraudulently? The charge
is without foundation. All the parties connected with the
sale well knew the amount Kempner was to give. It was
openly and notoriously known, and talked about by near a
dozen witnesses. How then could Kempner expect to keep
it a secret by the form of the receipt?

KEMPNER V. CHURCHILL.
Opinion of the court.

Deeply as the law abhors fraud and crime, it equally abhors the imputation of either, except upon clear and dontrolling evidence. And the onus is therefore upon the
creditor who assails a sale to show the fraud which he relies on.
Levison's testimony is worth very little, situated as he is,
interested to pay his debts with property which he once
sold, while he keeps the $10,000 consideration-money in his
pocket, and proclaims his own turpitude.
Xlr. Gillet, contra.
Mr. Justice GRIER delivered the opinion of the court.

It has been frequently held that fraud ought not to be presumed, but must be proved. But the evidence of it is
almost always circumstantial. Nevertheless, though circumstantial, it produces conviction in the mind often of more
force than direct testimony.
It would be a troublesome, as well as an unprofitable task
to examine all the very astute arguments, founded on the
large mass of testimony contained in the record, to show
that the court below have come to a wrong conclusion. It
suffices to say that it sufficiently appears that the evidence
before'the court fully justified their conclusion.
It is true that mere inadequacy of consideration, unless
extremely gross, does not per se prove fraud. But the direct
testimony here confirms the fact that Kempner urged the
acceptance of his offer to purchase with arguments such as
this: "There is some pretty rough talk in town about you.
You had better not delay this matter. You had better let
me have the goods and put the money in your pocket, and
let the creditors go to the devil."
The circumstantial evidence amply confirms this direct

evidence of fraud.

AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.

MATTINGLY V. NYE.
1. The statute of 13 Eliz., ch. 5, which is in force in the District of Columbia, does not affect, in favor of subsequent creditors, a voluntary settlement made by a rTan, not indebted at the time, for his wife and children,
unless fraud was intended when the settlement was made. Sexton v.
Wheaton (8 Wheaton, 229; S. C. 1 American Leading Cases, 1), approved and affirmed.
2. A judgment for money due, at a certain time, against the party making
the settlement, is conclusive in respect to the parties to it. It cannot
be impeached collaterally, and it cannot be questioned upon a creditor's
bill.
APPEAL from the District of Columbia; the case being
thus:
N'ye, a man not very provident, bought a city lot of no
great value in Washington, with some money that he had,
and on the 25th June, 1857, had it conveyed in trust for his
wife and children, to one Harkness as trustee. The purchase and conveyance in trust was made, as it seems by
Harkness's own account of it, by Nye at the suggestion of
Harkness, " who, living in the neighborhood of Nye, and
having frequent opportunities of seeing the destitution and
need of the family, and the infirm and broken health of the
wife, interested himself in securing a home for herself and
children, proposed a conveyance by which the property
should be secured against the contingencies of any future
recklessness or want of care in the said Nye." On the 21st
July, 1860-that is to say a little more than three years after
this transaction-Nye obtained money of one Mattingly, a
person with whom he had had frequent money dealings, and
sometimes as it seemed at exorbitant rates (including some
dealings before the purchase), making, for the money now
got, an assignment of a certain claim, but whether in satis-
