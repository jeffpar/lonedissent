[Sup. Ct.

Syllabus.

undertaking of the State to receive the notes of the bank,
constituted a contract between the State and the holders of
the notes, which the State was not at liberty to lreak , and
that the tender of notes issued prior to the repealing act was
good. It was also held, that it made no diflerence whether
the debtor had the notes in his possession when the repealing act was passed or not.
It will thus be seen that lVoodr'uff v. T,.,pT/, and this
case, in all important features, are alike.
An attempt has been made to distinguish the cases, because in the Tennessee bank trust funds were embarked in
the enterprise ; but if the State thought proper to use them
il this manner, it took care to pledge its faith to supply any
deficiency that should arise through the mismanagement of
the bank. It is difficult to see how the employment of these
funds made the bank atty less a State institution, for it was
created expressly for the benefit of the State, who had the
exclusive management of it, and agreed to support it. But
if we eoneedc that the State did wrong in using these funds
in banking, eon that tcnel even to justify her in breaking her
promise to the note-holders of the bank?
Enough has been said to show, as the result of our views,
that section 28 of the charter of the Bank of Tennessee constituted a contract with the holders of the notes of the bank,
and that it was not inthe constitutional power of the legislature to repeal the section so as to affect the notes which, at
the time, were in circulation.

from the Circuit Court for the Western District
of Tennessee, the case being thus:
In 1849 the State of Tennessee incorporated a company
called the Memphis Gaslight Company. The charter provided as follows:
APPEAL

See. 3. It shall be the duty of said company to establish,
within three years from the 1st of January, 1850, a gas manufactory within the city of Mempbis, of sufficient capacity, to supply its corporate authorities and inhabitants with such public
and private gaslights as may be required.
See. 4. To enable said company to establish said works, they
are hereby authorized and empowered to lay down pipes and
extend conductors and other apparatus through all or any of the
streets, lanes, or alleys of the said city.
Sec. 5. The said company shall have the privilege of erecting, establishing, and constructing gasworks, and manufacturing
and vending gas in the said city, by means of public works, for
the term of fifty years. A reasonable price per thousand feet for
gas shall be charged in the case of private individuals, to be regulated by the prices in the other Southwestern cities; and for public
light such sums as may be agreed upon by the company and the
public authorities of MIemphis.

Another section provided, that if, at the end of twenty

years, the city resolved to buy the gasworks, it might do so;
and a mode of fixing a fair price was prescribed for taking
into consideration the value of the said gasworks, and the
lands, buildings, utensils, rights, and interests, and everything
thereunto appertaining.
The company being duly organized and set in operation,
entered, in 1852, into a contract with the city authorities, by
which these conferred upon it the exclusire privilege fortwenty
years, and until thereafter notified to the contrary, of lighting the city with such public lamps as might be agreed upon
between the parties, mnd also the right to lay down its pipes
and extend its conductors and other apparatus through all or
any of the streets, alleys, lanes, or squares, and to exercise all
the rights granted by its charter, without any other charge
or tax by the city than upon the estimated value of their
house and lot and one hundred dollars per annum.
The contract proceeded: " Still further to encourage the
company, the city agree to take/fifty lamps to beqin with, to be
extended hereafter as the public wants and inerease of the city may
demand, and such as may be agreed on by the company and
the city; and the company, on its part, agree, in consideration of the said several grants, concessions, and privileges,
to furnish the city, for the use of its public lamps, gas, at
one-half the price they charged their private consumers."
In 1866, the State passed an act incorporating another
gaslight company, to wit: " The Memphis Gayoso Gaslight
Company," which established an office in Memphis, and went
to work to lay down its gaspipes and extend its conductors
and other apparatus through the streets of the city. The
old company hereupon filed a bill in one of the State courts of
chancery against the new company, setting forth the above
facts, asserting that the privilege of furnishing gas to the
city conferred by the act of 1849, incorporating the old company, was, by its very nature and purpose, an exclusive one,
and that under the contract of 1852, it had been the intent
of the city not only to vest iii the old company the exclusive
privilege of furnishing the public lights to the city, but, in
fact, also to license it exclusively for a term of twcntv vears.

to make and sell gas for lights to the inhabitants by means
of public works, and praying accordingly an injunction to
the new company against laying pipes or establishing new
works. On this bill, in the State court, a preliminary injunction was granted by the chancellor, so far as to restrain the
new company from laying gaspipes so near to the pipes of
the old company as to cause any injury to them, but denied
so far as the bill sought to restrain the new company from
proceeding with its works; the chancellor not seeing, as he
said, that any exclusive privilege had been conferred on the
old company.
Immediately after the decree, the city authorities of Memphis passed an ordinance authorizing the mayor to hold an
election to test the sense of the voters of the city as to subscribing $250,000 to the stock of the new company; whereupon, on the following day, and before any election was held,
Dean, a citizen of New York (the present appellee, and a
large stockholder in the'old company), filed a bill in this case
in the court below, against the new company, and also
against the city of Memphis, setting forth the act of incorporation of the old company, the company's organization
and successful operation, with a statement of the outlays aid
trouble which organizing and putting it in such operation
bad cost; setting forth the contract of 1852; the act of incorporation of the new company,: that this new company
was laying down pipes and disturbing the ground where the
pipes of the old one lay, and was injuring them; that it was
asserting the right to manufacture gas by public works and
sell the same to the inhabitants of Memphis in competition
with the said company, and that this last had the exclusive
privilege of supplying the corporate authorities and inhabitants with such public and private gaslights as might be
required, which grant the General Assembly could not constitutionally revoke.
The bill set fbrth also the act of the city government authorizing an election, tl e bill in connection with that point,
proceeding as follows:
"And the complainant apprehends that the influence of the

corporate authorities will be exercised upon the voters of the
city, very few of whom comparatively are purchasers of gas,
favorably to the said project, and that the said authorities will
proceed to subscribe to the stock of the new company, and issue
the bonds as contemplated in the said ordinance, and thus the
defendants will consummate a great wrong to the complainant,
to the great injury of the franchise of the old one."
Finally, the bill complained that the old company, of
which the complainant alleged himself to be, perhaps, the
largest stockholder, declined, at his request, to proceed in
the courts against the rival company, and against the corporate authorities of Memphis, alleging that they had already
filed a bill in the Chancery Court of the State, against the
company, and obtained a partial injunction, but that they
refused to proceed further.
The prayer was fbr an injunction restraining the city
authorities from holding the election intended, or f'om subscribing to the stock, or issuing bonds, &c., and enjoining
the new or Gayoso Company from laying pipes in the streets
of Memphis, and from manufacturing gas and selling the
same to the inhabitants.
To this bill the new or Gayoso company pleaded:
1. That it was not true, as alleged, that the Memphis or
old company had refused to take the necessary legal steps
to assert, and maintain the rights of complainant, but that,
on the contrary, they had filed a bill in the State Chancery
Court, wherein the same relief was sought as in the present
bill, &c., &c.
2. That the said cause instituted in the said Chancery
Court was then still pending; that the same identical matters
were presented fbr adjudication as in the present bill ; that
the said court had full and ample jurisdiction; that a partial
injunction had been obtained, and that the Gayoso or new
company was still bound by the said partial injunction, and
was still subject to the further order of the said Chancery Court in
the premises, &c., &c. The record of the prior suit was tendered with the pleas, and substantiated the facts set forth in

Argument for the new company.

them. The new company and the city of Memphis also put
in answers. These admitted the facts stated by the bill as
to the incorporation of the respective companies and their
organization under the laws. They admitted also the contract between the old company and the city authorities, but
they denied that the said contract gave any exclusive privilege except as to the public lamps. They also denied the
power of the city to grant any such exclusive right, even if
it had purposed to do so.
The cause was set down for hearing by consent of parties
on the bill and exhibits, and on the answer of the new company and exhibits, and the answer of the city. And the
court, after hearing, determined that the complainant was
entitled to the relief prayed for, and decreed perpetual
injunctions against the new company and the city, thus
annihilating the new company. The cause was now before
this court on appeal.
The questions considered by the court were:
1. Admitting that Dean, a mere individual stockholder
in the older Memphis Gaslight Company, would have had a
right to represent by himself, as he here assumed to do, the
interest of the entire corporation, if the corporation had not
itself brought suit in the State court, how far that suit, yet
pending, precluded the institution of the present action; the
suit in the State court being against the new corporation
alone, and the present one being against both it and the
city of Memphis?
2. It being decided that the suit in the State court against
the new company did preclude the institution of the present
one though against it and the city, whether-technical objec
tions being disregarded-the contract of 1852 estopped the
city from subscribing to stock in the new company.
lr. F. P. Stanton, for the appellants:
1. Admitting that Dean, to establish an exclusive right in
the old company, might have instituted suit against the new
one, if the old company had refused to do so, yet here the
pleas disclosed that there was no such refusal, but on the

MEIIIS CITY V. DEAN.

contrary, the commencement of a suit. The injunction
granted there was in full operation when Dean filed his bill
in the court below; and it is evident that lie went into the
Federal court, in order to evade the jurisdiction of the local
one; to appeal, in fact, from the decision of the State chancellor, who had refused to recognize the monopoly claimed
by the old company. He made the mayor and aldermen
parties to the proceeding, probably because he supposed that
would enable him to avoid the plea of a prior action pending.
But the fact of additional parties being included in the
second suit does not alter the application of the principle.
The test is the identity of the matters in issue, the rights
claimed, and the relief sought. In both cases, the foundation of the proceeding is the same. Both rely upon the monopoly claimed by the elder gas company, the exclusive right
said to be granted in their charter, to make and sell gas in
Memphis. The proceeding against the city authorities depends wholly on this claim; for unless the exclusive right
claimed can be established, there is no pretence of any right
in a citizen of New York to interfere with the proposed acts
of the mayor and aldermen. If that exclusive right can be
established, then the injunction against the city would be
useless, inasmuch as an injunction against the new company
would suspend their work, in spite of the people or public
authorities of Memphis.
2. The matter of exclusive right under the charter had
been therefore passed on primarily, or was pending in the
State court, a competent tribunal. This court would not
interfere. Nothing therefore remained for the complainant
but the contract of 1852, and it was plain from the terms of
that contract, that under it all exclusive right was confined
to supplying the public lamps, and this for but a limited
term. Until the city should violate the contract, which it
was not alleged that it had yet done, no right of action could
lie against it.
Messrs. McRea and iiunes, con ra:
1. The plea denying the allegation of the bill that +he old or

Dec. 1868.]

MEMPHIS CITY V. DEAN.
Argument for the old company.

Memphis Gaslight Company had refused to take the necessary legal steps to assert and maintain the rights of the complainant, and the assertion in the plea that there was a former suit depending for the same cause of action, are answered
by the fact that the suit begun in the State court by the old
company, was brought against the new or Memphis Gayoso
Gas Company alone. That bill only set up the claim of the
old company to the exclusive privilege, and only asked an
injunction to stop the progress on the streets of the rival
company. The action of the other defendant-the city authorities-was taken after the disposition of the other cause
in the State court, and was a new grievance. The present
bill alleged that without reference to any exclusive privilege
in the old company under its charter, the action of the city
authorities is a fraud upon the contract made by them with
the complainant's company; that the action of the board gives
strength and credit to the other defendant, Which enables
it to prosecute its wrongs. This is enough to take the case
from the objection of a prior suit pending, or resjudicata;and
to leave us the benefit of the principle quia tirnet; as a preventive remedy, one most beneficial to both parties, and to
be therefore encouraged.
2. The contract of 1852 is exclusive not only of the right
to supply public lamps for a certain term, but also of the
right to encourage a rival to come into the city within the
term, for after beginning with fifty lamps, it promises in
order "still further to encourage the company," that as the city
extends itself, it will increase the number of lamps for which
gas shall be furnished. It gives the old company, moreover,
"the right to lay down its pipes and extend its conductors
and other apparatus through all of the streets, alleys, lanes,
or squares of the city." This is necessarily exclusive. Gaspipes must be laid down so as to occupy an inclined plane,
and cannot be laid otherwise. This necessity arises from
two causes: first, the gas being lighter than common air, its
tendency is to rise, and hence the difficulty and great pressure required to force it through pipes descending from the
reservoir. Secondly, the gas, in its passage from the works

MEMiPHIS CITY v. DEAN.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument as to the exclusive right.

or reservoir, carries with it vapor of water; this vapor, in its
passage through the pipes underground, is condensed, and
if no provision were made, the water would eventually obstruct the pipes and stop the passage of the gas. Therefore
drip-boxes are placed at intervals to collect the liquor caused
by condensation. The pipes must all incline into these dripboxes to enable the water to drain into them. Thus the
network of pipes is placed in a plane inclining to the dripboxes and the reservoirs. Hence the absolute necessity that
the company should have the exclusive use and occupation
of the streets.
Moreover, the subtle character of gas renders it difficult
to convey it through pipes without serious loss from leakage,
and requires that the pipes should be laid on solid earth and
remain perfectly undisturbed. The easement of the old
company in the streets of the city would obviously be inpaired by yielding to another company the same easement,
and the charter of the latter must impair and destroy the
obligation of the contract, made in 1852, with the former.
[In addition to the points thus raised, the counsel on both
sides argued largely-asking the opinion of this court upon
it-the question of the exclusive right of the old or Memphis
Company under its charter; Mr. Stanton relying on the constitution of Tennessee, which he stated in section 22 of its
declaration of rights declared "that perpetuities and monopolies were contrary to the genius of a free State, and should
not be allowed," and on the Bridqe Proprietors v. Hoboke"

quiring to be encouraged and "still further encouraged," the
facts that the charter was, by its words, but a limited term;
that the duty of supplying the city and its inhabitants was
made a condition of the privileges granted, imposed, and
assumed, and so implied a correlative obligation to take;
that the price of the gas was to be reasonable and regulated
by the price in other and larger cities, where it might cost
much less to manufacture; that the works were called "public works;" that the legislature had reserved a right to compel the old corporation to sell out on paying fair value for
its property and rights, a reservation which would have been
useless if they could set up another company, and a reservation which, to suppose was inserted with such a purpose
secretly entertained, to set up such other company, would
be discreditable to the city against which such supposition
was raised.]
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
The judgment of the court in the case of -Dodgev. Woolsey,* authorizes the stockholder of a company to institute a
suit in equity in his own name against a wrong-doer, whose
acts operate to the prejudice of the interests of the stockholders, such as diminishing their dividends and lessening
the value of their stock, in a case where application has first
been made to the directors of the company to institute the
suit in its own name, and they have refused. This refusal
of the board of directors is essential in order to give to the
stockholder any standing in court, as the charter confers
upon the directors representing the body of stockholders, the
general management of the business of the company. There
must be a clear default, therefore, on their part, involving a
breach of duty, within the rule established in equity, to authorize a stockholder to institute the suit in his own behalf,
or for himself and other stockholders who may choose to
join. The plea in abatement in the record is founded upon
this view of the law. It not only denies the refusal, but
* 18 Howard, 331-345. 'See also Bronson v. La Crosse Railroad Co., 2
Wallace, 283.

MEMPHIS CITY v. DEAN.

[Sup. Ct

Opinion of the court.

avers the institution of a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction, and in which the ground of complaint is substantially the same as set forth in the complainant's bill. This
is a plea to the person of the complainant. Pleas to the
person, says Mr. Daniel,* like pleas to the jurisdiction, do
not necessarily dispute the validity of the rights, which are
made the subject of the suit, but object to the plaintiff's
ability to sue, or the defendant's liability to be sued respecting them. And Judge StolTt observes, "They object to the
plaintiff that he is by law disabled to sue in a court of justice, or that he cannot institute a suit alone, or that he is not
the person he pretends to be, or that he does not sustain the
chai'acter he assumes." These are properly pleas in abatement, or at least in the nature of abatement.1
It is insisted, however, on the part of the learned counsel
for the appellee, that the suit in the State court did not
cover all the grievances set forth in his bill, as the directors
were required to proceed against the city of Memphis, which
was not a party defendant in that suit, but is in the present
one. The charge in his bill is, that the city authorities
passed an ordinance authorizing the mayor to hold'an election to test the sense of the voters of the city as to the
propriety of subscribing $250,000 to the stock of the Memphis Gayoso Company, and he apprehends that the influence
of the corporate authorities will be exercised on the voters
favorable to the company, and will proceed to subscribe to
its stock; and further, that the city had entered into a contract with complainant's company to furnish the lamps of
the city with gas for twenty years, and that this action of
the city is in violation of that contract; and the bill prays
that the city may be enjoined from holding the election or
subscribing to the stock. This is the branch of the case
relied on to show that the suit in the State court was not a
compliance with, or a fulfilnent of; the request of the complainant to the directors of the Memphis Gaslight Company
to institute legal proceedings.

CITY V. DEAN.

Opinion of the court.

But, admitting all this to be true, it furnishes no valid
ground for making the Memphis Gayoso Gas Company a
party, and agitating over again the same question which
was pending in the State court, namely, whether or not the
Memphis Gaslight Company had an exclusive right to
furnish the city of Memphis with gas. There is no necessary connection between that suit, or the subject-matter
involved in it, and the one against the city. The former
turns upon a construction of the charter of the Memphis
Gaslight Company. The latter, upon a written contract
between this company and the city. The question here has
no connection with that of the exclusive privileges of the
company under the charter. If any puit was desired, or
advisable, agaiust the city, it should have been a separate
one, founded on the contract.
Besides, the suit against the city was premature. Until
the question was decided whether or not the Memphis
Gayoso Gas Company was valid, and had a right to establish
itself in the city of Memphis, the suit against the city was
founded on a hypothetical case. If held by the State court,
on the 'final hearing, that the Memphis Gas Company had
the exclusive right, the existence of-the othe; company
must cease, and the suit against the city would be superfluous.
The suit is premature, also, for the reason it is founded
on a contingency, that a majority of the voters of the city
will vote in favor of a city subscription to the stock. The
bill seeks to' enjoin the city from holding the election, for
fear a majority may favor subscription; and then, that the
city will subscribe. The complainant should have waited
till after the result of the election, and, if it had been against
making any subscription, no suit would have been required;
if in favor, it would have been time enough to have filed the
bill.
But, over and beyond all these objections, we are satisfied
that there is nothing in the provisions of the contract that
can be made available to estop the city from subscribing to
the stock. It secures to the complainant's company the ex-

MEMPHIS CITY V. DEAN.

[Sup. (3t.

clusive privilege of supplying the public lamps in the streets
of the city with gas for twenty years, at one-half the price
which is charged to private persons. This is the essence of
the contract. There are other details to enable the coropany
to fulfil its portion of the stipulations, such as the privilege
of laying down their pipes in the streets, and of exercising
all the rights under the charter within the limits of the city,
without any other tax or charge than upon the estimated
value of their house and lot, and one hundred dollars per
annum. The city agrees to take fifty public lamps to begin
with, to be extended thereafter according to the public
wants. All the obligations, whatever they may be, to be
found in the contract on the part of the city are binding
upon it, and if broken, the courts will afford the proper
remedy. The establishment of another company therein will
not change its nature or obligation, much less abrogate it.
To this extent the city is bound, but no further. There is
neither an express or implied obligation not to take stock
in any other company.
The idea that the subscription to the stock of the new
company would aid or encourage its establishment in the
city, and hence would operate as a violation of the contract,
finds no support in that instrument.
The result of our opinion is, that the only question that
it was competent for the complainant, as a stockholder of
the Memphis Gaslight Company, to compel the directors
to present to a court of justice, was that involving its exclusive right, under the charter, to furnish the city of Memphis with gas; and as that had been presented to a court of
competent jurisdiction, in a suit then pending, he is disabled,
according to the settled rule on this subject, from instituting
a suit in his own name in another court.

with directions to dismiss the bill.
