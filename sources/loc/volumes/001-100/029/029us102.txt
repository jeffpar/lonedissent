Ex PAifTE

MAnTzA BitADSTIr.ET; iN THE MATTnR Op JAn.s JAcxsoN Ex DEx. MAXiTHA BnADSTREET VS. DANIEL TomAs.

A rule had been granted onthe district judge of the northern district of New York,
to show cause why he did not sign a bill of exceptions in a case tried before
him. The court said, that on the day 6T the return, of the rule, the district
judge has a right to show cause; whether the person who obtained the rule
moves or not. He has a right to have the rule disposed of.
On the trial of a cause in the district court of the United States, for the northern
district of New York, exceptions were taken to opinions of the court'delivered in the course of the trial; and some time after the trial was over, a bill of
exceptions was tendered to the district judge, which he refused to sign, objecting to some of the matters stated in the same, and at the same time altering
the bill then tendered, so as to conform to his recollection of the facts of the
case, and inserting in the bill all that he deemed proper to be contained in the
same; which bill of exceptions, thus altered, was signed by the judge. On
the motion of the party who had tendered the bill of exceptions, a rule was
granted on the district judge, to show cause why he didnot sign the bill of
exceptions as first tendered to him. To this rule the judge returned his reasons for refusing to sign the bill so tendered, and stating that he had signed
such a bill of exceptions as he considered correct.
By the Court. This is not a case in which the judge has refused to sign a bill
of exceptions. The judge has signed such a bill as he thinks correct. The
object of the rule is to oblige the judge to sigm a particular bill of exceptions
which has been offered to him. The court granted the rule to show cause;
and the judge has shown cause, by saying he has done all that can be required
from him, and that the bill offered is not such a bill as he can sign. The court
cannot order him to sign such'a bill.
A return by the district judge to a rule ,o show cause, need not be sworn to by
him. [103]
The law requires that a bill of exceptions should be tendered at the trial. If a
party intends to take a bill of exceptions, hg should give notice to the judge
at the trial ; and if he does not ip it at the trial, be should move the judge to
assign a reasonable time within.which he may file it. A practice to sign it
after the term, must be understood to be matter of consent between the parties;
unless the judge has made an express order in the term, allowing such a period
to prepare it.

AT January term 1829, on m'otion of 'r Key, and on
affidavit filed, the court granted a rule on the honourable
Alfred Conklin, district judge of tle northern district of New
York, to show cause why he did not sign a certain bill of
exceptions tende-ed -to him on the patt of the plaintiff, in

the ease of James Jackson ex dem. of Mattha Bradstreet vs.
Daniel Thomas; which cause had been tried before him, and
a verdict given for the defendant. The rule was made returnable on the second Monday in January of this term.
The same rule was obtained in the case of Jackson ex dem.
of Martha Bradstreet vs. Joseph Kirkland.
To this rule the district judge, on the 10th of December
1829, returned with the bills of exceptions which had ecompanied the copy of the rule as served upon him, his reasons
for refusing to comply with the demand of the'plaintiff.
On the 27th day of February, the return day of the rule
having passed, Mr Storrs, after notice to Mrs Bradstrept,
moved to take up the return-of Judge Conklin. He said,
that many importaht titles depended upon the decision of
the cases in which the rules had been granted, and one of
these cases was upon the calendar of this court. The return
has been made, and the district judge has obeyed the mandate of this court. This application is also submitted at
the instarnce of the district judge; who is not willing to stand
before the court without a decisive inquiry into his proceedings.
Mr Key objected to the court taking up the case on the
application of any one but Mrs Bradstreet. It was for-her
to call it up during the term, and to determine at what timhe.
It will depend on the result of the case on the calendar,
what course she will pursue.
Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL. The district judge of the
northern district of New York has been called upon by a rule
of this court to show cause ; and on the dhy of the return
of the rule he has a right to show cause ; whether the person
who obtained the rule moves or not. There is no question
but that Judge Conklin has a right to have the rule disposed of.
The case went off until the following motion day, by agreement.
Afterwards, Mr Storrs said, the return to the rule having
been made by judge-Conklin in his official capadity ; he had
not sworn to it; but if this shall be required by the court,
it will be done.

SUPREME COURT.
EEx parts Martha Bradstreet.]

Mr Chief Justice-M RHAL . The judge need not swear
to the return of the reasons why he refused to sign the bill
of exceptions.
The return set forth, that at the time of the trial of the

cause mentioned in the rule; no bill of exceptions was tendered, nor were any exceptions reduced to writing, except
by himself in the minutes which he kept of the trial; unless,
which was probable, the counsel also noted them in their
minutes. Several weeks after the trial, the amended bill of
exceptions, accompanied by a paper containing numerous
amendments proposed by the counsel forthe defendant, was
delivered to him for correction ; and he thereupon proceeded,
with due deliberation, and with the. aid of his notes of the
trial, to correct and settle the same, in conformity, as nearly
as possible, with the truth of the case,. No counsel appeared for either party, and no application was made for some
time for the bill of exceptions by the counsel in the cause.
In an amended return, the district judge- stated that some
correspondence had taken place with Mrs Bradstreet, in
relation to alterations proposed to be made in the bill of
exceptions; and in. an interview with her, nothing was said
by her which was understood as an intimation of her intention or wish to be heard further upon the subject.
The return then proceeds to state, that in the bill of exceptions, as proposed by Mrs Bradstreet, many alterations had
been made in terms and language, of little importance, and
matters pre introduced as having occurred on the trial, which
did not occur, circumstances are misstated, and opinions
are imputed to him wvhich he did not 6xpress ; and thus many
parts of the amendments proposed by the plaintiff were
untrue ; and that therefore the same were not signed by him.
The particulars to which these representations refer are
stated in the return.
The return, after stating that in reference to an instrument
of writing-produced in the cause, in the bill of exceptions as
signed by the judge, a brief description of the instrument was
inserted, instead of the whole, in extenso, which had been
done in conformity with the established rules of practice, requiring only so much of the evidence offered upon the trial

JANUARY TERM 1830.
[Ex parte Martha Bradstreet.]

as is sufficient fully and -fairly to present every question of
law embraced in the exception, proceeds".In conclusion, I have only to add the expression of my
conviction, that although this rule of law has by no means
been rigidly applied in abridging this bill, it has in no instance keen departedfrom to the prejudice of the plaintiff."'
"If, however, on a -particular examination of the bill and
amendments, (without which, I may be permitted to remark,
it is impossible to form a just conclusion,) your honourable
court should, in regard to thi documentary evidence, entertain a different opinion, I shall most cheerfully obey its mandate to correct the supposed error."
Mr Storrs, on a motion to discharge the rule; stated that
this court would never require a judge to sign a bill of exceptions which he considers incorrect. The court will adopt
another course, and will leave it to the judge to re-examine
the bill, and to do what he shall consider proper.
The bill of exceptions was not made out and offered to
the judge at the trial, which is the practice in New York,
nor was it presented to him until a long time afterwards;
and it was then corrected according to his notes.
The true course would be to refer the matter back to ihe
judge; and let him appoint a time, on notice to both parties,
to appear before him, and revise the bill of exceptions.
This the judge is perfectly willing to do.
Mr Storrs stated, that he. was'the counsel for the parties
in interest in the case, and he was desirous to see that their
interests should not suffer-. He also wished to present the
case on the part of Judge Conklin, and ask the attention of
the court to it.
Mr Key, in opposition to the motion, contended,
1. That this court would consider the bills of exceptions
as duly tendered, inasmuch as the judge, though he states
that they were not tendered during the term, does not allege that they were out of time ; and if, by the general
practice of the court, or by consent, they were writteh during the trial and presented afterwards, which is not denied,
they ought to be considered in time. 6 Johns. Rep. 279.
2 Tidd- 788. That this had been agreed to, he inferred
VoL. IV.-o

SUPREME COURT.
[Ex parte Martha Bradstreet.]

from the return made by the district judge, and from the
affirmance of facts in the affidavit, not denied in the return.
2. This court will now look at the bills of exceptions and
the returns; and whatever parts of the bills have been objected to, and the objections justified by the return, they will
order to be certified; and- such facts as have been objected
to, and the objections not sustained by the return, the judge
will also be called on to certify. 2 Lord Ray. 1008. Unless
this is -done, the remedy by mandamus is nugatory.
It was unimportant as to the manndr in which the omissions should be required to be certified. This might be done
in any mode most respectful to the judge.
The intimation of the counsel for the district judge, that
the bills of exceptions may be settled by d hearing before
the judge, on notice,.-would probablyremove all the difficulties in the case, if the rule should now be discharged.
Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court.
*The court is unanimously of opinion that the rule ought
not to be granted.
This is not -a case in which the judge has refused to sign
a bill of exceptions. The judge has signed such a bill as he
thinks correct. If the court.had granted a rule upon the
district judge to sign a bill of exceptions, the judge could
have retirned that he had performed that duty. But the
object of the rule is, to oblige the judge to sign a particular
bill of exceptions, which had been offered to him. The court
granted the rule to show cause; and the judge has shown
cause, by saying he has done all that can be required from
him; and that the bill offered to him is not such a bill as he
can sign.
Nothing can be more manifest, than that the court cannot
order himto sign such a bill of exceptions. The person who
offerq a bill of exceptions ought to present such a one as the
judge can sign. The course to be pursued is, either to endeavour to draw up a bill, by agreement, which the judge can

JANUARY TERMf 1830.
[Ex parte Martha Bradstreet.]

sign ; or to prepare a bill to which there will be no objection,
and present it to the judge.
The court will observe, that there is something in this proceeding which they cannot, and which they ought not to
sanction. A bill of exceptions is handed to the judge several weeks after the trial of the cause, and he is asked to
correct it from memory. The law requires that a bill of
exceptions should be tendered at the trial. But the usual
practice is to request the judge to note down in writing the
exceptions, and afterwards, during the session of the court,
to hand him the bill of exceptions, and submit it to his correction from his notes. If he is to resort to his memory, it
should be handed to.him immediately, or in a reasonable
time after the trial. It would be dangerous to allow a bill
of exceptions of matters dependent on memory, at a distant
period, when he may not accurately recollect therp. ArD
the judge ought not to allow it.
If the party intends to take a bill of exceptions, he should
give notice to the judge at the trial; and if he does not file
it at the trial, he should move the judge-to assign -a reasonable time within which he may file it.. A practice to sign it
after the term must be understood to be a 'Matterof consent between the parties, unless the judge has made an express order in the term, allowing such'a period to prepare it.
It is ordered by the court that the mandamus as prayed
for be, and the same is -hereby refused; and that the rule
heretofore granted in this cause be. and the same is hereby

discharged.
