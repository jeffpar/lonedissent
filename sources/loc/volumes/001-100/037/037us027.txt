WOOLSEY, THE BANK OF UTICA ET AL.

The district qttorney of the United States filed an information in his own name, in
behalf of the United States, in the district'court, for the -northern district of New
York, to enforce a mortgage given to the United States, by Woolsey, one ofthe
defendants. This form of proceeding has been for a long time used, without objection, in the courts of the United States, in New York; and was doubtless borrowed from the form used in analogous cases, in the courts of the state of New
York, where the state itself was the plaintiff in the suit . The United States
may be considered as the real party, although, in form, it is the information and
complaint of the district attorney.
It is crtainly desirable that the practice should be uniform in the courts of the United States; and that, in all suits where the United States are the real plaintiffs,
the proceeding should be in their name; unless it is otherwise ordered by act of
congress.

APPEAL from the district court of the United States for the northern district of New York.
The district attorney of the United States 'for the northern district, filed in the district court of the northern district, an information
on behalf of the United States, for the purpose of foreclosing a mort-.
gage executed by Melancthon T. Woolsey to the United States, in
July, 1825, as a security for the payment of a debt due by him to
the United States, in one year after its date. The mortgage comprehended land in the county of Jefferson, and in the county of St.
Lawrence, New York; and it was recorded in Jefferson county, on
the 26th day of November, 1830, and in the county of St. Lawrence, on the 10th of June, 1831.
The Bank of Utica had obtained a judgment against Melancthon
T. Woolsey, in the supreme court of, New York, on the 17th of October, 1816, for one thousand six hundred dollars, which judgment
waj docketed on the 24th of November, 1817. No execution was
issued on this judgment until it was revived by a scire facias, on the
9th July, 1828. A fieri facias was then issued on the judgment,
and the lands mortgaged to the United States were sold to satisfy
tha debt, and were purchased by the Bank of Utica; to whom they
were conveyed by the sheriff on the 3d May, 1830. The lands Jn

[Benton v. Woolsey et al.]

St. Lawrence county were sold by the sheriff, January 30, 1829,
and conveyed to the Bank of Utica, on the 15th May, 1830, having
been purchased by the bank.
By the law of New York, the judgments in favour of the Bank of
Utica, ceased to be a lien on the lands of Woolsey, aTter tenyear',
against bona fide purchasers and subsequent incumbrances; and the
district attorney, on behalf of the United States, claimed the oZperation of the mortgage to the United States, so as to exclude the claim
of the bank, under the judgment upon which the land was sold, and
purchased by the bank to satisfy their debt. No money was paid
by the bank, at the time of the purchase, except the expenses attending the proceedings against the land; but the bank claimed to hold
the ]and as a bona fide purchaser, the property having been bought
to satisfy the debt due on the judgment, and without notice of the
mortgage to the United States; it not having been put on rec rd until after the proceedings under the judgment.
The district court gave a decree in favour of the defendants, and
the plaintiff appealed to this Court.
The questions arising on this case were argued at large, in printed
arguments, by Mr. Butler, the attorney general, for the United
States; and by Mr. Beardsley, for the detendants.
The judgment of the district court was affirmed, by a divided
Court; and no opinion was given on any of. the questions raised and
argued in the cause; except upon a question of jurisdiction. Mr.
Justice Thompson did not sit in the cause, being connected with one
of the parties to it.
The Court intimated a doubt of their jurisdiction in the case, as
the district attorney had instituted the suit in his own name.
Upon this question Mr. Butler, the attorney general, said:
That the bill represents a case, in which the United States are exclusively the parties complainants; and the appeal is taken by the
district attorney, as prosecuting for the United States. The United
States are the only parties, and the district attorney has no interest
in the cause. The Court will not look, particularly, at forms, when
the substance of the case is manifestly within its jurisdiction.
The judiciary act gives jurisdiction to the courts of the United
'States, in all cases in which the United States are parties. It is then

[Benton v. Woolsey et al.]

submitted, that as the interest in the suit is entirely in the United
States, the Court will consider the case as if brought in the name of
the United States.
The rules of practice in the courts of chancery; in England, are
the rules established for the government of suits in chancery in the
courts of the United States. Where those rules are silent, the practice of the state courts is resorted to. In the courts of New York,
it is the practice to file bills in the name of the attorney general, in
cases in which the state of New York is interested, in one instance, in the circuit court of the, southern district of New York, this
practice was adopted. Cited, 33 Rule of the Practice of the Circuit
Courts in proceedings in Chancery. Newland's Practice, 55.
It is admitted that no officer of the United States can be sued as

such; nor can he, <without the authority of an-act of congress, institute a suit. But this does not apply in admiralty cases, or in cases
in equity; where the United States, being interested, the law officer
of the United States often interposes.
In the case of Brown v. Strode, 5 Cranch, 303; 2 Cond. Rep.
265; it was held, that the courts of the United States have jurisdiction in a case, in which citizens of-the United States are but nominal
plaintiffs, for the use of an alien. On the authority of this 'case, and
of the practice of the courts of the state of New York, the jurisdiction of the Court is claimed. The district attorney is but a nominal
party.
Mr. Beardsley, for the defendants, said no wish was entertained
to prevent the Court taking jurisdiction of the case.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case, a bill of information and complaint was filed by the
district attorney of the United States, in behalf of the United States,
in the district court for the northern district qf New York, against
Melanethon C. Woolsey, the Bank of Utica and others, for the purpose of foreclosing a mortgage upon certain real property, executed
by the said Woolsey to the United States, on the 20th of July, 1825,
to secure the payment of twenty-nine thousand four hundred and
fifty-nine dollars and twenty-nine cents, in one year from the date,
with interest. The property mortgaged, was .situated partly in the
county of Jefferson, and partly in the county of St. Lawrence, in
the state of New York; and the mortgage was recorded in the coun-

[Benton v. Woolsey et al.]

ty of Jefferson, November 26th, 1830; and in the county of St. Lawrence, June 10th, 1831.
It appears, from the answer and evidence, that the Bank of Utica
obtained a judgment in the supreme court of the state of New
York, against the said Woolsey, on the 7th October, 1817, for sixteen
thousand dollars; and the judgment was docketed November 24th,
1817. No further proceedings were had upon it until May term,
182s, when it was revived by scire facias, and the judgment on the
scire facias docketed July 9th, 1828.
-Process Of fieri facias issued on this judgment, endorsed to ievy
six thousand six hundred and 4ixty-seven dollars and fifty cents;
and the lands mortgaged to the United States, in Jefferson county,
were sold by the sheriff, on the 24th of November, 1828; and (with
the exception of a small parcel,) purchased by the bank. They
were conveyed by the sheriff to the bank, May 3d, 1830. The
lands in St. Lawrence county, mortgaged to the United States, were
sold by the sheriff, January 30th, 1829; and conveyed by the sheriff
to the hank, May 15th, 1830.
The judgment obtained by the bank, in 1817, after the expiration
of ten years -from the time it was docketed, ceased, by the law, of
New York, to be a lien upon real estate, against bona fide purchasers,
or subsequent incumbrances, by mortgage, judgment, or otherwise;
and, consequently, after the 24th of November, 1827, it no longer
bound the property of Woolsey.
The bank denies, in its answer, that it had notice of the mortgage
in question, at the time it purchased and obtained the conveyances;
and there is no evidence, in the record t6 charge them with notice.
It purchased and obtained the deeds, as above stated, before the
mortgage was recorded. No money was paid by the bank, on the
purchase, except for expenses of sale and costs. The property was
bought to secure the debt due from Woolsey; and the bank claims,
by reason of that debt, to be a bona fide purchaser, for a valuable
consideration; and, having had no notice of the mortgage to the
Uni.cd States, it insists that it is entitled to hold the lands discharged
of the mortgage.
Some doubts were at first entertained by the Court, whether this
proceeding could be sustained in the form adopted by the district
attorney. It is a bill of information and complaint, in the name of
the district attorney, in behalf of the United States. But, upon
carefully examining the bill, it appears to be, in substance, a proceed-

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Benton v. Woolsey et al.]

ing by the United States; although, in form, it is in the name of the
officer. And we find that this form of proceeding, in such cases, has
been for a long time used, without objection, in the courts of the
United States, held in the state of New York; and was doubtless
borrowed from the form used in analogous cases, in the courts of the
state, where the state itself was the plaintiff in the suit. No objection has been madeto it either in the court below, or in this Court,
on the part of the defendants; and we think the United States may
be considered as the real party; although, in form, it is the information and complaint of the district attorney. But, although we have
come to the conclusion that the proceeding is valid, and ought to be
sustained by the Court, it is certainly desirable that the practice
should be uniform in the courts of the United States; and that, in all
suits where the United States are the real plaintiffs, the proceeding
should be in their name, unless it is otherwise ordered by act of
congress.
Considering the United States as the real party in the case, the
question to be decided by this Court is, whether, under the act of the
state of New York, concerning judgments and executions, passed
April 2d, 1813, the Bank of Utica was a bona fide purchaser at the
sheriff's sale herein before mentioned; the purchase being made not
upotn an advance of the purchase money, but to pay a precedent deb!
due to the bank by judgment.
This question has been fully argued and carefully considered by
this Court. But no opinion can be pronounced on the point, because
the judges are equally divided iipon it. Upon this division, the
judgment of the court below is necessarily affirmed.

This cause came on to be heard, on the transcript of the record from
the district court of the United States, for the northern district of
New York; and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof,
it is adjudged and ordered by this Court, that the judgment of the
said district court in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed.
