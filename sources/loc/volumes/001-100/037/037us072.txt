SUPREME COURT.

THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFFS V. LAWRENCE COOMBS.
Indictment in the. circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New
York, for feloniously stealing a quantity of merchandise belonging to the ship
Bristol, the ship being in distress and cast away on a shoal of the sea on the odast
,ofthe state of New York. The indictment was founded on the 9th section of the
act, entitled "An Act more effectually to provide for the punishment of certain
criiiis against the United States, and for other purposes; approved 3d March,
1825." The goods were taken above, high water mark, upon the beach, in the
county of Qudens, in the state of New.York. Hleld, that the offence committed
was within the jurisdiction of the circuit court.
If a section of an act of congress admits of two interpretations, one'of which brings
it within, aniA the other presses it beyond the constitutional authority of congress;
it is- the duty of the Supreme Court to adbpt the former construction: because a
presumption never ought to be indulged, that congress meant to exercise or usurp
any unconstitutional authority; unless that conclusion is forced on the Court, by
language altogether unambiguous.
In cases purely dependent upon the locality of the act done, the adniraltyjursdidtion is limited to the sea, and to the tide-water as far as the tide flows. Mixed cases
may arise, and often do arise, where the act and services done are of a mixed nature; as where salvage services are performed partly 'on tide-waters and partly on
shore, for the preservation of the property, in which he admiralty, jurisdiction has
been .constantly exercised to the extent of decreeing salvage.
Under the clause of the constitution giving the power to congress " to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and amozig the several states," congress possesses the
power to punish offences of the sort enumerated in the ninth section of\the act of
1825. The power to regulate commerce, includes the p~wer to regulate navigation, -as connected with the conmerce with foreign nations, and among the states.
It does not stop. a , the mere boundary line of a state; nor is it cohfined to acts
done on the waters, or in the necessary course of the navigation thereof. It extends'to such acts done-on land which interfere with, obstruct, or prevent the due
exercise of the power to regulate commerce and navigation with foreign nations,
and among the states. Any offence which thus interferes with, obstructs, or prevents such commerce and navigation, though done on land, may be punish~d by
congress, under its general authority, to make all laws necessary and proper, to
execute their delegated constitutional powers.
Upon the general principles of interpreting statutes, where the words are general,
the court are not at liberty to, insert limitations; not called for by the sensb, or the
objects, or the mischiefs of the enactment.

THIS case came before the Court on a certificate of a division of
opinion between the judges of the circuit court for the southern district of New York.
Lawrence Coombs was indicted under the 9th section of the act

JANUA'RY TERM, 1838.

'73

[United States v. Coombs.]

entitled, "an act more effectually to provide for the punishment of
certain crimes against the United States, and for other purposes, approved the 3d of March, J825," for having; on the 21st of November, 1836, feloniously stolen at Rockaway Beach, in' the southern
district of New York, one trunk of the value of five dollars, one
package of yarn of the value of .five dollars, one package of silk of
the value of five dollars, one roll of ribbons of the value of five dollars, one package of muslin of the value of five dollars, and six pairs
of hose of the value of five dollars; which said goods, wares and merchandise, belonged to the ship Bristol, the said ship then being in
distress and castaway on a shoal of the sea on the coast of the state
of New York, within the southern district of New York. On this
indictment the prisoner was arraigned,'and plead not guilty, and put
himself upon his country for trial.
It was admitted that the goods mentioned in the indictment, and
,which belonged to the said ship Bristol, were taken above high water mark, upon the beach, in the county of Queens; whereupon the
question arose, whether the offence committed was within the jurisdiction of the court; and on this point the judges were opposed in
opinion.
Which said point upon which the disagreement happened, was
stated under the direction of the judges of the court, at the request
of the counsel for the United States, and of Lawrence Coombs, parties
in the cause; and ordered to be certified unto the Supreme Court at
the next session, pursuant to the act in such case made and provided.
The case was argued by Mr. Butler, atto rney general of the United States. No counsel appeared for the defendant.
Mr. Butler stated that no jurisdiction could exist over the case,
unless it was given by the acts of congress. The first crimes act of
the United States, of 1790, and the act of 1825, showed the object of
congress to have been to prevent the perpetration of such crimes as
those charged against the defendant. The penalties imposed by ,the
first act, were found to be too heavy. The act of 1825 was passed,
and many offences were included in it which were in the first law.
These offences were those which might be committed "on the high
seas, and out of the jurisdiction of a particular state." But the 9th
section omits the limitation of ".the high seas," &c.
The ship must be cast away, or be in distress, or be wrecked in
VOL. XIl.-K

SUPREME COURT.
[United States v. Coombs.]

the admiralty jurisdiction'; and if any person steals goods belonging
toher, the punishment attaches. In this case, it was admitted that
the'ship was in the condition descr.ibed in the act; but the goods
were above high water mark when stolen.
The rest of the section shows that the object of congress was
to inelude cases above high water mark. "Showing false lights"
would, in most. cases, be on the shore and in places above the tide.
No serious doubt of the power of congress 'to punish such offences
can exist. The power given by the constitution to regulate commerce, necessarily includes the power to protect the goods which
are the subject of commerce; and it is of no consequence whether
the commerce is foreign or domestic.
The view which congress entertained of this power, is shown by
its legislation in the first crimes act; in which, aiding or advising in
piracy, is made punishable. These are acts which, in many cases,
would be done on shore. All that is necessary is, that the matter
which is the subject of the prosecution, shall be connected with, or
have grown out of commerce.
Mr. Justice STouy delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a case, certified upon a division of opinion of the judges of
the circuit court, for the southern district of New York. The ease,
as stated ih,the record, is as follows:
Lawrence Coombs was indicted under the 9th section of the act,
entitled "An act more effectually to provide for the punishment of
certain crimes against the United States, and for other purposes," approved the 3d of March, 1825; for having, on the 2,1st of November,
1836, feloniously stolen, at-Rockaway Beach, in the southern district
of New York, one trunk of the value of five dollars, one package of
yarn of the value of five dollars, one package of silk of the value of
five dollars, one roll of ribbons of the value of five dollars, one pack,
age of muslin of the value of five dollars, and six pairs of hose of
the value of five dollars, which said goods, wares and merchandise,
belonged to the ship Bristol, the said ship then being in distress, and
castaway on a shoal of the sea, on the coast of the. state of New York,
within the southern district of New York. On this indictment the
prisoner was arraigned, and plead not guilty; and put himself upon
his country for trial.
It was admitted, that the goods mentioned in the indictment, and
which belonged to the said ship Bristol, were taken above high water

mark, upon the beach, in the county of Queens; whereupon, the
question arose whether the offence committed was within the jurisdiction of the court; and on this point the judges were opposed in
opinion.
Which said point -, upon which the disagreement has happened, is
stated a6ove, under the direction of the judges of said court- at the
request of the counsel.-or the United States, and Lawrence Coombs,
parties in the cause, and ordered to be certified unto the Supreme
Court at the next sessi6n, pursuant to the act in such case made and
provided.
The ninth section of the act of 1825, ch. 276, on which the indictment in the present case is founded, is in -. he following Words:
"That if any person shall plunder; steal, or destroy any money, goods,
merchandise, or other effects from, or belonging to, any ship or vessel, or boat, or raft which shall be in distress, or which shall be
wrecked, lost, stranded, or cast away upon the sea, or upon any, reef,
shoal,'bank, or rocks of the sea, or in any place within the admiralty
or maritime jurisdiction'of the United States ; or if any person or
persons shall wilfully obstruct the bscape of any person endeavouring to save his Or her life from such ship Or Vessel, boat or raft,,or
the wreck thereof; or if any person shall hold out or show any false
light or lights, or extinguish any true light with intention to bring
any ship or vessel, boat or raftj
ing or bailing: upon the sea, into
danger or distress, or shipwreck; every persor so offending, his or
their counsellors, aiders or abettors, shall be deemed guilty of felony;
and shall, on conviction thereof, be punished by a fine,.not exceeding
fAve thousand dollars, and imprisonment arid confinement at hard
labour, not exceeding ten years, according to the aggravation of 'the
offence." 3 Story's Laws ofthe U. S. 2001. The indictment, as has
been already stated, charges the offence to have been committed on
Rockaway Beach; and as is admitted, above high water mark.
iBefore we proceed to the direct considetation of the true import
and interpretation of this section, itseems, highly important, ifnot
indispensable, to say a few words as to the constitutional authority of
congfess to pass the same. For if, upon a just interpretation of the
terms thereof, congress have exceeded their constitutional authority,
it tvill become our duty to say so; and to certify our opinion on the
points submitted to us, in favour of the defayidant. On the other hand,
if the section admits of two interpretations, each of which is within
the constitutional authority of congress, that ought to be ad~pted,

SUPREMP COURT.
[United States V. Coombs].

which best. conforms to the terms and the objects manifested in the
enactment, and the mischiefs which it was intended to remedy. And
again, if the section admits of two interpretations, one o.f which
brings it within, and the other presses it beyond the constitutional
authority of congress, it will become our duty to adopt the former
construction; because a presumption never ought to be indulged, that
congress meant to exercise or usurp any unconstitutional authority,
unless that conclusion is forced upon the Court by language altogether
unambiguous. And, accordingly, the point has been presented to us
under this aspect, in the argument o" the attorney general, on behalf
of the government.
There are two clauses of the constitution which may properly
come under review, in examining the constitutional: authority of congress over the subject matter of the section. One is, the delegation
of the judicial power, whieh is declared to extend "to all cases of
admiraltkr and maritime jurisdiction." The other is, the delegation
of the power "to regulate commerce witWr foreign nations, and among
the several states;" and, as connected with these, the power "to make
all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution. the foregoing power," &c.
In regard to the first clause, the queftion which arises is, what is
the true nature and extent of the admiralt'y jurisdiction. Does it, in
cases where it is dependent upon locality, reach beyond high water
mark? Our opinion is, that in cases purely dependent upon the locality of the act done, it is limited to the sea, and to tide waters, as
far as the tide flows; and that it does not reach 'beyond high water
mark. It is the doctrine which has been repeatedly asserted by this
Court; and we see no reason to depart from it. Mixed cases may
arise, and indeed often do arise, where the acts and services done Pre
of a mixed nature; as where salvage services are performed partly
on tide waters, and partly on the shore, for the preservation of the
property. saved;, in which the admiralty.jurisdiction has been constantly exercised to the extent of decreeing salvage. That this is ,
rightful exercise of jurisdiction by our courts of admiralty, was assumed as the basis of much of the reasoning of this Court, in the case
of the Ameican Insurance Company v. Canter, 1 Peters' -Rep. 511..
It has also been asserted and enforced by Lord Stowell, on various occasions; and especially in the case of The Augusta v. Eugenie, 1
Hagg. Adm. Rep. 16; The Jonge Nicholas, 1 Hagg. Adm. Rep.
201; The Ranger, 2 Hagg. Adm. Rep. 42; and The Happy Return,

2 Hagg. Adm. Rep: 198. See also The Henry, of Philadelphia, 1
Hagg. Adm. Rep. 264; The Vesta, 2 Hagg. Adm. Rep. 189; The
Salecia, 2 Hagg. Adm. Rep. 262. And this has been done,. not only
in conformity to the -doctrines of the maritime law; but also to what
has been held in the courts of common law. For it has been laid
down, that if the libel is founded upon one single continued act,
which was' principally upon the sea, though a part was upon land;
as if the mast of a ship be taken upon the sea, though it be afterwards brought ashore, noprohibition lies. Com. Dig. Adm.F. S.; 1
Rolle Adm. 533, C. 13; Coin. Dig. Adm. E. 12. It is true, that it has
been said that the admiralty has not jurisdiction of the wreck of the
sea. 3 Black. Com. 106, 107. But we are to understand by this, not
what, in the sense of the maritime and commercial law, is deemed
wreck or shipwrecked property; but "wreck of the sea" in the
purely technical sense of the common law; and constituting a royal
franchise, and a part of the revenue of the crown in England; and
often granted as such a royal franchise to lords of manors. How
narrow and circumscribed this sort of wreck is, according to the
modern doctrines of the courts of common law, may be perceived by
the statement of it in Mr. Justice Blackstone's Commentaries. 1
Black. Cor. 290 to 317. Who also shows, that it is this, and this
only, which is excluded from the admiralty jurisdiction. Lord Stowell manifestly acted upon the same doctrine, in the case of The Augusta v. Eugenie, 1 Hagg. Adm. Rep. 17; 3 Black. Com. 106, 107.
A passage has been sometimes relied on, in one of the earliest
judgments of Lord Stowell-the case of The Two Friends, 1 Rob.
Rep. 271; in which it is intimated, that if the goods, which are subject to salvage, have been landed before the process of the admiralty
court has been served upon them, the jurisdiction over them for the
purposes of salvage may be gone. But his lordship, so far from deciding the point then, greatly doubted it; and has, as it should seem,
since silently overruled the objection. Indeed, the supposed diffir
culty in that case was not that the instance court had not jurisdiction;
but that in cases of salvage on the instance, side of the court, no process of the court could be served on land, but only on the water.
Now, this is wholly inapplicable to the courts of the United. States,
where admiralty process, both in the instance and prize sides of the
court, can be served on land as well as on water. These explanations
have been made, for the sake of clearing the case from some apparent
obscurities and difficulties, as to the nature and extent of the adrmi-

SUPREME COURT.
[United Otates v. Coombs.]

~alty jurisdiction, iA cases where it is limited by-the locality of the
acts done. -In our judgment, the authority of congress, underjtis
clause of the constitution, does not extend to punish offences committed above and beyond high water mark.
But we are. of opinion, that, under the clause of the constitution
giving~power to congress "to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several'states," congress possessed the power to
punish offences of the sort which are enumerated in the ninth section
of the act' of 1825, now under'consideratfon. The power to regulate
commerce, includes the. power to regulate navigation, as conne'ted
with the commerce with-foreign 'iations, and among the states. It
was so held aad decideal by this Court, after the m'ost deliberate
consideration, in the case of Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 189. to
198. It does not stop at the mere boundary line of a state; nor is it
confined to acts done on the water, or in the necessary course of the
navigation thereof. It extends to such acts, done on land, which interfere with, obstruct,'or prevent, the due exercise of the power to
regulate'commerce and navigation with foreign nations, and among
the ktates. Any 'offence which thus interferes with, obstructs, or prevents such commerce and navigation, though done on land, may be
punished by congress, under its. general authority-to make all laws
necessary and proper to execute their delegated constitutional powers.
No one can, doubt, that the various offences enumerated in the ninth
section of the act, are all of a nature which tend essentially to obstruct, prevent, or destroy the due operations of commerce and navigation with foreign nations, and among the several states. Congress
have, in a great varietyof cases,.acted upon this interpretation of the
constitution, from the earliest period after thb3 constitution; as will be
abundantly seen by the punishment of certain offences on land, con"Anected with piracies and felonies on the high seas, in the act of 1790,
.ch. 36, sec. 10 and see. 11; and in the acts for regulation of commerce and navigation, and for the collection of the revenue,, passed
from time to time: in-which many of the penalties, forfeitures and
offepces provided for, are such as are, or may be done on land; and
yet which arise from the power to regulate commerce and navigation,
and to le4.y and collect duties. The ship registry act of 1792, ch.
45; the act of 1798, ch. 52, for the enrolment and licensing of
vessels in the coasting trade and fisheries; the act of 1790, ch. 102,
for the regulation and government of seamen in the merchants' seivice; and the revenue collection act, from.the act of 1789, ch. 5, to

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[United States v. Coombs.]

that of 1799, ch. 128, afford many pointed illustrations. We do not
hesitate, therefore, to say, that in our judgment, the present section
is perfectly within the constitutional. authority of congresslto enact;
although the offence provided for may have been-committed on land,
and above high water mark.
Let us now proceed to the interpretation of the section under
consideration. Does it mean, inthe clause inwhich this indictment
is -founded, to prohibit and punish the plundering, stealing, or destroying of any property belonging to any vessel in distress, or
wrecked, lost, stranded, or -cast away; only when the same property
is then on board of the vessel, or is then upon the sea, or upon any
,reef, shoal, bank, or rock of the sea, or in any:other place within the
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States? Or does
it mean equally to prohibit and purlish such plunder, stealing, or de.
stroying of such property; whether the act be ,done on shore, or in
any of the enumerated places below high water mark. In our,
opinion, the latter is the true. interpretation of this clause of the
sectioh.
In the first place, this is the natural meaning of the words of the
clause, taken in their actual import and connection. There is no
a)solute -locality assigned to the offence. It is ndt said, as it is in
every one of the preceding sections, that the offence shall be committed in a particular place; in a fort, dock-yard; navy yard, &c. &C.'
or upon the high seas, oi* in an arm of the sea, or in a river, &c.,
within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States,
and out of the jurisdiction of any particular state. The language-is,
"If any. person or person 'shall plunder, steal, or destroy any money,
goods, merchandise, or other effects, from or belonging to any ship,
or vessel, &o."
The plundering, stealing, or destroying need not,
then, be from any ship or vessel. It is sufficient if it be of property
"belonging to any ship or vessel." It is no where stated that this
property, belonging, to any ship or vessel, shall be in any of the
enumerated places when the bffence is committed; but only that it
shall be property belonging to the ship or vessel, which is in 'distress,
or wrecked, lost, stranded, oricast away. Locality, then, is 'attached,
to the ship or vessel, and not to the property plundered, stolen, or
'destroyed. And this, qualification is important, because it is manifest cngreps possess io' authority to punish offences of this sort generally, when committed on land; -but only to punish them when

80

SUPREME COURT.
[United. Slates v. Cbombs.]

connected with foreign trade and navigation, or with trade and navigation among the several states.
In the next place, the mischiefs intended to be stppressed by thle
section are precisely the same, whether the offence becommitted on
the shore, or below high water mark. , There is, and there can be,
no sound reason why congress should punish the offence when committed below high water mark, which would not apply equally to the
offence when committed above high water mark. In such case, the
wrong and injury to the owners, and to cimmerce ahd nafgation, is
the same; and the ptiblic policy of affording complete protectioi to
property, commerce, and navigation, against lawless 'and unprincipled freebooters, is also in each case thp same. There is, then, no
reason, founded in the language or policy of the clause, to insert a
restriction and locality which have not been expressed by the legislature. On the contrary, upon -general principles of interpretation,
where the words are general, the Court are not at liberty to insert
limitations not called for by the sense, or the objects, or the mischiefs
ofthe enactment.
In the next place, the succeding clauses of the same section greatly
aid and fortify this constrtiction; for in neither of them is there any
locality given to the offences therein stated; and indeed, any locality
would seem inconsistent witfi the professed objects of these clauses.
Thus, in the next clause, it is provided that, "if any person or
persons shall w ilfully obstruct the escape of any person endeavouring
to save his or her life, from such ship or vessel, &c.," he shall be
punished in the manner provided for in the section. Now, it is plain
that this obstruction may be as well by an act donb on shore, as by
an act done below high water mark. If may be by cutting a rope,
or hawser, or other thing used as a means of escape, and fastened to
the shore; or by removing a plank affixed at one end to the shore;
or by striking or wounding a person on his arrival at the shore; or
by intimidating him from landing, by threatening to fire on him on
landing, or otherwise, by attempting, on shore, to prevent him from
savi ng his life. But the remaining clause is still more direct. It
provides for the- case of holding out or showing a false light, or
extinguishing a true light, with the intention to bring any ship or
vessel, &c., sailing upon the sea, into danger, or distress, or shipwreck. Now, it is most manifest that these acts are such as ordinarily
are dond, and contemplated to be done on land. We do notsay contemplated, exclusively, to be done on land; for they may be done on

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

8i

[United States v. Coombs.]

the sea.," But to suppose that congress could intend to punish these
acts-only when done on the sc6, and not-to punish them when committed on shore, wopid be t6 suppose that they were solicitous to
punish., acts of possible, and rare occurrence only; and to leave unpunished those ivhich'would be of the most frequent and constant
occurrence, for such inhuman tpurposes; and most mischievous in
their consequences.
If, then, the other clauses of the same section defining offences of
a kindred nature, have no reference whatever to any locality, but
indifferently apply to the same offence, whether committed on land
or on the sea; and if (as is the fact) all these clauses 'are 'connected together, and must be read together, in order to arrive at the denunciation of the punishment which is equally applied to all; there
does seem to us to be very strong reason to believe that congress,.
,throughout the whole enactment, had the same intent: an intent to
punish all the enumerated offences, whether committed on land or
on tide waters; because they were equally within the same mischief,
and the prohibitions equally necessary to the protection bf the commerce and navigation of the United States.
It has been suggested, that there is not the same necessity for the
interposition of congress in the case of the offence contained in the
present indictment-, when committed on land, as when committed on
,the sea, or in other places within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States; because, when committed on land, the
offence is, or may be, cognizable by the state judicatories, under the
state laws. But this reasoning is equally applicable to the other
offences enumerated in the other clauses of the same section; and yet
it -can lardly be doubted that they were designed to be punished
when committed on land. And it may be furthei suggested, that'it
could scarcely be deemed prudent or satisfactory wholly to rely
upon state legislatures or state laws, for the protection" of rights and
interests specially confided 'by the constitdtion to the authority of
congress,
Independently, however, of these considerations, there are others,
which ought to have great weight; and, in our opinion, decisive influence in a question like the present,. In the first place, the act of
1825, ch. 276, manifestly contemplates, that in some of the offences
enumerated in it, the state courts would or might have a concurrent
jurisdiction; for the 23d section of the act expressly provides, "that
nothing in this act contained shall be construed to deprive the courts
VOL. XII.-L

SUPREME COURT,
[United States v. Coombs.]

of the individual states of jurisdiction, under the laws of the several
states, pver offentes made punishable by this act." Now, there are
no other sections in the act, to which this last section can more pertinently apply than to offences committed on land, within the ninth
section. It does, indeed, apply with equal force to the 23d section
of the. act , (which is also derived from the power to regulate commerce,) which provides for the punishment of cqnspiracies, combinations, and- coiffederacies, "on the high seas, or within the United
States"1, to cast',away, burn, or otherwise destroy any ship or vessel,
folr the fraudulent purposes stated in the section; and also affixes ,a
like punishment to the building or fitting out, aiding in the building
or fitting out, "within the United States," of any ship or vessel,
withintent that th saime shall be cast away, burnt, or destroyed for
the like purpose.
'In the next place, it is a most important consideration, that in cases
9f shipwreck there must always, be great practical difficulties in ascertaining the precise place, whether below or above high water mark,
where the property is first plundered, stolen or destroyed; as well as
by direct evidence to identify the' particular persons 'by whom the
offence was committed. These dreadful calamities usually occur upon
coasts, and in places where the officers and crew are total strangers to
all the inhabitants. The personal sufferings of the officers and crew,
often digable them from making any effotts, or giving any care or aid
in the preservation of the property. The hurry and confusion incident to such events, make them intent. upon consulting their own
safety, and often absorb, all their thoughts. The darkness of the night,
as well as the perils of the weather, often compel them to forego all
resistance t. the de4redators; and the latter often assemble in numbers
so large as to make' opposition hopeless, and identification of individuals and of packages impracticable. While some are on the waves
bringing the plunder to the shore; others are or may be on the shore
stationed to guard and secure the booty. Under such circumstances,
if'the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States were limited to
acts of deprbdatibn or destruction, committed below high water mark
the enactment would become practically almost adead letter; for in
most cases it would beimpossible to establish, by direct proof, that the
property was taken. below high w ater mark, A prosecution in the
state court would, in many cases, be equally liable to a failure, from
the utter impossibility of' establishing whether the act was not committed within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

[United States v. Coombs.]

States., The wisdom of the enactment, therefore, which, upon a prosecution in the courts of the United States, shouldcut off any defence
founded upon the mere absence of such proof where the offence was
committed, ,would seem to be as clear as 'its policy is obvious. It
could scarcely escape the attention of the legislature as indispensable
for the due adraihistration of public justice. And so far from wondering that the section, in question does ,not contain any restriction as to
locality of the offence, the surprise would have been great$ if it had
been found there. We'think ourselves justified in saying, that upon
the true interpretation of' the section, itcontains no such restxiction:
and that there is no grouad, in constitatioual authority, in :putic
policy, or in the nature or object of the section, which call upon us
to insert any.
Upon the whole our opinion is, that it be certifiVed to the oircuit
court for 'the southern district of. New York, that the pifenoe cmmitted was withir theJjurisdiction of-that court.

This eausp came, on to be heard on the transeript of the' record
from the cIrcuit court of the Uniter Stateg, for, the ' southetxi'district
of New York, and on .the question and point on Which the judges of
the said'court-were opposed in opinioh, ahd which.were certified to
this Court for its opinion, agreeably.to the act of congress, in such
case made and provided, and was argued by, Qunsel. On consideration whereof, it is the opiriion of this Court, upon the point which has
been certified to this Court, by the said circuit court, that: the said
offence so committed, was within the jurisdiction of' the said circuit
court; and it is ordered and adjudged, that this opinioft be certified to
the said circuit court accordingly.
