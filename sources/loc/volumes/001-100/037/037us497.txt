Commercial guaranty., The rule is well settled, that the guarantor of a promissory
note, whose name does not appear on'the-note, is bound without notice, where the
maker of the note was insolvent at its maturity; unless he can show Irehas sustained some prejudice by want of notice of a demand on the- maker of the note
and notice of non-payment.
If the guarantor'cguld prove he had suffered damage by the neglect, to make the demand on the maker of the. note, and to give notice, he could only be discharged to
the extent of the damage sustained.
In order to enable the party claiming under a guaranty, to recover from the guaran.
tor by a'letter of credit, he must prove that notice of its acceptance had been
given in a reasonable tune after the letter of credit had been accepted. This notice need not be proved to have been given in writing, or in any particular form;
but may be inferred by the jury from facts and circumstances which shall warrant such inference.
A recognition of the parties to a. letter of credit of their obligation to pay as
guarantors under a supposed liability, which did not arise from the facts of the
case, end of which facts they were ignorant, would not be a waiver of the notice
they were entitled to have of the acceptance of their guaranty.
A party to a note entitled -to notice, may waive the notice by a promise to see it
paid, or an acknowledgment that it must be paid; or a promise that " he will set
the matter to rights;" or by a qualified' promise, having knowledge of th laches of
the holder.
A promise to pay a debt by the guarantors, qualified with a condition which was
rejected, is not a waiver by the guarantor of-his right to noticd of the acceptance
of the guaranty.
When the party in whose favour a letter of credit is given afterwards becomes insolvent, and his insolvency is known to the guarantors; itis not necessary, in an
action on the letter of credit, to prove that a demand of payment was made on the
insolvent.

IN error to the distriot court of the United States for the district of
Mississippi.
This case was before the Court at January term, 1833, on a writ of
error prosecuted bythe plaintiffs in the court below; and was then remanded to the district court of Mississippi, with directions to issue a

stated in the case reported jn 1833.
The plaintiffs again brought up the case; and it was argued, by

Mr. Southard for the plaintiffs in error, and by Mr. Jones for the

Mr. Justice M'LEAN delivered the opinion of the Court:
This case is brought before this Court by .a writ of error to the
district court of Mississippi.
The action is founded on the following guaranty:
Port Gibson, 27th December, 1827.
Messrs. Reyn9lds, Byrne & Co.
Gentlemen,-Our friend, Mr. Chester Haring, to assist hihi in business, may require your aid from time to time, either by acceptances
or endorsement of his paper, or advances in cahh. In order tG save
y ou from harm in so doing, we do hereby bind ourselves, severally
and jointly) to be responsible to you, at any time, for a sum not exceeding eight thousand dollars, should the said Chester Haring fail to
do so.
Your obedient servants,
JAMES S. DOUGLASS,
THOM-AS G. SINGLETON,
,THOMAS GOING.
On the trial, the plaintiffs proved that they treated this paper as a
6ontinuing guaranty' and from time to time, on the faith of it, accepted drafts, endorsed bills, and -made advances of money at the request of Haring. And an account current was given in evidence
ihowing a balance due to the plaintiffs, from Chester Haring, on the
1st of July, 1828, of thirteen thousand seven hundred and two dollars
and seventy three cents; on 1st of January, 1829, of thirty-two thou+
sand nine hundred and twenty .dollars fifty-seven cents; and on the
1st of July in the same year, of twenty-five thousand one hundred
and. tine dollars and fifty-seven cents. And' eight bills of exchange,
drawn by Haring on the plaintiffs,- amounting to bight thousand dollars, and which were accepted and paid by them in the year 1828;
were also given in evidence.
On the first of May, 1829, it was-proved that Haring executed five
promissory notes, in the whole amounting to 'twenty-five thousand
dollars, which were endorsed by Daniel Greenleaf, and also by the
plaintiffs; and which were payable in the months of November, December, January, February and March, succeeding; the proceeds of

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

[Reynolds et al. v. Douglass et al.]

which notes, when' discounted, Were to be credited to Haring in the
geheral account.
On the 11th of April, 1829, Haring sold and transferred to Daniel
Greenleaf his mercantile establishment, which constituted the whole
of his property; and in August or September, following, he died.
At the time this transfer was made, Greenleaf gave a bond in the
penalty of thirty-two thousand dollars, with Thomas G. Singleton,
one of the guarantees and others security, conditioned that he would
faithfully pay the debts of Haring, as therein stated; and especially
after paying the home debts,," that he should pay the sum of eight
thousand dollars to the securities and signers of a letter of credit to
Reynolds, Byrne & Co., in favour of the concern of Cheter Haring,
for that amount; or otherwise relieve and exonerate the securities and
sign1ers to said letters of credit." And on the 24th of December following, Daniel Greenleaf assigned to James S. Douglass, another of
the guarantees, by deed of trust, on the conditions stated- therein,
"all, his debts,.claims and demands, either at law or in equity due,
or to become due." This assignment included the property, &e., he
received from Haring.
Qne of the witnesses examined, stated, that he heard' James S.
'Douglass and Thomas Going say, they considered the above assignments would indeknify them fo their liability under the guaranty.
There was a good deal of.evidence in the case, which, in considering the questions of law on th instructions, it is not material to
notice.
Ti ;s case was brought before this Court or certaih exceptions, at
the January term, 1833; at which time the following points were

adjudged.
1. That the paper in question was a .ontinui.ng guaranty, and was
not discharged on the payment of advances, acceptances and endorsements amounting to eight thousand dollars; but that it covered
future and successive advances, acceptances and endorsements
2. That to entitle the plaintiffs to recover on the guaranty, they
must show, that within, a reasonable. time they gave notice of its
acceptance.
3. That notice of the future and successive advances, acceptances
and' endorsements, after the acceptance of the guaranty, was not
necessary.
4. That in case of non-payment, the plaintiffs were required to

SUPREME COURT.
[Reynolds et al. v. Douglass et al.] '

show a demand of Haring; and, within a reasonable time, a notice to
the guarantees.
After the evidence was closed, the plaintiffs moved the court to
instruct the jury, "if they believe that Chester Haring was insolvent
previous to the maturity of any of the five promissory notes drawn
by Chester Haring, dated the Ist May, 1829; and that these notes
were endorsed upon the faith of the letter of credit, by the plaintiffs;
then such previous insolvency rendered it unnecessary for the plaintiffs to -give the defendants, as guarantors, notice of a demand upon
and refusal by Chester Haring to pay the said notes; and the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. But the court refused to charge as requested; and charged the jury, that the insolvency of Chester Haring
could be proved only-by a record of the insolvency, or by admission
of the defendants, and not by common rumor or hearsay evidence."
This instruction was incautiously drawn, and its language is open
to criticism. It would seem at the first view to place the right of
the plaintiffs to recover, on the fact of Haring's insolvency. This
would dispense with notice of the acceptance of the guaranty, and
with all evidence of advances of money by the plaintiffis, and of
acceptances and endorsements under it, except the five notes referred
to. But such could not have been the meaning of the instruction, as
understood by the counsel, concerned in the case, and by the court.
Much evidence had been given of advances of money, of acceptances
and of endorsements on the faith of the guaranty; and also evidence of facts, from which the jury might, in the exercise of their
discretion, infer a notice to the defendants that the guaranty had
been accepted. In tfie View of these facts, it cannot be supposed
that the plaintiffs would ask the couit to instruct the jury to find in
their favour; aside from all the other evidence in the case; if the insolvency of Haring should be satisfactorily established.
'The instruction was undoubtedly intendcd to cover the objection
that no demand had been, made of Haring on his failure to pay, nor
ndtice given to'the defendants. And that if the jury should find the
notes referred to had been endorsed on the faith of the letter of
credit, the previous insolvency of' Haring rendered notice of a deinand on him unnecessary; and consequently the want of this notice
constituted no objection to the plaintiffs' recovery. That the court
considered the instruction in this light, is clear from the qualification
which they annexed to it. By charging the jury that the insolvency
of Haring could be proved only by the admission of the defendants,

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

501

[Reynolds et al; v..Douglass et al.]

Or by record evidence, the court seem to consider if the fact of insolvency were legally made out, demand and notice were unneeessaryJ
Although the objection t6 the structure of the prayer is not without force, yet we are inclined to think that if the instruction had-been
given in the terms requested by the plaintiffs, under the circum-,
stances, it could not have misled the jury. They could not have
understood the instruction as laying down the basis of a recovery,
independent of all other evidence in the case.
In this part of the record, the question is fairly raised whether the
insolvency of Haring, either prior to or at the time of payment, will
excuse the plaintiffs from making a demand on him, and giving
notice to the guarantees.
At the death of Haring, the notes given by him on the 1st May,
1829, and endorsed by Greenleaf, were not due. And these promissory notes, to have had an influence in: the case, under the instruetion, must have been endorsed by-the plaintiffs on the fai'h of the
guaranty.
An objection is made, that these notes greatly exceed in amount
the guaranty; and, consequently, that they could not have been endorsed on the credit of the guarantees. The same objection is urged
against the'various balances) which' exceed the amount of the guaranty as stated in the account current.. And it is contended, that to
bind the guarantees, the advances, acceptances and endorsements,
although made at-successive perioa1s, on the faith of the guaranty.
must not exceed it in amount.
If this objection were well founded, it could not affect the right of
the plaintiffs.. They have brought their action on the guaranty, and
exhibit eight bills of exchange, amounting to eight thousand dollars,
.ich they aver were accepted and paid by them on the faith of the
guaranty.,
The question as to the liability of the guarantees, under acceptances and endorsements, for a sum exceeding eight thousand dollars,
does not, therefore, arise in this case; aud it is unnecessary to consider it. The advances which were made from time to time, and
also the acceptances and endorsements on the credit of the guaranty,
go to show how it was considered and treated by the. plaintiffs. And
it was a question for th 'jury to determine,.whether the advances,
acceptances and'endorsements, as alleged by the plaintiffs, were made
under the guaranty.

SUPREME COURT.
[Reynxolds et al.' v. Douglass et alj

If the insolvency -of Haring was a material fact in the case, how
was it to be proved?. Ooul4l it -be proved, only by record evidence,
or bry tke admissions of the defendants, as decided by the district
court? No reason is perceived for this rule, and there 'is no principle
of law, that sustains it. Th'e insolvency of Haring shiould be proved
in the same manner as any other fact in the cause. Was he without
pr6pcrty, and unable to pay the demands against him? There can
be no difficulty in showing his circumstances, by competent proof.
But does fhe insolvency of Haring, if it be established, excuse the
failure to 'make a demand on him at the maturityof his notes; and
to give notice to the, guarantees.
Ii. the case of Gibbs v. Cannon, 9 Sergt. &' Rawle, 198, it was
held, that on a guaranty of a promissory note. drawn ,and endorsed
by others, if the drawer and endorser are insolvent when the note
becomes due, this would, prima facie, be- evidence that: the guarantor
was not prejufdiced; and therefore the giving. him notice of non-pay,Mont, is, in ,such case, dispensed With, , And, in the case of Halbrow
v, Wilkins, I Barn. & Cressw. 10, the court say,if a guafantor of a
bill be informed, before it is due, of the insolvency of the acceptors,
and that the plaintiff looked. to him for payment; it'is not necessary
to prove presentment and notice of non-payment
In the case of Warrington and another v. Furbor and Warringtoi, 8 East, 244 lord Ellennorough says: the same strictness of
proof is 0ot necessary to charge the guarantees, as would have been
necessary to, support An action upon the bill itself, where, by the-law.
merchant, a demand upon and refusal by the acceptors must have
been proved in or-der to 'charge any other party upon the bill; and
this, notwithstanding the bankruptcy of the acceptors. But thi-is
not necessary to charge guarantees, who insure, as it were. the polvency of the 'principalsi and;theret'ore, if the latter become bankrupt and notojiously insolvent) it is the same:as if they Were dead;
and it is nugatory to go through the ceremony of making a demand
upon them.
Mr. Justice Lawrence, in the same case says, that, although proof
of a demand on, the' acceptors, who had become bankrupts, was not
necessary to charge the guarantees; yet that the 'latter were not prevented from showing that they ought not to have been called. upon
at al; for that the principal debtors, could have paid the bill if demaided of them. And Mr. Justice Le Blanc also says, in the: same
case, there is no need of the same proof to charge a guarantee, as to

JANUARY TERM, 1838. Q
[Reynolds et al. v. Douglass et al.]

charge a party A;hose name is upon the bill of exchange; for it is
sufficient, as against the former, to show that the holder of the bill
could not have obtained the money by making a demand upon the
bill.
In the third volume of his Commentaries, 123, Chancellor Kent
says, it has been held that the guarantorof a note could'be discharged.
by the laches of the holder, as by neglect- to make demand of payment of the maker, ind give notice of non-payment to the guarantor;
provided the, maker was solvent when the note fell due, and became
insolvent'afterwards. The rule is not so strict as in the. case.of mere
negotiable paper; and the neglect to give notice must have produced.
some loss or prejudice to the guarantor.
The same principle'is laid down in the following cases: Phillips y.
Astling, , Taunt. 206; Swinyard v. "Bowes, 5,M. & S. 62; Van
Wert 7.. Woolley, 3 Barn. & Cressw. 439,
The rule is well settled that the guarantee of a promissory-note,
whose name does not appear on the note, is bound without nofice,
where 'the maker of the note was insolvent at its--maturity.. That
his lihbility continues' unless he jcan show he has sustained some prejudice, by want-of notice of a demand on'the maker of the note, and
non-payment.
In the case before us, there is no pretence that the defendants have
sustained apx injury from a neglect of the plaintiffs to make a de .
mand on. Chester. Haring for payment of the balances against him,
in the account 6urrent; or for the amount paid in discharge of the,
eight bills of exchange referred to in the declaration.
But if the defendants. could prove they had suffered damage by
the negl'ftt of the plaintiffs to make the demand and give notice, according to the case of Vanwart v. Woolley, 3 Barn. & Cress. 439,;
they could ,only be dischrged to the extent of the damage sustained'.
As before remarked, Haring died before any, of the promissory
notes dated 1st.May, 1829, became due; and .consequently, no demand on him for the payment of these notes could be made. From
.the facts in the case, it appears that the, defendants resided in Port
Gibson, the place where Haring lived; and it cannot be doubted that
they' had.knowledge of his death.
From. these considerations, it is clear that the district court erred
in. refusing to give-the first instruction asked by the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs also requested the court to charge that if the jury
believed that Chester Haring transferred all his property to Daniel

504

SUPREME COURT.
(Reynolds et al. v. Douglass ot al.1

Greenleaf, on the 11th April, 1829, and that Daniel Greenleaf at that
time was engaged to pay all the debts of the said firm, and to secure
the defendants from their liability on the letter of guaranty; and that
Daniel Greenleaf,, on 24th December, 1829, by deed of trust to one
of the defendants, James S. Douglass, transferred claims to the
amount of twenty-eight or nine thousand dollars, to secure the defendants for their liability on said letter of credit; then it is not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove, that the defendants were luly
notified of their liability on said, letter of credit: "which charge the
court refused to give.
The facts, hypothetically stated as the basis of this instruction, are
such, as if :found by the jury, must have had influence on their
minds; for they conduce to show that the defendants had received
knowledge of their responsibility under the letter of credit, and of
the circumstances of Haring. But as the instruction does not necessarily importthe insolvency of Haring, which, or his death, can
alone excuse the plaintiffs from making a demand on him, and giving
ilotice to the defendants of his failure to pay; the court did-not err in
declining to give the instruction. The facts supposed in the instruction might be adflaitted; and yet the ihsolvency of Haring, at some
subsequent period, viould not follow as a consequence.
Several instructions were given by the court, at the request of the
defendants' counsel, to which'the plaintiffs excepted; and we will
now consider them.
And first, the court charged the jury, that to entitle
,the plaintiffs
to recover on said letter of credit, they'must prove that notice had
been given in a reasonable time after said letter of credit had been
accepted by them to the defendants, that the same had been accepted. This instruction, being in conformity to the rule formerly laid
down by this Court in this case, was properly given. This notice
need not be proved to have been given in yriting, or in any particular form; but may be inferred by the jury from facts and circumstances which shall warrant such inference..
The court also instructed the jury, that if they believed from the
evidence that two of thedefendants, Going and Singleton, admitted
that the debt sued for was a just debt, and that the said two defendants stated that they would try to arrange the payment thereof, out
of the funds or effectsthat had been assigned by Daniel Greenleaf to
James: S. Douglass; and that the admission and declaration were
made in 1830, and that at said period no notice had been given-by

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Reynolds et al. v. Douglass 'et al.]

the plaintiffs to the defendants, that said guaranty had been accepted
by them; and that said defendants were uninformed at the time of
such admission and declaration of such failure to giye such notice;
that then such admission and declaration do not operate in law a
waiver of, and dispense with the necessity of such notice.
This instruction must have been hastily drawn; but we understand it as laying down the principle that a recognition of. their obligation to pay, by the defendants, under a supposed liability vhich,
did not, exist, from the facts of the case, and of which, facts they
were ignorant' would not be'a waiver of the notice. In this view,
the instruction was correctly given.
And the court further instructed the jury, that in the absence of
evidence of notice given in a reasonable time by the paintiffs, that
said letter of credit had been accepted by them, the mere acknowledgmen.t by the defendants, that the debt sued for is a just
debt, does not dispense with the necessity of such notice; but that to
dispense with such notice, there-must be evidence of an express and
unconditional promise by the defendants to pay, made under a full
knowledge that such notice had not been given.
This instruction is not founded upon the supposition that the defendants were ignorant of the necessity of a -notice to bind them;
and this ignorance, therefore, cannot be presumed. The proposition
then is, that although the defendants knew that a notice was necessary to bind them, and which had not been given; an acknowledgmerit of the debt and a- promise to pay, which is not express and
unconditional, would not dispense with notice. In giving this instruction, we think the court erred. A party to a note entitled to
notice, may waive it by a promise to see it paid;, or an acknowledgment that it must be paid; or a.promise that "he will set the matter
to rights;" or by a,qualified promise, having knowledge of the laches
of the holder. Hopes v. Alder, 6 East, 16; Selw. N. P. 323; H addock v. Beery, 7 East, 236; Rogers v. Stephens, 2 T. R. 713; Anson v. Baily, Bul. N. P. 276. In the case of Thornton v. Wynn, 1
Wheat. 183, tb- Court say: an acknowledgment of his liability, by
the endorser of a bill or note, and knowledge of his discharge by. the
laches of the holder, will amount to a waiver of notice.
In their fourth. instruction the court say, that a qualified or conditional promise, made by the defendants totpay the debt sued for,
which was rejected by the plaintiffs or their agent, is not a waiver of
VOL. XII.-3 S

SUPREME COURT.
[Reynolds et al. v. Douglass et al.]

the necessary notice from the plaintiffs to the defendants, that said
letter of credit had been accepted by them.
This instruction is somewhat vague in its language; but if it is to be
considered as laying down the rule, that a promise to pay the debt,
qpalified with a condition which was rejected by the plaintiffs, or their
agent; the court, were right in saying that it was not a waiiver 'of
notice.
In their fifth and last instruction, the court charge the jury /that to
"enable the plaintiffs to recover on said letter of credii 'they must
prove that a demand of payment had been made of Chester Haring,
the principal debtor, of the debt sued for; and in case 'of non-payment, notice should have been given in a reasonable time, to the defendants; and on failure of such proof, the defendants are in law
'discharged.
This instruction rests upon the necessity of a personal demand of
Waring by the plaintiffs. 'It has been already shown that this demand was. unnecessary in case of flaring's-insolvency; the in itruction was therefore, on the facts in the case, erroneous., The judgment
of the district court must be reversed; and the cause remanded 'for a
venire dd novo.
Mr. Justice

BALDWIN

dissented.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
'from the district court of the United States for the district of Mississippi,,and was argued by counsel. On consideration Whereof, it is
now here adjudged and ordered by this Court, that the judgment of
the said district court in this cause be, and the. same is hereby reversed and'annulled; and that this, cause be, and the same is hereby
remanded to the said district court, with directions to award a venwire
