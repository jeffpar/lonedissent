SUPREME COURT.

HENRY TOLAND,

PLAINTIIF IN -ERiOR V. HORATIO

SPRAGUE.

Process of foreign attachment cannot be properly issued by the circuit courts of the
United States, in cases where the defendant is domiciled abroad, or not found
within the district in which the process issues, so that it can be served upon him.
The true construction of the eleventh section of the, judiciary act of 1789, is, that
it did not mean to distinguish between those who are inhabitants, or found within
the district,-by process issuel out of the circuit court, and persons domiciled
abroad ; so as to protect the first, and leave the others not within the protection:
but even with regard to those who are within the United States, they should not
be liable to the process of the circuit courts 6f the United States, unless in one or
other of the predicaments stated in the clause. And as to all those who were not
within the United States, it was not in the contemplation of congress that they
would be at all subject, as defendants, to the process cf the circuit courts ; which
by reason of their being in a foreign jurisdiction, could not be served upon them;
and therefore there was no provision whatsoever in relation to them.
By the general provisions of the laws of the United States: 1. The circuit courts can
issue no.process beyond the limits of their districts. 2: Independently of positive
legislation, the process can only be served upon persons, within the same listricts.
3. The acts of congress adopting the state process, adopt the form and modes of
service only, so far as the persons are rightfully within ftle reach of such process;
and did not intend to enlarge the spliere of the jurisdiction of the circuit courts.
4. The right to attach property to compel the appearance of" persons, can properly
be used only in cases in which such persons are amenable to the process of the
circuit court, in personam; that is, where they are inhabitants, or found within
.he United States ; and not where they are aliens, or citizens resident abroad, at
the cpmmencement of the suit, and have no inhabitancy here.
In the case of a person being amenable to process, in personam, an attachment
against his property cainot be issued against him; except as a part of, or togetherwith. process to be served upon his person.
The circuit court of , each district, sit within and for that district, and are bounded
by its local limits. Whatever may be the extent of the jurisdiction of the circuit
court over the subject matter of suits, in respect to' persons and property, it can
only b exercised within the limits of the district. Congress might have authorized civil process from any circuit court to have run into any state of the Union.
It hab n6t done so. It has not, in terms, authorized any civil process to run into any
other district; with the single exception of subpoBnas to witnesses within a-limited
distance. In regard to final process, there are two cases, and only two, in which
writs of execution can now by law be served in any other district than that in
which the judgment waA rendered; one in favour of private persons in another
district of the same state ; and the other in'favour of the United States, in any
part of the United States.
A party against whose property a foreign attachment has issued in a circuit court
of the United States, although the circuit court had no right to issue such an at.
tachment, having appeared- to the suit, and pleaded to issue, cannot afterwards
deny the jurisdiction of the couLt. The party had, as a personal privilege, a right
tq refuse to appear; but it was also competent to him to waive the objection.

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

301

[Toland v. Sprague.]
The judiciary act of 1789 authorizes the Supreme Court to issue writs of error to
bring up final judgments or decrees in a civil -action, &c. The decision of the
circuit court unon a rule or motion is not of that character. Such decisions are
not final jiodgments.
No principle of law is better settled, than, that to bring a case, within the exception
of 'merchandise accounts between merchant and merchant, in the statute of limitations, there must be an account; and that, an~accountopen or current: that it .
must be a direct concern of trade: that liquidated denaiids on bills and notes,
which are only traced up to the trade or merchandise, are too remote to come
within this description. But when the account is stated between the parties, or
when any thing shall have been done by them, whih by their implied admission
is equivalent to a settlement, it has then become an ascertained debt. Where
there is a settled account, that becomes the cause of action, and not the original
accourit; although it grew out of an account between merchant and merchant,
J-heir factors or servants.
T. shipped a quantity of merchandise by,P. to Gibraltar, who on arriving there
. placed the goods in the hands of S., and- received advances from S. upon them.
In 1825, S cold the goods and transmitted an account sales, as of the merchandise
received from P. to T., who received it in September, 1825, stating the balance of
the proceeds to be two'thousand five hundred and seventy-eight dollars. T. in
1825 wrote to S., directing him to remit the amount to him, deducting one thousand dollars, which had been advanced by S. on the goods, and. which had been
remitted by P. to T. S. refused to make the remittance, alleging that P. was
largely indebted to him. No suit was instituted by T. against S. until August,
1834. The account was a stated account; and the statute of limitations applied
to it.
The mere rendering an account does not make it a stated account; but if the other
party receives it, admits the correctness of the items, claims the balance, or offers
1o pay it, as it may be in his favour or against him, then it becomes a stated
account. It is not at all important that the account was not made out between the
plaintiff and the defendant; the plaintiff having received it, having iiade no complaint as to the items or the balance; but, on the contrary, having claimed that
balance, thereby'adopted it, and by his own act treated it as a stated account.
T. shipped merchandise consigned to P. as supracargo; P. put the goods into the
hands of S., a merchant of Gibraltar, as the merchandise of T., and received an
advance upon them. S*.having sold the merchandise, rendered an account of the
sales, stating the sales to have. been made by order of P., and crediting the proceeds in nccount with P. The account came into the hands of T. in 1825; and
h6 claimed the balance of the proceeds from S., deducting the advance made by
S. to P.; and payment of the same was refused by P. Held, that as T. had a
right in 1825 to call on S. to account, and as no suit was instituted against S. until
1834; S. having always denied his liability to T. for the amount of the sales, from
the time of the demand; the statute of limitations was a bar to an action to recover the amount from S.
The effect and nature of an averment in a plea put in by a defendant, when it is not
essential to the plea.
Where the items of an account stated were not disputed, but were admitted, and payment of the same demanded; it was not taking the question of fact, whether the
account was a stated account, from the jury: for the.court to instruct the jury that
the account was a stated account.

SUPREME COURT
[Toland v. Sprague.]

ERROR to the circuit court df the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania.
This action was commenced on the 'fifth day -of August, 1834,
by the plaintiff in error, by process of foreign attachment, in the
circuit court for the eastern district of Pennsylvania. The writ of
attachment sta4ed the defendant, Horatio Sprague, to be a citizen of
the state of Massachusetts, and the plaintiff to be a citizen of the
state of Pennsylvania. The attachment vas served on the' property
of the defendant on the sixth day of August, 1834, in the hands of
Mr. John M'Crea, Mr. S. Brown, and Mr. P. Lajus, residents i'n the
city of Philadelphia. At the following term ot the circuit court,
the counsel fo the defendant moved to quash the attachment; which
motion was overruled by the court.
The record showed that Horatio Sprague, although' stated to be a
citizen of the state of Massachusetts, was at the time of the commencement of the suit, and for some years before, had, been a resident at Gibraltar; where he was extensiveJy engaged as a merchant.
The 'defendant entered special bail to the attachment; and having
appeared and pleaded to the same, the case was tried by a jury on
the twenty-first day of November, 1836; and a verdict, under the
charge of the circuit court, was rendered for the defendant, on which
a judgment was entered by the court.
The plaintiff at the trial took a bill of exceptions to the charge of
the court, stating in full all the evidence given to the jury in 'the
case. The plaintiff prosecuted this writ of error.
The plaintiff declared in assumpsit, on three counts against the
defendant: First, charging the delivery of certain articles of merchandise, upon a promise to account and pay over the proceeds of the
sale of the same; alleging a sale thereof by the defendant, and a breach
of promise, in not paying or accounting for the same. Second, a
count in indebitatus assumpsit: and third, on an account stated: The
third count was afterwards, on the application of the plaintiff to the
court, ' struck out of -the declaration. The defendant pleaded the
general issue, and also the statute of limitations. The plaintiff replied that, at the time of the transactions with the defendant, in
which this suit was brought, the defendant-was a merchant and the
factor of the plaintiff, and "as such had the care and administration
of the money, goods, wares, and merchandise, in the said declaration
mentioned, of the said Henry; and he merchandised and made profit

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Totand v. Sprague.)

of for the said Henry, and to render a reasonable'account to the said
Henry, when he, the. said Horatio, should be thereunto, afterwards
required; pnd'that the said money, in thE5 said several promises and
undertakings in the said declaration mentioned, became due and payable on trade had between the said Horatio and the said Henry, as
merchants and merchant and factor, and wholly concerned the trade
of merchandise between him; the said Henry, as a merchant, and the
said Horatio as a merchant and factor of him, the said Henry, to
wit, at the district aforesaid: and the said Henry further says, that
no account or accounts whatever of the said money, goods and merchandise, in the said declaration mentioned, or any part thereof,
was, or were ever stated, settled, or adjusted between him the said
Henry."
To this replication'the defendant rejoined, stating that
he was not
the factor of'the plaintiff; nor did the said money, iti the said several
supposed promises and undertakings, in the said declaration mentioned, become due and payable in trade had between the said
Horatio Sprague and-the plaintiff, as merchant and merchant and
factor, in manner and form as the plaintiff had alleged.
The bill of exceptions set out at large the evidence given on the
trial of the cause. It consisted of a letter, dated Philadelphia, September, 25, 1824, from the plaintiff to Charles Pettit, by which certain
goods and merchandise, th6 property of the plaintiff, shipped on board
of the William Penn, bound to Gibraltar, was consigned to him for
sale, and stating the. manner'in which returns for the same were to
be made; letters from Charles Pettit to the plaintiff, relative to the
shipment, and a statement of remittances made to him by Charles
Pettit, with an account sales of some of the merchandise; -also two
bills of exchange, one for'five hundred and thirty dollars seventeen
cents, the amount of the proceels of sales of eleven hogsheads of
tobacco, and a bill of exchange for one thousand dollars, both drawn
by Horatio Sprague, the defendant, on persons in the United States,
to the order of Charles Pettit, and by him endorsed to the plaintiff.
By a letter 'from Charles Pettit to the plaintiff, dated at Gibraltar,
December, 1824, after communicating the sales of the eleven hogsheads of tobacco, and the enclosure of the bills, and stating that the
bill for one thousand dollars was to be considered as an advance on
his shipment, he informed the plaintiff:
"I shall sail from this to-morrow, in the ship William Penn, for
Savannah, and have left the following instructions with my friend,

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v.Sprague.1

Mr. Sprague, regarding your property left by me in his hands:
'With respect to the gunpowder tea, cassia, and crape dresses,
shipped by [Henry Toland, you will please to dispose of them as you
may think most-for the interest of the shipper, and remit the amount
to him, in bills on.the-United States; forwarding me account of sales
of the same.'"
By a letter addressed, by Charles Pettit to the defendant, Mr.
Sprague; written at Gibraltar, on the 18th December, 1825; he ays,
among other things:
"By your account current rendered' this day, a balance stands
against me of five thousand five hundred and seventy-four dollars
thirty-one cents; to meet which you have in your possession 550
barrels superfine flour, on my account entire, my half interest of 372
barrels flour; an invoice of crapes, &c.. amounting to two thousand
and twenty dollars; 100 ten-catty boxes gunpowder tea; 500 bundles
cassia; and 2 cases supev satin Mandarin crape dresses; containing
101 dresses.

"With respect to the gunpowder tea, cassia, and crape dresses,
shipped by H. Toland, you will be pleased to dispose of them as you
may think most for the interest of the shipper, and remit the amount
to hini in a bill on the United States; forwarding me account salesof the same "
On the 6th of January, 1825, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant,
from Philadelphia, "I am expecting soon to bear the result of my
shipment by the William Penn, and hoping it will be favourable."
On, the 22d February, 1825, the plaintiff addressed the following
letter to the-defendant;
"Philadelphia, February22, 1825.
"MR. HORATIO SPRAGUE, Gibraltar.
"Dear Sir,-By the ship William Penn, I consigned to Mr.
Charles Pettit 100 boxes gunpowder tea, a quantity of cassia, I1
hogsheads Kentucky tobacco, and 2 cases Mandarin robes. I directed
Mr. Pettit to Make the returns of'this shipment immediately on his
arrival at Gibraltar, as follows: If quicksilver could be had at forty
cents, then the whole amount in said article; if not, to ship the whole
amount in dollars, by the first vessel for this port, or New York; or
if good bills of the United States could be had on more favourable
terms for a remittance, then to make the return in bills. Mr. Pettit
promised a strict compliance with all these things; but, since the

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Toland v. Spraguo.]

sailing of the William Penn from this port, I hbve never received a
line from him. I have heard of his arrival in Savannah, and of his
proceeding to Charleston; but 1 have riot yet been favoured with a
sing'e letter from him.
" As my property may be left in your hands by him, unsold, I beg
of you to follow the directions given to him, as herein detailed, and
make the remittance direct to me. I have particularly to beg your
attention to this lmatter, and to remit as early as possible."
The bill of exceptions also contained letters from the defendant
to the plaintiff, written at Gibraltar, commencing on the 18th January, 1825, to February 22, 1827; and other correspondence of the
plaintiff with the defendant, up tb an anterior date.
The letters of the plaintiff assert the liability of the defendant to
him for the whole amount of the shipment made to Charles Pettit;
deducting the two bills of exchange; one for five hundred and thirty
dollars seventeen cents, and the other for one thousand dollars; the
balance of the sales being one thousand five hundred and seventynine dollars.
The letter from the defendant to the plainff, of the 18th January,
1825, informs the 'plaintiff, "that Charles Pettit had left Gibraltar on
the 19th of December, and had placed in his hands,' for sale for his
account, , invoice of gunpowder tea, cassia, and crape dresses; with
directions to dispose of them as he may judge most for his interest;
which shall have my best attention."
Letters written afterwards inform the plaintiff of the state of the
markets at Gibraltar; and on the 7th of June, 1825, the defendant
wrote to the plaintiff, " I have closed the 'sales of the crapes and
cassia, left by IMlr. Pettit some time since; and settled his account."
On being informed by the plaintiff, that he was held liable to him
for the proceeds of the shipment, per the William Penn, the defendant addressed the following letter to the plaintiff:
"Gibraltar, October 24, 1825.
Dear Sir,-I have just received your letter of 12th September,
which I hasten to reply to. It would appear) by your letter, that
Mr. Pettit's agency here Was not so full as his own instructions to
me gave me to expect. The property which he has brought and
consigned to me at various times, has ever been delivered over to me
with invoices, in his own name; and I have ever been punctilious in
iollowing his instructions, sometimes in remitting to one, sometimes
VOL. XII.-2 Q

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

to anothei, and on which property I Was always ready, and at various times did advance sums of money; but how he, Mr. Pettit, appropriated this money, it was not my province to inquire;, he niight
have remitted it to you, or any one dlse.- Here follows the other
part of his instructions of the date of the 18th December, which you
appear to have overlooked; but which must establish in your mind
the nature of Mr. Pettit's transactions here. Had you have consigned your property t6 me, instead of.Mr. Pettit, I should then
have beenaccountable to you; but it cannot be expected that I am to
guaranty the conduct of your agent, who 'always is accountable to
you for his conduct: Here follows the extract of his order of, 18th
December, 1824: "By your account current, rendered, this day, a
balance stands againgt me of five thousand five hundred and seventyfour dollars and thirty-one cents; to meet which, you havi in your.
possessin.five hundred and fifty barrels of superfine flour, on my ac,count entire, my half interest cf three hundred and sevehty-two barrels of flour, and invoice of crapes, &c., amounting to two thousand
and twentyollars, one hundred ten-catty boxes gunpowder tea, fivb!
hundred bundles cassia, and two cases superior satin Mandarin crape
dresses, containing one hundred and ,one dresses," &c. &c.
This paragraph,'I repeat, cannot but convince you that all my.advances to Mr. Pettit were on the various property whibh he placed
in my hands for sale. It is vbry true I corresponded with your good
self on the subject of the articles which. you entrusted to the managejuent of Mr. Pettit; and-it is no less true, I did the same-with him,
and from time to time promised him account; which I never did.to
you; and,-until his last -iisitto this, did not close the sales of the articles, when; at his particular request, closed every account before he
'left this. This explanation, I trust, will prove satisfactory, so much
so, that I may continue to enjoy your confidence."
The letter of the plaintiff of Philadelphia, January 4th, 1826, repeats and insists on the liability of the defendant to him; to which
the defendant gave the following reply.
"Gibraltar, :February 10, 1826.
"Dear 'Sir,-I am this moment in receipt of your letter of 4th
ultimo, per Charles, and from -your reference to my letter of 18th
Janary; 1825, have looked into: the same. That I was aware the
property handed over to me by Mr. Pettit did n't belong to himself
there isno question; but on what terms you and others consignxed it

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

307

LT'oland v. Sprague.]

to him, is not for me to inquire. On his arrival, he submitted to me
inyoices of several *.hiprhents, required advances, and gave orders for
sales; and on his leaving this, asyou may suppose, directed me to correspond with the different shippers by him; which, in my opinion,
was very proper, and could not in the faintest degree lessen my
claim to the property, on whic'h I had made liberal, yes, more than
liberal advances; so much so, that Mr. Pettit is over two thousand
dollars my debtor: yet so particularly desirous am I to satisfy your
mind, as I am in possessiofi'of all the original papers, letters, &c.
connected with the business; I have no hesitation in submitting the
question to any tiiro respectable mercalnts here, one to be appointed
by you, the other by myself, and to their decision I shall most readily subscribe; or if you are willing to leave the business to me, I will
submit every paper to two disinterested merchants, and they shall andress you on the subject; andthe affair'shall be settled to ouir satisfaction.
"Herewith duplicate of my respects of 28th ultimo, since which I
have delivered a part of your hyson skin tea, at three and a half rials
per pound. This parcel has been sold off, and if no complaints of its
quality be made hereafter, 1 shall'be glad."
The bill-of exceptions also contained a number of accounts sales
of merchandise made by the defendant, by order'of Charles Pettit;
and accounts current with him, commencing in 1822'.. The only account which was the subject of notice in the charge of the circuit
court, was one dated at Gibraltar, June 30, 1825, of the property
of the plaintiff left in the hands of the defendant on the 18th December, 1824. This was an account sales, showing a balance of two thousand five hundred and seventy-eight dollars and eleven conts. The
account sales was stated to be:
"Sales of merchandise received 3d No.vember, 1824, ex ship William Penn, William West master, from Philadelphia, by order of Mr.
Charles Pettit, for account and risk of the concerned, per.Horatio
Sprague, Gibraltar.
Gibraltar,June 30, 1825."
By the account current between the defeiidant and Charles Pettit,
dated "July 6, 1825,''in which credit was given for the nett proceed'
of the sales of June 30, 1825, a balance appeared to be due from
Charles Pettit to the defendant, of one thousand four hundred and six
dollars and
cents.
The bill of exceptions contained no other
account in which the

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

sales of the shipment made by the plaintiff by the William Penn
were stated; nor did it contain any account rendered by the defendant to the plaintiff, relating thereto.
Tbe circuit court charged the jury:
That there being a plea of the statute of limitation, the plaintiff
must by' his replication bring himself within the exception concerning merchants' accounts, in the said statute, or must fail. To be within
the said exception, such accounts must concern trade and merchandise, and must also contain mutual demands, and must be an open
6anid running account, and must be such for which an action of account Would lie; and must be between merchant and merchant, their
factors or servants, not merely between those who hold their goods
under an obligation to account.
Here the plaintiff claimed one thousand five hundred and seventynine dollars, the balanceof sales of property, as per account sales
June 30, 1825, amounting to 'two thousand five hundred and seventy.nine dollars. Credit by one thousand dollars-Bill on Pearson. The
plaintiff -and .defendant agree in the amount of sales, and no item is
objected to.
Thus far the account is a stated' one, not being objected to for ten
years; if any balance is due, it is ascertained by mutual consent.
There is no mutual account between them, nor an open one, and
there can be no new account open between them. The contest does
not depend on an account, but on who has a right to a liquidated balance, admitted by defendant to be in his hands as the proceeds of
plaintiff's property: plaintiff claims it as his own; the defendant
claims to apply it to a debt due by Pettit.
On the pleadings, the question is not who has a right to the money;
but whether plaintiff ip not barred by the statute.
The plaintiff had not made out a case which exempts him from
the statute. If Sprague had rendered the account sales to the plaintiff, and admitted the balance to be payable to him, that would not
bring plaintiff within the exception.
The plaintiff had a complete right of action, on demand of a settled balance; and he made this demand in 1825, and the statute would
then begin to run. The plaintiff's only claim is for a precise balance;
and this would not have been the mutual open account current between merchant and merchant, concerning the trade of'merchandise
between plaintiff and defendant. It did not become so by defendant
claiming to retain the balance for Pettit's debt; nor did it change the

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

309

[Toland v. Sprague]

nature of the transaction, or.'make the cause more a matter of account, than if he admitted the plaintiff's right to it.
The only question is, who is entitled to the balance of a settled
account. Admitting, then, that defdndant was the factor of the plaintiff, he has failed in making out his replication as matter of law; it
was hot a case of trust, not embraced by statute.
Taking the account, then, as one where defendant was factor for
plaintiff, bound to account to him and pay him the balance, and
having no authority to apply the proceeds to Pettit's debt, and plaintiff not bound by receipt of one thousand dollars: the nature of the
transaction does not bring it within the exception, being for a liquidated balance admitted; and by the correspondence between the
parties, the controversy brought to a contest for the balance, this
can be an exception only on the ground of merchants being privileged characters.
The correspondence between, the parties, so long ago as early in
the year 1826, shows that the question between them was not about
the account, or any item in it, but on the right of Mr. Sprague to retain the admitted balance to repay. the advances he made to Pettit:
that was the only question in -dispute between them; and it is the
only one now, and has so continued for more than ten years.
This view makes it unnecessary to consider the other interesting
questions as to the powers of agents, factors, supercargoes, pledging,
and of sub-agents; the jury are to take the direction of the court
in the question, which is a matter of law: and so left the same to
the jury.
The case was argued by Mr. Gilpin and Mr. Hare, for the plaintiff in error; and by Mr. Gerhard, with whom was Coxe, for the defendant.
For the plaintiff, the following errors were assigned:
1. That the court charged the jury upon an issue which not only
did not appear upon, but was excluded bythe pleadings; upon which
the cause was not tried; and which was not raised by any of the
counsel in argument.
2 That 'whether any demand for an account had ever been made,
by plaintiff upon defendant; whether any account had ever been rendered by defendant to plaintiff; and whether any. account was an
account stated between plaintiff and defendant, were all questions for

SUPREME COURT.
(Toland v, Sprague.]

the jury; and that the court erred in withdrawing the same from the
jury, and giving them a positive direction' thereon.
3., That supposing the )questions set forth in the foregoing error
assigned to be for the court; the court erred in charging the jury that,
in point of law, there was any demand made on defendant by plaintiff for an account: that the defendant had ever rendered an account
to the plaintiff; and that there was an account stated between the
plaintiff and the defendant, so as to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit
of the exception in the statute of limitations concerning merchants'
accounts.
4. Because the' charge of the court was against the law and the
evidence.
Mr. Hare, for the plaintiff in error:
The defendant in error objects to this Court's jurisdiction, as well
as to that of the court below, on the ground that he is withinr the
11th 'section of the judiciary act of 1789, which, enacts, that "no
civil suit shall be brought in the circuit courts against an inhabitant
of-the United'States, byany original process, in any other district than
that whereof he is an'inhabitant,or in which he shall be found at
the time of serving the writ."
This question was raised in the court below, by means of a rule
to show cause why the writ should not be quashed, and decided
against the defendant after argument, and on affidavits, showing
that the defendant was a citizen of Massachusetts, and had been for
more than twqnty years an inhabitant of Gibraltar.
We contend: 1. That the matter of such a defence, as it ousts the
court. below, or 'tliis Court of its jurisdiction, by reason of a personal privilege, must be duly pleaded; and if waived in the order of
pleading, is lost.
2. That the defendant, not being an inhabitant of the United States,
but residing in another country, is, therefore, not within the lth
section, and is liable to foreign attachment.
As to the first point, the 11th section confers a personal privilege
which, like all other personal exemptions,-must be pleaded; because
his right to it is examinable, and nothing appears on the record to
found a doubt of the jurisdiction. And as it is a personal privilege,,
it may be waived, in which case the court has jurisdiction. As it
is merely dilatory, it is not to be favoured. Harrison v. Rowan, 1
Peters' C. C. R. 489-;' Kitchen v. Williamson, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 85;

311

[Toland v. Sprague.]

Logan v. Patrick, 5,:Cranch, 288. And havipg pleaded in bar, he
cannot now raise the question of his privilege in this Court.
2d. It appeared, upon affidavit in the court below, that the defendant is not an inhabitant of the United States, has not been such for
twenty years, but is domiciled in' Gibraltar. He is not, therefore,
within the words or meaning of the I Ith section; which covers none
but inhabitants of the United States
The judiciary act gives to the circuit court cognizance of all suits,
of a civil nature, between citizens of differeqt states; which is the
case ofthe parties to this action; or citizen and alien. And the act
to regulate processes, gives to the same courts the same processes as
are used in Lhe state cpurts of the particular district.
The process in this case was a foreign attachment,, which is used
in the state courts of Pennsylvania. The !lth section restrains the
service of process upon, an inhabitant of the United States, except
in his own district, or in that where he is at thle time of writ
served.
Where a general power is giVen, and a particular restriction
afterwards imposed, the restriction must be construed strictly, or it
may override'the power.
Here the character of the process and that of the suit are within
both acts. The question, thenig on the restriction: but the defendant
is not an inhabitant of the United States, and therefore not within it.
The spirit of the restriction-was to save inhabitants of the United
States, whether citizens or aliens, from a greater hardship than either
would be subjected to in the state courts; that, namely, of being
called to answer in a distant tribunal, by virtue of the general-poweof the federal courts, as extending all over the Union. But this
consideration cannot apply to the case of foreign attachment against
a non-resident, since that process is used in the state courts; and
would have lain against this defendant, and cannot lie against an inhabitant of the state or district. If the attachment had issued from
the state courts-, the defendant might have transferred it to :the circuit court by the terms of 12th section of the judiciary act. 3 4iarr.
& M'Hen. 556, 557.
It has been the practice in Pennsylvania to issue foreign attachments from the circuit courts against aliens non-resident.
The word inhabitantin the act does not mean citizen. If so,
aliens resident would be.exposed to a hardship from Which citizens
are exempted. The argument for the defendant must mean that,

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

:because the defendant is a citizen of Massachusetts, he is therefore
an inhabitant of the United States; that is, that inhabitant and citizen are:the same thing. In some cases, it is true, the residence of
a citizen of the United States within the United States, determines
of what state he is'a citizen, as to the question of jprisdictidn of the
United States' courts: as in Cooper v. Galbraith, 3 Wash. 553; Buller v. Farnworth, 4 Wash. 101. But in this case, the citizen of the
United States is an inhabitant of another country. He is not thereby divested of his citizenship; which signifies his political relations,
and does not depend on his will. 2 Cranch, 318; United States v.
Gillies, I Peters' 0, C. R. 161; 4 Tuck. BIackst. 101; 4 Am. Law
Journal, 462; 2 Ci-anch, 120; 8 T. R. 45; Hale's Com. Law, 184;
Vattel, 162, 318. But he is not-an inhabitant of the United States;
he is such of another country,: and he is to be, dealt with as such in a
question of jurisdiction in this Court. 2 Peters, 450; 2 Rob. Adm.
Rep. 267; 3 Rob. Adm. Rep. 23; 2 Bos. & Pul. 229; 1 Binn. 351.
And if foreign attachment will lie against an alin non-resident of
this country,, there is no reason why it should not lie against a citizen noh-resident.
If leaded, that he was an inhabitant of the-United States, and issue
had been joined, the verdict must have been that he was not an inhabitant: and if so found, there is nothing to take away the jurisdiction. of the circuit court.
The first error is, that the court charged upon an issue not only
not appearing upon, but conclu ded by th pleadings.
The charge of the court assumes that there had been an account
stated between the plaintiff and defendant. None was alleged at the
trial. The action was for the proceeds of a shipment placed :.- the
hands of the defendant, by the plaintiffs agent. The merits were
not noticed in the charge of the court, and are therefore not material.
The statute of limitations was not relied on by the counsel for the
defendant, at the trial. The cause was tried upon the issues, and we
contend the charge was upon what was not in issue.
The declaration contains two counts; -for money had and received,
and for not rendering an account. There was origirally a third
count, viz., on an account stated; which was struck out before replication, upon a rule granted by the court. The'defendant pleaded non
assumpsit, and the statute of limitations; which, in Pennsyl-vania, by
a defect of legislation, does not save 'the right of the- plaintiff against
an absent defendant.

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

The plaintiff took issue, on the fE-st plea; and to the second, replied, the exception in the statute concerning merchants' accounts;
and alleged in it that no account had ever been rendered or stated
between the parties. Godfrey v. Saunders, 1 Wils. 79; 1 Burrows,
317, 557; 558; 9 Serg. and Rawle, 29.
It being a construction of
this, exception that it does not include accounts stated, it was proper
to allege they were not stated.
The defendant rejoined that plaintiff and defendant were 'ot !nerchants, &c. It admitted, therefore, there was no account stated, as
it did not deny it: for, whatever is traversable, and not traversed, is
admitted; 2 Starkie's Rep. 62; Stephen on Pleading, 255, 258; Ap-

pendi, 44, 54. The verdict, if stated at large on the record,
would have been that the parties were merchants, which, as a fact,
was not doubted. If stated at large, "under. the direction of the
court," as expressed in the record to have been found it must have
been that there was an account stated between the parties. But it is
a rule that a verdict cannot contradict the issue nor admissions in

the pleadings. 5 Bac. Abr. 322; 2 Mod. 5; 2 Ld. Raym. 864. The
learned judge, therefore) clearly erred when he charged the jury that
the question in the pleadings, was, whether an account had or had
not been stated; since such a verdict would have been a nullity.
Upon the issue, the plaintiff proved the amount owing to him by
the written admission of the defendant, which admission did not include the right of the plaintiff to that amount. If the rejoinder had
been thiit there was an account stated, his course would have been
different, and it would have lain on the defendant to prove such an
account; which attempt, if it failed, would have destroyed his de-fence on the merits.
The second error assigned is, that the court took away from the
jury the question, whether there was or was not an account stated;
and charged positively that a. particular paper was not such.
The replication denied an account stated; the rejoinder admitted
there was none; and none was alleged or produced in evidence. The
plaintiff was entitled to be heard against the construction of any paper,
as such account. The court charged that the account sales of June
30th, 1825, was an ac )unt stated betw~eii tha parties; and did not
state that that account was not sent by defendant to plaintiff, but was
given by defendant to Pettit, who was not then the plaintiff's agent;
that the defendant always denied his liability to account to the plainVoL. XIL.-2 R

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.)

tiff; and affected to treat Pettit as the owner of the goods; and that
the account was given by Pettit to the plaintiff, as showing what disposition he ha'd made of the goods. We contend that this was not
an account stated, in point of fact; 'and that the jury were the judges
of the character of the paper: for it was not a question of the constinction of a paper, nor of the meaning of a phrase:.'but of afact,
whether'this paper was sent, and received as an account stated; and
it was a :matter of argument to. the jury, whether an account sales
can be, in any case, an acvount stated, inasmuch as it shows no
balance between the parties: and *whether the refusal of the defendant to account, and his allegation that be had never intended to account with plaintiff; did not destroy the character which the court
gave to this paper as an account stated.
The third error assigned is, that -the court assumed and charged
that therie was an account stated between the parties.
Supposing that the issue had been on the allegation th, t no account was started, and that the -decision of any'paper produced as
such, belonged to. the court--We contend that nothing was produced'in evidence, which deserved that character in law or fact; so
as to bar the plaintiff of the exception in the statute of limitations
concerning merchant§' accounts.
What are alleged as constituting the account stated, are a demand'
by the plaintiff on defendant, for 'a spedific sum, which he had incidentally learned from a third person, was the proceeds of his goods;
and t~le account sales which contained that amount.
We agree, that if accounts 'between merchants are stated, they are
within the statute. 1 Ventr. 89; Ibid. 865; 1 Mod. 269; and cases
referred to in Wilkinson ofn Limit. 30, et seq.; Blanchard on Limit.
88,.et seq. And further, that in accounts between others than mer "
chants, or since Spring v. Craig's Exr's., 6 Peters, 151; 6 Term Rep.
193; if between merchants, And not concerning the traffic of merehants; to bar the statute, an item must be within six years.
We contend that open accounts between merchants, are within
the exception; and further, that accounts closed by cessation of
dealings, are open accounts; but the pleadings must state accounts
to-be open. 1 Saunders' Rep. 127; 6 Term Rep. 193; 5 Cranch,
'15; 2 Dall. 254; 2 Yeates, 105; 5 Johns. C. R. 526; 19 Ves. 180;

The accounts must consist of more than one item, and of more.

.than one transaction ;: and must, in general, contain mutual credits;
but not as between merchant and factor: for there the course of trade
may be, that the factor has only to receive and dispose o the goods;
and remit their proceeds. Between a merchant and'his factor, there
can be no reciprocal demands in buying arid selling, such as exist
between merchant and merchant. A stated account is a clear statement of accounts, justified by signatures, as exhibiting approbation.
2 Young on Invoices, 37; none such is pretended. An acdount
current may become an account stated, by the silence of the party
receiving it. 2 Vern. 76; 2 Ves. 'sen., 239. But as soon as the
plaintiff here learned that the defendant had sold his goods, he demanded the proceeds. The defendant refused them, claiming to be
entitled to them; he refused to acknowledge the plaintiff as owner,
or to account with him: he did not send him account sales: he made
up, three years after this transaction, an accourit which contbined na
item of it: and-he admits in'the pleadings, and on the trial, that he
nevei has stated an account with him. If an account had never
been stated, it is impossible .to say that the plaiptiff did not object to
it. He claimed'an amount which* he learned was the proceeds of
his goods; the defendant retained it, and the plaintiff objected to his
retaining it. He could not do more. The court therefore erred, in
saying that the account h~d been unobjected to for ten years; and
erred equally in saying that it was for the plaintiff to make out his
replication that no account had. been stated: an allegation, which, if
admitted, (as it was,) was beyond dispute; and if denied, put the burthen on the defendant, the plaintiff asserting a negative, the defendant an affirmative. No account stated was or is pretended on behalf of the defendant. None was alleged or produced. Nor, under
the pleadings, was any admissible in evidence. The fat that the
plaintiff had in his possession the account sales of his goods, did not
conclude him from asserting his right to the proceeds; even if it concluded him from disputing the amount. It was, in,'any sense, no
more that, accidefital knowledge; and not being communicated to
him by the defendant, cannot be said to constitute an account stated,
between the plaintiff and defendant.
Mr. Gerhard for the defendant:
It becomes the duty of the counsel for the defendant in error, not
only to maintain that the errors assigned by the plaintiff cannot be
sustained, but further to show that if the plaintiff could prove hin-

self entitled to'a reversal of the judgment of the circuit court, that,
from a want of jurisdiction, this Court ought not to award a venire
de novo. Bingham v. Cabot, 3 Dali. 19; Ketland v. The Cassius, 2
Dall. 368. The circuit court had n~o jurisdiction of this cause, because:
1. The circuit courts of the United States have no jurisdiction
out of their respective districts; and hence no foreign attachment
will lie in a circuit court of the United States.
2. The judiciary act of 1789, in express terms, forbids the exercise of jurisdiction assumed in this case by the circuit court.
1st. The circuit courts of the United States have no jurisdiction
of actions of foreign attachment.
An action of foreign attachment is in direct contravention of the
principles of the -common law; and in every state in which the
action will lie, it depends for its shape and character and proceedings
upon the statutes of that state. Hereafter it will be necessary to
nqtice, m'ore particularly, the Pennsylvania action of foreign attachment. It is sufficient at present to say, that in Pennsylvania it is
a mode of commencing actions against a debtor, who is not a resident of the state; nor at the time the attachment issued within the
bounds of the state. Serg. on Attacb. 55, 61. Now, certainly
it would seem, until congress shall give the federal courts power
to exercise jurisdiction over persons o&it of the districts to which
their jurisdictions are respectively confined, by their very constitutioni, that no state law like this can be recognised in a federal
court; and such is the deliberate opinion of one of the judges of this
Court. Piquet v. Swan, 5 Mason, 39, 41, 48, 50. 2 Dall. 396. If
this position be correct, then the case must be dismissed; for the
record shows the nature of the action and of the service of the writ:
and the laws of Pennsylvania which are of judicial cognizance, prove
that the defendant could not have been within the state at the time
of the service of the process, even if the return of the marshal had
been less explicit.,
2dly. The judiciary. act of 1789, in express terms, forbids the exer-,
,cise of jurisdiction assumed in this case by the circuit court. Seetion-eleventh, points out the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the
United States, and then proceeds: ".But no person shall be arrested
in one district for trial in another, in any civil action, before a circuit
or district court. And no civil suit shall be brought before either of
said courts against an inhabitant of the United States, by any origi-

5ANITARY TERM, 183S.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

nal process in _in other district, than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in whicihe shall be found at the time of serving the writ."
As it has been decided by this Court, that this provision merely
confers a personal privilege on a defendant, which he may waive;
it will be my effort to show; first, that the defendant has not waived
his privilege, if he'have any; and, secondly, that the defendant is
entitled to the privilege secured by this provision; that thissuit
violates that privilege; and that the record shows both the privilege
and the violation.
1. The defendant has not waived his privilege, if he have any.
To rhaintain this, it will be necessary to examine into the nature
of the Pennsylvanlia action of foreign attachment; and this will be
done as briefly as possible. As has been already stated,'it is a'mode
of commencing actions against a debtor who is not a resident of the
state, nor, at the time the attachment issued, within the bounds of the
state. Serg. on Attach. 55, 61.
The defendant in the attachnn.t cannot put in any defence, unless he appears and gives bail to the action, and submits his person by
so doing to the jurisdiction of the court. Serg. on Attach. 131.
Otherwise the court will give judgment against him by default, at the
third term after, the attachment has been issued; and the plaintiff
may proceed by scire facias against the garnishee, to apply the goods
attached to the payment of his the plaintiff's claim. Serg. on Attach.
21.
But if there be any irregularity, in the attachment, as if the defendant be not the subject of an attachment, for instance, if he be within
the bounds of the statei the proper mode of taking advantage of
such irregularity, is by.making a summary application to the court~to
quash the attachment. By entering the bail to the action, the only
terms upon which he is allowed to plead, he waives the irregularity.
Serg. on Attach. 139.
As soon as the defendant could, he made such an application to
the 'circuit court. The affidavit shows, accurately, the nature of the
application. The point was argued; and after considerable hesitation, the court decided that they would sustain the writ, though the
defendant was described in it, &c. as a citizen of Massachusetts
What then could the defendant do? An appearance in the court
below, after that decisi6n, was all that remained to him; but as the appearance was an enforced one, there is no case which decides 'that he
cannot now claim the benefit of the privilege, if he was entitled to

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

it originally; and surely there is no principle which would produce
that effect. 'Harrison v. Rowan, 1 Pet. C. C. R. 489,is entirely up to
this point: and shows that-nothing but a voluntary appearance waives
the priv lege of a defendant,, not to be sued 'out of his own district.
There the court go further and say, that you may appear in order
to plead your privilege; but they are far from saying that you must
so take advantage of this right: and a careful consideration'of the
nature of a foreign attachment will show, that whatever might be the
case as to a suit in equity, a defendant ina foreign attachmentis not,
at all events, bound to plead the privilege in 'question; and it would
seem to be a necessary consequence, that after the failure of a summary application in the court below'to quash the writ forthis reason, that the application may be renewed in the Supreme Cou't;
since the ground of the application appears upon the record.
2dly. But is the defendant entitled to the privilege secured by the
section of the act in question; does this suit violate that privilege;
and does the record show both the privilege and the violation? -If
the defendant be an inhabitant of' the United States, he clearly has
the privilege.
1. Either the word "inhabitant" means any one who is liable to
the process of the United States' courts. Picquet v. Swan, 5 Mason,
55, R.. or,
2. It means an inhabitant'of one of the United States, i. e. a citizen
of one of, the United States.
Now the word in question must be defined in one of these modes,
for otherwise it would embrace cases over- which the United States'
courts have clearly no jurisdiction. Helpburn v. Ellzey, 2 'Cr. 445;
Corporation of New Orleans v. Winter, 1 Wheat. 91; Picquet v.
Swan,.5 Mason, 50, 54, 55; Rabaud v. D'Wolf, 1 Paine, 580.
The first definition is the more natural; for it seems obvious that
every case was intended to be provided for; and this construction
is .supported by high authority.
But if the first be incorrect, then the second definition must be
adopted; otherise, the phrase "inhabitant of the United' States,"
would embrace the ease of a citizen of the United States, not 'a citizen
of one of the United $Vtates: which, as we have seen, are not. within
the jurisdiction, of the federal courts. The literal meaning of the
words in question undoubtedly favour'this construction of them.
Either definition will, however, be fatal 'to the plaintiff's case;
the first will be clearly so; and I proceed to show that the second

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Toland v. Sprague,]

will be no less availing to the defendant. It has been repeatedly
decided, that where the j~risdiction of the courts of the United
States depencis upon the character of the parties to the suit, that character must appear upon therecord: and that averment is -one which
the plaintiff. must prove. Catlett v. Pacific Ins. Co. 1 Paine, 594;
Wood i-. Mann, 1 Sumner, 581. The character of the parties is here
the only foundation of jurisdiction; and the plaintifW averred that the
defendant was a citizen of Massachusetts. This appears in the precipe for the writ; in the writ; and in all the subsequent proceedings;
and the only foundation of the jurisdiction of the circuit court in this
case is, that the defendant was, at the time of the commencement of
this action, a citizen of Massachasetts. What is the meaning of the
word citizen in our jurisprudence? Citizenship, when spoken of in
the constitution, means nothing more than residence. Cooper's Lessee
v. Galbraith, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 546; Knox v. Greenleaf, 4 Dall. 360.
"A citizen who is domiciled in the enemy's country, as to his capacity to sue is deemed an alien enemy." Society, &c. v. Wheeler, 2
Gallis. 130.
The word "inhabitant," in the act, is obviously synonymous with
"citizen," 5 Mason 39. See, also, Prentiss v. Barton, 1 Brockenb.
389. "Inhabitant," is defined by philologists almost by the same
words as those employed by the federal court in their definitions.of
",citizenship," of a state. Crabb's Syn. verb, "to inhabit;" Johnson's
Diet.; Webster's Diet., words "inhabit,"! and "inhabitant.'?
The plaintiff, then, cannot.show that the defendant was not an inhabitant of Massachusetts, without contradicting the record; and this
he certainly cannot be permitted to do.
These principles only conduct us to the same result as the authorities, for it has been decided by two of the dircuit courts of the United
States, "that an action of foreign attachment will not lie in a circuit
,ourt against a citizen of the United States. Hollingsworth v. Adams,
2 Dall. 396; Picquet v. Swan, 5 Mason, 39.
Admitting, however, that the plaintiff is not estopped from. show'ing the defendant's, r'esideuce to be elsewhere than in Massachusetts3
what evidence did he bring tc the contrary? Now willanyone contend that a citizen of the United States loses his domicil by an absence abroad in the service of his country? If not, then the defendant's domicil, even according to the plaintiff's affidavit, is still in
'Massachusetts; and if reference is-made to the case of Lazarus v. Bar-

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

nett, 1 Dall. 153, it will be found, it is believed, that under these circumstances, had the defendant been domiciled in Pennsylvania before
he left the United States, the action could not have been maintained
against him in a court of the state of Pennsylvania. For residence
abroad is only prima facie evidence of domicil. ,Johnson v. Sundry
Articles. ofMerchandise, 6 Hall's Am. Law. Journ. 85.
But if the plaintiff can be supposed to have attained his object, and
to have shown by the evidence which he adduced for the purpose,
that the domicil of the defendant was in Gibraltar, at the time of the
institution of this suit; he eflectually deprives the courts of the United
States ofall jurisdiction over the case: since he would then be a
citizen of the United States but not a citizen of one of the United
States.
To conclude the argument on this point, the record shows that the
defendant was, at the time of the commencement of this action, a
citizen of Massachusetts; the laws which govern the action of foreign
attachment, and make it necessary that the defendant should be absent from the state, are judicially cognizable; and besides, the return
of the writ shows that the defendant was not served with the process
in the state of Pennsylvania. The defendant was forced, by the attachment of his funds, and the decision of the court on the summary
application, to appear to the action by entering special bail. The
error is therefore app,-rent to this Court, and the defendant has not
waived his privilege. Should the Court have any doubt about the
nature and grounds of the defendant's application to quash the attachme t; he should be permittld to showto this Court, that his appearan e was an involuntary one. This was the course pursued in
Harrison v. Rowan, 1 Peters' C. C. Rep. 489: but had the record
been fully certifiedl, there could have been no difficulty upon this
subject. If, on the other hand, the defondant was not an inhabitant
of Massachusetts, then he was a cltizen of the United States, but not
a citizen of one of the United States, and the circuit court never had
or can have jurisdiction of the cause.
There were two issues tried by the same jury, viz., one an issue
on the plea of non assumpsit; and the other CD-the plea of the statute
of limitations. Both were found for the defendant, " under the
direction of the court."
It is complained that there was error in the charge of the judge
upon the issue of the statute of limitations. If it should be granted,
for the sake of argument, that there was, yet how does this affect the

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

plaintiff? Even if a verdict had been found fo him, judgment must
have been given for the defendant, on the finding of the jury on the
other issue. There is no error suggested in the judge's directions to
the jury, under the general issue; for the siatute of limitations could
not have been given in evidence under the general issue, and any
charge of the court upon the effect of the statute, was, of course, inapplicable to that issue. The error, therefore, i1"
it w:ere material, has
become immaterial by the finding of the jury on the other issue.
No court reverses for immaterial errors. If this Court should reverse the judgment in this case, what-will they do With the verdict
on the general issue? Will they grant a venire de novo, as to that
also, when no error as to it is suggested? It is true, the jury have
added a clause to the verdict; from which it appears that they found
for the defendant, "under the direction of the court." But this is
no part of the verdict; it is mere surplusage; and it has no legal effect.
Nor does it appear that they allude to the supposed erroneous part
of the judge's charge.
The defendant, however, denies that there is any error in the
judge's charge. It has bcen urged, but it cannot be seriously contended, that the judge's charge was in itself erroneous. The only
point which can be really pressed is, that the charge was erroneous
in reference to the issue as to the statute of limitations actually under
trial; and it is said that the only point put in issue by the rejoinder
was, whether the plaintiff and defendant stood in the relation of
merchant and factor; and that the rejoinder admitted, that no account
had been settled by passing that allegation in the replication and
taking issue upon. the existence of the relation of. merchant and
factor.
Is this so? The plaintiff, in his replication, not only states that the
action was founded upon accounts between merchant and factor, but
also, that no account had been stated or settled between the parties;
and the whole of this matter was necessary to constitute a good reply to the defendant's plea. 5 Cranch, 15; 2 Cond. Rep. 175;
Spring v. Gray, 6 Peters, 151; Stiles v. Donaldson, 2 Dall. 264.. If,
then, that was a single proposition of defence, when we denied that
"those sums of money became payable in trade had between m'-rchant and merchant and factor, &c., in manner an(I 6Jrm, &c' as the
replication alleged, we denied the whole proposition of defence; and
the question whether'an account had been settled, immediately arose,
and was passed upon by the jury. If this was not the case, the issue
VOL. XII.-2 S

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

upon the statute of limitations was an immaterial one. if the de'fendant was the factor of the plaintiff,-then the account rendered to
Pettit is an account stated. Both admit the foot of that account to
be the amount in controversy.
Mr. Gilpin, for the plaintiff:
The facts involved are few, .and not disputed. In September,
1824, Henry Toland,"a citizen of Pennsylvania, shipped certain tobacco and teas, in the William Penn, bound to Gibraltar. They
were consigned to Pettit, the supercargo. Part were sold there by
him, and one thousand dollars of the proceeds remitted to Toland.
When Pettit left Gibraltar, in December, he placed the remainder
of these goods, with those of other persons, in the hands of- Horatio
Sprague, a citizen of Massachuse'ts, then; and still resident in Gibraltar; with instructions to sell them and account th-.refor to Toland.
He corresp6nded with. the latter accordingly, up to the following
June; when, on a settlement made between Pettit and Sprague, at
Gibraltar, of their own affairs, it appeared that the former was
largely indebted to the latter:, who, thereupon, passed the proceeds,
of the ggods, amounting to one thousand five hundred and seventynine dollars and, eleven cents, to Pettit's credit in their account, and
so wrote to Toland. No account was furnished to the latter; but in
the month of*September, 1825, he saw, in the possession of Pettit, a
general account of sales from Sprague, in which this item was embraced, and he thereupon demanded payment of it from Sprague.
This was refused; and though the commercial dealings and accounts
between them continued for several years, payment of this sum
never was obtained. In August, .1834, finding some property of
Sprague, in Pennsylvania, the plaintiff, Toland, commenced a suit,
by foreign attachment, in the circuit court of. the United States for
that district.
It is now objected that the court hhd no jurisdiction of such suit;
and this objection amounts to a denial of the right of proceeding in
the circuit courts of the United States, by "foreign attachment." If
this be so, it is scarcely possible that on a point which must have so
often arisen, we can be without an express judicial decision to that
effect: Yet none such has been produced. Two cases are relied on;
but neither of them turns upon 'this point, or resembles, in its circumstances, that now before the Court. In the case of Picquet v.
Swan, 5 Mason, 38, the defendant was described, hot as a citizen of

JANU.ARY TERM, 1838.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

a different state from the 'plaintiff, but as "a citizen of the-United
States:" a defect which Judge Story declared to be fatal. Again, the
service of the sumimons was clearly "'defective and nugatory." In
Ahe ease of Richmond v. Dreyfous, 1 'Sumner, 131, it appeared that
the defendant was a resident and injhabitant of another state, at the
time the suit was broughL; and of' course exempted by the express
provision of the judiciary act. But while no decisions can be produeed against this mode of proceeding, in a similar case; there are
several instances in which it has been adopted and allowed. Fisher
v. Consequa, 2 Wash. 382; Graighle v. Nottnagle, I Peters' C. C.
Rep. 255; Pollard v. Dwight, 4 Cranch, 421.,
The law would seem to be very clear. By the act of 29th September, 1789, sec. 2, a plaintiff in the circuit court is entitled to "all
such forms of writs and modes of process" as are "used or allowed
in each state respectively;" and it is not denied that this form of
writ, and mode of process, is used and allowed in Pennsylvania. We
admit that this law is controlled by the act of 24th September, 1789,
which describes the persons who 'may, and who my not be sued.
By that law, the suit must be "between a citizen of the state where
the suit is brought and a citizen of another state:" a fact which appears in this case in all the pleadings. There is a proviso, however,
that "no civil suit can be brought against an inhabitant of the United
States, in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant."
It is not aenied that if the defendant, Sprague, was an inhabitant of
any other state, this proceeding would not lie; but it is proved he is
not: it is admitted that he has long been an inhabitant of Gibraltar.
It is attempted to blend together citizenship and inhabitancy. The
act of congres did not mean this; it grants a personal privilege to
the inhabitants of every state, whether they be citizens or aliens: it
gives to every person actu ally resident in any state, the privilege of
being sued there, and exempts him from being dragged away to a distant tribunal: the defendant is no such resident, and consequently the
law did not 'mean to give him any such privilege.
But, even had he been entitled t:o that privilege when the suit was
brought, it is'now too late to avail himself of it. He has pleaded in
bar to the action, which is a waiver of his personal privilege. Had
he pleaded in abatement, the point would have come up for the judgment of the court. By neglecting.to do so, he has waived it. .Harrison v. Rowan, 1 Peters' C. C. R. 491 ; Pollard v. Dwight, 4 Cranch,
421; Logan v. Patrick, 5 Cranch, 288; Picquet v. Swan, 5 Mason,

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

43. The motion to quash was a summary proceeding, on which
error will not lie. If the defendant intended to avail himself of an
alleged error of the court in that decision, he should have then.permitted judgment to go by default; or have pleaded in abatement, so
that there might have been a judgment on the point. He has pleaded over to the action, and it is now too late to avail himself of the
error, if it were one.
But suppose it was error in the circuit court to refuse this privilege
even on a summary motion; still, by the record now before this
Court, it does not appear that they did so. The record merely sets
forth a general "motion to quash the attachment;" and, as general, a
"refusal" by the court: the grounds either of the one or the other
do not appear.
Passing, then, this preliminary point of the jurisdiction of the circuit court, we come to the charge of the court, in which the plaintiff
contends there is manifest error.
It is necessary to examine the pleadings carefully. This is an action of assumpsit. The defendant plead's first, non-assumpsit ; second,
the statute of limitations. The plaintiff joins issue on the first; and
replies to the second, that he is not barred by'the statute of limitations because "the sum claimed became due in trade between them
as merchants, and merchant and factory and that no account was ever
stated or settled between them."
The defendant rejoins only, that
"the sum' claimed did not become due in trade between them as merchants and merchant and factor."
The plaintiff joins issue. Here
then are two issues, both tendered by the defendant: and they are
first, non-assumpsit; second, were the dealings between the parties
those of merchants? No other points are left open by the pleadings.
The whole intention of pleading is to ascertain exactly the point in
controversy; the issue tendered is the notice of this point given by
one party to the other. Accordingly, on the trial, (as the receipt of
the money was admitted, and the assumpsit thus proved,) the whole
evidence and argument were confined to the point, Whether or not
"sthe dealings between the parties were those of merchants, and merchant and factor." When the court came to charge the jury, they exeluded, expressly, from their consideration all the evidence as to the
facts involved in this point, and all the arguments upon it: and they
instructed them that the case was to be decided upon another point;
namely, that where there was a settled and stated account for more
than six years, it barred the plaintiff's claim: that the account of 4th

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

JUly 1825, from Sprague to Pettit was such a one; and that the jury
must so find, as the question was one of law, not of fact. The vedice was so found accordingly, "under the. direction of the court."
To this charge, we have three exceptions:
I., The court charged orr the issue, "whether or not there wag a
settled and stated account between these parties;" and in so doing
they erred.
1. Because the parties themselves never made such anissue-in their
own pleadings. The plaintiff in his replication had expressly tendered that point to the defendant, but he had not accepted it.
2. Not only was that point not made by the pleadings, but it was
excluded by them; for if there was an account settled and stated, it
showed a balance due to the plaintiff for more than six years, yet the
defendant denies any such balance at any time, Again, it is excluded
because it was traversable matter presented, totidem verbls, in the
replication; and it is a settled rule of pleading, that "every material
fact alleged must be traversed;" Larned v. Bruce, 6 Mass. 57' and
that "where traversable matter is not traversed, it is confessed."
Nicholson v. Simpson, Strang9, 297. The allegation made by the
plaintiff in-his replication, that there was no account stated, not being
traversed, W'as thus confessed; and therefore excluded from thbe consideration of the jury, or the court.
3. Nor was the case either argued or tried upon this, point.
It was therefore error in the court to charge on it. They had no
right to put to the jury that which was, concluded- by the pleadings;
as well might the court on a plea of payment in an action of debt on
a bond, instruct the jury to find that it was, or was not the deed of
the defendant.
II. But suppose the question whether there was a settled account
be- not concluded by the pleadings; be still open to the jury; yet this
was a matter of fact. Various considerations are involved in it; it.
is not "a construction of written papers;" the-very plea and issue
show itwas for a jury: there was a complicated accouht between
Sprague and Pettit, a third person; the extent to which Toland,,the
plaintiff, was connected with each of them, was an essential element.
The court, in their charge, took entirely from the jury all fonsideration of these matters, and decided the point as entirely one of law.
In this there was error,

[Toland v. Sprague.]

prive the plaintiff of the benefit of that exception in *the statute of
limitations, which exists in favour of merchants. If we establish this,
as the court has charged there is such a stated and settled account,
We establish a manifest error.
According to the evidence in the case, the defendant, Sprague,
was the factor of Toland, the plaintiffs'and corresponded with him
as guch, from December, 1824, to-July, 18-15. He was also, during
the same period, engaged in trade with Pettit. In the latter month,
he made- up an account sales betweenhimself and Pettit, and sent
it,.not to the plaintiff, but to Pettit; in whose hands'the plaintiff saw
it, and found it embraced some of his property; and this he demanded of him. The dealings between the plaintiff ahd defendant con-tinued open for several years: 9prague always explicitly refused to
state or setle an account between himself and Toland, for any itpm
in the -account sales rendered to Pettit, and denied that the former
had any thing-to do with it. Yet on-these facts, it is contenoed that
there was a stated and'settled account between Toland and Sprague:
Lord Hard-wicke describes it. It is
What is a "stated account?"
an account current, sent by one merchant to another, in which a
balance is due from one to the- other. Tickel v. Shoirt,'2 Vesey,
239. If the receiver holds it for a certain time without objection,
it becomes a stated account. It must be an account, that is, a settlement of their transactions by the parties; it must be. between
themselves; it must-preclude both parties. But how is this account
between Pettit and Sprague a settlement between the latter and T6land? Would Sprague be precluded from any claim against Toland,
because he had omitted to state it in such an account with a third
-person ? It is no settlement, no statement of an account; and consequently no bar.
In addition to these exceptions to 'the charge-of the court, it remains to make a single remark on a point presented by thedefendant, as a reason why- the writ of error should be dismissed: that
"there were two pleaspleaded, the one being.the general issue, and
no averment in the record, that in this verdict and judgment on

the verdict, and that is expressly stated to be under the direction
of the court,. whose charge was confined to the question of the
statute of limitations. But in truth, this is not material; for it is
sufficient t, show manifest, error on any point in the charge of the
court.

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

Mr. Justice BAR13OUR delivered the opinion of the Court:
This ;s a writ of error to a judgment of the circuit court of the
United States for the district of Pennsylvania.
The suit was commenced by the llaintiff .in error against the defendant in error, by a process known in Pennsylvania -by the name
of a foreign attachmerkt; by which, according to the laws of that
state,, a debtor who is not an inhabitant of the commonwealth, is
liable to' be attached by his property found therein, to appear and
answer a suit'brought against him by a creditor.
It appears upon the record, that the plaintiff is a citizen of Pennsylvania; and the defendant a citizen of Massachusetts, but domiciled,
at the time .of the institution~of the suit, and for soibe years before,
without the limits of the United States, to wit, at Gibraltar; and
when the attachment was levied upon his property, not being found
within the district of Pennsylvania.
Upon the return of the attachment, executed on certain garnishees
holding property of, or being indebted to the defendant; he, by his
attorney, obtained a rule to show cause why the attachment should
not be quashed, which rule was afterwards discharged by the court;
after which the defendant appeared and pleaded. Issues were made
-up between the parties, on which they went to trial, when a Verdict
and judgment were rendered in favour of the defendant. At the
trial, a bill-of exceptions was taken by the plaintiff, stating the evidence at large, and the charge given by the court to the jury; which
will hereafter be particularly noticed when we come to consider the
merits of the case. But before we do so, there are some preliminary questions arising in the case, which it is proper -for us to dispose of.
And the first is, whether the process of foreign attachment can be
properly used by the circuit courts of the United States, in cases
where the defendant is Otomiciled abroad, and not found within ther
district in which the process issues, so that it can be served upon
him?
The answer to this question must be found in the construction of
the, 11th section of' the judiciary act of 1789, as influenced by the
true principles of interpretation; and by the course of legislation on
the subject.
That section,.as far as relates to this question, gives to the circuit
courts-original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of the several
states, of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, where,

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland -v. Sprague.]

the matter in dispute exceecrs, exclusive of costs, the sum Or value of
five hundred dollars, and an alien is a party; or the suit is between a
citizen of the state where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another
state. It then provides, that no person shall be arrested in one district for trial in ariother, in any civil action before a circuit or district
court; and moreover, that no civil suit shall be brought before either
of said courts against an inhabitant of the United States, by any
original process, in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found at the time of serving the
writ. A's it respects pers6ns ,who are inhabitants, oi who are found
in a particular district, the language is too explicit to admit of doubt.
The difficulty is,'in giving a construction to the section ii relation
to those who i re not inhabitantsand, not found in the district.
This question was elaborately argued by the circuit court of Massachusetts, in the case of Picquet v. Swan, reported in 5th Mason,35.
Referring to the reasoning in-that case, generally, as having great
force, we shall content ourselves with stating the substance of it in
a condensed form, in which we concur. Although the process acts
of 1789 and 1792 have adopted the forms of writs and modes of process in the several states, they can hive no effect where they contravene the legislation of congress. The state laws can confer no
authorit on this courti in the exercise of its jurisdiction, by the use
of state process, to reach either persons or property; which it could
not reach within the, meaning of the law creating it. The judiciary
act has divided the United States into judicial districts. Within
these districts, a circuit court is required to be holden. The circuit
court of each district sits within and for that district; and is bounded
by its local limits. Whatever may be the extent of their jurisdiction
over the subject matter of suits, in respect to persons and property;
it can only be exercised within the limits of the district. Congress
might have authorized, civil process from any circuit court, to have
run into any state of the.Union. It has not done so. It has not in
terms authorized any original civil process to run into any other
district; with the single exception of subpoenas for witnesses, within
a limited distance. In regard to final process there are two cases,
and tw9 only, in which writs of execution can now by law be served
in any other district than -that in which the judgment was rendered;
ode in favour of private persons, in another district of the same
state,; and the other in favour of the United States, in any part of

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Toland v. Sprague. ]

329

the United States. We'think that the opinion of the legislature is
thus manifested to be, that the process of a circuit court cannot be
served without the district in which it is established; without the
special authority of law therefor.
If such be the inference from the course of legislationi the same
interpretation is alike sustained by considerations of reason and justice. Nothing can be more unjust, than that'a person should have
his rights passed upon, and finally decided by a tribunal; without
Wime process being served upon him, by which he will have notice,
which will enable him to appear and defend himself. This principle
is strongly laid down in Buchanan v. -Rucker, 9 East, 192. Now,
it is not even contended that the circuit courts could proceed to
judgment against a person who was domiciled without the United
States, and not found within the judicial district, so as to be served
with process, where the party had no properly within'such district.
We would ask what difference there is, in reason, between the cases
in which he has, and has not such property? In the one case, as-in
the otfier, the court renders judgment against a person who hag no
notice of the proceeding. In the one case, as in the other, they itre
acting on, the rights of a person who is beyond the limits of their
jurisdiction, and upon whom they have no power to cause process
to be personally served. If there be such a difference, we are unable
to perceive it.
In examining the two restraining clauses of the eleventh section,
we find that the process of capias is in terims limited to the district
within which it is issued. Then follows the clause which declares
that no civil suit shall be brought before either of the said courts,
against an inhabitant of the United States, by any original process,
in any other district, than that whereof he is an -inhabitant,, or in
which he shall be, found at the time of serving the writ. We think
that the true construction of this clause is, that it did not mean to
distinguish between those who are inhabitants of, or found within
the district, and persons 'domiciled abroad; so as to protect the first,
and leave the others not within the protection: but that even in
regard to those who were within the United States, they should not
be liable to the process of the circuit courts, unless in one or the
other predicament stated in the clause: and that as to all those who
were not within the United States, it was not in the contemplation
of congress, that they would be at all subject, as defendants, to the
process of the circuit courts, which, by reason of their being in a
VoL.. XII-2 T

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

foreign jurisdiction, could not be served upon them; and therefore
there was no provision whatsoever made in relation to them.
If, indeed, it. be assumed that congress acted under the idea that
the process of the ircuit courts could reach persons in a foreign
jurisdiction, then the restrictions might be construed as operating
only in favour of the inhabitants of the United States, in contradistinction to those who were not inhabitants; but, upon the principle
which we have stated, that congress had not those in contemplation
at all, who'were in a foreign jurisdiction, it is easy to perceive why
the restriction in regard to the process was confined to inhabitants
of the United States. Plainly, because it would not have been
necessary or proper to apply the restriction to those whom the legisiaturek did 'not contemplate, as being within the reach of the process
of the courts, either with or without restrictions.
With these views, we have arrived at the same conclusions as the
circuit court'of Massachusetts, as announced in the following propositions, viz: Ist. That by the general provisions of the laws of
the United States, the circuit courts can issue no process beyond
the limits of their districts.- 2d. That independently of positive
legislation, the process can only be served upon persons within
the same districts.- 3d. That the acts of congress adopting the state
process, adopt the form and modes of service, only so far as the persons are rightfully within the reach df such process, and did not
intend to enlarga the sphe're, of the jurisdiction of the circuit courts.
4th. That the right to attach property, to compel the appearance of
persons, can properly be used only in cases in which such persons
are amenable to the process of the court, in personam; that is,
wherd
they are inhabitants, or found within the United States; and not
where they are aliens, or citizens resident abroad, at the commencement of the suit, and have no inhabitancy here: and we add, that
even in case of a person being amenable to process in personam, an
attachment against.his property cannot be issued against him ; except
as part of, or together with process to be served upon. his person.
The next inquiry is, whether the process of attachment having
issued improperly, th6re has any thing-been done which has cured
the error? And we think that there is enough apparent on the record, to produce that effect. It appears that the party appeared, and
pleaded to issue. Now, if the case were one of a want of jurisdiction in the court, it would not, according to well established principles, be competent for tle' parties. by any act of theirs,'to give. it.
But that isnot the case. The court had jurisdiction over the parties

JANUARY TERM. 1838.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

aind the matter in dispute; the objection was, that the party defendant, not being an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, nor found therein,
personal process could not reach him; and that the process of attachment could only be properly issued against a party under circumstances which subjected him to process in,
personam. -Now this was
a personal privilege or exemptioh, which it was competent for the
party to waive. The cases of Pollard v. Wright, 4 Cranch, 421
and Barry v. F'oyles, I Peters, 311; are decisive-to show, that'after
appearance and plea, the case stands as if the suit were brought in the
usual manner. And the first of these cases proves that exemption
from liability to process, and that in case of foreign attachment, too,
is a personal privilege, which may be waived; and that appearing and
pleading will producd that waiver.
It has, however-, been contended, that although this, is true as a
general proposition, yet the party cai avail himself of the object
t ion to the process in this'case, lbecause it appears from the record,.
that a rule was obtalqed by him to quash the attachment, which
rule was afterwards discharged; thus showing, that'the party sought
to avail himself, of the objection belpv, which the court refused.
In the first-place, it does not appear upon the record, what was
the ground of the rule; but if it did, we could not look into it
here, unless the party had placed the objection upon the record,
in a regular plea; upon which, had the court given judgment
against him, that judgment would have been examinable here.
But in the form in which it was presented in the court below, we
cannot act upon it in a court of error. The judiciary act authorizes
this Court to issue writs of error to bring uP a final judgment or decree in a civil action, or suit in equity, &c. The decision of the
court upon a rule, or motion, is not of that character'. This point,
which is clear upon the words of the law, has been often adjudged in
this Court; without going further, it will be'sufficient to refer to 6
Peters, 648; 9 Peters, 4. In the first of'these cases the question is
.elaborately argued by the Court, with a review of authorities;, and
they come to this conclusion that they consider all motions of this
port (that is) to quash 'executions, as addressed to the sound discretion of the Court; and as a summary relief, which the Court is not
compellable to allow. That the refusal to quash is not, in the sense
of the common law, a judgment; much less is it a final judgment.
It is a mere interlocutory order. Even at common law, error only
lies from a final judgment; and- by the express provisions of the ju-

SUPREME -COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.)

diciary act, a writ of error lies to, this Court only in cases offinal
judgments.
Having now gotten rid of these preliminary questions, we come,
in the order of, argument, to the merits of the case. To -understand
these, it will be necessary to look into the pleadings, the evidence,
and charge of the court, as embodied in the excelptions.
The declaration is in assumpsit,, and originally contained three
counts, viz., the first, a count charging the delivery of certain goods
to the defendant, upon a promise to account and pay over the proceeds, or sale thereof, by the defendant; and a breach of promise, in
not accounting, or paying the proceeds of the sale. 2dly. i. count
in indebitatus assumpsit; and 3dly, a count upon an account stated.
A rule having been grinted to amend the declaration, by striking
out this last count, and that rule having-been made absolute, we shall
consider the declaration as containing only the two first counts.
To this declaration the deferdant pleaded, the general issue, which
was joined by the plaintiff, and also the act of limitations; to this
-second plea, the plaintiff replied, relying on the exception in the
statute in favour of such accounts as concern the' trade of merchandise between merchant and merchant, their factors or' servants;
averring, that the money in the several promises in the declaration
became due and payable on trade had between the plaintiff and defendant, as merchant, and merchant andt factor, and wholly concerned the trade of merchandise between the plaintif as a merchant, and
the defendant as al merchant and factor of the plaintiff; -and averring, also, that' no account whatever of the said money, goods, and
merchandises, in the declaration nentioned, or any part thereof, was
ever stated, or settled between them. The defendant rejoined, that
he was not the factor of the plaintiff; and thaf the money in the se-.
veral promises in the declaration mentioned, did not become due and
payable in trade had between the plaintiff and defendant as merchant,
and merchant and factor; and on this, issue was joined. On the trial
of these issues, there were sundry letters between the parties, and
accounts given in evidence, which are set. forth at large in a bill of
exceptions, in relation to which the court gave a charge to the jury;
the jury having found a verdict for the defendant, and the court having rendered a judgment in his favour, the casd is brought by the
plaintiffs, into this Court, by Writ of error, And the question is,
whether there is any error in the charge of the court, as applie4 to
the facts of the case stated in the exception. The court, after going

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Toland v. Sprague.]
at large into the facts of the case, and the principles of law -applying
to it, concluded with this instruction to the jury: That there was no
evidence in the cause, which could justify them in finding that the
account in evidence, was such a mutual, open one, as could. bring the
case within the exception of the act of limitations.
In deciding upon the correctness of this instruction, it is necessary to inquire what is the principle of law by which to test the
question, whether a case does or does not come within the exception
of the statute, in favour of accounts between merchant and merchant;
their factors or servants. No principle is' better settled, than, that
to bring a case within the exception, it must be an account; and that,
an account open, or current. See 2d Wins, Saund. 127, d. e., note 7.
In 2 Johns. 200, the Court say that the exception must be confined
to actions on open or current accounts; that it mnustbe a direct concern of trade; that liquidated demands, or bills and notes which are
.only traced up to the trade or merchandise, are too remote to come
within this description.' But the case of Spring and others v. The
Ex'rs. of Gray, in this Court: 6 Peters, 151; takes so full and ancurate a review of the doctrine and cases, as to render it unnecessary
to-refer to other authorities. It distinctly asserts the principle, that
the account, to come within the exception,. must be open or current.
This construction, so, well settled on authority, grows out of the very
purpose for which the exception was enacted. That pprpose was to
Igrevent the injustice and injury which would result to merchants
having trade with each other, or dealing with factors, and living at a
distance, if the act of limitations were to run, where their accounts
were open and unsettled; where, therefore, the balance was unascertained, and-where, too, the state of tile accounts -mightbe constantly
fltiduating, by continuing dealings between the parties.
But when the account is stated between the parties, or when any
thing shall have been done by them, which, by their implied admission, is equivalent to a settlement, it has then become an ascertained
debt. In the language of the court of appeals of Virginia, 4 Leigh,
249, "all intricacy of.account, or doubt as to which side the balance
may fall, is at an end ;" and thus the case is neither within the letter
nor the spirit of the exception. In short, when there is a settled
'account, .that becomes the cause of action, and not the original account, alth-ough it grew .out of an account between merchant and
merchant, their factors or servants.
Let us now inquire how far this principle, applies to the facts of.

SUPREME COURT.
[T1and v. Sprague.]

this case. It appears by the bill of exceptions, that the facts are
these:
In the year 1824, the plaintiff consigned a quantity of merchiandise, by the ship William Penn, bound for Gibraltar, to a certain
Charles Pettit, accompanied with instructions as to the disposition of
it. Pettit, after 'arriving at Gibraltar, and remaining there a short
time, placed all the merchandise belonging to the plaintiff, which remained unsold, in the hands of the defendant, to be disposed of by
him, for plaintiff's account. The plaintiff produced on the trial, an
account of the sales of the aforesaid me'ichandise, dated June 30th,
1825, signed by the defendant, as having been made by him, amounting in nett proceeds to two thousand five hundred and seventy-nine
dollars and thirteen cents; and showing that balance.
In September, 1825, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant, requesting him to remit to him the nett proceeds of this merchandise,
amouriting to two thousand five hundred and seventy-nine dollars
and thirteen cents; after deducting therefrom a bill of exchange of
one thousand dollars, which had be en drawn by defendant in favour
of Charles Pettit, on a hoiuse in New York. Pettit being indebted to
the defendant, as alleged by. him, in a large sum of money, for advances, and otherwise, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the
amount of the sales of- the merchandise; and denied h'is liability to
account to him therefor.
In addition to the demand before stated, by plaintiff on the defendant, for the balance of the account of sales by letter, on the trial
of the cause, the counsel for the plaintiff, in opening the ease, claimed the balance ofan account between Sprague, the defendant, and
Charles Pettit; being the precise amount of the *balance of the account of sales, after deducting the bill of exchange for one thousand
dollars.
It appears that the plaintiff wag in possession of the account of
sales as early as September, 1825.
Upon this state of facts appearing in the record, the question is,
whether the cause of action in this case is an open, or current account between the plaintiff and defendant, as merchant and factor,
concerning merchandise; or whether it is an ascertained balAnce, a
liquidated 'sum, which, although it grew out of a trade of merchandise, is, in legal effect, under the circumstances, a stated account?
We think it is the latter.
In the language of the court who gave the charge, we think that

JANUARY TERM, isms.
tTolend v. Sprague.1

"the claim is for a precise balance, which was demanded by the plaintiff
from the defendant in 1825." From the nature of the accoufit,
and the conduct'of the parties, there was from the time the account
of sales was received by the plaintif showing the balance, and demanded by the plaintiff of the defendant, no unsettled open account
between them as merchant and merchant, or merchant and factor.
We agree in opinion with the circuit court that there was a matter of
controversy brought to a single point between them; that is, which
of them had, by law, a right to a sum-of money, ascertained by consent to amount to one thousand five hundred and seventy-nine dollars. That the nature of the account is not changed by there being
a controversy as to a balance stated, which the defendant does not
ask to diminish, or the plaintiff to increase; and as neither party
asks to open the account, and both admit the same balance, there can
be no pretence for .saying that it is still open. As the circuit court
say, the question between them is not about the, account, or any
item in it; but as to the right of the defendant to retain the admitted
balance, to repay the advances made to Pettit. We agree with the
court, that the mere rendering an account does not make it a stated
one; but that if the other party receives the account, admits the correctness of the items, claims the balance, or offers to pay it, as it may
be in his favour or against him; then it becomes a st-Led account.
Nor do we think it at all important that the account was not made
out as between the plaintiff and defendant; the plaintiff having received it, having made no complaint as to the items or the balance,
but on the contrary having claimed that balance, thereby adopted it;
and by his own act treated it as a stated account. We think, thereforei that the act of limitations began to run from-the year 1825, when
that demand was made; and consequently that the instruction of the
court was correct in saying that it was not within the exception.
It has however been argued, that whatever mlight be the conclusion
of the court, as resulting from the evidence, that the defendant had
admitted upon the, record that the account was an open one. It is said,
that the plaintiff having averred in his replication that there was no
account stated, or settled between him and the defendant, and the defendant not 'having traversed that averment in his 'rejoinder, the
matter contained in that averment is admitted. It is a rule ip'pleading, that where in the pleading of one party there is a material averment, which is traversable, but .which is not traversed by the other
party, it is admitted. We think that the rule does'not apply to this

SUPREME COURT.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

case, because the negative averment in the replication that, no account
had been stated between the parties, was not a necessary part of the
plaintiff's replication, to 'bring him within the exception of the statute
in relation to merchants' accounts. Inasmuch, then, as the replication
Vvithout'that averment would be sufficient; we do not consider it as
one of those material averments, the omission to traverse which is
an admission of its truth, within the rule before stated.
But in another aspect of this case the statute of limitations would
apply to, agnd bar the plaintiff's claim; if the account of sales were
regarded as having no operation in the case. The plaintiff, standing
in the relation which he did to the defendafit, as it respects this merchandise, had a-right to call upon him to account; he did make that
demand, and the defendant refused to render one, holding himself
liable to account to Pettit only. From the moment of that demand
and refusal, the statute of limitations began to run. See 1 Taunton,
572.
It was argued that the question whether there was a stated account
or not; was a question of fact for the jury; and that therefore the
court erred-in taking that question from them, and telling them that
this was a stated account.
The answer is, that there was no dispute about-the facts; and that
the plaintiff claimed the balance of the account as being the precise
sum due to him. it was therefore competent tQithe court to instruct
the jury that it was a stated account.
Upon the whole, we think there is no error inthe judgment: it is
therefore affirmed, with costs.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY:
I concur with the majority of the Court in affirming the judgment
of the eircuit court. But I do not assent to that part of the opinion
which declares that. the circuit courts of the United States have not
the power to issue'the processof attachment against the property of
a debtor, who is not an inhabitant of the, jJnited States. It does not
appear by the record that this point was raised- in the court below;
and I understand from the learned judge who presided at the trial,
that it was not made.
The decisions on this question have not been uniform at the circuits. In several districts where this process had been authorized by
the laws of the states, the circuit courts of the United States atopted
it in practice;. and appeared to have considered the aiA of congress of

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Toland v. Sprague.]

1789, as, having authorized its adoption. The different opinions entertained in different circuits, show that upon this point the-construction of the act of 1789 is not free from difficulty; and as the legality
of this process has been recognised in some-of the circuits for many
years, it is probable that condemnations and sales have taken place
under such attachments, and that property is now held by bona fide
purchasers who bought, and paid their money, in the-confidence naturally inspired by the judgment of the court.
If the case before us required the decision of this question, it would
be our duty to meet it and decide it. But the point is not necessarily
involved in the decision of this case; and I am, therefore, unwilling
to express an opinion: upon it.
The attachment, in the case before us was dissolved by the appearance of the defendant; and no final judgment was given upon it in
the court below. When the defendant appeared and pled in bar to
the declaration filed by the plaintiff, the controversy became an ordinary suit between plaintiff and defendant; the proceedings on the attachment were at an end, and could in no degree influence the future
progress and decision of the action. And this Court, in revising the
judgment given by the circuit court in such an action, cannot look
back to the proceedings in the attachbient in which no judgment
was given; nor can the 'refusal of the circuit court to quash the attachment on the motion made by the defendant, be assigned as error
in this Court. The validity of that process, therefore, need not be
drawn into question in the judgment of this Court, on the case presented here for decision. For whether the attachment was legal or
illegal, the judgment of the circuit court as the case comes before us,
must be affirmed. And as the question is an important one, and may
affect the rights of individuals who are not before the Court, and as
the case under considiration does not require us to decide it; I think
it advisable to abstain from expressing an opinion upon it: and do
not assent to that part df the opinion of the Court which declares
that the process in question is not authorized by'the acts of congress.
Mr. Justice BALDWIN agreed with the Chief Justice in the opinion
delivered by him; if it was necessary, he would go further as to the
authority of the courts of the IUnited States to issue foreign attachments.
Mr. Justice WAYNE agreed with the Chief Justice in opinion.

[Toland v. Sprague.]

thought the circuit courts of the United States had authority to'issue
foreign attachments. The decision- on that point, is not necessary to
the decision of this case.

.Mr. Justice CATRON had not formed any opinion on the question of
the right of the circuit courts to issue foreign attachments. He
thought that question did not come :before 'the Court in this case;
and it was not necessary to examine or decide it.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from
the circuit court of the United States for the eastern districtof Pennsylvania, and was argued by counsel. On consideration vWere6fi it is
now here ordered and adjudged by this Court, that the judgment of
the said circuit court in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed,
with costs.
