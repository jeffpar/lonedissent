FRANCIS WEST AND OTHERS, APPELLANTS V.'WALTER BRASHEAR.
A defendant in an appeal, using the copy of the record received frQn.the circuit court
lodged by the appellant, cannot have the appeal docketed and dismissed, under-the
3Qth rule of the court; on the ground that the appellant has failed to comply with
the 37th rule, which requires a bond to be given to the clerk of the Su-preme Court,
before the case is docketed. He must, ,tS*sustain a Tnotion to dismiss the cause,
produce the certificate of the circuit court stating the cause; and certifying that
such an appeal has been duly sued out and allowed.

APPEAL from the circuit court for the district of Kentucky.
On a motion of Mr. 'Crittenden, counsel for the defendant, to dismiss the appeal.
Mr. Chief Justice T.ANEY delivered 'the opinion of the Court.
In this case an appeal has beet' taken from the decree of the circuit court for the eighth circuit, and a copy of the record in due
formv has been lodged by the appellants with the clerk. But the
case has not'been docketed, because the appellants have not filed the
bond to secure the fees to the clerk Of this Court, prescribed by the
rule No. 37, adopted at January term, 1831..
Upon the record brought here as abovementioned, the appellee
has moved the Court for leave to d6cket and dismiss the case, under
the 30th rule. We think this cannot be done. The appellee, upon
producing 'the certificate from the clerk of the circuit court, as required 'by the 30thrule of 'this Court, stating the cause and certifying that such an appeal had been duly sued out and allowed, will be
entitled to have the 6ase docketed and dismissed. But this cannot
-be done .on the record brought here by the appellants.
The motion is therefore overruled.
