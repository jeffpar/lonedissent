SUPREME COURT.

THE UNITED STATES V. ZEPHANIAH KINGSLEY.
A grant for land in Florida by Governor Coppinger, on condition that the grantee
build a mill within a period fixed in the grant, declared to be void; the grantee not
having performed the condition, or shown sufficient cause for, its non-performance.
Under the Florida. treaty, grants of land made before the 24th January, 1818, by his
catholic majesty, or by' his lawful authorities, stand ratified and confirmed to the
same extent that the same grants would be valid if Florida had remained under
the dominion of Spain; and the owners of conditional grants, who have been prevented from fulfilling all the conditions of their grants, have time by the treaty
extended to them 'to complete such conditions. That time, as Was declared by
this Court in Arredondo's case, '6 Peters, 748, began to run in regard to individual
rights from the ratification of the treaty; and the treaty declares, if the conditions
are not complied with, within the.terms limited in the grant, that the grants shall be
null and void.
In the construction of the Florida treaty, it is admitted that the United States succeeds to all those equitable obligations which we are to suppose would have influenced his catholic majesty' to secure their property to his subjects, and which
would have been applied by him in the construction'of a conditional grant, to
make it absolute; and further, that the United States must maintain the rights of
property under it, by applyifig the laws and customs by which those rights were
secured, before Florida was ceded; or by which an inchoate right of property
would, by those laws and customs, have been'adjudicated by the Spanish authority to have become a perfect right.
The capes decided by the Court relative to grants of land in Florida, reviewed and
affirmed.

ON appeal from the superior court of East Florida.
In the district court of East Florida, in April, 1829, Zephaniah
Kingsley presented a petition, claiming title to a tract of land'situated on a creek emptying into the river St., John; which, he asserted
was granted to him by Governor Coppinger, on the 20th of November, 1816, while East Florida was held by the crown of Spain.
The petition stated,.that in virtue of the grant, the petitioner had,
soon after its date, entered and taken possession of the land, and was
preparing to build a water saw-mill thereon, according to the condition of the grant; but was deterred therefrom by the disturbed state
of that part of the province of East Florida, and the occupancy of the
'land by some of the tribes 9f Florida Indians, who were wandering
in all directions over the country.

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[United States v. Kingsley.]

The grant-referred to in the petition, was in the following terms:
"Considering the advantage and u~tility which is to accrue to the
province, if that is effected which Don Zephaniah Kingsley proposes
to do, it is hereby granted to him, that, without prejudice of a third
party, he may build a water saw-mill in that creek, of the river St.
John called M'Girt's;' under the precise condition, however, that
until he builds said mill, this grant will be considered null and
void; and when the event takes place, then, in order that he may
not suffer by the expensive preparations he is making, he will have
the faculty of using the pines comprehended within the square of
five miles, which he solicits for the supply of said saw-mill; and no
other person will have a right to take any thing from it. Let the
corresponding certificate be issued to him from the secrctary's office.
"COPPINGER."
The district attorney of the United States, for East Florida, filed,
at May term, 1829, an answer to the petition of Zephaniah Kingsley,
requiring from the court that due proof should be made by the
petitioner, of the matters'set forth in the petition; and also that the
grantee had prepared to build a water saw-mill on the land, as
stated in the grant.
The answer also asserts, that the grant was made on the express
condition, that, until the grantee built the mill, the grant was to be
considered as null and void; and that he had wholly and entirely
failed to build the mill, and still fails to build the same.
O~n the 6th July, 1833, an amended petition was filed, setting forth;
that, upon the state and condition of the province of East Florida,
east of the St. John's, being made known by the grantees of mill
grants, and of the impossibility of complying with the conditions of
the grants; governor Coppihger, by a verbal order or decree, made
known that in consequence of the continued unsettled and disturbed
state of the province, and of the impossibility of the grantees of mill
grants complying with the conditions of the same with safety to
themselves or their property, that the grantees should not, by a
failure to erect their mills, thereby forfeit their title.; but that the
same should remain valid, and be exonerated from the compliance
of the condition therein named, till the state of the country should
be such as that the grantees could, with safety, erect their works.
The amended petition alleged, that the country was in a disturbed and dangerous state, from the date of the petitioner's grant,
and for a long time previous, till the transfer of the province from

SUPREME COURT.
[United States v. Kingsley.]

Spain to the United States; and that your petitioner could not, with
any safety to himself or his property, have erected said mill west of
the St. John's, between the time of the date of his grant, and the
transfer, of the province as aforesaid.
To this amended petition the district attorney answered, and called
for proofs of the allegatiolis therein; and he also submitted to the
courty thatif the part of the province in which the land said to have
been granted, had continued in a disturbed situation from indian
hostilities, it had been in that situation when the grant was made;
and that this should not be an excuse for the non-compliance with the
conditions of the grant. The answer alleged, that from 1821, part
of the province has been entirely tranquil, but no attempt toerect
the mill has been made.
At July tNrm, 183,,a second amendment to the petition was filed,
stating that soon after th6 issuing of the grant, the petitioner entered
and took possession of a tract of the land surveyed to him under the
grant, and actually began to build a mill upon it; but was deterred,
by the dangerous situation of the country, from completing the same.
The answer of the district attorhey denied the allegations in this petition, _and called for proofs of,the same. No evidence waÂ§ given to
sustain the statement in the second amended petition. The assertion,
that the uncertainty as to titles to the lands in the province since
the transfer by Spain, is denied to be an excuse for the laches or
negligence of the grantee.
After 'the production of written evidence, and the examination of
witnesseA, the district court gave a decree in favour of the petitioner;
confirming to hir the quantity of land mentioned in the grant.
From this decree, the United States prosecuted an appeal to this
Court.
The case was argued by ,Mr. Butler, attorney general for the
United States. No counsel appeared for the appellee.
Mr. Bufler contended that the grant to the appellee was on condition, and the condition had not been complied with. The language
of the grant is explicit; and no- title to the land could be derived
under it, until the terms were complied with': " Until ie builds said
mill, this grant will be considered null and void; and when that event
iakes place, 'then in order that he may not suffer by the expensive
prejiarations he is making. he will have the faculty of uaing the

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

.479

[Unite4 States v. Kimgs!y.]

pines c6mprehended within the square of five miles, which -he-soiCits for the supply. of said saw-mill."
It is admitted, that according to the decrees of this Court, giving
the timber on the land, gives-the land; but in this case, the objection
to this confirmation of the appellee's grant, rests on other grounds.
No attempt to comply with the condition of the grant was made.
It has been decided by this Court, that although such grants -were on
conditions precedent, yet, if a party has commenced making the improvement, and is prevented by circumstances beyond, his control
from completing it, the grant, under an equitable view of it, will not
be defeated.
The strongbst case in favour of a grantee, is the case of Sibbald,
10 Peters, 313. In that case efforts were made to build the mill,
and they were defeated. 'But in the case before the Court no such
efforts were made. The condition is, that within six months the mill
shall be built; and the consideration for this grant is the advantage
and utility which will accrue to the province from the improvement.
The allegation thatthe disturbed situation of the province would not
permit the improvement, is of no value; when taken in connection
with the circumstance, that when this' grant was asked for, the province was in that situation. No proof is in the case ofany attempt;
and the second amended petition, in which this is asserted, is altogether unsupported by evidence. The allegation was not made until
the decisions of this Court, making an attempt to comply with a condition-in a-grant sufficient to make such grant valid.
But there is another view of this case,'upon which the claim of
the petitioner to 'a confirmation of the grant should be refused.
.Governor Coppinger, by a written order, declared that within six
months the condition in 'all 'grants should be complied-with. White's
Compilation of the Spanish Land Laws, 250, The'six months allowed by the order, expired long before the Florida treaty of cession.
Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court:
This is an appeal by the United States from a decree of the superior
court of the eastern district of Florida, confirming a land claim.
It appears that Zephaniah Kingsley, on the 20th of November,

18116, being then an inhabitant of the province of Florida, petitioned
Go'Vernor Coppinger, stating, "that wishing to erect a water sawmill in that creek of the river' St. Johnj called M'Girt's, on a vacant
place, and it being necessary for that purpose to have a quantity of

[Uitqd States v. Kingsley.]

your excellency to, be pleased to favour , him with your superior
p rmission to build the same on the place aforesaid, with its area of
five miles square of land as the equivalent thereof,, for its continued
supply of timber: bounded soUth-east and south by lands grinted to
Ferguson and Doctor Lake; south-west and west by vacant lands;
north by Don JuaR M'Intosh's land, and east'by 4ads of said Kingsley, and the river-St. John."
Upon this petition.the governor made the following decree-:
'Considering the advantage and utility which is to accrueto ihe
province, if that is effected which Don Zephaniah Kingsley proposes
to, do, it is hereby granted to him, that without prejudice of a third
party, he may build a water-mill on that creek of the river St. John,
called M'Girt's; under the precise, condition however, that until he
builds said nill, this grant will be considered null -and void: and
when the event takes place', then,,in order that.he may not suffer bythe expensive preparations he is making, he will have the faculty
of using the pines comprehended within the square of five 'miles,
which he solicits for the supply of said saw-mill; and no other person will have a right to take an- thing from it. Let the corresponidnding certificate be issued to hiM from the secretary's office.
"St Augustine,, 2d Dec. 1816."
"COPPINGER.
Upon this decree, the petitioner states, that soon afte r'the date, of
it, he entered upon and took possession of the land granted in the
situation mentioned -insaid grant, and was preparing to build a water
saw-mill, agreeably to'the.cand'tion of the grantq but was deterred
therefrom by,the disturbed state of that part of the province of East.
Florida, and the occupancy of the land by some of the tribes of
Florida Indians, who were 'then wandering in all directions over the,
courtry. 'The appellee then insists that his right to the land is embraced by the treaty betw een Spain, and the United States; -gives a
narrative of his' submission qf his clainm to the hoard of commissioners, under the act of, congress, entitled "an -act amending-and
-supplementary to an act for ascertaining claims and' titles to land, in
the territory of Florida, and to provide for the survey-and disposal of
the public lands in Florida," passed 3d March, 1823; that the commissioners reported unfavourably upon it, which. he insists was contrary to the law and evidence produced in the cause: and further,
that the report of the conimissioners upon his claim was not final, as
the tract of land claimed by him, contains a largerquantity than the

JANUARY, TERM, 188.
[United States v. Kingsley.]commissioners were authorized to decide tipon by any of the acts of
congress.
The petition of the appellee, of which an abstract has been just
given, was filed on the 21stApril, 1829. , In" the follbwing month,
the United States, by the United States' attorney, filed an answer to
this petition, denying, for sundry causes and, reasons, the entire, existence and equity of the appellee's claim: ind in August of the elisuing year, the United States' attorney amended. his answer, referring
to certain orders of' governor Coppinger, dated the 27th October,
1818, and on the 19th January, 1819: the, first of which limits the
time to six months from the 27th October, 1818, within which all
grants and concessions of land Which had been made on,condition
for mechanical works, to wit, factories, saw-millsj &c., were to re,
vert to -the class of public lands, and to be declared vacant; unless
the grantees, or concessioners, should comply with the conditions of
such grants or concessions; and the second of which. declares all
such conditional grants or concessioi.s null and of no effect, in those
cases where th persons 'in,, whose' favour they were mader had remained inactive, having done nothing to advance the establishment-of
those works. See White's Cpntpilation, 250, 25S, 256; 257, for
these orders.
The United States' attorney alleges -the appellee to be one of those
persons whose supposed concession was null and void under the first
order; and that itwas entirely annulled and set aside by the last, as
he had not then, nor had npt since established or advanced, inany
manner, the building of his mill, but had wholly failerd and neglebted
to do so. To this answer, the appellee put inaa general replication;
and the cause came, by regular continuance, to the term of the court
in Novejnber, 1832, when permission. was given to the appellee to
amend his petition.. In July, 1843, he filed the amendment, stating
that the disturbe, and da_ gerous condition of the province west of
the St. Johins river, which continued'frcm 1812 to the exchange of
flags, had induced Governor Coppipgev to declare, by a verbal
order, and decree, that the unsettled.and disturbed state of the province, and' the impossibility of the grantees of mill-grants to comply
with the :conditions of the same, with safety to themselves and their
.property,. that th grantees should hot, by a failure to erect their
mills, forfeit their' titles.

-dition of such grants, by any verbal oider an4 decree, the appellee
gave no proof on the trial of this cause.
In the amendment of the appellee's petition, the United States'
counsel replies, denying the-existence of any such verbal order and
decree by Governor Coppinger; and otating, that if there was any
such danger from the disturbed condition of the province, as the
appellee had alleged, that it existed as well at the time when he
applied for the grant, and when he accepted the same, as at any time
afterwards. In this. state of the pleadings, the cause was brought to
trial, -as well upon the evidence on the part of the United States, as
upon the part of. the appellee,; but was -not then decided, At the
July term of 18.35, the appellee filed, by permission of the court,
another amendment to his petition, in which, after reciting the surveys made under the decrees ot the governor upon his petition, he
further says, that soon after the, grant was made to him,,he took possession of the land,:and actually began to build a water saw-mill on
M'Girt's creek, pursuant to the condition of the grant; but that he
was deterred and prevented from completing the same by the disturbed and dangerous state of the country, which continued until the
cession of Florida by Spain to the United States. And after that
cession, he states he Was deterred' from proceeding, to the further
performance of the conditions of said grant, by the great uncertainty
in which his right and title to said land Was involved by-said cession.
To this amendment of the petition the United States' attorney replied,
repeating the facts and objections to the claim of the appellee made
in his previous answers; and further insisting that tne surveys, upon
which the appellee relied, were made after the 24th of January,
1818, and- nre not agreeable to the calls of the said supposed grant:
and that they are null and void by the provision of the latter clause
of the 8th article of the treaty between Spain and the United States,
of the 22d February, 1819.
Upon these pleadings and the evidence, the' court has decreed the
appellee s claim to be Valid; thai it isin accordance with .the laws
and customs of Spain; and under and by virtue of the late treaty
with Spain; and under and by virtue of the laws of nations, and of
the United States.
We think differently r pm .the, court upon all the grounds 'stated
in the decree. They open a Wide subject of remark; but-we abstain from discussing any qf them, except the application. of the
treaty to this claim, or of the laws and customs of Spain. These
points we shall ouch very briefly. We first, observe, that .no

case of a land claim

.nFlorida, confirmed by this Court under the

treaty, either in terms, or by necessary inference from what the
Court has said, covers this case. We view this claim under the decree of Governor Coppinger, as a permission to enter upon the land
designated in the petition and decree, in which land the appellee
did not and could not acquire property, or even inchoate title;osuch
as embraced in the 8th article'of the treaty, or by this Court's construction of it, until he had, in good faith, prepared to execute the
condition which the appellee held out as the inducement to obtain a
grant: or in Other words, we think the decree of. the governor contails a condition precedent, to be performed by the appellee befoi'e
the grant could take effect. In this case the appellee never attempted
to perform the condition: there is no proof of his having done so in
good faith, by the expenditure of money or application of labour. On
the contrary, there are, in the original petition of the appellee to the
court bolow, and in all the subsequent. amendments of -it,from 1829
to 1833, his declarations that-he had not done so, until the amendment made in 1835; when he states, for the first time, that he actually began to build a water saw-mill, according to the conditions of
the grant a short time after it was:-made, but that he was prevented
from completing it by the disturbed and dangerous condition of the
country.
The only proof given by him 'of his having actually began to
build, is very equivocal, and should have been rejected by the court,
on the ground of its being hearsay; except so much of it as relates
to the remains of some work or mill-dam, which of 'itself could not
be evidence, until, by other proof, the appellee had established the
fact of such w6tk having been done by himself, as the witness testifying, says expressly that it was only from hearsay that he had said
that work was done by the appellee. The witness says, he does not
know of his own knowledge that the appellee ever made any attemptor preparations for building a saw-mill on said mill seat tract,
but that he had seen timber on the said tract;' was told it was got by
Kingsley for the purpose of building a saw-mill; that he afterwards
saw a dam had been erected on each side of the stream, in the bottom of the stream saw timbers laid, as witness supposed, for the sills
'of a- saw-mill; that he only knows from hearsay, that said preparations were made by Kingsley; that a part of the preparations are
still remainil)g, and to be seen on said tract; that he first saw the timber abovementioned, in the year 1817 or 181,8, and shortly after saw

SUPREME COURT.
[United States v. Kingsley.]

the dam and sills aforesaid; that thesad timber was mostly destroyed
by fire. And by the record we are left to conclude that these works
were made by Kingsley, without any, even probable proof that he
had at any time taken possession of'the land. We cannot do so;
and- if we could, it would be deemed by us no compliance with the
condition contained in the governor's devree or concession in his
favour, as the' Work Was discontinued for an insufficient cause,,that
was, the disturbed anddangerous condition of the country. All the
witnesses concur in stating there was' no more danger after the appelle6 petitioned for the land, than there hat been before and at tho
time of his application. The appellee .then cannot be perthitted to
urge as an,excuse, in fact or in law, for. not complying with his undertaking, a dangerwhich applies as forcibly to repudiate the sincerity of his intention.to build a mill when .hepetitiqned for land for
that purpose, as it does to his inability from stidh. dapger to execute it afterwards. Un'der the treaty, it is true that grants of land
made before the 24th January, 1818j by his "catholic majesty, or by
his lawful authorities, stand ratified and confirmed, to the same extent that the same grants.would be valid, if Florida. had remained
under the dominion of Spain; and the owners of conditional grants,
who have been prevented, by the circumstances 'of the Spanish
nation, from fulfilling all the conditions of their grarats, have time by
the treaty, extended to them to complete such 'conditions. That
time, it was determined by this Court, in Arredondo's oase, 6 Peters)
748, 749i began to run, in regard to individual rights, from the ratification of the treaty; and the treaty declares, if the conditions are not
complied with within the terms limited in the grants, that the grants
shall be null and void. It is admitted, that in the construction of
this afticle of the treaty the United States succeeds to all tfiose
equitable obligations which we Are to suppose would have influenced
his catholic majesty to secure to his subjects their property; and
which would have been applied by him in the construction of a
conditional grant to make it absolute. And further, in the construction of this article of the treaty, it must be conceded that the United
States must maintain the rights of pr9perty under it, by applying
the laws and customs by which those rights were secured before
Florida was ceded or by which an inchoate right of property would,
by laws and customs, have been adjudicated by Spanish authority, to.
have become a perfect right; by applying, in the first instance, in
such cases, as was said in Arredondo's case, the principles of justice

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[United States v. Kingsley.]
according to the rules of equity; and in the second, all those laws
and customs decisive of a right of property, whilst the party claiming the right was a subject of Spain. Test then the case before us
by the most liberal' equity, and it will appear that the claimn of the
appellee cannot be sustained by any effort by him to perform the condition of the governor's grant; either before the ratification of the.
treaty, or since. indeed. in the last amendment of his petition, in
1835, he states he was prevented from proceeding to the further
performance of the condition of said grant, by the great uncertainty
in which his tight and title to the land was involved by the cession.
These Florida grants, or concessions of land upon condition, have
been repeatedly confir, ed by this Court; and it will apply the principles of its adjudications to all cases of 'a like kind. It will, as it
has done, liberally construe a performance of conditions precedent
or subsequent, in such grants. It has not, nor will it apply in the
construction of such conditions in such cases, the rules of the' common law. But this Court cannot say a condition wholly unperformed, without strong proof of sulicient cause to prevent it, does not
defeat all right of property in land, under such a decree as the appellee in this case makes the foundation of his claim.
Arredondo's grant, confirmed by this Court, 6 Peters,.was a clear
case of a grant in fee for past services and commendable loyalty to
his sovereign, with a condition subsequent, of a nature the perforniance of which must have been a matter of indifference as well to
the king of Spain as to the United States, after a cession of Florida
was made. The condition was, that the grantees should establish on.
the land two hundred Spanish families, and that they were to begin
to carry into effect the establishment within three years from the
date of the grant: and there was no time limited for its completion.
This Court said, in that case, 6 Peters, 745: " From the evidence
returned with the record, we are abundantly satisfied that the establishment was commenced within the time required, which appears to have been extended for one year beyond that limited in the
grant;) and in a manner which, considering the state of that country, as appears by the evidence, we must consider as a performance
of that part of the condition."
The case of Segui, 10 Peters, 306, was a grant in consideration of
services to the Spanish government, and for erecting machinery for
the purpose of sawing timber. That grant was confirmed by this
Court,, upon the ground that the governor considered the services

486

.SUPREME COURT,
[United Staies v. Kingsley.]

of Segai a sufficient consideration, and made the' grant absolute.
Seton's case, 9 Peters, 311, was a decree or permission of the governor, in all particulars like that now before us; and Seton's right
to the survey which has be n made, and to the equivalent quantity
to make up the extent of the original cotcession, was confirmed by
this Court; upon the positive proof that Seton had built his mill in a
year after the date of the decree upon which, he claimed. Sibbald's
case, 9 Peters, 313, another like Seton's and that before, the Court,
were' confirmied.by this Court, upon the ground tbatSibbald had per-'
formed the condition according to the rules of equity which govern
these cases. Sibbald, in good faith, and. within a reasonable time
after the'decree in his favour', began to build his mill; .expended five
thousand dollars towards it; had his horses aind negroes stolen while
the mill was b'ilding; his milldam carried away by a freshet, in the
absence of his millwright, who was in pursuit of the stolen ptoperty;
rebuilt his mill in 1827,. which.was destroyed by fire the same year;

and the year after, built again another mill of twenty-horse power,
which could saw twenty thousand feet of lumber a day,
It remains only for.us to 'say a word concerning the 19ws and.customs of Spain, supposed by the learned judge in the court below,

,;pplicable to the confirmation of" this claim under the treaty. The
fact that no instance is known of- land so decreed havihg reverted to'

the class'of public lands, for the non-performance of the condition,
does not prove a custom; unless a current of cases can be shown

ir

which claimants have held the land without performance. 'Besides,
the existence of any such'custom is 'disproved by the decree for the
land itself; by the: subsequent decrees of the Spanish governor, declaring lknds, granted upon condition would be null and void within
a certain time, if the conditions were not. performed; and by'the
treaty itself, Which stipulatesfor the performance of conditions.with-.
in terms efter the trepty was made, contained in, the grants- a'nd
which is recognised by this Court by its decision, that the time given
only begins to run Against'indiviUdl rights, from the date of the
'ratification.' As to the laws of Spain, supposed to. aid the case, we
remark,-it being conceded that -the governor had authority to make
grants and concessions, and to give permission to persons to enter
upon lands upon conditions; nothing less than a law dispensing with
the 'performance of them, or. a release of the performance of them by
tw governor, sanctioned by the general royal authority under iwhich
he'acted; or a release by royal authority, after grants were made ge-

neral in its application, or applicable to some particular case or class
of cases, can be admitted, proprio vigore, as a release of the obligations upol: grantees to perform the conditions of these grants. It"is
not pretended that any such-law or release exists.
Mr. Justice BALDwIN dissented.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the superior court for the eastern district of Florida; and was
argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is tbhe opinion of
this Court, that the petitioner having failed to fulfil the condition of
the grant, that the said grant or concession is null and void; aqd
that the said petitioner has no right or title to the land. Whereupon,
it is now here decreed and ordered by this Court, that the ,decree of,
the said superior court in this causi be, and the same is hereby reversed and annulled; and that this cause be, and the sa'me'is hereby
remanded to the said superior court, with directions to enter a decree
in conformity to the opinion of this Court.
