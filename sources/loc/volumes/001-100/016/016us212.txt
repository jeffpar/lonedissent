This was an action of ejectment 'brought by the;defendant in error, (the plaintiff's lessor in the court below,) against the 'present plaintiff, and S. Maxtin, on
the 4th of February, 1807, in the district court for the
district of East Tennesee, which possessed circuit
court powers. The defendant in that court pleaded

oclainmed all right to the residue of the tract specified

in the declaration. A verdict was given for the plaintiff in October term, 1812. From the stqtement contained'in the bill of exceptions, taken at the trial of

Campbell. the cause, it appears that the land for which the action
was brought, is situated between two lines, run in 1779
Ly Walker and Henderson, as the boundary lines of
Virginia and North Carolina. The former state claimed
jurisdiction to the line run by Walker, and the latter to'
the lind run by Henderson. After the separation of
Tennessee from North Carolina, the controversy between Virginia and Tennessee, as to boundary, was settled in 1802, by Tunning a line equidistant from the
former lines. The land in dispute fell within the state
of Tennessee. Both the litigant parties claimed under
grants issued by the state of Virginia, the titles to lands
derived from the said state having been protected by
the act of Tennessee, passed in 1803 for the settlement
of the houndary line.
The plaintiff rested his title on a grant, (founded on
a treasury warrant) to John Jones, dated August the
1st, 1787, for 3,000 acrep; 1,500 acres of which were
conveyed to the lessor by Jones, on the 14th of April
1788; and proved pqssession in the defendant when
the suit was commenced.
The- defendant, to support his title to the said 400
acres, offered in evidence a grant fdr the same to Joseph Martin, dated January 1st, 1788, founded on a
settlement-right, and intermediate conveyances to himself. He also offered in evidence, that a settlement
was made on said land, in 1778, by William Fitzgerald, who assigned his settlement-right to the said Jo-

above grant was issued.. This evidence was rejected
by the court below, The defendant also offered in.evidence a deed of conveyance from the plaintiff's lessor
to Arthur L. Campbell, dated January 2d, 1810, for
the land in dispute; but the same was also rejected.
He also claimed the benefit of the statute of limitations
of the state of Tennessee, on the ground that he, and
those under whom he. claims, had been in continued
and peaceable possession of the 400 acres Â§ince the
year 1788.
The court decided that the statute 'dd not apply.
The cause was then brought before this court by writ
of error.
Mr. LJaw for the plaintiff in error, argued, 1. That
the defendant below ought to haie been permitted to
give evidence showing that his grant had preference
in equity over the plaintiff's grant. By the law, as
settled in Tennessee, the prior settlement right of the
defendant, though an equitable tit]e, might be set up as
a sufficient title in an action at law. The opinion of the
*judge below proceeds on the idea that .the Virginia
practice must prevail, under which such a title could
only be asserted in equity. The acts for carrying into
effect the compact settling the boundary, declare- that
the claims and titles'derived from Virginia shall not be
.affected or prejudiced by the change of jurisdic.

Robiso
The Aftorney General, contra, insisted, that by the CamphelL
compact between the two states, the law of Virginia,
was made the law of the titles to these lands. By
the settled practice of that state, as well as the established doctrine of the common law, the legal title
must prevail iL a court of law. The case of real
property is an exception to the general rule, as to applying the statute of limitations according to the lex
Jori, and not according to the lex loci. Generally
speaking, suits for such property must be commenced
in the courts of the country where the land lies, and,
cousequently, both the right and the remedy are to
be determined 'by one and the same law. But this is
an anomalous case depending, upon the peculiar nature and provisions of the compact of 1802, between
the two states. The statute of ltmitations of Tennessee could not operate upon these lands until they
were ascertained to lie in Tennessee ; and the peculiar
rule established by the courts of Tennessee, permitting
an equitable title to be asserted in an actin.-at law,
would not apply to a controversy concerning titles
wholly depending on :he law of Virginia. The proceedings in ejectment are fictitious in form, but for all
the purposes of substantial justice they are considered
as real. If the term expire pending the action, the
court will permit it to he enlarged, and no conveyance
by the lessor of the plaintiffs while the suit is going on
can operate to extinguish the prior lease. The court

principles. Consistently with this constriution, it may Cfmpbe1L"
be admitted, that where by the statutes of a state, a title, which waild otherwise be deemed merely equitable,
is recognised as a legal title, or a title which would be
good at law, is under circumstances of an equitable nature declared by such statutes to be void, the rights of
the parties, in such case, may be as fully considered in
a suit at law in the courts of the United States, as they
would be in any state court.
In either view of this first point, the court is of opinion that the circuit'court decided right in rejecting the
evidence offered by the original defendant. It was matter proper for the cognisance of a court of equity, and
not admissible in a suit at law.
The next question is, whether the circuit court decided correctly in rejecting the deed of conveyance from
the plaintiff's lessor to Arthur L. Campbell, for'the land
in.controve-rsy made during the pendency of the suit.
The answdr that was given at the bar is deemed decisive; although an action of ejectment is founded in fic-.
tions, yet to certain purposes it is considered in the
same manner as if the whole proceedings were real; for
all the purposes of the suit the lease is to be deemed a
real possessory title. If it expire during the pendency
of the suit, the plaintiff cannot recover his term at law,
without procuring it to be enlarged by the court, and
canproceed only for antecedent damages. In the present case the lease is to be deemed as a good .subsisting

Law, 371. note. And possesssion, although it be 'merely a
naked'possession, or acquired
by wrong, as by disseisen, is
also a title upon which a recovery can.be had. '.For as
Blackstone justly observes, "in

to devest the possession and
assert fis title, such actual

Com. 196. So Jenkins, in his
Centuries of Reports, (42.)
states that the first possession
without any other title, serves
in an assize for land. In Bateman v. Allen, Cro. Eliz. 437,it
was held that the plaintiff was
entitled to recover in ejectment
where it waz found by special
verdict that the defendant had
not the first possession, nor entered under title, but upon the
plaintiff's possession. And in
Allen v.'Rivington, 2 Saun. R.
111, where, upon a special
verdict In ejectment, it appeared that the plaintiff had a priority ofpossession, and no title
was found for the defendant,

of the plaintiff against the de- -.
fendant, and all the world, exceptihg against the rightfl
owner. And in a late case, it
was held, that mere prior occupancy of land, however recent, gives a goocl title to the
occupier, whereupon he may
,recover, as plaintiff, against all
the world, except such as can
prove an older and better title
in themselves: Catteris v.
Cooper, 4 Taunt. 547. See
also, 8 East. 33. And this
doctrine has been frequently

courts. Jackson v. Hazen, 2

that a mere intruder upon

protect his intrusion in a suit

And in Smith v. Lorillard, 10

was held that it is not necessary fr the plaintiffin eject"ment to show, in every case, a
