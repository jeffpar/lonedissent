HAMIPTON V. W'CONNEL.
A judgnent of a state court has the same credit, validity, and effect
in every other court within tto United Stateg, which it had in the
state whare it was rendered; and whatever pleas would be good to
a suit thereon in such state, and none others, can be pleaded in any

other court within the United States.

ERROR to the circuit court of the district of South

The defendant in error declared against the plaintiff
in error, in debt, on a judgment of the suprerme court
of the State of New York, to which the defendant below pleait il debet, and the plaintiff below demurred.
The circuit court rendered a judgment for the plaintiff
below, and thereupon the cause was brought by writ of

two cases. The doctrine there held was that the judgment of, a ptate court should have the same credit, validity and effect, in every other court, of the United
States, which it had in the state where it was pronoun'ced, and that whatever pleas would be g.ood to a suit

v Fitch, 15. Tohns. ,lep,121.
1818.

in the supreme court of NewYork, it seems to have been
supposed that 'this court had
decided in Mills v. Duryee,
that nul tiel record was the
only proper plea to an action
upon a state judgment. But
it is connived that as to the
pleadifig, it only decided that
nil debef %as not a proper plea;
and that the court would hold
that any plea (as well as MIT
fiel record) that would avoid
the juldgment, if technically
pleaded, would be good.
However this may be, it may
safely be affirmed, that tile
question is still open in this
court whether a special plea
of frauid might not be pleaded,
or a plea to the juri,diction of
the court in xdiich the judgment was obtained; for these
might, in' sone cases, be
pleaded in the state court to
avoid the judgment.
