This ship was libelled for taking on board, at the
Island of Jamaica,, vith the knovledge of the master,
51 puncheons of rum, 23 barrels,,of limex, and 20
barrels of pimento, with intention to import the same
into the United States,, contrary to the provisions of
an act of Congress interdicting commercial intercourse between Great Britain and the United States,
something of grave necessity;
scLh as is spoken of in our
hooks, where a ship is' said to
b'e driven in by stress of weather. It is not sufficient to say
it was done to avoid a little bad
weather, or in consequence of
foul winds; the danger must
be such as to cause apprehension in the mind of 'ad honest
and firm man. I do not mean
to say that there must he an,
actual physical necessity existing at the moment; a moral
necessity would justify the act;
where, for instance, the ship
had sustained previous damage
so as to render it dangerous tothe lives of the persons on
board to prosecute the voyage:
Such a case,thoilgh there might
be no existing storm, Would be
viewed with tenderness ; but

there muit be at least a moral
necessity. Thenagainwhere
the party justifies the act upon
the plea of distress, it must not
be a distress which he has created himself, by putting on
board an insufcient quantity of
water or of provisionp for such
a voyage ; for there the distress is only a part of the mechanism of the fraud, and cannot be set up in excse for it;
and in the next place, the distress must be proved by the
claiwantinu clear and satisfactory manner. It is evidence

was interposed by John Troup, of the city
of New-York, merchant, which denies the allegation
of the libel, as to the intention with which the articles
mentioned in the libel were put on board at Jamaica;
and as to the importation, he states, that on or about
the 6th -of October, 1811, the said ship, with the said
cargo on board, being on the high seas on the American coast about five leagues 'distant from land, and having lost .her rudder, and being otherwise disabled, was,
by stress of weather, compelled to put into the port of
New York, contrary to the will and, design of the master, and against the express orders of the claimant, as
owner thereof, communicated to the said master before
his arrival.
On board the vessel were two manifests of the cargo, both of which stated the cdrgo to have been laden
on board at Montego bay, in Jamaica; but one of
them declared her destination to be, Amelia Island,
and the other New-York. The latter was delivered
to an officer of the customs, and a ceitificate by him
endorsed thereon, stating that fact, dated the, 14th
October, 1811.
The other manifest was exhibited
at the custom.house in New-York, on the 25th October, 1811, at which time the master took the oath
usual on such occasions, stating that the said manifest contained a true account of all the goods on
board, and that there were not any goods on board, the
importation of which into the United States, was prohibited ly law.

of the vessel was voluntary on the part of the masT'e

New-York.
The claimant has first endeavoured to clear the trans.'
action of all illegality in its inception, and thinks he
has offered testimony sufficient to satisfy the court that
there was no intention at the time of loading at TJamaica, to import the cargo into the United States.
When an act takes place, which in itself, and unexplained, is a violation of law, and the inducements
to such infraction are great, it will not be thought un
reasonable in a court,' to expect from a -party who
seeks relief against its consequences, the most satisfactory proofs of innocence, especially, as such proof will
generally be within his reach. If theni any papers,
which in the course of sich a transaction must have
existed, are not produced, or if any others which come
to light, do not correspond with the master's relation ;
and especially, if all the witnesses who fare in the power, and many of them in the interest, and under the influence of the party, are omitted to be examined, when,
it is impossible that they should not be intimately .acquainted with the most material circumstances ; and
instead of thisi the chief, if not only reliance of the
claimant, is placed on the evidence of a party, who, if
the allegations "of the libel be true, is himself liable, to
a vexy heavy penalty; when such a case occurs, a
court must be expected to look at the proofs before it,
with more than ordinary suspicion and distrust.

this, he satisfie;s himself with the examination of the
master ; who states, that he had orders from his owner, not to take on board at Jamaica any W,st India produce for the Unite~d States. What is become of these
orders ? Does a master sail on a foreign voyage with
verbal instructions only? This is, not the common
course of business. Instructions to a makter of a vessel are generally in writing; and foi.the owners greater security, there is, always left with him, a
c'opy certified or acknowledged by the former.
If so, why are they not produced? They would
speak for- themselves,- and be entitled to more
credit than the declarations of a person so deeply interested to misrepresent the transaction, as. this witness is. The court, therefore, might well throw out
of the case the little that is said of these instruction,
so long as they are not produced ; and it is not pretended that they were not reduced to writing, or if
they were, that they are lost ; which, indeed, is not a
very supposable event, if the ordinary precautions- on
this occasion have been observed. But notwithstanding these very positive orders, the master, in direct violation of them, and at the hazard of the most serious
consequences to himself, takes on board a' cargo expressly prohibited by his owner, in 'compliance with
the directions and opinion of a consignee, whose
name is also withheld, and who does not appear to,
have had any right to interfere in this way. So

-ofthe non-intercourse act, and that, he, accordingly,
did not mean to come in if that act were still in force.
But how does this appear? Nothing of the kind is
stated in his deposition ; on .the, contrary, his -coming
in, according to his own account, depended not on the
repeal of this law, but on the orders of his owner;he came, he says, on this coast, with intention to obey,
the orders of the consignee, not to attempt to con~e
into port unless he received orders from the owner,
off S~ndy Hook, so to do. If, therefore, he had found
those laws yet in force, which he probably had heard
was the case, soon after his coming on the American
coast, and long before he fell in with the pilot boat
-which carried down the letter of his owner, he still
intended to have come in, if his owner had ordered
him so to do. His intention, therefore, as taken from
his own relation, is "not altogether of that innocent"
nature which it has been represented to be. When the
-vessel siled from Jamaica, does not exactly appear;

was there in August, and met with a gale on the 6th

testimony in this case, carry with it that 'full conviction of the vis major which ought to be made out to
avoid the effects of an illicit importation ? It will not
be right -of proper for the court, in considering this
part of the case, to devest itself of those suspicions
which were so strongly excited in the first stage of
this transaction, for if it were not very clearly made
out that the lading of these goods on board was innocent, it will be some excuse for the incredulity
which the court may discover respecting the tale of
subsequent distress. On this point, also, the claimant is satisfied with the testimony of the master. Not
a single mariner, not one of the passengers, although
several were on board, is brought forward in support
of his relation. Of -the wardens' survey, nbtice will
preseftly be taken. Now, admitting the master's story
to be true, with those qualifications, however, which
ire inevitable, he has made out as weak a case of
necessity as was ever offered to a curot, in the many
instances of this kind which occurred during the existence of the restTictive system. A gale of less than
twenty hours continuance was 'all the bad weather
that Was encountered, in which it is said the rudder
was carried away and the foresail split; the rudder
pay have been injured, but it could not have been carried away, if it he true, as from the master's own account must have been th case, that the vessel after
this accident made at least one thousand ,miles in the
course of the first five days, immediately after. * But

CASES IN THE SUPREME COURT
it is said that is no evidence as to the place where the
~ accidhnt; happened. Of this fact the survey producThe
NewYork. ced by the - claimant himself is conclusive. It was
taken from the mouth of the captain himself, mnd if
he or the wardens committed a mistake in this impor-'
tant particular, why was it not corrected by an examioation of the master, or a production of the log-book ?
Nor has it escaped the attention of the court, that if
the New-York were disabled 'in lat. 27, 30 north,
long. 80 west, she might have reached- Amelia Island,
her pretended poit of destination; with much more
ease, and in much less time than she eraployed in
sailing more than ten degrees to the north, and taking
her station off Sandy Hook; for she was, ori the 6th
df October, mu ,h nearer to that island, and the wind
was'as fair as could be desired to carry her there.
The plea of distress, therefore, is contradicted by a
fact which could not have existed,,. if it? had been as
great as is now pretended -'nor can it be believed, if
any great danger had been produced by the gale of
the 6th of October, that either the crew or the passengers would have submitted, not only to come so
many degrees to the north, 'but continue hovering on
the coast until the owner could be heard from. No
.leak appears to have been the consequence of the
storm, no mrast was lost, nor any part of the cargo
thrown overboard; and if she steered and sailed as
well as it seems she did, without a rudder, even a loss
so veryt essential and serious to other vessels, must
be allowed to have worked little or no injury whatever in this ase. To the subsequent surveys by the

lion of the New York; but little importance is to be
attached. It'appears to have been an ex parte pro-New.yorL,
ceeding, and if all the injuries which they describe existed, as-they no doubt.did, it is not certain Whether
they were produced by the gale spoken of, or by any
other accident at sea, or by the act of the master himself; and, at any rate, their recommending repairs before she .'vent to sea again was very natural, the vessel being then in p6rt; but is no proof at all that she
might not as well, and better, have gone to Amelia
Islands as to have come to that port. The letter to
the master, which .has been produced, does not place
in i very fair light the pretensions of the claimant.
However unpleasant the task, thecourt is constrain'ed
to make some remarks on it. I seems agreed that it
is but little calculated to lull ihe suspicions which other parts of this case'have excited. The interpretatio.n
resorted 'to by the claimant is at variance with the
only appropriate sense of the terms -which are used,
and with the most manifest intentions of the writer.'
By changing the Port of departure, nothing else could
have'been intended than to legalize the voyage by
the crew swearirig that the New-York had sailedfrom some West-India possession, not under the do-,.
minion of Great Britain. This sense of the letter,
which seems inevitable, .is but little favourable to the
character of the claimant,- or to the integritj of the
transaction. Nor .should iftbe forgotten, that the reaster'dloes not decide upon coming in until-this lettdr is
received; whereas, if his situation were as perilous as
he now repreieuts it, he could not; and would not

have waited or orderS. "It is unnecessary to rely
much on the two manifests ;- although one of them,
The
NIew-Yrk. bearing on its race a destination for New-York, is
certainly much at variance with the pretended contingent destination of this vessel. The oath which
the master made at the custom-house,'that no goods
were on board of the New-York, the imporiation of
which was prohibited by law, was not only false, but
is an evidence of very great incaution on his part ; for
if the collector would administer the oath in no other
form, it was no reason -,hatever for his attesting to
a fact, the falsity of which was apparent on le very
manifest wlhich was attached to the oath.
The alleged opposition of the crew to' wait for
fuither orders, and their threats to come up in the
pilot-boat, have not been overlooked. This allega.tion depends altogether on the credit due to the master, and is a circumstance not very probable in itself.
No pilot , in the Lhen condition of the New-York,
could havebeen so ignorant, and so regardless of his
,duty, as to take from her, without the master's consent, an.y part, much less the whole, of her crew. If
the threat, therefore, were really made, the master
ought not to have been alarrned at it, and probably
would- have treated it with contempt, if it had not
been suggested by himself, or had not suited his then
purpose; at any rate, if by remaining longer at sea
than he ought to have done, or by hovering on the
coast in expectation of orders from his owners, after
having received so many injuries on the 6th of October, and additional dafiger were produced, or wellgrounded apprehensions and opposition on the part

imprudence, if not his own fault, occasioned. The
towing ot the New-York into port by a pilot boat, is
supposed to be a circumstance which must have proceeded from her disabled condition.
"Thisdoes not
follow. It may have liroceeded, from the request
of her master; for it* can hardly be believed that
a vessel that had behaved so well after the gale
of the 6th October, and which is not stated to have
met wO.h any injury from subsequent causes, should,
the moment it was necessary to take a pilot on
board, be so ungovrhable as to require towing into
port. If this were really tije case, it is a matter of
some surprise, that the claimant should not have recourse to the pilot himself to establish the fact, and the
reason of it.
Notwithstanding the untoward circumstances, whiclt
have already been taken notice of, and the temptations
which existed to commit violations of, the restrictive
laws, which it is known were great, and-led to frequent
infractions of them, the court is asked to icquit this
property, without producing the letter of ifistructions
to the master, or the orders to the consignee in Jamaica, where 'it is alleged there was one,. although

Mr. Justice JoHNsoN. This is a Iibel against the
cargo of the ship New-York. The vessel herself was
libelled for lading a cargo with intent to violate the
laws of the United States; but the cargo in this case
is libelled as forfeited, for having been imported into
the city of New-York contrary to law. The intent
-with which it was laden on board becomes immaterial as. to the cargo, except so far as it might
operate to cast a shade of suspicion over the act of
coming into port. The defence set up- is, that the

New-York if legal, and if not, to bear away-for Ame- "
The
lia Island. That she was ordered to call off the portNew.york
of New-irork for information; and in her voyage
thither she encountered a storm, from which she su3tained such damages as to oblige her to put into NewYork for the safety'of the lives of the passengers and,
crew. That a vessel under such circumstances has a
right to call off a port for information has been de.
cided in various cases; and it has, also, been decided,
and is not ,low questioned, that if in the prosecution
of that voyage, she sustains such damage as renders it
unsafe to keep the sea, she might innocently enter
the ports of the Tnited States to repair, and resume her'
voyage. The laws of the United States make provision in such ,cases f6r securing the cargo to prevent an
evasion efour trade-laws.
There are, then, but two questions in the case: 1st
Whether her actual state of distress was such as to make
it unsafe for her to keep the seas? 2d.- Whether that
state of distress was the effect of design or accident?
Admitting that the greatest frauds that can be imagined
had been proven to have been in contemplation, yet
as the libel does not' charge a lading with intent to
import into the United States, it is immaterial to this de-

cision to inquire what "was intefided, if it be'made
to appear that the distress, was real, and not pretended or fictitious. Now, as far as I can judge, the facts
in this case are such as* leave nothing for the mind to
halt upon. The distress was obvious 'to the senses,
and the nature of it such as could not have been pro.
duced by the ingenuity of man. Without dwelling

or, in the words of the survey, gone; and the sternpost,'after sheathing, and cbunterplank much chafed.
These words car-ried away and gone, mean, in nautical language, wholly disabled o xendered useless.
And that puch was the 'state of the rudder is evident
from the contents of the surveys. For, when the vessel was hove keel out, it appeared that the middle rudder
brace was broken, and the crown of the lower brace
gone; so that it is evident the rudder must have
swung in the chains. And that this was the case
appears from sev'eral particulars, also gethered from
the surveys: 1st. The impossibility, on sny other
supposition, to believe, that the surveyors would on
the first survey, before the .vessel was hove-down,
report the rudder gone. 2d. The chafed state of the
rudder and-stern post, could only have been produced
by the' action of the ruddef against the stern-post,
when . forced to and fro by the waves, and must have
occurred at sea. And, lastly, the same cause naturalli produced the injury reported to have been done
to her counter-plank andfter sheathing. These injuries, I repeat, could not have been done by the
hand of man, especially those' gustained under water;
and although I see neither frafid nor falsehood in the
case, yet I care not though every word of the testimony,' besides, be false:' that falsehood could neither
have produced these injuries, nor repaired them; and
the evidence is sufficient to show that the safety of
