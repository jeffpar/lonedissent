that any endorsement whatever can vest the legal title
to a bill of exchange in the United States, so as to rendler them capable of maintaining an action on it in their

The treasurei of the United States has no authority,
ex offirio, ta draw, or endorse, or otherwise negotiate
bills. - The only oficers of the government who possess the power of drawing bills are the commissioners
of the Sinking Fund. To them it is expressly given
by law. But a power to draw or endorse bills as an
agent cannot be delegated to another, u6less the power
of substitution be expressly given.a" Besides, the agent
constituted by the commissioners was the secretary of
the treasury, who employed, not Tucker, but another
person, to purchase the bill. Where a bill is payable
to A. for the use of B., the latter has only an equitable,
riot a legal, interest. The right of assignment is in the

lows:
The first question which will be disposed of, although not the first in the orderof argument, will be,
whether the endorsement of this bill to Mr. Tucker,under the peculiar circumstances attending the transaction did not'pass such an interest to the United States,
as to enable them to sue in'their own name.' In deciding this -point, it will be taken for granted, that no
doubt can arise on the special verdict as to the party
really interested in this bill. It was purchased with
the money of the United States. It was endorsed, to
their treasurer; it was registered at their treasury; it 'was
forwarded by their secretary of the treasury, to'whom
it was returned, after it' had been dishonoured,for and
on behalf, as the jury expressly find, of the United
States. Indeed, without .d.enying the'bill to be the
property of the United States it is supposed that the ac-
