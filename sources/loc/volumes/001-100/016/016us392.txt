Tile fEolUS. itwas their intention to have gone to Wiscasset, or
Portland, where. they were to discharge, b ut" owing to
the bad'state of their rigging, and the wind being ahead,
they put into, Mount Desert, where they were detained
by the custom-house officer. He also states; that it
vas agreed, in Liverpool, with all the sailors, himself
'and the cook excepted, that they should come to the
United States, and return froia thence t. ';-erpool.
About thwe months after, the mate was examinedagain*
when he told a story so. different from the relation
which is.found'in his first deposition, that but little
credit is due to himas a witness for either party.
Lingman, oneof the mariners of the ,XEolus, swore,
that he was shipped on board that vessel ir-October
last, she then lying.in Liverpool, on a voyage' to some
iort in America, and from thence .back to -,ome port in
Europe.
Daniel Molus, master of the Eolus, testified, tnat
io October, 1813, he camne to Liverpool, from Bjornburg in the Brig lEolus. One Lour ande, -who was master of thebrig, having a poWer to charter her as he
rcight think proper, did charter her to Frantz Scholtz, of
Archangel, by his agent, David Morgan, on a voyage
-tp the. Havanna, and a- 'port,in North or South

verpool. Two ,days after, he was ordered 'by the supercargo to proceed off the port of Wiscasset, and
land some passengers, when he would receive further
orders from the supercargo, who expected to find
further orders there. On their passage, the 'brig had
thirteen of her chains broken, some of them in the
.eye round the bolt, and therefore could -not be repaired until some of the cargo was dischargea. Five of
her* shrouds were carried away, the bolts in the heel
of her bowsprit were broken, and the bowsprit -came
some in upon deck. The stern boat was,. by a sea,
stove in pieces at the stern and lost, with several light
sails which had been thown into her. The spritsail
yard was lost ; her waist-rails and boards' were
wholly carried away by the sea. The -binnacle was
severaltimes capsized, and the compasses very much
injured. One of the passengers was lost overboard.
The brig was short of water; and at the time of her
arrival'on the American coast, the crew was in very
great distress, being on a short allowance of water,
-which was very thick and bad, and not fit to be used
until it was boiled, to make it -thin. There was rio
rigging to repair the vessel any longer. On the 17th
of February, 1814, a council of the whole ship'u
crew and passengers was held, and all were of opinion it was very dangerous' keeping longer at sea;
-and were for getting into the first port which could
be'made. The supercargo reluctantly-consented. If
he had not, the brig miust have gone in, as her cni.
tion would. have justified the act, In the afternoontof the 18th of Febrnary, 1814, the -Zolus anchored

formed him that -the vessel had been seized for an alleged. violation of the non-impartatioir law; He reMrgan, the
ceived his instructions as supercargo from
agent of Scholtz, in London%and they were verbal instructions oply. He did not recollect that he had ever
received any letter, either frqm Morgan or Scholtz,
concerning this voyage. He is .a native of Massachu
setts, but had not resided- in. the United States for
about four years previous to the commencement of this
voyage. Since the *arrival of the XEolus, he has resided nearly two years in New-York. All the papers he
had were repeipts from the cartmen in Liverpool, *and
they were bundled together in the cabin, from which
place he took them and delivered them to Wood, who,
he presumes, has them.
It appears by the testimony of Robert Kelly, that
Wood informed hini,' in the beginning of February,
1814, that 'he expected a brig from the West Indies,
and a Russian brig to call off the mouth of Sheepscot' river'for orders, and to know whether they can enter.
He desires Kelly, by letters Which are produced, to
keep a good look out for.these vessels, to.direct the
one from the West Indies to proceed to Newport, and
to inform the c:zptain or supercargo of the Russian brig,
that the laws will not admit of his entering, unless he
is in want of something, in which case he may put into
the mouthof the river. Kelly cruized off the mouth
of the river for abput four weeks, when he heard from
Wood, that the Russian: vessel had put ino'Mount Desert, and was seized.

and in which Wood also stated that he had offered
the mate money, to contradict the testimony he had
given for Jordan.
John Bridges swears, that, being in Liverpool, in
November, 1813, with six other Americans, they were
applied to by Mr. Richards, of the house of Ogden,
Richards, & Selden, who offered to find them clothes,
to pay their board while at Liverpool, and to find them
a passage to America. He accordingly supplied them
with clothes, paid their board eight weeks, and then
put them on board the Russian brig _2Edlug, in which
they sailed for Portland.
Samuel Haddock, jun. an inspector of the customs,
went on board of the brig when she came into BassHarbour, and demanded her papers of the supercargo,
which he refused to give up, as he was determined to
pr6ceed further to the westward. He understood from
the mate, that the supercargo had taken the bills of the
argo from him, and burnt them. He thinks the brig
might have proceeded on her voyage to the Havanna, when she came into Bass-Harbour, with such reof
pairs as might have been made on board. None

Abraham Richardson was put on bbard the btig as art
inspector of the customs, when she was seized, and
continued! on board till the cargo wag discharged, which'
was about 25 aays. He overheard' a conversation between Wood and the supercargo in the stateroom of
the latter, in which Wood "expressed a wish that the
brig had got to Wiscasset, as he Had' told the collector
at that place that the brig was coming, and'that he had
offered him 10,000 if hewould let her enter. He observed that the collector did not tell him whether he
would, but he believed that if the vessel had put in
there they would have got her off very easy. The supercargo observed to Wood, that if it was known that
he, Wood, was concerned in the voyage it would condemn vessel and cargo. Wood' replied, "You must be
very careful not to drop 6, word" about it. We must
make it out Russian property, if we can."- The supercargo then remarked, that.if the collector would' not
clear out the brig for Wiscasset, they must make her
out as bad'as possible, so that she could not be movhd,"
and then bond the cargo; upon which Wood observed,.
that if it was condemned they should then make a good
voyage, as the bonds would -not be much more than
thd double duties. This witness heard no complaints

Mr. D. B. Ogen, and Mr. Wheaton, for the appellants and claimafbts, argued upon the facts, that the
cargo was n6t put on board with intent to import the
same into the United States, hut that the, primary
destination was to the Havanna, with orders to call
off the coast ofthis country, and to enter, in case the
nonI-importation laws should be repealed. But even
if the fact were ever so well established)'that the cargo was originally put on board with intent to import
it into the United States, congress could not, consistently wit]V the prinQip'es of universal law, forfeit the
property offoreigners for an act done by them, in a foreign port. The putting on board the prohibited commooities with intention to inport, is made a distinct, substantive offence, by the 5th section of the
act of the 1st 9f March, 1809,' ch. 195. This offence
was con summated within a foreign territory. If. the
vessel had been captured on the high seas,. before her
arrival in the United States, she would have heen taken "in deicto, according to any construction by
which this section can be applied to foreigners. The
legislature might, indeed, intend to confiscate the
property ofour own citizens) for acts done by them in
foreign countries, because their allegiance travels

Mr. Scholtz, a Russian merchant'at Archargel, in
time of war between.this country and Great Britain,
and during the existence of our non-importation act,
loads at that place no less than five brigs with the
proditits of Russia, which he commits to the ,care of
Mr. Morgan, a merchant at Liverpool, with instructions; as is said, to invest the proceeds of those cargoes in such British manufactures as he might judge
suitable for sale inthe Havanna. Mr. Morgan, who
at or about the time of loading these vessels, was at
Archangel, proceeds to Liverpool, disposes of the
cargoes there, charters the Russian brig-Eolus, and
d~spatches her, for the Havanna, to the addiess of'
certaifn merchants there, who are informed by a letter
from him of the origin of thig adventure, and that he

good, or even saving prices, and after investing the T
proceeds in certain produce, to load the _Eolus and send
her to Mr. Scholtz, at Archangel. i'he instructions of
Mr. Scholtz, in an affair of so much magnitude, no
where appear in the proceedings ; but if they were, in
truth, of the kind stated by Mr. Morgan himself,' in his
letter, which has just been referred to, we shall find
there was a total departure from them ; for not only
was the cargo of the 'Eolus the most unsuitable which
could~have been selected f(,r a warm climate; but the
Havanna, to which alonE, by his own account, he was
to send the A"olus, was to be her port of destinati6n only in case she could not enter a port of the United
States. When we find so great a departure fr'om instructions as would inevitable. fix upon the agent, a
responsibility to'the whole extent of the property pommitted to his charge, we may-well be permitted to doubt
of their existence altogether, and to suspect that Mr.
Morgan is acting in the character of a lprincipal, and
not, as he would have us believe, in that of a humble subordinate agent. This suspicion is not diminished,
when we find, that although th'is suit has been pending
between two and three years,_Mr. Scholtz has interfered with it neither in pei son, nor has he thought it worth
his while to appoint any agent for that purpose.
After the purchase of a cargo principally- calculated

was observed on this sabject by the master and othersj

of distress was a matter of conceit between the siipercargo of Mr. Wood. It also appears by other witnesses in the cause, that the Eolus, rotwithsta.nding the

The two, principal citcumstances relied on as indicira

an ekplanation perfectly consistent with innocence.
For Pt is well known that a neutral never clears out

isprecis~ly what she avow, that her intention Was oAdaposite it in that marl~t had the prohibition. Beea taken off on her arrival.
Under these circumstances, it appears to me that the.

no sufficient cause for condemnation, and the vessel

this collector was less under the influence of humanity
and a s-nse of duty, than that of avarice, in making this
seizure. Had he libelledher as enemy's proplerty, I
