THE BANK OF AUGUSTA, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR, VS. JOSEPH B. EARLE,
DEFENDANT IN ERROR.
THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR, VS. WILLIAmiI D. PRIMROSE, DEFENDANT IN ERROR.
THE NEW ORLEANS AND CARROLLTON RAILROAD COMPANY, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR, VS. JOSEPH B. EAR'LE, DEFENDANT IN ERROR.
An action was instituted in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Distr~et of Ala-

bama, by the Bank of Augusta, Georgia, against the defendant, a citizen of Alabama,
on bills of exchange drawn at Mobile, Alabama on New York, which had been protested
for non-payment, and returned to Mobile. The bill was made and endorsed for the purpose of being discounted by the agent of the bank, who had funds in his hands belonging
tQ the plaintiffs for the purpose of purchasing bills of exchange, which funds were derived
from bills and notes, discounted by the bank in Georgia. The bills were discounted by
the agefit of the bank, in Mobile, for the benefit of the bank, with their funds, to remit the
said funds to the bank. The defendant defended the suit on the facts that the bank of
Augusta is a corporation incorporated by an act of the legislature of Georgia, and have
power such as is usually conferred on banking institutions, such as to purchase bills of exchange, &c. The Circuit Court held that the' plaintiffs could not recover on the bills of
exchange, and that the purchase of the bills by the agent of the plaintiffs were prohibited
by the laws of Alalbama, and gave-judgment for the defendant. In the case of the Bank
of the United States- of Pennsylvania vs. Primrose, the plaintiffs, a corpor tion by virtue
of a law of the state of Pennsylvania, authorized by its charter to sue and be sued in the
name of the corporation, and to deal in bills of exchange, and composed of citizens of
Pennsylvania, and of states of the United States, other than the state of Alabama, the
agent of the bank resident in Mobile, and in possession of funds belonging to the bank,
and intrusted with them for the sole purpose of purchasing bills of exchange; purchased,
a bill of exchange, and paid for the s.me in notes of the branch of the bank of Alabama,
at Mobile. The bill was protested for non-payment, and a suit was instituted in the'
Circuit Court against the payee, the endorser of the bill.. The question for the opinion
of the Circuit Court was, whether the purchase of the bill of exchange by the bank of'
the United States was a valid cpntract, under the laws of Alabama. The Circuit Court
decided that the contract was void, and gave judgment for'the defendant. The case of
the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company vs. Joseph B. Earle, was similar to
that of the Bank of Augusta vs. Joseph B. E vle. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court in the three cases; and held the contracts for the purchase
of the-bills valid; and that the plaintiffs acquired a legal title to the bills by the purchase.
In the case of the Bank of the United States vs. Deveaux, the Supreme Court decided, that,
in a question of jurisdiction they might look to ite character of the persons composing a
corporation; and if it appeared that they were citizens of another state, and the fact was
set forth by proper averments, the corporation might sud in its corporate name in the
Courts of the United States. But in that case the Court confined.its decision, in express
terms, to a question of jurisdiqtion; to a right to sue; and evidently went, even so far,
with some hesitation. The propriety of that decision is fully assented to, and it has ever
'since been recognised hs authority in this Court.. But the principle "has never been extended any farther than it was carried in that case; and has never been qupposed to
extend to contracts made by a corporation. especially in another sovereignty.
The n ature and character of a corporation ca, , 1 by statute, and the extent of the powers
which it may lawfully exereise, have upon seetml casions been under consideration in
this Court. The cases of Head and Amory ts. The Providence Insurance Company, 2
Cranch, 167; aild the Dartmouth'Cgllege vs, Woodward, 4 Wheaton, 636, cited.
Whenever a corporation makes a contract, it is the contract of the legal entity; of the arti.ficial being ceated by the charter, and not the contract of the individual members. The
only rights it can claim are the rights which are given'to it in that character, and not
Ihe rights which belong to, its.membprs as citizens of a state.

520

SUPREME COURT.

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]
It may be safely assumed, that a corporation can make no contracts, and do no acts, either
within or without the state which creates it, except such as are authorized by its charter;,
and those acts must also be done by such officers or agents, and in such manner as the
charter authorizes," And, if the law creating a corporation does not, by the true construction of the words used in the charter, give it the right to exercise its powers beyond the
limits of the state, all contracts made by it in other states would be void.
It is very true that a corporation can have no legal existence out of the boundaries of the
sovereignty by which it is created. It exists only in contemplation of law, and by force
of the law; and where that law ceases to operate, and isno longer obligatory, the corporation can have no existence., It must dwell in the place of its creation, and cannot
migrate to another sovereignty. But although it must live and have its being in that
state only, yet it does not by any means follow that its existence there will not be recognised in other places; and its residence in one state creates no insuperable objection to
its powerof contracting in another. It is indeed a mere artificial being, invisible and
intangible; yet it is a person for certairi purposes, in contemplation of law; and has been
recognised as such by the decisions of this Court. It is sufficient that its existence as
an artificial person, in the state of its creation, is acknowledged and recognised by the
law of the nation where the dealing takes place.; and that it is permitted by the laws of
that place, to exercise there the powers with which it is endowed.
Courts of justice have always expounded and executed contracts made in a foreign country
according to the laws of the place in which they were made; provided that law was not
repugnant to the laws or policy of their own country. The c6mity thus extended to
other nations is no impeachment of sovereignty. It is the voluntary act of the nation by
which it is offered; and is inadmissible when contrary to its policy, or prejudicial to its
interests. But it contributes so largely to promote justice between individuals, and to
produce a friendly intercourse between the sovereignties to ,which they belong; that
Courts of justice have continually acted upon it, as a part of the voluntary .iw of
nations.
The Court can perceive no sufficient reason for excluding from the protection of the law the
contracts of foreign corporations; when they are not contrary to the knwn policy of the
state, or injurious to its interests. It is nothing more than the admission of the existence of an artificial person created Py the law of another state; and clothed with the
power of making certain contracts. It is but the usual comity of recognising the law
of another state.
The states of the Union are sovereign states; and"the history of the past and the events
which are daily occurring, furnish the strongest evidence that they have adopted towards
each other the laws of comity in their fullest extent.
In 'the legislation of Congress, where the states and the people of the several states are all
represented, we shall find proof of the general understanding in the United States'that
by the law of comity among the states, the corporations chartered by one, Were permitted
to make contracts in the others.
It is well settled, that by the law of comity amopg nations, a cbrporation created by one
sovereignty is permitted to make contracts in another, and to sue in its Courts; and that
the same law of comity prevails among the 'several sovereigntles of this Union. The
public, and welftknown and long continued usages of trade, the general acquiescence of
the states; the particular legislation of some of them, as well as the legislation of Congress; all concur in proving the truth of this proposition.
Franchises are special privileges conferred by government upon individuals, and which do
not belong to the citizens of the country generally of common right.

It is essential to

the character of a franchise, that it should be a grant from the sovereign authority; and
in this country, no franchise can be held which is not derived from a law of the state.
The comity of suit brings with it the comity of contract; and where the one is expressly
adopted by the ,Courts, the other must also be presumed, according to the usages of
nations, unless the coistrary can be shown.
The state of Alabama has not merely acquiesced by silence, but her judicial tribunals have
declared the adoption of the law of international comity in the case of a suit.
[he state of Alabama never intended, by its constitution, to interfere with the right of selling or purchasing bills of exohange.
When.the, policy of a state is maniest, the Courts of the United States would be bound
to notice it, as a part of its code of laws; and to declare all contracts in the state, repugnant to it, to be illegal and void.

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

IN error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the southern,
district of Alabama.
These cases were brought from the Circuit Court of the southern
district of Alabama, by the plaintiffs in each case, by writs of error.
The cases of the Bank of Augusta vs. Joseph B. Earle, and of the
Bank of the United States vs. William D. Primrose, were argued by
counsel. The case of the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad
Company was submitted by Mr. Ogden, on the argument in the
other causes.
In the case of the Bank of Augusta vs. Joseph B. Earle, the.
facts were the following:The Bank of Augusta, incorporated by the legislature of the state
of Georgia, instituted in the Circuit Court for the southern district
of Alabama, in March, 1837, an action against Joseph B. Earle, a
citizen of the state of Alabama, on a bill of exchange, dated at Mobile,.
November 3, 1836, drawn at sixty days sight, by Fuller, Gardner,,
and Co., on C. B. Burland and Co., of New York, in favour of Joseph
B. Earle, and by him endorsed, for six thousand dollars. The bill
was accepted by the drawees, but was afterwards protested for
non-payment; and was returned with protest to the plaintiffs.
The following facts were agreed upon by the counsel for the,
plaintiffs and the defendant; and were submitted to the Circuit
Court:"The defendant defends this action upon the following facts that
are admitted by the plaintiffs; that plaintiffs are a corporation, incorporated by an act of the legislature of the state bf Georgia, and
have power usually conferred upon banking institutions, such as to.
purchase bills of exchange, &c. That the bill sued on was made
and endorsed for the purposo of being discounted, by Thomas,
McGran, the agent of said bank, who had funds of the plaintiffs in
his hands, for the purpose of purchasing bills, which funds were
derived from bills and notes, discounted in Georgia by said plaintiffs,
and payable in Mobile, and the said McGran, agent as aforesaid,
did so discount and purchase the said bill sued on, in the city of"
Mobile, state aforesaid, fox the benefit of said bank, and with their
funds; and to remit said funds to the said plaintiffs.
"If the Court shall say that the facts constitute a defence to this
action, judgment will be given for the defendant, otherwise for plaintiffs, for the amount of the bill, damages, interest and costs; either
party to have the right of appeal or writ of error to the Supreme;
Court, upon the statement of facts, and the judgment thereon."
The Circuit Court gave judgment for the defendant.
The Bank of the United States, incorporated by the legislature,
of the State of Pennsylvania, as the holders of a bill of exchange.
protested for non-payment, for five thousand three hundred and fifty
dollars, drawn by Charles Gascoine, at Mobile, on the 14th January,
1837, ht four months, on J. and C. Gascoine, of New York, in favour of
NN. D. Primrose, and by him endorsed, instituted in October, 1837,
an action against the endorser of the bill, in the Circuit Court foa.

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

the-southern district of Alabama. The agieed facts of the case,
which were submitted to the Circuit Court, were as follow."The -plaintiffs are a body corporate, existing under and by virtue
of a law of the state of Pennsylvania, authorized by its charter to
su.and be sued by the name of the President, Directors, and Company of the Bank of the United States, and to deal in bills of exchange, and is composed of citizens of Pennsylvania, and of states
of the United States other than the state of Alabama. The defendant is a citizen 'of the state of Alabama. George Poe, Jr.,
was the agent of the plaintiffs, resident in Mobile, and in the
possession of funds- belonging to the plaintiffs, intrusted to him for
the sold purpose of purchasing bills of exchange. The said George
Poe, Jr., as such agent, on the 14th day of January, A. D. 1837,
purchased at Mobile the bill declared upon, and paid for the same in
notes of the branch of.the Bank of the State of Alabama, at Mobile. The defendant is the payee of the bill, and endorsed it to
plaintiffs, the present holders. The bill was presented ftt maturity
to the acceptors, and duly protested for non-payment; and due and
legal notice given to the defendant.
The question 'for the opinion of the Court on the foregoing statement of facts is, whether the purchase of the. said bill of exchange
by the plaintiffs, as aforesaid, was a valid contract under the laws
of Alabama. If the Court be of opinion thaf the said Contract was
valid, and that the said plaintiffs, as holders of the said bill, acquired
the legal title thereto by the said purchase, then judgment to be rendered for the plaintiffs for the sum of 5,350 dollars, with interet at
eight per cent. since 30th May, 1837, and ten per cent. damages on
it. But if the Court be of opinion that the said purchase was prohibited by the laws of, Alabama, and the contract was therefore invalid and void, judgment to be rendered for the defendant."
The Circuit Court gave judgment for the defendant.
The action of the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company,
incorporated by an a6t of the legislature of Louisiana, was upon a
bill of exchange, drawn by Fuller, Gardner, and Co., of Mobile, in
favour of Joseph B. Earle, upon Fuller and Yost, of New Orleans,
for five thousand two hundred and 'ten dollars, protested for nonpayment. The action was against the endorser of the bill, which
had been purchased at Mobile by an agent of the plaintiffs, who had
funds 'in his'hands belonging, to the plaintiffs, for the purpose, of
purchasing bills exchange, as- a means of remittance to New Orleans.
The Circuit Court gave judgment, for the defendant.
The case of the Bank of Augusta was arg#ed by Mr. D. B. Ogden, for the plaintiffs, and by Mr. C. J. Ingersoll, for the defendant.
Mr. Ogden also submitted the case' of the New Orleans and"Carollton Railroad Company to the Court, on the argument in, the case
9f the Bank of Aigusta; &c. The case, of the Bank of the iited
fttes vs.'Primrose, was argued by Mr. Sergeant and. Mr.Wobsterg

JANUARY TERM, 1829.

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

for the plaintiff in error, and by Mr. C. J. Ingersoll, and Mr. Vande
Gr'uff, for Joseph B. Earle. A printed argument for W. D. Primrose,
was also submitted by Mr. Crawford.
Mr. Ogden; for the Bank of Augusta, contended that the banxc
had a right to- become the purchaser of the bill of exchange on
which the suit was brought; and they had a legal right.to recover its
amount against the defendant, as the endorser of the bill.
The plaintiffs were the owners of a bill or bills of exchange,
which-they had purchased at Augusta, in Georgia, drawn on persons in Mobile, which were remitted by them to Mobile, and were
there paid. The funds thus obtained, were invested in the bill of
exchange which is the subject of this suit, for the purpose of a remittance. The question for the determination of this Court is, whether
the plaintiff's had authority to make the purchase. The Circuit
Court of Alabama decided this to be contrary to the laws of Alabama.
If the decision of the Circuit Court shall be sustained by this
Court, a deeper wound will be inflicted on the commercial businbss
of the United States than it has ever sustained. The prinicipal
means by which the commercial dealing between the states of the
United States and Alabama is conducted, will be at an end; and
there will be no longer the facilities of intercourse for the purposes
of traffic, by which alone it is prosperous and beneficial. Nor -will
the effect of such a decision be confined to the Atate of Alabama.
The principles of law which forbid the dealing in exchange by a
corporation established under the laws of another state, and by the
terms of its charter expressly authorised to' purchase bills of exchange, will prevail to the full extent of inhibiting the same purchases in other states ; and thus exclude the principal operations of
commerce between the states of the Union. In the state of Alabama,'such a condition of things will operate most injuriously. The
purchases of bilts of exchange in that state, are extensively made
by the agents of corpdrations of other states ; and thus, by the competition which is produced; the rates of exchange are kept in a due,
proportion to those of other states. The large 'productions of cotton
in that state, are thus enabled to realize to the planter a proper, and
an equal price to that obtained by the planters in the neighbouring
states. Should the banks of Alabama and the capitalists of that
state have the exclusive right to deal in exchange, the effect of such
a monopoly will be felt extensively.
Such operations in exchange as those out of which this controversy has arisen, have been transacted in every state of the Union.
Until now, their legality has never be6n doubted; and in rio Court
of the United States, or in any'state Court, has their validity been
before qnestioned or denied. The Union has existed for more than
half a century, the transactions between the states composing it, of
the same character with that which is now before the Court, have,
for a large portion of that period, been extensive and constant; and
they have been universally found to be beneficial,. No state, what

524

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank df Au usta vs, Earle.]

ever the power of its legislature may be to act upon the matter; a
power which it is not intended to admit or deny in this argument;
has attempted to interpose a prohibition and forbid such dealing.
The proposition in the Circuit Court, and on which its decision is
fou4ed, is that a corporation of one state can do no, commercial
business, can make no contract, and can do. nothing in any other
state of the Union, but in that in which, by the law of the state, it
has been created.
This proposition is the more injurious, as in the United States associated capital is essentially necessary to the operations of commerce, and the creation and improvement of the facilities of intercourse, which can only be accomplished by large means. Associated
capital here, sup'plies the place of the large individual accumulations
which are found in Europe.
The question is not on the powers of a corporation, but as to
whom and to what objects those powers can be exerted. A corporation 'is the creature of the law, and it is clothed, with all the
powers of a person. The position on the other side is, that when
it leaves the state which gave it existence by granting its charter, it
loses its personal existence, and has n6 existence whatever. This
is a harsh doctrine, and seems at war with the principles of those
who assert and maintain state rights. It is certainly true that a
corporation in one state, is not a corporation in another state, as to
the full exercise of corporate powers. In Georgia, if it was brought
into being by a law of that state, it may carry on any business authorized by its charter; but in Alabama it can do nothing but what
the laws of Alabama authorize it to do, as a corporation, or which
these laws do not forbid. It may institute suits in Alabama. If a
debt is contracted in Augusta, in Georgii, and the debtor removes 'to
Mobile, can no suit be instituted to recover the debt in Mobile? It
can be sued at Alabama, as it may sue.
Congress in 1825 passed an act auth6rizing steamboat companies
to own ships and vessels, and to take out a register on the oath ofthe
president of the company. Suppose a steamboat owned and registered in New York shall put into Mobile, and shall there be unlawfully taken possession of; could no action be brought by the company for such a trespass? Could not the company make an
agreement to have the boat repaired in Mobile ? Is it possible that
such a construction can be given to the law ?
Nothing is better settled than that a corporation may institute
suits in the Courts of other states and countries than those under
whose laws they may have been established. 1 Roll's Abridg. 531.

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.)

Court of Alabama to be correct, that by the laws of nations, corporations of other countries may'institute suits out of the states or
countries in which they were created: but it is said this principle
and established practice does not apply to suits which are claidid
-to be instituted by a corporation of one state of the United'States, in
the Courts of another state ; that the states are not nations towards
each other, and that the rules and principles of international law do
not apply to them; that all the states compose one nation, and each
is absorbed in the nation of the United States.
This is a strange doctrine as to the states of the Union. The
same governments, having similar laws, are said to owe to each
oiher less comity than is admitted to be due to foreign nations. The
contrary to this position would seem just and proper. Between the
states comity is doubly due; and is an obligation of the highest
influence.
The states between each other are sovereign and independent.
They are distinct and separate sovereignties, except so far as theyhave parted with some of the, attributes of sovereignty by the Constitution. 'They continue to be nations, with all their rights, and
under all their national obligations, and with all the rights of nations
in every particular; except in the surrender by each to the common
purposes and objects of the Union, under the Constitution. The
rights of each state, when not so yielded up, remain absolute.
Cbngress have never provided for th6 proof of the laws of the
states when they are brought forward in the Courts of tle United
States, or inthe Courts of the states; and they are proved as foreign
laws are proyed. There must be special legislation of every state
as to the mode of proof of the laws oP other states. New York has
legislated on this subject, and a provision has been made which is
applicable to it.
Every -principle of law which allows foreign states to sue in the
Courts of other countries, applies to corporations. The laws respecting mortgages are necessarily local in their character and provisions;
and yet it has been held that a corporation of one state may become
a mortgagee of lands in another state. This was decided by Chancellor Kent, in the case of The Silver Lake Bank, 4 Johns. Ch. Rep.
370. In this case the Chancellor held that corporations created by
the legislature of Pennsylvania had a right to enforce a mortgage
on real property in New York, by a proceeding in'the Court of
Chancery of New York.
It is said that a right to sue and a right to contract are different;
that a corporation may sue because it is. a person recognised by the
laws of Alabama, and may take a stand as a person in the Courts
of Alabama. Thus a corporation of Georgia is considered a person
in Alabama. It can give a warrant of attorney; for no suit can be
sustained without such a warrant. Why is such a right allowed?
It is because a corporation is recognised as having a personal existence. How can they sue to enforce a contract, and not have a
right to make a contract? In principle there can be no difference.

SUPREME COURT
[Bank of Augmata ts. Earle.]

Does not a right to sue give a right to make a compromise of the
matter in controversy in the suit? This is a right to make a contract, for a compromise is a contract. He who institutes a suit may
discontinue it. This is a contract. The declaration in a suit in a,
Court of Alabama, must aver that the contract was made in Alabama; but this is not traversable.
A chose -in action is assignable only to a limited extent; but it
has been held that the-assignees appointed under the bankrupt laws
of England may sue in the Courts of the United States. This is
giving -an extra-territorial existence to the laws of England. This
is :on the principles of the comity of nations; and such principles are
essenti4l to sustain the intercourse between nations. But if no express coyltract can be made in anothed state by a corporation, it cannot be a party to an implied contract. The law will not suffer a
cqltract to be implied, where no express contract can be made.
Look at what this would lead to. The Bank of Augusta may buy
a bill on Mobile, and the bill may be sent by the bank to Mobile for
collection. It may be paid in Mobile to the agent of the bank; but
if a corporation cannot make a contract, no implied promise of the
agent to remit the money collected to the Bank of Augusta can be
raised; and he may keep the. whole amount. Suppose a note given
by him to the bank for the money, it would be, Void. The doctrine
is monstrous.
The Constitution of the United States was formned to establish a
national government, and this Court is a most important part of the
government thus formed. The great object of the Constitution was
to erect .a government for commercial purposes, for mutual intercourse, and mutual dealing. The prosperity of every state could
alone be promoted and secured by establishing these on principles
of reciprocity; and On the security and protection of the citizens of
each state, in all the states united by the government. This Court
will hesitate a lcng time before it will make a decision which will
either break down or cripple the whole of the commercial intercourse between the states, and shake the foundations of all our internal 'commerce.
One of the most important objects and interests for the preservation of the Union is the establishment of railroads. Cannot the railroad corporations of New York, Pennsylvania, or Maryland, make
a contract out of the state 'for materials for the construction of a railroad? Cannot these companies procure machinery to use on their
railroads, in another state. They.cannot get on without this right.
These railroads often run into other states, with the permission of
"those states; and it never has been doubted that every contract for
construction made by the corporations to which the railroads belong,
although out of the state in which they were originally created, is
valid.
Manufacturing corporations established in one state by the law
of the state cannot sue in another state for debts due for articles
maade by such corporation, if the decision of the Circuit Court of

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

Alabama is sustained by this Court. Policies'of insurance made in
another state. than that in which the property insured was, at the
time of the insurance, will be void.
The legislature of New.York have by a special law prohibited
insurances against fire being made in New York'by foreign corporations. This shows that the legislature thought that without such
a law foreign corporations had'a right to make such insurances, and
to sue upon contracts made in New York, or contracts flowing out
of policies of insurance.
March 1sth, 1814

Revised Laws of New York, 52.

Act of

It is admitted that a corporation may not carry on the busines§
for which it was created, out of the state whose laws gave it existence. But this does not interfere with the' right claimed by the
plaintiffs in this case. The Bank of Augusta cannot carry on the
business of banking in Alabama, for by the laws of Alabama this is
forbidden. But if not forbidden by the law of that state, itcould
transact the business of banking there. At common law every man
has a right to become a banker, and to carry on the business of
banking. IThe acts of Parliament in England impose restrictions on.
this common lavW right.

15 Johns. Rep. 379.

The plaintiffs in this case are .citizens of the state'of Georgia.
They are so called in the writ by which the suit was commenced;
and by the Constitution of the United States they have a right to

transact any business which, any persons, citizens of the'state of
Alabama, may carry on, and which is not prohibited by the laws!
of'the state. The law of New" York authorize special partnerships.
Have not-these partnerships a right to deal in Georgia and Alabama
to the same extent and in the same manner as in New York ? This;
shows that an association under the name of one person, can do any
and all acts -vhich citizens of New York or of any other state
can do.
Large collections have been made by the Bank of England in
the United States, on bills of exchange drawn in the United States,
and returned protested for non-paymefit. There has not been az
suggestion that the Bank of England, a'foreign corpdration, could
not pursue such claims in the Courts of the states and of the United
States, in the same manner as individuals. All those bills have
been collected but a very small amount , and this after many of theiriz
had been put inf suit. Large and numerous sales of the stocks of
states of the United States, and of corporations established by states,
have been made in other states; and in England. These would be
voidon the same principle as that claimed on the part of the defendant in this case. Alabama has herself issued stock as the basis of
her banking capital; and this stock has been sold out of the state of
Alabama. Yet she will not be bound to pay the amount of this
stock, or even to pay the interest on it, if as a corporation she can-not contract out of her territories.
Mr. Ogden' went into an examination of the cases which had
been referred to by the Circuit Court of Alabama, and which were

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

considered by that Court, as sustaining the principle that the plaintiffs
i error 6ould not maintain this suit. He examined particularly
the.case of I-lead and Arnory vs.-the Providence Insurance Company, 2 Cranch, 127. The Dartmouth College case, 4 Wheat, 519.
Goslen vs. the Corporation of Georgetown, 6 Wheat. 593. The
Bank of the United States vs. Donelly, 8 Peters, 361.
There is another class of cases and authorities cited in the opinion
of the Circuit Court of Alabama, which go to show that a corporation has no power which is not given to it by the law which creat6d
it, and from which all its functions are derived. lit is not necessary
to examine these authorities, because the principle laid down by the
Circuit Court is fully admitted; and because in this case, it is not a
question as to the powers of the coriporation, but as to the place
where those powers may be executed.
There is another view upon this branch of the argument, which
appears worthy of the serious consideration of this Court. This is
a-i action commenced in the Circuit Court of the United States.
How does the Court acquire jurisdiction of the cause? Certainly
not under the state law of Georgia, constituting the plaintiffs a corporation. A state legislature has no power to give to or take away
jurisdiction from the Courts of the United States.
Again, as it regards the United States, and the Courts of the
United States, a corporation created by one of the states is as much
a foreign corporation as a corporation created by Georgia is a foreign
corporation in Alabama, created by a different government, with
different powers and different local jurisdiction.
How does the Court of the United States acquire its jurisdiction
in this case? From the Constitution, and the laws of Congress
passed under the Constitution. Now the Constitution gives the
Courts of the United States no jurisdiction where a corporation
created by a state is a party, and a citizen Of an6ther state is the
other party; but it does give the Courts of the United States jurisdiction in all cases between citizens of different states.
In the case of The Hope Insurance Company vs. Boardman, this
Court 'many years ago decided that the Courts of the United States
had no jurisdiction in cases where a state corporation was a. party;
but the plaintiff must aver, in order to give the Court jurisdiction,
that the stockholders" and persons interested in and composing the
corporation were citizens of one state, and the defendant 4 citizen
of another state. And the practice has been uniform ever since, to
make such an averment in order to bring the case within the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States.
This averment is material, and its truth must be proved if put
in issue by a plea in abatement. It is manifest then that the Circuit'
Court had jurisdiction in this case; because it appeared on the record
that the plaintiffs, or the persons interested as plaintiffs, were citizens
of Georgia, and the defendant was a citizen of Alabama.
And when the Courts of the United States sustain an action in
the 'name of a state corporation, it is only because citizens of the

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

state have associated together under the name and in the form of a
corporation. Still it is those citizens only who are the parties before
the Court, and not the corporatiodi, quasi corporation. Upon no
other hypothesis can the Courts of the United States have any jurisdiction in the cause, none other being justified or authorized by the
Constitution.
Now it is asked of this Court, if citizens of the state of Georgia
have a right to sue in the Courts of the United States in the state
of Alabama, under the name of an association called the Bank of,
Augusta; does not this amount to a recognition on the part of the
Courts of the United States of their rights to act Under that associated
name? And if they may act under that name in one thing, why
not in all things? .If you recognise their right of acting in bringing
a suit to enforce a contract, why not in making the contract itself,
which is the foundation of the suit ? In principle there is seen no
difference. Twenty merchants in Augusta, in Georgia, may be
concerned as partners in carrying on business, in the name of one.
of them, or they mnay assume any other name. Can it be contended
for a moment that under that assumed name, they would not have
a right to make Contracts, purchase cotton, bills of exchange, or do
any other business not forbidden by the laws of Alabama? If'this
is-not so; what becomes of the provision inthe Constitution of the
United States, which declares that a citizen of one state shall be
.entitled to all tle rights of a citizen of the other states ?
It is no answer to this to say, that in an action in such a case.
you must bring the suit in the names of all the partners. This is a
question as to the remedy; but it can in no wise affect the power of
contracting, or-of suing.' One is a matter of form, the other is matter of substance.
There remains another point in the case to which the attention
of the Court is respectfully called. By the constitution of Alabama
it is declared that there shall be established a bank, to be called
"The Bank of the State of Alabama;" and that the legislature may
that bank,
from time to time establish as many branches of think
proper.to -be
' rhy
located in different parts of the state, as they
This constitutional provision has been construed as a prohibition
on the legislature, which precludes them from establishing any other
bank in the state ; and upon the argument of this cause, it is presumed that it must be taken for granted that the construction given
to the constitution in this particular, is the true construction.
A large portion of the stock of the bank and of its branches is
reserved for the state; intending, no doubt, thereby to acquire a
revenue for the state by means of their interest in the bank. Now
it is supposed, that to permit a bank of Georgia, or of any other state,
to transact its business in Alabama, would interfere with the profits
of the Bank of Alabama; and would therefore be in direct opposition to the settled policy of the state, as declared and established by
the constitution.
Let us, examine this argument. It is readily admitted, for the
67

(Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

purposes of this case, that the state of Alabama has a right to pass
a law declaring that no bank shall exist and do its business in that
state, unless it be chartered by the legislature of the state. This is
an admission as broad as can be called for: but it by no means follows that the transaction which is the subject of the present controversy is an illegal one.
What is legitimate banking business? It consists of three things.
Second, receiving money on deposit.
First, discounting notes
Third. issuing notes or bills, to be circulated as money. It seems
to be clear and certain that all these operations must'be combined
to constitute banking, as understood among us, and in the commercial world.
The mere discounting notes is not of itself a banking operation.
It is indeed doing one thing which banks are authorized to do, but
it is not therefore banking. May not a merchant discount his own
notes, without being considered a banker? The mere receiving
money on deposit, to be paid out again whenever called for, is not
banking Surely a man may deposit his funds in safe keeping in
the hands of a friend, without making that friend what is known in
our livr and in the commercial law, as a banker. Issuing a note to
be put into circulation as money may, perhaps, be evidence of itself
of an act of banking; and this may be the most. important power
which a bank possesses.
Now there is no pretence that the Bank of Augusta received
deposits in Alabama. It is not pretended that the Bank of Augusta
ever put into circulation in Alabama one of its notes or bills to be
circulated as money in that state : and it is contended, that if they
had discounted a promissory note in Alabama, it would not of itself
have been such a banking operation as would render the transaction
illegal, if there were a law in Alabama absolutely prohibiting any
bank but the bank of the state from carrying on the banking business- in the state. An individual might- discount a note without
violating the law, and so might the plaintiffs in error.
It isadmitted that under a.-charter given by the state of Georgia,
the plaintiffs could not establish a bank in the state of Alabama. No
such right is claimed by the plaintiffs But it is contended that
becoming lawfully possessed of funds in the state of Alabama, com.mon sense, common justice, and common law require that the plaintiffs should have the ordinary mians of withdrawing those funds
from the state of Alabama. The purchase of a bill of exchange is
among the ordinary means of transmitting funds from one place to
another.
Again. The act :complained of is the purchase of bills of exchange. Now dealing in the purchase and sale of bills of exchange
is not banking. It is true the power of dealing in bills of exchange
is often expressly given to banking corporations: and the fact that
it is expressly given,is evidence of the general understanding that
without it isso given, a bank would not have the rigut or power of
dealing in exchange, and that is, strictly speaking, no part of the-

JANUARY TERM, 1-839.

531

(Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

ordinary business of a bank. Some banks have the power of making
a canal; and yet it is hardly to be contended that making canals is
a part of banking business. If therefore there be an express prohibition in the law and constitution of Alabama, prohibiting the
business of banking in that state by any other than their own incorporated banks, it would in no wise prohibit the plaintiffs from purchasing a bill of exchange in Alabama.
There remains yet another view of this question which it is thought
the duty of counsel to submit to the consideration of this Court. It
has heretofore been contended that the dealing in bills of exchange,
being no part of the business of banking, does not come within the
prohibitions of the constitution of Alabama against banking.
But let us now suppose that the legislature of Alabama had
passed a law prohibiting any body but one of their own incorporated
banks, from dealing in bills of exchange. This would present a
more important question. In the piesent state of the commercial
world, bills of exchange are one of the great means of carrying on
the commerce of the world.
Our commerce with the East Indies is principally carried on by
means of bills of exchange. These are now sent instead of specie
to China, to Batavia, and to Calcutta. By means of bills of exchange
our northern merchants are enabled to obtain funds in the south for
the purchase of the cotton and tobacco, the rich productions of that
portion of our country. ;By means of bills of exchange, the merchants of the south are enabled to purchase goods in the north. By
means of bills of exchange the manufacturers of the north are enabled to receive remittances from the south, for the carriages, shoes,
cabinet furniture, and numerous other articles shipped and sold
there.
It will not be said that no commerce can be carried on without
the use and facilities of bills of exchange;. but it is said, with emphasis, that without their use'it would be a cramped, and crippled,
and an unproductive commerce. Our ships would be almost useless,
and the trade and intercourse between the states would be prostrate.
Now by the Constitution of the United States, power is given to,
Congress to regulate couime-- with foreign nations, and among the
states.
This power to regulate commerce necessarily includes in it the
power to regulate the means by which commerce is to be carried on..
Hence 'the laws relative to ships or vessels. No express power i,
given over them by the Constitution, but they are the great means bywhich commerce is carried on, and therefore Congress, having the
power to regulate commerce, has exercised the power of regulating
them.
It is submitted that the legislature of Alabama has as much right
to declare that no. ship or vessel shall come into the ports of that
state, Which does not belong to one of her own citizens, and is not
registerpd in some office established by a law of Alabama, as she
has to prohibit any but her own citizens from dealing in exchange

,,ergeant for the United States Bank.
Thecase stated admits the right of the plaintiffs to sue in Alabarna, and in the Circuit Court for that district. It admits the right
to recover a judgment in sucl-suit. It admits the right of the plaintiffs, therefore, to be, to apea ,and to act as a corporation under its
charter in Alabama. This concession, approved and sanctioned as
it is by the judgment of the Court, would seem to make it unnecessary to consider the question whether a foreign corporation can sue
in Alabama; unless it be deemed ,doubtful in this Court, where it is
perhaps open upon the record, notwithstanding the concession. If
thought necessary, it will accordingly be considered.,
But, first in order, it is proposed to consider the question directly
presented, being the one decided by the Circuit Court, which is thus
stated in the record: "Whether the purchase of the said bill of exchange by the plaintiffs Eks
aforesaid, was a valid contract under the
laws of Alabama."
Before proceeding to the general question here presented, it is
right to give some attention to the nature and state of the transaction as embraced in the words "as aforesaid;" in order to exhibit
one view of the case of itself sufficient for its decision.
It is necessavy only to premise, for this purpose, that the bank
was authorized by its charter to purchase and to hold bills of exchange, without restriction of time or place; that the defendant had
a right by law to sell the bill of exchange; and that the contract of
sale was executed and at an end. It was no longer executory.
The suit is not upon the contract of sale, norfto enforce that contract.
It is upon the bill sold, against the defendant as endorser, and upon
his contract as endorser.
How does that contract arise ? It consists of two parts, the endorsement, and the delivery- of the bill endorsed. Neither alone
would create a liability, and neither alone makes a contract as endorser. The endorsement by itself ik.akes no contract with anybody,
either 'to pass the bill or to create the liability. It is the delivery
which effects both these ends. The ordinary form of the declaration
proves this, The settled law of bills and notes establishes it. The
parties on the bill make a new contract with every successive
holder by the delivery. This is the law as to bills and notes payable to bearer. It is equally so. as to endorsed bills. The delivery
makes the contract. The time and place of endorsement, material
for some purposes, arewholly immaterial for this. Whenever and
wherever the name may have been written, the delivery gives it
effect, whether it be to pass the bill merely, or to pass it with a
liability on the part of the endorsee.
The question then is, where was--the'delivery made?, This is a

JANUARY TERM 1839.

533r

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.)

question of legal construction, and not a mere matter of fact. Suppose the transaction to have been, carried on by means of correspondence, where would the delivery be considered in law to have
been made? The bill being endorsed by the one party, and the full
consideration paid by the other, it must surely be construed to have
been made where the party is capable of receiving it. Nothing less
than this would be giving the stipulated equivalent. It is indispensable to the justice ef the case, and according to the intention of
the parties. Upon any construction but this, the one party woud
get' the money of the other without a consideration. An interpretation leading to such a conclusion would be a disgrace to the law.
Both parties must be supposed to intend what is fair and, in good
faith.
Does it make any difference that the transaction is conducted by
means of an agent, and not by written correspondence? There is
no reason why it should. Persons who are distant from each other
can only treat through intermediaries ; .and it is of no consequence
what they are. The agent acts under instructions, which are his
contract, and the essence of that contract is to obtain a lawful and
valid delivery.
But it is superfluous to argue in favour of a position already established by the highest jidicial authority in the. land. Cox and Dick
vs. United States, 6 Peters, 172. 202. Duncan vs. United States, 7
Peters, 435. 449.

The delivery then in 'contemplation of law was at the bank.
That delivery passed the bill to the bank, with all the rights accruing by it against the parties.
But it may be alleged that admitting all this to be so, the contract created by delivery of the bill is affected by the illegality of the
original contract of purchase, so as to render the endorsement also
illegal. To this there are several answers. In the firs 51a 'A the
original contract was executed and at an end by delivery of the
thing bargained for. Can what was so delirered be recovered back?
The full consideration has been paid. There is no offer to refund
it: and there is nothing immoral in the transaction.
Again: the very reverse of the allegation is the truth. This construction makes the original contract good and valid, by making its
end and object lawful. In legal intendment it transfers the whole
contract to Philadelphia, as the place of performance. If the Jelivery was ti be made there, the contract arising from that delivery
was also there. For this purpose it is not material where the money
was paid ;it is not material where the endorger's name was written
on the bill. The place of endorsement may fix the measure of lia.
bility in case of dishonourof the bill. The delivery makes the contract with the particular holder. This must especially be the case
where 'an agent is employed. His authority is to make a lawful
and valid purchase. le must do it in a lawful mode; andAn favour
of justice.he, will be intended to have done so.

Still further: it cannot be admitted that even the alleged illegality
is of such a character as to defeat the claim upon the bill. To produce that result there must be a clear prohibition by statute, or by
the common law; or a'penalty which implies a prohibition. See
the cases collected in Wheeler vs.. Russell, 17 Mass. 258. In the
case now under consideration there is no such prohibition. There is
at most an infirmity in the contract of sale, from the want of capacity to make the purchase. Admit, for the purpose of this argument,
that the contract of sale could not have been enforced at law by the
buyer; it does not follow that the execution of the contract is illegal,
still less that it is criminal. The bill was good before the contract.
,It is good after the contract. If it had been made expressly to be
negotiated to a bank out of the state, that would not aftect its
validity; even though the policy of the state were against foreign
banks carrying on business within its limits. Reese vs. Conococheague Bank, .5 Rand. 326.
If this be so, the more general question does not arise. At all
events, it will however receive some light from the view which has
been taken. I will now proceed to consider'it.
That question is, whether the Bank of the United States can lawfully become the holder of a bill of exchange by putr, hase in Alabama.
The general ground taken against the bank is, that no corporation
can make such purchase, or enter into any contract out of the state
in which it is chartered. A vastly important position this must be
admitted to be. Its bearing is very extensive. For, observe some
of its effects.
1. It will follow as an unavoidable consequence, that no corporation can buy a bill of exchange at all; unless, which rarely happens,
it be strictly a domestic bill, that is, wholly within, a state. There
must be different parties on the bill at different places. Each makes
a new contract with the holder, -and each contract has its own locality. If a corporation be incapable of contracting out of the state
where it is chartered, it cannot be the holder of such a bill. Nor is
this all. No title can be deiv6d through a corporation.
,. This doctrine once introduced into the law, as a principle, no
one can foresee the extent of its operation. It must apply to all
contracts whatever, express or implied, primary or secondary, avoiding them all. Itmust apply to them according to some legal determined method of fixing the locality. What that is, is a construction
of law upon the facts. Is this construction to continue as heretofore,
or will a new set of principles become necessary ? If they continue,
the contract, otherwise moral and just, may be made void by construction of law.
a. It would operate suddenly and without notice to condemn a
long established usage and practice, universally understodd, adopted,
and approved. It operates upon the past and the present, as well as
the future, so as to avoid all existing contracts to an extent which
can neither be l1mited nor def1ned. The method of proceeding by

JANUARY TERM, 1839.
[Baik of Augusta vs. Earle.)

legislation is very different. It acts prospectively. It acts with precision, and with-due limitation arid exception. its action is restricted
to the sphere of legislative power, leaving each state free to pursue
its own policy within the -limits of its constitutional power; and
leaving in rightful force all that is not prohibited. But -a principle
like that contended for, judicially established, sweeps over all the
states, and embraces all cases whatsoever, even such as the true
policy of the state may require should be supported.
Partial legislation, forbidding certain acts of foreign corporations,
has been adopted in many of the states; for example, in Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia. Whether such acts be within the
constitutional competency of the state legislatures or not, yet it is
most clear that they all assume as' their basis the general power of
corporations to contract where there is no statutory prohibition, the
continuance, of that power except in the prohibited cases, and its
unlimited existence where it has not been curtailed or restricted.
There cannot possibly be higher or stronger proof of the law, the,
universal law, than this is. It is the most authoritative and conclusive evidence. To such acts, when duly passed, the common law
lends its aid to give them effect. What they prohibit, the law will
in no manner aid to support, but the contrary.
Having stated these preliminary objections, we now come to the
very question--Does the law of Alabama prohibit a corporation
chartered in another state from buying a bill of exchange in
Alabama? Does it, in other words, proibit such a corporation
from making a cont act? The broad ground is here taken.
What, then, ret uis inquire, is the law of Alabama ? Of what does
it consist? It is made up of'the conmon law, the'constitution and
statutes of the state, and the Constitution and statutes of the United
States where they are applicable.
The common law is regularly derived to it, and is coeval with its
existence. In Prince's Dig. Laws of Georgia, 551, is a declaration
of the boundaries of the state of Georgia, the same as admitted for
the United States by the treaty of peace with England: sec. 23. 119.
In page 552 is the authority to sell to the United States a part, comprehending the present states of Alabama and Mississippi: sec. 23.
This part was accordingly ceded, and the consideration, received:
526. Thus ceded it retained its former laws till altered. What was
that law? The common law had been adopted by the state of
Georgia, by express statutory enactment, on the 25th February,
1784. Prince, 310, sec. 1. This is sufficient. But, further, the fifth
section of the articles of cession, Prince, 527, refers to the ordinance
of 13th January, 1787, for the government of the western territory,
of the United States, which provides for the common law. 1 Laws

seems a quaint one, but it is true to the sense. Right is antecedent
to all law. The object of law is to secure right; not so much to
define'as to enforce it, and to prevent wrong. When we speak of
what is malum in se, w6, have, an accurate and explicable meaning.
We say at once that it is against law, referring to a standard to
which all laws must be supposed to conform. So of the obligation
of promises, and the like, derived from a source above the law, It
is this common law, which in every state and nation protects and
secures' the great body of our rights, and enforces obligations founded
in morality. In all civilized nations, this law is substantially the
same. Even in nations not admitted to be within that description,
there is a strong resemblance : for example, in the laws ofIthe Hin.doos. The reason is obvious. Whether expounded in codes, or
disclosed by judicial investigation and decision, the great principles
of iustice are identical; and it is the aim of all law to cultivate, extend, and enforce them. Statutes are but few in comparison. They
are exceptions; the common law is the great body. The legislator
acts chiefly"upon matters which are indifferent.
Constitutions of states are frames of government. They give no
civil rights. The utmost they aim at, in this respect, is to secure
some of the most important of them, (as existing things,) by a solemn
assertion of them, by excepting thQm from the encroachments of
power, or by placing around them strong and -permanent guards.
This is the proper office of a bill of rights. In all forms of government, these rights are the same; however they may be trodden
down in arbitrary ones, where there is no independent judiciary to
protect them. The common law acknowledges and aids them.
Of this common law, the law of nations is a part, and the law
merchant is a part, as binding and obligatory upon Courts of justice,
and upon individuIs, as any other part of.the common law. Surely,
it cannot be necessary to quote authority for this. It is self-evident.
It must be so, for the rights and interests 6f individuals are concerned in the law of nations; they depend upon it. No body of municipal law\ would be complete without it; unless the whole transactions
of a community were conlined within its limits, and the people
never went abroad. It furnishes the only rule of decision in a vast
variety of cases; there would be no rule without it. It is the
common law of nations, that is,.of all the inhabitants of the civilized wprld. It is said, with -great propriety, to be the law of nature applied to nations; the unwritten law, founded upon rights.
Take, for example, one of the most simple of its elements: the
owner of property going abroad with it, is the owner still If taken
from him by force or by fraud, he is robbed of it. When the wrong
is done by individuals, under the law of nations, he is entitled to
redress. When by a state or nation, his own nation vompels reparation to'be made. This law is thus the rule-of decision for individuals, and, between individuals, the only rule. What a sovereign
may do, is another question. He is responsible as a sovereign, if he
do wrong. But between individuals, it is the only rtlQ of decision,

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]
"The principle of international law on the subject of co-existing
commissions on the estate of a bankrupt, in concurrent operation in
different countries, is a rule of decision, not a question of jurisdiction, and does not affect the right of territorial sovereignty." Holmes
vs. Remsen<4 Johns. C. C. 466. S. C. 20 Ibid. 229. Where this
rule is properly applicable, it is, for all judicial purposes, a part of
the law of lhe land-it is the law of the land. Every judge is
bound to administer it as the law of the case. He can no more disregard or disobey it, than any other part of the law. It is "common right," the right of every suitor.
May not this rule, it will be asked, be controlled by the sovereign
lawgiving power? Admit that it may-that if a statute be so
made as to prohibit what the law of nations permits, the statute
must be obeyed. The common law cannot do this: there is an evident contradiction, for the common law cannot repeal or overrule
itself. The judge cannot do it, for he is to administer the law, and
this is the law: No general notions of policy or impolicy can effect
such an end; and for this plain reason, that there are considerations
to be entertained by the sovereign power. To that power, the responsibility belongs. The state or nation is answerable. Up6n this
ground our claims on foreign nations have rested, that they have
disregarded the law of nations. Upon this ground they have been
acknowledged and paid.
To the generality of the proposition, namely, that the law of nations is a part of the common law, or law of the land, there is no
exception. Every chapter and section of the law of nations is embraced by it; it is true of the whole, and it is true of every part,
no matter what its fouqdation. If there be a title of comity, as
there certainly is, still it is a title of the law of nations ; and therefore a title of the common law, as binding in the administration of
justice as any other part. The name, whatever it may seem to
the ear to import, does not detract from its obligatory force. The
lawmaking power may have authority over it, as it has over the
common law. But, in the absence of a statute plainly to the contrary, if a case arise, within the law of nations, that is the law to
be applied to it in judgment.
No nation has ever more implicitly acknowledged this truth than
the United States. The constitution of our Courts is such as to secure
an inflexible administration of justice to foreigners as well as to our
own citizens. No bending to the winds of occasional doctrine.
Steady, erect, and independent, they have no guide and no teacher
but the law. Even our Courts of admiralty-a d6scription of
Courts elsewhere too subject to extraneoxr influence-have here
been furnished with no direction but the la .'
No nation has had more occasion to insist upon the vigorous ap
plication of the law of nations. We have felt, as every nation similarly circumstanced must feel, that a large portion of the justice due
to our fellow-citizens is to be obtained, only by means of the law of
68

[Bank 6f Augusta vs. Earle.]

nations; and we acknowledge it, not only for its justice, but that we
may have the benefit of its provisions. It is a feeble exhibition of
its virtue to speak only of its regulating the intercourse of nations.
Its operation is upon individuals, and Vpon individual rights.
The position that the law of nations is part and parcel of the
common law, is supported by the highest and most venerable authority. Indeed, it has never been questioned, and more especially
the law merchant. 1 Black. Corn. 273. 4 Ibid. 67. Magna Charta,
ch. 30, contains an express provision in favour of merchant strangers; which occasioned the striking remark of r4Iontesquieu, 1. 20,
ch. 14, that the English have made the protection of foreign merchants, one of the articles of their own liberty. In Triquet vs. Bath,
3 Burr. 1480,'1481. Lord Mansfield quotes Lord Talbot as declaring
a clear opinion, "That the law of nations, in its full extent, was
part of the law of England."-" That the law of nations was to
be collected from the practice of different nations, and the authority
He quotes Lord Hardwicke to the same effect, and
of writers."
Lord Holt. Four names being thus associated, either of them alone
sufficient to establish a point; and, collectively, making a weight of
authority, only surpassed by the splendour of such an assemblage
of luminaries. In Respublica vs. Longchamps, 1 DalI. 111, a criminal case, the indictment was upon the law of nations. M'Kean,
Chief Justice, a very learned lawyer, and a very eminent man,
says, "The laws of nations form a a part of the municipal laws of
Penisylvania."---" This law, in its full extent, is part of the law of
this state, and is to be collected from the practice of different nations, and the authority of writers."
But why accumulate authorities upon a point which is every day
adopted, acted upon, and confessed? The occasions for its application are of daily occurrence, and its application is daily madesometimes unconsciously, I admit---by every tribunal in the land,
from the hizhest to the lowest. Why take up time in insisting upon
what is so manifest, so universally conceded ? Manifest and conceded though it be, yet there is not always a full sense of its force
and authority. This makes it necessary to say, as the truth really
is, that the authority of the law of nations is exactly the same as
that of the common law-it is as binding in matters of judicatureit is imperative and of absolute power. Its principles being known,
can no mcre be set aside, evaded, or disregarded, than a settled principle of the common law. Call it comity: still it is law, and part
of the rights of individuals, who are wronged if it be denied to
them.
This law is a part of the law of Alabama towards foreign nations.
Its authority towards the states of this Union is even greater.
They are united by an association at once national and federal. To
their national character belongs the faculty of regulating all their
commerce, of cultivating its growth, and improving and strengthening the commercial intercourse between the different parts of the
nation. The spirit of such an association, which aims at -an iati-

JANUARY TERM, ig3g.

539

[Bank of Augusta v8. Earle.]

mate, and easy, and equal intercourse, demands that whatever there
is of comity between nations, or by the practice of nations, should
be enlarged among the associates. More especially is this true, as
the care of commerce is intrusted to the government of the whole;
as a common concern, affecting the general welfare. If by the practice of these states, under the influence of this spirit of the Constitution of the United States, there were to be an enlarged.comity; it
would become among them an enlargement of that bianch of the
law of nations, of full authority. That practice is inquirable into,
(for no formal convention is necessary,) and, if ascertained, has the
effect of law. This does not at all detract from the sovereignty of
the states. On the contrary, it is the work of sovereign power attesting its existence. If it has been the universal practice to acknowledge each others' charters of incorporation, in contracts, that would
make the law; even though (which is by no means the case) it were
not so among independent nations. Of such a practice, some of the
evidences will hereafter be adverted to, not as necessary, but because
they may be useful. Certainly there can be no good reason for
frowning upon, or seeking to destroy a practice, which is in harmony with the spirit of the Constitution; tends to thd growth of commerce; and has a kindlv influence upon the intercourse of brethren
of one ftmily.
Is this in any manner derogatory, or can it be prejudicial to the
sovereignty or to the policy of the states? We have heard it argued that laws have no extra-territorial force, and many authorities
cited to maintain the position. Properly understood, it is as true as
it is familiar. The meaning is, that, proprio vigore, they have no
such power: that is, they have'nohe by virtue of any authority in
the lawgiver. He cannot make a law to govern in another territory. It is because this is so, that a law of nations is -necessary;
founded in mutual convenience and in common consent, to ascertain
a rule in individual cases. The comity of nations has furnished the
rule. It is not on this account the less a rule of binding force. Huberus says, "Every nation, from comity, admits that the laws of
each nation in force within its own territorial lirhits, ought to be in
force in all other nations, without injury to their respective powers
De Confl. Leg. 1. 1, tit. 3, § 2, p. 538. The proudest
and rights."
--nations have adopted this maxim. How, then, can its adoption be
derogatory to states closely confederated? Bit if at any time such
a practice, however, long continued, should be found derogatory, impolitic, or inconvenient, is the evil without a remedy? The lawmaking power is to apply the corrective.
And here we naturally recur to the other branch of the law of
Alabama, the statutory law, the exercise of the power of the lawmaking authority. Within the limits-of the Constitution, this is admitted to be plenary ; there is no other restriction. The legislature
is competent to decide-upon both points: the evil and the remedy.
Of the duty of the. Courts to respect the decision, when- clearly
made, there is no doubt. But that it belongs to the judiciary origi-

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of &ugusta v8. Earle.]

nally to deal with either, cannot be-assented to. The Courts are to
expound the laws, not to make them. They have mo faculties for
such an inquiry. There is still another objection. The will of the,
legislature, however pronounced, isY binding upon the judiciary.
Their enactment is a positive exercise of legislatiVe power. Their
refusal to enact, where they have- power, is equally significant of
their opinion. 'Either is the will of the community, whick is paramount. The legislature, too, can precisely adapt thi remedy to the
evil. Courts of justice cannot. They have no pQwer- to change
the law from what it has been. Here, then, is the saving of what
Huberus calls "their respective powers and rights." It is in the
sovereign lawmaking power, and not in the administration of the
law, that the saving authority is lodged.
Having thus established that the law of nations is part of the law
of Alabama, we come to these the only remaining inquiries:1. What is the law of the case, according to the laws of nations;
as they exist among independent nations, and by the practice of
these states ?
2. Is there any statute of Alabama which alters the law ?
1. But here we ake met by an objection 'which, if well founded,
puts the law of nations and the comity of nations entirely out of the
case. It is said they do not apply, because the states of this Union
are confederated and not independent states. (Opinion of the judge
of the Circuit Court.)
These states are at once confederated and independent states.
They are, to all intents and purposes, independent and sovereign,
except so far as they have, given up their powers to the Union.
"For all national purposes embraced by the federal Constitution,
the states and their citizens are one, united under one sovereign
authority. In all other respects the states are necessarily foreign
arid independent of each other." Bucknor vs. Finley, 2 Peters,
586. 590. Have Congress then the poeirr, and have they exercised
it, to supply the rule-in all cases, where between independent sovereignties it is furnished by the law .of nations; and where, from
some source, it is indispensably requisite that it should be supplied ?
Do the laws of the United States define the rights of the domicil in
cases of intestacy and succession? Do they decide what law shall
govern the Construction of contracts-? Do they tell us where a contract shall be deemed to have beerq made? Do they determine how
the capacity of parties shall be ascertained ? Do they provide how
the ages of majority, for different purposes, shall be determined?
Do they settle, or afford the means of settling, any one of the innumerable questions arising from the conflict of laws? The Constitution makes provision for the cases of fugitives from justice and
fugitives from labour, and that is all.
But, speaking historically, there was a time when these 'states
(then provinces) were entirely independent of each other. There
was a time, afterwards, when they were united by a very loose and
inadequate confederationi. What law governed -t'thoserepetivw

periods? yVherV and how has it been dltered? There has been
no alteration. 'Thexe is scircely a volume of-reports in this Union,
the reports of the decisions of this Court included, which has not
the title Foreign Laws and Foreign States; and does not embrace
under them these states afid their laws. 'There is not a digest, with
any pretengions to the character of completeness, but has such a
title. There is trot a case discussed, in which a 4uestion arises,
where the law of nations is not appealed to. The learned and most
useful work of Judge Story. upon the econflict of laws, applies it to
the states throughout. And this Court has decided, sanctioning
the judgment of the Circuit Court for the district of Pennsylvania,
Lonsdale vs. Brown, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 81, that a bill drawn in one
state upon another state, is a foreign bill. If this be an error, there
certainly never was another instance of one so pervading and deeply
rooted, and which so long escaped detection. We submit, however,
respectfully, but confidently, that it is not an error. A law among
these states, deciding those questions of continual occurrence which
fall under the title of comity of nations, is of indispensable necessity
much more important among themselves, than between any one of
them, and nations foreign to our Union. In propoxtion as intercoulnmunication becomes more rapid and easy, or, in other words,
as the great ends and objects of the Union are attained, it becomes
mord and ,more imyortant. Precisely because these states are .at
once confederated and independent, bechuse there is a union and
yet these .are sovereign states, we cannot dispense with a law,
which is in the spirit of union, but is essential to independent sovereignties. Comity is a sovereign attrihute. It would, indeed, be
very singular, if it were true, that a British corporation was entitled
to be acknowledged in our Courts, but a corporation of one of our
own states was not.
Assuming that the law of nations does apply between the states
of the Union; what is the rule of that law as applied to the present
question ?
The rights of a corporation, that is, its corporate rights, are all
conferred by its charter; are all of equal authority, and from the
same source of power. What are they? To have a corporate
name and style. To have a common seal. To have succession.
To sue and be sued by its corporate name. To be,by that name, a
person in law, capable of contrading. To make by-laws. The
power to transact business is not, properly speaking, granted by the
charter, but the rights of the associators, which they would have
individually or collectively, are restricted by it. The grant is limited
to the particular kind of business, whatever it may be, or other
kinds are expressly prohibited. In either case the body cannot
transcend these limits. Thus incorporated, the body becomes a
person ir law and is embraced by statutes which speak of persons,
as well in criminal as in civil proceedings. United States vs. Amedy,

SUPREME COURT
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

Maryfand, 12 Peters, 134, 135. Such a recognition of state corporations by the laws of the United States, as persons, having'a lawful
existence, is of course a recognition of them, by the same laws, as
persons possessing all the faculties and attributes conferred upon
them by their charters, To acknowledge them to be persons, when
the3y are so by creation of law, is to acknowledge all that by law
constihlites the persons so created. There can be no distinction.
All the corporate. privileges are of equal authority, as before remarked; and are from the same source.
.This person, thus constituted, 'is not so' entirely artificial as to
conceal or destroy the sbstaitjal character of the individuals associated under its name ; nor to take away their rights, or release them
from their obligations as citizens. Thus a corporation composed of
citizens of one state, with pioper averments on the record, may sue
a citizen of another state in the Courts of the United States. Bank
United States vs. Devaux, 5 Cranch, 61. Where a corporation is
sued in the Circuit Court, it is prima facie evidence to support the
averment of citizenship, that it is incorporated by a law of the state
where it is sued. Catlet vs. Pacific Insurance Company, Paife's
C. C. R. 594. It is only prima facie evidence. 'A bill in equity
was filed by A, a citizen of New Jersey, against B and the Lehigh
Coal and Navigation Company, an incorporated body in Pennsylvania. A plea to the jurisdiction set forth that four of the corporators, naming them, were citizens of New Jersey.. The plea was
sustained; the corporators being the real defendants, by their corporate name, and represented by their officers. Kirkpatrick vs.
White, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 595. A foreign corporation, for the purpose of jurisdiction, is an alien. Society for Propagation of Gospel
vs. Wheeler, 2 Gall. 105. 8 Wheaton, 464. The very case before
the Court admits the jurisdiction, and of course admits the ground
upon which the jurisdiction must rest.
Here then is an association of individuals, clothed by law with
certain faculties, which as individuals they would not have to
transact business, which as individuals they might lawfully transact.
The f6rrmer are their franchises or privileges. They are united,
and one and all conferred by territorial legislation. The substance
of the mnatter is, that it is an exercise of individual rights under a
form authorized by law. It cannot be distinguished in principle
from the case of special partnerships under the laws of Pennsylvania
and New York; where one person becomes the representative of
all, just as the corporate name represents the individual corporators.
They all make up the one person in law.
It must be very obvious (and this is the conclusion sought)- that
the acknowledgment of this person, for any one of its legal attributes, is as full a recognition of the law which created it,as an
acknowledgment of the whole. Such a recognition is equally giving
effect to extra-territorial legislation. In truth, it is an acknowledgmuent oT the whole, for it admits the person created by law. As a
person, having a lawful existence, all the faculties which constitute

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

543

[Ihnk of Augusta vs. Earle,]

the person are admitted, inless there De some .ofthem that are prohibited. This seems an unavoidable though a tedious deduction.
Of the privileges conferred by tie charter, one is to sue and be
stied by the cDrporate name. Can;rsuck a porporatlon, being a
foreign corporation, sue and be sued byits corporate mme ? If it
can, the law which created it is acknowledged as operating, and-of
course the person is acknowledged as the law has made it; arid that
law, it cannot be denied, does give the power to contract in the
corporate name.
The right of foreign states and corporations to sue can be triAcWi
in the books of the law for more than; twos, centuries. The earliest
case is that in B. A. 531, (E. 3, tit: Court de Admiraltie,) King of
Spain's case in Admiraltie. Prohibition was granted, and trover
'directed at common-law in the name of the King of Spain. 2 Bulstr.
322. (12 Jac. 1.) 1 Roll. 133. In Hob. 113, (Jac. 1, between 16i4
and 1625,) the bill was dismissed, because it was in the name of
the ambassador, and not of the King of Spain. Then follows the
case of the Dutch West India Company vs. Henriquez, L. Ray.
1532, 1 Str. 612. (2 Geo. 2. A. D. 1729.) The company, a foreign
corporation, stied by its name of reputation. The suit was sustained; and though the case was much litigated, and carried to the
House of Lords; the right to sue was never denied. This case has
always been considered as having finally settled the question. -The
cases which have since occurred have already been brought into
view in the cause last argued, (by Mr. Ogden,) excepting King of
Spain vs. Mullett, 2 Bligh. 31. There is still another case, of some
note, in which --,were all interested, where a great political corporatiol was ahowed to sue, without dispute, and to recover in the
Courts of England. United States vs. Smithsonos Executors, for
the Smithsonian legacy.
The authorities in the United States are equally uniform. There
are decisions in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Louisiana, and probably in other states. The 'point
is so thoroughly established, as to be assumed in argument. In
Bustal vs. Commonwealth Insurance Company of Boston, 15 Serg.
and Rawle, 173, the question was whether a foreign corporation
was liable to the process of foreign attachnient, Judge Rogers, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania says"
" The power of corporations to sue in personal actions is not restricted to corporations created by the laws of this commonwealth.
If they can sue within a foreign jurisdiction, why should they not
also be liable to suit in the same manner and under the same regulations as domestic corporations ?" See also Williamson vs. Smoot,
7 Mart. Louisiana R. 31. Nor is the authority of this high Court
wanting. In the Society for Propagating the Gospel vs. New Haven,
8 Wheat. 464, the right of a foreign corporation to sue is admitted.
In the same vs. Town of Pawlet, 4 Peters, 480, the- right is sustained; and the Court further decided that the corporate capacity is

544

SUPREME COURT.
(Bank of Augusta v8. Earle.]

admitted by pleading the general issue. If contested, it must be by
a special plea .in abatement, or in bar.
Innumerable cases have occurred in which the question might
have been raised. Instead of this, there are 'rules of pleading and
ru~es of evidence, which assume the right to sue, as unquestionable.
If the charter be put in issue, the foreign law must be produced.
In no one of the decided cases was the suit maintained by virtue
'ot any special law or right. They were all upon the ground of the
common law. In no one of them (unless it be in Pindall vs. Marietta Bank) was the power to contract drawn in question, denied, or
doubted.
In 2 Bligh, 21, Lord Eldon puts a case of contract.
"Suppose the kihg were to send his jewels to be set by Rundell
and Bridge, and the jewellers were hot to deliver them up to the
king, do you think the Courts of the country would not interfere ?"
Lord Redesdale says, "I conceive there can be no doubt that a
sovereign may sue. If he cannot, there is a right without a remedy."
-- "As to the proposition that a sovereign prince cannot sue, it
would be against'all ideas of justice."
No learning is necessary to
understand such arguments as these. The highest legal attainments
are never more fully exhibited than in direct appeals to good sense
and justice.
This doctrine, as has been seen, of the right of the corporations of
one state to sue in the other, is thoroughly incorporated into our system of jurisprudence. How then can it be said there is no comity
between the states? It is established, that the law of the charter is
recognised though granted by another state. The corporation is
clothed everywhere with the character given by the charter. The
whole question is thus settled as' to all corporations. Can it be necessary further to examine the principle upon which this rests ? In
giving corporate powers, the foreign law operates rightfully within
its own territory, as it does in giving validity or construction to a
contract between individuals. It is the exercise of a strictly territorial power in the one act, as it is in the other. There is nothing
extra-territorial in either. The question is, what respect is yielded
to it in another state ? And the answer is found in the fact, that it
is capable of suing .as a domestic corporation may, which is evidence of unbounded, respect. Story's Conflict of Laws, 64, sec.
65-67.
We have been told that foreign executors, administrators, and'
guardians are not acknowledged. If this were so, it would prove
nothing but that for good reasons these cases are excepted from the
general operation of comity. But they are acknowledged. They
'cannot sue. This is the whole extent of the exception. A volun.tary payment to them is good and valid. Besides, the executorship
or administration of the domicil is regarded as the principal, and
any other is only ancillary to it. So that for most, perhaps for all
purposes except enforcing payment by suit, they'are regarded.
But as to contracts the ground of the matter is that the extraterritorial effect is by comity, adopting voluntarily the law of an-

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

545

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

other state, as a rule of decision where it is the proper and natural
rule. This adoption is presumed unless the contrary be made apparent. Such is the doctrine of the common law of the states of this
Union.
And what would be the consequences of a contrary doctrine?
1. The inconvenience, mischief, and injustice that would result
'from. establishing that a corporation can make no valid contract beyond the limits of the state creating it. Consider the immorality of
urging and aiding. the breach of contracts fairly made; especially
if on one side executed. Public policy may sometimes require from
the tribunals to withhold their aid from parties; but they do it from
necessity, and always under a sense of the individual injustice and
wrong that are done. It is a.casual advantage to dishonesty, which
ought not to be often presented, nor unless there be a clear prohibition. What possible inducement is there here?
Consider also the great injury to commerce and trade. Sales for
incorporated manufacturing companies, to the amount of millions,
of dollars annually, are made by their agents. What possible reason
can be given for declaring all such transactions illegal and void?
Insurances are made by incorporated companies against fire, and
against marine risks. Are the policies to be declared void-? To,
what good end?
Again: it must embrace 411 contracts, implied as well as express;
for if it be, unlawful to make ah .express promise, surely the law will
not imply one. No two corporations, in 'different states, can make.
any contract with each other. For one of them must unavoidably
contract out of-the state where it is chartered.' Obligations and
notes of corporations, even bank notes, passed in another state, must
become void, because there is a new contract with the holder.
There would be no end to the enumeration of the mischiefs which
would flow from such a decision.
2. The capacity of corporitions to make contracts beyond their
states, and the exertion of that capacity, are supported by uniform,
universal, and long-continued practice. How many of our corporations have made contracts in England, by their agents? How many
have made contracts in other states ? How many such contracts
are now pending, where the consideration on one side has been
fOlly paid? ' It surpasses all power to estimate them. What disorder and gross wrong would be caused by introducing a principle
that would declare them illegal and void!' And for what good purpose? To abolish a common law found convenient and just, and
adopted as it were by the whole people.
But of this adoption there, is more authentic evidence than this;.
,more tangible, more cognizable in a Court of justice. There is
every kind of evidence.
1. Judicial. Unless it be in a single case, to be adverted to presently; which really is not an exception, there is not an instance of,
such an objection ever being made. This silence is not without sig n~ficance, br cases have been of daily occurrence.
.2z2

546

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank 5tAugusta vs. Earle.]

There is affirmative evidence too.

Society for Propagating the

Gospel vs. Wheeler, 8 Wheat. 464, is to the point. Pindall vs. The
Marietta Bank, 2 Rand., 465, admits that what are there termed
"secondary contracts," may be made. If it seem to go, further, and
question the validity of primary contracts, it is proper to remark that
the action was sustained; and therefore the saying would be merely
obiter, and of little weight, notwithstanding the high authority of the
4Qourt. But what is said has express reference to banking operations, and the restraints upon them by the laws of Virginia. Judge
-Cabell says, "It is our policy to restrain all banking operations by
corporations not established by our laws. It would not therefore be
permitted to a bank in Ohio to establish an agency in this state for
discounting notes, or carrying on other banking operations; nor
could they sustain an action upon notes thus acquired by them."
The policy here referred to is apparent from the statutes of Virginia.
Tait's Dig., 41, &c. Let the Court of Appeals however be its own
expositor. In Reese vs. Conococheague Bank, -5Rand., 326, Green,
Justice, says, " It was decided, 2 Rand., 465, that a foreign corporation
may sue in our Courts, upon a contract with them, valid according
to the laws of the country in which it was made; unless it was contrary to the policy of our laws: and the making a note in Virginia
to be discounted at a foreign bank is not so." Thus explained the
eam admits the power to make contracts by all corporations, excepting primary ones by banks for carrying on 'banking operations,
and by banks for all others. We, might therefore lawfully buy a
bill of exchange in Virginia; and so the case is really an authority
in our favour.
2. Legislative. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, an
incorporated company, sent an agent to Europe to borrow a million
of dollars, to be secured by mortgage upon the three local corporations within this district4 and the United States, under an act of Congress, guarahtied the payment of the interest. Was this a void contrct, being made abroad? The contracts made by the treasury
with the state banks, about the deposit of the public moneys, were
made in law, ao we have seen, dnd. probably. in fact too, in the city
of Washington. Were they void? , The same question might be put
as to the contracts the deposit banks were to make with each other;
which-as to one of them could not fail to be beyond the limits of its
charter. Contracts of the postoffice department with railroad companies, are they all void? These are all instances of contracts with
or by corporations beyond their territorial limits, and yet-they 'lare
recognised by acts of Congress as good.
The methods of proceedin by state legislatures are to the same
effect. In New York there is a law against banking, and, a law
against foreign insurance companies, (companies out of the United
States,) and their agents. ,I Pennsylvania there are sirbilar laws.

How far such prohibitory laws may be carried by state legislation,
without violating the rights of other states and their citizens under
the Constitution of the United States, is not now the question.
They are adduced only as evidence of the concurrence of the state
'legislation with the legislation of the United States, that corporations
could lawfully contract out of their territorial limits unless they were
prohibited. Else why should there be prohibition? The New York
law prohibited foreign insurance companies, properly so callid, from
insuring in New York. If there was any sense in the act, it must
follow that insurance companies of other states 'may still insure in
New York. This is high and authentic evidence of the law from
the highest sources. Have the people, the legislatures, the judiciary,
and the executive, all been hitherto in error from -the time when the
United States, in their need, made their loan in Holland up to the
present time ?
The answer is plain. What is not prohibited is lawful, and is
under the protection of the law. A corporation has a twofold claim.
It has a claim to respect for the law of its creation, and it has a claim
to respect for the rights and privileges of the individuals who compose it. The former is sufficient for the present-purpose. The latter
need not be asserted unless there should be a prohibition, which
under colour of inhibiting the exercise of corporate powers) should
really assail the constitutional rights of the citizen.
It remains only to consider whether there 'is any law of' the
state of Alabama, which forbids the purchase of a bill of exchange.
within her limits by a corporation of another state. Mobile, it
appears, is a market where bills are to be bought, and where it
must be for the interest of sellers that buyers should freely come.
One does not easily perceive what policy there can be to the' contrary, unless it be to enable the state bank of Alabama in some

measure to command the market, by excluding'competition as far
as possible. But whatever was thus gained by the buyer would be
lpst by the seller. The more buyers the better for the seller; the
better for Mobile; the better for Alabama. Nor is it objectionable
because the buyer is a bank. Such a purchase, though it be the
operation of a Dank, is not-a banking operation. What is meant by
banking is well understood and defined. It consists of lending or
discounting, receiving on deposit, and issuing paper. Maine Bank vs.
Butts, 9 Mass., 54. People v&. The Utica Insurance Company, 15
Johns. S90. New York Firemen Insurance Company vs. Ely, 5
Conn., 560. Accordingly the prohibitory laws of the states point
their prohibitions and penalties egainst one or all of these. A banking charter would not, by giving banking privileges, authorize the
dealing in bills of exchange. When such a power is deemed requisite, it is expressly given, as something superadded. A prohibition
of banking would not prohibit the buying exchange by corporations
or by individuals. The policy of'such prohibitory statutes would
not be contravened by buying bills of:exchange. A company incor-

548

SUPREME COUR
[Bank of Augusta v8. Earle.]

porated for buying bills.of exchange would not be a bank either in
a popular or in a legal sense.
Such would have been the clear law to be applied to the case, if
there had been any legislative act against banking in Alabama at
the time of this transaction. Neither the prohibition nor the policy
of the act would have been encountered by the purchase of a bill
of exchange. But there was none. The second section of the act
of 1827 was a general law. 1 Stewart's Reports, 301, 302. In
1833 Aikin's Digest was established, and all laws of" a general and
public nature" not included in it, were repealed from and after the
1st of January then next. Dig. 301, sec. 5. This law is not included in the Digest, and therefore it is repealed. It was under this
law, while it was in force, that Stebbins and others were indicted.
Stewart's Rep. 300. The charge was for issuing bank notes. The
case is not unlike the case of The Utica Insurance Company, in 15
Johns., though the mode of proceeding was different. The defendants were indicted as individuals, and attempted to justify themselves under a very loose and extraordinary charter; which did not
define their powers, and was therefore contended to be without
restriction or limitation. Towards the close of the opinion, the
learned judge speaks of the issuing of bank notes, as being a franchise under the constitution of Alabama. The charter is a franchise,
but it is not perceiv-ed that the acts which might be done by an individual, if not prohibited by laxw, can with propriety be so called,
according to the legal import of the term. 10 Petersdoff, 53, (77,)
note. 4 Com. Dig. 450. But be that as it may, as regards the
issuing of bank notes, it cannot be pretended that the buying or
holding a bill of exchange is a .franchise. If it be, it would follow,
according to the decision in Stebbins' case, that under the act of
1Wh7, an individual might be indicted for buying a bill of exchange.
This proves too much.
The Constitution has no bearing upon the question. It provides
in detail for the establishment of a state bank and branches, and
limits the number of banks the legislature may establish. Aik. Dig.
$5, 56. The state bank is specially authorized to purchase bills of
exchange, conceding that it would not otherwise possess the power;
but there is nothing to prohibit individuals or other corporations
from buying them, nor from which any such prohibition can be implied. It would indeed be derogatory to the character of the state
of Alabama, to suppose that she would be so wan ting to her own
true policy, and to the duties she owes to the citizens of her own
state and of other states, as to deprive them of the use of the ordinary means of transferring their funds, for the sake of conferring an
odious and unjust, and probably fruitless monopoly upon her own
bank. The only effect would be, to impose upon her citizens the
vexation and expense of going abroad in quest of purchasers, instead of having purchasers to come to them.
It is, submitted that the judgment below is.erroneous ;, that it ought

JANUARY TERM, 1809.

549

[Bank of Augusta: vs. Earle.]

to be reversed; and judgment on thecape stated be entered for 'the
plaintiffs.
Mr. Webster, also of counsel with M..r, Sergeant for the United
States Bank.
The United States Bank is a corporation created by a law of
the state of Pennsylvania. By that act the bank, among other
functions,' possesses that of dealing in bills of exchange. In the
month of January, 1837, having funds in Mobile, this bank, through
the instrumentality of its agent, Mt. Poe, purchased a bill' of exchange to remit to New York. This bill, drawn at Mobile upon
New York, and endorsed by William D. Primrose, the defendant in
this case, not having been paid either at New York or by the drawer,
the Bank of the United States instituted this suit in the Circuit
Court of Alabama to recover the money due on the bill.
In the Court below it Yas decided that the contract by Poe
in behalf of the bank was void, on two grounds. 1. Because it
was a contract made by the United States Bank, in the state of
Alabama; whereas a bank incorporated by the state of Pennsyl
vania can do no act out of the limits of Pennsylvania. 2. Because
Alabama has a bank of her own, the capital of which is owned by
the state herself, which is authorized to buy and sell exchange, and
from the profits of which she derives her revenue ; and the purchase
of bills of exchange being a banking operation, the purchase of such
bills by others, at least by any corporation, although there is no express law forbidding it, is against the policy of the state of Alabama ;
as it may be inferred from the provisions of the constitution of that
state, and the law made in conformity thereto.
It is admitted that the parties are rightfully in Court. It is ad-.
mitted also that the defendant is a citizen of Alabama, and that all
the citizens.who compose the corporation of the United States Bank
are citizens of the state of Pennsylvania, or of some other state besides Alabama. The -question is, can they as a corporation do any
act within the state of Alabama? In other words, is there any thing
in the constitution or laws of the state of Alabama which prohibits,
or rightfully can prohibit, citizens of other states, or corporations
created by otber states, from buying and selling bills of exchange
in the state of Alabama?
In his argument for the defendant in this case, my learned
friend, Mr. Vande Gruff, asked certain questions, which I propose
to answer.
Can this bank, said he, transfer itself into the state'of Alabama?
Certainly not.
Can it establish a branch in the state of Alabama, there to perform the same duties and transact the same business in all respects
as in the state of Pennsylvania ? Certainly not.
Can it exercise in the state of Alabama any of its corporate functions? Certainly it can. For my learned friend admits its right to
sue in that state, which is a right that it possesses solely by the

SUPREME COURT.
(Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

authority of the Pennsylvania law by which the -bank is incorporatea.
We ths clear the case of some difficulty by arriving at this point,
the admission on both sides that there are certain powers which the
bank can exercise within the state of Alabama, and certain others
:which it cannot exercise.
The question is, then, whether the bank can exercise within the
state of Alabama this vefy power of buying a bill of exchange?
Our proposition is, that she can buy a bill of exchange within the
state of Alabama: because there are no corporate functions necessary to the act of buying of a bill of exchange: because buying and
selling exchange is a thing open to all the world, in Alabama as
-yell as everywhere else : because, although the power to buy and
sell bills of exchange be-conferred upon this bank by its charter,
and it could not buy or sell a bill of exchange without that provision
in its charter, yet this power was conferred upon it, as were other
powers conferred by its charter, to place the bank upon the same
footing as an indi~idual; to give it not a monopoly, not an exclusive
privilege in this respect, but simply the same power which the
members of the corporation as individuals have an unqUestionable
right to exercise. The banker, the broker, the merchant, the manufacturer, all buy bills of exchange as individuals. The individuals
who compose a corporation may do it; and we say that they may
do it, though they do it in the name of, and for the corporation.
We say, undoubtedly, that they cannot acquire po.over under the
Pennsylvania charter to do acts in Alabama which they cannot do
as individuals; but we say that the corporation may do in their corporate character in Alabama, all such acts authorized by their charter as the members thereof would have a right to perform as
individuals.
The learned counsel on the other side was certainly not disposed
to concede gratuitously any thing in this case, Yet he did admit
that there might be a case in which the acts of a corporation, created
by one state, if done in another state, would be valid. He supposed
the case of a railroad company in one state sending an agent into
another state to buy iron for the construction of the'road. Without
conceding expressly the point of law in that case, he admitted that
it would be a case very different from the present; and he gave as
a reason for this admission, that it would be a single special act,
necessary to enable the corporation to execute its functions within
the state to which it belonged; and in this respect differing from the
case now under consideration. In what circumstance, it may well
be asked, do the-cases differ ? One act only of the corporation
of the United States TBank is set forth in this record, and that act
stands singly and by itself. There is'no proof before the Court that
the corporation ever bought another bill of exchange than that
which is the subject of this suit. Transactions of this nature must
necessarily come one by one before this-Court when they come at
all, and must stand- or fall on their individual merits, and not upon

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

551

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.)

the supposition of any policy which would recognise the legality of
a single act, and deny the validity of the dealings or transactions
generally of which that act is a part.
Then, as to the other reason stated by my learned friend in support of the idea that such a purchase of iron might be supported, he
says it is because that, in that case, the purchase being made abroad
solely to enable the corporation to perform its 'functions at home,
might be considered legal under the law of comity from one state to
another.
Now, said Mr. Webster, that supposed case is precisely the case
before the Court. Here is the case of a corporation established in
Philadelphia, one of whose lawful functions is to deal in exchange.
A Philadelphia merchant, having complied with the order of his
correspondent in Alabama, draws a bill upon him for the amount
due in consequence, goes to the United States Bank, and sells the
bill. The funds thus realized by the bank from the purchase of
bills of exchange accumulate in Alabama. How are those funds to
be brought back by the Philadelphia corporation within its control?
The bank has unquestioned - power to deal in bills of exchange.
Can there be such a thing as dealing in exchange, with a power to
'act only on one end of the line? Certainly not. How then is the
bank in Philadelphia to get its funds back from Alabama ? Suppose
that it were to send an agent there, and buy specie. Can the bank
ship the specie ? Can it sign an agreement for the freight, insurance,
and charges of bringing it round? To do that would be an act of
commerce, of navigation, not of exchange. A power conferred upon
a bank to deal in exchange would be perfectly nugatory, unless accompanied by a power also to direct its funds to be remitted. The
practical result of a contrary construction would be, that this Pennsylvania bank may carry on exchange between Philadelphia and
1:-ding, or Philadelphia and Lancaster, but not by possibility with
Mobile, or any other city or place in the south, or even with New
York, Trenton, or Baltimore. Out of Pennsylvania it could only_
buy and remit. It could get no return. An exchange that runs but
one way! What sort of an exchange is that?
Having cleared the case of some of these generalities, Mr. Webster proceeded to the exposition of what he considered a constitutional, American view of the question.
The record of this case finds that these plaintiffs, the members of
the corporation of the United States Bank, are citizens of other
states, and that the defendant is a citizen of Alabama. Now,
in the first place, to begin with the beginning of this part of the
question, what are the relations which the individual citizens of one
state bear to the individual citizens of any other state of this Union?
How did the matter stand before the Revolution? When these
states were colonies, what'was the relation between the inhabitants
of the different colonies? Certainly it was not that of aliens. They
were not indeed-all citizens of the same colony; but certainly they
were fellow-subjects, and owed a common allegiance; and it was

552

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

not competent for the legislative power to say that the citizens of
any one of the colonies should be alien to the other. This was the
state of the case until the 4th of July, 1776, when this common allegiance was thrown off. After a short interval of two years, after
the renunciation of that allegiance, the articles of confederation
were adopted; and now let us see what was ihe relation between
the citizens of the different states by the articles of confederation.
The government had become a confederation. But it was something more-imuch more. It was not merely an alliance between
distinct governments for the common defence and general welfare, but
it recognised and confirmed a community of interest, of character,
and of privileges, between the citizens of the several states. "The
better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse
among the people of the different states in this Union," said the
fourth of the articles of confederation, "the free inhabitants of each
of these states shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities
of free citizens in the several states; and the people of each state
shall have free ingress and egress to and from any other state, and
shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce," &c.
This placed the inhabitants of each state on equal ground as to the
rights and privileges which they might exercise in every other state.
So things stood at the adoption of the Constitution of the United
States. The article of the present Constitution, in fewer words and
more general and comprehensive terms, confirms this community
of rights and privileges in the following form "The citizens of each
state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens
in the several states." However obvious and general this provision
may be, it will be found to have some particular application to the
case now before the Court; the article in the confederation serving
as the expounder of this article in the Constitution.
That this article in the Constitution does not confer on the citizens
of each state political rights in every other state, is admitted. A
citizen of Pennsylvania cannot go into Virginia and vote at an election in that state; though, when he has acquired a residence in Virginia, and is otherwise qualified as required by I' :, constitution, he
becomes, without formal adoption as a~citizen of Virginia, a citizen
.of that state politically. But for the purposes of trade, commerce,
buying, and selling, it is evidently not in the power of any state to
impose any hinderance or embarrassment, or lay any excise, toll,
duty, or exclusion, upon citizens of other states, to place them,
coming the- upon a different footing from her own citizens.
There is one provision then in the Constitution, by which citizens
of one state may trade in another without hinderance or embarrassment.
There is another provision of the Constitution by which citizens
of one state are, entitled to sue citizens of any other state in the
Courts of the United States.
This is a very plain and clear right under the Constitutior; but
it is not more clear than the preceding.

JANUARY TERM, 1839

553

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.)
Here then are two distinct constitutional provisions conferring
power upon citizens of Pennsylvania and every other state, as to.
what they may do in Alabama or any other state: citizens of other
states may trade in Alabama in whatsoever is lawful to citizens of
Alabama; and if, in the course of their dealings, they have claims
on citizens of Alabama, they may sue in Alabama in the Courts of
the United States. This is American, constitutional law, independent of all comity whatever.
By the decisions of this Court it has been settled that this right to
sue is a right which may be exercised in the name of a corporation.
Here is one of their rights then which may be exercised in Alabama
by citizens of another state in the name of a corporation. Ifcitizens
of Pennsylvania can exercise in Alabama the right to sue in the
name of a corporation, what hinders them from exercising in the
same manner this other constitutional right, the right to trade ? If
it be the established right of persons in Pennsylvania to sue in Alabama in the name of a corporation, why may they not do any other
lawful act in the name of a corporation? If no reason to the contrary can be given, then the law in the one case is the law also
in the other case.
My learned friend says, indeed, that suing and making a contract are different things. True; but this argument, so far as it has
any force, makes against his cause ; for it is a much more distinct
exercise of corporate power to bring a suit, than by an agent to
make a purchase. What does the law take to be true, when it says
that a corporation of one state may sue in another? Why, that the
corporation is there, in Court, ready to submit to the Court's decree,
a party on its record. But in the case of the purchase of the bill of
exchange, such as is the subject of this suit, what is assumed? No
more than that George Poe bought a bill of exchange, and paid the
value for it, on account of his employers in Philadelphia. So far
from its being a more natural right for a corporation to be allowed
to sue, it is a more natural right to be allowed to trade in a state in
which the corporation does not exist. What is the distinction ?
Buying a bill of exchange is said to be an act, and therefore the
corporation could not do it in Alabama. Is not a suit an act? Is
it not doing? Does it not, in truth, involve many acts?.
The truth is, that this argument against the power of a corporation
to do acts beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the authority by which
it is created, is 'refuted by all history as well as by plain reason.
What have all the great corporations in England been doing for
centuries back? The English East India Company, as far back as
the reign of Elizabeth, has been trading all over the eastern world.
That company traded in Asia before Great Britain had established
any territorial government there, and in other parts of the world,
where England never pretended to any territorial authority. The
Bank of England, established in 1694, has been always trading atqd
dealingin exchanges and bullion with Hamburg, Amsterdam, and
other marts of Europe. Numerous other corporations have been
VOL. XIII.-3 A
70

54

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

created in England, for the purpose of exercising power over matters and things in territories wherein the power of England has
never been exerted. The whole commercial world is full of such
corporations, exercising similar powers, beyond the territorial jurisdiction within which they have legal existence.
I say, then, that the right, secured to the people of Pennsylvania,
to sue in any other state in the name of a corporation, is. no more
clear than this other right of such a corporation to trade in any
other state; nor even so clear: it is a farther fetched legal presumption, or a much greater extent of national courtesy or conmity, to
suppose a foreign corporation actually in Court, in its legal existence,
with its legal attributes, and acting in its own name, than it is to allow an ordinary act of trade, done by its agent, on its own account,
to be .a valid transaction.
Mr. Webster here referred to an opinion of this Court directly bearing on this question. It was the case of the Bank of the United States
vs. Deveaux, decided in 1809. The bank here mentioned was the
first Bank of the United States, which had not, like the last, express
authority given in its charter, to sue in the Courts of the United
States. It sued, therefore, as this plaintiff sues, in its name as a
corporation; but with an averment, as here, that its members were
citizens of Pennsylvania, the action being brought against a citizen
of Georgia. The only question was, whether the plaintiffs might
not exercise their constitutional right to sue in the Courts of the
United States, although they appeared in the name of their Pennsylvania corporation; and the Court decided that they might.
';Substantially and essentially," said Chief Justice Marshall, "the
parties in such a case, where the members of the corporation are
aliens, or citizens of a different state from the opposite party,.come
within the spiit and terms of the jurisdiction conferred by the Coni
stitution on the national tribunals." "That corporations composed
of citizens, arc considered by the legislature as citizens, under certain circumstances, is to be strongly inferred from the registering
acts. It never could be intended that an American registered vessel, abandoned to an insurance company composed of citizeps, shouild
lose her character as an American vessel; and yet this would be the
consequence of declaring that the members of the corporation were,
to every intent and purpose, out of view, and merged in the corporation."
The argument here is, that citizens may exercise their rights of
suing, as such citizens, in the name of their corporation; because,
in such a name, the law recognises them as competent to engage in
transactions, hold property, and enjoy rights proper for them as
citizens.,
If the Court agree in this language of its own opinion as far back
as the year 1809, it must be admitted that the rights of the people
of Pennsylvania, as citizens of the United States, are not merged in
the act of incorporation by which they aie associated, and under
which they arq parties to this suit. If there ever was a human

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

555

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

being that did not argue to the obscure from the more obscure, it
was certainly the late Chief Justice of the United States. And
what was his argument to prove that the citizens of one state- may
sue in another by a corporate name ? It is, as I have said, that they
may sue by a corporate name, because they can do acts out of Court
by a corporate name; whilst, directly reversing this conclusion, it has
been held in this case, in th:- Court below, that, whilst.a corporation
of one state may rightfully sue in another state, it cannot do any
other act therein.
In this view of the case, said Mr. Webster, I see no occasion to
invoke the law of comity or international courtesy to our aid. Here
our case stands, independently of that law, on American ground, as
an American question.
Now, as to the reason of the case. What possible difference can
it make, if these citizens of Pennsylvania can trade, or buy and
sell bills, in Alabama, whether the trading, or buying and selling,
be under one agency or another? That Poe (the agent of the
United States Bank at Mobile) could, under a power of attorney
from a citizen of Philadelphia, buy and sell bills of exchange in
Alabama, will not be denied. If, without an, act of incorporation,
several citizens of Philadelphia should form an association to buy
and sell bills of exchange, with five directors or managers of its concerns, those five directors may send as many agents as they please
into other states to buy bills of exchange, &c. Having thus formed
themselves into this associated company, and appointed agents for
the purpose of, transacting their business, if they should go one step
further, and obtain a charter from Pennsylvania, that their meetings
and proceedings may be more regular, and the acts of the association more methodical, what wouid be the difference, in the eye of
reason, between the acts of the members of such a corporation, and
the acts of the same individuals, associated for the same purposes,
without incorporation, and acting by common agents, correspondents,, or attorneys ! The officers of a bank are but theagents of
the proprietors; and their purchases and sales are founded upon
their property, and directed by their will, in the same manner as the
acts of agents of unincorporated associations or partnerships. The
Girard Bank, we all know, was never incorporated until after Mr.
Girard's death; yet its proprietor, during a considerable part of his
life, and until his death, acted as a banker. Could he not, during
his life, send an agent into Alabama, and there purchase bills of
exchange ? And if his neighbours over the way chose to ask for
an act of incorporation from the state of Pennsylvania, are they
thereby less entitled to the privileges common to all other citizens,
than Stephen Girard was?
I agree, certainly, generally, that a state law cannot operate exterritorially, as the phrase is. But it is a rule of law that a state
authority may create an artificial being, giving it legal existence;
and that that being, thus created, may legally sue in other states
than that by which it is created. It follows, of course, as a conse-

556

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.)

quence of the right of suit in another state, that it may obtain judgment there. If it obtain judgment, it may accept satisfaction of
that judgment. If 'a judgment be obtained in Alabama by the
United States Bank, would not an ecknowledgment of satisfaction by
an agent of the bank be a satisfaction of the decree of the Court ?
How is the fruit of a suit to be gathered, if the bank, by its agent,
cannot do this: act? What benefit can it be to this bank to be
allowed to sue in Alabama, if it cannot take the money sued for ?
But it is said by the Court below, that it cannot recover money in
Alabama, because it cannot do an act there! According to this argument, although the power to appeal to law, and the power to recover judgment exist, yet the fructus legis is all dust and ashes.
On the commercial branch of this question (Mr. Webster continued) he would say but little. But this much he would say: The
state of Alabama cannot make any commercial regulation for her
own emolument or benefit, such as should create any difference between her own citizens and citizens of other states. He did not say
that the state of Alabama may not make corporations, and give to
them privileges which she does not give to her citizens. But he did
say, that she cannot create a monopoly to the prejudice of citizens
of other states, or to the disparagement or prejudice of apy common commercial right. Suppose that a person having occasion to
purchase bills of exchange should not like the credit of bills sold by
the Bank of Alabama; or suppose (what is within the reach of possibility) that the Bank of Alabama should fail; may not a citizen,
buy bills elsewhere ? Or is it supposed that the state of Alabama
can give such a preference to any institution of her own in the buying and selling of exchange, that no exchange can be bought and
sold within her limits, but by that institution? It would be, doubtless, doing the state great injustice to suppose that she could entertain any such purpose.
In conclusion of the argument upon this point, said Mr. Webster,
I maintain that the plaintiffs in this case had a right to purchase
this bill and to recover judgment upon it. For the same reason that
they had a right to bring this suit, they had the right to do the act
upon which the suit was brought. \\
But if the rights of the plaintiffs, under this constitutional view of
the case, be doubted, then what has been called the comity of nations obliges the Court to sustain the plaintiffs in this cause.
The term "comity" is taken from the civil law. Vattel has no
distinct chapter upon that head. But the doctrine is laid down by
other authorities with sufficient distinctness, and in effect by him.
It is, in general terms, that there are, between nations at peace with
one another, rights, both natural and individual, resulting from the
comity or courtesy due from one friendly nation to another. Among
these, is the right to sue in their Courts respettively ; the right to
travel in each other's dominions; the right to pursue one's vocation
in trade ; the right to do all things, generally, which belong to the
citizens proper of each country, and which flihey are not precluded

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

557

[Bank of Augusta vs. Larle.]

from doing by some positive law of the state. Among these rits,
one of the clearest is the right of a citizen of one nation to take
away his property from the territory of any other friendly nation,
without molestation or objection. This is'what we call the comity
of nations. It is the usage of nations, and has become a p6siOve
obligation on all nations. I know, said Mr. Webster,, that it is but
a customary or voluntary law; that it is a law existing by the common understanding and consent of nations, and not established for
the government of nations by any common superior. For this reason, every nation, to a certain extent, judges for itself of the extent
of the obligation of this law, and puts its own construction upon it,
Every other nation, however, has 'a right to do the same; and if;
therefore, any two nations differ irreconcileably in their construction
of this law, there is no resort for settling that difference but the ultima ratio regum
The right of a foreigner to sue in the Courts of any country may
be regulated by particular laws or ordinances of that country. He
may be required to give security for the costs of suit in any case, or
not to leave the country until the end of the controversy. He may
possibly be required to-give security that he will not carry his property out of the country till his debts are paid. But if, under pretence of such regulation, any nation shall impose unreasonable
restrictions or penalties on the citizens of any other nation, the power
of judging that matter for itself lies with that 5ther nation. Sup
pose that the government of the United States, for example,. shligd
say that every foreigner should pay into the public treasury ten,
twenty, or fifty per cent. of any amount which he might eover by
suit in our Courts of law; would such a regulation be perfectly just
and right? Or would not the practice of such extortion upon the
citizens of other nations be a just ground of complaint, and, if unredressed, a ground of war, much more sufficient than most of the
causes which put nations in arms against one another? What is,
in fact, now the question, which has assumed so serious an aspect,
between the governments of France and Mexico? One of the leading causes of difference between the two countries, so far as 1 under-.
stand it, is'not that the Ciourts of Mexico are not open to the citizens:
or subjects of France, but that the Courts do not do jistice between
them and the citizens of Mexico; in other words, that French subjects are not treated in Mexico according to the comity of the law
of nations. LMr. Webster said. he did not speak of the merits oif
this quarrel: into that he did not enter; le spoke only of things
alleged between the parties.] Look, said Mr. Webster, into Vatte,,
and you will find that this very right to carry away property, the,

against the citizens of either nation, (to do so would be only a vio4atima of the comity of nations,) and should grant them no redress
upon complaint being made: it might unquestionably be ground of
war against the United States by that nation.
There are in London several incorporated insurance companies.
Suppose a ship insured by one of these companies should be wrecked
in the "Chesapeake bay. Being abandoned, she becomes the property of the corporation by which she was insured. I demand
whether the insurers may not come and take this property, and
bring an action for it, if necessary, in any Court in this country,
state or federal? They may-recover by an action of tort against
the wrongdoer. They may,replevy their property, if necessary, or
sell it; or refit it; or send it back. Unquestionably, if any country
were to debar the citizens of another country of the enjoyment of

these common rights within its territorial jurisdiction, it would be
cause of war. I do not mean that a single act of that sort would
or should bring on a war; but it would be an act of that-nature, so
plain and manifest a violation of our -duty under the law of nations,
as to justify war. According to the judgment of the Court below
in the present, case, however, these insurance colipanies would be
deprived of their rightful remedy. You let them sue, indeed; but
that is all.
Mr. Webster here referred to a case tried some time ago in the
Cjrcuit CoIrt of the Massachusetts district, in which he was counsel,
in which a vessel insured in Boston was wrecked in Nova Scotia,
and was abandoned to the insurers.. The insurance office sent out
an agent, who, did that which the owner of the vessel said was an

agent of the Boston. office accepted the abandonment, (said Mr.
Webster,) the Court'decided the case. If we had said that We sent
him down, indeed, but that his agency ceased when he got to the
boundary line of the state, and he could- do no act when he got
beyond it, and the Court had agreed with us, we might, perhaps,
have gained our eause. But it never occurred to me, nor probably
to the'Court, that the agency of our agent terminated the roment
that he passed the limits of the state.
The law of comity is a part of the law of nations; and it does
authorize a corporation of any 'state to make contracts beyond the
limits of that state.
How does a state contract? How many of the states of this
Union. have made contracts for loans in England? A state is sove-.
reign, in a certain sense. But when a' state sues, it sues as a corporation.. When it enters into contracts with the citizens of foreign
nations, it does so in its. corporate charactel? I now say, that it is,
the adjudged and admitted law of the world, that corporations have,
the 'same right to contract and to sue in foreign countries, as indi-.
viduals have. 'By the law of nations, individuals of other countries
are allowed in this country to contract and sue; and we make no
distinction, in the case of individuals, between the right to, sue and

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

559

[Bank of Augusta v. Earle.]

the right to contract. Nor can any such distinction be sustained in
law in the case of corporations. Where, in history, in the books, is
any law or dictum to be found (except the disputed case from Vir.
ginia) in which a distinction is drawn between the rights of individuals and of corporations to contract and sue in foreign countries
in regard to things, generally, free and open to everybody? In the
whole civilized world, at home and abroad, in England, Holland,
and other countries of Europe, the equal rights of corporations and
individuals, in this respect, have been undisputed until .now, and in
this case; and if a distinction is to be set up between them at this
day, it lies with the counsel on the other side to produce some seniblance of authority-or show of reason for it.
But it is argued, that though this law of comity exists as between
independent nations, it does not exist between the states of this
Union. That argument appears to have been the foundation of the
judgment in the Court below.
In respect to this law of comity, it is' said, states are not nations;
they~have no national sovereignty; a sort of residuum of sovereignty
is all that remains to them. The national sovereignty, it is said, is
conferred on this government, and part of the municipal sovereignty.
The rest of the municipal sovereignty belongs to the states. Notwithstanding the respect which I entertain for the learned judge
who presided-in that Court, I cannot fbllow in the train of his argument. I can make no diagram, such as thisj of the partition of
national character between the state and the general governments.
I cannot map, it out, and say so far is national, and so far municipal;
and here it the exact line where the 6ne begins and the other ends.
We have n second Laplace, and we never shall have, with his
Mchanique Politique, able to define and describe the orbit of each
sphere in our political system with such exact mathematical precision. There is no such thing a arranging these governments of
ours by the laws of gravitation, so that they will be sure to go on
forever without impinging. These institutions are practical, admirable,' glorious, blessed creations. Still they were, when created,
experimental institutions ; and if the convention which framed the
constitution of the United States had set down dit it certain general
definitions of power, such as have been alleged in the argument of
this case, and stopped there, I verily believe that in the course of
the fifty years which have since elapsed, this government would
have never gone into operation.
Suppose that this Constitution had said, in terms, after the language of the Court below-all national sovereignty shall belong to
the United States; all municipal sovereignty to the several states.
I will say, that however clear, however distinct, such a definition
may appear to those who use it, the employment of it-in the.Constitution could only have led to utter confusion and uncertainty. . I
am not prepared to say that the states have no national sovereignty.The laws of some of the states-Maryland and Virginia, for instance-provide punishment for treason. The power thus exereised-

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

is certainly not municipal. Virginia has a law of alienage: that is,
a power exercised against a foreign nation. Does not the question
necessarily arise, when a power is exercised concerning an alien
enemy-enemy to whom? The law of escheat, which exists in all
the states, is also the exercise of a great sovereign power.
The term "sovereignty" does not occur in the Constitution at all.
The Constitution treats states as states, and the United States as the
JUnited States; and by a careful enumeration declares all the powers
that are granted to the United States, and all the rest are reserved
to the states, If we pursue, to the extreme point, the powers
granted, and the powers reserved, the powers of the general and
state governments will be found, it is to be feared, impinging, and
in conflict. Our hope is, that the pi'udence and patriotism of the
states, and the wisdom of this government, will prevent that catastrophe. For myself, I will pursue the advice of the Court in
Deveaux's case; I will avoid nice metaphysical subtilties, and all
useless theories; I will keep my feet out of the traps of general definition; I will keep my feet out of all traps: I will keep to things
as they are, and go no further to inquire what they might be, if
they were not what they are. The states of thi Union, as states,
are subject to all the volhvitary and customary law of nttions.
[Mr. Webster here referred to, and quoted a passage from Vattel,
(page 61,) which, he said, clearly showed that stat es connected
together as are the states of this Union, must be considered as much
component parts of the law of nations as any others.3
If, for the decision of any question, the proper rule is to be found
in the law of nations, that law adheres to the subject. It follows
the subject through, no matter into what place, high or low. You
cannot escape the law of nations in a case where it is applicable,
The air of every judicature is full 'of it. It pervades the Courts of
law of the highest character, and the Court of pie poudre; ay, even
the constable's Court. It is part of the universal law. It may
share the glorious eulogy pronounced by IookeF upon law itself:
that there is nothing'so high as to be beyond the reach of its power,
nothing so low as to be beneath its care. If any question be within
the influence of the law of nations, the law of nations is there. If
the law of comity does not exist between the states of this Union,
how can it exist between a state and the subjects of any foreign
sovereignty ?
Upon all the consideration that I have given to the case, the conclusion seems to rme inevitable, that'if the law of comity do not
exist between the states of this Union, it cannot exist between the
states individually and foreign powers. It is true a state cannot
make a treaty; she cannot, be a party to a new chapter on the law.
of nations: but the law which prevails among nations-the customary rule of judicature, recognised by all nations-binds her in all
her Courts.
I have heard no answer to another argument. If a contract be

cuted, and suit is brought upon it in Alabama, it is to be decided
by the law of the state in which the contract was rhade. In a case
now before this Court, there has been a decision by the Court of
Alabama, in which that Court has undertaken to learn the law of
the state of New York, and administer it in Alabama. Why take
notice in Alabama of the law of New York? Because, simply,
there are cases in which the Courts in Alabama feel it to be their
duty to administer that law, and to enforce rights accordingly:
That, said Mr. Webster, is the -very point for which we contend,
viz.: the Court in Alabama should have given effect to rights exercised in that state by the plaintiff in the present cause, under the
ailthority of Pennsylvania, without prejudice to the state of Alabama.
After ill that has been said in argument about corporations, they
are but forms of special partnership, in some of which the partners
are severally liable. The whole end and aim of most of them, as
with us, is to concentrate the means of small capitalists in a form
in which they can be used to advantage.
In the eastern states, manufactures, too extensive for individual
capital, ard carried on in this way. A large quantity of goods is
manufactured and sold to the south, out of cotton' bought in the
south, to the amount of many millions in every year. Upon the
principle of the decision in the Court below, the manufacturers of
the goods and the growers of the cotton would be equally precluded
from recovering their dues. What will our fellow-citizens of the
south say to this.? If, after we have got their cotton, they cannot
get their*money for it, they will be in no great love, I think, with
these new doctrines, about the comity of states and nattions.
Again, look at the question as it regards the insuranoe offices.
How are all marine insurances, fire insurances, and life insurances,
effected in this country, but by the agency of companies incorporated
by the several states? And the insurances, made by these companies beyond the limits of their particular states, .are they all void?
I suppose that the insurances against fire, effected for companies at
Hartford, in Connecticut alone, by agents all over the northern
states,"may amount to an aggregate of some millions of dollars. I
remember a case occurring in New Hampshire, of a suit against
one of those qompanies for the amount of an insurance, in which a
recovery was had against the company.; and nothing was said, nor
probably thought,-of such a contract of insurance being illegal, on
the ground that a *corporation of Connecticut could not do an act or
matke a contract in New Hampshire. Are those insurances all to
be held void, Upon the principle of the decision from Alabama?
And as to notes issued by banks: if one in Alabama hold the
notes of a bank incorporated by Pennsylvania, are they void? If
onp be robbed there of such notes, is it no theft? If one counterfeits tiose notes there, is it no crime? Are all such notes mere
nullfties, when out of the state where issued?
Reference has been made to the statute-books to show cases in.

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

which the states have forbidden foreign insurance companies from
making insurances within their limits. But no such prohibition has
been shown against insurances by citizens 'of, or companies created
in, the different states. Is not this an exact case for the application
of the rule exceptio probat regulam ? The fact of such prohibitory
legislation shows that citizens of othet states have, and that citizens
of foreign powers had, before they were excluded by law, the right
to make insurances in any and every one of the states.
,
Mr. Webster next called the attention of the Co1't to the deposite
law-passed by Congress on the 23d of June, 1836. It was, said he,
one of the conditions upon which, under that act, any state bank
should become a depository of the public money, that it should enter
into obligations " to render to the government all the duties and
services heretofore required by law to be performed by the late
Bank of the United States, and its several branches or offices ;" that
is, to remit money to any part of the United States, transfer it from
one state to another, &c. But that act required, also, something
more: and it shows how little versed we in Congress were (and, I
take to myself my full share of the shame) in the legal obstacles to
the doing of aets in one state by corporations of other states. The
first section of that act provides, that "in those states, territories, or
districts, in which there are no banks," &c., the Secretary of the
Treasury "may make arrangement with a bank or banks in some
other state, territory, or district, to establish an agency or agencies
in the states, territories, or districts, so destitute of banks, as banks
of deposite," &c. -Here is an express recognition by Congress of
the power of a state bank to create an agent for the purpose of
dealing as a bank in another state or territory.
It has been said, that as there is no law of comity under the law
,of nations between the states, it remains 'for the legislatures of the
several states to adopt, in their conduct towards each other, as much
of the principle of comity as they please. Here, then, there is to be
negotiation between the states, to determine how far they will observe this law of comity. They are thus required to do precisely
what they cannot do. States cannot make treaties nor compacts.
A state cannot negotiate. It cannot even hold an Indian talk!
And now I would ask how it happens, at this time of the day, that
this Court shall be called upon to make a decision contrary to the
spirit of the Constitution, and against the whole course of decisions
in this country and iniEurope,-and the undisputed practice under
this government for fifty years, overturning the law of comity, and
leaving it to ,the states, each to establish a comity for itself?
Mr. Webster here took l6aive of the question of the power of a corporation created by one of the $tates to make contracts in another.
I now proceed, said Mr. Webster, to consider whether there
be, any thing in the law or constitution of the state of Alabama,
which-prevents the agent of the United States Bank,.in that state,
from making such a contract as that which is the foundation of this
suit.

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

[Bap'k of Augusta vs. Earle.)

It is said that the buying 'of a bill of exchange by such agent is
contrary to the policy of the state of Alabama ; and this is inferred
from the law establishing the Bank of Alabama; that baik being
authorized to deal in bills of exchange, and the constitution of the
state authorizing the establishment of no other than one bank in the
state.,
This, said Mr. Webster, is a violent inference.
How does the buying or selling bills of exchange in Alabama, by
another purchaser than the Bank of Alabama, infringe her policy ?
Because, it is said, it diminishes the profits which she derives from
the dealings of the bank. Profit is her policy, it is argued; gain,
her end. Is it against her policy for Mr. Biddle to buy bills, because
his bank is incorporated ; and not against her policy for Mr. Girard.
to buy bills, because his is not incorporated ? Or, how far does she
carry this policy imputed to her ? Is no one to be allowcd to buy
or sell bills of exchange in Alabama but a bank of her own, which
may or may not be in credit, and may or may not be solvent ?I It.
would be strange, indeed, were any state in this Union to adopt
such a policy as this. But, if the argument founded on this inferred
policy of Alabama amounts to any thing, it proves, not that incorporated citizens of other states cannot buy or sell bills there, but
that it is the policy of Alabama to-prevent other citizens -from'buying bills at all in Alabama.
I think, said Mr. Webster, that there is no just foundation for the
inference of any such policy on the part of the state of Alabama..
By referring to Aikins Digest of the laws of that state, it will be
found that'she has carried her policy a little farther than merely the
establishing of a bank. Her public officers are authorized to receive
the notes of banks of other states in payment of dues to her; and
she has enacted laws to pimish the forgery of notes of other banks.
Now, taking their acts together, considering them as a whole, the
inference which has been dra 7n from her establishment of a State
Bank under her constitution is certainly not sustained.
To consider this argument, however, more closely: it is assumed
by it, first, that the state meant, by her legislation, to take to herself
all the profits, of banking within her territorial limits; arid, secondly,
that the act o'f buying and selling a bill of exchange belongs to
banking.
The profits of banking are derived more from circulation than
from exchange. If the state meant, through her bank policy, to
take all the profits of banking, why has she not taken all the profits'
of circulation ? Not only has she done no such thing, but she protects the circulation of notes of banks of other states.
Mr. Webster begged now to ask the particular attention of the
Court to this question:- What is banking?
Alabama, in reference to banking, has done nothing but. established a bank, and given it the usual banking powers. And when the
learned counsel on the other cide speak' of banking, what do they
mean by it? A bank deals in exchanges ; and it buys or builds
'

SUPREME COURT.
[Banlk of Augusta vi. Earle.]

houses, also; so do individuals. If there be any thing peculiar in
these acts by a bank, it must be not in the. nature of the acts individually, but in the aggregate of the' whole. What constitutes banrking,-must be something peculiar. There are vatrious acts of legislation, by different states in this country, for granting or preventing
the zxercise o banking privileges. But ha any law ever beer,
passed to authorize or to prevent the buying by an individual of a
bill of exchange? No one has ever heard of such a thing. The
laws to restrain banking have all been directed to one end; that is,
to repress the unauthorized circulation of paper money. There are
vaious other functions performed by banks; but, in discharging all
these, they only do what unincorporated individuals do.
What is that, then, without which any institution is not a bank,
and with which it is a bank? It is a power to issue promissory
notes with a view to their circulation as money.
Our ideas of banking have beenderived principally from the act
constituting the first Bank of the United States, and the idea of that
bank was borrowed from the Bank of England. To ascertain the
character and peculiar functions of the Bank of England, Mr. Webster had referred, and referred the Court, to various authorities: to
M'Culloch's Commercial Dictionary; to Smollett's contipuation of.
Hume's England; to Godfrey's History of the Bank of England,
in Lord Somers' Tracts, 11th volume, 1st article; to Anderson's
History
of Commerce, &c.
The project
of the Bank of England was conceived, Mr. Webster
said, by'Mr. Paterson, a Scotch gentleman, who had travelled much
abroad, and had seen somewhere (he believed in Lombardy) a
small bank which issued tickets or promises of payment of money.
From this he took the idea of a bank of circulation. That was in
1694. - At that time neither inland bills nor promissory notes were
negotiable or transferable, so as to enable the holder to bring suit
thereonin his own name. There was no negotiable paper except
foreign bills of exchange. Mr. Paterson's conception was that the
notes of the Bank of England should be negotiable toties quoties, or
transferable from hand to hand, payable at the bank in specie,
either on demand or at very short sight. - This conception had complete success, because there was then no other inland paper, either
bills or notes, which were negotiable. The.whole field was occupied
by Bank of England notes. In 1698 inland bills were made negotiable by act of Parliament; and in the fourth year of Queen Anne's
reign promissory notes Were made negotiable. Of course after this
everybody might issue promissory notes, and where they had credit
enough they might circulate as money. There is not much of
novelty in the inventions of mankind. Under this state of things,
that took place in England which we have seen so often take place
among us, and which we have put to the account of :modern contrivance. Large companies were formed, with heavy amounts of
capital, for purposes not professedly banking; one, especially, to
carry on. the mining business on a large scale. These companies

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

565

[Batk o Augusta vs. Earle.)

issued promissory notes, payable on demand; and these notes
readily got into circulation as cash, to the prejudice of the circulation
of the Bank of Fngland. But Parliament being at this time in
great'want of ready money for the expenditures of the war on the
Continent, the bank proposed to double its capital, and to lend this
new half' of it to government if government would*secure to. the
bank anexclusive circulation of its notes. The statute of the sixth
of Anne, chapter 22, was accordirgly passed; which recites tbat
other persons and 'divers corporations haye presumed to :borrow
money, and to deal as a bank, contrary to former acts; and thereupon it is enacted, that "no corporation, or more than six persons
in partnership, shall borrow, owe, or take up any money on their
bills and notes, payable at demand, or at less than six months from
the borrowing.'
This 'provision has been often re-enacted, and
constitutes the banking privilege of the Bank of England. Competition was not feared from the circulation of'individual notes.
Hence individuals or partnerships of not more than six persons have
been at liberty to issue small notes, payable on demand; in other
words, notes for circulation. And we know that in the country
such notes have extensively circulated; but private bankers in London, in the, neighbourhood of the bank, though it was lawful, have
not found it useful to issue their own notes. So that the banking
privilege of the Bank of -England consisted simply in the privilege
of issuing notes for circulation, while that privilege is forbidden, by
law, to all other corporations, and all large partnerships and asso..
ciations.
This privilege was restrained, in 1826, so as not to prohibit banking companies, except within the distance of sixty-five miles of London; and, at the same time, notes of-the bank were made a tender
in payment of all debts,'except by the bank itself. This lirovision
may be considered as a new privilege; but it does not belong to the
original and essential-idea -ofbanking, Mr. M'Culloch remarks, and
truly, that all that government has properly to do with banks is
only so far as they are banks of issue. Upon the same principle
the banks of other countries of Europe are incorporated, with the
privilege to issue and circulate notes as their distinctive character.
Here Mr. Webster explained the character of the banks of France,
Belgium, &c.'
Now, how is it in our own country? When our state legislatures
have undertaken to restrain banking, the'great end in view has been
to prevent the circulation of notes. Mr. Webster here referred to
the statute books of Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, and New
Hampshire, for restraining' unauthorized companies frori issuing
notes of circulation. He then turned to the statute of Ohio, imposing
a punishment for unauthorized banking. Her law defines, in the
first p lace, what constitutes a bank, iz. the issuing of notes which
pass by delivery, and intended for circulation as cash. That, said
Mr. 'Webster, is the true definition of a bank, as we understand it,
in tlhis country. Mr. Webster referred also to the laws of other
Vr.XIII.-3 B

states, Maryland, New Jersey, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, all to the same
effect. The law of the state of Alabama herself, said he, is much
more important, in this view'of the case, than that of any other
state. The constitution of the state of Alabama was established in
1819; the law creating the bank of Alabama was passed in 1823.
The constitution and this law are all the authorities from which the
inference has been drawn of the policy of the state of Alabama.
Did she suppose that by this law she was establishing such a monopoly of the purchase of bills of exchange as has been contended for
in this case? Certainly not. For, by a law passed afterwards, she
restrained the circulation of unauthorized bank notes ; that is, noted
nt issued by some authorized banks. But did she also restrain
dealings in exchange? She did no such thing. Nor is there any
thing, either in the constitution or the laws of the state of Alabama,

which shows that by banking she ever meant more than the circulation of bills as currency. There is nothing therefore in any law or
*anypolicy Of Alalama, against the pirrchase of bills of exchange by
others as well as by-the Bank of Alabama. She has prohibited by
law other transactions which are clearly banking transac ions; but
she has not touched this. If even her banking policy includes as
well' buying exchange as circulation, and she guards against competition in the one, and leaves the other open, who can say, in the
face of such evidence, that it is her policy to guard against what she
leaves free and unrestrained ?
Is there any thing in the cbnstitution, or any ground in the legislation of Alabama, to sustain the allegation which has been made
of her policy? If not, is the existence of such a policy to be established here by construction, and that construction far-fetched ? I
Mr. Webster here rested his argument on this case, which, he
said, had been discussed by others so ably as not to justify his occupying the time of the Court by going further into it.
The learned counsel on the other side had, in the course of his
argument of yesterday, alluded to. the newspapers, which, he said,
had treated the decision of the Court below scornfully. Mr. Webster said he was sorry to hear it; for the learned judge had acted, in
his decision, he had no doubt, under a high sense of duty. I have
been told, said Mr. Webster, but I have not seen it, that a press in
this city, since this case has been under consideration in this Court,
has undertaken to speak, in a tone something approaching to that
of command, of the decision upon it to be expected from this Court.
Such conduct is certainly greatly discreditable to the character of the
country, as well as disrespectful and injurious to the Court.
A learned gentleman on the, other side said, the other day, that
he thought he might regard himself, in this cause, as having the
country for his client. He'only meant, doubtless, to express a strong
opinion that the interest'of the country required the case to be decided" in his favour. I agree with the learned gentleman, and I go
indeed far beyond him, in my estimate of the importance of this case

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

(Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

to the country. He did not take pains to show the extent of the evil
which would result from undoing. the vast number of contracts
which would be affected by the affirmation here of the judgment
rendered in the Court below, because his object did not require that:
his object was to diminish the prospect of mischief, not to enlarge it.
For myself, I see neither limit nor end to the calamitous consequences of such a decision. I do not know where it would not
reach, what interests it would not disturb, or how any part of the
commercial system of the country would be free from its influences,

direct or remote. And for what end is all this to be done? What
practical evil calls for so harsh, not to say so rash a remedy? And
why now, when existing systems and established opinions, When
both the law and public sentiment have concurred in what has been
found prhctically so safe and so useful; why now, and why here
seek to introduce new and portentous doctrines? If I were called
upon to : y what has struck me as most remarkable and Wonderful
in this whole case, I would,. instead of indulging in expletives, exaggerations, or exclamations, put it down as the most extraordinary
circumstance, that now, within a short month of the expiration of
the first half century of our existence under this Constitution, such
a question should have-been made; that now, for the first time, and
here, for the last place' on earth, such doctrines as have been heard
in its support should be brought forward. With all the respect
which I really entertain for the Court below, and for the arguments
which have been delivered here on the same side, I must say that,
in my judgment, the decision now under revision by this Court is,
in its principle, anti-commercial and anti-social, new and unheard
of in our system; and calculated to break up the harmony which
has so long prevailed among the states and people of this Union.
It is not, however, for the learned gentleman, nor for myself, to
say here that we speak for the country. We advance our sentiments
and our arguments, but they are without authority. But it is for
you, Mr. Chief Justice and judges, onthis, as on other occasions of
high importancs, to speak and to decide for the country. The
guardianship of her commercial interests; the preservation of the
harmonious intercourse of all her citizens; the fulfilling, in this
respect, of the great object of the Constitution, are in your hands;
and I am not to doubt that the trust will be so performed as to sustain at once high national objects and the character of this tribunal.
Mr. Ingersoll, for 'ne defendant, said that although distinct considerations of universal, of international, and of municipal, law are
involved in this case, he should not attempt to discriminate, but
submit them altogether. The judgment of the Circuit Court is
against the plaintiff's right of a ation. For that judgnment two distinct reasons are given, viz.: 1. That the law of Alabama excludes
banking in that state except as prescribed by its peculiar provisions;
and, 2. That besides that local law, the universal law excludes corporations not authorized by the legislative power of such states as

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

did not charter them. The first reason is enough to support the
judgment, without regard to the second, with which this Court is
not bound to concern itself. The corporation question, therefore, is
not necessarily in issue. It matters not what the rule of general
jurisprudence may be:as to corporations attempting extra-territorial
transactions, if the law of Alabama be that banking is prohibited in
that state, whether by corporations or individuals. The banking
question rules the case by the banking interdict, without reference
to the corporation question, on which the opposite argument has
spent itself in political denunciation. Alabama has a sovereign
right-to make banking an affair of state; and an unbroken series
of the uniform judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States
affirms not only that state right, but the obligation of this Court to
conform to it. Mr. Ingersoll then read the articles of the constitution of Alabama concerning banks, and an act of the assembly of
that state in 1836, by which the profits of banks are declared to be
the resource substituted for all other taxation of the state revenue;
and several passages of the case of the state of Alabama vs. Stebbins et al., Stewart's Alabama Reports, vol. i. 299; which he urged
as conclusive of the controversy. The constitution, legislation, and
adjudication of a sovereign state all unite in declaring that even its
own citizens shall not deal in banking, but agreeably to its peculiar
laws. The plaintiff bank had not in any respect conformed to those
laws. Consequently it cannot bank in Alabama, nor recover there
on a banking transaction there. The second reason of the Circuit
Court that corporations haVe no extra-territorial power may be
erroneous, and yet the plaintiff bank must fail for the first reason;
not because it is a corporation, but because it is a bank, no matter
where or whether incorporated, or partnership, br individual, or
even inhabitant and citizen of Alabama. It is enough that it
attcn-pted banking contrary to the local and peculiar law of Alabama. That settles the question, without involving it with corporation law. The Bank bf the United States vs. Deveaux, 5 Cranch,
61, falls under this principle too, because no citizens, including those
of Al'abama, can bank there contrary to its laws.
No comity interferes with this unquestionable principle. It is
the indisputable basis of uuiversal law, that laws have no force
beyond the territories of those Who make them. This is one of the
few principles of universal jurisprudence universally acknowledged.

was not binding here. The only force allowed to laws extra-territorially is derived from international comity,:which never intervenes
to set aside either the written law or the common law, or even the
state policy or state interest of another country. Henry, 2. Story's

The word in Huberus is "potestas," which Dallas translates *rights,
meaning as it does mean any species of right by written, common,
or even usage law ; for no such power or right of one state can by
comity be supplanted by the law of another state. Comitas inter
communitates is at most a frail and evanescent substitute for law.
Dallas translates it courtesy, and it is really nothing more. It is a
law of reciprocal necessity, of indispensable reciprocity, of absolute
charity to do as you would be done by; without which the harmony
of nations would be incessantly disturbed: but which, nevertheless,
is no more than the highest obligation of charity, to love our neighbours as we do ourselves, but not better +han ourselves, Its philosophy is well explained by Judge Story by a classical quotation in
his learned judgment in the case of Harvey vs. Richards, 1 Mason,
412; damus petimusque vicissim sub obtentu mutum necessitatis.
Unless, therefore, the state of Georgia needs such concession by
comity from the state of Alabama, she is not bound to make it.
One of the cases involving this question is brought here by the Carrollton Bank of Louisiana, the law of which state requires its judges
to refer in-their judgments to the written law of the state on which
the judgments are founded, and prohibits the judges from ever leaving the state whose boundaries are established by the Constitution.
How could the Courts of Alabama or any other state reciprocate
with Louisiana such regulations as these? In another 6f the cases,
the United States Bank of Pennsylrania is the plaintiff, which bank,
by the law of that state conferring its charter, is closely connected
with the canals, railroads, schools, and other improvements of Penns1vania. Could any stretch of comity give such provisions force
in Alabama? It is not judicial comity, but the comity of a state
which "ts Co tts of judicature award. Story's Conflict of Laws, p.
37, sec. 38. No Court therefore can allow it, but as the comity of
.the state, and not the Court. Comity, moreover, is international
courtesy; never allowed between provinces, districts, counties, cities,.
or other parts 6f the same empire. The connexion between these
United States is closer and more intimate than that of comity. Their
union by federal compact expressly settles the relation of the states
to cach other, and ,leaves no room for tacit or constructive comity
to operate. A national Constitution declares that no state shall
enter into any treoty, alliance, or confederation, or, without the
consent of Congress, into any agreement, or compact with another
state or foreign power.. Such union, with much providence and
some jealousy, has -settled the powers and relations of the respective
states. An artcle of the Constitution provides for the force and

proof of public acts of state, for the privileges and immunities of the
citizens of each state in all the rest, for fugitives from justice and
fugitives from labour leaving little or nothing on this important
subject to judicial construction. For certain purposes these United
States are one and the same, nation; for others, a quasi nation or
close confederation, and a'mere confederation, but still a national
confederation for all powers not delegated to them'by the people
and the states. According to the language of this Court, in 12
Peters, 720, the states are sovereign within themselves as to all the
powers iot granted to the United States, and foreign to each other
as to all others. The argument of the judge 'determining this ease
in the Circuit Court, denies the existence of any comity whatever
between these several states whose union constitutes a nation. Whether that argument be unquestionable or not, it is certain that their
union makes them a nation. In the opinion of Chancellor Kent,
lately published on this subject, a doubt is intimated, whether, as
the citizens of each state are entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states, it is competent to the state of
Alabama to prevent citizens of Georgia or Pennsylvania from banking in the former state. But this Court adjudged, in the Bank of
the United States vs. Devaux, 5 Cranch, 61, that no corporation is
a citizen; and it cannot be doubted that citizens of Georgia and
Pennsylvania are not entitled to more privileges and immunities in
Alabama than that state vouchsafes to its own citizens. That full
faith and credit shall be given to the acts and public proceedings
of the states in each other, seems to be as yet confined to judicial
acts, 3 Story's Commentaries, 174. Pennington vs. Townshend,
7 Wendall, 279. The laws of the different states are proved as
foreign laws in Courts of justice: and that it would lead to intolerable confusion to make by comity the laws of any state, the laws
of every other state, is demonstrated in Judge M'Kinley's argument
with a force which Chancellor Kent's opinion 'attempts in vain to
overthrow.
This is perhaps a question rather of politics than jurisprudence. It may be granted that states can re-enact each other's
laws, and so adopt them, but itis submitted as- clear that by no
agreement whatever can this be constitutionally effected. If then
no agreement of states can do it, it cannot be done by comity of
Courts; other ise construction would have more power than legislation. The question is not whether even one state, or the judicature of one state, can by comity adopt the law of another state; but
it is whether this great addition to the law of a state can be made
by the judiciary of the United States; not for the United States:
but whether the federal judiciary can by coniity incorporate the law
of one of these United States with that of another. It may be questioned whether the judiciary of the United States can reciprocato
comity with that of any foreign nation. All our federative law,
political, civil, penal, fiscal, martial, and whatever else there is, is
specific and written. There is no common law of the United States

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

but for principles and definitions. The admiralty law, though of
large scope, is by constitutional grant, and the revenue law is settled
by legislation. Could a Court of the United States reciprocate
admiralty or revenue law with England, France,or Mexico ?
Chancellor Kent alleges international law of merchants; but if
merchants may make laws for nations, so may mariners, travellers, or
borderer-s. If merchants by sea, why not traders ashore? Those of
New York and Liverpool have no better right to supersede the treaty
making authority by their own tacit understanding, than the traders
who fetch peltries from the north or metals from the south. The
borderers of the St. Lawrence, the Sabine, and the Arkansas may
arrange rude international codes with Canada, Mexico, and Texas
for the go'vernment of these United States, usurping the powers of
constituted authorities, as ex parte professional opinions may usurp
those of appointed judicature. There is no occasion for any such
irregularities. Every state of the United States has its all-sufficient
common law and frequent legislatipn; while the law-making power
and the law-judging department of the Union are in constant being,
rendering it wholly unnecessary for illegitimate usage, action, or
habit, partial, personal, and selfish substitutes, to take the place of
deliberate law-making. It is at least doubtful whether either the
federal or even the state judiciary of these United States has the
power to make laws by comity. At all events it is a perilous faculty
by comity to make common law for one state from the written law
of another ; and granting that state Courts may exercise such l'uris.
diction by no means infers that the federal judiciary may do it for
the states. For this Court to introduce a Georgia or Pennsylvania
bank into Alabama, wouid be more than the legislature of that state
can -do for its own citizens, except as its peculiar constitutions allow.
Introducing or changing law is -often a serious measure. - It'is the
direst exercise of conquest, and -the most difficult. Diversities of
laws, language, and local sympathies are the ways of God to man,
without which all nations would strive to have but one local habitation and one name. Droit d'aubaine,'British allegiance, the land,
exclusive law of the common law, all such eemingly severe and
harsh provisions are pregnant with the philosophy of providence.
A learned foreign lawyer, M. de Tocqueville, vol. i. 99, considers
these United States so many foreign nations, whose whole form the
Union, of which originally, even every township was a sort of independent sover6ignty. Nothing like law can be more foreign than
that of Massachusetts and Louisiana to each other. It may be
politic, it may be wise to try to abolish or mitigate these estrangemeats of locality: but it is no more practicable to extirpate them
than the barbarisms of war. This Court has. strenuously adjudged
that at any rate such is not the judicial function. It does not and
will not anticipate or fabricate legislation.
Furthermorp: the objection to Courts extending comity for states
to banks is corroborated by the consideration that banking is a sovereign privilege. Making money, or a substitute for it, is of sove-

reign faculty. Wilson vs. Spence, 1 Randolph, 100. Pennington vs.
Townsend, 7 Wend. 276.
Mr. Ogden cites The People vs. Utica, 15 Johnson, for Chief Justice Thomson's allegation that banking was not a franchise at common law, But of what banking is that allegation made? Banking
by deposite, by discount, or by circulation? If the latter, it is expressly contradicted by Judge Roane and the Virginia Court, as it
is believed to be by all the authors on political economy. In the
case of Drew vs. Swift, in the Pennsylvania circuit, it was adjudged
by Mr. Justice Baldwin that banking by circulation is money making,
and part of the public authority. Be this as it may as a general
principle, Alabama has settled it by her organic law. So adjudged in
The State vs. Stebbins, 1 Stewart, 299. If it were res integra, it might
well be questioned whether'any state can devolve on individuals
this sovereign authority. It was so questioned on demurrer, in
Tennessee. Peck's Reports, 269. Without now attempting that
perhaps foreclosed position, it is submitted that no state Court, much
less a Court of the United States, can inflict on one state the banking sovereignty of another state. No comit? can do that. It would
be servitude. Otherwise the taxation, hostilities, and all other exigencies of one state or nation may be adjudicated upon another.
Even if there were no law of Alabama to forbid it, the flagrant impolicy is patent. Story's Conflict, 33. The banks of Europe and
Asia, the laws of Mexico and Texas, the abolition acts of Pennsylvania, the English common law, which in Massachusetts, ipso facto
emancipates a slave, the church laws, laws of royal prerogative and
of noblemen's privileges, might all be enforced in Alabama. There.
must be some stop to such endless and insufferable confusion-such
chaos 'of government. 'The only question is, what branch of go.
vernment shall interpose: and Judge Story's valuable work on the
conflict of laws is explicit that in France, England, and this country,
the judiciary is that branch, without awaiting written laws of direction. Story's Conflict, 24, 25. This Court has always asserted the
necessity and duty of Courts to refuse their aid to acts contrary to
the policy of law. Armstrong vs. Toler, II Wheat. 270. United
States vs. Owen, 2 Peters, 527. Nor is there any inconsistency in
Courts enforcing the exclusion, and yet not the comity, because the one
is compliance with law, whereas the other is to make it. Finally, to
doubt whether comity is due is to resolve that it is not, under such a
government as ours,wherethejudicialpoweris so specific and defined.
Mr. Ogden finally denies the right of Alabama to meddle, with
bills of exchange, which are the means of commerce, and commerce
with all its regulations have beun surrendered by the states to the
Union. But no bill of exchange is here in question as a conmercial mean, more than a ferry boat, a horse, an ass, a slave, a man
or woman, or any other commercial convenience; and it will not
be pretended that these are not under state regulation. New
York has regulated money by a small bill law, and money, more
than bills of exchange, is the ntedium of commerce. All the state&,

[Bank of AuguSta vs. Earle.]

have by law regulated the: damages on bills of exchange. The
argument proves' too much, and therefore nothing. As to the
ruinous consequences denounced, Mr. Ingersoll said that such had
always been augured, and always would be, of measures offensive
to certain political prejudices., They wele abundantly disproved
by the improvement and prosperity of the country. The Court,
instead of being alarmed from its duty by such appeals, should feel
encouraged to support the laws of state sovereignty; which, well
understood, were the broad foundations of the general welfare.
Neither man nor state can stand erect without these self-preserving
rights; against which the pleas of comity and cries of politics are
equally futile and unavailing in this Court as now constituted.
As it is impossible to foresee what may be the views of the
Court, it is an advQcate's duty to consider all the reasons given for
the judgment below ; and, therefore, the corporation question must
next be examined.. The Court will remark, that it is not a question
of action, but of transaction. The record presents the case of an
incorporated bank, by its stationary agent resident in Alabama,
with the funds of the bank discounting there a bill of exchange;
upon which transaction this action was instituted. It is thus no secondary contract; but a primary, actual dealing by the corporation
in banking business out of the state which clartered the banking
corporation. The right of suit is not to be confounded with. the
right of contract. They are obviously distinguishable. Perhaps
American State Courts have sanctioned the right of action, which
it is not intended either to concede or to draw in question. The
cases of the Portsmouth Company, t0 Mass. Rep. 91-; The Silver
Lake Bank, 4 Johns. Chan. Reps, 370; of the New York Fireman's
5 Con.

Society, 2 Gallison, i05, and
8 Wheaton, 454; Green vs. Minnis, 1 M'Cord, 80, and the various

foreign authorities cited in the opposite argument; may perhaps establish the law that a corporation or sovereignty enjoys the right of
suit in other Courts than those of its own state. I is ievertheless
worthy of remark, that no case is to be found in the English books,
of a corporation suing in England upon a contract there. All the
volumes of English law may be challenged for such a case. The case
of the Dutch West India Company, in Ray mona and Strange was suit
upon a lawful contract, that is, a contract in the country where the
company had a right to contract, so that the lex loci never csime in
question during the suit in England, and when an attempt was made
to plead it into the suit, that attempt was frustrated by estoppel,
The English chancery cases of suits by foreign sovereigns, are distinguishable from suits by foreign corporations; because the sovereign sued in them as an individual divested of the privileges of
intangibility.

SUPREME COURT.
"(Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

vS. The Washington Insurance, Company, from 6 Johnsoh's Reports, cited to.how that this question was not raised on that occasion, abounds with "demonstration that it was against the interest
of both parties to make it; and in the cases of the Silver Lake and
Marietta Banks, the most eminent lawyers of New York and Virginia denied the right of action, which, a multo fortiori, argues contradictioh of the right of transaction. Mr. Ogden's. notion of the
venue, at any rate, a Very little technicality upon which to build so
important a position, is annulled by a law of Alabama, which prohibits all special demurrers, so that no averment of venue is necessary in their declarations, and rarely occurs.
-Thequestion thus freed frqm mere fiction, and the right of action, is
broadly whether corporations can contract and enforce their contracts
by suit in foreign countries. To discriminate between right and remedy, is always ma tter of some difficultyas this Court experienced in
Ogden vs. Saunders, 12 Wheaton. Yet the distinction is well known
and universally recognised; the right of remedy being regulated by the
law of the forum,'whereas, the legality of the-contract is determined
by the law of the place. In most of the Courts of civilized countries,
there is little restriction upon the right~of *action. ' In great Britain
and this country, all Courts are open to all persons, upon .principles
of wise jurisprudence, well explained in the eighty-second number
of the Federalist , that foreigners as ifell as citizens, the poor and
the rich, the incorporated and the individual, have all an equal and
unquestionable right to judicial redress for alleged wrong. The
Courts of France will not take jurisdiction of a suit between two
foreigners, but renvoy them to their-own courts- at home. But it is
the privilege of every complainant to bring suit in any English or
American Court upon all lawful contracts. The contract must be
lawful, however, that is to say,'must conform to the- law of the
place of contract. Place, therefore, settles the right, while Courts
regulate the remedy.
Our question is, whether the incorporation of one state or-country
is such in all others? which. is denied. What is a corporation?
Mr. Ogden's definition is perfectly acceptable for the defendant's
argument; he defines it, an artificial person created by the- law
of an independent state. The definition or description, accurately
made, tends much to explain the reason of the thing and to elucidate the subject. It is an artificial body :-Ayliff calls it a mystical
body, a mere creation of the law, with none but express powers ad
hoc, or such' implied powers as are strictly indispensable. Judge
M'Kinley treats the matter with exemplary accuracy, when he says,
that unless the act of incorporati6n by Georgia, Louisiana, or Pennsylvania, can operate as strict law in Alabama, it is of no force
there whatever. Such is the true starting point of the whole discussion. All the authorities 'of all 'countries and ages concur in this
fundamental doctrine of corporations., Brooke, Coa-n'. Bacon,

Daudridge, 12 Wheat. 638. Beatty vs. Knowles, 4 Peters, 167-168It is beyond question that corporation authority is a license to be
strictly construed. Chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries, says, this
is modern doctrine. Yet on the same page, he mentions Trajan's
letter to Pliny, which strongly asserts it; and the fact is, that from Solon
and Numa, whose laws on the subject he also refers to, down to Marshall, the late much honoured Chief Jistice of this Court; who was
a uniform and inflexible supporter of the strict construction of cqrporation powers; it has always been the same, and necessarily must
be so, because charters take franchises or privileges from all tozoanfer upon a few, which franchises or privileges must. needs bIe restricted to their ver.y capitulation. An individual power of attorney
or substitution is never expanded by construction. 'All letters of
license are taken strictly, though their interpretation is but matter
of intention, whereas that of a charter preseiits a question of state
power which Courts have no authority to enlarge constructively.
It may, indeed, be asked, what is mean- by modern corpQration
law? What is the American law of charters? Who made it?
When? Where? Is it English common law? or conimon civil
law? from which code all the law of charters proceeds.' Is the
American law on this subject ante-revolution or post-revolution ?
Do we get it from Massachusetts or Loisliana, where the common
English law and the common civil law respectively prevail? (oR is
the modern law of Massachusetts enforced in Virginia as common
law there, as Was adjudged in Dandridge's case? Chancellor Kent
says, 2 Con q,81, that corporations have multiplied with a flexibility
and variety unknown to the common law, But what is the American common law of corporations? The United States having no
common law, what is their standard? In all the states formed out
of Louisiana, with the civil law as their birthright, corporators are
personally answerable for corporate acts. In states inheritink the
English common law, they are, ,perhaps, personally intangible ; not
by the terms of a chartei or by any written law, but because it is
understood that the English common law annexes such privilege of
exemption. A state grants a charter, to which the common law
tacitly annexes an inestimable privilege. Has this English common
law been adopted in the AmericaU states? Is it consonant with
their policy or conformable to their constitutions ? At the period of
their independence, there were few if any corporations, and no
banking corporations in America. Has that universal public sentimeut, which gradually frames common law, since then engrafted
this-privilege upon the corporation stock, which till long after the
American revolution had not begun to germinate, antq only within a
very few years last past. has attained a growth which overshadows
all 6ur ingtitutdons? The source of this immense power it is hard to
find; but, at all,'events, the stream has been uniform in the channel
of the. Supremrn'ourt of the, United States, coincident with those

576

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]
principles of law; which, whether ancient or modern, are equally
unquestionable in their authority and their reason. In some of the
latter cases of this Court, The Columbia Bank, 7 Cranch, 299, the
Bank of the United States, 8 Wheaton, 338, and the same bank, 12
Wheat. 68, in the absence of some of the judges, and Chief Justice
Marshall earnestly dissentient in the last mentioned case, whose
principles rule the whole doctrine, it was declared by the eminent
judge who delivered the Court's opinions, that the common law of corporations has been broken in upon by modern adjudications; as it
has been declared by another distinguished commentator, that the
common law was found impolitic in this respect, and essentially discarded.
It is true, that in order tb keep pace with the modern flocci of
these asociations, the common law, with its characteristic adaptation to exigencies, has counteracted their intolerable privilege by
holding them to personal liability. But .no other change than this,
it is apprehended, will be-found in the modern common law of either
this country or England. Power tb pronounce it impolitic, to, break
in upon or discard it, if it exists in any Court, should be very
sparingly exercised. All the English cases are irt
2. Kent, 289. 292.
and Angel and Ames, 128; and their uniform tendency is to keep
down corporation privilege, hot to exaggerate it. And the same is
the resuli of any thorough examination of all the American cases.
Corporations have not been allowed to escape suit by undue privilege ; which is the substance of all that salutary change in the law,
that is supposed to discard it, as impolitic, or break in upon it as antiquated. Itis ,adaptation, not alteration of the common law. No
principle 6f corporation law is invoked for this defence, but such as
,he late Chief Jtstice vf thig Court always- abided by. His.anxious
dissent in "12 Wheaton, sets forth those principles with a reviewir of
the.-accrediteA authorities from Brooke to. Blackstone,; while the
learneL judge who delivered the opinion of the majority 6f the
Court, appeals to h recent dictum of Mt. Justice Bailey, and the still
later. doctrines of Chief Justice Parker, for a common law of corporations in Virginia, transported from Massachusetts.
Gradual and cautious conformity to circumstances is the merit of the
common law, following the universal sense of propriety; for substantial law is eterunal and identical, and what is frequently-derounced as
disorganization, is, in truth, restoration of first principles. The great
duty of Courts is to maintain them, and It was no doubt the solemn
determination of Chief Justice Marshall to uphold even those seeming formalities of corporation law, which experience had sanctioned
as wise. His forecast in this is proved on this occasion. The seal,
the regular vote, the record,. the dulkr constituted agent, and other
philosophical guards of this formidable imperrum in'imperi6o cannot
b, dispensed -with, without enablinga vast engine of factitious wealth

and indispensable propriety. Legislation and adjudication have
never gainsaid it. Judge M'Kinley cites Chief Justice Parsons, for
a solemn warning against constructive encroachment. Even granting the 'policy, where is the judicial power? No corporation is
created, in contemplation of laW, but for the public good. Charters
are intended to benefit the unincorporated more than the incorporated. Legislatures and states organize them on no other principle;
and Courts carry it into practice by restricting the grant to its letter,
and, if indispensable, moulding common law to countervail privilege. Hence Coke's -Institute, and the case in Cowper, declare crporations to be inhabitants that they may not'evade taxation; while
this Court denies that they arecitizens, in order to prevent undue
privilege of suit. 5 Cranch, 61. Hence numerous adjudications,
individuating corporations for suit, not one of which designs to extend intangibility. U. States vs. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392. Farmers'
Bank of Delaware, 12 Peters, 135.
Any judicial extension of charter exemption by construction,
would not be in harmony with common law, which is general
assent; while every sound judicial limitation of such exemption
effectuates the common will. A few may contend otherwise; but
it is impossible that they can make law. All. its established principles limit corporation power, and facilitate common right. Even the
formalities of law are often its necessary solemnities..It might be
sometimes convenient to suitors and judges for the latter to adjudicate at their meals, or in bed; but open Courts and formal proceedings are obviously essential. The great attempt of those who deny
and would discard-the settled laws of corporations is, first, to assimilate them to persons, and, secondly, to partilers, or othey associations of persons not incorporated. But they are neither for aggravation of exemption: they may resemble either for personal liability.
This Court has adjudged that they are not persons. 12 Peters, 99,
100. And the very reverse is the reason of the law. Whenever
impersonated it is to restrain, not to license them. A corporation
chnnot, like a person insolvent, make art assignment of its affairs.
12 Peters, 138, -Even if so authorized by charter, it cannot assign
them to foreign trustees. Williams vs. Maus, 6 Watts, 278. Can a
corporation do any act of humanity-? Certainly not, though the munificence of such acts daily stifles the sense, of their illegality. It is
as much a de-vastavit for the trustees or. directors of a corporation to
spend its means generously, as it would be for an executor or administrator. It is not the law that a.corporation is a person capable
like an individual of action and transaction. 2 Kent, 267. 299. 2,79.

VOL. XIII.--3.C

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.)

An American person is a sovereign, restrained by no fetters but of
his .own making. A corporation is his creature, bound by strict
obligation. Persons may traffic everywhere: but why? Because
they become subjects wherever they are. But corporations are
amenable only to the state creating them. The European, Asiatic,
or African, is an American, in America; whereas the perverse argument of corporation license is to be a citizen without being a subject;
while all natural persons are subjects, even though not citizens. Personal identity, corporeal being, and powers of motion, are the attributes of-persons, but not of corporations. They are personal for
legal responsibility, but plural for the enjoymnent of privilege.
Still less is the attempted resemblance of corporations to partners.
In the Law Reporter, 59, this resemblance is strongly asserted. But
the want of it is so palpable that a single reference to the distinction
is enough. Ang. and Am. 23. Corporationsare neither persons nor
partners, but artificial bodies politic, created by act of state, always
ad hoc, and their franchises are granted for public good, of which
they are the supposed instruments. Charter elements are artificial
creations, with none but express or severely indispensable power,
indispensable to existence, without existence till allowed by the
state, mostly assigned to a place, always confined to defined purposes. Whether, and how agencies for corporations can be constituted is questionable. 2 Kent, 291, 292, in note. But an inflexible and
fundamental doctrine prevents their extra-territorial transactions, by
requiring the permission of the state wherever such transaction is; in
which doctrine the question of agency is merged and d-isappears.
In this plain principle all authorities agree. 2 Kent, 268, 269. 276.

Ang. and Am. 27. 37, 38. The civil law, the common law, American
law, all law coincides in it. Not a case or sentence can be cited
against it. A corporation must be authorized by the sovereignty
where it acts as such, otherwise it is what is called an adulterine
corporation. Ang. and Am. 38. Mr. Ogden's definition acknowledges this; and-he conceded that it cannot perform corporate acts
beyond the state creating it. This is the explanation of Chief Baron
Manwood's quaint notion, that corporations have no souls because
they are created by the king. They are creations of law, and do not
share in government or any political power. Per Marshall, Chief
Justice, 4 Wheat. 636.' No corporation is such, it has no creation or
legal being, till authorized by the government of the state where it
is to act as a corporate body. Greystock College case, Jenk. 205.
Dyer, 3. 60. 6 Vin. Abr. 287. Ang. and Am. 38, note 5. This
ancient judgment, contains the germ of the whole self-protecting
principle of sovereignties against corporations. The pope foundedGreystock bollege, and it existed for a long time. But the English
Courts, as soon as it appeared before them, annulled it for want of
lawful beginning. Such is the universal law applicable to these
bodies politic. Sutton's Hospital, Jenk. 270. Courts may have suffered them to sue abroad on contracts at home which are lawful;

there. Whenever this position against them is taken in a-Court, it
is insuperable. A charter, if required, must be proved before any
corporate act can be even given in evidence. United States vs.

Johns, 4 Dal. 415. Bul. N. P. 107. 10 Mass. 91. 8 Johns. 295.

and Am. 377.
The universal common law of all sovereign states requires,
and uniformly asserts this self-protecting principle.
It is a
state right of indispensable recognition. None but the state can
legitimate a corporation. In Pennsylvania, the legislature have
authorized the Supreme Court to create charitable, religious, and
literary corporate bodies, on certain terms, as in England the king
deputes persons to grant charters.. Ang. and Am. 44. But state
agency, sovereignty permission, is sine qua non. But it is said that.
sovereigns may sue abroad. True, they do, but not as sovereigns.
When the King of Spain sued in the Circuit Court of Pennsylvania,
he was, liable to costs, or to nonsuit; and when his minister, Don
Onis waived his privilege as a foreign ambassador to become a witness on the trial, he might have been prosecuted for perjury, or
committed for contempt. When a sovereign sues abroad, he becomes subject to the foreign jurisdiction, which corporations never
do;.and when sovereigns ste in equity, especially, the fullest reaction
and reciprocity of responsibility necessarily ensue. It will not be
pretended, that a monarch of England brings his privilege of irresponsibility, or the Sultan of Turkey his despotic power, when condescending to sue in this country. As monarchs they have no power
here whatever; and they sue, like all others subject to our Courts.
It has been made a question, too, whether upon the principles
contended for, the American states, being, as was alleged, corporations, can, as they constantly do, borrow money, sell stocks,
and otherwise transact business in foreign countries ; to which the
obvious answer is, that on all such occasions they deal as sovereign
states, and not mere, corporations. Chancellor Kent, in his published
opinion, relies on the United States Bank having been permitted to
sue in state Courts. But this right was denied in Virginia, and this
Court has determined that that bank had no right to the federal
forum but by express act of Congress. 5.Cranch, 61. Right of suit,
at any rate, is not right of contract.
It being thus shown indisputably that no corporation can exist
but by express permission of that state in which it acts as such,
it follows, as a matter of course, that it -is no corporation at all
until allowed by the state in which it acts. Chancellor Kent perverts this principle, by asserting that a corporation may contract
abroad until forbidden there; the true principle being, as asserted
by Chief Justice Marshall in the case of the Providence Bank,
that the act creating a. corporation is an enabling act, by which
alone'it is enabled to contract. 2 Cranch, 167-169. This simple
and incontestable position covers the whole ground. It is part
of universal jurisprudence, aUd parcel of all'politics. Corpora-

tions are creations of municipal law, having no existence or power
$o contract whatever, until enabled so to do 'b a 16w, or other
legitimate 'ermission of the' sovereignty wherever acting. Especially is this conservative principle indispensable as an undelegated
right of these United States. Otherwise the smallest member of this
Union may legislate for, and govern all the rest. In the case of the
Marietta Bank, 2 Rand. 465, the Court explained this principle
with great force of argument; much more, it is apprehended, than
is displayed by the contrary view, in Chancellor Kent' opinion, or
has been urged in this Court.
These United States, as such, can have no privatd corporation;
and if, upon false notiohs of commercial intimacy, they are to be

"coneolidated by traders, corporations, and professional dogmas, contrary to the true spirit of our political institutions, not only the rights
of all the states, but Ahe federal Constitution itself will be at -an end.
Upon the plea of international commercial law, a bank of the United
-States might branch, not only in every state, but every county of
every state in the Union; and, indeed, so may every state bank. It
is confidently submitted to this Court, that it will best fulfil its duties
by holding the states united by sovereign ties, by the states remaining sovereign, and corporations remaining subject;,not by sovereign
corporations and subject states.
The state of Alabama cannot apply the common law of G'eorgia
or of Pennsylvania to determine controversies- 96ch as this. It
cannot ascertain, by any accredited rules of interpretation, what
may have been the intention of another state in creating a corporation. which is responsible for misconduct only to the state creating it. and cannot be reached in the foreign state where it coatracts. Every charter involves questions of political -advantage,
regarding which no state looks beyond itself, but :imply to its own
good, of which no foreign Court can judge. All a Court can do is
to ascertain the will of its own government; and if it find that that
government has not sanctioned the corporation, by expiess authority
fox that state, then such corporation cannot be acknowledged by the
Court. It is no corporation before.that Coflrt, -Its charter may be
proved there, as it must be, before it isdin evidence there. But,
when proved, even though it may have a right of action there , it
has no right of contract in that state, till authorized by it to contract
there. If Courts are bound by common law to restrict corporations
to the specific pifrposes of their creation, they are bound by the
same commion law to prevent their wandering out of place, as much
as out of purpose. 2. Kent, 299, note E. Charters are special and untransferible trusts, to be executed as
when and where prescribed, which trusts have no extra-erritorial
existence. If they act by agent beyond the chartering state, the trust
is defrauded and annulled, without-responsibility of the agent to the
chartering state,- or of the corporation to the foreign state. No state
can, even by act of assembly, raise an ,executor, administrator, or
other trustee in anolher state. The states of Georgia, Louisiana, and
Pennsylvania, could not incend by thege bank charters to make laws

for the state of Alabama, It is impossible in legal, contemplation so
to consider it. Can then the interposition of a, questionable agency
supply a power, which not only never was intended to be given, but
which could not be given even if intended? Otherwise, all corpor4tions ihay by agencies act everywhere. The colleges of New England may make masters of arts in the southern states, and the
southern states may introduce societies for establishing slavery in
the north. Not only so, but Europe, Asia, Africa, even Australasia,
Mexico, or Texas, may regulate the United States of America.
In Dandridge's case, 12 Wheat., Chief Justice Marshall, after explaining the supposed changes of the Common law respecting corporations, denies that what he calls the talisman of construction has
yet quite dissolved the whole fabric of deep-rooted and venerable
jurisprudence. The old rule, for which on that occasion he fell into
a minority of this Cou't, if preserved, as he insisted, would prevent
all extra-territorial corporation power; and the confusion which if
suffered it will be sure to inflict on the nationality of the country.
The legal analogies are abundant and unquestionable. Executors,
administrators, and guardians have no authority beyond the states
creating them. 1 Cranch, 92. 1 Dallas, 45B. 2 Mass. 384. 3 Mass.

Corporations are municipal creations of states and creatures
of common law. But, a has already-been questioned, what is
that law? If English, it is adopted only as adapted here; and
what is that in Alabama-a state not yet twenty years old? This
is, probably, the first occasion when the elements of corporation
law in that state have come to be ascertained. Is it Roman, English,. or American-? No instance has occurred, probably, before
ot a foreign corporation attempting by resident agency to deal
in Alabama. We are brought then at last to the question, whether
an incorporated bank can enjoy there privileges and immunities
denied to the citizens of that state. The only adjudications in point
are, Beattie vs. Knowler, 4 Peters, 167, 168; and The Marietta
Bank, 2 Rand. 465; the argumbnt of the Virginia Court in the
latter; the judgment, as well as the argument of this Court in the
former. The act of the state of Ohio is likewise full to the point, as
a practical recognition of the law. The cases sustaining snits on contracts in the states creating the corporations are no contralictions of
these two cases
The only pertinent English case, in Lord Raym.
and Strange, has been explained. The case of the Propagation
Society vs. Wheeler, in 8 Wheat. 464, was no more than a question
of suit. The Greystock College case, that of The Bank of Marietta,
and Beatty vs. Knowler, are coincident acknowledgments of the
great principle, that a corporation has no corporate power beyond
the state to which it owes being In the earnest and sincere advocacy of that principle of universal, international, and municipal law,
Mr. Ingersoll said he felt cheered by the assurance that his country
is his client.
Mr. Vande Gruff, for J. B. Earle, one of the defendants in error;
stated that the act of the legislature of Alabama, which declared the
statutes of the state in force as they are contained in Aikin's Digest,
provides that all statutes, laves, and parts of laws, not included in
the Digest, are repealed. This repealed the act of 1827 relative to
banking; and other laws on the same subject. This act was passed
in 1832. A.ikin~s Digest, 301. There is another act of the legislature of Alabama, which makes bills of exchange and promissory
notes negotiable, a'nd declares them to be prima facie evidence of
consideration. Aikin's Digest, 327.
Two questions have been agitated in these causes. One may
not be necessary to their decision. The question of comity may
be one which on.general principles may embarrass. It is believed
that comity between nations is as necessary to their intercourse,
as our breath is to our existence; but it is not understood how
it is to be limited. Is a law of Pennsylvania to be applied over the
whole world? The rule that corporations have not an extra,-

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]
terrtorial existence is established: but the principles which are
claimed on the part of the plaintiffs in error, would kiv, a universal
existence and unlimited privileges to such institutions.
The general rule is, that the laws of a particular state have
Withority only within the territory of the state; and he exception
tW the rule prevails only, when the laws have been adopted in a
foreign, or another state or country. I •this principle is correct, it
will be the duty of the counsel for the plaintiff in error, to show that
the law of Pennsylvania incorporating the United States Bank is a
law which has been adopted in the state of Alabama.
A railroad company may buy iron abroad, for the purpose of con9trueting their railroad at home. This appears to be a contract
which will be sustained by the comity of nations. It presents a
different question from this; which is, whether the United States
Bank of Pennsylvania can go abroad to do acts which are only
authorized in the state.
It would be disastrous to say a corporation cannot go out of Alabama to buy paper to be used in its operations at home. But this
is a different case from authorizing a corporation to carry on the
business for which it was incoiporated in Pennsylvania, out of that
state. Could a bank of the state of Pennsylvania go to Mobile, and
carry on the business of banking there, to the injury of the domestic
banks?, The rule of comity has never been applied so as to allow
it to interfere with all the laws of a state: its application has ever
and only been to particular cases.
If a Court has declared that the rule of comity does not apply in
a particular case, there is a final adjustment of the question as to
the force of the foreign law in that case; and the question is settled
by the decision of the Court. No cases which have been cited for
the plaintiffs in error, show that by the laws or the decisions of the
Courts of Alabama, corporations have extra-territorial powers or
privileges. The case 'of the Marietta Bank, decided inVirginia,
and reported in 2 Rand. Rep., shows that comity in favour of corporations does not exist. This is evidence that there is no general
law which allows the existence of corporations, out of the state in
which they are chartered.
All the questions of- the rights of corporations to go abroad to
borrow money, do not apply to the case before the Court. Those
corporations borrow money to enable them to transact and carry on
the business for which they were incorporated at home.
The inquiry is, whether the United States Bank of the state ot
Pennsylvania could go into Alabama, and there carry on the .business
of banking. The legislature of Alabama would, in positive terms,
have refused this privilege, if it had been applied for. A judge in
Alabama, knowing this, should have felt himself bound by his judicial duties to apply a principle which would have been applied by
the legislature.
. Is it reasonable, that if large profits are to be made in Alabama,
that.a part of these profits should not be paid to the state of Alabama,
---for the, privilege of carrying on banking? This is just, and it haa

been
from
their
In

the course of legislation in all the states to receive a bonus
banking corporations, or to claim a portion of the profits of
operations on granting charters of incorporation.
England corporations can only exist by prescription, or be

established by grants from the king, or legislative enactment.
Could a foreign corporation go to England, and carry on its business
there, until it should be expressly excluded by the decision of a
Court, or by an act of Parliament ?
Another point in this case is to be regarded. The act of the
legislature of Pennsylvania establishes the United States Bank at
Philadelphia, and authorizes branches in the state. The law gives
it no powers to be exercised out of the state. This is a sufficient
eVidence of the restrictior! of its existence to the state of Pennsylvania.
As to that feature in the case before the Court, which depends
on the existing constitution and laws of Alabama, prohibiting banking,, the Court will be obliged to decide what banking is. Th,
agreed case 'shows that a part of the capital of the bank was transferred to Alabama to buy bills of exchange; and the questio.i is.
whether buying bills of exchange is banking.
Discounting bills and notes, and receiving money on deposit, are
not exclusively banking. Every bank, at the time of the incorporation of the State Bank 'of Alabama, dealt in bills of exchange.
The object of the charter of the bank was to include the discounting
and purchase of bills of exchange, as a part of the opetations of the
bank. The bank was to haVe every opportunity of making profits
which any other bank possessed.
It is not necessary to go into the question of the rights of indi,
viduals to purchase bills of exchange. The question before the
Court is, whether foreign corporations have such rights. Speculations on the rights of individuals only embarrass the case. To show
that the dealing in bills of exchange is banking, Mr. Vande Gruff
cited Postlethwait's Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce, titles Discount, Banking. 15 Johns. Rep. 390. Tomlin's
Law Dictionary, title Bank.
How can the plaintiff say the purchase of bills of exchange is not
banking, when the law of their existence gives them no other
powers but those of a bank. They are here found remitting their
funds of the bank to Alabama to buy bills. Can they say this is
not a banking operation ? It was the object of the act incorporating'
the bank to give it the advantages of buying bills of exchange,
which' composes a large part of the profits of banking operations;
and this is precisely what they have done in the case before the
Court. The constitution of Alabama on this subject should receive
a liberal construction, as the whole support of the government of
Alabama is derived from the banking operations of the state banks.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.
These three cases involve the same principles, and have been

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

585

[Bank of Augpita vs. Earle.]

brought before us by writs of error directed to the Circuit Court
and southern district of Alabama. The two first have been fully
argued by counsel; and the last submitted to the Court upon the
arguments offered in the other two. There are some shades of difference in the facts as stated in the different records, but none that
can affect the decision. We proceed therefore to express our opinion
on the first case argued, which was the Bank of Augusta v8. Joseph
B. Earle, The judgment in this case must decide the others.
The questions presented to the Court arise upon a case stated in
the Circuit Court in the following words:"The defendant defends this action upon the following facts, that
are admitted by the plaintiffs: that plaintiffs are a corporation,
incorporated by an act of the legislature of the state of Georgia,
and have power usually conferred upon banking institutions, such as
to purchase bills of exchange, &c. That the bill sued on was made
and endorsed, for the purpose of being discounted by Thomas
M'Gran, the agent of said bank, who had funds of the plaintiffs in
his hands forr the purpose of purchasing bills, which funds were
derived from bills and notes discounted in Georgia-by said plaintiffs,
and payable in Mobile; and the said M'Gran, agent as aforesaid,
did so discount and purchase the said bill sued on, in the city of
Mobile, state aforesaid, for the benefit of said bank, and with their
funds, and to remit said funds to the said plaintiffs.
If the Court shall say that the facts constitute a defence to this
action, judgment will be given for the defendant, otherwise for
plaintiffs, for the amount of the bill, damages, interest, and cost;
either party to have the right of appeal or writ of error to the
Supreme Court upon this statement of facts, and the judgment
thereon."
Upon this statement of facts the Court ga~Ve judgment for the
defendant; being of opinion that a bank incorporated by the laws
of Georgia, with a power among other things to purchase bills of
exchange, could not lawfully exercise that power in the state of
Alabama; and that the contract for this bill was therefore void, and
did not bind the parties to the payment of the money.
It will at once be seen that the questions brought here for decision
are of a very grave character, and they have received from the
Court an attentive examination. A multitude of corporations for
various purposes have been chartered by the several states; a large
portion of certain branches of business has been transacted by incorporated companies, or through their agency; and contracts to a
very great amount have undoubtedly been made by different corporations out of the jurisdiction of the particular state by which
they were created. In deciding the case before us, we in effect
determine whether these numerous contracts are valid, or not. And
if, as has been argued at the bar, a corporation, from its nature and
character, is incapable of making such contracts; or if they are
inconsistent with the rights and. sovereigfity of the states in which
they are made, they cannot be enforced in the Courts of justice.
74

5S6

SUPREME COURT.

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]
Much of the argument has turned on the nature and extent of
the powers which belong to the artificial being called a corporation;
and the rules of law by which they are to be measured. On the
part of the plaintiff in error, it has been contended that a corporation
composed of citizens of other states are entitled to the benefit of that
provision in the Constitution of the United States which declares
that "The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges
and immunities of citizens in the several states;" that the Court
should look behind the act of incorporation, and see who are the
members of it; and, if in this case it should appear that the corporation of the fBank of Augusta consists altogether of citizens of the
state of Georgia, that such citizens are entitled to the privileges and
immunities of citizens in the state of Alabama: and as the citizens
of Alabama may unquestionably purchase bills-of exchange in that
state, it is insisted that the members of this corporation are entitled
to the same privilege, and cannot be deprived of it even by express
provisions in the Constitution or laws of the state. The case of the
Bank of the United States vs. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 61, is relied on
to support this position.
'
I It is true, that in the case referred to, this Court decided that in a
question of jurisdiction they might look to the character of the persons composing a corporation; and if it appeared that they were
citizens of another state, and the fact wa set forth by proper averments, the corporation might sue in its corporate name in the Courts
of the United States. But in that case the Court confined its decision, in express terms, to a question ofjurisdiction; to a right to sue;
and evidently went even so far with- some hesitation. We fully
assent to the propriety of that decision; and it has ever since been
recognised as authority in this Court. But the principle has never
been extended any farther than it was carried in that case,; and has
never been supposed to extend to contracts made by a corporation;
especially in another sovereignty, If it were held to embrace contracts, and that the members of a corporation were to be regarded
as individuals carrying on business in their corporate name, and
therefore entitled to the privileges of citizens in matters of contract,
it is very clear that they must at the same time take upon themselyes the liabilities of citizens, and be bound by their contracts in
like manner. The result of this would be to make a corporation a
mere parfnership in business, in which each stockholder would be
liable to the whole, extent of his property for the debts of the corporation; and he might be sued for them, in any state in which he
might happen to be found. The clause of the Constitution referred
to certainly never intended to give to the citizens of each state the
privileges of citizens in the several states, and at the same time to
exempt them from the liabilities which the exercise of such privileges would bring upon individuals who were citizens of the state.
This would be to give the citizens of other states far higher and
greater privileges than are enjoyed by the citizens of the state itself.
Besides, it would deprive every state of all control over the extent

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

587

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

of corporate franchises proper to be granted in the state ; and corporations would be chartered in one, to carry on their operations in
another. It is impossible upon any sound principle to give such a
construction to the article in question. Whenever a corporation
makes a contract, it is the contract of the legal entity; of the artificial being created by the charter; and not the contract of the individual members. The only rights it can claim are the rights which
are given to it in that character, and not the rights which belong to
its members as citizens of a state: and we now proceed to inquire
what rights the plaintiffs in error, a corporation created by Georgia,
could lawfully exercise in another state; and whether the purchase
of the bill of exch.ge on which this suit is brought was a valid
contract, and obligatory on the parties.
The nature and character of a corporation created by a statute,
and the extent of the powers which it may lawfully exercise, have
upon several occasions been under consideration in this Court.
In the case of Head and Amory vs. the Providence Insurance
Company, 2 Cranch, 127, Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the
opinion of the Court, said, "without ascribing to this body, which
in its corporate capacity is the mere creature of the act to which it
owes its existence, all the qualities and disabilities annexed by the
common law to ancient institutions of this sort, it may correctly be
said to be precisely what the incorporating -act has made it; to derive
all its powers from that act, and to be capable of exerting its faculties only in the manner which that act authorizes.
To this source of its being, then, we must re'cur to ascertain its
powers; and to determine whether it can complete a contract by
such communications as are in this record."
In the case of Dartmouth College vs. Woodward;4 Wheat. 636,
the same principle was again decided by the Court. "1A. corporation," said the Court1"is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and
existing only in contemplation of law. Being a mere creature of
the law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its
creation confers upon it, either expressly, or as incidental to its very
existence."
And in the case of the Bank of the United States vs. Dandridge,
12 Wheat. 64, where the questions in relation to the powers of corporations and their mode of action, were very carefully considered;
the Court said,," But whatever may be the implied powers of aggregate corporations by the common law, and the modes by which
those powers are to be carried into operation; corporations created
by statute, must depend both for their powers and the mode of exercising them, upon the true construction of the statute itself."
. It cannot be necessary to add- to these authorities. And it may
be safely assumed that a corporation can make no contracts, and do
no acts either within or without the state which creates it, except
such as are authorized by its charter; and those acts must also be
done, by such officers or agents, and in such manner as the charter
authorizes. And if the law creating a corporation, does" not, by

588

SUPREME. COURT.
(Bank df Augusti s. Earle.]

the true construction of the words used in the charter, give it the
right to exercise its powers beyond the limits of the state, all contracts
made by it in other states would be void
The charter of the Bank of Augusta authorizes it, in general
terms, to deal in bills of exchange ; and, consequently,'gives it the
power to purchase foreign bills as well as inland; in other words,
to purchase bills payable in another state. The power thus given,
clothed the corporation with the right to make contracts out of the
state, in so far as Georgia could confer it. For whenever it purchased a foreignbill, and forwarded it to an agent to present for acceptance, if it was honoured by the drawee, the contract of acceptance was necessarily made in another state; and the general power
to purchase bills without any restriction as to place, by its fair and
natural import, authorized the bank to make such purchases, wherever it was found mostconvenient and profitable to the institution;
and also to employ suitable agents for that purpose. The purchase
of the bill in question was, therefore, the exercise of one of the
powers which the bank pbssessed under its charter; and was sanctioned by. the law of Georgia.creating the corporation, so far as that
state could authorize a corporation to exercise its powers beyond
the limits of its own jurisdiction.
But it has bpen urged in the argument, that notwithstanding the
powers thus conferred by the terms of the charter, a corporation,
from the very nature of its being, can have no authority to contract
out of the limits of the state ; that the laws of a state can have no
extra-territorial operation; and that as a corporation is the mere
creature of a law of the state, it can have no existence beyond the.
limits in which that law operates; and that it must necessarily' be
incapable of making a contract in another place.
It is very true that a corporation can have no legal existence out
of the boundaries of the sovereignty by which it is created. It
exists only in contemplation of law, aid by force of the law; and
where that law ceases to operate, and is no longer obligatory, the
coporation can have no existence. It must dwell in the place of its
creation, and cannot migrate to amiother sovereignty. But although
it must live and have its-being in that state only, yet it does not by
any means follow that its existence there will not be recognised in
other places; and its residence in one state creates no insuperable
obj'ection to its power of contracting in another. It is indeed a mere
artificial being, invisible and intangible ; yet it is a person, for certain purposes in contemplation of law, and has been recognised as
such by the decisions of this Court. It was so held in the case of
The United States vs. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 412, and in Beaston vs.
The Farmer's Bank of Delaware, 12 Peters, 135. Now, natural
persons through the intervention of agents, Ire continually making
contracts in countries in which they do not reside ; and where they
are not personally present when -the contract is made; and nobody
has ever doubted the validity of these agreements. And what
greater 'objection can there be to the capacity of an artificial persorp

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

589

[Lmznk of Augusta v8. Earle.]

by its agents, to make a contract within the scope of its limited
powers, in a sovereignty in which it does not reside ; provided such
contracts are permitted to be made by them by the laws of the
place ?
. The corporation must no doubt show, that the law of its creation
gave it authority to make such contracts, through such agents. Yet,
as in the case of a natural person, it is not necessary that it should
actually exist in the sovereignty in whieh the contract is made. It
is sufficient that its existence as an artificial person, in.the state of
its creation, is acknowledged and recognised by the law of the nation where. the dealing takes place; and that it is permitted by the
laws of that plade to exercise there the powers with which it is endowed.
Every power, however, of the description of which we are seak.
ing, which a corpiration exercises in another state, depends for its
validity upon the laws of the sovereignty iA which it is exetcised;
and a corporation can make no valid contract Without their sanction,
express or implied. And this brings us to the question which has
been so elaborately discussed; whether, by the comity of nati ns
and between these states, the corporations of one state aepermited
to mbke contracts in another. It is needless to enumerate here the
instances in, which, by the, general practice of civilized countries,
the laws of the one, will, by the comity of nations, be recognised and
executed in another, where the right of individuals are concerned.
The cases of contracts made in a foreign country are familiar exampies; and Courts of justice- have always expoundqd arid executed
them, according to the laws of the place in which they were made;
provided that, law was not repugnant to the laws or'policy of their
own country. The comity thus extended to other nationp is no impeachment of sovereignty It is the voluntary act of the flttion by
which it is offered; and is-inadmissible 'when contrary to its policy,
6r prejudicial to its interests; "But it contributes so largely to promote justice between individuals, and to producea friendly intercourse
between the sovereignties to which they belong; that Courts of justice have continually actpd upon it, as a part of the voluntary lawof nations. It is truly said, in Story's Conflict of Laws, 37, that "In
the silence of any positive rule, affirming, or denying, r resiraining
the operation, of foreign laws, Courts of justice pres, 'me the tacit
adoption of them by their own government; unless they are repugnant to its policy, or prejudicial to its.interests. It is not the comity
-of the Courts, but the comity of the nation which is administered, and
ascertained in the same-way, and guided by the same reasoning by
which all otherprinciples of municipal -law are ascertained and
guided."
Adopting, as we do, the principle here stated, we proceed to inquire
whether, by the comity of nations, foreign corporations are permitted o make contracts within their jurisdiction ; and we can per-.
ceive no sufficient reason for excluding them, when they are not
contrary to the known policy of the state, or injurious to its inteVOL. X]II.-3 D

'590

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

rests. It-is nothing more than the admission of the existence of an
artificial person created by the law of another state, and clothed with
the power of making certain contracts. It is but the usual comity
of recognising the law of another state. In England, from which
we have received our general principles ofjurisprudence, no doubt
appears to have been enteptained of the right of a foreign corporation to sue in its Courts; since the case Henriquez vs. The Dutch
West India Company, decided in 1729, 2 L. Raymond, 1532. And it
is a matter of history, which this Court are bound to notice, that corporations, created in this country, have been in the open practice
for many years past, of making contracts in England of various
kinds, and to very large amounts; and we have never seen a doubt
suggested there of the validity of these contracts, by any Court or
any jurist. It is impossible to imagine that any Court in the United
States would refuse to execute a contract, by which an American
corporation had borrowed money in England;-yet if the contracts of
corporations made out of the state by which they were created, are
void, even contracts of that descripti6n could not be enforced.
It has, however, been supposed. that the rules of comity between
foreign nations do not apply to the states- of this 'Union ; that they
extend to one another no other rights than those which are given
by the Constitution of the United States; and that the Courts of
the general government are not at liberty to presume, in the absence
of all legislation on the subject, that a state has adopted the comity
of nations towards the other states, as a part of its jurisprudence ; or
that it acknowledges any rights but those which are secured by tie
Constitution of the United States. The Court think otherwise.
The intimate union of these states, as members of the same great
political family; the deep and vital interests which bind them so
closely together; should lead us, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to presume a greater degree of comity, and friendship, and
kindness towards one another, than we should be authorized to presame between foreign nations. And when (as without doubt must
occasionally happen) the interest or policy'of any state requires it to
restrict the rule, it has but to declare its will, and the legal presumption is at once at an end. But until this is done, upon what grounds
could this Court refuse to administer the law of international comity
between these states? They are sovereign states; and the history
of the past, and the events which are daily occurring, furnish the
strongest evidence that they have adopted towards each other the
laws of comity in their fullest extent. Money is frequently borrowed in one state, by a corporation created in another. The nume.rous banks established by different states are in the constant habit
of contracting' and dealing with one another. Agencies for corporations engaged in the business of insurance and of banking have
been established in other states, and suffered to make contracts without any objection on.the part of the state aultorities. These usages
of commerce and trade have been so general and public, and have
been practised for so long a period of time, and-so generally acqui-

esced in by the states, that the Court cannot overlook them when a
question like the one before us is under consideration. The silence
of the state authorities, while these events are passing before them,
show their assent to the ordinary laws of comity which permit a
corporation to make contracts in another state. But we are not left
to infer it merely .from the general usages of trade, and the silent
acquiesence of the states. It appears from the cases cited in the
argument, which it is unnecessary to recapitulate in this opinion;
,that it has been decided in many of the state Courts, we believe in
all of them where the ques.tion has arisen, that a. corporation of one
state mdy sue in thc Courts of another. If it may sue, why may it
not make a contract? The right to sue is one of the powers which
it derives from its charter. - If'
the Courts of another country take
notice of its existence as a corporation, so far as to allow it to maintain a suit, and permit it to exercise that power; why should not its
existence be recognised for other purposes, and the corporation permitted to exercise another power which is given to it by the same
law and the same sovereignty-where .the last mentioned power
does not come in conflict with the interest or policy of the state ?
There is certainly nothing in the nature and character of a corpora-.
tion which could justly lead to such a distinction; and which should
extend to it the comity of suit, and refuse to it the comity of contract.
If it is allowed to sue, it would of course be permitted to compromise, if it thought proper, with its debtor ;"to give him time; to accept
something else in satisfaction; to give him a release; and to employ
an attorney for itself to conduct its suit. These are all matters of
contract, and yet are so intimately connected with the right to sue,
that the latter could not be effectually exercised if the former were
denied.
We turn in the next place to the legislation of the states.
So far as any of them have acted on this subject, it is evident that
they have regarded the comity of contract, as well as the comity
of suit, to be a part of the law of the state, unless restrictdd by
statute. Thus a law was passed by the state of Pennsylvania,
March 10, 1810, which prohibited foreigners and foreign corporations from making contracts of insurance against fire, and other
losses mentioned in the law. In New York, also, a law was passed,
March 18, 1814, which prohibited -foreigners and foreign corporations from making in that state insurances against fire;' and by
another law, passed April 21, 1818, corporations chartered by other
states are prohibited from keping any Office of deposit for the purpose of discounting promissory notes, or carrying ofi any kind of
business which incorporated banks are authorized by law to carry
on. The prohibition of certain specified contracts by corporations
in these laws, is by necessary implication an admission that other
contracts may be made by foreign corporations in Pennsylvania, and
New .Ydrk; and that no legislative permission is necessary to give
them validity. And the language of these'prohibitory acts most

SUPREME COURT
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

clearly indicates that the contracts forbidden by them might lawfully
,have been made before these laws were passed.
Maryland has gone still farther in recogn.sing this right. By a
law passed in 1834, that state has prescribed the manner in which
corporations not chartered by the state, "which shall transact or
shall have transacted business" in the state, may be sued in its,
Courts upon contracts made in the state. The law assumes in the
clearest manner, that' such contracts were valid, and .provides a
remedy by which to enforce them.
In the legislation of Congress, also, where the states and the,
people of the several states are all represented, we shall find proof
of the general understanding in the United States, that by the law
of comity among the states, the corpoiations chartered by one were
permitted to make contracts in the others. By the act, of Congress
of June o3, 1836, (4 Story's Laws, 2445,) regulating the deposites
of public money, the Secretary of the Tteasury was authorized to
make arrangements with some bank or banks, to establish' an agency
in the stateg and 'territories where there was no bank, or none that
could be employed as a public depository, to receive and disburse
the public money which might be directed to b there deposited.
Now if the proposition be tXue that a corporation created by one
state cannot make a valid contract in another, the contracts made
through 'this agency in behalf of the bank, out of the state where
the bank itself was chartered, would all be void, b6th as respected
the contracts with the government and the individuals who dealt
with it. How could such an agency, upon the principles now contended for, have performed any of the duties for which it was established?
But it carinot be necessary to pursue the argument further. We
think it is well settled, that by the law of comity among nations, a
corporation created by one sovereignty is permitted to make contracts in another, and to sue in ts Courts; and that the same law
of _comity prevails among the several sovereignties of this Union.
The' public and well known, and long continued usages of trade;
the general acquiescence of the states; the particular legislation of
some oi them, as-well as the legislation of Congress ; 'all concur in
proving, the truth of this proposition.
But we have already said that this comity is presumed from the
silent acquiescence of the state. Whenever a state sufficiently indicates that contracts which derive their validity from its comity aro,
repugnant to its policy, or are considered as injurious to its interests;
the presumption in favour of its adoption can no longer, be made.
Ana it remains to inquire, whether there is any thing in the constitution or laws of Alabama, from which. this -Court would be justified in concluding that the purchase of the bill in question was contrary to its policy.
'The constitution of.Ala ama contains the following provisions in
relation to banks
"One state bank may be established, with such number of

JANUARY TERM, 1839,

593

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.)

branches as the General Assembly may from time to time deem
expedient, provided that no branch bank shall be established, no'f
bank charter renewed, under the authority of this state, without the
concurrence of two-thirds of both houses of the General Assembly;
and provided also that not more than one bank or branch bank shall
be established, nor bank charter renewed, but 'in conformity to the
following rules:
" 1. At least two-fifths of the capital stock shall be reserved for
the state.
"2. A proportion of power, in the direction of the bank, shall be
reserved to the state, equal at least to its proportion of stock therein.
"3. The state and individual stockholders shall be liable respectively for the debts of the bank, in proportion to their stock h6lden
therein.
"4. The remedy for collecting debts shall be reciprocal, for and
against the bank.
" 5. No bank shall commence operations until half of the capital
stock subscribed for be actually paid in gold and silver; which
amount shall, in no case, be less than one hundred thousand
dollars."
Now from these provisions in the constitution, it is evidently the
policy of Alabama to restrict the power of the legislature in relation
to bank charters, and to secure to the state a large portion of the
profits of banking, in order to provide a public revenue; and also to
make safe the debts which should be contacted by the banks. The
meaning too ii.which that state used the word bank, in her constitution, is sufficiently plain from its subsequent legislation. All of the
banks chartered by it, are authorized to receive deposits of-money,
to discount notes, to purchase bills of exchange, and to issue their
own notes payable on demand to bearer. These are the usual
powers conferred on the banking corporations in the diffetent states
of the Union; and when We are dealing with the business of banking
in Alabama, we must undoubtedly attach to it the meaning in which
it is used in the constitution and laws of the state. Upon so much
of the policy ofAlabama, therefore, in relation to banks as is disclosed by its constitution, and upon the meaning which that state
attaches to the word bank, we can have no reasonable doubt. But
before this Court can undertake to say that the discount of the bill
in question was illegal, many other inquiries must be made, and
many other difficulties must be solved. Was it the policy of Alabama to exclude all competition with its own banks by the corpora4
tions of other states? Did the state intend, by these provisions, in
its constitution, and these charters to its banks, to inhibit the circulation of the notes of other banks, the discount'of notes, the loan of
money, and the purchase of bills of exchange? Or did it design to
go still further, and forbid the banking corporations of other states
from making a contract of any kind within its territory? Did it
mean to prohibit its own banks from-keeping mutual accounts with
the banks of other states, and from entering into any contract with
3D2

75

SUPREME' COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs:.-Eare.]

them, express or implied? Or did. she mean to give to 'fer banks
the power of contracting within the limits of the state with foreign
corporations, and deny it to individual citizens ? She may believe it
to be the interest of her citizens to permit the competition of other
banks in the circulation of notes. in the purchase fnd aalq of bills
of exchange, and in the loan'of money. Or she may think it to be
her interest to prevent te circlilation of the notes of other banks;
and to prohibit them from. sending money there to b employed in
the purchase of exchange, or making contraets of any other description.
The state has not made known its policy upon Any of these points.
And how can this Court, with no other lights before, it, undertake
to mark gut by a definite and distinct line the policy which .'labama
has adqpted in relation to this complex and inticate question, of
political economy? It. is true that the state is the pvincipal stockholder in her own banks. She has created seven; and- in five of
them the state owns the. whole stock; and in the othprs two-fifths.
This proves that the state is deeply interested in the si ceessful
operation of her banks, and it may be her policy to sh it out all interference with them. In anot-her view of the subject, however, she
may believe it to be her policy to extend the utmost liberality to the
banks of other states; in the expectation that it would produce a
corresponding comity in other states towards the banks in which she
is so much interested. In. this respe6t it is a question chiefly of
revenue, and of fiscal policy. How can this Court, with no other
aid than the general principles asserted in her constitution, and her
investments in the stocks of her own banks, unddrtak6 to carry out
the policy of the state upon' such a subject in all of ts details, and
decide how far it extend, and what qualifications and limitations
are imposed upon it? These questions must be determined by the
state itself, and not by the Courts of the'.United S ates. Every
soveleignty would withoht doubt choose to designate its own line
of policy ; and would never consent to leaive it as a problem to be
worked out by the Courts of.the United States, from a few general
principles, which might very naturally be iffiisunderstood or misapplied by the Court. It would hardly be respectful to a state for this
Court to forestall its decision, and to say, in advance of her legislation, what her interest or policy demands. Such a course would
savour moIre of legislation than of judicial interpretation.
If we proceed from the constitution and bank charters to other
acts of legislation by the state, we find nothing that should lead us
to a contrary conclusion. By an act of Assembly of the state, passed
January 12th, 1827, it was declared unlawful for any person, body
corporate, company, or association, to issue an'iiote for circulation
as a bank note, without -the authority of law ;".and a fine was imposed upon any one offending against this statute. .Now this act
protected the privileges of her own banks; in relation to bank notes
only; and contains no prohibitizrn against the purchasb of bills of
exchange, or against any other business 'by foreign banks, which

JANUARY' TERM, 1839.

595

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

might interfere with her own banking corporations. And if we
were to form our opinion, of the policy of Miabama from the pro.
visions of this law, we should be bound to say that the logislature
deemed it to be the interest and policy of the state not to p-)tect its
own banks froxg competition zin the purchase of exchange, or in any
thing but the issuing of notes for circtlation. Bt this law was repealed by a subsequent law, passed it 183H, repealing all nets of
Assembly not comprised in. a digest then prepared and adopted -by
the legislature. The lawof 1827 above mentioned was not contained in this digest, and was consequently repealed. It has been
said at the bar, in the argument, that it was omitted from the digest
by mistake, arid was not intended to be repealed. But this Court
cannot act judicially upon such an assumption. We must take their
laws- and pojicy ta be such as we find them ra their statutes. And the
only inference that we ian draw from these two laws, is, that after
having prohibited under a penalty any competition with theii banks
by the issue of notes for circulation, they changed their policy, and
determined to leave the whole -business of banking open to the
rivalry of others. The other laws of the state, therefore, in addition
to the constitution and charters, certainly would not authorize this
Court to say, that the purchase of bills by tie corporations of another
state was a violation of its policy.
The decisions )f its judicial tribunals lead tp the same result. It
is true that L. the case of The State vs. Stebbins, 1 Stewart's Alabama-Reports, 312, the Court said that since the adoption of their
constitutico., banking in that state was to be regarded as a franchise.
And this case has been much relied on by the defendant in error.
Now we are satisfied, from a careful examination of the case, that
the word franchise was not used- and co.uild not have been. used by
the Court in the broad sense imputed to it in the argument. For if
banking incljdes the purchase of bills of exchange, and all banking
is to be regarded as the 'xercise of a franchise, the decision of the
Court would amount to this-that no individual citizen of Alabama
could purchase such a bill. For franchises are special privileges
conferred by government upon individuals, and which do not belong
to the citizens of the country, generally, of common right. It is essential to the character of a franchise that it should be a grant from the
sovereign authority, and in this country no franchise can be' held
which is not derived from a law of the state.
But -it cannot be supposed that the constitution of Alabama intended to prohibit its merchants and traders from purchasing or
selling bills of exchange; and to make it a monopoly in the hands
of their bank§. And it is evident that the Court of Alabama, in the
case of The State vs. Stebbins, did not mean to assert such a principle. In the passage relied on' they are speaking of a paper circulating currency, and asserting the right of the state to regulate and
to limit it.
The institutions of Alabama, like those of the othef states, are
founded upon the great principles of the common law; and it is

596

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

very clear that at common law, the right of banking in all of its
ramifications, belonged to individual citizens; and might be exercised
by them at their pleasure. And the correctness of thi& principle is
not questioned in the case of The State vs. Stebbins. Undoubtedly,
the sovereign authority may regulate and restrain this right: but
the constitution of Alabama purports to be nothing more than a
restriction upon the power of the legislature, in relation to banking
corporations; and does not appear to have been intended as a
restriction upon the rights of individuals. -That part of the subject
appears to have been left, as is usually done, for the action of the
legislature, to be modified according to circumstances; and the prosecution against Stebbins was not founded on the provisions contained in the constitution, but was under the law of 1827 above
mentioned, prohibiting the issuing of bank notes. We are fully satisfied that the state never intended by its constitution to interfere with
the right of purchasing or selling bills of exchange ; and that the
opinion of the Court does not refer to transactions of that description,
when it speaks of banking as a franchise.
The question then recurs-,-Does the policy of Alabama deny to
the corporations of other states the ordinary comity between nations?
or does it permit such a corporation to make those contracts which
from their nature and subject matter, are consistent with its policy,
and are allowed to individuals ? In making such contracts a corpgratioflno doubt exercises its corporate franchise. But it must do
this whenever it acts as a corporation, for its existence is a franchise.
Now it has been held in the Court of Alabama itself, in 2 Stewart's
Alabama Reports, 147, that the corporation of another state may
sue in its Courts; and the decision is put directly on the ground of
national comity. The state therefore has not merely acquiesced by
silence, but her judicial tribunals have declared the adoption of the
law of international comity in the case of a shit. We have already
shown that the comity of suit brings with it the comity of contract;
and where the one is expressly adopted by its Courts, the other must
also be presumed according to the usages of nations, unless the contrary can be shown.
The cases cited from 7 Wend. 276, and from 2 Rand. 465, cannot
influence the decision in the case before us. The decisions of these
two state Courts were founded upon the legislation of their respective
states, which was sufficiently explicit to enable their judicial tribunals to pronounce judgment on their line Df, policy. But because
two states have adopted a particular policy in relation to the banking
corporations of other states, we cannot infer that the same rule prevails in all of the other states.
Each state must decide for itself. And it will be remembered,
that it is rjot the state of Alabama which appears here to complain
of an infraction of its policy. Neither the state, nor any.of its constituted authorities, have interfered in this controversy. The objection is taken by persons who were parties to those contracts; and

'JANUARY TERM, 1839.

597

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

who participated in the transactions which are now alleged to have
been in violation of the laws of the state.
It is but justice to all the parties concerned to suppose that these
contracts were made in good faith, and that no suspicion was entertained by either of them that these engagements could not be enforced. Money was paid on them by one party, and received by
the other.. And when we see men dealing with one another openly
in this manner, and making contracts to a large amount,,we can
hardly doubt as to what was the generally received opinion in Alabama at that time, in relation to the right of the plaintiffs to make
such contracts. Every thing now urged as proof of her policy, tas
equally public and well known when these bills were negotiated.
And when a Court is called on to declare contracts thus made to be
void upon the ground that they conflict with the policy of the state;
the line of that policy should be very clear and distinct to justify the
Court in sustaining the defence. Nnthj ig can be more vague and
indefinite than that now insisted on as the policy of Alabama. It
rests altogether on speculative reasoning as to her suiposed interests;
and is not supported by any positive legislation. There is no law
of the state which attempts to define the rights of foreign corporations.
We, however, do not mean to say that there are riot many'subjects upon which the policy of the several states is abundantly
evident, from the nature of their institqtions, and the general scope
of their legislation; and which do not needthe aid of a positive and
special law to guide the decisions of the Courts. When'the policy
of a state is thus manifest, the Courts of the United States would be'
bound to notice it as a part of its code of laws; -and to declare all
contracts in the state repugnant to it, to be illegal and void. -Nor do
we mean to say whether there may not be some rights uhder the
Constitution of the United States, which a corporation might claim
under peculiar circumstances, in a state other than that in which it
was chartered. The reasoning, as well as- the judgment of tho
Court, is applied to the matter before us; and we thinli the c tracts in question. were valid, and that the defence relied on bV . h&
defendants cannot be sustained.
The judgment of the Circuit 'Court in these cases, must therefbre
be reversed with costs.
Mr. Justice BA'DWIN delivered an opinion assenting to the judgment of the Court, on principles which were stated at large in' the
opinion. This opinion was not delivered to the reporter.
Mr.- Justice M'KINLEY delivered an opinion, dissenting from the
judgment of the Court.
I dissent from so much of the opinion of the majority of the Court
as decides that the law of nations furnishes a rule by which validity
can be given to the contracts in these cases; and from 'so much as

598

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

decides that the contracts, which were the subjects of the suits, were
not against the policy of the laws of Alabama.
This is the first time since the adoption of the Constitution of the
United States, that any federal Court has, directly or indirectly, imputed national power to any of the states of the Union; and it is
the first time that validity has been given to such contracts, which,
it is acknowledged, would otherwise have been void, by the application of a principle of the necessary law of nations. This principle
has been adopted and administered by the Court as part of the municipal law of the state of Alabama, although no such principle has
been adopted or admitted by that state. And whether the law of
nations still prevails among the states, notwithstanding the Constitition of the United States; or the right and authority to administer it
in these cases are derived from that instrument; are questions not
distinctly decidcdt by the majority of the Court. But whether attempted to be derived from one source or the other, I deny the
existence of it anywhere, for any such purpose.
Because the municipal laws of nations cannot operate beyond
their respective territorial limits, and because one natio i has no
right to legislate for another; certain rules founded in the law of
nature and the immutable principles of justice have, for the promotion of harmony and commercial ifttercourse, been adopted by the
consent of civilized nations. But no necessity exists for such a law
among the several states. In their character of states they are
governed by written constitutions and municipal laws. It has been
admitted by the counsel, and decided by the majority of the Court,
that without the authority of the statutes of the states chartering
these banks, they would have no power whatever to purchase a bill
of exchange, even in the state where they are established. If it
requires the exertion of the legislative power of Pennsylvania, for
instance, to enable the United States Bank to purchase a bill of exchange in that state ; why" should it not require the same legislative
authority to enable it to do the same act in Alabama? It has been
contended in argument, that the power granted to the bank to purchase a bill of exchange at Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania, payable
at Mobile, in Alabama, would be nugatory, unless the power existed
also to make contracts at both ends of the line of exchange. The
authority to deal in exchange may very well be exercised by having
command of one end of the line of exchange only. To buy and sell
the same bill at the bank is dealing in exchange, and may be exercised with profit to the bank; but not perhaps as conveniently as if
it could make contracts in Alabama as well as at the bank. '
But if it has obtained authority to command but one end of the
line of exchange, it certainly has no right to complain that it cannot
control the other; when that other is within the jurisdiction of another state, whose authority or consent it has -not even asked for.
The bill of exchange which is the subject of controversy between
the Bank of Augusta and Earle, and that which is the subject
of controversy between the United States Bank and Primrose.

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

599

[Bank of Augusta vs. Eayle.]

were both drawn at Mobile, and made payable at New York.
Neither of the banks had authority from any state, to make a contract at either end of the line of exchange here, established. Here,
then, they claim, and have exercised, all the rights and privileges
of natural persons, independent of their charters; and claim the
right, by the comity of nations, to make original contracts everywhere, because they have a right, by their charters, to make like
contracts in the states where they were created, and have "a local
habitation and a name."
It is difficult to conceive of the exercise of national comity, by a
state having no national power. Whatever national power the old
thirteen states possessed previous to the adoption of the Constitution
of the United States, they conferred, by that instrument, upoi the
federal government. And to remove all doubt upon the question,
whether the power thus conferred was exclusive or concurrent, the
states are, by the tenth section of the first article of the Constitution,
expressly prohibited from entering into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; and, without the consent of Congress, from entering
into any agreement or compact with'another state, or with a foreign
power. B1- these provisions, the states have, by their own voluntary act, and for wise purposes, deprived themselves of all national
power, and of all the means of international communication ; and
cannot even enter into an agreement or compact with a sister state,
for any purpose whatever, without the consent of Congress. The
comity of nations is defined by Judge Story, in his Conflict of Laws,
to be the obligations of the laws of one. nation in the territories of
another, derived, altogether from tie voluntary consent of the latter.
And in the absence of any positive rule, affirming, or denying, or
restraining the operation of foreign laws, Courts of justice.presume
the tacit adoption of them by their own government, unless they
are repugnant to its policy or prejudicial to its nterests. Conflict of
Laws, 37.
Now, I ask again, what is the necessity for such a rule of law as
this? Have not the states full power to adopt or reject what laws
of their sister states they please ? And why should the Courts interfere in this casb, when the states have full power to legislate for
themselves, and to adopt or reject such laws of their sister states as
they think proper? If Alabama had adopted these laws, no difficulty could have arisen in deciding between these parties. This
Court would not then have been under the necessity of resorting to
a doubtful presumption for a rule to guide-its decision. But when
the Court have determined that they have the power to presume
that Alabama has adopted the laws of the states charterihg these
banks, other difficult questions arise. How much of the charter of
.each bank has been adopted ? This is a question of legislative discretion, which, if submitted to the legislature of the state, would be
decided upon reasons of.policy, and public convenience. And the
question of power, to pass such a law under the Constitution of
Alabama, would have to be considered and decided. These are

600

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

very inconvenient questions for a judicial tribunal to determine. As
the majority of the Court have not expressly stated whether Ala'bama has adopted the whole-charters of the banks, or what parts
they have adopted, there is now no certainty what the law of Alabama is on the subject of these charters.
But these are not all the difficulties that arise in the exercise of
this power by the judiciary. Many questions very naturally present themselves in the investigation of this.subject, and the first is,
To what governrfent does this power belong? Secondly, Has it been
conferred upon the United States ? or has it been reserved to the states'
by the tenth amendment of the Constitution ? If it be determined that
the power belongg to the United States, in what provision of the
Constitution is it to be found ? And how is it to be exercised ? By
the judiciary, or by Congress? The counsel for the banks contended,
that the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the several states, deprives Alabama of the power to pass any law restraining the sale and purchase of a bill of exchange; and, by consequence,
the whole power belongs to Congress. The Court, by the opinion
of the majority, does not recognise this doctrine, in terms. But if
the power which the Court exercised, is not derived from that provi.sion of the' Constitution, in my opinion it does not exist.
.If ever Congress shall exercise this power to the broad extent
contended for, the power of the states over commerce, and contracts
relating to commerce,will be reduced to very narrow limits. The
creation of banks, the making and endorsing of bills of exchange
and promissory notes,'and the damages on bills of exchange, all relate, more or less, to the commerce among the several states. Whether the exercise of these powers amounts to regulating the commerce among the several states, is not a question for niy determination on this occasion. The majority of the Court have decided that
the comity of rfations gives validity to these contracts.
And what are the reasons upon which this doctrine is now establishod? Why, the counsel for the banks say: We are -obliged to
concede that these banks had no authority to make these contracts in
the state of Alabama, in virtue of the laws of the states creating
them, or by the laws of Alabama. Therefore, unless this Court will
extend to them the benefit of the comity of nations, they must lose
all the money now in controversy,-they will be deprived hereafter
of the benefit of a very profitable branch of their business as bankers,. and great public inconvenience will result to the commerce of
the country. And besides all this, there are many corporations in
the north, which were created for the purpose of carrying on various
branches of manufactures, and particularly that of cotton Those
engaged in the manufacture of cotton will be unable to send their
agents to the south to sell their ianufactured articles, and to purchase
cotton to carry on their business: and may lose debts already created.. This is the whole amount of the argument, upon which the
benefit of this doctrine is claimed. Because banks carnot make
money in places and by means not authorized by their 'charters;

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

601

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

because they may lose by contracts made in unauthorized places;
because the commerce of the coinitry may be subjected to temporary inconvenience; and because corporations in the north, created
for manufacturing purposes only, cannot, by the authority of their
charters, engage in commerce also; this doctrine, which has not
heretofore found a place in our civil code, is to be established. Notwithstanding, it is conceded that the states hold ample legislative
power over the same subject, it is deemed necessary, on this occasion, to settle this doctrine by the supreme tribunal The majority
of the Court having, in their opinion, coneceded that Alabama might
make lawkrs to prohibit foreign banks to make contracts, thereby admitted, by implication, that she- could make laws to perm it such contracts. I think it would have been proper to have left the power
there, to be exercised or-not, as Alabama, in her sovereign discretion,
might judge best for her interest or her comity. The majority of
the Court thought and decided otherwise. And here arises the radical and essential difference between them and me.
They maintain a power in the federal government, and in the
judicial department of it, to do that which in my judgment belongs,
exclusively, to the state governments; and to be exercised by the
legislative and not the judicial departments thereof. A difference
so radical and important, growing out of the fundamental law of
the land, has imposed on me the unpleasant necessity of maintaining, single handed, my opinion, against the opinion of all the other
members of the Court. However unequal. the conflict, duty impels
me to maintain it firmly; and, although I stand, alone here,.I have
the good fortune to be sustained, to the whole extent of my opinion,,
by the very able opinion of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, in
the ease of the Marietta Bank vs. Peridell and others, 2 Ran. Rep.
465. If Congress have the power to pass laws on. this subject, it is
an exclusive power; and the states would then have ne power to
prohibit contracts of any kind within'their jurisdictions. If the gpvernment .f the United States 'have power to restrain the states,
under the power to regulate commerce, whether it be exerted by
the legislative or the judicial department of the government is not
material; it being the paramount law, it paralyses all state power
on the same subject. And this brings me to the Consideration of the
second ground on which I dissent.
It was. contended by the counsel for the banks, that all the restraints imposed by the constitution of Alabama, in relation to banking, were designed to operate upon the legislature of, the state, and
not upon the citizens of that or any other state. To comprehend
the whole scope and intention of that instrument, it will be necessary to ascertain from the language used, what was within the contemplation and design of the convention. The provision in the
constitution on the subject of banking is this: ".One state bank may:be established, with such number of bran6hes as the General Assembly may, from time to time, deem expedient; provided, th4 to
branch bank shall .be established, nor bank charter reilewed, under
VOL. XIII.-3 E

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

the authority of this state, without the concurrence of two-thirds of
both houses of the General Assembly; and provided, also, that not
more than one bank nor branch bank~shall be established, nor bank
charter renewed, at any one session of the General Assembly, nor
shall any bank or branch- bank be established, or bank charter renewed, but in conformity with the following rules:
1. At least two-fiths of the capital stock shall be reserved for the
state.
2. A proportion of power in the direction of the bank shall be
reserved to the state, equal at least to its proportion of stock therein.
3. The' state, and tbe individual stockholders, shall be liable, respectively, for the debts of the bank, in proportion to their stock
holden therein.
4. The remedy for collecting debts -shall be reciprocal for and
against the bank.
5. No bank shall commence operations until half of the capital
stock subscribed for shall be actually paid in gold or silver, which
amount shall in no case be less than one hundred thousand dollars."
There are a few other unimportant rules laid down, but they are
not material tO the present inquiry. The inquiry naturally suggests
itself to the mind, Why did Alabama introduce into her constitution
these very unusual and specific rules? If they had not been deemed
of great importance, they would not have been found there. Can
any one say, therefore, that tl~is regularly organized system, to which
all'banks within the state of Alabama were to conform, did not establish for the state, her legislature, or other authorities a clear and
unequivocal policy on the subject of banking? It has been conceded in the argument, and by the opinion of the majority of the
Court, that these constitutional provisions do restrict and limit the
power of the legislature of the state. Then the legislature cannot
establish a bank in Alabama, but in conformity with the rules -here
laid down. They have established seen 'banks; five of them belonging exclusively to the state, and two-fifths of the stock of the
other two, with a proportionate power in the direction, reserved to
the state. Each of these banks is authorized to deal in exchange.
It is proper to stop here, and inquire whether the subject of exchange is proper to enter into the policy of the legislation of a
state; and whether it is a part of the customary and legitimate
business of" banking. All the authorities on the subject show that
in modern times it is a part of the business of banking. See Postlethwaite's Commercial Dictionary, title Bank; Tomlin's Law Dictionary, title Bank; Rees' Cyclopudia, title Bank.; Vatt. 105. This last
author quoted, after showing that it is the duty of the sovereign of
a nation to furnish for his subjects a sufficiency of money for the
purposes of commerce, to presorve it from adulteration, and to punish
those who counterfeit it, proceeds to say, " There is another custom more modern, and of no less use to commerce, than the establishment of money, namely, exchange, or the business of the
bankers; by means of whom a merchant remits immense sums from

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

one end of the world to the other with very little expense, and, if he
pleases, without danger. For the same reasons that, sovereigns
are obliged to protect commerce, they are obliged to protect this
custom by good laws, in which every merchant foreigner, or citizen
may find security." From these authorities it appears that exchange
is a part of modern banking, or at least so intimately connected with
it that all modern banks have authority to deal in it.. And it also
appears that it is as much the duty of a state to provide for exchange,
as for money or, a circulating medium, for its subjects or citizens.
When the state of Alabama reserved to herself, by her fundamental law, at least two-fifths of the capital and control of all banks
to be created in the state, and, by her laws, has actually appropriated
to herself the whole of the capital, management, and profits of five
out of seven banks, and two-fifths of the other two; had she not the
same right to appropriate the banking right, to deal in exchange, to
herself, to the same extent? While performing her duty, under- the
constitution, by providing a circulating medium for the citizens, she
was not unmindful of her'duty in relation to exchange, and that is
.also provided for. Has she not provided increased security and
safety to the merchant by making herself, liable for the payment of
every bill of exchange sold by the five banks belonging to her, and
for two-fifths of all sold by the other two ? 'And has she not also
provided by law, that all the profits derived from thus dealing in
bills of exchange shall go into the public treasury, for the common
benefit of the people of the state ? And has she not, by. the profits
arising from her banking, including the profits on'exchange, been
enabled to pay the whole expenses of the government, and thereby
to abolish all direct or other taxation ? See Aikin's Digest, 651.
It was not the intention of the legislature, by conferring the power
upon these banks to purchase and sell bills of' exchange, to deprive
the citizens of the state, or any other natural person, of the right to
do the same thing. But it was the intention to exclude all accu-_
mulated bank capital which did not belong to the state, in whole
or in part, according to the constitution, from dealing in exchange ;
and such is the inevitable and legal effect of those laws. Let us test
this principle. It is admitted by the majority of the Court, in their
opinion, that these constitutional provisions were intended as a
restraint upon the legislature of the state. If so intended, the legislature can pass no law contrary to the spirit and intention of the
constitution ; or contrary to the spirit and intention of the charters
of the banks, created in pursuance of its provisions. Now were the
laws chartering the banks which are parties to this suit, contrary to
the spirit and intention of the constitution and laws of Alabama ?
That is the precise question.
it must be borne in mind that these were banks, and nothing but
banks that made the contracts in Alabama; and in that character,
and that only, have they been considered in the opinion of the
majority of the Court. Were those banks chartered by the legislature of Alabama, two-thirds of both houses concurring ? Was, at
least, two-fifths of the capital stock, and of the management of these

604

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

banks reserved to the state ? Did the profits arising from the-purchase of these bills of eichange go into the treasury of Alabama?
All these questions must be answered in the negative. Then these
are not constitutional banks in Alabama, and cannot contract there?
The majority of the Court havedecided these causes upon the presumption that Alabama had adopted the laws of Georgia, Louisiana,
and Pennsylvania chartering these banks. And this presumption
rests for its support upon the fact that there is nothing in the laws
or the policy of the laws of Alabama to resist this presumption. I
suppose it will not be contended that the power of this Court, to
-presume that Alabama had adopted these laws, is greater than the
power of Alabama to adopt the laws for herself. Suppose these
banks had made a direct application to the legislature of Alabama
to pass a law to authorize them to deal in bills of exchange in that
state, could the legislature have passed such a law without violating
the constitution of the state ?
An incorporated bank in Alabama is not only the mere creature
of the law creating it, as banks are in other states; but it is the
creature of a peculiar fundamental law; and if its charter is not in
conformity to the provisions of the fundamental law, it is void. It
must be recollected that the banks, which 4re the plaintiffs in these
suits, when they present themselves to the legislature, asking permission to use their corporate privileges there, are not demanding a right, but asking a favour, which the _legislature may grant
or 'refuse as it pleases. If it should refuse, it would violate no
duty, incur no responsibility. If, however, the Court exercise the
power, it is upon the positive obligation of Alabama, that the presumption must arise, or the right does not exist. A positive rule of
law cannro arise out of an imperfect obligation, by presumption or
implication. But to put it on the foot of bare repugnance of the
law, presumed to be adopted, to the laws of the country adopting,
if there be any repugnance the Court ought not to presume the
adoption. 'Story's Conflict of Laws, 37. The charter of every bank
not created in conformity with the constitution of Alabama, must, at
least, be repugnant to it. The presumption is, that the charters of
all these banks were repugiant, there being no reason or inducement to make them conform inthe states where they were created.
The powcer of the Court to adopt the laws creating these banks, as
they actually existect, and the power of the legislature of Alabama to
adopt them in a modified form, or to'grant the banks a mere permission to do a specified act, present very different questions, and involve
very diffeent powers. If, therefore, the l -,slature could not adoptthe, charters in the least objectionable form, nor authorize the banks
to deal in exchange, without violating the constitution of Alabama,
how can it be said that the contracts in controversy are not against
the policy of the laws -ofAlabama? And by what authority does
the majority of this Coui't presume that Alabama has adopted those
laws? The general rule is, that slight evidence and circumstances
shall defeat a mere legal presumption of law. This case will be a
signal exception to that rule.

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

[Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.)

In the case of Pennington vs. Townsend, 7 Wend. Rep. 278, the
Protection and Lombard Bank, chartered by New Jersey, by agents,
undertook to do banking business in New York, and there discounted
the check which was the subject of the suit, inviolation of the
restraining acts of 1813 and 1818; the first of which enacts that no
person unauthorized by law shall become a member of any association for the purpose of issuing notes or transacting any other
business which incorporated banks may or do transact. The act of
1818 enacts that it shall not be lawful for any person, association,
or body corporate to keep any office of deposit for discounting, or
for carrying on any kind of banking business, and affixes a penalty
of $1000, to be recovered, &c. Under these laws the contract between the parties was held to be void; and the Court says, "The
protection against the evil intended to be remedied, to wit, preventing banking wiih6ut the authority of the legislature of the state, is
universal in its application within the state, and without exception ;.
unless qualffied by the same power which enacted it, or by some
other paramount law. Such is not the law incorporating this bank."
Is there any thing in these laws which more positively prohibits
banking in New York, without the authority of the legislature of
that state, than there is in the constitution of Alabama, prohibiting
all banking except in the manner prescribed by the constitution ?
Can it be believed that she intended to protect herself against the
encroachments of her own legislature only, and to leave herself exposed to the encroachments of all her sister states ? Does the language employed in these provisions of the constitution justify any
such construction?' It is general, comprehensive, and not only
restrictive, but expressly prohibitory. Whatever is forbidden by the.
constitution of Alabama, can be done by no one within her jurisdiction ; and it was sufficient for her to know that no bank could do
any valid banking act there without violating. her constitution. It
was contended, by the counsel for the banks, that no law could be
regarded as declaring the policy of the state, unless it was penal, and
inflicted some punishment for its violation. This doctrine is as
novel as it is unfounded in principle. I know of no such, exclusive
rule by which to reach the mind and intention of the legislature.
If the language used shows clearly that particular acts were intended
to be prohibited, and the act is afterwards done, it is against the
policy of the law and void. Suplose the legislature of Alabama
were to establish'a bank, disregarding all the conditions and restrictions imposed by the constitution : would it not violate that instrument, and therefore the act be void? And can Georgia, Louisiana, or
PennsylVania, by their respective legislatures, do in Alabama what
her own legislature cannot do? The relation's which these states
hold towards each other, in their individual capacity of states, under
the Constitution of the United States, is that of perfect independence.
In the case of Buckner vs. Finley and Van Lear, 2 Peters' Rep. 590,
Chief Justice Marshall said, "For all national purposes embraced hy
the federal Constitution, the states and the citizens f ereof are o'fie
3@ 2

SUPREME COURT.
(Bank of Augusta vs. Earle.]

united under the same sovereign authority, and governed by the
same laws. In all other respects the states are -necessarily foreign
to, and independent of each other." It is in this foreign and independent relation that these four states stand before this Court in
hese cases. The conditionof Alabama, taken with a view to this
relation, cannot be worse than that of an independent nation, in like
circumstances. What that would be we will see from authority.
" Nations being free and independent of each other inthe sane
manner as men are naturally free and independent, the second
general law of their society is that each flation ought to be left in
the peaceable enjoyment of that liberty it has derived from nature.
The natural society of nations cann'ot subsist, if the rights which
,each has received from nature are not respected. None would
willingly renounce its liberty: it would rather break off all commerce with those that should attempt to violate it. From this
liberty and independence it follows that every nation is to judge of
what its conscience demands, of what it can orcannot do, of what
is proper or improper to be done; and consequently to examine
and determine whether it can perform any office for another without
being wanting in what it owes to itself. In all cases, then, where a
nation has the liberty of judging what its duty requires, another
aannot oblige it to act in such or such a manner. For the attempting this would be doing an injury to the liberty of nations. A right
o offer constraint. to a free person can only be invested in us in
such caseswhere that person is bound to Iperform some particular
thing for us, or from a particular reason that does not depend 'on his
judgment; or, in a word, where we have a complete authority over
him." Vatt. 53, 54.
Now apply these just and reasonable principles to Alabama, in
her relation of a foreign and independent state, reposing upon the
rights reserved to her by the tenth amendment of the Constitution
of the United States; and then show the power that can compel her
to pass penal laws to guard and protect those perfect, ascertained,
constitutional rights from the illegal invasion of 'abank created by
any other state. If this power exists at all, it can be shown, and
the authority' by which it acts. But not even a reasonable pretence
for any such power or auth6rity has been shown. The conclusion
must therefore be, that Alabama, as an independent foreign state;
owing no duty, nor being under, any obligation to either of the
states, by whose corporations she was invaded; was the sole and
exclusive judge of what was proper or improper to be done; and
consequently had a right to examine and determine whether she
'gould grant a favour to either of those states without injury to herself; unless indeed there be a controlling power in this Court, derived from some provision of the Constitution of the United States.
As none such has been set up, or relied upon in the opinion of the
majority of the Court; for the present I have a right to conclude'that
none such exists. And without considering any of the minor points
discussed in the argument, or noticed in the opinion, 1idismiss the
5abject.
