PARTE JESSE HOYT, COLLECTOR OF THE PORT

OF NEw YORK.

Mandamus. The Supreme Court will not issue a mandamus to the dlistrict 'judge of the
southern district of New York, in a case in which the district judge decided that the
custody of goods, wares, and merchandise, proceeded against aftei a seizure by the collector of the port of New York, was in the marshal of the district, after process had issued
by order of the Court against the goods. The mandamus was asked fof, after an argument before the Supreme Court, to show that the custody of the goods was to continue in
the collector of the port. The Court said: This is neither more nor less thap an application for an order to reverse the solemn judgment of the district judge, in a matter clearly
within the jurisdiction of the Court; and to substitute'Another judgment in its stead.
A writ of mandamus is not a proper process to correct an eroneous judgment or decree rendered in an inferior Court. That is a matter which is properly examinable on a writ of
error, or on an appeal to the proper appellate tribunal. Nor can the Supreme Court issue
a mandamus to the District Court, on the ground that it is necessary for the exercise of its
appellate jurisdiction ; for if there is any appellate jurisdiction in this case, it is direct and
immediate to the Circuit Court of the southern district of New York. It has been repeatedly declared by this Court, that it will not, by mandamus, direct a judge to make a
particular judgment in a suit, but will only require him to proceed to render judgment.
By the sixty-ninth section of the collection act of 1799, chapter 128, the goods or merchandise seized under that act are to be put into and remain in the custody of the collector, or such other persons as he may appoint for that purpose, no longer than until the
proper proceedings are instituted under -the 89th section of the same act, to ascertain
whether they are forfeited or not; and as soon as the marshal seizes the -goods, under
the proper process of the Court, the marshal is entitled to the sole and exclusive custody
thereof, subject to the future orders of the Court.

ON the 22d December, 1838, an information was filed by the district attorney, on behalf of the United States, in the District Court
of the United States, for the southern district of New York, alleging
that the goods therein described had been seized by the collector as
forfeited to the use of the United States, for violation of the revenue
laws, &c. &c.; and prayed the usual process and monitioji of the
Court, and the condemnation of the said goods.
By a standing rule of the Court, adopted on the 19th of October,
1801, it was ordered, "that whenever the attorney of the district
shall, in behalf of the United States, file a libel ot information with
the clerk of this Court, against any vessel, goods, "r property seized
as forfeited to the use of the United States, for breach of any act
of the said United States, it shall be the duty of the clerk to cause,
of course, a monition to issue to the marshal of the district, directing the said marshal to attach the said vessel, goods, or property,
and to detain the same in his custody, until the further order of the
Court in the premises; and to cause due notice to be given or published of such seizure."
Pursuant to this rule, and the uniform practice of the Court since
its adoption, the clerk, on filing the information in this cause, issued
a monition and warrant directing tjie marshal to attach the property
specifically described in the information, and to detain the same in
his custody until the further order of the Court respecting the same,
and to give notice, &c. &c.

him, or by the officers of the customs, and to prevent the enforcement of the process issued in this case; filed, in the District Court.
the following paper:

The United'States"
vs.
Sundry packages of goods.
Motion by Jesse Hoyt, collector of customs for the port of New
York, that the clause of the monition issued in this cause, by which
the marshal is directed to detain the goods, attached by virtue of
said monition, in his custody, until the further order of the Court
respecting the same, be quashed and stricken out, on the ground that
the said clause is repugnant to the 69th section of the act "'to regulate the collection of duties on imports and tonnage," approved
March 2, 1799, and is, therefore, illegal and void; or that the said
monition be so reformed and amended, that the said goods, &c., remain in the custody of the said collector, or such person as he shall
appoint for that purpose, until the proceedings rommenced for the
forfeiture of the said goods shall be determined, and it be judicially
ascertained whether the same have been forfeited or not, as required
by the said 69th section of the act above named.
By the consent of Mr. Butler, the district attorney of New York,
the motion was submitted to the District Court for its decision.
The District Court, on the 8th of January, 1839, denied the motion
of the collector.
On the 17th of January, 1839, the following agreement was entered into) by the collector of New York, and the marshal of the
southern district, with the assent and approbation of the district
judge:
It is agreed that a motion for a mandamus, to be directed to the
district judge of the United States, for the southern district of New
York, commanding him1. To vacate the order entered in the said District Court on the
eighth day of January, instant, denying the motion of the above
named relator, referred.to in the said order; and,
2. To grant the prayer of said motion; or so much thereof and in
such 'form as this Court shall adjudge and direct, be brought on to
be argued in thb Supreme Court of the United States, on any motion day when counsel can be,heard; without any rule to show cause,
or any application for such rule, on the facts stated in the opinion of
the district judge, delivered on the eighth day of January, instant.
Mr. Grundy, Attorney General, stated that this was, in point of
fact, a controversy between the' collector of the port of New York,
and the marshal of the southern district, and as the United States
had no interest in the question involved, except so far as their share
of t1he proceeds of forfeited goods might be affected by it, in common
with the parties entitled to the other shares, he would leave it to be

presented by the dounsel of te parties, for the consideration of the
Court.
Mr. Gilpin, counsel for Mr. Hoyt, the collector, moved for the
mandamus, according to the agreement between the parties'; and
contended that the District Court for the southern district of New
York, ought to have amended its process, by striking out that part
of it which authorizes the marshal to take goods seized for a violation of the revenue laws into his custody, before it is ascertained
whether they are forfeited or not.
The question is one of general concern, and the practice ought to
be settled by this tribunal, so that uniformity may exist thoughout all
the ports of the United States; and the duties of two classes of responsible public functionaries be satisfactorily ascertained. But it
is also a matter of individual concern to the collector and officers of
the revenue. Their share of the proceeds of condemned goods is
given to them as the. reward of vigilance and fidelity. To guard
the rights of the citizen, however, it can only be obtained after litigation; often protracted and expensive. It is always attended with
the risk of incuring damages by improper or over-zealous conduct.,
Unnecessarily to diminish this share, is, therefore, a hardship to the
revenue officer, and contrary to, the spirit of the revenue laws.
Goods, thus seized; often lay for long periods before they are con.
demned. If they remain in the public warehouse, heavy charges are
avoided; if delivered to the marshal, the cost of custody will, in
many cases, exceed or equal the whole value of the property.
Again, if the collector seizes the goods without just cause, he must
return them to the owner; he is answerable for so doing; to remove
them from his custody, is to add to his risk, if not to subject him to
actual loss. This question, therefore, is one involving very important private interests; one that the collectors and revenue officers must
desire to see settled by a tribunal from which there is no appeal.
It is not a complicated question. It rests entirely on the proper
construction of a few acts of Congreos. It appears to have been
the intention of Congress, as manifested in these acts, to leave all
goods, wares, and merchandise in the custody of the revenue officers,
until it was ascertained by a judicial judgment, whether they were
forfeited or not.
By the first collection act of 31st July, 1789, section twenty-six,
(1 Story's Laws, 24,) the positive duty is imposed on collectors
and revenue officers to seize vessels and goods liable to be forfeited
for violating the revenue laws; and this provision is repeated in,
the subsequent laws of the 4th August, 1790, (1 Story's Laws, 148,)
and of 2d March, 1799, (1 Story's Laws, 633,) the last qf which is
now in force. The same acts (1 Story's Laws, 28, 155, 653,) require the collector to cause suit to be instituted, immediately, in all
such cases of seizure, and to have it prosecuted to effect, according
to the mode prescribed by law. This mode is pointed out in the
ninth section of th.e-judiciary, act of 24th September, 1789, (1 Story's

282

SUPREME COURT.
[Ex parte Jesse Hoyt.]

Laws, 56,) which directs all seizures under laws of impost to be
included in the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the District
Court; and in the second section of the process act of 29th September, 1789, (1 Story's Laws, 67,) which directs that the forms
and modes of proceeding in cases within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the District Court, shall be 'according to the
course of the civil law. This course is the filing of a libel, and the
issuing, from the Court, the proper process for placing the goods
under its cognizance; giving notice to claimants ; and ascertaining the fact of such a violation of the laws as pro uces forfeiture. The particular ofhcer in whose custody the goods areplaced when under the cognizance of the Court, forms no part of
the "course of the civil law ;" it may be one person or another, as
usage, the rules of Court, or statute may prescribe. In this case it
is not left to usage or judicial regulation; if it were, they would
certainly sustain the right of the collector: for it appears to be unquestioned, that in all ports of the United States, goods seized for
forfeiture are, and from the beginning of the government always
have been, left in the public warehouse until condemnation or release; and that even in New York, where the clause now objected
to is found in the process. The actual removal'of the goods therefrom has not been required by the Court, or permitted in practice.
But it is positively prescribed by law, and always has been a part
of the revenue system, "that all goods, wares, or merchandise,
which shall be seized by virtue of the revenue laws, shall be put
into and remain in the custody of the collector, or such other person
as he shall appoint for that purpose, until the proceedings required
by law are had to ascertain whether the same are forfeited or not."
This explicit enactment is found in the law of 31st July, I89,
(I Story's Laws, 24,) in that of 4th August, 1790; (I Story's Laws,
148,) and finally, in that of 2d March, 1799, (1 Story's Laws, 633;)
from which time no provision whatever, in conflict with it, can be
found. A point that is thus so clearly established by the positive
words of the statute; which is so consonant with the whole -revenue system and the interests of parties secured by that system;
which is sanctioned by long, general, and unquestioned usage;
would seem scarcely to need the added weight of judicial interpretation. This, however, is to be found in support of the right of
the collector, but never to the contrary. It is decided by the Circuit Court of Massachusetts, in the case of Burke vs. Trevitt, (1 Mason, 100,) that "by the act of 2d March, 1799, all goods seized
under that act are to be put into and remain in the custody of the
collector or his agent; that the goods are still in contemplation of law
in the custody of the Court: and that the collector remains as much
responsible to the Court for the property, and as much bound to
obey its decrees and orders, as the marshal is as to property confided
to his care; the collector is, quoad hoc, the mere official keeper for
the Court."
In opposition to this series of statutory regulation, sanctioned by

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

283

[Ex parte Jesse Hoyt.]

judici&I decision, nothing is produced to sustain the right of the
marshal to take the possession of the goods immediately after the
institution of suit, except the words of the fourth section of the act
of 8th May, 1792, (1 Story's Laws, 259,) which prescribes the fees
and allowances to marshals. It says, that "the marshal shall have
the custody of all vessels and goods seized .by any officer of the
revenue, and shall be allowed such compensation therefor" as the
Court may judge reasonable."
Now, not to advert to this section,
as having relation to the marshal's compensation, and to the custody
of goods, which, as the executive officer of the Courti he is entitled
to after it has been "ascertained whether they are forfeited or not ;"
it is sufficient to remark, that this law was passed in 1792, and that
the provision now 'relied on was made in 1799, and has never been
since changed or interfered with. If the act of 1792 ever applied
to the custody before judgment, it is unquestionably repealed.
Mr. Wright, for the marshal of the southern district of New-York,
contended, that the District Court of NeWv York had properly decided
the question before that Court.
The 69th section of the act-of Congress of March 2 1799, does
not repeal the first clause of the fourth section of the act of the 8th
of May, 1792. The words of the act of the 8th of May, 1792, are,
"That the marshal shall have the custody of all vessels and goods
seized by any officer of the revenue, and shall be allowed such compensation therefor as the Court may judge reasonable." Act for regulating process in the Courts of the United States, 2 Laws U. S. 301.
The words of the act of 2d March, 1799 are, "That all goods,
wares, or merchandise, which shall be seized by virtue of this act,
shall be put into, and remain in. the custody of the collector, or such
other person as he shall appoint for that purpose, until such proceedings shall be had as by this act are required, to ascertain whether the same have been forfeited or not;" 3 Laws U. S. 199.
Section 69 of "The act to regulate the collection of duties on imposts and tonnage."
The custody intended in these two statutes is different; and, properly understood, the one does not conflict with the other. The
possession and custody of the marshal is a possession and custody,
obtained through the power and proctess of the Court, and not otherwise. The possession and custody of the collector is a possession
and custody obtained through tle power given to him, and the
other officers of the revenue, "or persons specially appointed," by
the collector, naval officer, or surveyor, to seize property imported
in violation of the revenue laws. These seizures are always without process, unless it be the process of a search 'warrant.
The act of 1799 is to regulate the collection of duties, &c. See
see. 68 and 70. Also sec. 24 and 26 of act of 1789. Also sec.48
and 50 of act of 1790. Also sec. 27 of act of 1793.
The possession and custody of the collector is to continue "until
such proceedings shall be had as by, 'his act (the act of 1799) are

SUPREME COURT.
[Ex parte Jesse Hoyt.]

required, to ascertain whether the same (the property, whatever it
may be) have been forfeited or not."
The first of these "proceedings," according to the uniform practice of the Court, is the preparation and filing of the libel. The
second "proceeding" is, the issuing of the monition and warrant of
attachment, in pursuance of the prayer of the libel. The third is
the delivery of the monition and warrant to the marshal; and the
fourth "proceeding" is, the service of this process by the marshal.
And here the possession of the articles, the subject of the information, by the marshal begins, and that of the collector ends.
Are the "proceedings" to be carried to judgment of acquittal or
condemnation, before the ":custody" of the collector can be discharged? Does the act itself permit this construction ? "And the
collector, Within whose district the seizure shall' be made, or for
feiture incurred, is hereby enjoined to cause suits for the same to be
commenced without delay, and prosecuted to effect," &c. 3 Laws
of U. S. 221. sec. 89. Can the collector do this without'surrendering the articles proceeded against to the custody of the Court, and
its officer-the "custody" confided to him by the sixty-ninth section
of the act of Congress.? The'act declares, section 89, 3 Laws
U. S. 221; "And all ships or vessels, goods, wares, or merchandise,
which shall become forfeited in virtue of this act, shall be seized,
libelled, and prosecuted, as aforesaid, in the proper Court having
cognizance thereof; which Court shall cause fourteen days' notice
to be given of such seizure and libel," &c. Will it be contended
that the "seizure" here directed, is any other than a seizure by
process of law?
The Court is authorized, at any time after the property has been
seized and prosecuted, upon the application of a claimant, to appoint
appraisers to value the property; to take from the claimant a bond
with surety for the amount of the valuation; and to order the possession and custody. of the property to be surrendered to him. This
is to be done beforp judgment of acquittal or forfeiture, and this
must terminate the custody of the collector.
Again: The marshal is directed to sell the property at auction,
and to pay the proceeds into Court, incase it has not been bonded;
and judgment of forfeiture and condemnation shall pass against it.
If the property is not in the custody of the marshal during the proceedings, how can he be held responsible-for finding it to sell?
If perishable property be seized, the power of the Court to order
a sale, pendente lite, upon the application of the district attorney,
and of the claimant, if any there be, and on the application of the
district attorney alone, if no claimant appear; cannot be doubted or
denied: and yet this could not be done without putting an end to
the custody of the collector.
Nor is the collector bound by a mere order of the Court, without
notice, and an opportunity to show cause against its being obligatory
upon him. He is not an officer of the Jourt. If he is the keeper
pendente lite of the goods "seized," he is so by the force of the

,JANUARY TERM, 1839.

[Ex parte Jesse HoyL]

statute, not by the order of the Court, or -by any process issued by
it, or under its authority.
Did Congress in'tend, by the passage of the 69th section of the
act of 2d March, 1799, to repeal the first clause of the fourth
section of the act of the 8th of May, 1792 ? The provision of the
25th section of the act of 1789 was identical with that now existing
and in force in the sixty-ninth section of the act of 1799, except the
words, " or such other person as he shall appoint for that purpose."
That act read: "That all goods, wares, and merchandise, which
shall be seized by virtue of this act, shall be put into and remain in
the custody of the collector, until," &c. 2 Laws U. S. 24. The act
to regulate the collection of duties, &c. passed July 31, 1789.
The twenty-fifth section of the last named act was superseded by
the forty-ninth section of that of 1790, which is perfectly identical
with the sixty-ninth 'section of the act of 1799, which superseded
this. Here the words, "or such other person as he shall appoint
for that purpose," are first introduced; and the whole section is
literally copied in the sixty-ninth section of the act 0f 1799. 2 Laws
U. S. 163. Act of 4th Aug. 1790, "To provide more effectually for
the collection of duties."
Did the first clause of the fourth section of the act of 1792 repeal
this forty-ninth section of the act of the 4th August, 1790? Would
Congress have so legislated, intentionally, as to have repealed that
section by this clause by implication, and then have repealed this
clause by implication by the re-enactment of'that ? Was the marshal
to have the custody before process? If the sixty-ninth section of the
act of 1799 is to be construed as a repeal of the first clause of the
fourth section of the act of 1792, who, between that 'time and the
present has had the right to the "1custody"- of" vessels" seized ?
If it were necessary to avoid this' inconvenient construction,
would not the Court be justified in saying that, quoad the progecution, the marshal is the "other person" appointed by the collector
to take the custody of the property. The collector is the prosecutor.
It is, by the eighty-ninth section of this act, made his duty to prosecute "without delay ;" while the sixty-ninth section gives the custody of the property to him, "or such other person as he shall
appoint for that purpose;" If then the course of the "proceedings"
requires that the marshal shall have the "custody" of the property
by virtue of process, does he not, by the act of prosecution, quoad
hoc, make him that "other person ?" Burke vs. Trevitt, 1 Mason's
Rep. 96-100. Is it policy, further than is necessary, to continue
property seized in this summary manner, in the hands, possession,
and custody of a party in interest ? The collector is such a party,
he being entitled to a share of the proceeds if the property is
forfeited.
Mr. Gilpin, in reply
The argument against this motion does not deny ihe legal right
of the collector to the custody of goods seized, but confines it to the

286

SUPREME COURT.
[Ex paxte Jesse Hoyt.]

custody merely incident to the seizure,,and makes it expire with the
commencement of proceedings for the condemnation.
Such a construction is contrary to the plain language of the sixtyninth section of the act of 1799. That act is the latest; subsequent
to all 'others cited; its provisions are the actual law, no matter
whether or not they conflict with any that are previous. If they
are so clear as to leave no doubt, there is an end of the case. When
the whole section is read together, there seems no room for doubt.
"All goods, wares, and merchandise, which shall be seized by virtue- of this act, shall be put into and remain in the custody of the
collector, or such other person as he shall appoint for that purpose,
until such proceedings shall be had as by this act are required, to
ascertain whether the same are forfeited or not; and if it shall be
adjudged that they are not forfeited, they shall be forthwith restored
to the owner or owners, claimant or claimants thereof; and if any
person or, persons shall conceal or buy any goods, wares, or merchandise, knowing them to be liable to seizure by this act, such
person or persons shall, on conviction thereof, forfeit and pay a sum
double the amount or value of the goods, wares, or merchandise, so
concealed or purchased." Is it not evident that this section is
meant to provide for the custody of the goods from the moment
they are seized, as liable for forfeiture, up to that when they are
adjudged to be forfeited or restored ? Had the law meant that the
custody should be changed during this interval, would it not have
been so stated in this section? It provides for their custody until
" proceedings are had to ascertain whether they are forfeited, and
if they are adjudged not to be forfeited," they are to be given up.
Is it possible to construe the sentence otherwise than as saying that
the judgment of the Court is the proceeding by which the forfeiture
is to be ascertained? If the law of 1792 were not in existence,
could any one doubt for an instant that this would be adniitted
without question? If so, it ought now to be admitted, for this is a
subseqtient statutory provision, to be ascertained from its express
language; not by reference to a previous law, which cannot control
or affect it.
But the construction contended for is not only contrary to the
language of the sixty-ninth section; it is contrary to the whole
scope of the law, of 1799. That law embraces all proceedings relafive to imported goods. It provides for all cases that occur from
the time of their arrival to the time of their final disposition, whether
that be by their delivery to the importer, or by their sale as forfeited.
The duties of the collector, of the various revenue officers, and of ihe
Court, are particularly set forth, Is it jossible the custody of goods
seized and waiting adjudication 'should'not. be. explicitly provided
for ? Yet the only provision is'that which gives it to the collector.
It is possible the law intended-to give it to the marshal, when there
is no provision to that effect? The duties of the collector in making
seizure and instituting proceedings, are minutely stated; the,,whole
of these proceedings, whether by the Court, the clerk, or the claim-

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

287

[Ex parte Jesse Hoyt.]

ant, are prescribed; the sale, if the goods are condemned, is, by the
express words of the law, to be made by the marshal. There is no
omission to assign explicitly specific duties to the several officers, in
every successive stage, from the moment the goods are imported; or
-to provide for each contingency that may occur in regard to them.
The law of 1799 is elaborately drawn for these purposes. Would
it not then be a total violation of its whole scope, so to construe the
sixty-ninth section as, in the first place, to prevent it from embracing,
as its plain tenour would do, the custody of the goods up to the
time of judgment; and then, having done this, to confer that custody
on an officer to whom it is never given in the same law, although
that law was evidently intended to provide for and assign the specific-duties of every officer? Yet to this result the opposite argument necessarily leads.
Nor is the coristructiot contended for more opposed to the express language and general scope of these statutory provisions, than
it is to the whole spirit of'the revenue system of the United States,
as regards imported goods subject to impost duties. The leading
and distinct feature of that system is, to leave all goods, subject to
duty, in the actual custody of the collector, until the duties are paid
or secured. Up to that time the government, through its revenue
officer, keeps its lien-holds its possessioti. The moment a vessel
arrives within the waters of the United States, the collectpr, or his
subordinate officer, takes possession of the goods; he ascertains the
impost duties on them; he examines whether they are liable to
forfeiture; he provides warehouses for their safe keeping; if they
are seized for forfeiture, he has legal proceedings instituted; if delivered to the claimant on bond, he sees that additional bonds for the
duties are taken; he sells them if the duties are not paid or secured
within nine months; his permit is necessary for their delivery. To
allow the marshal to take them, from the public warehouse, pendente lite, is at direct variance with this whole system,. and for no
corresponding benefit. It-deprives the government of its security
for the duties; it substitutes an officer, having no connexion with
the revenue, for him who is expressly charged with that duty, and
with the preservation of the best security-the goods themselvesuntil that revenue is paid. The omission of this law to give to the
collector the custody of vessels, as well as goods, confirms this view.
It does not direct him to retain the custody of vessels seized, for they
are not liable to impost duties; they'are not articles affording a
revenue; they do not come within the scope of the revenue system.
It is true 'they are subject to payments for tonnage, called duties;
but these are in fact mere port charges, in no way resembling impost duties,.,r requiring the same regulations. The very omission,
therefore, to include vessels in the provisions of the act giving the
custody of goods to the collector, would seem to show that those
provisions were made with reference to the revenue system. If so,
they can only be consistent with it, by construing them in the manner contendd for-by the collector.

288

SUPREME COURT.
[Ex parte Jesse Hoyt.]

The argument in support of the opposite construction, and which
goes to limit the custody of the collector to the mere possession incident to the seizure, does not controvert any of these grounds. It
relies olely on an endeavour to show that other provisions of the
act of 1799 are inconsistent with the custody of the collector after
the institution of legal proceedings. One point of the opposite- argument is, that the suit is to he "prosecuted to effect ;" and that
this cannot be done without surrendering the goods to the custody
of an officer of the Court; and that the collector is not an officer of
the Court, or bound to obey ts order. To this it may be answered,
in the first place, that the custody of an officer of the Court is not
necessary to the effectual prosecution of the proceedings for forfeiture; those proceedings consist in the ascertainment of certain facts
independent entirely of the custody of the goods, until their restoration or sale is decreed by a judgment, when the law provides the
officer and the mode of effectuating that judgment, whichever it
may be; in the mean time it is sufficient if the law provides that
the goods are safely kept by any person to answer to the judgment:
but in the second plaee, the collector is an officer of the Court, and
so constituted by this wrery law, so long as the proceedings are depending. In the words of the Circuit Court of Massachusetts in
Burke vs. Trecvitt, 1 Masoi'. 100, the collector "is the, mere official
keeper of the Court." Another point of the argument is, that as
notice must be given by the Court of the seizure of the goods, such
seizure must be one' made under process of the Court; the very
words of the law cited to sustain this constructibn seem to controvert it, for they speak of the seizure of.which notice is to
be given as anterior to the libel; when it is admitted that the
only seizure on the process of the Court must be subsequent to
•the libel; for on the allegations of the libel all its process is
founded
Nor is it possible to sustain 'this distinction by refererice' to the words of the statute; it speaks constantly of seizure
for forfeiture, but in every instance treats it as an act of the Collector; never of the marshal. Besides-the distinction is unnecessary
to secure the rights of any persons for whose benefit the notice is
to be given. Again, it is said that before judgment the Court may
direct the delivery of the goods on bond, or their sale if perishable;
and that either of these acts ends the collector's custody, It is not
apparent how either of these acts of the Court conflict with that
custody, either to the injury of the collector, or of the security of
the government; because in the first instance the act is expressly
authorized and it is provided that full security both for the value of
the goods and the amount of duties shall be previously given; in the
other there is certainly no authority given to the Court by any law,
but if it were exercised doubtless it would be attended with the
same disposition of the proceeds of the sale. If therefore these
acts do terminate the collector's custody, before judgment, it is only
by the substitution of a security or other property equal in value,
and as much under his control; this is not the case if the custody

be taken from him by the preliminary process of the marshal's attachment. Nor does the provision of the law, which directs the
sale after condemnation to be made by the marshal, seem to conflict
with the construction contended for by the collector; on the contrary the express designation of the marshal, in this instance, and
of the collector in the other, would seem to sanction his' construction. But the sale is an executive act of the Court, anid properly
done by its executive officer, who is bound to make his return immediately; this is in no respect similar to the custody of the goods
before condemnation.
One point of the opposite argument remains to be noticed. It
is said that'if the act of 1799 is construed as a repeal of that
of 1792, it will leave no provision for the custody of vessels; and
also that the latter act must have been equally a repeal of those
of 1789 and 1790, which would remove all provisions for the
custody of goods before process-a construction, it is alleged, so
inconvenient that it would justify the Court, if necessary, in order
to obviate it, to consider the marshal as one of the "other persons"
to whom. the collector might himself confide the custody. To this
argument the answer is, that the act of 1799 is not a repeal of the
act of 1792, nor was.the latter a repeal of those of 1789 and 1790.

The act of 1792 is an act generally explaining the duties and regulating the fees of the marshal; the others are acts elaborately
arranging the revenue system; the clause in the act of 1792 is subsidiary to the others; it refers to such custody of goods as it may
-be necessary for the marshal to have as an executive officer of the
Court, but not in conflict with the revenue system or arrangements.
But even if the act of 1799 were a repeal of that of 1792, it would

not, as is contended, leave no..provision for the custody of vessels;
because they are not included among the articles placed by the
former act in charge of the collector, and therefore as to them
the act of 1792 remains unrepealed, and gives the custody to the
marshal.
Mr. Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.This is the case of a motion made by the collector of New York
for a mandamus to be directed to the district judge of the southern
district 6f New York, under the following circumstances. The collector, on the 26th of December last, made a motion in a certain cause
of seizure then depending before- the said judge, that the clause of the
common monition, issued in that cause, by which (according to the
conimon practice in such casas,) the marshal is' directed to detain the
goods attached by virtue of the said monition in his custody, until
the further order of the Court, be quashed and stricken out; on the
ground that the said clause is repugnaht to the sixty-ninth section
of the act of 1799, ch. 128, entitled, "An act to regulate the collection of duties on imports and tonnage ;" or that the said monition
be so reformed and amended, that the said-goods remain in the'custody of the said collector, or such person as he shall appoint for

thatpurpose, until the proceedings commenced for the forfeiture of
the said goods shall be determined, and it be judicially ascertained,
whether the same have been forfeited or not, as required by the
said sixty-ninth section of the act. The district judge after a full
hearing pronounced an elaborate opinion, reviewing the whole
series of laws on the subject, and refused to grant the motion. The
present motion is for'a mandamus to compel him to vacate -the order
enying the' original motion of the collector.
We are of Qpinion that this 'is, in no just sense, a case for a writ
of mandamus. This Court has authority given to it by the thirteenth section of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20 to issue writs of
mandamus in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law
to any Courts appointed under the authority of the United States.
The, present 4pplication is not warranted by any such principles and
usages of law. It is neither more nor less than an application fof
an order to reverse the. solemn judgment of the district judge, in a
matter clearly within the jurisdiction of the Court, and to substitute another judgment in its stead. Now a writ of mandamus is
-not a proper process to correct an erroneous judgment or decree
rendered in an inferior Court. That is properly matter which is
examinable uporr a writ of 'error or an appeal, (as the case may require,) to the proper appellate tribunal. Neither can this Court
issue the writ upon the ground that it is necessary for the exercise
of its own appellate jurisdiction; for the proper appellate jurisdiction, if any' in this case,.is direct and immediate to the Circuit Court
for the southern district of New York. It has been repeatedly declared by this Court that it will not, by mandamus, direct a judge
what judgment to enter in a suit; but only will require him to proceed to render judgment. The case of the Life and Fire Insurance
of New York vs. Adams in 8 Peters' Rep. 291; and 9 Peters' Rep.
573,'is directly in point.
But, as there appears to have been some diversity of construction
in the different districts of the United States, of the laws on this
subject, and as it is a matter of general concern throughout all the
comhmercial districts, and' applicable to the daily practice of the
Courts, and the point has been fully argued, we thinfk it right to say,
that we are of -opinion that the construction of the laws of the
United States, maintained by the district judge in his opinion, is the
correct one,, to wit, that by the sixty-ninth section of the collection'
act of 1799, ch. 128, the goods, wares, and merchandise seized under
that act are to be put into and remain in the custody of the collector, or such other persons as he shall appoint for that purpose, no
longer than until the proper proceedings are had under the eighty'ninth section of the same act to ascertain. whether they are forfeited or not; and that as soon as the marshal seizes the same goods
under the proper procesg of the Court, the marshal is entitled to the
sole and exclusive custody thereof, subject to the future orders of
theThe
Court.
motion for the mandamus is denied.

Mr. Justice BALDWIN concurred with the Court, in the opinion
that this is not a case for a mandamus. The result of this is that
the case is coram non judice. Any opinion which may be given
on other points in the case cannot be binding in any case. He was
not willing to decide a, question, when it was not properly before
the Court.
