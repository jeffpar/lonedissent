JANUARY TERM, 1839.

THE STATE oF RHODE ISLAND VS. THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS.
The State of Rhode Island, on leave granted at January Term, 1838, to amend a bill previously filed by the state against the state of Massachusetts, amended the bill at this
term, by inserting in it references to papers filed t the term of 1838. The state of Massachusetts was allowed until the term of 1840 to answer.
The rules which govern Courts of- Equity as to the allowance of time for filing an answer and other proceedings in suits between individuals, will not be applied by the Supreme Court to controversies between states of the Union. The parties In such cases,
must, in the nature of things, be incapable of acting with the promptness of an individual.

MR. SOUTHARD, for the complainants, stated that the stake of
Rhode Island, with the consent of the Court, obtained at last term.
had amended the bill filed in this case; and he moved the Court
for a rule on the state of Massachusetts to answer. within a short
time, so that the case might be disposed of during the term.
Mr. Webster stated, that, although not authorized to appear in
the case, he thought It proper to say that the opinions of the Court
delivered at the last term in this cause had been submitted to the
government of Massachusetts. It was a short time before the adjournment of the legislature of the state that they were commilnicated to them. The subject will be' again presented by the
governor to the legislature, at the session now held; and it is expected that some action upon it will take place. In the posture in
which the case stood at the last term of this Court, the attorney
general of the state of Massachusetts has not thought it proper to
do any thing. The movements of such bodies, as the defendants
in this case, are slow.
Mr. Hazard had no objection to an allowance of time to the defendants to answer. He had a strong impression that he had seen
some proceedings of the legislature of Massachusetts, at its lafst
session in ]838, by which the direction of this case was left to the
counsel employed by the state. He did not think that the slow
movements of such bodies should be allowed, when other parties
are concerned: He desired that a time for the filing of an answer,
by the state of Massachusetts, should'be definitely fixed.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.A motion was, made by the complainant on Saturday last for an
order on the defendant to answer the amended bill of the complainant, on or before the 26th day of the present month of January.
In d ciding upon this motion it is necessary to refer to the orders of
the Court heretofore passed in this case, and to see what steps have
been taken uider them.
At the last term leave was given to Rhode Island to withdraw
the general replication filed in the case, and to amend the bill: the
amendment to be nade on or before the first Monday of August

last. At the same term, upon 'the motion of the counsel for Massachusetts, leave was. granted I o withdraw the plea which the defendant had filed, a-nd also to strike out the appearance of Massachusetts to the suit.
Npthing has since been done by the defendant under this leave,
for reasons which have been stated at the bar. And as the appearance of Massachusetts has not yet been withdrawn, and as Rhode
Island. has a right to the usugl orders to enable that state to proceed
in the suit, the Court in passing them must look to the condition of
the case as it appears on tile record, and consider Massachusetts as
,still in Court, and as appearing in the case.
When the motion was made at the last term to amend the bill,
two documents which Rhode Island desired to -introduce into the
cause were filed with the motion; but the leave to amend, was
general, and not confined to the papers then filed. Nothing appears
to'have been done by the complainant until the second day of the
present term, when the bill was amended by inserting in it the proper
allegations, in relation to the two papers above mentioned; and
adding also certain interrogatories in relation to sundry matters
charged in the bill, which the complainant prays that the defendant
may be required to answer. The amendment, therefore, was not
mide until the second day of the present term. The defendant could
riot-have answered until it was made; and, consequently, is not in
default for not answering. The question now is, what time ought
to be given?
From the character of the parties, and the nature of the controversy, we cannot, without committing great injustice, apply to this
case the rules as to time, which govern Courts of Equity in suits
between individuals. In the last mentioned cases, the material allegations- in the bill are comparatively few in number, and' rest in
the personal knowledge of the individual who is to put in his answer. But a case like this, and one too of so many years standing,
the paities, in the nature of things, must be incapable of acting
wili the promptness of an individual. Agents must be employed,
and much time may b6 required to search for historical dopuments,
and to arrange and collate them, for the purpose of presenting to
the Court the true grounds of the defence. It is impossible -for
the Court to foresee what additional inquiries and explanations may
be found necessary in consequence of the new allegations and
documents introdiced into the bill; and the new interrogatories as
to the verity of variotis papers stated in the bill, which the defendant is now. calldd upon to answer. And as the Court have received the imendment of the complainant at the present term,
upon the leave granted at the last term, as herein before mentioned;
we think that the same time should be given to the defendant to
answer. The Court will, therefore, pass the following order.
The bill heretofore filed by Rhode Island in this case, having
been amended on the second day of the present term, it is ordered by

the Cottrt, that Massachusetts be allo~ved until the first Monday in
August next to elect whether that state- will withdraw its appearance, pursuant to the leave granted at January term, 1838; and if

the appearance of Massachusetts be withdrawn Within the time
above mentioned, that Rhode Island be, thereupon, at liberty to proceed ex parte.
And if the appearance of Massachusetts shall not be withdrawn
within the time above mentioned, it is then ordered, that the said
state answer the amended bill (f the 'complainant on or before the
second day of January term, 1840.
The motion made by the complainant on Saturday, the 19th of
the present month, is overruled.

Mr. Justice BALDWIn did not consider. the state of Massachusetts
before the Court; after.what had passed at the last term, not considering Massachusetts before the Court, he had taken no part ini
the order now made by the Court.'
