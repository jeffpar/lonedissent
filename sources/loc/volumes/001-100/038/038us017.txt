JANUARY TERM, 1839.

JOHN P. VAN NESS AND WILLIAM JONES, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR,,
vs. THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES, DEFENDANT IN ERROR.

The proceedings of the Courts of the state of Maryland, and the laws of that state prior to
the passing of laws by Congress providing for the government of the District of Columbia, were in full force and operation in that part of the district ceded by the state of Maryland, until Congress had legislated for the government of the District of Columbia; and
the decree of the Court of Chancery of Maryland, affecting property in the District of
Columbia, in a cause entertained in that Court, operated in the district until Cong%
took upon itself the government of the district.
The state of Maryland, and the United States, both intended -hat the suits pending in the
Courts of Maryland, should be proceeded in until the rights bf the parties should be defi
nitively decided; and that the judgments and decrees there made, should be as valid am
conclusive as if the sovereignty had not been transferred.
Congress, by the 13th section of the Act of February 27, 1801, placed judgments and de
crees thereafter to -be obtained in the state Courts of the state of which the District ot
Columbia had formed a part, on the same footing with judgments and. decrees, rendered
before.
If a guardian appointed by the Court of the state of Maryland, in a cause instituted aftet
Congress had legislated for the District of Columbia, had been ordered, by a decree of the.
Court, to-make a deed of lands within the district, and had died, or had refused to make
the colnveyance as ordered, the Court of the district would, on application, have been
bound to appoint another person to execute the deed; and would not have been authorized to open again and re-examine the questions whiclhia been decided in the Maryland
Court.
A deed was executed and acknowledged "W. M. Dpncanson, guardian for Marcia Burnes;
and acknowledged by the guardian "to be his act and deed as guardian aforesaid, and
thereby the act and deed of the said Marcia." This is a good. execution and acknowledgment.
-The Acts of the Assembly of Maryland, prescribing the mode in which deeds should be
acknowledged for the conveyance of real propetLy;-were adopted by Congres, hyi+he act
assumin~srisdiction in the District of Columbia, together with the other laws of Maryland then in. force. The Acts qf tha Assembly of Maryland relating to the acknowledgment of deeds, do not require that justices of the peace, or other 6fficers who have
authority to take acknowledgments, shall describe in their certificates their official character. Whenever it is established by proof that the. acknowledgment was made before
persons authorized. to take it, it must l8 piesumed to have been taken by them in their
official capacity.
The soundest reasons of justice and policy seem to demand that every reasonable intendment should be made to support the titles. of bona fide purchasers of real property.
In the declaration in. ejectment, various.demises were laid, and the verdict of this jury, and
'the judgment of the Circuit Court, were.entered on one of the demises only; and it was
contended that the Court ought not to have entered a judgtment on the issue found for
the plaintiff, but should have awarded a venire de novo.; and that this irregularity might,
be taken advantage of upon a, writ of error. Held: that if this objection had been made
in the Circuit Court on a motion i \arrest of judgment, the plaintiff would have been
permitted to strike out all the demi4; for 'the declaration but that on which the verdict
was given, The omission to strike' out these demises was only, therefore, an omission
of form; Antmd
the Act of Congress of 1789, ch. 20, sec. 32, expressly provides that no
judgment shall be reversed for any defect or want of form; but that the Courts of the,
united States shall proceed and give judgment, according as the right of the cause and
matter in law shall appear to them, without regarding any imperfections, defects, or
want of form in the judgment or course of proceeding, except that specially demurred to.

IN error to the Circuft Court of the United States for the District
of Columbia, sitting for the county of Washington.
This case came before the Court from the District of Columbia,
1;2

18

SUPREME COURT.
(Van Nesw et al. vs. The Bark of the United States.)

and was argued by Coxe for the plaintiffs in error, and by Mr. Key
for the defendants.
The case is fully stated in the following cpinion of the Court, delivered by Mr. Chief Justice TANEY.
This -case comes before' the Court upon a writ of error, directed
to the judges of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, sitting
for the county of Washington.
It is an, action of ejectment brought by the Bank of the United
States, to recover sundry lots of ground in the city of Washington.
The declaratio'n contains four demises, purporting to have been
made for the same premises by diflbrent lessors. The jury found
for the plaintiff upon one of the demises, but said nothing of the
other three; and the judgment of -the Court is entered, in like
manner, upon the particular demise on which the jury found for the
plaintiff; and' without taking any notice of the others.
At the.'trial ini the Circuit Court, it was admitted that David
!Burnes was seized in fee of the premises in controversy in his life
time, and that he died seized thereof, intestate, leaving Marcia Burnes
his only child and heiress at law. The plaintiff in the Court below,
then offered in evidence the exemplification of a record from the
Court of Chancery of Maryland, duly certified, by which it appeared
-that a certain Isaac Pollock, on the 17th of May, 1800, filed his bill
in the said Court, against Marcia Burnes, then an infant, in order to
obtain the conveyance of-a large number of lots, in the city of Washington, among which are the lots now in controversy; and claiming
the same under a contract made with David Bumes in his life time,
which. had not been carried into execution .by proper conveyances
at the time of his death. It further appeared, by the said record
from the Court of Chancery, that after various proceedings in the
case, the chancellor, on the 1st of Noveniber,.1800, decreed, that
upon the 'complainant's securing the purchase money to the satisfaction of the chancellor, 'the infant defendant, Marcia Burnes, should,
by William Mayne Duncanson, who had been appointed her guardian ad litem, convey the said lots to Pollock in fee. Afterwards,
further proceedings having been had, the Court, on the 26th of October, 1801, passed another decree, approving the security which
Pollock offered, (which was security on other real property,) and
directing that.,upon the complainant's executing mortgages for the
said .real property to the said Marcia, to secure the payment of the
purchase money, she should make the conveyance by her guardian,
as directed by the former decree. -It is unnecessary to state more
in detail the proceedings in the Maryland Court, because it is admitted that they were fully waranted by the laws of that state.
The plaintiff in the Circuit Court offered also in evidence, together
with this record, the deeds of mortgage executed by the said Pollock, pursuant to the aforesaid decree; and. also a deed of conveyance for the said lots from Marcia Burnes to Pollock, executed by
William Mayne Duncanson as her guardian.. This deed is datei

[Van Ness etal. -vs. The Bank of the United States.]

January 12, 1802, after Congress had assumed the government of
this district. The defendant in"the Circuit Court objected to the
admissibility and competency of all the evidence above stated; but
the objection was overruled by the Court, and this forms the first
exception.
In the further progress of the trial in the Circuit Court, various
other deeds were offered in evidence on the part of the plaintiff, in
order to show a title derived from Isaac Pollock; and among the
deeds thus offered, was one from Walter Smith to Benjamin Stoddart, dated March 5, 1807, acknowledged before Richard Parrott
and Thomas Corcoran. This acknowledgment was dated 1"District
of Columbia, WYashington Count!y, to wit ;" but it was not stated
in the acknowledgment, nor did it appear by that instrument, that
Parrott and Corcoran were justices of the peace for Washington
county; In point of fact, however, they were such justices, and it
is so admitted in the exception. The defendant objected to the admissibility of this deed; and this forms the substance of the second
exception; for although other papers are mentioned as objected to at
the time,' the only point raised here is upon the acknowledgment of
this deed.
Upon the first exception the plaintiffs in error insist that the deed
of conveyance from Marcia Burnes to Pollock, of the 12th of January, 1802, executed by her guardian as above mentioned, pursuant to the decree of the Maryland Court of Chancery, conveyed no
title ; that the sovereignty of Maryland over Washington county,
in this district, having terminated on the 27th of February, 180,
when Congress assumed the jurisdiction, the decree of the state
Court could not be 'executed without filing an exemplification of
the record, according to the Iqth section of the Act of Congress; which
provided for the government of the territory; and obtaining an
order for the execution of the decree, from the Chancery, Court of
this district.
This objection cannot oe sustained. The Act of Assembly of
Maryland, of 1791, ch. 45, which ceded the territory to the United
States, provided, "That the jurisdiction of the laws of the state
over the persons and property of individuals residing within the
limits of the cession, should not cease or determine until Congress
should by law provide for the government thereof under their jurisdiction." -The United States accepted the cession made by this
law of thp state; and the conditions above mentioned, therefore,
formed a part of the contract between the parties; and consequently
the laws of Maryland, and the jurisdiction of its Courts, continued
in full force, until Congress took upon itself the government of the
district: and as it was uncertain at what time the United States would
assume the jurisdiction, it must have been foreseen, that whenever
that event should happen many suits would be found pending and
undetermined in, the state Courts. It was certainly not the intention of the parties to the" vession, that sticl suits should abate-, and

20

SUPREME COURT.
[Van Ness et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

.that individuals who had rightfully instituted proceedings in the tribunals of the state, and incurred the expense and delays which are
unavoidable in,-such cases, should immediately upon the assumption
of jurisdiction by the United States, be compelled to abandon the
state Courts, and to begin anew in the Courts of the district. There
could be no reason of policy or justice for adopting such a measure :
and without stopping to inquire what, upon general principles of
law, would be the effect of a cession of territory, upon suits then
pending in the Cofirts of the ceding sovereignty, it is evident that in
this case, the state and the United States both intended that the suits
then pending in the Maryland tribunals should be proceeded in until
the rights of the parties should be finally decided; and that the judgments and decrees there made, should be as valid and conclusive as
if the sovereignty had not been transferred. We have already'stated
the provisions of the Act of Assembly of Maryland; and Congress in
assuming the jurisdiction recognised the rights of the state Courts,
and by the 13th section of the Act of February 27th, 1801, placed
judgments and decrees thereafter to be obtained in the state Courts,
in suits then pending, upon the same footing with judgments and
decrees rendered before. In either case, upon filing an exemplification of the proceedings had iti the state Courts, it authorized process of execution from the Distrigt Court of the United States, in
the same manner as if the judgment or decree had been there rendered. It makes no exception in -regard to real property situated
in the district; aid the rights to such -property then in litigation
are placed on the same ground with rights to per~onal property and
personal rights, and like them, are left 'to the final aoj1dication of
the Courts of the states. And although upon a strict and technical
construction of the 13tb section of the Act of Congress before referred to, it may be doubted whether this decree falls Within that
description of judgments and decrees for which provision is there
made; yet when the conditions :upon which the cession was made
by Maryland, and accepted by Congress, are considered, it is very
clear, that if the guardian appointed by the state -Court had died
or had refused to make the conveyance as ordered, the Court of
this district would, upon the application of Pollock have been
bound to appoint another person to execute the deed, -and would
not have been authorized to open again and re-examine the questions which had been decidedin the Maryland Court. And in,
such a case the conveyance to Pollock, by, the infant heiress of
BurnQs, would have Qwed its validity altogether to the decree of
the stdte tribunal; aind the title of the garantee would have received
no additional strength from the ordei of the District Court. We
can,-therefore, see no necessity for an order from that Court, when
the guardian appointed was *illing to execute it, and did execute
it, in obedience to the decree of the Maryland Court.
An objection has also been taken to the manner in which this
deed is s ed and acknowledged. It is signed, "W. M. Duncan-.
son, guardlaxi for Marcia Burnes ;" and he auinowledges it "to he;

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

21

[Van New at L. m.The Bank of the United State&]

his act and deed, as guardian as aforesaid, and thereby the act and
deed of the said Marcia."
It is argued that it should have been signed "Marcia Burnes, by
her guardian W. M. Duncanson," and in like manner acknOwledged "as her act and deed." This is a case, where no question
arises as to the manner of executing an authority given by private
persons, as to which the case of the lessee of Clark vs. Courtney,
5 Peters' R. 319. 349, 350, may justly apply. But is the case
where an authority is to be exercised under the depree of a Court
of Chancery, and therefore, where a liberal construction may and
ought to prevail. These two forms of signature and acknowledgment mean precisely the same 'thing; and as tiis deed substantially
conforms in the manner of its execution to the directions contained
in the decree, we consider it to be valid and effectual to convey the:
property therein mentioned.
Upon the second exception, the plaintiff in error contends, that
the acknowledgmenf of the deed from Walter Smith to Benjamin
Stoddart is defective, and the deed inoperative' because it does not
appear in the certificate of acknowledgment endorsed upon the deed
that the persons before whom it was made were at that time justices
of the peace for Washington couitiy ; and he insists that this omission cannot be. supplied by parol.
This question depends upon the construction of the Acts of Assembly of Mitryland which prescribe the mode in which deeds shall
be acknowledged for the conv.yance of real property; those Acts
of Assembly having been adopted by Congress in the Act assuming
jurisdiction, together with the other laws of Maryland then in force.
We perceive nothing in the Maryland Acts of Assembly which requires justices of the peace or other officers to describe in their cer .
tificates their official characters. It is no doubt usual and proper to
do so, because the statement in the certificate is prima faci6 evidence
of the fact, where the instrument has been received and recorded by
the proper authority. But such a statement is not made necessary
by the Maryland statutes. And whenever it is established by proof
that the acknowledgment was made before persons authorized to
take it, it must be presumed to have been taken by them in their
official Capacity; and when their official characters are sufficiently
shown by parol evidence, or by the admissions of the parties, we
see no reason for requiring more where the Acts of the Legislatuie
have not prescribed it. On the contrary, the soundest principles of
justice and policy would seem to emand that every reasonable intendmei4 should be made to support the titles of the bona fi e purchasers of real property; and this Court is not disposed to impair
their safety, by insisting upon matters of form, unless they were
evidently required by the legislative authority.
If the Maryland Courts had given a contrary construction to these
Acts of Assembly, we should of course feel it to be our duty to follow
their decision. But we do not find the point decided in any of the
Maryland reports. In the case of Connelly vs. Bowie, 6 lHar. &

22

SUPREME COURT.
[Van Ness et a]. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

John. 141, the certificate of acknowledgment did not state that the
persons by whom it was taken were justices of the peace, and, there
was no evidence in the record to prove their official character. The
deed was, therefore, clearly inadmissible; and it was so ruled by the
Court of Appeals. But it does not follow that the decision would
have been the same if parol evidence had been given to prove their
official character; and from the language of the Court in that case,
it may rather be inferred, that if other evidence had been offered, it
would have been deemed admissible to supply the omission in the
certificate .endorsed on the deed.
The objection made to the verdict and judgment applies altogether
to the form of the proceeding, and does not in any degree affect the
merits of the controversy. The verdict and the judgment, it appears,
are vpon one of the demises only; and it is insisted that as the jury
did not find all of the issues committed to them by the pleadings,
the Circuit Court ought not to have entered a judgment for the
plaintiff upon the issue found in his favour; but should have awarded
a venire de novo: and that this irregularity in the proceedings may be
taken advantage of upon a writ of error. It is not necessary to examine whether this objection could be maintained upon the practice
and decisions of the English Courts in relation to the action of ejectment.

For the Act of Congress of 178*9, ch. 20, sec. 32, expressly

provides, among other things, that no judgment shall bo reversed for
any defect or want of form; but that the Courts shall proceed'and
give judgment according as the right'of the cause and matter in law
shall appear to them, without regarding any imperfections, defects,
or want of form in the judgment or course of proceeding, except
those pecially demurred to. Now, the demises laid in a declaration
in ejectment are known to be fictitious and mere form; and if the
appellant had taken this objection in the Circuit Court, in arrest of
judgment, the plaintiff would undoubtedly have been permitted to
strike these demises from the declaration, and thus obviate the objection. The omission of the plaintiff to do this was nothing more
than an omission of a matter of form; and if, therefore, this proceeding in the Circuit Court should be held to be irregular it is nothing more than an error of form; and as such, furnishes no &round
for the reversal of the judgment.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore affirmed, with
costs.
This cause came on'to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holdin in and for the county of Washington, and was argued
by counsel. On consideration whereof, it, is flow here ordered and
adjudged by this Court, that the'judgment of the said Circuit Court
in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.
