The Spanssh Consul,

Claimant.
A foreign consul has a right to claim, or institute a proceeding, tn
rem, where the rights of property of his fellow-citizens are in question, without a special procuration from those for whose benefit he
acts.
But a consul caunot receive actual restitution of the res in controversy, without a special authority from the particular individuals
who are entitled.
A captvre made by citizens of the United States of property belonging to subjucts of a country in amity with the U. S. is unlawful,
wheresoever the capturing vessel may have been equipped, or by
whomsoever commissioned, and the property thus captured, if
brought within the neutral limits of this country, will be restored to
the original owners.

trary to the 14th article of the Spanish treaty, yet there is no doubt
that such acts are to be considered as piratical acts for all civil pur,
poses, and the offending parties cannot appear, and claim in our
Courts the property thus taken.
It seems, that the terms, " a State with which the said King shall be a
w'ar," in the 14th article of the treaty, include the South American
pyrovmces which have revolted against Spain.
But, however this may be, the Neutrality Act of June, 1797, c. i. extends the same prohibition, with all its consequences, to a colony
revolting, and making war against its parent country.
In the case of such an illegal capture, the property of the lawful owners cannot be forfeited, for a violation of the revenue laws of this
country, by the captors or by persons who have rescued the property from their possession.
The rights of salvage may be forfeited by spoliation, smuggling, or
other gross misconduct of the salvors.

from the Circuit Court of Rhode Island.
This was the case of a Spanish vessel and cargo,
stranded on Block Island, and there seized by the
officers of the customs. An information on behalf
of the United States, was filed in the District Court,
against the property, as forfeited, for an alleged
breach of the revenue laws. His Catholic Majesty's
Vice Consul for the district of Rhode Island, interposed a claim on behalf of" certain subjects of the
King of Spain," the original owners of the ship and
cargo, which was bound on a voyage from the port
of Tarragona, in Spain, to La Vera Cruz, and was
taken off Cape St. Antonio, on the west end of the
island of Cuba, on the 21st of March, 1818, by an
armed vessel called the Puyerredon, commanded by
one. James Barnes, sailing under Buenos Ayres colours, and asserting a right to make.captures under
the authonty.of the government of that place. Resutution to the original Spanish owners was claimed,

upon the ground that the capturing vessel had been
i
equipped in the ports of this country, in violation of
Corrunes. our neutrality. An allegation was also filed by
Barnes, demanding restitution of the property to the
captors, as having been taken, jure belli, on the high
seas. Another claim was also filed by certain persons, part of the original crew of the Bello Corrunes,
left on board after the capture, who asserted a claim
for salvage, in case the property should be restored
to the original Spanish owners, under the following
circumstances. The master of the captured vessel,
and all her crew except four, were taken out, and a
prize master and crew put on board from the Puyerredon. Thus equipped, the Bello Corrunes cruised
in company with the Puyerredon nearly two months,
during which period another Spaniard, of the original crew of the Bello Corrunes, was returned to
that vessel. The two vessels afterwards separated,
and on the 8th of May, in lat. 320 30' north, and
longitude 740 W from London, the prize crew, assisted by the persons originally on board the Bello
Corrunes, rose on the prize masterand other officers,
and rescued the vessel from their possession. They
then steered their course for the United States, and
the vessel was by some means stranded upon .Block
Island, where the vessel and cargo were seized by
the revenue officers.
A decree was entered in the District Court, pro
forma, and by consent of parties, restoring the property to the original Spanish owners as claimed, and
dismissing the other allegations and claims. This
decree was affirmed, pro forma, and by consent, in

Mr. Winder, for the appellants and captors, insisted, that the present capture being made on the high
seas, jure bei,.under a commission regularly issued
by a Government acknowledged to be entitled to exercise the rights of war against its enemy, could not
be inquired into by the Courts of this country ; but
that the captors being entitled to the possession,
having only been dispossessed by the criminal misconduct of the prize crew which they had put on
board to secure the prize, were entitled to restitution,
in order to enable them to proceed against it as prize
in the competent Court. Whatever military means
are directed, from within the territory of one of ihe
belligerent States, against its enemy, are not subject
to the review or control of any neutral or other foreign tribunal or authority, except in the single case
of a direct violation of the neutral territory itself.
This principle grows out of the perfect independence
and equality of nations, existing as it were in a state
of nature in respect to each other. Their conduct
in authorizing acts of war is no more reviewable by
other nations, than any other their acts of sovereignty 4 It is this perfect independence and equality of
sovereign States which is the sole foundation of the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Prize Courts of the
captor's country over every thing done under a prize

withstanding the flagrantly unjust conduct of the
French Emperor in appropriating the property of an
American citizen to his own use, without the form of
a trial, and incorporating it into his military marine.
It must be shown, that the act of the Government of
Buenos Ayres in granting this commission is unlawful, before it can b& shown that any of the effects of
that act are invalid. Suppose the Exchange, on her
voyage, had made a -capture, could this Court have
restored it to the former owners ? Or could it inquire into the validity of such a capture consistently
with the principles laid down in that case P The
enlistment of men in neutral countries to serve the
belligerent powers is lawful, unless there be some express prohibition of the neutral State. Such a municipal prohibition would certainly make it unlawful,
in respect to the neutral State whose laws are violated ; but -it does not, therefore, follow, that all the
acts of guch persons in war would be unlawful, or
that they are not entitled to the rights of lawful

capture made with the munitions of war thus exported. The Government of this country naturalizes
all foreigners indiscriminately, in peace and m war,
and employs them in its land and naval service, and
it is not for us to question the right of a citizen of
the United States to enter into the military service
of a foreign State. It is insisted, that not only the
Court has no authority by the law of nations to restore to the original owners a prize thus captured,
but that the law of nations gives the Congress no
power to authorize the Court to restore. The Legislature may prohibit our citizens from enlisting in
the service of the belligerents, or from fitting out
ships to be employed in cruising, under ever so severe penalties, but those penalties cannot extend to
a forfeiture of the rights of prize acquired under the
commission of an independent sovereign State. Nor
are Spain and the United States competent to regulate by their mutual treaty stipulations the sovereign
rights of the South American Provinces, though
they may stipulate to inflict penalties rnpersonam,
for what they deem the criminal conduct of their
subjects or citizens. As to the claim of the United
States for a forfeiture on account of the alleged violation of the revenue laws, it is already settled by
this Court, that the property of foreigners cannot be
forfeited for the misconduct of those who are tortiously in possession, as was the case here with the
rescuers.4
a The Josefa Segunda, 5 Wheat. Rep. 338..

OF THE UNITED STATES.

Mr. Webster and Mr. Wheaton, for the respondent
and claimant, the Spanish Consul, (L.) contended,
that the Consul, from the necessity of the case, had

a right to interpose a claim for the property of his
.fellow subjects, brought into our ports in this manner. He does not claim as attorney in fact, but his
character is more lke an attorney at law. There is
no necessity of a special procuration from those for
whom he claims, because it does not follow, that the
property will be actually delivered into his hands
until the respective rights of the owners are determined, and a special authority produced from them
to receive distribution. There is the more necessity
for permitting the Consul, as the official protector of
the commercial rights and interests of his fellow subjects in a foreign country, to interpose a claim in
a case of this nature, because the usual term of a
year and a day allowed in prize causes, where there
is no claim, would not be allowed here, since the
property is demanded by the captors under their pretended commission, and if the subjects of Spain, residing at a distance, and ignorant even of the fact of
the capture, were not allowed to be represented by
their Consul, the property would be taken away by
the captors, and irrecoverably lost to the original
owners. It will also frequently be impossible for
the Consul to specify the owners for whom he claims,
and he ought, therefore, to be allowed to file allegations claiming it for Spanish subjects generally.

Danish Consulf proceeds entirely upon the peculiar

South American Provinces for employing foreigners

national vessel, like the Exchlange,a no doubt her

Spanish owners claim nothing against the Government of Buenos Ayres. That Government claims
nothing of the Spanish owners. Our own citizens
assert a claim to.this property acquired in war, which
can only be maintained upon the supposition, that
they may be at war whilst their country is at peace,
that they are not bound by the laws and treaties of

The Bello to the principle, that the neutral tribunals have a

violation of the laws of the neutral country. That
case has been made the basis of a series of decisions
which have become the settled law of this Court,
and which it is now too late to quettion. The
Court has uniformly treated it as a necessary consequence of the personal illegality 6f the act of taking

vessel was equipped. It is sufficient, that the capturing persons are citizens of the Unilted States, and
cannot asser a right of property founded on their
own illegal Londuct.
3. But even admitting that the original capture
was legal, the prize cannot now be reclaimed by the
captors. An interest acquired in war by possession,
is lost with the possession. The rights of capture
are completely devested by recapture, escape, or
rescue. Here the property has been devested out
of the possession of the captors by the rescuers, for
the 'benefit of the original owners, and the rescuers

Unless the property were thus restored to the Spanish owners, the rescuers could not claim any salvage; for certainly the captors would not admit that
any. meritorious service had been rendered them by
the rescue. But, as against the former owners, the
rescuers have a just claim, having saved the property
from the grasp of their enemy: and it would be idle
to send the salvors to the Courts of Spain, to prosecute their claim, since the possession of the property
enables this Court to do complete justice between
all the parties. And this Court has already determined, that in a case of derelict by one belligerent,
a neutral is entitled to salvage, -and the Courts of
the neutral country into which the property is
brought, have authority to award it.b As to the
quantum of salvage one third was allowed in that
case, and it was doubted whether more ought not to
have been allowed, if the salvors had appealed. The

complement of ihe privateer's men, about thirty in
number, and her original commander, and all except four of the Spanish crew, removed. Thus equipped, it appears that she cruised, as a tender to the

Thus circumstanced, Capt. Barnes has libelled in

behalf of the original Spanish owners, and the crew
of the Bello Corrunes have libelled for a compensation by way of salvage, to which they suppose themselves entitled, in the event of restitution being decreed to the original owners.
To these several claims it is objected on behalf of
the United States, that restitution cannot be decreed
to the Spanish Vice Consul, because he is not in-that
capacity a competent party in Court to assert the
rights of individual subjects , nor, in favour of the

object for which Consuls are deputed by their sovereigns, and in a country where laws govern, and

his own wrong ? We are of opinion he cannot, and
it therefore becomes material to determiie what, is
the national character of the claimants, under the
capture made by the Puyerredon.
At the time of this vessel's first sailing from Baltimore, she was unquestionably American owned
and commanded. During the time of her cruising

under the name of the Mangoree, it is not pretended
that she changed owners. The legality of her conduct at that period has been defended altogether on
the ground of her taking the flag of Buenos Ayres,
being commissioned in a foreign state, and.her commander, Barnes, assuming the character of a citizen of the power that had commissioned him. It is
not until her arrival at Buenos Ayres, in 1817, that
any change of property in the vessel has been set up
in proof. At that time, it is contended. she was set
up at auction, and changed owners, passing into the
hands of a Mr. Higginbotham, a citizen of the United
States, married and domiciled at Buenos Ayres.
If this fact had been satisfactorily made out in evidence, it would have drawn this Court into the consideration of some questions of great nicety, which
have never yet received a solemn adjudication in this
Court. But the evidence to support this pretended
change of property is so wholly unsatisfactory-, that
the Court rejects it, for, the ordinary solemnities of
such transfers are too well known, to admit the belief that in this instance, the change of property,
had it been real, would not have been effected or
commemorated by written documents.
This Court, then, proceeds upon the assumption
that the Puyerredon is still, in reality, American
owned, and they are also of opinion, that she must
be held to be American commanded, since, even if
the doctrine could be admitted, that a man's allegiance may be put off with his coat, it is very. clear
that Mi. Barnes' citizenship is altogether in fraud of

ced, the claim in behalf of the owners and mariners
of the Puyerredon, can be sustained.
We are decidedly of opinion it cannot.
By the 2d section of the 14th article of the treaty
with Spain, Citizens, subjects or inhabitants" of
the United States, are strictly prohibited from taking " any commission or letter of marque, for arming any ship or vessel, to act as privateers against
the subjects of his Catholic Majesty, or the property
of any of them, from any Prince or State with
which the said King shall be at war." And it is
further provided, " that if any person of either nation shall take such commissions'or letters of marque,,
he shall be punished as a pirate. '
Whatever difficulties there may exist under the
free institutions of this country, in giving full efficacy to the provisions of this treaty, by punishing
such aggressions as acts 6f piracy, it is not to be
questioned that they are prohibited acts, and intended to be stamped with the character of piracy,

been enforced by the provisions of the act of Congress of the 14th June, 1797, ยงo as to leave no
doubt of its extension to the case of cruising
against Spain, under a commission from the new
states formed in her colonies.
Citizens of the United States, therefore, present
themselves to this Court to demand restitution of a
prize which they had made in violation of the most
solemn stipulations of a treaty, and provisions of a
law of their own country, and of which they have
been dispossessed by their own associates in guilt.
Under such circumstances, this Court cannot hesitate to reject the claim, and adjudge the property to
the original proprietors.

and the merit of the alleged salvors. With regard
to the former, it is very clear, that supposing the

of the state -ofthe property, we are of opinion, that
the forfeiturelwas not incurred, since, although it
be supposed, that the property was in custody of
those who held for the Spanish owners, it was not
held by those to whom the Spanish owners had entrusted the vessel and cargo. And this is the only

shippers or ship owners. For, besides the considerations drawn from the great predominance of the
force detached from the privateer, in the effort to
recapture, the few- men of her own crew, were gratuitous actors. Their contract with the owners had
ceased, and they assumed the character of voluntary
agents, whose conduct the owners might or might
not adopt, according to their own views or interests.

from the pilot's evidence, that they run the vessel on

reality of their benevolent designs towards the Spanish owners originally, their subsequent conduct not
only casts a doubt over their candour, but devests
them of all pretensions to compensation.
Nor do the five Spaniards who composed a part
of the crew of the Bello Corrunes, at the time she
was stranded, and who were not of the capturing
crew, escape being involved in the suspicions which
fasten on their associates.
It is a melancholy truth, too well known to this
Court, that the instruments used in the predatory
voyages carried on under the colours of the South
American States, are among the most abandoned
and profligate of men. Under the influence of strong
interests or fears, the mind of man too often yields,
even where the moral sense still exerts its influence,

a course of plunder, the hope of gain on the one
hand, and the fear of imprisonment for piracy on the
