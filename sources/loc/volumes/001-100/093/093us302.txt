MARTIN V. HAZARD POWDER COMPAiY.
The doctrine announced in Jerome v. 31cCarter,21 Wall. 17, affirmed, and applied
to this case.

ON motion for a rule upon the plaintiff in error to file a new
supersedeas bond.
Mr.S. P. Phillivs for the defendant in error, - in support of
the motion.
.1r. ff. C. Alleman for the plaintiff in error, in opposition.
IR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAIE delivered the opinion of the
court.
We held in Jerome v. McCarter, 21 Wall. 17, after much
consideration, that if, "after the security has been accepted,
the circumstances of the case, or of the parties, or of the sureties upon the bond, have changed, so that security which, at
the time it was taken, was good and sufficient, does not continue
to be so, we might, upon a proper application, so adjudge and
order as justice might require. But upon facts existing at the
time the security was accepted, the action of the justice, within
the statute and the rules of practice adopted for his guidance,
is final."
The showing made in this case does not satisfy us that the
alleged insufficiency -of the security taken when the writ of
error was sued out, arises from any change in the circumstances
of the sureties since the acceptance and approval of the bond.
Motion denied.
