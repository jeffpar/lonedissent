appears that other evidence has been introduced tending to

show that the act of homicide was committed in self-defence,
and that the evidence of such threats may tend to confirm or
explain the other evidence introduced to establish that defence.

Society, in my opinion, is deeply interested that criminal
justice shall be accurately and firmly administered; and, being
unable to concur in the opinion and judgment of the court in
this case, I have deemed it propcr to state the reasons for my
dissent.

SMITH v. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE CO.IPANY ET AL.
1. Where the claim for a patent for an invention, which consists of a product or
a manufacture made in a defined manner, refers in terms to the antecedent
description in the specification of the process by which the product is obtained, such process is thereby made as much a part of the invention as are
the materials of which the product is composed.
2. Whether the single fact that a device has gone into general use, and displaced
other devices previously employed for analogous uses, establishes, in all
cases, that the later device involves a patentable invention, it may always
be considered as an element in the case, and, when the other facts leave
the question in doubt, it is sufficient to turn the scale.
8. Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 248, decides that employing one known
material in place of another is not invention, if the result be only greater
cheapness and durability of the product. It does not decide that the use of
one material in lieu of another in the formation of a manufacture can, in no
case, amount to invention, or be the subject of a patent.
4. In the present case, the result of the use, in the manner described in the specification, of hard rubber in lieu of the materials previously used for a plate
for holding artificial teeth, or such teeth and gums, is a superior product,
having capabilities and performing functions which differ from any thing
preceding it, and which cannot be ascribed to mere mechanical skill, but
are to be justly regarded as the results of inventive effort, as making the
manufacture of which they are attributes a novel thing in kind, and, consequently, patentable as such.
5. A patent is prima face evidence that the patentee- was the first inventor,
and casts upon him who denies it the burden of sustaining his denial by
proof.
6. The presumption arising from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents,
granting the reissue of letters-patent, that they are for the same invention
which was described in the specification of the original patent, can only be
overcome by clearly showing, from a comparison of tfie original specification with that of the reissue, that the former does not substantially describe
what is described and claimed in the latter.
7. Upon consideration of the history of this invention, the court holds: 1. That

Oct. 1876.]

SMITH v. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE

Co.

487

there was no abandonment by the patentee of his original application. 2. That
the application upon which the patent was finally allowed was a mere continuation of the original, and not a new and independent one. 3. That the
invention was never abandoned to the public. 4. That reissued letters-patent
No. 1904, dated March 21, 1865, for an alleged "improvement in artificial
gums and palates," are valid.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Massachusetts.
This was a bill in equity filed by the appellees against the
appellant for an infringement of reissued letters-patent No.
1904, for "improvement in artificial gums and palates," granted
March 21, 1865, to the appellees, as assignees of John A. Cummings. The bill prayed for an injunction, discovery, account,
and assessment of damages.
The original letters-patent No. 43,009, for said improvement,
were granted to said Cummings, and bear date June 7, 1864.
A decree was entered in favor of the complainants; whereupon the defendant appealed to this court, and assigns the following errors: First, The decree of the court below is erroneous, in adjudging that John A. Cummings was the original and first inventor
of the improvement described and claimed in the reissued letters-patent No. 1904, dated March 21, 1865.
Second, In adjudging that the reissued letters-patent No. 1904,
dated March 21, 1865, is a good and valid patent.
Third, In adjudging that the defendant had infringed the said
reissued letters-patent No. 1904, and upon the exclusive rights
of the complainants under the same.
Fourth, In awarding an account of profits and a perpetual
injunction against the defendant, according to the prayer of the
bill.
The history of the invention and the facts bearing upon the
questions involved are fully set forth in the opinion of the
court.
Mr. Henry Baldwin, Jr., for the appellant.
It is a well-settled and universally accepted rule of law, that
while a patent is prima facie evidence that the patentee was
the original and first inventor of what is therein described as
his improvement, such presumption in no case extends further
back than to the date of filing the original application. When-

488 "

S-MITH v. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE CO.

[Sup. Ct.

ever he intends to show that the invention was made prior to
that date, he must prove that he made it at the period suggested, and that lie reduced the same to practice in an
operative machine. Johnson v. Boot, 2 Fish. 297; White v.
Allen, 2 Cliff. 228; Wing v. Richardson, id. 450; 2 Fish. 444,
587.
The reissued letters-patent are void for want of patentable
novelty in the subject-matter. There is clearly nothing in this
case to avoid the rule so definitely settled in IHtclkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 264, 267, which has been reaffirmed in Tucker
v. Spaulding, 13 Wall. 453 ; Hicks v. Kelsey, 18 id. 670; Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. Howard, 20 id. 498; Smith v. Hichols,
21 id. 119; Roberts v. Ryer, 91 U. S. 159; Brown v. Piper,
id. 39, 41.
While the original patent described and claimed a mode of
making the plate and gums of rubber or other elastic material,
- a mode not only never practised, but impracticable,- the
reissue describes and claims a plate, or a plate and gums, made
by a method not indicated or suggested in the original patent,
and yet the only known method by which such a thing can be
made.
The reissue entirely discards the mode or process described
in the original patent. The product is not only the result of d
process radically different from that described in the patent,
but includes a substantially different element - gum, teethfrom that there suggested.
Even if it had been proved that Cummings's invention included the product and process described in the reissue, yet such
proof, aliunde the original record, would not warrant such a
change in the thing patented as is found'in this reissue. Sarven
v. Hall, 5 Fish. 419; CarTartv. Austin, 2 Cliff. 530, 536.
It is submitted that the reissue is void under the rule of
law, so definitely settled by this court, as to the effect of less
glarinig differences than are presented in this instance between the original and reissued patents. Gill v. Wells, 22.
Wall. 23, 24.
The appellant submits that the record proves that Cummings
absolutely withdrew his application of 1855 on the 17th of
January, 1859, when he applied for his papers, and that this

Oct. 1876.]

SMITH v. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE

Co.

489

withdrawal was consummated on the 20th of January, when the
office returned him the thin drawing.
It is impossible to connect his application of March 25, 1864,
with the former application, which, if not withdrawn, remained,
and still remains, in the Patent Office complete and susceptible
of prosecution; and if it had been prosecuted without reference
to the application of 1864, and a patent obtained upon it even
after the patent of 1864 was issued, the later patent would
have superseded the earlier one, because, though earlier in
issue, it was subsequent in date of application. Suffolk Co. v.
Hayden, 3 Wall. 315.
When, after eight years of entire inaction and acquiescence
in the third rejection by the office, Cummings again appeared
before the Patent Office, he did so with an entirely new case, petition, specification, drawings, and model, - and, without any
reference to his former application, paid the fee required by the
then existing law upon the new case.
His drawings in 1864 were different from those of 1855,
showing gum-teeth, and having four figures instead of three.
He could not have included these changes in a renewal of his
application of 1855, as the addition of subsequent improvements
was then prohibited by the statute. Act of 1861, sect. 9.
Nor does this case fall within the rule announced in Godfrey
v. Eames, 1 Wall. 217.
It is insisted that the inaction of Cummings and his acquiescence in the rejections of his original application amount to an
abandonment thereof; and that the alleged invention having
been in public use and on sale for more than two years prior to
his application for the letters of June 7, 1864, the reissue is
invalid.

MR. "JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.
A brief review of the history and nature of the patent which
the complainants allege has been infringed will aid materially
in solving the questions presented by this appeal. On the fourteenth day of Mar, 1852, Dr. John A. Cummings, a dentist of
Boston, filed in the Patent Office a caveat to protect an invention he claimed to have made, of certain new and useful im-

490

SMITH

v.

GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE CO.

[Sup. Ct.

provements in the setting and plates of artificial sets of teeth.
The description accompanying the caveat indicated with very
considerable clearness what the alleged invention was, and the
objects sought to be gained by it. The improvement was declared to "consist in forming the plate, and also the gums in
which the teeth are inserted, of rubber, or some other elastic
substance, so compounded with sulphur, lead, and other similar
substances as to form a hard gum, or whalebone gum, rigid
enough for the purposes of mastication, and pliable enough
to yield a little to the mouth." "By this improvement," the
6aveator said, "the teeth can be easily baked into the gums
which form one piece with the plate." Subsequently, on the
12th of April, 1855, he applied for a patent, reciting in his
application. that he had previously entered a caveat. His accompanying specification declared the invention to consist in
"forming the plate and gums to which the teeth are attached
of rubber, or some other elastic material, so indurated as to be
rigid enough for the purpose of mastication, and pliable enough
to yield a little to the motions of the mouth, and in one piece,
the teeth being embedded in the elastic material while the
material is in a soft condition, and then baked with the gums
and plate; so that the teeth, gums, and plate will all be connected,
forming, as it were, one piece." This application for a patent
was rejected on the 19th of May next following; and the applicant was referred to two printed publications, one suggesting
the use of gutta-percha as a base for artificial sets of teeth, and
the other suggesting pastes, analogous to porcelain paste, as well
ds gutta-percha. Cummings then amended his specification by
striking out all reference to gutta-percha or other merely elastic
material, disclaiming the use of gutta-percha, and any material
which is merely rendered plastic by heat and hardened by cooling, and he claimed the improvement in sets of mineral, or other
artificial sets of teeth which consists in combining the teeth with
a rubber plate and gums, which, after the insertion of the teeth,
are vulcanized by Goodyear's process, or any other process,
forming thereby a cheap, durable, and elastic substitute for the
gold plates theretofore used. This amendment, however, proved
ineffectual. The application for a patent was again rejected;
and a third rejection followed, a reconsideration for which the

Oct. 1876.]

SMITH V. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE

Co.

491

applicant had asked. This third rejection was on the third
day of February, 1856. From that time onward for several
years, indeed, until the patent was finally granted, the evidence very satisfactorily shows that Dr. Cummings was in a
condition of extrexme poverty, utterly unable to bear the necessary, expenses of prosecuting his case further. But he did
not withdraw his application. He did-not ask for a return
of part of the fee he had paid, nor by any act of his did he
indicate acquiescence in the unfavorable action of the Patent
Office. On the contrary, be continued to assert his expectation of ultimately obtaining a patent, formed plans for his
own action after it should be obtained, and complained of
what he supposed to be the negligence of his solicitor. The
proof of his extreme poverty is ample. His ill-health interfered with his working successfully in the line of his profession,
and his family was subjected- to great privations. He seems
never to have had any considerable money. He borrowed,
sometimes, small sums to purchase underclothing for himself.
He made frequent applications to his friends for advances to
enable him to prosecute his application for a patent, offering as
a compensation for such advances sometimes one quarter and
sometimes one half. of the patent when obtained. He appears
never to have remitted his efforts until, in 1864, he induced Dr.
Flagg, who had been his partner in former years, and Dr.
Osgood, to advance, first, $100, and afterwards $720, by means
of which the patent was obtained. Even then he had not the
$20 necessary to be paid when it was allowed. For the assistance he thus received he gave one quarter of his invention.
Before this time, between the third rejection of his application
and his obtaining the advances mentioned, every thing was done
which was within his power. In February, 1859, in the midst
of his pecuniary embarrassments, his, solicitor applied to the
Patent Office, not for a return of any portion of the fee paid,
nor for a withdrawal of the application, but that the specification and one drawing might be sent to him. This request was
refused. An attempt was then made for an appeal to the
board, but that not being allowed by the commissioner, nothing
further was done in the Patent Office until the applicant was
enabled, by the funds obtained from Drs. Flagg and Osgood, to

492

. SMITH v. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE CO.

[Sup. Ct.

renew his endeavors. Then, on the Ist of March, 1864, ht
presented a petition for the grant of a patent to himself for the
same-invention which he had endeavored to secure in 1855
(the application for which remained in the office unwithdrawn),
and accompanied his petition with a specification and drawings
corresponding exactly with those he had previously made.
This final effort was successful. The office practically aclnowledged that the prior rejection had been an error, and declared,
that, in justice to his rights as an inventor, the admission of his
claim, limited to the use of hard rubber or vulcanite, as he had
before limited it, would not be objected to. Accordingly the
patent was granted on the 7th of June, 1864, and by sundry
conveyances it subsequently became vested in the complainants.
Two surrenders and reissues have since been made, the last
dated March 21, 1865, and it is for an alleged infringement of
this second reissue that the present suit has been brought. The
bearing of this history upon the merits of the controversy will
appear as we proceed to examine the several defences set up.
Among these the one perhaps most earnestly urged is the
averment that the device described in the specification was not
a patentable invention, but that it was a mere substitution of
vulcanite for other materials, which had previously been employed as a base for artificial sets of teeth, - a change of one
material for another in the formation of a product. If this is
in truth all that the-thing described and patented was, if the
device was merely the employment of hard rubber for the same
use, in substantially the same manner and with the same effect
that other substances had been used for in the manufacture
of the same articles, it may be conceded that it constituted
no invention. So much is decided in Hotchkiss v. Greenwood,
11 How. 248. But such is not our understanding of the device
described and claimed. In the specification, it is declared that
the invention "consists in forming the plate to which the teeth,
or teeth and gums, are attached, of hard rubber, or vulcanite, so
called, an elastic material, possessing and retaining in use sufficient rigidity for the purpose of mastication, and at the same
time being pliable enough to yield a little to the motions of the
mouth." This is immediately followed by a description of the
manner of the proposed use; that is, of making the hard rub-

Oct. 1876.]

SMITH V. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE

Co.

493

ber plates: and the claim, as stated, is "the plate of hard
rubber, or vulcanite, or its equivalent, for holding artificial
teeth, or teeth and gums, substantially-as described;" that is,
plainly, formed as described. The invention, then, is a product
or manufacture made in a defined manner. It is not a product
alone separated from the process by which it is created. The
claim refers in terms to the antecedent description, without
which it cannot be understood. The process detailed is thereby
made as much a part of the invention as are the materials of
which the product is composed. We shall not quote at large
the description of the mode of making the plate. Such a
quotation would unnecessarily prolong this opinion. It plainly
shows a purpose of the inventor to secure what had not been
secured before, - a combination of a plate with artificial teeth,
or with gums and teeth, in such -a manner as to be free from
the objections and defects or inconveniences attending the
method before practised of attaching such teeth to a metallic
plate fitted to the roof of the mouth Some of these objections are stated; such as expense, hurting the mouth, impeding mastication, and obstruction to perfect articulation. In
carrying out the purpose proposed, the materials employed
were all old. The teeth, the wax, the plaster, the moulds, the
soft rubber, and the hard rubber, were none of them new. It
is also true that the steps in the process were not all new.
Plaster had been used for formation of moulds. The process of
forming a plate by the use of such moulds was wull known, and
so was the process of converting a vulcanizable compound into
vulcanite by heating it and allowing it to cool in moulds. But
the process of Dr. Cummings extended beyond the use of
known materials and the employment of the processes mentioned. It was vulcanizing soft rubber in a mould, and in contact with artificial teeth inserted in place into it while it
remained in a soft condition. It was well described by the
circuit judge as "the making of a vulcanite dental plate out of
a vulcanizable compound, into which the teeth were embedded
in its plastic condition, and the rubber compound, with the
teeth thus embedded in it, afterwards vulcanized by heat, so
that the teeth, gums, and plate should be perfectly joined without any intervening crevices, and the plate should possess the

494

SMITH v.GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE CO.

[Sup. Ct.

quality of hard rubber -or vulcanite." The combination thus
resulted in a manufacture which was " one piece." If, then,
the claim be read, as it should be, in connection with the preceding part of the specification, and construed in the light of
the explanation which that gives, the invention claimed and
patented is "a set of artificial teeth as a new article of manufacture, consisting of a plate of hard rubber, with teeth, or
teeth and gums, secured thereto in the manner described in
the specification, by embedding the teeth and pins in a vulcanizable compound, so that it shall surround them while it is in
a soft state, before it is vulcanized, and so that when it has
been vulcanized the teeth are firmly and inseparably secured
in the vulcanite, and a tight joint is effected between them, the
whole constituting but one piece." It is evident this is much
more than employing hard rubber to perform the functions that
had been performed by other, materials, such as gold, silver,
tin, platinum, or gutta-percha. A new product was the result,
differing from all that had preceded it, not merely in degree of
usefulness and excellence, but differing in kind, having new
uses and properties. It was capable of being perfectly fitted
to the roof and alveolar processes of the mouth. It was easy
for the wearer, and favorable for perfect articulation. It -was
light and elastic, yet sufficiently strong and firm for the purposes of mastication. The teeth, gums, and plate constituting
one piece only, there were no crevices between the teeth and
their supporters into which food could gather, and where it
could become offensive, and there could be nosuch crevices so
long as the articles lasted. They were unaffected by any
chemical action of the fluids of the mouth. Besides all this,
they were very inexpensive as compared with other arrangements of artificial teeth. To us it seems not too much to say
that all these peculiarities axe sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the device was different in kind or-species from all
other devices. We cannot resist the conviction that devising
and forming such a manufacture by such a process and of such
materials was invention. More was needed for it than simply
mechanical judgment and good taste. Were it not so, hard
rubber would doubtless have been used in the construction of
artificial sets of teeth, gums, and plates long before Cummings

Oct. 1876.]

SmTH v. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE Co.

495

applied for his patent. To find a material, with a mode of
using it, capable of being combined with the teeth in such a
manner as to be free from the admitted faults of all other
known combinations, had been an object long and earnestly
sought. It had been a subject for frequent discussion among
dentists and in scientific journals. The properties of vulcanite
were well known; but how to make use of them for artificial
sets of teeth remained undiscovered, and apparently undiscovable, until Cummings revealed the mode. But when revealed
its value was soon recognized, and no one seems to have
doubted that the resulting manufacture was a new and most
valuable invention. The eminent dentists and experts examined in this case uniformly speak of it as such.. Not one has
ventured- to testify that it was not an invention. They speak
of it as "a novel and desirable thing;" as "the greatest
improvement in dentistry" made in many years; and as an
invention which is " a great benefaction to mankind, whereby
The evidence also
both health and comfort are promoted."
shows that it has wrought a revolution in dental practice, and
that many thousands of operators are using it in preference to
older devices. All this is sufficient, we think, to justify the
inference that what Cummings accomplished was more than .a
substitution of one material for another; more than the exercise
of mechanical judgment and taste, - that it was, in truth, invention. Undoubtedly, the results or consequences of a process or
manufacture may in some cases be regarded as of importance
when the inquiry is, whether the process or manufacture exhibits invention, thought, and ingenuity. Webster, on the subject-matter of patents, page 30, says: "The utility of the
change, as ascertained by its consequences, is the real practical
test of the sufficiency/of an invention; and since the one cannot
exist without the other, the existence of the one may be presumed on proof of the existence of the other. Where the
utility is proved to exist in any degree, a sufficiency of invention to support the patent must be presumed." We do not say
the single fact that a device has gone into general use, and has
displaced other devices which had previously been employed
for analogous uses, establishes in all cases that the later device
involves a patentable invention. It may, however, always be

496

SMITH v. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE

O.

[Sup.

Ct.

considered; and, when the other facts in the case leave the
question in doubt, it is sufficient to turn the scale.
We have, therefore, considered this branch of the case without particular reference to Hotehkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How.
248. The patent in that case was for an improvement in making door and other knobs for doors, locks, and furniture, and
the improvement consisted in making them of clay or porcelain, in the same manner in which knobs of iron, brass, wood,
or glass had been previously made. Neither the clay knob nor
the described method of attaching it to the shank was novel.
The improvement, therefore, was nothing more than the substitution of one material for another in constructing an article.
The clay or porcelain door-knob had no properties or functions
which other door-knobs made of different materials had not. It
was cheaper, and perhaps more durable; but it could be applied
to no new use, and it remedied no defects which existed in
other knobs. Hence it was ruled that the alleged improvement
was not a patentable invention. The case does decide that
employing one known material in place of another is not invention, if the result be only greater cheapness and durability of
the product. But this is all. It does not decide that no use
of one material in lieu of another in the formation of a manufacture can, in any case, amount to invention, or be the subject
of a patent. If such a substitution involves a new mode of
construction, or develops new uses and properties of the article
formed, it may amount to invention. The substitution may be
something more than formal. It may require contrivance, in
which case the mode of making it would be patentable; or the
result may be the production of an analogous but substantially
different manufacture. This was intimated very clearly in the
case of Hicks v. Kelsey, 18 Wall. 670, where it was said, " The
use of one material instead of another in constructing a known
machine is, in most cases, so obviously a matter of mere mechanical judgment, and not of invention, that it cannot be
called an invention, unless some new and useful result, as
increase of efficiency, or a decided saving in the operation, be
obtained."
But where there is some such new and useful
result, where a machine has acquired new functions anil useful properties, it may be patentable as an invention, though

Oct. 1876.]

SMITH V. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE Co.

497

the only change made in the machine has been supplanting one
of its materials by another. This is true of all combinations,
whether they be of materials or processes. In Crane v. Price,
1 Webst. Pat. Cas. 393, where the whole invention consisted in
the substitution of anthracite for bituminous coal in combination with a hot-air blast for smelting iron ore, a patent for it
was sustained. The doctrine asserted was, that if the result of
the substitution was a new, a better, or a cheaper article, the
introduction of the substituted material into an old process was
patentable as an invention. This case has been doubted, but
it has not been overruled; and the doubts have arisen from the
uncertainty whether any new result was obtained by the use of
anthracite. In Kneass v. Schuylkill Bank, the use of steel plates
instead of copper for engraiing was held patentable. So has
been the flame of gas instead of the flame of oil to finish cloth.
These cases rest on the fact that a superior product has been
the result of the substitution, - a product that has new capabilities and that performs new functions. So in the present case the
use, in the manner described, of hard rubber in lieu of the materials previously used for a plate produced a manufacture long
sought but never before obtained, - a set of artificial teeth,
light and elastic, easily adapted to the contour of the mouth,
flexible, yet firm and strong, consisting of one piece, with no
crevices between the teeth and the plate, impervious to the
fluids of the mouth, unaffected by the chemical action to which
artificial teethi and plates are subjected when in place, clean
and healthy, - peculiarities which distinguish it from every
thing that had preceded it. These differences, in our opinion,
are too many and too great to be ascribed to mere mechanical
*skill. They may justly be regarded as the results of inventive
effort, and as making the manufacture of which they are attributes a novel thing in kind, and consequently patentable as
such.
A second objection urged by the defendant against the
validity of the complainant's patent is alleged want of novelty
of the invention; and a strenuous effort has been made to
convince us, that, although hard rubber had not been used in
the mannet described for the prodution of the manufacture,
equivalent materials and processes had been, and that a plate

[Sup. Ct.

substantially the same as that of Dr. Cummings had been made
before his improvement. We are not, however, convinced.
'The patent itself is prima facie evidence that the patentee was
the first inventor, at least it casts upon him who denies it the
burden of sustaining his denial by proof. We do not find such
proof in the case. Though the patent was not granted until
June 7, 1864, the invention was completed at least as early as
April 12, 1855, 'vhen the application for a patent was made.
Indeed, as we'have noticed, a caveat to protect it was filed on
the 14th of May, 1852, which clearly foreshadowed the invention. Yet taking the spring of 1855 as the time when it was
completed, We find nothing in the proofs to justify a conclusion
that Dr. Cummings was not the first inventor. It would answer
no gobd purpose to review the voluminous evidence supposed
to bea,' upon this branch of the case. We shall refer only to
that which is deemed most important, and which has been most
pressed upon us in this argument. Of the English patent of
Charles Goodyear it is enough to say, that, though the provisional specification was filed March 14, 1855, the completgd
specification was not until the 11th of September following. It
was, therefore, on the last-mentiondd date that the invention
was patented.
The experiments made by George E. Iawes, it must be
admitted, closely resembled the process described in the reissued
patent to the complainants. He cast in moulds sets of teeth on
a tin base, in a manner very like that in which the vulcanite
plate is formed by the Cummings process. But the experiments
resulted in nothing practical. Hawes cast sets of teeth for the
lower jaw only, the weight of the metal making the plate unfit
for the upper. In consequence of the shrinkage of the metal
in cooling, a tight joint could not be obtained between the
teeth and the base. The sets were, therefore, liable to become
offensive in consequence of deposits of food- and the secretions
of the mouth in the crevices. The shrinkage also prevented a
close fitting of the plate to the roof of the mouth, and the tin
base was affected by the chemical action of the secretions. In
consequence of these and other objections the manufacture was
soon abandoned,and it may properly be considered an abandoned
experiment. It not only was not the same manufacture as, that

Oct. 1876.]

SMITH V. GOODYEAR DENTAL VULCANITE

Co.

499

of Cummings, but it was not suggestive of it; and Dr. Hawes,
who cast the tin plates, testifies that the use of vulcanite for
dental purposes is the greatest improvement in his profession
that be knew of in twenty-five years. He adds, " that vulcanite
may be used by dentists in many ways which could not be
accomplished by tin or platinum." In his opinion, therefore,
the cast-tin base was not substantially the same thing as the
Cummings manufacture. So, also, Dr. Royce, who cast plates
of tin for artificial teeth in a manner very similar to that of
Dr. Hawes, testifies that the solid tin base was found practically
unfit for the purpose, except in rare instances. He made but a
few sets, none after 1850, and adopted the vulcanite, agreeing
to pay for a license to use it in manufacturing dental plates.
We need go no farther into a consideration of the various
-devices and publications offered to show that the manufacture
patented was known before Cummings invented it. Suffice it
to say, that none of them, in our opinion, suggest or exhibit in
substance such a manufacture. The defence of want of novelty
is, therefore, not sustained.
It is further insisted by the defendant .that the reissued
patent on which this suit is founded is not a patent for the
same invention which was described in the specification of the
original patent, and, therefore, that the reissue is unauthorized
and void. To sustain this position the defendant must overcome
the presumption against him arising from the decision of the
Commissioner of Patents in granting the issue; and this he can
do only by showing, from a comparison of the original specification with that of the reissue, that the former does not substantially describe what is described and claimed in the latter.
This must plainly appear before we can be justified in pronouncing the reissued patent void. But this, in our judgment,
does not appear. The first specification 'describes a set of
artificial teeth having a hard-rubber plate made by a process
substantially the same as that indicated in the later patent.
The description of the process is not quite so minute; but it is
sufficiently full to be understood, and to enable an operator to
make the manufacture. Certainly it is not another process;
and as its result is the same, it is impossible to hold that the
reissued patent is for a different invention from the one protected

[Sup. Ct.

by the original patent. It is true, the specification of the reissue
describes also another process not described in the specification
of the first, - namely, a mode of making the moulds, - but that
is not claimed as a part of the invention.
The remaining defences to the bill rest mainly on the assumption that the new petition presented to the Patent Office in
1864 cannot be regarded as a continuation of the application
made for a patent on the 12th of April, 1855. But this cannot
be conceded. The history of the application, as we have given
it, forbids such an assumption. No act of Cummings amounted
to a withdrawal of his first petition, or to an acquiescence in its
rejection.. It is true, he filed a second petition in 1864; but he
accompanied it with substantially the specification that remained
in the office, and with the same drawings. It was a mode of
procuring another consideration of his rejected claim; and the
commissioner regarded it as such. The act of March 2 1861,
gave him authority thus to regard it. He replied to the application, that his claim was embraced in an application filed by
him in 1855, and rejected for want of novelty, admitted that it
had been improperly rejected, and suggested an amendment to
make it correspond with his former amended claim. -It is
impossible, in view of these facts, to regard the effort to obtain
a new patent in 1864 as a new and independent application,
disconnected from the application made in 1855. It was but
one stage in a continuous effort. In Godfrey v. Eames, 1 Wall.
317, the first application was actually withdrawn, and a new
petition was presented at the time of the withdrawal, with a
different description of the invention; but as the thing patented
under the second might have been engrafted as an amendment,
of the first, it was ruled that all the proceedings constituted
'one application. This court said, " If a party choose to withdraw his application for a patent, and pay the forfeit, intending
at the time of such withdrawal to file a new petition, and he
accordingly does so, the two.petitions are to be considered parts
of the same transaction, and both as constituting one continuous
application." We Ere not aware that filing a second petition
for a patent, after the first has been rejected, has ever been
regarded as severing the second application from the first and
depriving the applicant of 4ny advantage he would have enjoyed

had the patent been granted without a renewal of the application. The contrary was decided by the Circuit Court for the
Southern District of Ohio, in Bell v. Daniels, 1 Fish. 372, and
in Blandy v. Griffith et al., 3 id. 609; and these decisions
are founded in justice and sound reason.
If, then, as we think it must be held, the proceeding to obtain
the patent was a continuous one from 1855 until it was granted;
if the application of 1855 is not severable from the proceedings
of 1864, - there is no foundation whatever for the allegation
that the invention was abandoned to the public, and that it was
in public use or on sale for more than two years before the
hiventor's application. The first use of it proved, by any other
than Dr. Cummings, was in 1859; and there is no evidence that
this was with his consent. And the proof respecting his health
and pecuniary condition, together with his constant efforts to
obtain the necessary means to prosecute his right, rebuts all
presumption that he ever abandoned, actually or constructively,
either his invention or his application for a patent. That he
never intended an abandonment of his invention is perfectly
clear; and it was not his fault that granting the patent was so
long delayed.
The conclusion of the whole matter is, that the patent is a
valid one; and, therefore, that the decree of the Circuit Court
should be affirmed.
Decree affirmed.
whom concurred Mn. JUSTICE
and MR. JUSTICE FIELD, dissenting.
I dissent from the judgment 6f the court in this case, on the
ground that the patentee, having duly made his application for
a patent in 1855, and the same having been three times rejected,
must be considered as having abandoned the same, inasmuch as
no further effort was made to obtain a patent until eight years
afterwards, without any pretence that the patentee was engaged
in perfecting his invention, and in the mean time the invention
which he claims as his had come into general public use. The
application for a patent made in 1864 was a new and independent
application, and should be treated as such. As the public had
enjoyed the use of the invention for more than two years prior
to this application, the patent should be declared invalid.

Great injustice will, in my judgment, be done to the public to
allow a patent obtained under such circumstances to stand.
The public had a right to suppose that no further application
'would be made. The levy'of a tribute now on all the dentists
of the country who have brought the plate into public notice
and use seems to me a species of injustice. The delay of the
patentee, in fact,-is made to operate to his benefit instead of his
prejudice, his patent being made td run eight years longer
than it would' have done had it been granted when first applied
for; so that the public is still further injured by sustaining
the patent as finally granted. It is too common a case that
associated companies, in order to maintain some valuable monopoly, look about to see what abandoned invention or rejected
application, or ineffective patent, can be picked up, revamped,
and carried through the Patent Office, and by the aid of
ingenious experts and skilful counsel succeed in getting the
desired protection. I think that the cQurts ought to be strict in
maintaining the rights of the public in such cases. And the
present case seems to me to be one in which we ought to hold
the patent invalid as against those rights.

act of the general assembly of the State of Illinois, approved Nov. 6, 1849,
authorizing counties to subscribe to the capital stock of railroad companies,
because i s charter vests it with power to carry on, in addition to the business of such a company, that of a coal, or a mining, or a furnace, or a

to its interests, or, like other parties to a contract, estop itself.
