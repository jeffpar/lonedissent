[Sup. Ct.

tory proceeding begun in the Probate Court of Salt Lake
County, Utah, to settle disputes between claimants as to their
respective rights to a lot in Salt Lake City, purchased by the
mayor of the city from the United States, in trust, under the
Town-Site Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 541. As doubts were
entertained in respect to the proper manner of bringing it here
for review, an appeal was taken and a writ of error sued out.
For the reasons stated in that case, the appeal is sustained and
the writ of error dismissed.
The controversy arises as to the ownership of the south half
of lot 5, block 76, plat A, and the first question to be settled
is in respect to the jurisdiction of the District Court on the
appeal from the Probate Court. The decision of the Probate
Court was given Nov. 28, 1873, and the appeal taken Feb. 3,
1874. The territorial act of 1869, regulating the execution
of town-site trusts (Comp. Laws Utah (1876), 381), provides
that if either party shall feel aggrieved at the decision of the
Probate Court, he may appeal to the District Court "as in
other cases." In Colding v. Jennings (1 Utah, 135), it was
decided that there could be no appeal from the Probate Court
to the District Court in a civil action, because the Probate
Court did not have jurisdiction of such actions. Here the
Probate Court had jurisdiction of the suit, and the right of
appeal is expressly given. The difficulty is not as to the right
of appeal, but as to the time within which the appeal is to be
taken. The Civil Practice Act of Utah (Comp. Laws (1876),
492) provides that an appeal may be taken "from a final judgment in an action or special proceedings commenced in the
court in which the judgment is rendered, within one year from
the rendition of the judgment," and " from a judgment rendered on an appeal from an inferior court, within ninety days
after the rendition of the judgment." This, we think, governs
the present case. The provision in the territorial act relating
to the judiciary, approved Jan. 19, 1855, fixing the time for
appeals from the probate to the district courts at thirty days,
is in conflict with the Civil Practice Act in this particular, and
comes within the repealing clause of the latter act.
Upon the appeal from the Probate Court to the District
Court, "all the testimony and written proofs adduced, to-

gether with the statements of the parties and the judgment
of the court," were certified up as required by the territorial
town-site law. Upon the trial, the District Court decided that
the execution of a deed from Orson Pratt to Brigham Young,
which was sent up as part of the written proofs below, had
not been sufficiently shown. For this reason the deed was
excluded as evidence. The District Court also excluded as
evidence the answers of Brigham Young, Jr., to two interrogatories which had been propounded to him, and also the
answers of Hamilton G. Park to interrogatories propounded
to him. The same thing was done in respect to the answers
of Brigham Young, Sen., to five interrogatories. The excluded
testimony of Brigham Young, Jr., related to the payment of
rent for the premises in dispute to him as agent for his father,
Brigham Young, Sen., "after the claim of Mrs. Pratt, the appellee, had been filed with the clerk of the Probate Court.
The testimony of Park related to payment of rent for the lot
by one Ellerbach, as agent of Orson Pratt, to him as the agent
of Brigham Young, Sen., from the fall of 1867 to the spring of
1869. The testimony of Brigham Young, Sen., related to his
purchase of the lot from Orson Pratt in 1861 or 1862, and he
also said that he was the owner of the lot with two tenants on
it. Objections to all the testimony which was excluded had
been taken and entered upon the minutes in the Probate
Court.
Upon the trial in the District Court the facts were found,
and as a conclusion of law judgment was given in favor of
Mrs. Pratt. Brigham Young, Sen., the adverse claimant,
moved for a new trial, because the findings were against the
evidence. This motion was overruled, and he thereupon appealed to the territorial Supreme Court both from the judgment and the order refusing a new trial. A statement of the
case was made on these appeals, which included all the testimony with the exceptions and the entire record of the proceedings in the District Court. The Supreme Court affirmed
generally the judgment of the District Court.
As we held in Stringfellow v. Cain, when the Supreme
Court affirms the judgment of the District Court upon findings of fact made by the District Court, the Supreme Court

CANNON V. PRATT.

[Sup. Or.

in effect adopts such findings as its own for the purposes of
an appeal to this court. We are therefore to consider the case
here upon the facts found by the District Court. These findings show that Sarah M. Pratt, the present claimant and
appellee, and Orson Pratt, settled on the lot in controversy
about the year 1854. Mrs. Pratt erected a house and fences
upon the lot, and the two lived there until 1861, when they
went to the southern part of the Territory. After that for
several years Brigham Young, Sen., had possession of the lot
by his tenants, but in 1867 or early in 1868 he told Mrs. Pratt
she might have back the south: half, and accordingly she and
her family went into possession on the 12th of March, 1868,
and have occupied it as their home ever since. Orson Pratt
has not lived with his wife, Sarah M. Pratt, since iMarch 12,
1868, and he has five other families, four of which are residents
of Salt Lake City. Mrs. Pratt and her children have supported themselves by their labor and means since March 12,
1868, and have put improvements on the lot by repairing the
house, fencing, setting out trees, &c. Mrs. Pratt was the
head of her family for ten years previous to November, 1873.
No rent has been claimed of or paid by her since she went
into possession, nor by Orson Pratt or any agent of his since
that time. Orson Pratt has not supported his wife, Sarah11A.
Pratt, or her family since larch, 1868, and has contributed
bnt a very small amount for that purpose. The town site was
purchased by the mayor, under the provisions of the Congressional Town-Site Act, Nov. 21, 1871. Young filed his declaratory statement in the office of the probate clerk, Jan. 13, 1872,
and Mrs. Pratt filed hers April 9, 1872.
Upon this state of facts it is clear that the judgment appealed from was right, unless there was error in the rulings as
to the admissibility of evidence. The original occupancy of
Orson Pratt and his wife was abandoned in 1861. Brigham
Young then entered into possession. It matters not, for the
purposes of this inquiry, whether he purchased the possessory
rights of Pratt and his wife or not. They voluntarily left the
lot and he took it. Then in 1868 he gave back the south half
to Mrs Pratt, and she has occupied adversely ever since.
Under the rule settled in Stringfellow v. Cain, this gave her

v. PRATT.

the right to a conveyance under the trust created by the townsite purchase.
It remains only to consider the several objections to the
rulings upon the admissibility of the evidence. From what
has been said it is clear that the exclusion of the deed was
immaterial. As Pratt and his wife abandoned the possession
in 1861, it is of no consequence whether Young occupied after
that as their vendee or as an adverse possessor. He was in
possession claiming title, and they were out with no apparent
purpose of returning. That is all that is necessary to make
his right good as against their previous entry.
As to the testimony of Brigham Young, Jr., it related
to a payment of rent by Orson Pratt after this proceeding
was begun in the Probate Court. Of course that, under the
circumstances, could have no effect adverse to Mrs. Pratt's
title.
As to the testimony of Brigham Young, Sen., it was clearly
immaterial or incompetent. That in respect to his purchase
from Pratt was immaterial, because his rights prior to his
putting Mrs. Pratt in possession the second time are not disputed. His statement that he owned the property was incompetent. That depended upon the facts, and his statement was
no more than an expression of his opinion.
The testimony of Park, so far as it related to the ownership
of the property, was also incompetent, as it was in reality only
an expression of his opinion. As to the collection of rent
from Orson Pratt, he says his collections were made from
T. W. Ellerbach, as the agent of Pratt, and in the testimony
of Ellerbach the same payments are shown, with the manner
of payment and his authority as agent. No possible harm
could have resulted from the exclusion of this evidence. A
judgment will not be reversed for error in excluding testimony
which is cumulative only, if it is apparent that if received it
would not affect the result. In this case the rejected evidence
was all before the Supreme Court, and was there considered.
In the opinion it is in effect said that if the evidence had been
admitted in the court below, and if that court had given it all
the force which could be reasonably claimed, the result must
have been the same. Under these circumstances we must con-
