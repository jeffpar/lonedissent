Oct. 1878.]

ALVORD v. UNITED STATES.

MR. JUSTICE SWAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.

The determination of this case is controlled by Brown et al.
v. Piper, 91 U. S. 37. We cannot fail to take judicial notice
that the thing patented was known and in general use long
before the issuing of the patent. The substitution of metal for
wood was destitute both of patentable invention and utility.
The admission of improper testimony, if it occurred, was, therefore, immaterial. The case of the appellant as it appears in
the record, without any testimony, is clear and conclusive
against him.
-Decreeaffirmed.

ALVORD v. UNWITED STATES.
1. The court announces its determination to enforce rigidly the rules requiring
causes to be ready for hearing when they are reached.
2. Counsel who enter their appearance under the requirements of Rule 9 will be
held responsible for all that such an entry implies, until, by substitution or
otherwise, they are relieved from the obligation they have assumed.

Mr. J. IV. -Denverin support of the motion.
MR. CBIEF JUSTICE WAITE announced the judgment of
the court.
This application comes directly within the rule laid down in
Hurley v. Jones, 97 U. S. 318.. As we took occasion to say in
that case, "our rules requiring causes to be ready for hearing
when reached are and will continue to be rigidly enforced."
We recognize no pro forma attorneys of record. Counsel who
enter their appearance under the requirements of Rule 9 must
understand that the court will hold them responsible for all
that such an entry implies until they relieve themselves from
the obligation they assume, by substitution or otherwise.
Motion denied,
