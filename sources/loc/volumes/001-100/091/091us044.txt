PIPER V. MOON ET AL.

[Sup. Ct,

concentric apartments, - an inner one, containing the article to be
frozen ; one eccentric to this, containing the freezing mixture, pro
vided with some contrivance for agitation ; one, again, outside of
this, filled with a non-conductor of heat, as powdered charcoal,
gypsum, or cotton wool; and sometimes one between them for
holding water." Tit. "Freezing," 7 Amer. Encyclo. 474.
Here the principle and substance of the appellee's claim are
set forth as belonging to the general domain of knowledge and
science. It is known that Lord Bacon applied snow to poultry
to preserve it. He said the process succeeded "excellently
well." The experiment was made in his old age, imprudently,
and brought on his last illness.
Examined by the light of these considerations, we think this
patent was void on its face, and that the court might have
stopped short at that instrument, and without looking beyond
it into the answers and testimony, sua sponte, if the objection
were not taken by counsel, well have adjudged in favor of the
defendant.
These views render it unnecessary to consider the exceptions
to the master's report.
The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed; and the cause will
be remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill.

P=RE

v. MooN ET AL.

MR. JUSTIoE SwA=u delivered the opinion of the court.
The appellant's bill in this case is founded upon the same
patent as the bill of the appellee in Brown et al. v. Piper,
above reported.
In this case the court below dismissed the bill, and the complainant appealed to this court. What was said in the case
referred to disposes of this.
The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.
