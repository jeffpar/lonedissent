.STATE OF lLORIDA V.

ANDERSOX ET AL.

Certain railroad companies, availing themselves of the provisions of an act of the

legislature of Florida of Jan. 10, 1855, to provide for and encourage a liberal
system of internal improvements in that State, issued their bonds to the extent
of $10,000 per mile, the interest whereon was duly guaranteed by the trustees
of the internal-improvement fund created by the act. Such bonds thereby
became a first lien or mortgage on the roads, their equipments, and the franchises, of the respective companies. The latter having failed to pay the in-

terest on the bonds, or the instalments due the sinking fund for their ultimate
redemption, the roads were seized by the trustees, pursuant to their authority
under the act, and sold for an amount equal to the principal of the bonds.
The purchasers being allowed the privilege of paying the purchase-money by
delivering the bonds at their par value, nearly a million dollars of them were

38

[Sup. Ct.

thus surrendered and cancelled; but a balance of about $472,000 remained
unpaid. The purchasers obtained, however, a deed for, and took possession
of, the property, being a line of road from Lake City to Quincy, with a branch
from Tallahassee to St. Mark's, and procured a new charter from the legislature, under the name of "The Tallahassee Railroad Company." Having
subsequently consolidated their interests with the Florida Central Railroad
Company, owning the road from Lake City eastward to Jacksonville, they
procured another charter, with enlarged powers, creating a corporation by the
name of "The Jacksonville, Pensacola, and 'Mobile Railroad Company."
This last act of incorporation authorized the company to acquire and consolidate certain lines of road, and extend the same from Quincy westward to the
western boundary of the State; and, with a view to aid the company in the
completion of this work, the act, as subsequently amended by the legislature,
authorized the governor to loan the company bonds of the State, to an amount
equal to $16,000 per mile, in exchange for an equal amount of the first-mortgage
bonds of the company. In order to secure the principal and interest of the
company's bonds, it was declared "that the State of Florida shall, by this
act, have a statutory lien, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as
a first mortgage duly registered on the part of the road for which said bonds
were delivered, and on all the property of the company, real and personal,
appertaining to that part of the line which it may now have, or may hereafter
acquire, together with all the rights, franchises, and powers thereto belonging;
and in case of failure by the company to pay either principal or interest of
its bonds, or any part thereof, for twelve months after the same shall become
due, it shall be lawful for the governor to enter upon and take possession of
said property and franchises, and sell the same at public auction." Under
this power, bonds of the State to the amount of $4,000,000 were delivered to
the company. The balance of the purchase-money due on the trustees' sale
remaining unpaid, and the Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Mobile Railroad Company having also failed to pay the interest on their bonds delivered to the
State in exchange for those of the State aforesaid, the State and the trustees
of the improvement fund commenced suit in a circuit court of the State to
recover by a sale of the road the balance of such purchase-money, which was
claimed to be a lien thereon. All then known parties having liens against
the road were made defendants. Suit was also brought against the company,
in another circuit, by certain first-mortgage bondholders. The Circuit Court
of the United States for the Northern District of Florida also entertained, at
the instance of certain other bondholders, a suit in equity against the company
and the trustees; but the bill, as against the latter, was dismissed by the complainants. Under an arrangement between the complainants and the company,
a consent decree was obtained, declaring the bonds a first lien on the road, and
directing its sale to pay the same. Subsequently to the issue of tle execution
a bill was filed to carry the decree into execution, making the trustees of the
internal-improvement fund defendants, and charging them with intent to seize
the road, and praying for an injunction. Meanwhile suit was commenced in
the same court against the company by one H. for services alleged to have
been rendered it. Judgment was recovered accordingly for $60,000; and, at
the sale of the road thereunder, he became the purchaser for $20,000, and entered into possession. Under these circumstances, tle State of Florida filed
the bill in this suit.

STATE OF FLORIDA V. ANDERSON ET AL.

669

Held, First,That the State has a direct interest in the railroad by reason
of holding the .94,000,000 of bonds, which were a statutory lien on the road.
That, as the title to the lands composing the internal-improvement fund was
vested in the trustees merely as the agents of the State for a particular purpose, her interest is sufficient to give her a standing in court whenever the
interests of that fund are brought before a court for inquiry. It is competent
for her, therefore,.in seeking equitable relief against citizens of another State
for the protection of her interests, to file an original bill in this court.
Second, That the equitable lien for the unpaid purchase-money accruing
upon the sale by the trustees resulted primarily to them as vendors, and became binding on the road in the hands of all subsequent purchasers taking
with notice of the non-payment.
Third, That, as the guaranteed bonds import on their face an absolute
promise to pay, the company giving them is primarily liable to the bolder
thereof for principal and interest as they respectively become due; and while
lie can, upon a breach of such promise, bring suit against the company, he
cannot, aÂ§ the primary right to proceed under the statutory lien is in the trustees, avail himself of that lien directly, as he could if it were a mortgage given
to secure the bonds alone, but must induce the trustees to act in the mode
pointed out by the statute. Upon their refusal so to act at the proper time,
he may either compel them by mandamus, or file a bill in equity to obtain the
relief to which lie may be entitled.
Fourth, Where a sale is made by thetrustees for the non-payment of interest or instalments due the sinking fund, and the principal of the bonds is not
due, they have an option, after satisfying the arrears of interest, either to
purchase up and retire th3 bonds, or to pay the balance into the sinking fund,
and postpone the payment of the principal until the bonds arrive at maturity.
By the purchase of a portion of the bonds, an obligation to purchase the
remainder is not imposed upon the trustees, nor are they precluded from
changing a resolution so to purchase.
FfIh, Holders of bonds so guaranteed, by procuring with the consent of the
company a decree for the sale of the road to pay the interest, and especially
the principal thereof, when the bonds contain no stipulation that the principal shall become due by the non-payment of interest, in a proceeding in which
neither the State nor the trustees were represented, and when the latter were
pursuing their lawful remedy to subject the road to the payment of the purchase-money at a sale made by them, was an inequitable interference with,
and a fraud upon, their rights.

THIs is an original suit in equity instituted in this court.
It was argued by iJir. H. Bisbee, Jr., for the complainant;
and by Abr. Henry B?. Jackson, JMr. Hatt. H. Carpenter, and
31r. William T. Boyce, for the defendants.
MR. JUsTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill in equity filed by the State of Florida (by its
attorney-general), on behalf of the said State and of the trustees of the internal-improvement fund of the State, against

6T0

STATE OF FLORIDA V. ANDERSON ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

Daniel P. Holland and Edward C. Anderson and others, citizens of Georgia. Sherman Conant, the Marshal of the United
States for the Northern District of Florida, is made a formal
defendant by reason of having in his hands an execution at the
suit of some of the other defendants.
The subject-matter of the suit is a line of railroad in Florida
extending from Jacksonville westwardly to Quincy about one
hundred and ninety miles, with a branch from Tallahassee to
St. Mark's of twenty-one miles. It consists of three divisions,
originally built and owned by different companies. The first
division, from Jacksonville to Lake City, was built and
owned by the Florida, Atlantic, and Gulf Central Railroad
Company; the second, from Lake City to Quincy, by the
Pensacola and Georgia Railroad Company; and the branch,
from Tallahassee to St. Mark's, by the Tallahassee Railroad
Company. These companies were chartered in 1853 ; and after
the passage by the State legislature, Jan. 6, 1855, of a certain
act entitled "An Act to provide for and encourage a liberal
system of internal improvements in this State," they severally
availed themselves of its provisions, and issued bonds which
were duly guaranteed by the trustees of the internal-improvement fund created by the act. This fund consisted of the five
hundred thousand acres of public lands which became vested
in the State under the grant made by Congress for the purposes
of internal improvement by the act of Sept. 4, 1841 (5 Stat.
455), and of some fifteen millions of acres of swamp and
overflowed lands granted by act of Congress of Sept. 28, 1850,
to enable the State to construct the necessary levees and drains
to reclaim the same. 9 Stat. 519. By the internal-improvement act of Jan. 6, 1855, above referred to, these lands and
their proceeds were constituted a distinct and separate fund, to
be called "The Internal Improvement Fund of the State of Florida," and were vested in the governor of the State, the comptroller, treasurer, attorney-general, and register of State lands,
and their successors in office, in trust to dispose of the same,
and invest the proceeds, with power to pledge the fund for the
payment of the interest on the bonds (to the extent of $10,000
per mile) which might be issued by any railroad companies
constructing roads on certain lines indicated by the act. The

Oct. 1875.]

STATE OF FLORIDA V. ANDERSON ET AL.

671

companies, after completing their roads, were to pay, besides
interest on their bonds, one per cent per annum on the
amount thereof, to form a sinking fund for the ultimate payment of the principal. The act declared that the bonds should
constitute a first lien or mortgage on the roads, their equipment
and franchises; and, upou a failure on the part of any railroad
company accepting the act to provide the interest and the payments to the sinking fund as required thereby, it was made the
duty of the trustees to take possession of the railroad and all
its property, and advertise the same for sale at public auction.
In the management of the fund the trustees were to fix the
price of the lands, having due regard to their location, value
for agricultural purposes, &c., and make such arrangement for
drainage of the overflowed lands as in their judgment might be
most advantageous to the fund and the settlement and cultivation of the land; and they were directed to encourage actual
settlement and cultivation of the lands by allowing preemptions under such rules and- regulations as they might
deem advisable, but not more than one section of land to any
one settler. Other duties of a public character in relation to the
lands were devolved upon the trustees by subsequent enactments.
At the close of the war, the railroads were in a dilapidated
condition; and, the companies having failed to pay the interest
and the instalments due to the sinking fund on their bonds, the
roads were seized and sold by the trustees under the provisions
of the act. The first section, from Jacksonville to Lake City,
was sold in 1868, and the purchasers procured an act of incorporation under the name of " The Florida Central Railroad Company." The other two sections were sold on the 20th of March,
1869, for an amount equal to the principal of the outstanding
guaranteed bonds issued on them; and, the purchasers being
allowed the privilege of paying the purchase-money by deliver.
ing the bonds at their par value, nearly $1,000,000 of them were
thus surrendered and cancelled. But a balance of about,5472,000 remained unpaid. By some contrivance of the purchasers
(which both the complainants and E. C. Anderson and his
associates agree in characterizing as fraudulent), this balance
was not paid at all, but was only formally settled by inducing
the agents of the trustees to accept a check for the amount,

STATE OF FLORIDA V. ANDERSON ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

upon the receipt of which they delivered to the purchasers a
deed for the property which had been executed for that purpose and placed in their hands, and the purchasers possessed
themselves of the road. This check was never paid. Anderson and others, defendants, or represented in this cause, hold
upwards of $300,000 of the still outstanding guaranteed bonds
of the Pensacola and Georgia and Tallahassee Railroad Companies, which the purchasers failed to deliver up, besides $103,000 which are in dispute.
The purchasers of the Pensacola and Georgia and Tallahassee Railroads, and their associates or assigns, applied to the
legislature of Florida for a new charter, which was granted to
them with the name of " The Tallahassee Railroad Company;"
but after a few months, having procured another charter with
enlarged powers, creating a corporation by the name of "The
Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Mobile Railroad Company," they
consolidated their interests with that company as early as May
or June, 1870, and have ever since been known under that
designation. It is conceded by Anderson and the other bondholders, and is clearly the result of the evidence in the case,
that this company, whilst it succeeded to the rights of the purchasers at the trustees' sale, received the property subject to the
vendor's lien for the payment of the balance of the purchasemoney due on that sale. An adjudication to this effect has
been made against the company in the suit in Duval County
Circuit Court, hereinafter referred to.
The act which incorporated the Jacksonville, Pensacola, and
Mobile Railroad Company authorized that company to consolidate and acquire all the roads before mentioned, and to extend the same from Quincy westward to the western boundary
of the State in the direction of Mobile; and, with a view to aid
the company in the completion of this work, the same act, as
amended by an act passed Jan. 28, 1870, authorized the governor of the State to loan to it the bonds of the State to an
amount equal to $16,000 per mile, in exchange for an equal
amount of first-mortgage bonds of the company. In order to
secure the principal and interest of the company's bonds, it
was declared that "the State of Florida shall, by this act, have
a statutory lien, which shall be valid to all intents and pur-

Oc. 1075.]

STATE OF FLORIDA V. ANDERSON ET AL.

poses as a first mortgage, duly registered, on the part of 'the
road for which said bonds were delivered, and on all the property of the company, real and personal, appertaining to that
part of the line which it may now have or may hereafter
acqui'e, together with all the rights, franchises, and powers
thereto belonging; and, in case of failure of the company to
pay either principal or interest of its bonds or any part thereof
for twelve months after the same shall become due, it shall be
lawful for the governor to enter upon and take possession of
said property and franchises, and sell the same at public auction."
Under this power, State bonds to the amount of $4,000,000
were delivered to the company in exchange for $3,000,000 of
the company's bonds and $1,000,000 of the bonds of the Florida
Central Railroad Company, and have been in whole or in part
disposed of.
The balance of purchase-money accruing on the trustees' sale
still remaining unpaid, and the Jacksonville, Pensacola, and
Mobile Railroad Company having also failed to pay the interest
on their bonds, delivered in exchange for State bonds as aforesaid, a suit was instituted in March, 1872, by the State of Florida and the trustees of the internal-improvement fund against
the company, in the Circuit Court of Duval County, at Jacksonville, to recover, by a sale of the railroad, the said balance of
purchase-money, which was claimed to be a lien thereon. By
an amended complaint, all known parties having liens against
the railroad were made defendants. Anderson and the other
first-mortgage bondholders, who are defendants in this suit,
were not made parties, because their interest was not then
deemed adverse to that of the State. Holland was not made a
party, because at that time he claimed no interest in the prop
erty. On the commencement of this suit, the Duval County
Circuit Court appointed Jonathan C. Greeley receiver to take
possession of the railroad and secure its receipts and earnings.
But immediately a crop of litigation sprang up, hostile to the
rights asserted by the State and trustees. It was contended
that the territorial jurisdiction of the court did not extend beyond the county limits, and that the authority of the receiver
was limited thereby, and that the Florida Central Railroad
Company was not consolidated with the Jacksonville, Pensacola,
VOL. I.

43

STATE OF FLORIDA v. ANDERSON ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

and Mobile Railroad Company; and other positions antagonis
tic to the rights and proceedings of the State were assumed,
and suits were commenced in various courts to carry out these
views. Amongst others, the Leon County Circuit Court (at
Tallahassee) entertained a suit brought by some first-mortgage
bondholders, and appointed a receiver, who took possession of
the western part of the road. The result was, that the receiver
appointed by the Duval County Court was dispossessed of the
entire line.
At this point, in July, 1872, the defendants, Anderson and
his associates, commenced a suit in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Northern District of Florida against the
Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Mobile Railroad Company, and
the trustees of the internal-improvement fund, upon the firstmortgage bonds held by them, claiming that these bonds were
still a lien on the railroad, or at least entitled the holders to
claim the unpaid purchase-money before referred to, and praying
a sale of the road to pay their demand. The trustees pleaded
to the jurisdiction of the court, alleging for cause, amongst
other things, that it appeared by the bill and exhibits that the
subject-matter of the bill was in the jurisdiction and possession
of a circuit court of the State. The bill was thereupon voluntarily dismissed as against the trustees; and, by an arrangement
made with the railroad company (which withdrew its answer),
the complainants obtained a consent decree on the 19th of
December, 1872, declaring the bonds a first lien on the railroad,
and directing it to be sold to pay the same. An execution was
issued on this decree and placed in the marshal's hands, and a
sale' of the property was advertised. In September, 1873,
Anderson and his associates filed in the same court another
bill to carry into execution their said decree, making the trustees
of the internal-improvement fund defendants, charging them
with an intent to seize the railroad, and praying an injunction
against their so doing.
Meantime the defendant, Holland, had commenced a suit in
the said Circuit Court of the United States against the Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Mobile Railroad Company, to recover
compensation for alleged services; and on the 2d of December,
1872, he recovered a judgment by default for over $60,000, and

Oct. 1875.]

STATE OF FLORIDA v. ANDERsON ET AL.

675

issued executon thereon. Under this execution the marshal
advertised and sold the whole railroad in May, 1873; and
Holland became the purchaser for the price of $20,000,
and entered into possession. By an arrangement made with
Anderson and his associates, Holland kept possession until
the appointment of a receiver by this court.
Under these circumstances the State of Florida filed the bill
in this suit, setting forth the principal facts before rehearsed,
and praying that the sale under Holland's judgment might be
declared null and void, and that he might be enjoined from
setting up any rights under it; that the decree obtained by
Anderson and others might be set aside and declared null and
void, and that they might be enjoined from setting up any
rights under it. The bill having stated that the principal of
the internal-improvement bonds held by the defendants was
not yet due, and would not be due for many years to come,
the complainant prayed the court further to decree that the
defendants have no right to payment of their principal until
their bonds mature; and that they are bound to resort to the
internal-improvement fund as a primary fund for the payment
of both principal and interest before resorting to the railroad.
The bill concludes with a prayer for alternative and general
relief.
It having become manifest to us in the course of the proceedings that the interest of all parties required that the fund in
litigation should be under the control of this court, we appointed a receiver to take charge of the railroad, and operate
the same.
A demurrer to the bill having been overruled, answers were
filed by the defendants, and proofs taken; and the case is now
before us on the pleadings and the evidence.
It is not our purpose to discuss minutely the questions of fact
that have been raised by the parties. The most material questions are either conceded by all the parties, or are so free from
doubt as to render such discussion unnecessary. Our conclusions thereon will become manifest as we proceed to give our
general views upon the case.
The first question which naturally presents itself is, whether
the State of Florida has such an interest in the subject-matter

676

STATE OF FLORIDA V. ANDERSON ET AL.

[Sup. Ut.

of the suit, and in the controversy respecting the same, as to
give it a standing in court. It is suggested that the trustees of
the internal-improvement fund are the only parties legally
interested, and that they have no right to bring an original
bill in this court. To this it may be answered, in the first
place, that the State has a direct interest in the subject-matter
(the railroad in question) by reason of holding (as it does) the
four millions of bonds which are a statutory lien upon the road.
In the next place, the interest of the State in the internalimprovement fund is sufficiently direct to give it a standing in
court, whenever the interests of that fund are brought before a
court for inquiry.
From the statement already made in reference to the history
and character of this fund, and the duties of the trustees in
regard to it, it is apparent that the trustees are merely agents
of the State, invested with the legal title of the lands for their
more convenient administration; and that the State remains in
every respect the beneficial proprietor, subject to the guaranties
which have been made to the holders of railroad bonds secured
thereby. The residuary interest .in the fund belongs to the
State. The fact that the trustees consist of the governor and
other executive officers, and that they are charged with the
duties of drainage, reclamation, and settlement of the public
lands (duties of a purely public character), shows that they are
mere public agents invested with an important branch of the
State administration.
Now, to protect its interests, it is competent for the State,
seeking equitable relief against citizens of another State, to file
an original bill in this court. The reference to the trustees in
the bill cannot affect the jurisdiction of the court, inasmuch as
they are not the litigants before it. It has frequently been
decided in the circuit courts, where the jurisdiction depended
on the citizenship of the parties, that such jurisdiction is not
ousted, where there has been occasion to make a formal pa-rty
of a sheriff or other public officer by reason of his having a writ
of execution, or being named as obligee in an official bond sued
for the benefit of private parties, provided that the real parties
to the litigation have the requisite citizenship. Thus an administration bond given to the surrogate or to the governor of

Oct. 1875.]

STATE OF FLORIDA v. ANDERSON ET AL.

677

a State may be sued in his name in the Circuit Court of the
United States, though not having the requisite citizenship,
if the party for whnze benefit the suit is prosecuted has the
requisite citizenship. These authorities apply equally to the
case of the marshal who was named in the bill, but against
whom no relief was sought. Several of the cases are reviewed
in the recent case of the Coal Conany v. Blatchford,11 Wall.

172, td a further discussion of the subject at this time is
unnecessary.
We come, then, to the principal question in the cause; which
is, whether upon the pleadings and evidence in the case the
complainant has ground for the relief sought, or for analogous
relief, admissible under the general prayer of the bill.
The equitable lien for the unpaid purchase-money accruing
upon the trustees' sale of the railroad in 1869 resulted primarily to the trustees as the vendors, and became binding on the
road in the hands of all subsequent purchasers taking with
notice of the non-payment. As before stated, the Jacksonville,
Pensacola, and Mobile Railroad Company undoubtedly took
the property subject to this lien; and it has been so decided in
the Duval County suit. The defendant, Holland, stood in no
better situation. He had full knowledge of the circumstances
before obtaining his judgment, and purchased only the right,
title, and interest of the company. His claim to hold the
property clear of the lien, and to take the rents and profits,
when the State is seeking to have the road and profits secured
and applied to the satisfaction thereof, is inequitable and unjust.
Independent of any claim of the State under the $4,000,000 of
bonds issued in 1870, he has no right to oppose it in its efforts
to secure satisfaction of the original purehse-money of the
property. His judgment may be perfectly valid as against the
railroad company, and he may have acquired under it all
the right, title, and interest of said company; but nothing
more. As against the claims of the State, he has no right to
appropriate to himself the possession and emoluments bf the
property. His employment of judicial process for that purpose,
even though the powers of the receiver should be successfully
controverted, is inequitable so long as the rights of the State
are sustained, or not disaffirmed by the proper courts.

STATE OF FLORIDA

v. ANDERSON ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

As to the bonds given by the railroad company to the State
in 1870 in exchange for its bonds, Holland does not directly
question their validity, though he insists that the latter were
issued in violation of the constitution of the State. The validity of these bonds is a delicate question, and one which it is
eminently proper that the courts of Florida should determine.
The judges of the Supreme Court of that State, in answer to
certain questions propounded by the governor, in accordance
with a provision of the State constitution, have given an official
opinion which has been generally understood as favorable to the
validity of the bonds. Until that court shall decide the contrary, we prefer to take that view; and, regarding the bonds of
the company as valid and binding, the right of the State as
against the pretensions of Holland to control the possession
and emoluments of the property cannot be doubtful. Should
the State courts hereafter determine against the validity of
those bonds, further consideration of the subject can be had.
Of course, if it were necessary to do so, this court would not
hesitate to pass upon that question; but we do not deem it
necessary in this suit, which, in its nature, is rather to be regarded as ancillary to the judicial proceedings adopted by the
State in Florida.
The position of Anderson and his associates is different.
They claim that their bonds are still a first lien on the railroad, notwithstanding the trustees' sale; and that at all events,
though the principal of their bonds is not due, they are entitled
to prosecute the lien for the unpaid purchase-money due on said
sale in order to obtain satisfaction of their bonds. They claim
that their right to do this is paramount to that of the State or
the trustees, inasmuch as the amount to be recovered is applicable to the payment of the said bonds; and this is really
the question at issue between these parties. Its solution requires that we should examine a little more carefully the precise nature of the guaranty given to the bonds, and chargeable
upon the internal-improvement fund. The entire third section
of the act of Jan. 6, 1855, on which the controversy principally
depends, is as follows: " SECT. 3. Be it further enacted, That all bonds issued by any
railroad company under the provisions of this act shall be recorded

Oct. 1876.]

STATE OF FLORIA v. ANDERSON ET A..

679

in the comptroller's office, and so certified by the comptroller, and
shall be countersigned by the State treasurer, and shall contain a
certificate on the part of the trustees of the internal-improvement
fund that said bonds are issued agreeably to the provisions of this
act, and that the internal-improvement fund, for which they are
trustees, is pledged to pay the interest as it may become due on
said bonds. All bonds issued by any railroad company under the
provisions of this act shall be a first lien or mortgage on the roadbed, iron, equipment, workshops, d4p6ts, and franchise; and upon
a failure on the part of any railroad company accepting the provisions of this act to provide the interest as herein provided on the
bonds issued by said company, and the sum of one per cent per
annum as a sinking fund, as herein provided, it shall be the duty
of the trustees, after the expiration of thirty days from said default
or refusal, to take possession of said railroad and all its property of
every kind, and advertise the same for sale at public auction to the
highest bidder, either for cash or additional approved security, as
they may think most advantageous for the interests of the internalimprovement fund and the bondholders. The proceeds arising
from such sale shall be applied by said trustees to the purchase
and cancelling of the outstanding bonds issued by said defaulting
company, or incorporated with the sinking fund; provided that,
in making such sale, it shall be conditioned that the purchasers shall
be bound to continue the payment of one-half of one per cent semiannually to the sinking fund until all the outstanding bonds are
discharged, under a penalty of the annulment of the contract of
purchase and the forfeiture of the purchase-money paid in."
Of course, the company giving the bonds is primarily liable
to the bondholders for principal and interest as they become
due, inasmuch as the bonds import on their face an absolute
promise to pay; and, on failure to pay, suit may be instituted
at once against the company. Back of this personal liability
of the company, the bondholder has a double security: first,
the. guaranty of the internal-improvement fund; and, secondly,
the statutory lien on the railroad. He cannot avail himself
of the latter directly, as he could if it were a mortgage given to
secure the bonds alone; but he must induce the trustees to act
in the mode pointed out by the statute. If they refuse to act
when they ought to do so, the bondholder may either compel
them to act by mandamus, or file a bill in equity to obtain the
relief to which he may be entitled.

680

STATE OF FLORIDA V. ANDERSON ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

It is seen, however, that the primary right to proceed against
the property is in the trustees, and not in the bondholders. But
if principal or interest become due and be unpaid, and the trustees have not the means to pay it from any available resources
of the internal-improvement fund in one case, or the sinking
fund in the other, it will be their absolute duty to proceed
against the property.
In the present case, the trustees did initiate proceedings, and
did sell the property by virtue of the lien created by the statute; and through that sale they succeeded in extinguishing a
large amount of the outstanding bonds. But the purchasers
failed to pay the entire purchase-money, and a vendor's lien
attached. The original lien of the bonds was consummated
and merged in the title which the purchasers acquired by the
sale. Anderson and company cannot set it up anew without
repudiating the sale, and bringing back upon the property, in
coexistence with their own claim, the lien of the $1,000,000 of
bonds which have been cancelled. This, it is presumed, they
are not prepared to do. Indeed, they nowhere attempt to
repudiate the sale. They claim, that, notwithstanding the
sale, the lien of their bonds still subsists. But this cannot
be. The sale was made by virtue of the joint statutory lien
of all the bonds, and vested in the purchasers a title clear of
them all, subject only to the vendor's lien for the purchasemoney. As already seen, by the internal-improvement act,
only the interest of the bonds is guaranteed upon the credit
of the internal-improvement fund: the principal is provided
for by the creation of the sinking fund, which is a charge on
the road in the hands of all purchasers until the bonds are satisfied. When a sale is made by the trustees for non-payment of
interest or sinking fund, and the principal of the bonds is not
due, they have an option (of course, after satisfying the arrears
of interest) either to purchase up and retire the bonds, or to
pay the balance into the sinking fund, and postpone the pay11-nt of the principal until the bonds arrive at maturity.
Which of these two things they shall do is entirely in their
discretion; and a purchase by them of a portion of the bonds
does not impose upon them the obligation to purchase the balance. Nor does a resolution to purchase bonds, formed at one

681

time, preclude them from changing that resolution at a subsequent time. The contrary position assumed by the defendants
we consider as untenable, and repugnant to the spirit of the
act.
In the present case, as we have seen, the principal of the
bonds is not due; and, if the trustees should collect the balance of purchase-money to-day, it would be in their option to
purchase the bonds or not. There is no stipulation in the
bonds that the principal shall become due by the non-payment
of the interest. The getting of a consent decree by the bondholders for the sale of the road to pay their bonds, and especially the principal thereof, in a proceeding in which neither the
State nor the trustees were represented, and when the latter
were pursuing their lawful remedy to subject the road to the
payment of the purchase-money (as was their duty to do), was
an inequitable interference with, and a fraud upon, their rights.
We are of opinion, therefore, that the defendants ought to
be enjoined from selling, taking possession of, or interfering
with the railroad property in question (that is to say, the line
of raihroad extending from Lake City to the Chattahoochee
River, and from Tallahassee to St. Mark's), so as in any manner to impede, obstruct, or hinder the State of Florida, or the
trustees of the internal-improvement fund, in taking possession
of the property, or in procuring it to be condemned and sold
for the purpose of raising and paying the unpaid purchasemoney, and such amount as may be adjudged or decreed by
the proper courts or tribunals in that behalf to be due to the
State upon the bonds delivered to its officers by the Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Mobile Railroad Company, under the act
of Jan. 28, 1870.
A decree will be made accordingly.
It will also be proper to continue the receiver appointed by
this court until the property can be delivered up to some proper
and competent officer or persons having the requisite authority
to receive the same.
The decree should contain a proviso that it is not intended
to preclude the right of Anderson and the other first-mortgage
bondholders to demand and receive from the State or the trustees, out of the proceeds of said property, or of said internal.

improvement or sinking funds, respectively, any amount of
principal or interest which may be or may become due on theh
bonds; nor to affect the validity of their decree in the Circuit
Court, except as above stated.
DECREE.

This cause coming on for hearing upon the pleadings and
proofs, and being argued by 11r. Bisbee for the complainant,
and by Mllessrs. Jackson, Carpenter, and Boyce for the defendants, and the court having considered of the same, it is now, on
this thirteenth day of December, 1875, ordered, adjudged, and
decreed, that the defendants, and each of them, be perpetually
enjoined from hindering, or interfering with, or disturbing the
State of Florida, or any of its officers or agents (including the
trustees of the internal-improvement fund of said State), or any
officer or receiver appointed or acting in its behalf, in the possession, management, or control of the railroad of the Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Mobile Railroad Company, extending from
Lake City westwardly to or beyond the Chattahoochee River,
and from Tallahassee to St. Mark's, with the appurtenances
thereof and property belonging thereto; and that Edward
C. Anderson, Jr., and others, defendants herein, holders of
first-mortgage bonds of the Pensacola and Georgia and Tallahassee Railroad Companies, in whose favor a decree was rendered in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern
District of Florida on the nineteenth day of December, 1872,
directing amongst other things a sale of said railroad, be perpetually enjoined from selling, or procuring to be sold, said
railroad and property under or by virtue of said decree, or any
decree supplementary thereto in the same case: provided,
however, that nothing herein is intended to preclude the right
of the said Anderson and others to demand and receive from
the State of Florida or the said trustees, out of the proceeds of
said property, or of said internal-improvement fund, or the
sinking fund provided in that behalf, respectively, the principal and interest which may be or may become due on their
said bonds; nor to affect the validity of the said decree, except
as above expressed: and provided, further, that this decree is
not intended to prejudice the right of the defendant, Daniel

P. Holland, to contest in any competent court or proceeding
the validity of the bonds issued by the Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Mobile Railroad Company in exchange for the bonds
of the State of Florida under the act of the legislature of said
State passed Jan. 28, 1870, recited in the pleadings in this
cause; nor to prejudice any right which said Holland may have
to redeem said railroad by the payment of the unpaid purchasemoney mentioned in the said pleadings, with all interest thereon
and lawful charges on said road, in case it should be adjudged
that the said bonds are invalid.
It is further ordered and decreed, that the legal costs and
charges of the State of Florida in this cause, and the fees and
costs due to the officers of this court therein, be allowed
and paid out of the moneys in the hands of the receiver.
It is further ordered, that the receiver do pay out of the
moneys in his hands the lawful fees and charges of the master
who took the depositions and proofs in the cause; and that he
settle his accounts before the clerk of this court, subject to the
direction and approval of the Chief Justice.
And all further equities and directions arising upon the
decree are hereby reserved.
At a subsequent day of the term, Hr. Edward N.JDie7ersom
submitted a motion, due notice having been given thereof, that
so much of the railroad and property thereto belonging as lies
between Quincy and the Chattahoochee may be surrendered to
James G. Gibbs, and that the receiver be discharged from that
portion of the railroad, and be ordered to pay said Gibbs for
the use thereof during such time as the same has been in the
possession of the receiver.
At the same time, Anderson and others filed a petition for further direction under the decree. The Jacksonville, Pensacola,
and Mobile Railroad Company filed a petition for the possession
of the road as against the State; and the complainant moved to
discharge the receiver, and surrender the entire property to such
agent as should be appointed by the State of Florida. A petition was also filed for the payment of legal costs, "charges, &o.
The matters arising upon the motions and petitions were
argued by Mr. B. N. Dickerson, Mr. 1. Bisbee, Jr., Mr. Hatt.

H. Carpenter, Mr. W. T. Boyee, Hr. W. . f. Davis, Mr. D. P.
Holland, and Mr. William Birney, on behalf of the respective
parties in interest.
MR. JUSTicE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

B: the decree made in this case, we granted an injunction
against the defendants to restrain them from hindering, interfering with, or disturbing the State of Florida in the possession,
management, or control of the Jacksonville, Pensacola, and
Mobile Railroad, extending from Lake City westwardly to or
beyond the Chattahoochee River, and from Tallahassee to St.
Mark's; saving to Edward C. Anderson, Jr., and others, holders
of the first-mortgage bonds, their right to demand and receive
from the State of Florida, or the trustees of the internalimprovement fund of said State, the amount due or to become
due on their bonds; and saving to the defendant, Daniel P.
Holland, the right to contest the bonds given by said company
in exchange for bonds of the State of Florida to the amount of
three millions of dollars, and any right of redemption which
the said Holland might have in said property. The rights
claimed by Holland have since been fully contested by him in
the State courts, and their decision is adverse thereto. The
Supreme Court of Florida has adjudged that the sale of the
railroad under Holland's execution was null and void as against
the State, and gave him no right to the possession or income
thereof. This decision relieves this court from any embarrassment as to the disposition of the property. The State is the
only proper party to receive it.
This suit was brought against Anderson and company and
Holland, to prevent them from intermeddling with the property
whilst being pursued by the State in due course of litigation in
the State courts. It was in part ancillary to the relief sought
there. When brought, neither of the defendants was a party
to that litigation, all being citizens of Georgia, and not personally amenable to the courts of Florida, except by their own
consent, or by being accidentally found there. Since then,
however, Holland has voluntarily made himself a party to the
suit in the State court, and has procured the decision referred
to. By that decision, it is determined that the bonds given by

Oct 1875.]

STATE OF FLORIDA V. ANDERSON E

685

the railroad company to the State in exchange for State bonds
in 1870 are valid to the extent of being security to the purchasers of the State bonds for the amount justly due to them,
and create a statutory lien on the railroad prior to the judgment obtained by Holland or any other party, and entitle the
State to seize and sell the same; and Holland has, therefore,
been perpetually enjoined by the State court from interfering
with the State in the possession of the road and its appurtenances. The majority of the Supreme Court went even
farther, and held, that, by the laws of Florida, the railroad could
not be levied on and sold under an execution at all.
Under these circomstances, and in view of the decree already
made by this court, it would be improper to direct the delivery
of the property to Holland. As this court has not cognizance
of the principal litigation in the case, and cannot make any
only called upon to
final disposition of the property, -being
decide on the conflicting rights of the State and the respective
defendants to the immediate possession of it,- the only thing
left for the court to do (having exercised all the jurisdiction it
was called upon to exercise) is to order the receiver to deliver
the property to the State, and to dispose of any moneys in the
hands of the receiver.
Holland strenuously insists that the property ought to be
restored to him, because he was in possession of it at the commencement of the suit. But he went into possession after the
commencement of the suit in the State court, and we have
expressly decided that his possession was inequitable; and,
before the appointment of a receiver by this court, he had been
deprived of that possession by the action of the State court.
The receiver appointed by that court had taken the property
out of his bands. It is true, we had required Holland to account
to us for the income, and regarded the seizure of the property
as interfering with that jurisdiction which the State itself, the
complainant here, and also the complainant and moving party
in the State court, had requested us to assume. We therefore
felt justified in appointing a receiver to take full possession of
the property; and the State court has since been held to have
had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter. But there is
nothing in these circumstances that gives Holland any right to

686

STATE OF FLORIDA

v. ANDERSON

ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

reclaim that possession when it may be resigned by our receiver.
Holland's claim has been overruled by both the judgment of
this court and of the State courts; and it would be worse than
a vain and idle ceremony to deliver the property to him after
these adjudications. It would be plunging the whole property
into a new sea of litigation.
The claim of Gibbs to the possession of the road west of
Quincy has more plausibility. It seems, that, at the commencement of this suit, Holland had possession of that part as a tenant of Gibbs. But the road is certainly a part of the entire
line, and the title of Gibbs is disputed by the State, who claims
that the statutory lien of the bonds issued in 1870 is paramount to all others; and neither Gibbs, nor any person holding
under him, was in possession when the receiver was appointed
by this court. Our receiver, in taking possession, did not take
it from his hands, but from the hands of the receiver appointed
by the State court, in the manner before adverted to. We
think that no injustice will be done, but that the interest of all
parties will be subserved, by delivering the road entire to the
agent appointed by the State to receive the property, subject to
the right on the part of Gibbs to institute legal proceedings
against said agent for testing the question as to his right of
possession. That part of the road, therefore, will be delivered
to said agent subject to this right, so that Gibbs may not be
embarrassed by being placed in the position of having to bring
suit against the State. The question of his right is a question
of law which can be submitted to the courts of Florida without
much delay or expense.
The counsel of Gibbs object that he is not a party to this
suit, and his rights ought not to be compromitted by the judgment or action of the court; and they insist that he ought to
be placed in statu quo ante bellum. We do not decide upon his
rights; we leave them just as they were: and as to the possession, we place it in the hands of the party at whose instance
the receiver was appointed who had possession when it was
assumed by this court.
As to the railroad between Lake City and Jacksonville belonging to the Florida Central Railroad Company, and which
is still in the possession of our receiver for the purpose of ob-

STATE OF FLORIDA V. ANDERSON ET AL.

687

taining payment of advances made by him in making necessary
improvements on the road, as the amount due for those advances has been much reduced, we see no reason for further
withholding the possession from the Florida Central Railroad
Company. That road, therefore, will be directed to be delivered to said company, but subject to a claim on the part of
the State to any balance which may be still due for the advances made by the said receiver, after all proper allowances to
said company upon a due adjustment of the accounts between
it and the receiver.
The court has taken into consideration various other matters
necessary to be adjusted; and the result to which it Ihas come
will be expressed in the decree now made, which will not
require further explanation. The balance of moneys that may
remain in the hands of the receiver, after all proper payments
and allowances, will be directed to be paid into the registry of
this court for future disposition upon the final settlement and
confirmation of the receiver's accounts.
The claim of Anderson and others remains, as regards the
possession and sale of the road, exactly as when the former decree was made. The fact that some of their bonds have
matured does not change their position in that respect.
The application of the Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Mobile
Railroad Company for the possession of the road as against
the State is not entitled to any consideration whatever. When
the company shall have paid the balance of purchase-money
due for the road, and the interest on its bonds, it will be time
enough for it to put forth its pretensions.
The following order will be entered: And now, on this first day of May, A. D. 1876, the court
being advised of certain proceedings and decrees had and made
by and before the Circuit Court for Duval County, in the State
of Florida, and by and before the Supreme Court of said State
in the cause mentioned in the bill and pleadings in this case,
wherein the State of Florida and the trustees of the internalimprovement fund of said State were plaintiffs, and the Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Mobile Railroad Company, and others.
were defendants, whereby it hath been held and adjudged that
the three thousand bonds for $1,000 each, issued by the said

[Sup. Ct.

company in the year eighteen hundred and seventy, in exchange
for State bonds, are valid and binding, and create a statutory
lien upon the railroad and property of said company, and that
by virtue thereof the said State is entitled to take possession of
said property and sell the same, not only to raise and pay the
unpaid purchase-money mentioned in the said original bill, but
also what may be justly due on said bonds; and that the sale
of said railroad and property under execution at the suit of
the defendant, Daniel P. Holland, was void and of no effect,
and gave him no right or title, as against the said State, to
the possession of said railroad and property, or to the income,
tolls, or revenues thereof; and it appearing that the possession
of that part of said railroad between Quincy and the Appalachicola River is claimed by one James G. Gibbs, but is a
part of the said Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Mobile Railroad,
and was not in possession of said Gibbs when the receiver
was appointed by this court, nor of any person claiming under
said Gibbs, and that his right to the possession thereof is denied
by the said State as the holder of said bonds; and the said State
of Florida, through its executive and the said trustees of the
internal-improvement fund, having deputed Dennis Eagan, the
commissioner of lands and immigration of said State, to receive the said railroad and property from the receiver of this
court: Therefore it is ordered and decreed, that Robert Walker, the
receiver appointed by this court, do, on or before the first day
of June next, deliver the said railroad and all its appurtenances, extending from Lake City to the Appalachicola River,
and from Tallahassee to St. Mark's, and all the rolling-stock
and property connected therewith, to the said Dennis Eagan,
commissioner of lands and immigration of the State of Florida
on behalf of said State; reserving, however, to said James G.
Gibbs, the right to institute against said Eagan and his successors having possession of said road any legal proceedings
for the determination of his claim to the possession of the
railroad between Quincy and the Appalachicola River, and the
delivery to said Eagan of that portion of said railroad is subject to said right of the said Gibbs to institute such proceedings. And as to the railroad and property of the Florida

ordered that the same be delivered to the said Florida Central
Railroad Company, subject to the payment of said balance that
may be now due after all proper allowances to the State of
Florida.
It is further ordered, that the said receiver do close and settle
up the business of his receivership with all convenient speed;
that he collect all moneys due for freights, passage, mail-service, and other services, and all dues of every kind which shall

and that he settle his accounts for all receipts and expenses as
receiver before the clerk of this court, who is hereby authorized to audit and settle the same -under the direction of the
Chief Justice ; and that he exhibit his vouchers therefor. It
is further ordered, that he have the use of all vouchers, reports, and statements connected with the operations or business
of the said railroad during his administration which he may
require in the settlement of his accounts, and that he be authorized to retain permanent possession of all books, papers, and
accounts connected with his administration of the property
during his receivership; giving access thereto, for the purpose
of necessary information, to the officers of the State having the
management of the said railroad.
It is further ordered and decreed, that out of the moneys in
the hands of the receiver, or that may come to his hands, arising
from the income, tolls, and revenues of said railroad, or other
sources connected therewith, over and above the charges and
expenses paid, he pay the following charges, demands, and
amounts, in the order in which the same are here named; that
is to say:TFirst, The costs and expenses of this suit, including the fees
