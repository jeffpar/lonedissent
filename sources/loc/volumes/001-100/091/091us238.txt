very early settled that a charge of incontinence against an
unmarried female, whereby she lost her marriage, was actionable
by reason of the special damage alleged and proved. Davis v.
Gardiner,4 Co. 16 b, pl. 11; Reston v. Pomfreicht, Cro. Eliz.
639.
Doubt upon that subject cannot be entertained: but the
special damage must be alleged in the declaration, and proved;
and it is not sufficient to allege that the plaintiff "has been
damaged and injured in her name and fame," which is all that is
alleged in that regard in the case before the court. Hartley v.
Herring, 8 Term, 133; Addison on Torts, 805; Hilliard on
Remedies (2d ed.), 622; Beach v. Ranney, 2 Hill, 309.
Tested by these considerations, it is clear that the decision
of the court below, that the declaration is bad in substance, is
correct.
Judgment affirmed.

MUTUAL BENEFIT LIFE INSURANCE Co-uPANT v. TIsDA.
In a suit brought by the plaintiff in his individual character, and not as administrator, to recover a debt upon a contract between him and the defendant,
where the right of action depends upon the death of a third person, letters of
administration upon the estate of such person granted by the proper Probate
Court, in a proceeding to which the defendant was a stranger, afford no legal
evidence of such death.

E RRO to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Iowa.
This action was brought, in December, 1867, by Mrs. Tisdale, upon a policy of insurance, bearing date March 1, 1866,
issued to her upon the life of Edgar Tisdale, her husband.
Evidence was given tending to show his death on the 24th of
September, 1866. This evidence consisted chiefly in his sudden and mysterious disappearance under circumstances making
probable his death by violence. It seems from the charge of
the court that evidence was given by the defendant tending to
show that he had been seen alive some months after the date
of his supposed death. To sustain her case, the plaintiff offered
in evidence letters of administration upon his estate, issued to
her by the County Court of Dubuque County, Iowa. The

defendant objected to the admission of this evidence. The
objection was overruled, and the letters were read in evidence;
to which the defendant excepted.
The court charged the jury that "the real question is,
whether Edgar Tisdale was dead at the time of issuing the
letters of administration. It is incumbent on the plaintiff to
prove that fact. She has shown, as evidence of that fact, letters of administration issued to her as administratrix by the
probate judge. It is the duty of the court to instruct you that
this makes a primafacie case for the plaintiff, and changes the
burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant. .. . Without contradictory evidence, these (the letters of administration)
give the plaintiff the right to recover." To the charge in this
respect the defendant excepted.
The defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury, that
"in an action brought by the plaintiff in her own right on a
contract between herself and the defendant below, and not in a
representative capacity, she must establish by competent testimony the death of the insured, independently of the letters of
administration;" and that, "when the issue in a suit brought
upon a policy of life insurance is the death of the insured,
letters of administration granted upon his estate are not prima
facie evidence of his death, where the suit is not brought by
his administrator." But the court refused to give such instructions; to which the defendant excepted. Judgment was rendered against the defendant, who sued out this writ of error'.
31r. Frederick T. Prelinghuysen and Hr. Edwin Z. Stanton
for the plaintiff in error.
The real question in this case is, whether, in an action brought
by a plaintiff in his own right upon a contract between himself
and the defendant, in which the issue is, whether a person who
has not been absent seven years is dead,- the legal presumption being that he is alive,- letters of administration issued
upon his estate by a probate coiut in an ex yarte proceeding
are sufficient evidence to countervail that presumption, shift
the burden of proof, and, in the absence of contradictory evidence, establish the death. In such an action, it matters not,
as respects their admissibility and effect, whether they were
granted to the plaintiff or to some third person.

It is believed, that, upon a review of adjudicated cases and
of the opinions of text-writers, the rulings of the court below
will be found to be opposed to the weight of authority on this
question. French v. French, 1 Dick. 268; Lloyd, .Executrix,
v. Finlayson, 2 Esp. 564; Thompson v. Donaldson, 3 id. 64;
Moons v. De Bernales, 1 Russ. 307; Clayton v. Greshamn,

Hubback on Ev. of Succession to Real and Pers. Prop.
(37 Law Lib.) 162.
Upon principle and analogy, as well as authority, it is submitted that letters of administration are not, in the case at bar,
admissible as proof of death. The only ground for their admission is, that granting them is a judicial act in the nature of
a judgment in rem. But a judgment is not evidence of any
matter to be inferred by argument therefrom, or which comes
collaterally in question, or is incidentally cognizable. The
Duchess of Kingston's Case, 11 St. Tr. 261; 1 Stark. on Ev.
257. The grant of letters to the piaintiff on the personal
estate of Edgar Tisdale was the res in the Probate Court.
Unless impeached for fraud, the grant is conclusive as to her
title in her representative capacity to that estate, and as to her
right to execute the trust of administratrix. This was directly
and conclusively adjudicated; but the death of Edgar Tisdale
is only matter of inference from such grant.
Mr. George Crane for the defendant in error.
Letters of administration are admissible as prima facie evidence of the death of the person upon whose estate they are

7 Pet. 348), it will be observed that the court below permitted
the jury to attach less weight to the letters than is ascribed to
them by some of the authorities.
H= delivered the opinion of the court.
In an action brought, not as administrator, but in an individual character, to recover an individual debt, where the right
of action depends upon the death of a third party,- to wit, an
insurance upon his life, -do letters of administration upon the
estate of such party, issued by the proper Probate Court, afford
legal evidence of his death? This is the question we are called
upon to dscide. It is presented sharply, and is the only question in the case.
The authority in favor of the admission of the letters as evidence of the death of the party, in a suit between strangers, is
a general statement to that effect in 1 Greenl. Ev. sect. 550.
The cases cited by the writer in support of the proposition
are Thompson v. Donaldson,3 Esp. 64; French v. French, Dick.
AR. JUSTICE

268; Hamblin's Case, 3 Rob. (La.) 130; Jeffers v. Badliff, 10

N. H. 245. In the case first cited, the authority does not support Mr. Greenleaf's statement. It was held that the letters
did not afford sufficient proof of death; and, no further evidence
being given, the verdict was against the claimant. In French
v. Frenth, the court held in terms against the theory that the
letters were evidence of death, "but, under all the circumstances,
admitted the probate as evidence of death." This case was
that of a bill filed by an heir against one in possession of the
estate; and in that case Mr. Greenleaf hardly contends that
the letters are evidence of death. In Tisdale v. Conn. Life Ins.
Co., 26 Iowa, 177, and in the same case in 28 Iowa, 12, cited
by the defendant in error, the law was held as claimed by her.
The other cases cited by the defendant in error are those where
the administrator or executor was a party to the suit in his
representative capacity, in relation to which a different rule
prevails.
In the New Hampshire case above cited, there was evidence
to sustain the ruling, independently of the letters; and the case
concedes that the law is otherwise in England, and bases itself
upon the peculiar organization of the courts of that State.

On the other hand, the text-writers - Phil. on Ev. (2d vol.,
93 m, ed. 1868); Tamlyn (48 Law Lib.), 154, referring to
loons v. De Bernales; Hubback on Succession, 162 (51 Law
Lib.) - concur against the rule laid down by Mr. Greenleaf.
In Ilifoons v. De Bernales, 1 Russ. 307, it was held that letters of administration were not prima facie evidence of death,
and the defect was supplied by other evidence. Lord Eldon
says, in. Clayton v. Graham, 10 Ves. 288, that it is the constant practice to require proof of death, and that probate is
not sufficient. In Leach v. Leach, 8 Jur. 211, Sir Knight
Bruce refused to order the payment of money upon letters
alone, but required other evidence. In Blackham's Case, 1 Salk.
290, it was held that the sentence of the Spiritual Court in
granting letters is not evidence upon any collateral matter
which would have prevented the issuing of the letters.
In speaking of judgments in rem, and where the judgment
may be evidence against one not a party or privy to it, Mr.
Starkie says, "This class comprehends cases relating to marriage and bastardy where the ordinary has certified; sentences
relating to marriage and testamentary matters in the Spiritual
Court." I Stark. on Ev. 372 m. What is meant by this is
explained at a subsequent place, where he says, "The grant
of a probate in the Spiritual Court is conclusive evidence
against all as to the title to personalty, and to all rights incident to the character of an executor or administrator." P. 374 m.
He cites, in support of this statement, the case of Allen v. Dundas, 3 T. R. 125, that payment of money to an executor who
has obtained probate of a forged will is a discharge to the
debtor. The grant is conclusive in all business transacted as
executor, and concerning the duties of the executor, that it
was properly made.
This accords with the principle hereafter laid down.
The chief ground of argument to admit letters testamentary
as evidence of the death of the party is, that the order of the
Probate Court issuing them is an order or judgment in rem.
But a judgment in rem is not prima facie evidence: it is conclusive of the point adjudicated, unless impeached for fraud.
1 Stark. on Ev. 372 m; Freeman, infra. If admissible on this
principle, the letters were conclusive evidence of the death of
Tisdale. But this is not claimed by any argument.

Oct. 1875.] MUTUAL BENEFIT LIFE INs. Co. v. TxsDALE.

243

Again: the Probate Court has never adjudicated that Tisdale
was dead. Death was not the res presented to it. Shall Mrs
Tisdale receive letters of administration, was the res; and upon
that only has there been an adjudication. Hubback, supra,
162 m.
The letters issued to an executor or an administrator by a
probate court are, as a general rule, evidence only of their
own existence. They prove, that is to say, that the authority
incident to that office or duty has been devolved upon the
person therein named, that he has been appointed, and that
he is executor or administrator of the party therein assumed
to have departed this life. Different States have different provisions as to who may be executor or administrator, excluding
some persons and preferring others, in the order and manner
in their statutes specified. Thus persons convicted of infamous crime are excluded from this office, and persons of notoriously evil lives may be passed by in the discretion of the
Probate Court. Sons or daughters or widows are entitled to
take in preference to others: unmarried women are entitled in
preference to married women. Certain notices may be, and
usually are, required to be given of the proceedings to obtain
letters; and the letters are the evidence that the proceedings
have been regularly taken, and that the person or persons
therein named are those by law entitled to the office. Upon
these points the court has adjudicated. No proof to the contrary can be admitted in an action brought by the executor
as such. Parties wishing to contest that point must do it
before the Probate Court at the time application is made for
the letters, or upon subsequent application, as the case may
require.
In an action brought by such executor or administrator
touching the collection and settlement of the estate of the
deceased, they are conclusive evidence of his right to sue for
and receive whatever was due to the deceased. The letters
are conclusive evidence of the probate of the will. It cannot
be avoided collaterally by showing that it is a forgery, or that
there is a subsequent will. The determination of the Probate
Court is upon these precise points, and is conclusive. 2 Smith's
Lead. Cas. (6th Am. ed.) 669; Vanderpool v. Van Valkenberg,

Co. v. TISDALE.

[Sup. Ct.

6 N. Y. 190; Collins v. _Boss, 2 Paige, 396; Freeman on Judgments, 507, citing numerous cases.
If the present suit were brought by the plaintiff as executor
or administrator to collect a debt due to her deceased husband,
or to establish a claim arising under a will, of which probate
had been made by her, she would have been within these rules.
The letters testamentary would not only have been competent
evidence, but they would have been conclusive of her right to
bring the suit, and unimpeachable except for fraud.
Such, however, is not the case before us. The suit is by the
plaintiff as an individual, to recover a debt alleged to be due
to her as an individual. It is a distinct and separate proceeding,
in which the question of the death of the husband has never
been passed upon. That fact must be established by proof
competent upon common-law principles.
The books abound in cases which show that a judgment upon
the precise point in controversy cannot be given in evidence in
another suit against one not a party or privy to the record.
This rule is applied not only to civil cases, but to criminal cases
and to public judicial proceedings, which are of the nature of
judgments in rem.
If an indictment for an assault and battery by A. upon B. is
prosecuted to a trial and conviction, the record is conclusive
evidence in favor of A. upon a subsequent indictment for the
same offence; but, if B. sues A. for the same assault and battery,
it cannot be doubted that it would be incompetent to introduce
that record as evidence of the offence. For this purpose, it is
inter alios acta. B. was no party to that proceeding. In theory
of law he was not responsible for it, nor capable of being benefited by it. 1 Stark. Ev. 317 m.
So, if B. should afterwards be indicted for an assault upon A.,
arising out of the same transaction, the record would not be
competent evidence to show that A., and not B., was in fact the
offending party.
In some States, provision is made for the admeasurement and
setting apart of dower to the widow of a deceased person.
Officers are appointed for this purpose, who make their certificate awarding particular property to her use, and file their
report in the proper office. Although this certificate is judicial

in its character, and assumes that the deceased had title to the
property described, and the certificate is valueless except upon
that supposition, it has still been held that it is no evidence of
title, and that the title must be proved as in other cases. Jackson v. .Randall, 5 Cow. 168; Same v. -l1y, 6 id. 816.
It has been held that a comptroller's deed for the non-payment of a tax due the State is not even primafacie evidence of
the facts giving him the right to sell, such as the assessment
and non-payment of the tax, although they are recited in the
deed, and this deed is in compliance with the statute. These
facts must have existed to give a right to sell; but they are not
established by the deed. They must be made out by independent proof. Tallman v. White, 2 N. Y. 66; TWlliams v. -Peyton, 4 Wheat. 77; Beekman v. Bigham, 5 N. Y. 866.

So it has been held, that where a sheriff sells real estate,
giving to- the purchaser a certificate thereof, although there
can lawfully be no sale unless there be a previous judgment,
and although the sale is based upon and assumes such judgment,
and although the law requires the sheriff to give such certificate,
the recital by the sheriff of such judgment furnishes no evidence
thereof. It must be proved independently of the certificate.

So on an application by a wife for alimony, pending a

Authorities of this nature might be greatly extended. Enough
has been said to demonstrate that neither upon principle nor

APPEAL from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.
On the 7th June, 1872, a decree was rendered by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in a suit in equity
between Horace S. Johnston, plaintiff, and George Usher, defendant, directing a sale of certain lands, the property of Usher.
In pursuance of this decree, a sale of the property was made
to John W. Butterfield on the 30th of September. This sale
was reported to the court Oct. 16; and on the 15th November an order of confirmation was entered, unless cause to the
contrary should be shown on or before Dec. 10. Cause was
not shown by the time limited; and thereupon, on the 12th
December, Butterfield paid the amount of his bid to the trustee who made the sale, and received from him a deed of the
property. Previous to this time, there had been no order of
the court directing a conveyance; but on that day the trustee
reported to the court that he had received the purchase-money,
and executed the deed; and thereupon an order was entered,
