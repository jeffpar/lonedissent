power does not exist even pending the partnership, did not find
it necessary to consider the effect of a dissolution upon it.
In Alabama, where a law was passed making service of process
on one partne'r binding upon all, it was expressly decided, after
quite an elaborate argument, that such service was not sufficient
after a dissolution of the partnership, and that acknowledgment
of service by one partner on behalf of all was also inoperative
as agaiist the other partners. -Duncan v. Tombeckbee Bank,
4 Port. 184; Demott v. Swaim's Adm., 5 Stew. & Port. 293.
In the case of Loomis & Co. v. Pearson & . eiekael, Harper (S. C.), 470, it was decided, that, after a dissolution of
partnership, one partner cannot appear for the other; although it is true that it had been previously decided by the
same court, in Hfaslet v. Street et at., 2 McCord, 311, that no
such authority exists even during the continuance of the partnership.
But the absence of authorities, as before remarked, is strong
evidence that no such power exists.
In our judgment, the defendant Lybrand had a right, for the
purpose of invalidating the judgment as to him, to prove the
matter set up by him in his offer at the trial; and for the refusal of the court to admit the evidence the judgment should
be reversed, with directions to award a venire de novo.

This suit was brought by Jones, assignee of Winslow, against

Clark, and revived after his death, against Sewall, his administrator. Jones alleged that Clark had infringed certain patents
for an improvement in preserving Indian corn, granted to Winslow; and he prayed for an injunction and an account. A decree
was rendered for the complainant. The defendant appealed.
Four patents were granted to Winslow; but it is only necessary to set forth two which were held good in the court below.
The principal defence relied on was that they were void for
want of novelty.
These two patents of Winslow and the specification of Durand's patent, which is mentioned in the opinion of the court,

The schedule referred to in these letters-patent, and making
part of the same, is as follows: "To all whom it may concern:"Be it known that I, Isaac Winslow, of Philadelphia, in the
county of Philadelphia and State of Pennsylvania, have invented a
new and useful improvement in preserving Indian corn in the green
state; and I hereby declare that the following is a full and exact
description thereof "In my first attempt to preserve Indian corn in the green state,
without drying the same, I did not remove the kernels from the
cob. The article thus obtained was very bulky, and, when used, the
peculiar sweetness was lost, the same being absorbed, as I suppose,
by the cob. After a great variety of experiments, I have overcome
the difficulties of preserving Indian corn in the green state without
drying the same, thus retaining the milk and other juices and the
full flavor of fresh green corn until the latter is desired for -ase.
Instead of a hard, insipid, or otherwise unpalatable article, I have
finally succeeded in producing an entirely satisfactory article of
manufacture, in which my invention consists. I have employed
several methods of treatment of the green corn with good results.
My first success was obtained by the following process: The kernels, being removed from the cob, were immediately packed in cans,
and the latter hermetically sealed, so as to prevent the escape of
the natural aroma of the 'corn, or the evaporation of the milk or
other juices of the same. Then I submitted the sealed cans and their
contents to boiling or steam heat about four hours. In this way
the rnlk and other juices of the corn are coagulated, as far as may
be; boiling thus preventing the putrefaction of these more easily
destructible constituents. At the same time, the milk and other
juices are neither diluted nor washed away, as would be more or
less the casE if the kernels were mixed with water and boiled. By
this method of cooking green corn in the vapor of its juices, as it
were, the ends of the sealed cans are bulged out, as though putrefaction and the escape of the resulting gases had commenced within
the cans. Consequently, strong cans are required; and dealers are

likely to be prejudiced against corn thus put up. I recommend the
following method: Select a superior quality of sweet corn in the
green state, and remove the kernels from the cob by means of a
curved and gauged knife, or other suitable means. Then pack
these kernels in cans, and hermetically seal the latter so as to prevent evaporation under heat or the escape of the aroma of the corn.
Now expose these cans of corn to steam or boiling heat for about
one hour and a half; then puncture the cans, and immediately seal
the same while hot, and continue the heat for about two hours and
a half longer. Afterwards the cans may be slowly cooled in a
room at the temperature of seventy to one hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Indian corn thus packed and treated may be warranted to
keep in any climate. Being preserved in its natural state as near
as possible, it retains the peculiar sweetness and flavor of fresh
corn right from the growing field. It is only necessary to heat this
preserved corn, and season the same, in order to prepare it for the
table, as it is fully cooked in process of preserving. Other methods
of treatment may be adopted without departing from my invention,
so long as the hermetical sealing and use of the heat are so managed
as to secure the aroma and fresh flavor, and prevent putrefaction;
thus producing the new article of manufacture substantially described.
"Having thus fully described my invention, what I claim and
desire to secure by letters-patent from the United States is the
above-described new article of manufacture; namely, Indian corn
when preserved in the green state, without drying the same, the
kernels being removed from the cob, hermetically sealed and heated,
substantially in the manner and for the purpose set forth.

The schedule referred to in these letters-patent, and making
part of the same, is as follows : "To all whom it may concern:"Be it known that I, Isaac Winslow, of Philadelphia, in the
county of Philadelphia, and State of Pennsylvania, have invented
a new and useful improvement in preserving green corn; and I do
hereby declare that the following is a full and exact description
thereof, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, and to
the letters of reference marked thereon :"It has long been common to boil green or unripened Indian
corn, or maize, and then dry the same for winter use. But corn
thus dried, when prepared for the table by again boiing, is more
or less hard and insipid, having lost the fine flavor of fresh green
corn.
"If ears of corn be boiled, and then hermetically sealed in cans,
the cob seems to absorb the sweetness of the kernels; or if the
kernels are removed from the cob after boiling, and then preserved,
the finest flavor of the natural corn is lost. After many and varied

176

[Sup. CO.

attempts to preserve green corn without drying the same, finding
that I did not obtain a satisfactory result, I finally conceived the
idea of first removing the corn from the cob, and then boiling or
cooking the kernels thus separated, and preserving them. But this
was met by a new difficulty. The kernels of corn being somewhat
broken by removal from the cob, the milk and other juices were
dissolved out in the process of boiling; and thus the corn was left
insipid and unpalatable. I then attempted to cook the corn without contact with water, by exposing the cans containing the corn
to boiling water.
"This mode of preserving I found unsatisfactory. The milk of
the corn was evaporated, and the corn more or less dried, whilst a
long time was requisite to cook the corn sufficiently for preservation. Finally I adopted the process of removing the corn from the
cob, packing the kernels in cans, hermetically sealing the same,
and then boiling the cans until the corn contained therein became
completely cooked. The result of this process was .extraordinary,
the corn being of finer flavor than corn fresh from the field when
boiled upon the cob in the usual way. Since this discovery, I have
adopted the practice of boiling or steaming the cans containing the
corn-kernels thus sealed about four hours, though a shorter time
may answer for most purposes.
"The cans should be very strong, to prevent their bursting by
heat. I have sometimes practised puncturing the cans after they
are well heated,- say for ten minutes. This allows the air to
escape; when I immediately reseal the cans, so as to prevent the
evaporation of the juices of the corn or the loss of the natural
aroma.
"This puncturing has two advantages: it prevents the possible
bursting of the cans; and allows the heads of the cans to press
inward when cool, so that dealers can see by this test that the corn
is perfectly preserved. When the cans are not punctured, their
ends will remain pressed outward after cooling, and yet the corn
is perfectly preserved. The above-described process of removing
the corn from the cob, and then preserving the kernels, affords several advantages over any method of preserving corn heretofore
known. Among these advantages are the following: 1st, The peculiar sweetness and excellent flavor of the corn thus preserved,
these qualities being consequent upon retaining all the milk and
other juices, together with its fine natural aroma; 2d, The economy
of space in boiling and packing, and convenience of handling, transportation, and sale. Having thus fully described my improved

process, what I claim, and desire to secure by letters-patent of the
United States, is the above-described process of first removing the
corn from the cob, and then preserving the kernels substantially in

PreservingAnimal and Tegetable Food.-- Durand'sSpecification.
" To all to whom thesepresents shall comer:"I, Peter Durand, of .Hoxton Square, in the county of Middlesex,
merchant, send greeting :"Whereas his most excellent Majesty King George the Third did
by his letters-patent, under the great seal of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland, bearing date at Westminster the
twenty-fifth day of August, in the fiftieth year of his reign, give
and grant unto me, the said Peter Durand, my executors, administrators, and assigns, his special license, full power, sole privilege and
authority, that I, the said Peter Durand, my executors, administrators, and assigns, during the term therein mentioned, should and lawfully might make, use, exercise, and vend, within England,Wales, and
the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, an invention communicated to
me by a certain foreigner residing abroad, of the method of ' preserving animal food, vegetable food, and other perishable articles,
a long time from perishing or becoming useless;' in which said
letters-patent there is contained a proviso, obliging me, the said
Peter Durand, by an instrument in writing under my hand and
seal, to cause a particular description of the nature of the said invention, and in what manner the same is to be performed, to be enrolled in his Majesty's High Court of Chancery within six calendar
months after the date of the said recited letters-patent, as in and by
the same, relation being thereunto had, may more fully and at large
appear : "Now know ye, that, in compliance with the said proviso, I, the
said Peter Durand, do hereby declare that the nature of the said

particularly described and ascertained as follows; that is to say "Tirst,I place and enclose the said food or articles in bottles or
other vessels of glass, pottery, tin, or other metals or fit materials;
and I do close the aperture of such containing vessels, so as completely to cut off and exclude all communication with the external

air; and as to the method of closing, I do avail myself of the usual
means of corking, airing, luting, or cementing; and in large vessels
I make use of corks formed of pieces glued together in such a manner as that the pores of that substance shall be in a cross-direction
with regard to the aperture into which such corks are to be driven ;
and I do also, in such vessels as may admit of or require the same,
make use of stoppers fitted or ground with emery or screw-caps,
with or without a ring of leather or other soft substance between
the faces of closure, and also of cocks or cross-plugs or covers of
leather, cloth, parchment, bladder, and the like.
"1Secondly,When the vessels have been thus charged and well
closed, I do place them in a boiler, each separately surrounded with
straw, or wralpped in coarse cloth, or otherwise defended from striking against each other; and I fill the said boiler so as to cover the
vessels with cold water, which I gradually heat to boiling, and continue the ebullition for a certain time, which must depend upon the
nature of the substances included in the vessels, and the size of the
said vessels, and other obvious circumstances, which will be easily
apprehended by the operator without further instructions. Vegetable substances are to be put into the vessel in a raw or crude state,
and animal substances partly or half cooked, although these may
also be put in raw. The food or other articles thus prepared may
be kept for a very long time in a state fit for use, care being taken
that the vessel shall not be opened until their said contents shall be
wanted for consumption.
"And, lastly, I do declare, that although the application of the
water-bath, as hereinbefore described, may be the most commodious and convenient, I do likewise avail myself of the application of
heat by placing the said vessel in an oven, or a stove, or a steambath, or any other fitsituation for gradually and uniformly raising
the temperature of the same, and suffering them to cool again; and,
farther, that I do, as the choice of the consumer or the nature of
the said food or other articles may render preferable, leave the
aperture of the vessel, or a small portion thereof, open until the
effect of the heat shall have taken place, at which period I close
the same.

Mr.B. N..Dickcerson for appellant.
The process claimed is substantially described in specificatious of Durand and Gunter published in the United States
and England before the application for the patents in question.
The original discovery was by Appert, a scientific Frenchman.
Hfr. W. ff. Clifford, contra.
The English patent of Durand was the invention of Appert;
but the process described in Durand's patent does not cover the
invention of Winslow.
iMR. JusTICE HIuT delivered the opinion of the court.
Jones, as assignee of four several patents for a new and
useful improvement in preserving Indian corn, brought his
action against Clark, the original defendant, alleging infringements of the same. These patents were issued to Isaac Winslow, and were as follows: viz., No. 34,928, dated April 8,1862,
"for a new and useful improvement in preserving Indian corn;"
No. 35,274, dated May 18, 1862, "for a new and useful improvement in preserving green corn;" No. 35,346, dated May
20, 1862, and No. 36,826, dated Aug. 26, 1862.
The two patents last above mentioned were declared and adjudged by the court below to be void; and from this judgment
no appeal has been taken. They are no longer elements in the
case before us, and are dismissed from further consideration.
The patent first mentioned is for an article of manufacture, a result. The second one is for a process by which a result is
obtained. The first is the more full, and embraces all that is
contained in the second.
The first objection made to the patents is the want of novelty.
It is contended that they were anticipated by the Appert process embodied in the Durand patent of 1810; also by the patent
of Gunter of 1841, and by that of Wertheimer of 1842. It is

SEWALL V. JONES.

,

[Sup. 0t.

an elementary proposition in patent law, that, to entitle a plaintiff to recover for the violation of a patent, he must be the
original inventor, not only in relation to the United States, but
to other parts of the world. Even if the plaintiff did not know
that the discovery had been made before, still he cannot recover if it has been in use or described in public prints, and if
lie be not in truth the original inventor. Dawson v. Pollen,
2 Wash. C. C. 311; Bedford v. Hunt, 1 Mas. 302.
Durand's patent is described in his specification, enrolled in
the English Court of Chancery, as based "upon an invention
communicated to him by a certain foreigner, residing abroad,
of the manner of preserving animal food, vegetable food, and
other perishable articles, a long time from perishing or becoming useless."
In describing the nature of the invention and the manner in
which the same is to be performed, he says, "P1irst, I place the said food or articles in bottles of glass, pottery, tin, or other metals or fit materials, and I close the aperture
so as completely to cut off or exclude all communication with the
external air;" and he describes the various means of effecting that
purpose.
"Second, When the vessels are thus charged and well closed, 1
place them in a boiler, each separately surrounded with straw or
wrapped in a coarse cloth, or otherwise defended from striking
against each other. I fill the boiler so as to cover the vessels with
cold water, which I gradually heat to boiling, and continue the
ebullition for a certain time, which must depend upon the nature
of the substances included in the vessels, and the size of the vessels,
and other obvious circumstances which will be readily apprehended
by the operator. Vegetable substances are to be put into the vessel
in a raw or crude state, and animal substances partly or half cooked,
although these may also be put in raw."
The specification then declares that the inventor did avail
himself of the application of heat by placing the vessel in an
oven, stove, steam-bath, or other fit situation for gradually and
uniformly raising the temperature and suffering it to cool again,
and that as the choice of the consumer or nature of the said food
or other artihles may render preferable, leave the aperture of the
vessel, or a small portion thereof, open until the effect of the

heat shall have taken place, at which period the same is to be
closed.
The points following are embraced in this patent:1. It is for the purpose of preserving for a long time animal
or vegetable food.
2. The articles thus to be preserved are to be placed in tin
or other vessels, so arranged as to exclude communication with
the extjrnal air.
3. An aperture may be left in the vessel, at the choice of the
operator, until the effect of the heat shall have taken place,
when it is to be closed.
4. The vessels thus prepared are placed in a boiler filled with
cold water, which is heated to a boiling point, which boiling
shall be continued for such time as shall be required by the
substances contained in the vessels.
5. Although a water-bath is preferred, the inventor declares
that he avails himself of heat through an oven, stove, steambath, or any other situation fit for gradually raising the tbmperature and suffering it to cool again.
6. Vegetables are to be put into the vessels in a raw or crude
state; animal substances raw or partly cooked.
7. The invention is general in its terms, embracing all vegetables and all animal substances capable of being thus dealt
with.
Winslow's patent of April 8, 1862, No. 84,928, is declared to
be for an improvement in preserving Indian corn in the green
state.
The letters-patent declare that the first "success of the inventor was obtained by the following process: The kernels,
being removed from the cob, were immediately packed in cans
hermetically sealed, so as to prevent the escape of the natural
atoma of the corn or the evaporation of the milk or other juices
of the same. I then submitted the sealed cans and their contents to boiling or steam heat for about four hours. . . . By
this method of cooking green corn in the vapor of its juices, the
ends of the cans are bulged out. Strong cans are required, and
dealers are likely to be prejudiced against corn thus put up. I
recommend the following method: Select a superior quality of
green corn in the natural state; remove the kernels from the

SEWALL V. JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

cob by means of a curved and gauged knife, or other suitable
means; then pack in cans, hermetically seal the cans, expose
them to steam or boiling heat for about an hour and a half,
then puncture, seal while hot, and continue the heat for about
two hours and a half." At the close, the inventor says 'hat
what he claims to secure by the patent is the new article of
manufacture; namely, Indian corn preserved in the green state
without drying, the kernels being removed from the cob, hermetically sealed, and heated as described.
Let us now state the points embraced in this, the plaintiff's
patent, and compare them with the points heretofore stated as
included in the Durand patent.
1. Winslow's declared object is the preservation of Indian
corn in the green state.
Durand's is for preserving Indian corn not only, but all vegetable substances in their raw or crude state.
2. Winslow recommends removing the kernels from the cob
before the process of preservation is commenced, placing the
kernels in cans, sealing them, and exposing them to heat.
Durand, not limiting himself to the article of corn, provides
that the articles to be preserved shall be placed in cans, and subjected to heat in the same manner. He does not stipulate or
recommend that the article shall be first removed from the cob,
the vine, the twig, or whatever may be the natural support of
the vegetable to be preserved, as the corn from the cob, the pea
from its pod, the grape or the tomato from its vine, the peach
from its stem, the berry from its stalk. Neither does he recommend that it shall not be so removed. His process embraces
the article in whatever form it may be presented. It is for the
preservation of raw or crude or uncooked vegetables in whatever form they may be presented, and necessarily includes a
case where they have been previously removed from their natural support. A prior removal from the stalk would be the
natural, and, in many cases, a necessary proceeding.
3. Winslow directs that the kernels shall be subjected to the
heat for a period of about one and a half hours before puncturing, and for about two and a half hours after the puncturing.
The double use of the word "about" indicates that the time is
aot to be considered as precisely specified.

Oct. 1875.]

SEWALL V. JONES.

Durand directs that the boiling shall continue for such length
of time as shall be required by the particular substances contained in the vessel. Corn, pease, tomatoes, peaches, berries,
asparagus, may very likely require great difference in the time
in which the heat shall be applied to produce the required
effect. In each case, that is to be the measure of the time.
4. Winslow says other modes may be adopted so long as hermetical sealing and the use of heat are so managed as to secure
the aroma and fresh flavor and prevent putrefaction.
Durand declares that he intends to include in his patent heat
through an oven, stove, steam, or any other situation by which
the temperature is gradually raised and suffered to cool again.
The same idea is put forth at the close of Winslow's specification, where he declares that what he claims by his patent is
the manufacture of Indian corn in its green state, the kernels
being removed from the cob, hermetically sealed, and heated.
We are of the opinion that the substance of all that is found
in Winslow's patent had, nearly half a century before he obtained his patent, been put forth in Durand's patent. If Durand's patent were now in force in -this country, and a suit
brought upon it against Jones, the claimant under Winslow,
for an infringement, the right to recover could not be resisted.
Durand would show a patent intended to effect the same purpose,- to wit, the preservation of vegetables for a long time;
employing the same process, -to wit, the effect of heat upon
vegetables placed in a metallic vessel, the gradual cooling of
the same, hermetically sealed after puncture to allow the escape
of gases. This is also Winslow's process.
To constitute an infringement, the thing used by the defendant must be such as substantially to embody the patentee's
mode of operation, and thereby to attain the same kind of
result as was reached by his invention. It is not necessary that
the defendant should employ the plaintiff's invention to as good
advantage as he employed it, or that the result should be the
same in degree; but it must be the same in kind. Winans v.
Dennead, 15 How. 830.
To infringe a patent, it is not necessary that the thing patented should be adopted in every particular. If the patent is
adopted substantially by the defendants, they are guilty of

SEWALL V. JONES.

[Sup. Ct

infringement. Boot v. Ball, 4 McLean, 177; Alden v. Deney,
1 Story C. C. 336.
In an action for infringement, the first question is, whether
the machine used by the defendant is substantially, in its principle and mode of operation, like the plaintiff's. If so, it is an
infringement to use it. Howe v. Abbott, 2 Story C. C. 190;
Parker v. Hauntk, 4 McLean, 370.
If he has taken the same plan and applied it to the same
purpose, notwithstanding he may have varied the process of
the application, his manufacture will be substantially identical
with that of the patentee. Curtis, sect. 312.
Erskine, J., says, in Walter v. Potter, Webs. Pat. Cas. 585,
607, the question of infringement depends upon whether the
plan which the defendant has employed is in substance the
same as the plaintiff's, and whether all the differences which
have been introduced are not differences in circumstances
not material, and whether it is not in substance and effect a
colorable evasion of the plaintiff's patent.
When a party has invented some mode of carrying into
effect a law of natural science or a rule of practice, it is the
application of that law or rule which constitutes the peculiar
feature of the invention. He is entitled to protect himself
from all other modes of making the same application; and every
question of infringement will present the question, whether the
different mode, be it better or worse, is in substance an application of the same principle. Curtis, sect. 320.
It is said, however, that a distinction exists in this, -that
Winslow's patent provides that the corn shall be removed from
the cob before the process begins, and that Durand does not
specify this idea. If this be conceded, it does not alter the
case. Although he may preserve Indian corn by removing it
from the cob more advantageously than by letting it remain
on the cob, he does it by using the Durand process. He still
applies Durand's process of heating, puncturing, and cooling,
and no more takes the practice out of Durand's patent than if
he should specify that pears or peaches would be the better
preserved if their outer coating should be first removed, or that
meat could the better be preserved if the bones were previously
extracted. Whether the improvement or combination could be
the subject of a patent, it is not material to consider.

It is said again, that "instead of packing the kernels in the
vessels selected for the purpose, in their crude state, as suggested in the English patent, the process patented by the
assignor of the plaintiff directs that the kernels should be cut
from the cob in a way which leaves a large part of the hull on
the cob, and breaks open the kernels, liberating the juices, to
use the language of the patentee, and causing the milk and
other juices of the corn to flow out and surround the kernels
as they are packed in the cans, in such a mode that the juices
form the liquid in which the whole is cooked, when the cans
are subjected to the bath or boiling water."
This argument is based upon an error in fact. There is no
such language in the patent. The sole expression of the patent
is to provide, first, that the corn shall be removed from the cob;
and, second, that it shall be subjected to heat in vessels hermetically sealed. Thus Winslow recites that difficulty had been
encountered by him in preserving the corn upon the cob. This
produced an insipid article; and accordingly he says, "Ml y first
success was obtained by the following process: The kernels, being removed from the cob, were immediately packed in cans and
hermetically sealed, so as to prevent the escape of the aroma,
and submitted to heat," &c. There is not a word in the patent
to the effect that the kernels shall be cut off in a particular
way, or that a large part of the hull shall be left on the cob,
nor, indeed, that the kernels shall be cut off at all. It is simply
provided that the corn shall be removed from the cob. The
means are not specified.
Farther on, the patentee, Winslow, says, "I recommend the
following method." This is not of the substance of the patent.
A recommendation is quite different from a requirement. The
latter is a demand, an essential, a necessity. The former is a
choice or preference between different modes or subjects, and
is left to the pleasure or the judgment of the operator. He
may adopt it. He will do well if he does. But he may reject
it, and still accomplish his object by means of the patent.
The principle is this: The omission to mention in the specification something which contributes only to the degree of
benefit, providing the apparatus would work beneficially and
be worth adopting without it, is not fatal, while the omission

SEWALL V. JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

of what is known to be necessary to the enjoyment of the invention is fatal. Curtis, sect. 248.
An excess of description does not injure the patent, unless
the addition be fraudulent. Id. sect. 250.
Accordingly, when the inventor says, "I recommend the following method," he does not thereby constitute such method a
portion of his patent. His patent may be infringed, although
the party does not follow his recommendation, but accomplishes
the same end by another method.
But the patentee does not even recommend that the kernels
shall be cut off in such manner that a large portion of the hull
shall remain upon the cob, nor does he distinctly recommend
the cutting off of the kernels in any manner. His recommendation is simply that the kernels be removed by any convenient
and suitable method. His language is, "I recommend the followhg method: Select a superior quality of sweet corn in the
green state, and remove the kernels from the cob by means of
a curved and gauged knife or other suitable means." Any
means that are suitable for removing the kernels, whether by
knife or any other method, are within this language.
That the simple removal of the corn from the cob, before it
is subjected to heat, without reference to cutting it off in such
manner as to leave a portion of the hull on the cob, or without
reference to cutting at all, is the claim of Winslow's patent, is
clearly shown by another consideration.
The first patent of Winslow and his second patent, as stated
in the opinion of the court below, are intended to effect the
same purposes; the one being a patent for the article, the
other for the process by which the article is produced. "Both
patents (it is there said) may be considered together, as all the
proofs applicable to one apply equally to the other; and the
positions taken in argument are the same in both, without an
exception."
Now, it is quite significant of the intent of the claimant, and
of the meaning of the first patent, that his second patent, which
is for the process, and would properly be more specific as to
every essential mode, makes no claim that the corn shall be
removed from the cob by cutting, much less that it should be
cut in any particular manner, or with a view to any particular

Oct. 1875.]

SEWALL V. JONES.

effect. After describing his disappointment in the result when
he merely cooked the corn, and in attempting to preserve it when
packed, without removal from the cob, or where it was removed
after having been boiled on the cob, he says, "Finally I adopted
the process of removing the corn from the cob, packing the kernels in cans, hermetically sealing the same, then boiling the cans
until the corn contained therein became completely cooked."
The word "cutting" is not to be found in this patent. Removal
from the cob before commencing the preservation, without reference to the manner or means, except only that they should be
suitable, is the plain intent of both patents. In this respect they
axe identical with each other, and axe not inconsistent with Durand's patent.
The discovery in question has been of immense benefit to
mankind. By means of food preserved in a compact and nutritious form, protected from its natural tendency to decay,
deserts are traversed, seas navigated, distant regions explored.
It is less brilliant, but more useful, than all the inventions for
the destruction of the human race that have ever been known.
It is to France that the honor of this discovery belongs, and to
Appert, a French citizen. It does not belong to America or to
Winslow. Appert's process presents all that we now know
upon the subject. It contains absolutely every thing of value
that is contained in Winslow's patent.
Other grave questions are presented by the record before us.
We are satisfied, however, to place our decision upon the ground
that the want of novelty in the patents of Winslow is fatal to
the rlaintiff's right of recovery. We do not discuss the other
questions.
The decree must be reversed, and a decfee ordered in favor of
the defendant below.
MR. JUSTICE CLIF OBD dissenting.
Damages are claimed in this case by the complainants for an
alleged infringement of two certain letters-patent, which axe
fully described in the bill of complaint. Those letters-patent
are as follows: (1.) No. 34,928, dated April 8, 1862, for a new
article of manufacture; namely, Indian corn when preserved in
the green state, without drying the same, the kernels being

SEWALL V.

JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

removed from the cob, hermetically sealed, and heated, substantially in the manner and for the purpose set forth in the specification. (2.) No. 35,274, for a new and useful improvement in
preserving green corn.
Two other patents were included in the bill of complaint; but
they were held to be invalid in the court below, and are not in
ihsue in this investigation.
Both the patents in issue were introduced in evidence at the
hearing; and the repeated decisions of this court have established the rule, that a patent duly issued, when introduced in
evidence by the complainant in a suit for infringement, is prima
facie evidence that the patentee is the original and first inventor
of what is therein described as his invention.
Much consideration need not be given to the question of infringement, as the respondent admits that his foreman put up
seven hundred cans of green corn, preserved by the same process substantially as that described in the letters-patent of the
complainants.
Viewed in the light of these suggestions, it is clear that the
decision of the case depends upon the defences set up in the
answer. Of the separate defences pleaded, it will be sufficient to examine the first, as the decision of the court is placed
chiefly on the defence set up in that part of the answer; which
is, that the assignor of the patentee is not the original and first
inventor of the improvements described in the respective letterspatent.
Defences involving the validity of a patent cannot be satisfactorily examined or their sufficiency or insufficiency determined without first ascertaining what the inventions are which
are the subject-matter of the controversy. Beyond doubt, the
invention secured by the first patent is for a new and useful
manufacture described as Indian corn preserved in the green
state. What the inventor desired to accomplish was to preserve the unripe corn in the green state for table use, without
drying the same; and he states, that, in his first attempt to accomplish the desired result, he did not remove the kernels from
the cob, but that the product manufactured in that mode was
not satisfactory, as the article obtained was very bulky, and
failed to retain the peculiar sweetness of green corn cooked in

Oct. 1875.]

SEWALL V. JONES.

the ordinary way, the same being absorbed, as the patentee
supposes, by the cob.
Experiments of various kinds were made to overcome the
difficulties attending the effort to preserve the corn without
drying the same, which were also unsuccessful, as the kernels
when preserved did not retain the milk and other juices of the
corn, leaving the product hard, insipid, and unpalatable, and
without the full flavor of fresh green corn. All such experiments were, therefore, abandoned; but he finally succeeded in
producing an entirely satisfactory new article of manufacture,
which is the one described in the specification and claim of the
first patent.
His description of the method he adopted in manufacturing
the product is substantially as follows: Select a superior quality
of sweet corn when in the milk or green state; remove the ker-.
nels from the cob by means of a curved and gauged knife or
other suitable means; pack the kernels with the juices of the
same in cans, and hermetically seal the cans, so as to prevent
evaporation under heat, or the escape of the aroma of the corn.
Other suitable means are such means, and such only, as will
perform the same functions. When packed, the cans with their
contents are to be exposed to steam or boiling heat for an hour
and a half; then take the cans out of the steam or boiling heat
and puncture the cans, and immediately reseal the same while
hot, and continue the heat for two hours and a half longer.
Exposure to heat in the manner stated is for the purpose of
cooking the contents of the cans; and, when that is accomplished,
the cans may be taken out of the boiling heat, and be slowly
cooled in a room at the temperature of seventy to a hundred
degrees Fahrenheit. Green corn thus packed and treated, the
patentee states, may be warranted to keep for an indefinite
period in any climate. Being preserved in its natural state as
near as possible, it retains the peculiar sweetness and flavor of
fresh green corn right from the growing field; and it is only
necessary to heat the corn in order to prepare it for the table,
as it is fully cooked in the process of preserving.
Argument to show that the commissioner may grant a patent
for a product or new manufacture and one for the process is
quite unnecessary, as that question is now firmly settled in

2. Pursuant to that rule, the second patent of the complainants was issued, which embodies an invention for a new and
useful improvement in preserving green corn; or, in other words,
the patented invention is for the process of manufacturing the
new product described and secured to the inventor in the other
letters-patent.
Applicants for a patent are required to describe their respective inventions; but an invention for a product and an invention
for the process to produce the product bear so close a relation
to each other, that it is difficult even for an expert to describe
the latter without more or less reference to the former. Defects
of the kind, however, are of no importance, if the patent for the
product contains no claim to the invention for the process.
Separate applications may be made in such a case; or the
inventor, if he sees fit, may describe both inventions in one
application. Accordingly, the patentee in this case presented
only one application in the first place for both patents; but,
pending the hearing in the Patent Office, he filed separate
specifications, the second containing some of the same phrases
as those employed in the specification describing the invention
of the new manufacture. Among other things, he admits that
it has long been common to boil green or unripened corn, and
then to dry the same for winter use; but he adds that corn
thus dried must be boiled again when prepared for the table,
and that it is more or less hard and insipid, as it loses the fine
flavor of fresh green corn. Ears of corn also, he says, are
sometimes boiled, and hermetically sealed in cans: but the cob
seems to absorb the sweetness of the kernels; or if the kernels
are removed from the cob after boiling, and then preserved, still
the fine flavor of the natural corn is lost.
MV[any and varied attempts were made by the patentee to
preserve green corn on the cob without drying the same; but
all his efforts in that behalf were unsuccessful, as they left the
article dry and unpalatable, as the sweetness of the green corn
was absorbed by the cob. Experiments of the kind having all

Oct. 1875.]

SEWALL V. JONES.

failed, he conceived the idea of first removing the corn from
the cob, and then boiling or cooking the kernels, and preserving
them as separated from the cob.
Some benefit, it seems, resulted from that new conception;
but a new difficulty arose, from the fact, that, the kernels of
corn being more or less broken in being removed from the cob,
the milk and other juices of the corn were dissolved and diluted
by the water in the process of boiling, leaving the product insipid, unpalatable, and comparatively tasteless.
Unable to overcome the difficulty in that mode, he next attempted to cook the corn without allowing it to come in contact
with the water, by exposing the cans containing the corn to
boiling water; but he soon found that that mode of preserving
the corn was unsatisfactory, as a long time was required to,
cook the corn sufficiently for preservation, and the corn became
more or less dried and hard.
Sufficient has already been remarked to show that both patents may be considered together, for the reason that all the
proofs applicable to the patent for the product are equally applicable to the patent for the process, and the positions taken in
argument are the same in both, without an exception.
Want of novelty is the principal defence set up in the answer;
and the court decides that the respective patents are invalid,
chiefly upon the ground that the foreign invention secured to
Peter Durand is prior in date. Before examining that defence,
it becomes necessary to refer somewhat more fully to the nature
and peculiar characteristics of the respective improvements, in
order that the evidence introduced may be correctly understood
and properly applied.
Unripe ears of corn may be boiled and hermetically sealed in
cans without infringing the inventions of the patentee; but the
difficulty with that product is, that the cob absorbs the sweetness of the kernels, and the article becomes insipid and unpala.
table, and consequently it is not salable to any considerable
extent. Sales of such a product do not infringe the patents of
the complainants; and it is clear that the kernels may be removed from the cob, and then preserved in cans in the ordinary
mode, without any conflict with the improvements embodied in
the complainants' patents: but the product which such a process

SEWALL V.

JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

produces is comparatively valueless, as the fine flavor of green
corn cooked in the usual way for table use is lost in the process
of manufacture.
Indian corn may also be preserved when in a green state by
removing the kernels from the cob, and boiling or cooking the
same before the kernels are packed in cans hermetically sealed,
without subjecting the manufacturer to the charge of infringing the patents described in the bill of complaint; but the decisive objection to that process is, that the kernels, or many of
them, in being removed from the cob, are broken, and consequently the milk and other juices of the corn in that state are
dissolved out in the process of boiling or cooking, and the natural
aroma of green corn cooked in the usual way is lost, and the
,product becomes of little or no value as an article of commerce.
Attempts were made by the patentee in this case to remedy
that difficulty by packing the kernels in cans not sealed, and
exposing the cans containing the kernels to boiling water; but
the experiments were not satisfactory, as it required a long
time to cook the corn, during which the milk and other juices
of the corn evaporated, and left the kernels dry and hard. All
such experiments having failed, the inventor adopted the process of removing the corn from the cob by means of a curved
and gauged knife, and packing the kernels with the milk and
other juices of the same in cans hermetically sealed, and then
boiling the cans with their contents until the same became
completely cooked: but he states that the cans containing the
corn must be very strong, or the internal pressure will cause
them to burst; and, to prevent that, lie practised puncturing
them after they became well heated, to allow the air to escape,
immediately resealing the same to prevent the evaporation of
the juices of the corn and the loss of its natural aroma.
Sealed cans, if sufficiently strong, it would seem, may be used
to complete the process without the necessity of puncturing
during the period they are exposed to the boiling bath; but,
unless the cans are very strong, the recommendation is to puncture them, in order to relieve the internal pressure and to
prevent them from bursting. Other advantages result from
puncturing the cans which deserve consideration. Even if the
cans when not punctured do not burst, still the air contained

Oct. 1875.]

SEWALL V. JONES.

in the same and the vapor become more or less expanded by
the heat, so as to press the heads of the can outward, giving
the can the appearance of cans which contain gaseous products
of decomposition; and the statement is, that such appearances,
even when the corn is perfectly preserved, diminish the value
of the product as an article of commerce, and show that it is
better to puncture and reseal the cans during the process of
boiling.
Looked at in any light, it is clear that the purpose of the
invention secured by the second patent, as evidenced by the
langpuage of the description, is to preserve not only the farinaceous elements of the kernels, but also the milk and juices of
the same which give the peculiar aroma or flavor to green corn
when cooked for the table in the usual way, during the season
when the kernel is full, but before the milk and juices of the
kernel become concrete, as in ripe corn.
Beyond all doubt, the patented process, if the directions are
properly followed, will accomplish the purpose for which it
was invented, and will enable the manufacturer to preserve the
kernels of the green corn, with all the milk and juices which
the kernels contain, without any chemical or other change
except what is produced by the cooking, which is effected by
putting the sealed cans containing the kernels with their milk
and other juices, just as the same were removed from the cob
by the curved and gauged knife, into the boiling water for the
periods specified in the description of the specification.
Proof to that effect of the most satisfactory character is exhibited in the record; and the fact that the product of the
patented process, to the extent that it has become knowi, has
driven the product of all other processes intended to effect a
like result out of the market, attests its accuracy and truth.
Suffice it to say, that the remarks made are sufficient to explain
and describe what the inventions are which give rise to the
present controversy; and, having accomplished that purpose,
the next inquiry is, whether the assignor of the complainants
was the original and first inventor of the respective improvements.
Examined merely in the light of the pleadings, the affirmative of the issue is upon the complainants; but, the complainVOL. X.

13

SEWALL V.

[Sup. Ct.

ants having introduced the respective patents in question, the
rule is well settled that the burden of proof is changed, and
that it is incumbent upon the respondent to show by satisfactory proof that the alleged inventor was not the original and
first inventor of the respective improvements, as they have
alleged in their answer.
Ample time was given to both parties in the Circuit Court
to prepare for a hearing, and the respondents attempted to
meet the issue in two ways:Suppose it be true that the assignor of the complainants
was the first person in the United States who practised the
patented process, and preserved green corn even in that mode
of operation: still it is contended that the alleged inventor was
not the original and first inventor of the improvement, because
the process had been previously known and used in a foreign
country: but the Circuit Court ruled and determined that the
mere previous knowledge or use of a thing patented in a foreign country was not sufficient to defeat a patented invention
granted under the Patent Act; that no evidence of the kind
could have that effect, unless it appeared that the same invention had been previously patented in some foreign country, or
been described in some public work, anterior to the supposed
discovery thereof here by the alleged inventor; that it is wellsettled law, that the mere introduction of a foreign patent or a
foreign publication, though of a prior date, will not supersede
a domestic patent, unless the description or specifications or
drawings contain or exhibit a substantial representation of the
patented improvement in such full, clear, concise, and exact
terms as to enable any person, skilled in the art or science to
which the invention appertains, to make, construct, and practise
the invention to the same practical extent as he would be enabled to do if the information was derived from a prior patent
issued in pursuance of the Patent Act. Seymour v. Osborne,
11 Wall. 555.
Unable to controvert those propositions, the respondent next
refers to the English patent granted to Durand, and insists that
it supersedes both of the patents of the assignor of the complainants. His patent bears date the 30th of August, 1810;
and the specification states, in substance, that he encloses the

Oct. .1875.]

SEWALL V. JONES.

food or articles to be preserved in bottles, or other vessels of
glass, pottery, tin, or other metals or fit materials, and closes
the apertures of the vessels so as completely to cut off and exclude all communication with the external air. When the
vessels have been thus charged and well closed, he places them
in a boiler, each sepaately surrounded with straw or wrapped
in coarse cloth, or otherwise defended from striking against
each other. He then fills the boiler so as to cover the vessels
with cold water, and gradually heats the water till it boils, and
continues the ebullition for a certain time, which, as he says,
must depend upon the nature of the substances and other obvious circumstances.
Vegetable substances, the specification states, axe to be put
into the vessels in the raw or crude state. Animal substances
are to be partly or half cooked, although these may be put in
raw; and he adds that articles thus prepared may be kept for
a very long time and in a state fit for use; and no doubt is entertained that unripe corn prepared in that way may be kept
for a long time, as it is evident that the kernels would be dried
by the heat, but they would necessarily cease to have the flavor
of fresh green corn when cooked in the usual way for table use.
Confirmation of that is found in what immediately follows in
the specification, which shows that the patentee also claims the
application of heat in other modes, as by placing the vessels in
an oven or a stove, the effect of which, beyond all doubt, would
be to dry the kernels, and make it necessary to reboil the contents of the vessel in order to fit the same for table use.
Certain vegetable substances may, perhaps, be preserved to
advantage in that way; but it is clear that the application of
high heat to the vessels containing green corn, unless the kernels were surrounded by water or some other suitable liquid,
would necessarily dry the kernels, and render them unfit for
table use without soaking or reboiling. Doubtless the term
"vegetable substances" is comprehensive enough to include
green corn: but the patentee, in enumerating the articles to be
preserved, does not mention green corn; and, of course, the specification contains nothing to indicate whether the kernels are or
axe not to be removed from the cob before they axe placed in
the bottles or other vessels; or, if to be removed, in what man-

SEWALL V. JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

ner the removal is to be effected; nor whether the kernels are
to be left whole or broken, as in the mode of operation described
in the patents in question.
Corn at that period was unknown in England, and it is not
probable that the patentee had ever heard of such an atticle,
and it does not appear that a can of green corn has ever been
preserved in that mode of operation to the present time. Patented inventions must be described so that those skilled in the
art or science may be able to make, construct, and practise the
same; and yet it is plain that no amount of study or examination of the foreign specification would ever enable any person
to preserve green corn in the mode of operation employed by
the assignor of the complainants.
Study it as you will, and the conclusion must be that the
vegetable substance, whatever it may be, is to be placed in the
bottles or other vessels in the raw or crude state, without any
previous preparation, and without any liquid to prevent the substance from drying. Indian corn on the cob, or unbroken
kernels of green corn, cannot be preserved in that way so as to
possess any commercial value.
Instead of packing the kernels in the cans in their crude
state, the process patented by the assignor of the complainants
directs that the kernels should be cut from the cob in a way
which leaves the coarser part of the hull on the cob, and breaks
open the kernels, liberating the juices, to use the language
of the patentee, and causing the milk and other juices of the
corn to flow out and surround the kernels as they are packed in
the cans, in such a mode that the milk and juices of the kernels
form the liquid in which the whole is cooked when the sealed
cans are subjected to the bath of boiling water. Water is never
added to the mixture to be preserved; nor is it necessary, as the
liquid composed of the milk and juices of the kernels is sufficient
to prevent the heat from drying the vegetable substance to be
preserved; and, if water should be added, it would dilute the
milk and other juices, and render the product insipid and
valueless.
Evidently much is due to that feature in the patented mode
of operation in preserving the product in its natural state, and
causing it to retain the sweetness, peculiar flavor, and natural

Oct. 1875.]

SEWALL V. JONES.

aroma of green corn fresh gathered from the field, and boiled in
the usual way for table use. Nothing of the kind is suggested
in the foreign patent; and it is clear that a careful comparison
of the description of the complainants' patents with that of the
Durand patent fully justifies the opinion of the learned expert
examined by the complainants, that the two patented processes
are essentially and substantially unlike, and confirms the con
clusion already expressed, that persons having no other knowlledge of the complainants' process than -what they can derive
from perusing the specification of the foreign patent would never
be able to preserve green corn by the complainants' mode of
operation.
Palpable as those differences are, they ought not to be overlooked in determining the issues between these parties. Meritorious inventors are entitled to protection; and the proofs are
full to the point that the product, manufactured by the process of the complainants, is far superior to that preserved in any
other mode; which, beyond all question, is the cause that induced
the respondent to abandon other methods, and to practise the
patented process at the risk of a suit for infringement.
Other vegetables, such as beets and carrots, or pease and
beans, may be packed in cans in a crude state under the foreign
process, as they retain their juices, and may perhaps be tolerably
well preserved in that mode of operation if entirely secluded
from the atmosphere, as by packing ripe vegetables in hermetically-sealed cans; but the chemical composition of such
vegetables is very different from green sweet corn, which is
much more difficult to preserve in its natural freshness without
loss of its peculiar flavor and aroma, as accomplished by the
complainants' process. When the kernels are cut from the cob,
they are opened, and the milk and other juices flow out, and become the liquid in which the kernels are to be cooked, and the
milk and the other juices become a constituent part of the
vegetable substance to be preserved.
Prompt action is required to accomplish the object; for, if the
mixture is exposed to the air for any considerable time before
the cans are filled, the chemical relations of the constituents
will be changed, and the whole substance will become sour and
unwholesome. Exposure to heat, if seasonable, will prevent
that tendency, as the relations of the constituents of which the

SEWALL V.

JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

mixture is composed will become fixed, and the danger of putrefaction or souring will be greatly diminished, or be entirely
averted.
Throughout the experiments, the aim of the patentee was to
perfect the process of preserving green corn without losing any
of the flavor of the milk and natural juices of the cereal in its
green state, and to discover the method or means of fixing the
constituents or elements of the corn when in the milk, so that,
when packed in vessels to be preserved, the chemical relations
of the constituents of the substance to each other would never
change, unless the vessels containing the mixture were opened.
Such a purpose, it is obvious, could not be accomplished by
packing the corn in cans in the crude state, or before the kernels were removed from the cob, as the juices of the kernels
would be absorbed by the cob in the cooking: nor could he
accomplish his object by cutting the kernels from the cob and
boiling them in water before they were packed in the cans, or
by cooking the kernels in open vessels without water; as in
the one case the milk and other juices would be washed out of
the kernels, and with that operation all the peculiar flavor of the
cereal in the green state; and, in the other case, the aroma and
juices of the kernels would be lost by evaporation.
His process includes the mode of preparing the mixture for
filling the cans, as well as the mode of cooking and preserving
the same; for, if it did not, the great aim he had in view would
not be accomplished. Preserved green corn, unless it is packed
and cooked in its own milk and juices, is of very little value, as
it is only in that mode of operation that the preserved articles
will retain the peculiar flavor and sweetness which the cereal
possesses when fresh gathered from the field and cooked in the
usual way.
No doubt the kernels may be removed from the cob without
cutting, and may be preserved in that form under the process
described in the foreign patent: but the decisive answer to that
concession is, that that process is not the process of the complainants; and the product preserved in that mode of operation
is of a very inferior quality, as appears by the concurrent testimony of all the witnesses. Sweet corn in the green state is a
peculiar substance, differing in material respects from any other
cereal or vegetable used for food. Its constituents are such, that

Oct. 1875.]

SEWALL V. JONES.

it is singularly susceptible to fermentation, decomposition, and
change, -more so than any other vegetable that has been successfully preserved in hermetically-closed vessels for any considerable length of time. Such liability to rapid change is not
due to any one particular constituent, but to the presence of
several, such as gluten, sugar, fat, and starch, in such proportions as are calculated to promote fermentation and action upon
each other. As compared with sweet pease, for instance, the
kernels of sweet corn are much more delicate, and liable to
change, as they contain a much larger proportion of milk,
juice, or sap, which itself contains more sugar, starch, and oil
than the juice of sweet pease, and the glutinous constituents
which act as the ferment or primary cause of change are much
more active in the juice of sweet corn than in that of sweet
pease.
Equally instructive support to the same view is derived by
comparing sweet corn with such fruits as peaches, as the juice
of the peach contains no oil and more water than the corn,
besides other differences of an equally important character;
showing that such fruits as peaches are much less liable to
ferment than sweet corn, and that they are much more easily
preserved.
Examined in the light of these suggestions, as the case should
be, it is clear that the mode of operation described in the complainants' specification differs widely from every process which
preceded it, and that it effects a new and highly useful result.
Wide differences in the mode of operation from any thing which
it is proved ever existed before is shown in every descriptive
feature of the complainants' specification; and so palpable and
marked are those differences, that it would create astonishment
and surprise if any competent expert can be found who would
now venture to testify that the foreign process given in evidence
is the same as that practised by the complainants.
Groat injustice, in my opinion, is done to the appellees in this
case: but they may still enjoy the satisfaction to know, that,
while courts of justice may alter the names of things, they
cannot change the things themselves without exercising positive invention; nor can they obliterate the relation between
cause and effect, for the reason that the law which regulates
that relation is irrepealable.
