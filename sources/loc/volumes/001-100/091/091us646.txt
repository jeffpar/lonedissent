PHILLIPS AND COLBY CONSTRUCTION COMPAINY V. SEYMIOUn
ET A.L.
1. A., who had undertaken to build a railroad for a company, entered July 18,
1872, into a sealed contract with B. for building a hundred and sixty
miles of the road. The contract, among other things, provided that B.
should complete the first section, of forty miles, on or before the first day of
September then next ensuing; the third section, of twenty miles, by the
fifteenth day of that month; the fourth section, of twenty miles, on the
fifteenth day of the following November; the fifth section, of twenty miles,
on the fifteenth day of December; and so on ; the whole to be completed
May 1, 1873. Payment was to be made to B. as the work progressed, the
15th of each month, on monthly estimates, by the engineer of the railroad
company, of the work done the previous month, except fifteen per cent
after the completion of forty miles, which was to be retained as security
for the performance by B. until the work should be completed, and to be
forfeited to A., and applied to any claim for damages which he might sustain by the failure of B. to have the stipulated work completed at the time
specified. Fifteen per cent of the estimates on the first forty miles, and a
liquidated sum of $15,000 agreed to be paid for extra work on that section,
were to be retained as security for the completion of the first sixty miles.
B. failed to finish any portions of the work by the specified time; but A.,
although authorized by the contract to declare it forfeited, excused the
failure, paid B. the estimate for the work then done, and permitted him
to proceed with the work. B. continued to do so until A. failed to pay the
large sums due him by the estimates for work done in October and November. B. then learned from A. that the latter was unable to pay those estimates, and would probably be unable for a time to pay future monthly
estimates. B. thereupon ceased to do any further work, and brought this
suit. Held, 1. That the declaration of B. was sufficient on demurrer, as
it averred, in substance, that from the time he entered upon the performance of the contract in July, 1872, until the fifteenth day of December of
that year, when A. wholly failed to make the stipulated payment for the work
then actually done, he, with a large force and with suitable equipments along
the whole line of the road, had prosecuted the work with all the energy and
skill that he possessed, and that A. had expressed satisfaction at the manner in which the work was done. 2. That A. so far waived absolute performance on the part of B. as to consent to be liable on his covenant for
the contract price of the completed work, but did not waive his right to
whatever damages he may have sustained by the failure of B. to perform

ETC. (ONST.

Co. v. SEYmOUR ET AL.

647

such work by the specified time, and that A. might set up such damages by
way of cross-demand against B. 3. The court below erred in charging the
jury that time was not of the essence of the contract sued on, and that such
damages could not, therefore, be recovered; but, inasmuch as there was no
legal evidence of such damages, the misdirection of the court worked no
prejudice to A., and affords no ground for reversing the jugment. 4. That.
B. was not required, after A. had defaulted on a payment due, to proceed
with the work at the hazard of further loss; and that he was entitled to
recover the contract price of the work done, together with the fifteen per
cent on the estimates, and the $15,000, both of which had been retained by
A. as a security for B.'s performance of the contract.
2. In an action of covenant, evidence of a parol contract is inadmissible. Had
the declaration averred such a contract, it would have been bad on demurrer
in the courts of Ilinois, as the common-law rules of pleading and the distinction between forms of action prevail in that State.

3. Fifty-two assignments of error were filed in this case. The court condemns
such a practice as a flagrant perversioa of the rule on that subject.

Northern District of Illinois.

Mr. Thomas Dent and Mrt. Edwin -. Abbot for the plaintiff
in error.
lIr. Jeremialr S. Black and Hr. 11 K. Whiton, for the defendants in error.
Mn. JusTICE MILLBa delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff in error, who was defendant in the Circuit
Court, is a corporation organized under the laws of Wisconsin.
It had undertaken to build the whole or a large part of the
Wisconsin Central Railroad, and had made contracts with the
defendants in error, whom we shall hereafter call plaintiffs,
as they were in the Circuit Court, for the construction of a
part of this road. These contracts were drawn with the
minuteness of detail usual in such cases, and provided, among
other things, that payments should be made by defendant, as
the work progressed, on estimates made monthly by the engineer of the railroad company, on the fifteenth day of each
month, for all the work done the previous month, except fifteen
per cent retained by defendant as security for performance on
the part of plaintiffs until the work was completed.
The plaintiffs brought their action of covenant on these
contracts, alleging that they had commenced the work in the
month of July, 1872, shortly after the contracts were signed,

648

PHILLIPS, ETC. CONST. CO. V. SEYMOUR ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

and prosecuted it vigorously until some time in December;
that defendant had failed to pay the large sums due by the
estimates for work done in October and November; and,
seeing no prospect of payments, plaintiffs were compelled to
abandon the work, and bring this suit. They assert a claim
for all the work done as estimated, and for various items of
damage suffered by them in consequence of this failure of defendant to comply with its covenant to pay as agreed.
A demurrer to this declaration having been overruled, defendant filed fifteen pleas in bar; also an amended plea; and,
on these, numerous issues of fact were finally joined.
A verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of plaintiffs
for $119,061.46; to reverse which this writ of error is brought.
In this court, plaintiff in error, by one counsel, files fortyfive assignments of error, and by another seven more; making
fifty-two in all.
The object of the rule requiring an assignment of errors is
to enable the court and opposing counsel to see on what points
the plaintiff's counsel intend to ask a reversal of the judgment, and to limit the discussion to those points. This practice of unlimited assignments is a perversion of the rule,
defeating all its purposes, bewildering the counsel of the other
side, and leaving the court to gather from a brief, often as prolix as the assignments of error, which of the latter are really
relied on. We can only try to respond to such points made by
counsel as seem to be material to the judgment which we must
render.
Before we proceed to this examination, however, it may be
as well to say, that, in addition to a general verdict in favor of
plaintiffs for 8107,353.44, the jury made three special findings
on matters suggested by the court. These are, 1. That, at the time of the alleged breach of covenant by
defendant, it had waived or excused the failure of plaintiffs up
to that time to complete certain parts of their work within the
times stipulated in the contract; and that plaintiffs were, at the
time of said breach, engaged in the performance of said work,
with the consent of defendant.
2. That defendant, at the time plaintiffs stopped the work,
had given plaintiffs to understand that defendant was finan-

Oct. 1875.]

PmL~ups,

rc. CONST. Co. v. SEYmOUR ET AL.

649

cially unable to pay the estimates for work then done, and
would probably be unable for a time to pay future monthly
instalments.
3. That defendant had agreed to pay plaintiffs the extra cost
of doing the earth-work by train on certain sections, and that
the amount of this extra cost was $11,708.
These findings must be presumed to be in accordance with
the facts, and must stand as foundations for the judgment of
the court, unless it can be shown that they are affected by some
erroneous ruling of the court in regard to the admission of evidence or instructions to the jury.
We now proceed to notice such objections to the rulings of
the Circuit Court as we deem of sufficient importance to require it.
1. It is said that the declaration is fatally defective because
it does not aver that the plaintiffs were ready, willing, and able
to perform the covenants on their part to be performed by the
contract. It is true that this might have been alleged in more
formal and apt terms than it is. But they do aver, that, from
the time they entered upon the work in July until the fifteenth
day of December, - the day of the alleged breach on the part
of defendant, - they prosecuted the same with all the energy
and skill they possessed, having men in large numbers, -to
wit, more than 1,000,-with suitable teams and other equipments, along the whole line of the road of 160 miles; and that
defendant had expressed entire satisfaction with the manner in
which plaintiffs were doing the work.
We are inclined to think, that, coupled with the allegation
that defendant was in default for non-payment for work actually done, this was sufficient. It is not like a case where a
plaintiff has done nothing, but is required to put a defendant
in default by offering to perform, or showing a readiness to perform. Plaintiffs here had already performed, and the defendant failed to do its corresponding duty under the contract;
and, defendant having defaulted on a payment due, plaintiffs
are not required to go on at the hazard of further loss.
2. By the terms of the contract, plaintiffs bound themselves
to complete the first section, of forty miles, by the first day of
September; the third section, of twenty miles, by the fifteenth

650

PHILLIPS, ETC. CONST. Co. v. SEYMOUR ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

day of the same month; the fourth section, of twenty miles, by
the fifteenth day of November; and so on; and it is conceded
that no one of these sections was completed within the time
prescibed. It was also agreed, that if plaintiffs failed in this
respect, or failed in the opinion of the engineer-in-chief of the
railroad company to prosecute the work with sufficient vigor to
completion according to the terms of the contract, the defendant
might declare it abandoned, and the amount retained out of the
monthly estimates forfeited. This was fifteen per cent of each
monthly estimate, which, by the agreement, was retained by
defendant as security for the due progress of the work.
The main proposition, underlying the whole argument of the
defence on the general merits, is, that these covenants to complete certain sections within a definite time, and the covenant
to pay, are mutual and dependent covenants; and that time is
so far of the essence of this covenant of plaintiffs, that they can
recover nothing, because they completed nothing within the
specified time.
Where a specified thing is to be done by one party as the
consideration of the thing to be done by the other, it is undeniably the general rule that the covenants are mutual, and are
dependent, if they are to be performed at the same time; and
if, by the terms or nature of the contract, one is first to be performed as the condition of the obligation of the other, that
which is first to be performed must be done, or tendered, before
that party can sustain a suit against the other. There is no
doubt, that in this class of contracts, if a day is fixed for performance, the party whose duty it is to perform or tender performance first must do it on that day, or show his readiness
and willingness to do it, or he cannot recover in an action at
law for non-performance by the other party.
But, both at common law and in chancery, there are exceptions to this rule, growing out of the nature of the thing to be
done and the conduct of the parties. The familiar case of part
performance, possession, &c., in chancery, where time is not of
the essence of the contract, or has been waived by the acquiescence of the party, is an example of the latter; and the case
of contracts for building houses, railroads, or other large and
expensive ccnstructions, in which the means of the builder and

Oct. 1875.] PnLPS, ETC. CONST. Co. v. SEYmOUR

T AT.

651

his labor become combined and affixed to the soil, or mixed
with materials and money of the owner, often afford examples
at law.
If A. contract to deliver a horse to B. on Monday next, for
which B. agrees to pay $100, A. cannot recover by an offer to
deliver on Tuesday; but if A. agree to deliver a horse, buggy,
and harness on Monday, and B. accepts delivery of the horse
and buggy, can he refuse to pay any thing, though he accepts
delivery of the harness on Tuesday? This is absurd. He
waives, by this acceptance, the point of time as to the harness,
at least so far as A.'s right to recover the agreed sum is concerned. If B. have suffered any damage by the delay, he can
recover it by an action on A.'s covenant to deliver on Monday;
or, if he wait to be sued, he may recoup by setting it up in that
action as a cross-demand growing out of the same contract.
Such we understand to be especially the law applicable to
building contracts.
If the builder has done a large and valuable part of the
work, but yet has failed to complete the whole or any specific
part of the building or structure within the time limited by his
covenant, the other party, when that time arrives, has the option of abandoning the contract for such failure, or of permitting the party in default to go on. If he abandons the contract
and notifies the other party, the failing contractor cannot recover
on the covenant, because he cannot make or prove the necessary allegation of performance on his own part. What remedy
he may have in assumpsit for work and labor done, materials
furnished, &c., we need not inquire here ; but if the other
party says to him, "I prefer you should finish your work," or
should impliedly say so by standing by and permitting it to be
done, then he so far waives absolute performance as to consent
to be liable on his covenant for the contract price of the work
when completed.
For the injury done to him by the broken covenant of the
other side, he may recover in a suit on the contract to perform
within time; or, if he wait to be sued, he may recoup the damages thus sustained in reduction of the sum due by contract
price for the completed work.
It is said on the other side in this case, that the right of the

652

PHILLIPS, ETC. CONST. CO. V. SEYMOUR ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

defendant to abandon the contract, and retain in its hands the
fifteen per cent, is its only remedy, and that that has been
waived. We need not decide this point here; for we are only
answering the argument that plaintiffs have lost all right to
sue on the contract by their failure to complete the sections in
the times named.
As it is perfectly clear from the testimony that defendant,
at the time these several sections should have been completed,
made no point of the failure to do so, but urged the plaintiffs
to go on, expressed satisfaction at the manner in which the
work was progressing, and paid the estimate after such failure,
the verdict of the jury, that defendant had waived strict performance as to time, was so far well founded as to enable plaintiffs to recover for work actually done.
3. This is an appropriate place to dispose of another objection. Defendant set up in its pleas and offered evidence to
prove the damage sustained by those delays.
But the court instructed the jury, that, under this covenant,
time was not of the essence of the contract; that on that point
it was flexible, and defendant could not recover for the delay.
As we have stated above, we are inclined to the opinion that
defendant did not, by any of the acts proved in this case, waive
its right to damages arising from this failure of the plaintiffs to
complete the sections in time, but only waived the forfeiture,
if it may be so called, of all right on the part of plaintiffs to
sue. But an attentive examination of the testimony offered,
and of the charge of the court on that subject, shows that no
legal evidence of any damage was offered.
The attempt was to show, that, by the use of the road at an
earlier day, much profit would have resulted. But the witness
stated that the road ran through a wild, uninhabited country;
that he expected that saw-mills would have been established
along the line of the road, and the transportation of lumber
incident to the use of such mills would have made the defendant a profit of $20,000.
The whole basis of this calculation is conjectural, uncertain,
and vague. It is manifestly no safe basis on which it can be
assumed that any business would have been done in the few
days of the delay; or that, if done, it would have been done at

Oct. 1875.] PHILLIPS, ETC. CONST. Co. v. SEYMOUR ET ALi.

658

a profit. There was nothing on which a jury could have done
any thing but conjecture and speculate, at the hazard of sacrificing truth and justice.
There was, therefore, no error to defendant's prejudice in
this part of the case.
4. It is said that the court erred in admitting evidence on the
part of plaintiffs of the profits they would have made on the
remaining part of the road if defendant had paid, so that they
could go on.
Whether the evidence which was given on this subject was
admissible or not was rendered immaterial by the subsequent
ruling of the judge, who instructed the jury to disregard it,
and to allow plaintiffs nothing on the ground of such supposed
profits; and it is manifest from the record that nothing was
allowed for this in the verdict.
5. The foregoing are the material objections, which are of a
general character, to the rulings of the court. The items for
which the general verdict ($107,853.44) was had may be divided
into three classes :I. An agreed sum of $15,000, which was to be paid on the
completion of the first sixty miles of the road by the terms of
the contract, and which was exclusive of the estimates for work
done. Defendant resisted this, on the ground that plaintiffs,
not having finished the sixty miles, could not recover it in this
action, and also because they had abandoned the work.
In the view we have already expressed, neither of these
objections is sound. If, by defendant's breach, plaintiffs were
justified in abandoning the work, then they were entitled to all
they had earned under that contract, including the $15,000;
because the $30,000, of which this $15,000 was part, was a
liquidated sum agreed upon as compensation for extra work on
the first forty miles of the road which had been completed, and
was only withheld, like the fifteen per cent, as security for the
future performance by plaintiffs.
Defendant, having by its default terminated the work, had
no longer any right to retain either of these sums.
II. The next class consisted of the estimates under the contract,
which were unpaid. This is byfar the largest item of the verdict;
and no serious contest is made except as to $19,937.55, which
constituted the reserved fifteen per cent already mentioned.

63,4 PHILLIPS,

ETC. CONST.

CO.

v. SEYMOUR ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

As in the case of the $15,000, we are of opinion, that since
the work was abandoned, and the contract, by reason of the
breach thereof by the defendant, ended, it can have no right to
retain any part of the estimates for work actually performed.
This was to be retained as a security against failure or default
of plaintiffs, and cannot be held by defendant after its own
default has caused the abandonment of the work.
III. The third class is composed of a large number of items
of damages incidental to the abrupt cessation of the work by
reason of defendant's failure to pay,-such as loss of material,
supply road, shanties, travel of hands, depreciation in value of
tools, materials, &c. We cannot go into all these. After
mature consideration of the very full briefs and arguments on
these matters, we see no error in any ruling of the court in
regard to them, and so dismiss their further consideration.
6. A more difficult point remains to be considered.
The plaintiffs were allowed to introduce evidence to prove
that the defendant had made a verbal promise to pay the extra
cost of doing by train the earth-work of the sections between 40
and 46; and the jury found a special and separate verdict, that
it had so promised, and that this extra cost was $11,708.
There is no allegation of this promise in the declaration,
which is an action of covenant on the sealed agreement. There
is no allusion to it, or provision for it, in that instrument. It is
found by the special verdict to be a promise, and the record
shows that it was by parol. Defendant objected to the admission of the evidence of this contract, on the specific ground, that,
if valid, it could be enforced in assumpsit only, and not in an
action founded solely on the specialty.
The work done under the written contract could be estimated
by the engineer, because a price was fixed by it for every thing.
le had only to ascertain quantities, apply the prices, and ascertain the amount to be paid. For this extra cost of a special
mode of doing part of the work, he had no elements out of
which to make an estimate.
It is certainly opposed to the common-law system of pleading
which prevails in the Illinois circuit, - to join the actions of covenant and assumpsit. If this had been done in the declaration,
the defendant could have successfully demurred.

Oct. 1875.] PHILLIPS, ETC. CONST. Co. v. SEYMOUR ET AL.

655

It is equally clear that covenant cannot be sustained on a
verbal promise. Can the plaintiffs be allowed to prove a cause
of action, which, if alleged in the declaration, would have been
fatal to it on demurrer ? and can they recover in an action of
covenant on a special parol promise?
The judge below said he would not hazard the general verdict
by permitting this matter to be embraced in it. He took the
special verdict, and, notwithstanding his doubts, embraced the
amount of it in the final judgment.
This matter grows immediately out of, and is intimately
connected with, the work done under the written contract. It
is merely a verbal agreement, that if the plaintiffs would do the
work in a manner different from their obligation, more advantageous to defendant, and more expensive, defendant would pay
this difference in expense. It seems reasonable that the claim
for this extra cost should be decided in the suit in which the
other compensation for the same work is recovered; that
plaintiffs, having proved their case and recovered a verdict,
should not be compelled to resort to a new suit in which this
verdict would stand for nothing. Only a rule of pleading
stands in the way, in this court, of doing what the very right of
the case requires. We can give the plaintiffs their judgment
for the amount of the general verdict, and reject this; or we can
do complete justice, and affirm the judgment of the Circuit
Court in full.
But the State of Illinois has adhered to the system of pleading which recognizes the lines that separate the forms of
action at common law, and the act of Congress requires the
Circuit Courts to conform to the mode of pleading of the State
in which the court sits. Undoubtedly there was error under
that system in admitting proof of a parol contract of this kind
in an action of covenant; and as the defendant made this
precise objection, and took an exception when overruled, we do
not see how we can refuse to give it the benefit of its objection.
In those States where the distinction between forms of action
have been abolished, the declaration could have been amended,
and the two matters joined in the same action. In that case,
we might, under the statute of jeofails, disregard the error as
one capable of removal by amendment below, and as cured by
verdict and judgment when it comes here.

But sect. 954 of the Revised Statutes, which was sect.

There is no room here for amendment. There could have

which is responsive to no issue made by the pleadings, or which
could have been made by any pleading in that action, is farther
than we can go in the promotion of abstract justice.
The judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, with
direction to the court below to set aside the special verdict of
the jury for the $11,708, and to enter a judgment in favor of
plaintiffs on the general verdict of $107,353.44, with interest
from the day it was rendered; and the plaintiff in error is to
recover costs in this court.
If, however, the defendants in error shall within a reasonable
time, during the present term of this court, file in the Circuit
