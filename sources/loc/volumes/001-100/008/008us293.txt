If these principles be'c6rrect, it remains to inquire Hunon A:-

whether the brig Sea Flower remained in the possession
and in the powei of the sovereign of the captor after be-

ing. carried into a Spanish port.
Had this been a prize of war, we have precedents and
principles which'would guide us. The cases cited from
Robinson's Reports, and the regulations made by Louis
XVI. in November, 1779, show that the practiceof condemning prizes of war while lying in neutral ports has
prevailed in-England, and has been adopted in France.
The objections to this practice may perhaps b'e sufficient
to induce nations to change it by common consent, but
until they change it the practice must be submitted to,
and the sentence of condemnation passed under such circumstances will bind-the property, unless the legislature
of thecountry in which the capturedvessel may be claimed, or the law of nations, shall otherwise direct.
The sovereign whose officer has in his name captured
a vessel as prize of war, remains in possession of that
vessel, and has full power oier her, so long as she is in
a situation in which that possession cannot be rightfully
divested. The fact whether she is an enemy vesset or
not ought however to be judicially inquired into and decided, ani therefore the property In a neutral captured
as an enemy is never changed until sentence of condemnation has passed; and the practice of nations reqtures
that the vessel shall be in a place of safety before such
sentepce can be rendered. In the port of a neutral she
is in a place of safety, and the possession of the captor
cannot be lawfully divested, because ilie neutral "sovereign, by himself or by his courts, can take no cognizance of the question of prize or no prize. .Thisplsition is not intended to apply to the case of a sovereign
bound by particular treaties to one of the belligerents;
it is intended to apply only to those neutrals who are free
to act according to the general law of nations. In such
case theneutral sovereign cannot wrest from the possession of the captor a prize of war brought into his ports,

is objected that his courts can take no jurisdiction
of a vesselunder such circumstances, because they cannot enforce a sentence of restitution.

SIt

But it is' to be rdccllected that the possession of the
captor is in principle the libssession of his sovereign; he
is commissioned to seize in the name of the sovereign,
and is as much an officer appointed for that purpose, as
one who irL the body of a county serves a civil process.
lIe is'under the controul and direction of the sovereign,
and must be considered as ready to obey his commands
legally communicated through his courts.
It is true'that in point of fact cruisers are often commanded by men whodo not feel a due respect for the
laws, and who are not of sufficientresponsibility to compensate the injuries their improper conduct may occasion; but in principle they must be considered as officers
commissioned by their sovereign to make'a seizure in the
particular case, and to be ready to obey the legitimate
mandate of the sovereign directing a restitution
The
property therefore may be restored while lying in a neutral-port, and whether it may or 'may not be sold in the
neutralport, the condemnation without h sale may change
the property, if such condr ination be valid.
In cases of prize of war, then, the difficulty of execu-ling the sentence does not seem to afford any conclusive
argument against the jurisdiction of the court of the capto'r over a vessel in possession of the captor, but lying
in a neutral or friendly port.
Do the same principles ap Ay to a seizure made within
the territory of a state for the violation of its municipal
-laws?
In t.e solution of this question the court can derive
no aid from precedent. The case erhaps has only occurred ii the wars which have been carried on singe the
year 1793, and the court in deciding it finds' itself' re4uced to the necessity of reasoning from analogy,

possession, .wuymmJ
when carried into a foreign port, is still in tiis
and he is-as capable of restoring it if the offence should
n6t have been committed, as he is of restoring a neutral
vessel unjustly captured as an enemy. The sentence in
the one case maybe executed with as much facility as in
the other.
Pcssession of the re-s by the sovereign has been considered as giving the jurisdiction to his court; the particular mode of introducing the subject into the court, or, in
other ivords, of instituting the particular process which
is prelimainary to the sentence, is properly of municipal
re~ulation, uncontrouled by the law of nations, and therefore is not examinable by.a foreign tribunal. It would
seem then that the principles which have been stated as
applicable in this respect to a prize of war, may be applied to a vessel rightfully seized for violating the municipal laws of a nation, if the sovereign of the captor
possesses the same right to maintain his possession
against the claim of the original owner in the latter as in
the former'case. If, on a libel filed by the original
owner in the courts of the country into which the vessel
might be brought, the possession could be defended by
alleging that she was seized for the violation of a niunicipal law, and the right of the court to decide the cause
would be thereby defeated, then that possession would
seem to be stifficiently firm to maintain the jurisdiction
of the courts of the captor.
Upon this point much doubt has been entertained. It
is,
however, the opinion of a majority of the judges, tat
a possession thus lawfully acquired under the authority
of a sovereign state could not be. divested by the tribunals of that country into whose ports the captured vessel
was brought; at least that it could not be divested un-.
less there should be such obvious delpy in proceeding to
a condemnation as would justify the opinion that no sch
measure was intended, and thus convert the seizure into
a trespass.
. The judgment ot the circuit court is- to be reversed.
