The Chief yustice stated that there had been some
difference of opinion among the judges, which arose
from their not understanding perfectly the facts of the
case.
If the writ of error had been served when it .as not
in force, (that is, after its return day,) such service would
have been void. But if served while in force, a return
afterwards will be good.
The service or a writ of error is the lodging a copy
thereof for the adverse party in the office of the clerk of
the court where the judgment was rendered. 1 vol. Laws

If it be so served before the return day, the service is
good.
In the case cited from 4 Dal. it.does not appear which
party made the motion, nor whether there was qn appearance for the iopposite party.
In the present case, the writ of error having been
served when in full force, and the writ of error returtied, although not at the first term, the appearance of the
defendant in error has waived all objection to the irregularity of the return.
The judgment iwas affirmed.
