the right to resort to the underwriters for a total lose,
which was given by the abandonment.

This point has never been decided in the courts of

England.

In the case of Hamilton v. Menaez, Lord Mansfield
leaves it completely undeterniined, whether the state of
loss at the time the abandonment is made, or at the

time of action brought, or at the time of the verdict
rendered, shall fix the right to recover for a partial or a
total loss.
A majority of the judges are of opinion that the httite
of loss at the time of the abandonment must fix the rights
of the parties to recover on an action afterwards
brought; and the judge who doubts respecting it, is of
opinion that, in this case, counter security having been
refused by the underwriters, the question of freight is
yet suspendeid.
It is to be certified to the circuit court of Pennsylvantla, that in the case stated for the. opinion of this
court, the. plaintiff is entitled to recover for a total
loss.
