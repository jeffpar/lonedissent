Cross et al. v. Harrison.

ALEXANDER CROSS, WILLIAM L. HOBSON, AD WILLIAMr HoopER, TRADING UNDER THE NAME AND STYLE OF CROSS, HoBsoN,
& COMPANY, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR, v. E wARI H. HARRISON.
In the war with Mexico, tite port of San Francisco was co nquered by the arms of the
United States, in the year 1346, and shortly afterwards the United States had military possession of all of Upper California. Early in 1847 the President of the United States, as constitutional commander-in-chief of the army and navy, authorized
the military and naval commanders of the United States forces in Caifornia to exercise the 1elligerent rights of a conqueror, and to form i. civil and military government for the conquered territory, with power to impose duties on imports and tonnage for the support of such government, and of the army, which had the conqucst
in possession.
This was done, and tonnage and import duties were levied under a war tariff, which
had been established by the civil government for that purpose, until official notice
was received by the civil and military Governor of California, that a treaty of
peace had been made with Mexico, by which Upper California had been ceded to
the United States.
Upon receiving this intelligence thd governor directed that import and tonnage duties
should thereafter be levied in ponformity with such as were to be paid in the other
ports of the United States, by the acts of Congress; atd for such purpose he appointed the defendant in this suit, collector of. the port of San Francisco.
The plaintiffs now seek to recover from him certain tonnage duties and imposts
upon foreign merchandise paid by them to the defendant as collector between the
the 13th of November,
tnd
3d of Febrnar-y, 1848, (the date of the treaty of peace,)

upon the

that they

President,

1849, E8e
(when

colector
illegally
exacted.
The formation of the civil government in California, when it was done, was the lawful exercise of a belligerent right over a conquered territory. It was the existing
government when the territory"was eeded to the United States, as a conquest, and
did not cease as a matter of course, or as a consequence of the restoration of peace;
and it was rightfully continued after peace was made with Mexico, until Congress
legislated otherwise, under its constitutional power, to dis -ose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or othef property belonging to the
United States.
The tonnage duties, and duties upon foreign goods imported into San Francisco,
were legally demanded and lawfully collected by the civ I governor, whilst the war
continued, and afterwards, from the ratification of the teeaty of peace until the revenue system of the United States was put into practical operation in California,,
under the acts of Congress, passed for that purpose.

THIS case came up, by writ of error, frora the Circuit Court
of the United States, for the Southern District of New York.
Cross, Hobson, & Co., brought an action of assumpsit to recover back from Harrison, moneys paid to him while acting as collector of customs at the port of San Francisco, in California, for
tonnage on vessels and duties on merchandis3, not of the growth,
produce, or manufacture of the United Staies, imported by the
plaintiffs from foreign places into California, and there landed,
between February 3, 1848, and November 12, 1849.
The plea was non assumpsit, and the verdict and judgment
were for Harrison, in January, 1852.
The bill of exceptions contained the substance of much testi-

mony offered by the plaintiff, (which it is not necessary to recite,)
and also the whole of the Senate Document, No. 18, of the first
session of the thirty-first Congress. The opinion of the court
contains a statement of the material parts of this evidence.
The case was argued by Milr. Richard T. ierrick and Mr.

.Tanzes W. 11c Cullok, upon a brief filed by himself and Mr. Tohn

S. Mc Cullok, for the plaintiffs in error, upon -which side there was
also filed a brief by l1r. Rockwell and 3i1r. Lawrevre; and by
.Mr. Cashing, (Attorney-General,) for the defendant in error.
The briefs on both sides were so elaborate that only a portion
of each can be inserted; and those parts are selected which relate to the legality of continuing, after the peace, the govern.
ment which had been established during the war.
The points for the plaintiffs in error, as stated by the Messrs.
Ilc Cullok, were the following points:
1st. That on foreign goods or vessels brought into California,
between the 3d of February, 1848, and the 3d of March, 1849,
and between the 3d of March, 1849, and the 12th of November,
1849, duties did not accrue to the United States, and their exdction was therefore illegaL
2d. That on foreign goods and vessels brought into 'alifornia between the 3d of February, 1848, and the 12th of Novem:
ber, 1849, the defendant had no authority by any treaty or law
of the United States to collect duties, and their exaction was
therefore illegal.
3d. Between the 3d of February, 1848, and the 12th of November, 1849, the defendant was not authorized, by any law of the
United States, to require the plaintiffs to go with or send to a
port within a collection district of the United States, foreign
goods and vessels, and there pay duties, before the plaintiffs
should bring the same into California; nor to put plaintiffs toelect between so doing and the paying of duties to the defendant.

4th. That after the 23d of February, 1849, when the plaintiffs
protested against the exactions made, or to be made, the defendant was not justified in paying over the moneys theretofore or
thereafter exacted to the use of the United States, or any other
person.
5th. That the plaintiffs are entitled to the customary interest of California, on all sums exacted by defendant by duress,
and against protest, on goods and vessels brought into California
between the 3d February, 1848, and the 12th of November, 1849.
6th. That on the whole evidence, no part of the duties
claimed were paid voluntarily, but each and every of them were
exacted by compulsion and duress.

SUPREME

COURT.

Cross et al. v. Harrisor.

Under the foregoing points, the plaintiffs in error will rely
upon the following authorities:
Ist. Between the 3d of February, 1848, and the 12th of November, 1849, duties did not accrue to the United States in
California.
(a.) The wisdom, goodness, and power necessary for the protection of the general welfare and peace cf the people, are the
only source from which is derived the authority to exercise the
sovereignty of the nation. I Burlamaqui Nat. Law, c. 9, pp. 83,
89. And on these the power to reward and punish rests.
Id. 93. The powers which the sovereign exercises, are those
which relate to internal administration. 2 Burlamaqui, Pt. 3,
c. 1, p. 152. And next, those which regulate foreign or external administrations. 2 Id. Pt. 4, c. 1, p. 220. Among this
last class are the powers of making offensive or defensive war,
of concluding treaties and alliances, of controlling the immigration of foreigners, and of regulating commerce. By the
laws of war, the sovereign acquires the right to spoil, plunder,
and destroy the goods of lis enemy, and possess his lands. 2
Burlamaqui, Pt. 4, c. 7, p. 290, &c.. In order to indemnify for
the expenses of war out of his enemies' goods and lands, and
while the conqueror continues in possession of the lands, he is
sovere.ign over them, and of all within them; and may either
admit the vanquished, to the rights of subjects, or banish them
as enemies from the country, for the sovereignty thus acquired
is absolute. 2 Burlamaqui,' Pt. 4, c. 8, § 12, p. 309. And
from these rights of war flows the sovereign power of maling
treaties, equal or unequal, (2 Burlamaqui, Pt. 4, c. 9, pp. 314,
317, 319,) and.whether in war or in peace-- such treaties being
unequal whenever they limit the powers of the foreign sovereign; as by stipulating that the conqueror's consent shall be
had before the foreign sovereign can act in any given way. Id.
§ 13, p, 319.
The power to regulate foreign commerce necessarily includes,
as one of its incidents, the power to lay imposts on foreign
goods, or even to prohibit them entry, (VattA'sr Law of Nations,
Bk. 1, c. 8, pt 39,) whenever the welfare of the State demands
it: The right to trade with a foreign nation is therefore
conventional, and the treaty-that cedes the right is the measure
or limit thereof- dependent on the will of tbe foreign sovereign,
and not a right of prescription. And a foreign nation may
limit its foreign trade to itself, or to its own vessels, by treaty
or otherwise. Vattel, Bk. 2, c. 2, p. 121.
During the flame of war, a nation may sell or abandon part
of its public property, (Vattel, Bk. 1, c. 21, p. 105,) though,
if the sovereign be not absolute, this may require the concurrence

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

of his coordinates, the people. The empire or sovereignty, and
the domain or property, are not inseparable- for the nation
may have its sovereignty but not its domain
which may be
held in the possession of a foreign nation, either by war or
treaty. Vattel, Bk. 1, c. 23, p. 118.
(b.) The sovereign -vho acquires a country by conquest or
treaty, has the exclusive right to legislate in regard to it, and
may impart this right to another; and the country so acquired
may be retained in a subject condition, or be erected into a
colony.
The laws of the conquered or ceded country remain, until
changed by the sovereign conqueror, who may change the political form of government; but the laws of trade remain. Dvarr.
on Stat. 907;Nall v. Campbell, Cowp. Rep. 204; Calvin's Case,
7 Rep. 176. And where the power to legislate therein has
been granted by charter or statute to another, there the laws of
the conqueror do not extend, into such territories. Dwarris,
526, 527; 3 and 4 William 4, c. 93, relating to Governor and
Council of India.
But where the country is acquired by the right of occupancy
and discovery, and peopled by the subjects of the sovereign
who makes the discovery, the colonists carry with them such
laws of their sovereign as may be applicable to their condition.
Dwarr. on Stat. 905; Attorney-General v. Stuart, 2 Meriv. Rep.
143.
All laws, beneficial to such colonies, go with the colonists;
but penal laws, inflicting forfeitures and disabilities, never extend to colonies not in esse, (Dawes v. Painter, Freeman, 175;
Dwarris, 527,) nor do laws of tithes, bankruptcy, mortmain, or
police.
The laws of the sovereign, passed after the settlement of a
country, whether ceded, conquered, or discovered, do not affect
such colony unless specifically named; or, unless they relate to
the exercise of the fo'eign powers of the sovereign, in regard to
navigation, trade, revenue, and slipping. Dwarr. on Statutes,
527, 906; 1st Report of Commr's 'West Indies, Legal Inquiry, 2, 6; Parl. in Ireland, 12th Rep. 112.
Thus we find that, after the discovery of the North American
Colonies, till the Revolution, Great Britain reglated the foreign
trade of these her colonies, by various acts of parliament, passed
to linit it to the vessels of British subjects and to British ports,
and to encourage it. She controlled the tobacco trade by
statutes - (1670, 22 and "23 Car. 2, c. 26; 1685, 1 James 2,
c. 4; 1695, 7 Villiam 3, c. 10; 1699, 10 and 11 'William 3,
c. 21; 1704, 3 and 4 Anne, c. 5; 1709, 8 Ane, c. 13; 1713,
12 Alne, c. 8.) She restrained all imports and exports to and
-

from A'crica to British ports and British ships - (12 Car. 2,
c. 12, .§§ 1,.2, 3, 4, 19; 7 and 8 Wm.3, c. 22, § 13; 8 Anne,
c. 13, § 23 ; The Recovery, 6 Robinson, 34C; Wilson v. Marriatt,
8 T. R. 31; 1 Bos. & Pull. 432; 2 Evans's British Statutes, 51;
15 Car. 2, c. 7; 2 Evans's Stats. 58, 62; Grant v. Lloyd, 4
Taunt. 136.) She regulated the import of prize goods into and
from America, - (1711, 10 Anne, c. 22; 1742, 15 George 2,
c. 31; and, 1744, 17 George 2, c. 34.) She encouraged and
controlled all the trade to her colonies, by statutes - (1695,7
William 3, c. 22; 1707, 6 Anne, c. 37; 1710, 8 Anne, c. 27;
1733, 6 George 2, c. 13; 1740, 13 Gebrge 2, c. 31.) She
forbade exports from her colonies to certai;a foreign countries(1731, 4 George 2, c. 15; 1732, 5 George 2, c. 22; 1767, 30
George 2, c. 9.) She regulated the import of coffee, tea, and
other goods into these colonies; appointed commissioners of
the revenue, and provided penalties for the violations of such
laws - (1763, 4 George 3, c. 15; 1765, 5 3eorge 3, c. 45;
1766, 6 George 3, c. 49 and 52; 1767, 7 George 3, c. 41, 46,
56; 1768, 8 George 3, c. 22; 1772, 12 George 3, c. 7 and 60;
1773, 13 George 3, c.44.) And following up her legislation in
regard to these colonies, Great Britain in 1772, (12 George 3,
c. 60,) allowed a drawback on tea, exported to her British North
American Colonies; and, until the Revolution, entirely co ntrolled
the trade and duties laid in the colonies. Journals of Congress,
Vol. 1, pp. 27, 31, 33 to 39, 47, 394 to 393; Gales & Seaton's
Debates in Congress, 216.
The oppression of these laws of Great Britain upon her colonies having resulted in the destruction at Boston, on the 31st
December, 1773, of teas imported there by the East India Company, on which they had paid duties; in the meeting of the
Congress of the Colonies on the 5th of September, 1774, at Philadelphia ; in Great Britain's denouncing them out of her protection
on the 20th of December, 1775; in the Declaration of Independence of 4th of July, 1776 ; in the acknowledgment of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, on 30th November,
1782; and in the Treaty of Peace, signed at Paris on the 2d of
September, 1783,- the United States became independent and
absolute sovereignties.
(c.) From the 2d of September, 1783, until the adoption of the
Constitution by the States, respectively, each had, and sevpral
of them exercised, the power of regulating its foreign commerce,
and laying imposts and tonnage duties. Journals of Congress
of the Confederation, Vol. 2, 298, 301; Gales & Seaton's History of Debates in Congress, 111. Georgia laid Is. 8d. sterling
on tonnage; and South Carolina laid Is. 3 d. sterling, (id. 300);
Pennsylvania laid .a tonnage on vessels of nations in treaty;

DECE-MBER

TERMI, 1853.

Cross et al. v. Harrison.

Maryland laid is. 8d. per ton on vessels in treaty, and 2s. 8d.
on others, except British, which paid 6s. 8d. and two per cent.
on goods therein; Virginia laid a tonnage of 3s. 6d. on vessels
in treaty, and 6s. 6d. on non-treaty vessels, and two per cent.
ad valorem on goods therein; and South Carolina laid 2s. 9d.
sterling on British sugars, and Is. 8d. on those of other nations.Id. 275.
By the Confederation of 17th November, 1777, the States
still reserved to themselves the right to regulate their foreign
commerce, and to lay duties. See article 6th, vol. 2, Journals of
Congress of the Confederation, 298, .001, 830. There were,
however, secured to the citizens of different States certain rights
by the Confederation in regard to imports and exports of gooas
from State to State. Arts. 4, 6, 2 volume Journals of Confe&-ration, 380.
It is true'that the Congress of the Confederation, on the 22"1
September, 1774, (see Journal of Congress, vol. 1, 14,) requested
the merchants and others in fie colonies to recall all orders for
goods from Great Britain, and on the 27th September, 1774,
(id. vol. 1, 15,) resolved, that after 1st December, 1774, there
should be no importation of goods from Great Britain or Ireland, nor purchase of goods if imported thence; and that on
20th October, 1774, (id. vol. 1, 23 to 26C) the non-inportation,
non-consumption, and non-e~portation agreement was signed
by the members of Congress, yet the Congress did not, in fact,
execute these resolves; and on 6th April, 1776, (id. vol. 1, 3078,) a resolve was passed allowing importations and exportatil ws
to the citizens of the colonies, and of all nations, except to and
from those under the dominion of Great Britain, subject to the
duties laid or to be laid by the colonies.
Yet, before the Revolution, a commercial combination reg-a
lated the importations between America and Great Britain. If
any man was suspected of an infraction of the non-importation
agreement, his conduct was strictly watched, and if his guilt
was discovered he was published and held up to the world as
an enemy to his country. Gales & Senton's History of Debates
in Congress, vol. 1, 320, speech of Mr. White.
The means to defray the expenses of govtzrnnent, under the
Confederation, for common defence and general welfare, were
obtained by requisitions on the several States, for such sums of
money as should be in proportion to the value of the lands and
improvements ir. possession, or in grant to the citizens of the
State, (Journals of Congress of Confederation, 'October,14th,
1777, vol. 2, 288,) to be estimated in such way as Congress
should appoint. See Confederation, artiele 8, vol. 2, Journal of
Congress, 330, November 15th, 1777. These quota Were fixed

by Congress, from time to time, according to the number of the
white. inhabitants in each State. Art. 9, Confederation; see
vol. 2 of Journals of Confederation, 336, 3237; also id. 346, November 23d, 1777, and the Report of the Committee of the Board
of Treasury, id. 332.
From these authorities it Nill appear that the States, individually, regulated their foreign commerce and duties, and were
in this respect foreign sovereigns to each other, and they maintained this relation until the adoption of the Constitution of
the United States. Thus we find that by the 7th article of the
Constifution, the ratification thereof by thb conventions of nine
of the original thirteen States was to be sufficient for the establisl-ment of the Constitution, and that. on 26th July, 1788,
eleven of the thirteen had adopted it, and that North Carolina
and Rhode Island stood aloof; the first until 2d November, 1789,
and I he last till 29th May,'1700. See Mr. Hickey's Book, published in 1847, p. 24.
Between the 26th July, 1788, and 29th May, 1790, Rhode
Island was therefore in the position of a foreign State, regulating her own commerce, and laying her own duties, and she
did not send deputies to the convention at Philadelphia to
form a Constitution. See Gales & Seaton's History of Debates
in Congress from 1789 to 1791, vol. 1, p. 4 of Introduction.
Rhode Island was thus in a position to force British goods into
the United States, by Long Island and Connecticut. Id. p. 124,
Mr. Boudinot's speech. She did, in fact, enter into the neighboring States linen and barley that had not paid duty to the
United States. Id. p. 164.
(d.) The position of North Carolina and of Rhode Island
was that of foreign States, as to the United States, and they
were so treated by the Congress of the United States, under
the Constitution. Thus (Gales & Seator's History of Debates
in Congress from 8d March, 1787, to 3d1 March, 1791, vol. 1,
pp. 1011, 1012,) a bill passed the Senate to prevent goods from
being brought from Rhode Island into the United States; and
(History of Congress from March 4, 1789, to March 31, 1793,
by Carey, Lea & Blanchard, p. 609, 2d sess. 1 Cong. Senate Journal, p. 134,) on .2Sth April, 1790, a committee -as appointed to
consider what provisions would be proper for Congress to make
respecting Rhode Island; and on 11th )lIay, 1790, their report
was considered, (same Journal, p. 13S, 139,) and a resolution
was passed, that all commercial intercour e betveen the United
States and Rhode Island from 1st July nxt be prohibited; and
on 13th May, 1790, the committee reported a bill for that purpose; on 14th May, it was ordered to a third reading, and on
-the 18th May, it was passed by the Senate, 13 ayes to 7 noes.

In the House, it passed first and second readings; and on 1st
June, 1790, the Flesident communicated, by a message to both
houses, that' Rhode Island had acceded to the Constitution.
See House Journal, p. 219, 232; also, Gales & Seaton's History of Debates in Congress, vol. 2, p. 1009, 11th May, 1790.
When Rhode Island came into the Union, acts of Congress
were passed to extend to this State, the laws of Congress relafive to the judiciary, the census, &c. vol. 1 Gales & Seaton's
History of Debates in Congress, pp. 1020, 1023, 1026; Id. 1711;
also, Id. 1006.
The State of Vermont was admitted by 1 Stat. at L. 191, c. 7,
February, 1791, and laws extended over her. by c. 12, March,
1791, 1 Stat. at L. 197, 198.
Rhode Island and North Carolina were, therefore, until they
adopted the Constitution of the United States, foreign to the
United States, and to the laws of Congress, and were outside
of all provisions in regard to commerce and duties, unless exressly named in the statutes of Congress. The General Colection Act of 31st July, 1789, c. 5, (1 Stat. at Large, p. 29,) by
section 1, establishes collection districts, in each of -the eleven
States that had adopted the Constitution; and by section
39, 1 L. U. S., 48, recites that North Carolina and Rhode
Island had not adopted the Constitution, and "lays duties on
goods not the produce of those States, when imported from
either of them into the United States." The act of 16th September, 1789, c. 16, (1 Stat. at L. 69,) section 2, gives to vessels of North Carolina and Rhode Island the same privileges,
when registered, as to vessels of the United States; section 3
lay.s on rum, loaf-sugar, and chocolate made in North Carolina
and Rhode Island, the same duties as when imported from other
foreign countries; neither North Carolina nor Rhode Island
were embraced in the acts of 23d September, 1789, c. 18,to
compensate the judges of the Supreme Court, (1 Stat. at L. 72,)
and of 24th September, 1789, c. 20, establishing the judiciary
of the United States, (1 Stat. at L. 73.) North Carolina was
bought within the revenue laws by the act 8th February, 1790,
§ 1, C. 1, (1 Stat. at L. 99); and the Judiciary Act was extended to North Carolina, 4th June, 1790, c. 17, (1 Stat. at L
And the second section of act of l6th September,

1789, was revived against Rhode Island by the first section of
the act of 8th of February, 1790, (1 Stat. at L. 100.) The
Census Act of the 1st March, 1790, c. 2, did not embrace her;
1 Stat. at L. 102. And on the 4th June, 1790, c. 19, (1 Stat. at L.

by reason thereof, the thirty-ninth section of the act 1789, c. 5,

23d June, 1790, c. 21, extended the Judiciary Act to Rhode
Island; and the law of 5th July, 1790, extended to her the
Census Act.
The power lodged' in the Congress of the United States by
Constitution, Art. 1, § 8, "to regulate commerce with foreign
nations," includes all power over navigation. Gibbons v. Ogden,
9 Wheat. 191; The North River Steamboat Company v. Livingston, 3 Cowen, R. 713; United States v. The Brigantine
William, 2 Hall's Law Journal, 265; 3 Story's Com. Const. 161;
1 Kent's Com. 405, Lec. 19. The power to regulate it "among
the several States" was demanded because, during the confederacy, the States had pursued a local and selfish policy, suicidal
in its tendency; and temporily sought to gain advantages over
one another in trade, by favors and rest'ictions. Federalist, No.
42, 1 Tuck. Black Com. App. 247 to 252; President Monroe's
Message, 4th May, 1822, pp. 31,32; 2 Story s Com. Const. § 1062,
p. 511. And the power to regulate it " wih:h the Indian tribes"
having been priorto the Revolution vestedin the British sovereign,
and having, at the Revolution, naturally flcwed, subject to some
restrictions, to the government under the confederacy, (Worcester
v. State of Georgia, 6 Pet. 615; Johnson v. McIntosh, 8 Wheat.
543,) was finally vested, unreservedly in the United States, under the Constitution. 2 Story's Com. Const. § 1094, p. 540, 541.
(e.) The power to admit new States und.er the Confederation
was limited to Canada (Art. 11) ; no other British colony was
to be admitted, except by consent of nine States. The Congress of the Confederation at length induced the States to cede
the Western Territory, (3 Story's Com. Const. 1311,) and the
ordinance of 13th July, 1787, as to this territory, is the model
hitherto used for our territorial governments. 3 Story's Com.
§ 1312; Webster's Speeches, January, 1830, pp. 360,-4. Missouri came into the Union by force of this ordinance, with a
limit of 360 30' N. lat. as that, by which all territories ceded by
France shall exclude slavery. Act of Congress, 6th March,
1820, 3d L. U. S. 548. See Green v. Biddlle, 8 Wheat. R. 1,
87, 88, as to the compact between Virginia and Kentucky. Now,
under the Constitution, (§ 3, art. 4i 3 Story's.tCom. Const. § 130S,
p. 184,) the United States have power to admit new States, and
their power can only be exercised by the Congress.
The power of Congress to admit new States does not include,
as its incident, any power to acquire new territory by treaty,
purchase, or otherwise, (the power to admit new States had reference only to the territory then belonging .o the United States,

cannot be justified as incident to the power of Congress as to
This purchase from
common defence and general welfare.
France, by tieaty of 1803, by which the United States were to
pay eleven millions of dollars and to admit the inhabitants
into the Union as soon as possible, was justified by President
Jefferson, on the ground of the necessity to protect the commerce of the West and have the passage of the Gulf, (President's
MIes--age, pp. 105, 106, &c., 17th October, 1803,) and the power
to make this purchase depends solely on its being an incident
of the national sovereign power of the United States, to make
war and conclude treaties, (4 Elliott's Debates, 2.57 to 260;
American Insurance Company v. Canter, 1 Pet. S. C. R. 511,
542, 5173; Story's Com. Const. § 1281,) and the United States
have incidentally the power to create corporations and territorial governments. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 409, 422,
3 Story's Com. Const. 132.
The power, then, of the United States to acquire new territory
does not depend upon any specific grant in the Constitution to
do so, but flows from its sovereignty over foreign commerce,
war, treaties, and imposts. 3 Story's Com. Cot/st. § 1281; 4 Elliott's Debates, 257-260; American Insurance Company v.
Canter, 1 Pet. 511-542, 517. The power of the United States
over conquered and ceded territory is sovereign, and exclusive
of State control or power, (3 Story's Com. Const. § 1251,

Territory acquired by the United States, by conquest or by
treaty, does not, by force of our Constitution, become entitled to
self-government, nor can it be subject to the jurisdiction of any
State. 3 Story's Com. Const. 1318. It would be without any

Godfrey, 17 Johns. R. 225; Commonwealth v. Young, 1 Hall's
Jour. of Jurisprudence, 47. The power of the United States
lodged in the Congress is supreme over all cessions, even from
the several States - and no State can lir.it, defeat, or modify
the action of the United States over such cessions, (Cohens v.
Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 424-8; Loughborough v. Blake, 5
Wheat. L.'322-4,) both as to the property and as to the inhabitants ; and the domain and sovereignty are distinct, and may
be one or both exercised or not; hence Ccngress may lay a direct tax on lands'in its ceded territories. 5 Wheat. 317. Congress may omit to extend a direct tax to the territories or districts
owned by her, whenever a direct tax is laid on the States. 5
Wheat. 817; 3 Story's Com. Const. § 996, p. 463. The words
of Art. 1 § 9, Constitution United States, do not require that
such tax shall eitend to the territories. 2 Story's Com. Const.
§ 1005, §,2, Art. 1, Const. regulates how a direct tax shall be apportioned among the States, but this does not require the territories to be taxed, although no State could be exempted.
(f.) These authorities show clearly that the domain and the
sovereignty of the United States always rust be distinct; and
may or may not be both in full exercise at once, as is ever the
case with all nations. The sovereignty of the United States is
operative in foreign countries - both in war and peace her
domain is local. In war, we taxed the goods brought into
Tampico, in Mexico, while in our military occupancy; and also
laid imposts on goods brought thence into tfAe collection districts
of the United States. Fleming v. Page, 9 Howard, S. C. I.
615-619. See Benner v. Porter, id. 235. I-a war, Great Britain,
by force of arms, occupied Castine, a port; within a collection
district of the United States, and foreign goods were there imported during such hostile occupancy: hence, upon the aban.
donment of that port by the foe, the United States had no right
to lay imposts on said goods, then and there found; because her
sovereignty was, as to that port, in her domain, suspended by
the hostile occhpancy. United States v. Rice, 4 Wheat. 246;

to confine its revenue laws to the States and Territories, at the

have passed two acts regulating the entering of merchandise
into the United States from foreign adjacent territories. See

(The argument upon the other points is omitted for want of
room.)
The brief of 1"1r. Gushing, (Attorney-General,) occupied thirty
printed pages. From it. there will be extracted so much as
relates to the first instruction asked for by -the plaintiffs below.
IIL.- First and second Instructions. The bill of exceptions
begins on page 8, and ends on page 133, (as before stated,)
and includes the instructions moved by the plaintiffs and refused by the court, and the charge to the jury as given,pp. 136137.
1. As to both Instructions. The first instructibn, moved by
the plaintiffs and refused, comprises the period from the 3d of
February, 1848, the day on which the treaty of peace and cession to the United States of California was signed, to the 3d
of March, 1849, the day on which the act of Congress was
approved for making California a collectbn district and San
Francisco a port of entry.
The second instruction, moved by the plaintiffs and refused
bythe court, comprehends the period from the 3d of March,
1849, when the act of iongress passed for making California a

DECEMBER TERMI, 1853.

Cross et al. v. Harrison.

collection district, to the 13th of November, 1849,when the collector, Collier, appointed under that act, arrived at San Francisco and entered upon the d-uties of his office.
These two instructions may be considered together; they
assert, in substance, that the collections of duties by the defendant, Harrison, were illegal exactions, for which the defendant is
responsible to the plaintiffs in this action; for that, during the
farst period, "no duties accrued to the United States on inerchandise not the production of the United States, nor on vesses
not of the United States, which anrived within the limits of
California; and during the second period, that nobody but Collier was authorized to collect duties in California until ",Col
lector Collier entered upon his duties as collector of the customs
at the port of San Francisco."
The instructions must be considered as having been asked of
the court in reference to the evidence given, and must be perti
nent to that evidence, and must be the deductions of law properly arising out of the facts. which the evidence conduces to
prove; if not so, the court ought to refuse to give the instructions.
The court is not bound to entertain abstract propositions, nor
should the judge bewilder the jury with instructions couched in
language to lead them astray.
'T'he plaintifi' own evidence (for the defendant adduced none)
proved1. That the foreign merchandise, and foreign vessels laden
with the mercha,-1ise in question, were not only imported into
California with tne intent to be there unladen, but were actually
unladen and landed at the port of San Francisco.
2. That the plaintiffs were warned that if the merchandise
was unladen at San Francisco without the payment of duties,
they would be liable to seizure and forfeiture; were left at liberty
to carry the goods, wares, and merchandise, to some other port
in the United States, and there make entry and payment of the
duties, or to pay the proper duties at San Franckco, and save
the expense of going elsewhere and the forfeiture; that the
plaintit' elected to pay the duties, and did pay them voluntarily,
without compulsion, without force, and for no other cause than
the warning and election so given them.
3. That no other or higher duties were paid by plaintiffs and
received by the defendant than were imposed by the laws of the
United States.
4. That the defendant was lawfully appointed and acting
under the government of California, instituted during the war
between the United States and MIexico, and continued in being,
operation, and effect, after the treaty of peace and cession of

SUPREME COURT.
Cross et al. v. Harrison.

the conquered territory of California to the United States, and
so continued, and solely existing in fact, and in operation, during the whole period of time comprised in the instructions asked
by the plaintiffs.
5. That the defendant received the duties to the use of the
United states, and had "disbursed and paid out to and for the
use of the United States" all the moneirs received from the
plaintifs except the sums repaid to the plaintiffs for drawbacks
on goods reixported.
Upon such proof as to the mild alternative given, and the
election thereupbn made by fhe plaintiffo, and the voluntary
payments of duties according to their election, no cause of action
can arise to the pJaintiffi unless the defendant falsely affirmed
to the plaintiffs that their goods would be liable to seizure and
forfeiture if landed in California without permit, and without
having paid-the duties accruing to the United States.
2. As to the first Instruclio separately. The first instruction
asked by plaintiffs, therefore, asserts, "that during the period
from the 2d day of February, 1848, the date of the treaty of
peace and limits "vith the Republic of Mexico, and the 3d of
March, 1849, th6 date of the act of Congress which erected
the State of California into a collection district of the United
States, no duties accrued to the United States on merchandise
not the production of the United States, which arrived within
the limits of California ceded by said tr.3aty," and applying
that instruction to the facts that the goods, and vessels wherein
they were laden, were imported into California with intent to
be unladen, and were actually there landed, it asserts that the
said goods, and the vessels from which they were so unladen,
were not liable to seizure and forfeiture if the duties were unpaid.
The error of those propositions of the plaintiffs is proved by
inspection of the following statutes :
Act of July 30, 1846, 9 Statutes at Large, 42, c. 74; Act of
July 20, 1790, 1 Statutes at Large, 135, .c. 30, for imposing
diaties of tonnage on ships and vessels; and of January 14,
1817 ; 3 lb. 345, c. 3, supplementary to an act to regulate the
collection of duties on imports and tonnage. Act of March 2,
1799: "An act to regulate the collection cf duties on imports
and tonnage." 1 Statutes at Large, 639, c. 22 §§ 18, 92.
The first act above mentioned, of July 80, 1846, enacts, " That
from and- after the first day of December next, in lieu of the
duties heretofore imposed by law on the articleQ hereinafter
mentioned, and on such as may be now exempt from duty, there
shall be levied and collected and paid on the goods, wares, and

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.
Cross et al. v. Harrison.

merchandise herein enumerated and provided for, imported
from foreign countries, the following rates of duty - that is to
say," &c.
This is the titriff of duties by which the plaintiffs paid the
moneys to the defendant. '
The second and third acts before cited, imposing duties of
tonnage on ships and vessels, need not be recited.
The 1Sth section of the act of March 2d, 1799-to regulate
the collection on imports and tonnage, before cited, (vol. 1,
639)- enacts, "That it shall not be lawful to make entry of
any ship or vessel which shall arrive from any foreign port or
place within the United States, or of the cargo on board such
ship or vessel, elsewhere than at one of the ports of entry,...
nor to unlade the said cargo or any part thereof elsewhere
than at one of the ports of delivery" established by law: "Provided, always, that every port of entry shall be also a port of
delivery."
Section 62 prohibits any permit for the landing of goods to
be granted until the duties thereon are paid or secured to be
paid.
Section 63 prohibits any perrhit to be granted for unlading a
vessel until the tonnage duty thereon is paid.
"Section 92. That except into the districts herein before described on the northern, northwestern, and western boundaries
of the United States, adjoining to the dominions of Great Britain in Upper alid Lower Canada, and the districts on the
rivers Ohio and Mississippi, no goods, wares, or merchandise
of foreign growth or manufacture, subject to the payment of
duties, shall be brought into the United States from any foreign
port or place in any other manner than by sea, nor in any ship
or vessel of less than thirty tons burden, agreeably to the admeasrc'nient hereby directed for ascertaining the tonnage of
ships or vessels; nor shall be landed or unladen at any other
port than is directed by this act, under the penalty of seizure
and forfeiture of all such ships or vessels, and of the goods,
wares, or merchandise imported theiein, landed or unladen in
any other mariner. And no drawback of any duties on goods,
wares, or merchandise, of foreign growth or manufacture shall
be allowed on the exportation thereof from any district of the
United States, otherwise than by sea and in vessels not less
than thirty tens burden."
This aut df 1799, in its various sections, and particularflr
in sections 18, 62, 63, and 92, taken together, protect tbhe
revenue from being evaded or defrauded by importing and
landing goods in the United States at ports or places where the
United States have not established a port of entry or delivery,

180

SUPREMIE COUIT.
Cross et al. v. IHarriscn.

and likewise from the landing of goods even at a port of entry
or of delivery without a permit, which permit cannot be granted
until the duties on imports and tonnage have been paid or
secured to be paid.
The defendant therefore truly informed i:he plaintiffs that their
goods, if landed at San Francisco without permit and payment
of duties, would be liable to :eizure and forfeiture, and the
vessel also from which such unlawful unlading was effected.
The first instruction asked is totally erroneous in supposing
that no duties would accrue to the United States upon foreign
goods nor upon foreign vessels arriving in California, and there
unlading their cargoes between February 2, 1848, and March
3, 1849. It is a most egregious blunder to assert, that after
the United States had acquired California by treaty, and before
they had provided by after law for a collection district, and a
collector in that country, the citizens of tPe United States and
foreigners might lawfully inundate the 3ountry with foreign
goods, wares, and merchandise, without in curring any liabilities
for duties on imports and tonnage; thal; the former laws and
government ceased eo instante upon the treaty of peace and
cession; and that there was no law, no government, no order
there until the Congress bf the United StatQs had legislated,
and the executive department had acted in pursuance of such
new legislation upon the new state of things growing out of
the war and the ensuing peace.
In so far as the revenue from duties on imports and tonnage
was concerned, in the acquisition of Upper California, the act
of 1799 had effectually provided against the importation of
foreign dutiable goods into that country, and landing them
there free of duty. And the existing government and its laws
and officers provided the means of causing these revenue laws
to be respected and obeyed until the Congress of the United
States had provided the proper officers of the customs adapted
to the new state of things.
Before the treaty, and under the government instituted and
existing in fact in Upper California, dutiei of import and tonnage were levied and co.llected, and a system for the collection
of those duties was in full, actual, effective operatiorr; sanctioned
by the President of the United States, the civil and military governor of the territory, supported by the naval force of the United
States in the Pacific Ocean, and by the army of the United
States then in California. The defendant Harrison was the
collector of customs appointed by the then existing government,
and acted in obedience to the laws and instructions of that
government.
Upon the cession of California to the United States, "the

laws, whether in writing or evidenced by the usage and customs
of the ceded country," continued in force until altered by the
new sovereign. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Peters, 436; Mitchell v.
United States, 9 Peters, 749.
Such is the law of nations. Vattel, edition 1853, 358. So it
is by the common law.

165; 4 Corn. Dig. Ley. (C.)
The first instruction, so moved by the plaintiffs, was an improper deduction of law from the facts proved by the plaintiffs'
6wn evidence, oral and docunlentary, conducing, if given, to
confuse and mislead the jury, and was therefore properly overruled.
Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
This case comes up, by writ of error, from the Circuit Court
of the United States for the Southern District of New York.
It was an action brought by Cross, Hobson and Company
against Harrison, for the return of duties alleged to be illegally
exacted by Harrison whilst he was acting as collector of the
customs at the port of San Francisco, in California. The claim
covered various amounts of money which were paid at intervals
between the 3d day of February, 1848, and the 13th of November, 1849. The first of these dates was that of the treaty of
peace between the United States and Mexico, and the latter
when i. Collier, a person who bad been regularly appointed
collector at that port, entered upon the performance of the duties
of his office. During the whole of this period it was alleged by
the plaintiffs that there existed no legal authority to receive or
collect any duty whatever accruing upon goods imported from
foreign countries.
The period of time above mentioned was subdivided by the
plaintiffs in the prayers which they made to the court below,
into two portions, to each of which they supposed that different
rules of law attached. The three periods may be stated as follows:

3d of February, 1848, the date of the treaty of peace between
the United States and Mexico. 9 Stat. ab Large, 922 to 943.

the United States. And
13th of November, 1849, when. Collecto: Collier entered upon
the duties of his office.
In order to show what was the state of things on the 3d of
February, 1848, it is necessary to refer to some of the public
documents which were offered in evidence by the plaintiffs, being Senate Document No. 18 of the first session of the thirtyfirst Congress.
On the 19th of August, 1847, H. W. J3alleck, signing himself " Lieutenant of Engineers and Secretary of State for the
Territory of California," issued a circular to certain persons who
had been appointed collectors of the customs, in which he recited that the commander-in-chief of the naval forces had been
authorized by the President of the United States to establish
port regulations, to prescribe the conditio as under which American and foreign vessels might be admitted into the ports of
California, and also to regulate the import duties. The circular
then prescribed certain rules which were to be observed.
On the 15th of September, 1847, Commodore Shubrick prescribed certain rates, or scales of duties, which were confirmed
on the 14th of the ensuing October, by R. B. Mason, who
signed himself Colonel of the 1st dragoons and Governor of
California.
On the 20th of October, 1847, Colonel. Mason, still styling
himself Governor of California, issued e.n order saying, that
"recent instructions from the President of the United States
made the officers of the army and navy the collectors of the
customs In California." The arrangement was made accordigly.
This was the state of things up to the 'ld of February, 1848,
the first epoch mentioned by the plaintifls in their prayers to
the court. The war tariff was collected by officers of the army
and navy.
On the 3d of February, 1848, a treaty of peace was signed
between the United States and Mexico, the ratifications of
which. were exchanged on the 30th of May ensuing. Some
alterations were made in the mode of collecting the revenue
during this second period of time, namely, between the 3d of
February, 1848, and 3d c-f March, 18419, which it is necessary
to notice.
On the 26th of July, 1848, Colonel Mason, still calling himself Governor of California, issued a numoer of regulations for

the government of the custom-house, amongst which the following two may be mentioned:
"7. If any master of a vessel shall be detected in landing, or
attempting to land, anywhere in California, any goods or merchandise, without permit from a collector, he shall be fined for
every such offence in the sum of five hundred dollars, and the
goods or merchandise so landed, or attempted to be landed, and
the boat or boats through which such landing is effected or
attempted, shall be seized, forfeited, and sold by the nearest
collector.
"6. If any person or persons other than the master of a vessel shall be detected in landing, or attempting to land, anywhere
in California, any goods or merchandise, without permit from a
collector, he or they shall be fined in the sum of one hundred
dollars, and the goods or merchandise so landed, or attempted
to be landed, and the boat or boats through which such landing
is effected or attempted, shall be seized, forfeited, and sold by
the nearest collector."
On the 7th of August, 1S48, a proclamation was issued to
the people of California, by R. B. Mason, the governor, announcing the ratification of the treaty of peace, by which Upper
California was ceded to the United States.
On the 9th of August, H. W. Halleck, lieutenant of engineers
and Secretary of State, wrote to Captain Folsom, the collector
of the customs at San Francisco, directing him to perform the
duties until further orders, but announcing that he would be
relieved as soon as some suitable citizen could be found to be
appointed his successor. In the mean time he was told "the
tariff of duties for the collection of military contributions will
immediately cease, and the revenue laws and tariff of the United States will be substituted in its place."
In order to illustrate the view which Colonel Mason took of
his position, it may be proper to insert the following extract
from a letter written by hun to the War Department on the 14th
of August, 1848:
In like manner, if all customs were withdrawn, and the
ports thrown open free to the world, San Francisco would be
made the depit or all the foreign goods in the north Pacilic, to'
the injury of our revenue and the interests of our own mnerchants. To prevent this great influx of foreign goods into the
country duty free, I feel it my duty to attempt the collection of
dutiet according to the United States Tariff of 1846. This will
render it inecessary for ine to a)l)oint temporary collectors, &c.,
in the several ports of entry, fbr the military force is too much
reduced to attend to those duties.

ther authority than that the existing government must necessarily coninue until some other is organized to take its place, for
I have been left without any definite instructions in reference
to the existing state of affairs. But the calamities and disorders which *wouldsurely follow the absolute withdrawal of even
a show of authority, impose on me, in my opinion, the imperative duty to pursue the course I have indicated, until the arrival of despatches from Washington (which I hope are already
on their way) relative to the organization of a regular civil
government. In the mean time, however, should the people
refuse to obey the existing authorities, or the merchants refuse
to pay any duties, my force is inadequate to compel obedience2
On the 3d of September, 1848, Governor Mlason appointed
Edward H. Harrison temporary collector of the port of San
Francisco, with a salary of two thousand. dollars per annum,
provided that so much was collected over and above the expenses of the custom-house.
In order further to illustrate the view which was taken by the
Executive branch of the government, of the existing condition
of things in California, it is proper to insert an extract from a
despatch written by Mr. Buchanan, Secretary of State, to Mr.
Voorhees, on the 7th of October, 1848. It is as follows:
" The President, in his annual message, at the commencement of the next session, will recommend all these great measures to Congress in the strongest terms, and will use every
effort, consistent with his duty, to insure tfaeir accomplishment.
"In the mean time, the condition of the people of California
is anomalous, and will require, on their part, the exercise of
great prudence and discretion. By the conclusion of the Treaty
of Peace, the military government which was established over
them under the laws of war, as recognized by the practice ef
all civilized nations, has ceased to derive its authority from this
source of power. But is there, for this reason, no government
in California? Are life, liberty, and property under the protection. of no existing authorities? This would be a, singular phenomenon in the face of the world, and especially among -American citizens, distinguished as they are above all other people
for their law-abiding character. Fortunately, they are not reduced to this sad condition. The termination of the war left
an existing government, a government defizcto, in full operation,
and this will continue, with the presumed consent of the people, until Congress shall provide for them a territorial government. The great law of necessity justifies this conclusion.
The consent of the people is irresistibly inferred from the fact
that no civilized community could possibly desire to abrogate

an existing government, when the alternative presented would
bte to place themselves in a state of -anarchy, beyond the protection of all laws, and reduce them to the unhappy necessity of
submitting to the dominion of the strongest.
"This government de facto will, of course, exercise no pover
inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution of the United
States, which is the supreme law of the land. For this reason
no import duties can be levied in California on articles the
growth, produce, or manufacture of the United States, as no
such duties can be imposed in any other part of our Union on
the productions of California. Nor can new duties be charged
in California upon such foreign productions as have already paid
duties in any of our ports of entry, for the obvious reason that
California is within the territory of tle United States. I shall
not enlarge upon this subject, however, as the Secretary of the
Treasury will perform that duty"
At the same time, despatches were issued by the War and
Treasury Departments to their respective officers, of similar import to the above. Mr. Walker, the Secretary of the Treasury,
after providing for the reciprocal admiszion of goods which were
the growth, &c., of California and the United States, free of duty,
into the ports of each, thus provided for the case under consideration, so as to protect the revenue: "Third. Although the Constitution of the United States extends to California, and Congress have recognized it by law as a part of the Union, and legislated for it as such, yet it is not brought by law within the limits
of any collection district, nor has Congress authorized the appointment of any officers to collect the revenue accruing on the
import of foreign dutiable goods into that territory. Under these
circumstances, although this department may be unable to collect the duties accruing on importations from foreign countries
into California, yet, if foreign dutiable goods should be introduced there, and shipped thence to any port or place of the United
States, they will be subject to duty, as also to all the penalties
prescribed by law when such impQrtation is attempted without

When these papers reached California, some doubt was enteltained whether or not the revenue laws would be enforced,
and application was made to Commodore Jones, then commanding the naval forces in the Pacific, to know whether he would
use tie forces under his command to aid the collector in seizing
and confiscating goods, &c. ; to which the commodore replied
that he would so employ the force under his command.

protested against the payment of $105.62, duties which accrued
'apon an importation by the French bark Staonele, and also protested against the payment of duties upon all other importations,
past, present, or to come.
In order still further to explain the views of those who administered the government in California, it may be proper to introduce another extract from instructions which were issued on
t~he 2d of February, 1849, by H. W. Halleck, Secretary of State,
to Mr. Harrison, the collector, namely:
"This view of the subject presents a readly reply to the questions proposed in your letter. No vessel can demand as a right
to enter any foreign dutiable goods here, and you will not be
liable to prosecution for refusing such entry; and by a voluntary
payment of her duties here, in preference to going to a regularly
established port of entry, such vessel binds herself to abide by
the revenue laws of the United States, in the absence of all instructions to the contrary."
On the 3d of March, 1849, (another of the periods of time
mentioned in the prayers to the court,) Congr ss passed an act
(9 Stat. at Large, 400,) maling the port of San Francisco a collection district.
On the 13th of November, 1849, Collector Collier, who had
been regularly appointed, entered upon the execution of his
duty at San Francisco. This was the thi:d period referred to
in. the prayers to the court.
In April, 1851, Cross, Hobson, and Company brought an action
of trespass on the case in the Circuit Court of the United States
for the Southern District of New York, against Edward H.
Harrison, to recover sundry sums of money paid, under the above
protest, for duties upon goods imported into San Francisco, (luring the period between the 3d of February, 1848, and the I2t
of November, 1849.
Upon the trial, the jury, vnder the instructions of the court
found a verdict for the defendant.
The bill of exceptions contained the deposition of sundry persons as to the payment and other facts in the case, and also the
whole of the Senate Document above mentioned.
-Thecounsel for the plaintiffs then rested; and the counsel
for the plaintiffs thereupon prayed the court to charge and instruct the jury, as matter of law, as follows:
1. That during the period from the 3d day of February, 1848,

Mexico, and the 3d of March, 1849, the date of the act of Congress which erected the State of California into a collection district of the United States, no duties accrue to the United States

vessels not of the United States which arrived within the limits
of California, ceded by said treaty to the United States, and that
the exaction by the defendant of such alleged duties on such
goods imported into California by the plaintiffs within said period was not authorized by any law of the United States, and
was therefore illegal.
2. That during the period from the 3d of Mlarch, 1849, when
the act of Congress erected the State of California into a collection district, and the 13th of November, 1849, when Collector
Collier entered upon his duties as collector of customs at the
port of San Francisco, in said district, the exaction of -alleged
duties to the United States, by the defendant, was not authorized by"any law of the United States, and was therefore
illegal, unless the jury shall find that the defendant was legally
appointed and qualified to act as collector of the customs at
San Francisco.
3. That if the jury shall find that on the 23d February, 1849,
the plaintiffs made their written protest against all exactio-is that
then weres or thereafter should be made by said defendant, as unauthorized by any act of Congress and illegal, and that moneys
then and thenceforward were demanded as alleged duties to
the United States by said defendant, and were paid under
coercion of military power and duress, and not in pursuance
of any law of the United States, that then such exactions were
unauthorized and illegal, and the jury must find for the plaintiffs.
4. That if the jury shall find from the evidence that alleged
duties were exacted by the defendant from the plabitiffs between the 3d February, 1848, and the 12th November, 1849, by
coercion and duress, and against their remonstrance and protest,
that then the plaintiffs are entitled to the customary interest of
California upon such exactions.
Whereupon the court, pro forma, then and there charged and
instructed the jury in conformity with the following prayers, in
conformity with which the defendant's counsel insisted and
prayed the court to instruct the jury as matters of law:
1. That between the 3d February, 1848, and the 3d March,
1849, duties did accrue to the United States, on foreign merchandise, not the production of the United States, and on foreign
vessels not of the United States, which were imported into and
arrived within the limits of California, as ceded to the United
States by the treaty of peace and limits with the Republic of
Mexico, signed at Guadaloupe Hidalgo.
2. That after the act of 3d Mlarch, 1849, erecting the State
of California into a collection district of the United States, took
effect, duties accrued to the United States, both on foreign mer-

chandise, not the-production of the United States, and on foreign
vessels not of the United States, imported and brought within
the limits of such collectioi district.
3. That if, from the evidence in the cause, the jury shall find
that between the 3d February, 1848, and 12th November, 1849,
the plaintiffs were allowed by. the defendant to enter their said
foreign goods and vessels at another port of the United States
within a collection district, and thereafter to land the same at
San Francisco without further exaction of duties, and that the
plaintiffs neglected so to do, and elected -to enter and land the
same at San Francisco, and pay duties thereon, and that the
duties were paid by defendant to the use of the United States,
that then the said payment of duties was voluntary and not
coercive, and the jury must find for the defendant.
4. That if the jury shall find that the plaintiffs paid duties to
the defendant on foreign merchandise, and on foreign vessels,
not of the United States, between the 3d February, 1848, and
12th November, 1849, and that such payments were illegal but
voluntary, and made through mistake of law, then the plaintiffs
are not entitled to interest upon such exactions, and that upon
the whole 'evidence the payments aforesaid were voluntary and
not coercive.
. And the court further, pro forma, refused to instruct and
charge the jury in conformity with the points insisted upon by
the plaintiffs' counsel, and in conformity with which he had
prayed the court to charge and instruct the jury as aforesaid.
Upon this exception, the case came up to this court.
This statement presents the case of the plaintiffs as strongly
as it can be made from the record, and that contains every fact
and document having any connection with the subject. The
cause has been argued here -with much research. Every argarXent has been brought to bear upon it by counsel on both
sides, which can enter into its consideration. It seems, from
the itistitution of the suit, until now, to have been conducted
with the wish upon the part of the United States to give to the
plaintiffs eveiy opportunity to establish their claim judicially, if
that 'euld be done; and with a desire upon its part to obtain
from this court a decision as to what are the rights of the United States in respect to tonnage and impost duties, in such a
conjuncture as that was, when California was ceded by treaty
to the United States, before Congress had authorized such duties
to be collected there by a special act. We have received much
assistance from the argument, and make the acknowledgment
the more readily because it has enabled us to come to conclusions which we believe will be satisfactory, though adverse from
the claim of the plaintiffs.

DECEMBER TER-M,
Cross et al. v.

Harrison.

The purpose of the suit is to recover from the defendant certain tonnage duties and imppsts which were paid to him by the
plaintiffs upbn ships which had arrived in San Francisco, and
upon foreign merchandise landed there from them, between the
3d February, 1848, and the 13th November, 1849. Harrison
had been appointed collector for the port of San Francisco by
Colonel Mason, military governor of California. He told the
plaintiffs, officially, that he would not permit them to land their
goods without the payment of duties; stating if they attempted
to do so, without having made an entry of them, that they
wuld be seized and forfeited. He placed an inspector of the
customs on board of the vessels,of the plaintiffs, to prevent any
merchandise from being landed from them without permits and
entries, and when they complained that the duties which they
were required to pay were illegal exactions, which they protested against, the collector refused to receive the duties under
protest, and told the plaintiffs that they might enter their ships
at some other port in the United States, and then discharge
their goods at San Francisco. That he considered San Francisco a port in the United States at which foreign goods could
not be landed without the payment of duties. It is as well to
remark here, though the same fact appears in our statement of
the case already given, that the duties for which the plaintiffs
sue were paid by them between the 3d February, 1848, and the
12th November, 1849. They were paid, however, until some
time in the fall of 1848, at the rate of the war tariff; which
had been established early in the year before by the direction
of the President of the United States.
The authority for that purpose given to the commander-inchief of our naval force on that station, was, to establish port
regulations, to prescribe the conditions upon which American
and foreign vessels were to be admitted into the ports of California, and to regulate import duties. That war tariff, however, was abandoned as soon as the military governor had
received from Washington information of the exchange and
ratification of the treaty with Mexico, and duties were afterwards levied in conformity with such as Congress liad imposed
upon foreign merchandise imported into the other ports of the
United States, Upper California having been ceded by the
treaty to the United States. This last was done with the assent
of the Executive of the United States, or without any interference to prevent it. Indeed, from the letter of the then Secretary of State, and from ihat of the Secretary of the Treasury,
we cannot doubt that the action of the military governor of
California was recognized as allowable and lawful by Mr. Polk
and his cabinet. We think it was a rightful and correct recog-

SUPREME

COURT.

Cross et al. v. Harrison.

nition under all the circumstances, and when we say rightful,
we mean that it wts constitutional, although Congress had not
passed an act to extend the collection of tonnage and import
duties to the ports of California.
California, or the port of San Francisco, had been conquered
by the arms of the United States as early as 1846. Shortly
afterward the United States had military possession of all of
Upper California. Early in 1847 the President, as constitutional commander-in-chief of the army and navy, authorized the
military and naval commander of our fo:ces in California to
exercise the belligerent rights of a conqueror, and to form a
civil government for the conquered- country, and to impose
-duties on imports and tonnage as military contributions for the
.sqpport of the government, and of the army which had the cor.qpest in possession. We will add, by way of note to this opinion, references to all of the correspondence of the government
upon this subject; now only referring to the letter of the Secretary at War to General Kearney, of the 10th of May, 1847,
which was accompanied with a tariff of duties on imports and
tonnage, which had been prepared by the Secretary of the
.Treasury, with forms of entry and permits for landing goods,
all of which was reported by the Secretary to th. President on
the 30th of March, 1847, Senate Doe. No. 1, 1st session, 80th
Congress, 1847, pp. 567, 5S3. No one can dcubt that these orders
of the President, and the action of our army and navy commander in California, in conformity with them, was according to
the law of arms and the right of conquest, or that they were
operative untit the ratification and exchange of a treaty of
peace. Such would be the case upon general principles in
respect to war and peace between nations. In this instance it
is recognized by the treaty itself. Nothing i8 stipulated in that
treaty to b6 binding upon the parties to it, or from the date of
the signature of the treaty, but that commissioners should be
appointed by the general-in-chief of the forces of the United
States, with such -as might be appointed by the Mexican government, to make a provisional suspension o:. hostilities, that, in
the places occupied by our arms, constitutional order might be
reestablished as regards the political, administrative, and judicial branches in those places, so far as that might be permitted
by' the circumstances of military occupation. All else was
contingent until the rdtifications of the treaty were exchanged,
whicll was done on the 30th of May, 1848, at Queretaro; and
there is in the 3d article of the treaty a full recognition by Mexico of the' belligerent rights exercised by the United States
during the war in its ports which had been conquered. In that
article, besides other things provided for, it was stipulated that
-

the United States, upon the ratifications of the treaty by the
two republics, should despatch orders to all persons in charge
of the custom houses~at all ports occupied by the forces of the
United States, to deliver possession of the same to persons
authorized by Mexico to receive them, together with all bonds
and evidences of debts for duties on importations and exportations not yet fallen due, and that an exact account should be
made out, showing the entire amount of all duties on imports
and exports collected at such custom houses or elsewhere in
Mexico by the authority of the United States after the ratification of the treaty by Mexico, with the cost of collection, all of
which was to be paid to the Mexican government, at the city
of Mexico, within three months after the exchange of ratifications, subject to a deduction of what had been the cost of collection.
The plaintiffs therefore can have no right to the return of any
moneys paid by them as duties on foreign merchandise in San
Francisco up to that date.
Until that time California had not
been ceded, in fact, to the United States, but it was a conquered
territory, within which the United States were exercising belligerent rights, and whatever sums were received for duties .upon
fbreign merchandises, they were paid under them.
But-after the ratification of the treaty, California became a
part of the United States, or a ceded, conquered territory. Our
inquiry here is to be, whether or npt the cession gave any right
to the plaintiffs tu have the duties restored to them, which they
may have paid between the ratifications and exchange of the
treaty and the notification of that fact by our government to
the military governor of California. It was not received by him
until two months after the ratification, and not then with any
instructions or even remote intimation from the President that
the civil and military government, which had been instituted
during the war, was discontinued.
Up to that time, whether
such an intimation had or had not been given, duties had been
collected under the war tariff; strictly in conformity with the
instructions which had been received from Washington.
It -vill certainly not be denied that those instructions were
binding upon those who administered the civil government in
California, until they had notice from their own government
that a peace had been finally concluded. Or that those who
were locally within its jurisdiction, or who had property there,
were not bound to comply with those regulations of the government, which its functionaries were ordered to execute.
Or
that any one could claim a right to introduce into the territory

of duties which had been originally imposed under belligerent

rights, because the territory had been ceded by the original possessor and enemy to the conqueror. Or that the mere fact of a
territory having been ceded by one sovereignty to another,
ppens' it to a free commercial intercourse with all the world, as
a matter of course, until the new possessor has legislated some
terms upon which that may be done. There is no such commercial liberty known among nations, and the attempt to introduce it in this instance is resisted by all of those considerations
which have made foreign commerce between nations conven
tional. "The treaty that gives the right of commerce, is the

Vattel, c. 8, § 93.
measure and rule of that right."
plaintiffs in this case could claim no privilege for the introduction of their goods into San Francisco between the ratifications
of the treaty with lexico and the official annunciation of it to
the civil government in California, other than such as that
government permitted under the ingtructions of the government
of the United States.
We must consider them as having paid the duties upon their
importations voluntarily, notwithstanding that they protested
against the right of the collector to exact them. Their protest
was made from a misconception of the principles applicable to
.the circumstances .under which those duties were claimed, and
from their misapprehension of what were the commercial consequences resu]ting from the treaty of peace with Mexico and
the cession of California to the United States. That treaty
gave them no right to carry foreign goods there upon which
duties had not been paid in one of our ports of entry. The
best test of the correctness of what has just been said is this:
that if such goods had been landed there duty free, they could
not have been shipped to any other port in the United States
without being liable to pay duty.
Having considered and denied the claim of the plaintiffs to a
restoration of the duties paid by them from the date of the
treaty up to the time when official notice of its ratification and
exchange were received in California, -. e pass on fo the examination of their claim from that time uhtil the revenue system
in respect to tonnage and import duties had been put into practical operation in California, undek the aci; of Congress passed
for that purpose. The ratification of the treaty of peace was
proclaimed in California, by Colonel Mason, on the 7th of August, 1848. Up to this time it must be remembered that Captain Folsom, of the quartermaster's department of the army,
had been the collector of duties under the war tariff. On the
9th of August, he was informed by Lieutenant Halleck, of the
engineer corps, who was the Secretary of State of the civil
government of California, that he would be 'relieved as soon as.

a suitable citizen could be found for his successor. He was also
told that "the tariff of duties for the collection of military contributions was immediately to cease, and that.the revenue laws
and tariff of the United States will be substituted in its place."
The view taken by Governor Mason, of his position, has been
given in our statement. The result was to continue the existing
government, as he had not received from Washington definite
instructions in reference to the existing state of things in California.
His position was unlike any thing that had preceded, it in the
history of our country. The view taken of it by himself has
been given in the statement in the beginning of this opinion.
It was not without its difficulties, both as regards the principle
upon which he should act, and the actual state of affairs in California. He knew that the Mexican inhabitants of it had been
remitted by the treaty of peace to those municipal laws and
usages which prevailed among them before the territory had
been ceded to the United States, but that a state of things and
population had grown up during the war, and after the treaty
of peace, which made some other authority necessary to maintain the rights of the ceded inhabitants and of immigrants,
frbm misrule and violence. He may not have comprehended
fully the principle applicable to what he might rightly do in
such a case, but he felt rightly, and acted accordingly. He determined, in the absence of all instruction, to maintain the
existing government. The territory had been ceded as a conquest, and was to be preserved and governed as such until the
sovereignty to which it had passed had legislated for it. That
sovereignty was the United States, under the Constitution, by
which power had been given to Congress to dispose of and
make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory
or other property belonging to the United States, with the powei
also to admit new States into this Union, with only such limitations as are expressed in the section in which this power is
given. The government, of which Colonel Mason was the exe,
cutive, hadits origin in the lawful exercise of a belligerent right
over a conquered territory. It had been instituted during the
war by the command of the President of the United States. It
was the government when the territory was ceded as a conquest,
and it did not cease, as a matter of course, or as a necessary
consequence of the restoration of peace. The President might
have dissolved it by withdrawing the army and navy officers
who administered it, but he did not do so. Congress could
have put aa end to it, but that was not done. The right inference from the inaction of both is, that it was meant to be continued until it had been legislatively changed. No presumption

of a contrary intention, can be made. Whatever may have been
the causes of delay, it must be presumed that the delay was
consistent with the true policy of the government. And the
more so as it was continued until the people of the territory
met in convention to form a State government, which was
subsequently recognized by Congress under its power to admit
new States into the Union.
In confirmation of what has been said in respect to the power
of Congress over this territory, and .the continuance of the civil
government established as a war right, until Congress acted
upon the subject, we refer to two of the decisions of this court,
in one of which it is said in respect to the treaty by which
Florida was ceded to the United States: " This treaty is the
law of the land, and admits the inhabitartts of Florida to the
enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and iramunities, of the citizens of the United States. It is unnecessary to inquire whether
this is not their condition, independently of stipulations. They
do not however participate in political power-they do not
share in the government until Florida shall become a State. In
the mean time Florida continues to be a territory of the United
States, guarded ,by virtue of that clause in the Constitution
which empowers Congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the
United States. Perhaps the power of governing a territory belonging to the United States, which has not, by becoming a State,
acquired the means of self-government, may result necessarily
from the facts that it is not within the jurisdiction of any par.
ticular State, and is within the power and jurisdiction of the
United States. The right to govern may be the natural consequences of the right to acquire territory." American Insurance
Co. v. Canter, 1 Peters, 542, 543.
The court, afterwards, in the case of the United States v.
Gratiot, 14 Peters, 526, repeats what it said in the case of Canter in respect to that clause of the Constitution giving to Congress the power to make all needful rules and regulations
respecting the territory or other property of the United States.
Colonel Mason was fortunate in hkving ]Is determination to
continue the existing government sustained by the President of
the United States and the Secretaries of his cabinet. And
nothing but an almost willing misunderstanding of the circular
of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Walker, could have caused
a doubt as to the liability of the importers of foreign goods into
California to pay duties upon them. Thct part of the Secretary's circular relating to duties is in our statement of the case.
It will show that the Secretary says no more than this: that
as Congress had not brought California by law within the limits

of any collection district, or authorized the appointment of officers to collect the revenue accruing upon the importation of
foreign dutiable goods into that territory, that his department
may be unable to collect them. Revenue accruing upon the
importation into California of foreign dutiable goods, means
that the goods were liable to pay the duty. There is nothing
uncertain in the Secretary's circular. It does not warrant in
any way the declaration that it was his opinion that the goods
were not dutiable, or that they might not be legally collected,
though that could not be done by the instrumentality of officers
of a collection district. Our conclusion, from what has been
said, is, that the civil government of California, organized as it
was from a right of conquest, did not cease or become defunct
in consequence of the signature of the treaty or from its ratification. We think it was continued over a ceded conquest,
without any violation of the Constitution or laws of the United
States, and that until Congress legislated for it, the duties upon
foreign goods imported into San Francisco were legally dermanded and lawfully received by Mr. Harrison, the collector of
the port, who received his appointment, according to instructions from Washington, from Governor lason.
But it was assumed in the argument, and not without force
and ingenuity, and with some appearance of authority, that
duties did not accrue to the United States upon foreign goods
brought into California between the 3d of February, 1848, and
the 3d of Mach, 1849, and from the last date until the 12th of
November, 1849; and that the exaction of them was illegal.
The two first dates mentioned, comprehend the time between
the date of the treaty and the date of the act of Congress which
incladed California within one of the collection districts of the
United States, and the other date comprehends the time from
the date of the act of Congress until Mr. Collier, the collector,
entered upon the duties of his office. It was also said by
counsel, that as there was no treaty or law enjoining or permitting the collection of the duties,, that the exaction of them by
the defendant was illegal. It was said, that the duties were
illegally exacted, because the laws of a ceded country, including
those of trade, remained unchanged ujtil the new sovereignty
of it changed them, and that this Congress had not done.
That the practice of the United States had been, not to collect
duties upon importations upon goods brought into a ceded territory, until Congress passed an act for it to be done. Louisiana
and Florida were the instances cited; and the ratification by
North Carolina and Rhode Island of the Constitution of the
United States, were also mentioned as having been the subjects of special legislation to bring them within the operation
of the revenue laws which had been passed by Congress.

SUPREME COURT.
Cross et al. v. Harrison.

And it was said, that as Congress has the constitutional
power to regulate commerce, and had not done so specifically
in respect to tonnage and import duties in California, that none
of the existing acts of Congress, for such purposes, could be
applied there until Congress had passed an act giving to them
operation, and had legislated California into a collection district,
with denominated ports of entry.
This last being the most important of the objections which
were made, we will examine it first, and afterwards notice those
which precede it. The objection assumes, ;hat,, under the laws
then in force, duties could not be collected in California after
the war with Iexico had been concluded by a treaty of peace;
and that the President had no legal authority to order the collection of duties there upon foreign goods, or power to enforce
any revenue regulations, or to prevent the landing of goods
prior to the passage of the act, by which ouiz revenue laws were
extended to California, and before prope:: officers had been
appointed to execute those laws. It has already been shown,
that for seven months of the time the dutieE. received were paid
under the war tariff, and that the treaty, though signed in 1848,
did not become operative until the ratifications and exchanges
of it. And further, that it could not have any effect upon the
existing government of California, until official information of
those ratifications had been received there. The belligerent
right of the United States to make a civil government in California when it was done, and to authorize it to collect tonnage
and impost duties whilst the war continued, is admitted.
It was urged, that our revenue laws covered only so much of
the territory of the United States as had been divided into collection districts, and that out of them no authority had been
given to prevent the landing of foreign good3 or to charge duties
upon them, though such landing had been made within the
territorial limits of the United States. To this it may be successfully replied, that collection districts and ports of entry are
no more than designated localities within rnd at which Congress had extended a liberty of ommerce in the United States,
and that so much of its territory as ,%as not within any collection district, must be considered as having been withheld from
that liberty. It is very well understood to be a part of the laws
of nations, that each nation may designate, upon its own terms,
the ports and places within its territory for foreign commerce,
and that any attempt to introduce foreign goods elsewhere,
within its jurisdiction, is a violation of its sovereignty. It is
not necessary that such should be declared in terms, or by any
decree or enactment, the expressed- allowances being the limit
of the liberty given to foreignere to trade with such nation.

Upon this principle, the plaintffs had no right of trade with
California with foreign goods, excepting from the permission
given by the United States under the civil government and war
tariff which had been established there. And when the country
was ceded as a conquest, by a treaty of peace, no larger liberty
to trade resulted. By the ratifications of the treaty, California
became a.part of the United States. And as there is nothing
differently stipulated in the treaty with respect to commerce, it
became instantly bound and privileged by the laws which Congress had passed to raise a revenue from duties on imports and
tonnage. It was bound by the eighteenth section of the act of
2d of March, 1799. The fair interpretation of the second member of the first sentence of that section is, that ships coming from
foreign ports into the United States were not to be permitted to
land any part of their cargoes in any other than in a port of delivery, confined then to the ports mentioned in the act; afterward
applicable to all other places which might be made ports of
entry and delivery, and excluding all right to unlade in any
part of the United States which had not been made a collection
district with ports of entry or delivery. The ninety-second section of that act had four objects in view. First, to exclude
foreign goods subject to the payment of duties from being
brought into the United States, except in the localities stated,
otherwise than by sea. Next, that they were not to be brought
by sea in vessels of less than thirty tons burden. And third, to
Pubject to forfeiture any foreign goods which might be landed
at any other port or place in the United States than such as
were designated by law. - Fourth, to exclude the allowances
of drawback of any duties on foreign goods exported from any
district in the United States otherwise than by sea, and in vessels less than thirty tons burden. The sxty-third section also
of that act, directing when tonnage duties were to be paid,
became as operative in California after its cession to the United
States, as it was in any collection district.
The acts of the 20th July, 1790, (1 Stat. at Large, 130,
c. 30,) and that of 2d larch, 1799, (1 Stat. at Large, 627, c. 22,)
were also of force in California without other special legislation
declaring them to be so. It cannot very well be contended
that the words "entered in the United States," give an exemption from them on account of the word entered, because a ship
has been brought into a port in the United States where an entry cannot be made, as it may be done in a collection district.
The goods must be entered before a permit for delivery can be
given. Shall one then be permitted to land goods in any part
of the United States not in a collection district, because he has
voluntarily gone there with his vessel where an entry of his

goods cannot be made; or to say, I know that my goods cannot be entered where I am, and therefore claim the right to land
them for sale and consumption free of duty?
It has been sufficiently shown that the plaintiffs had no right
to land their foreign goods in California at the times when their
ships arrived with them, except by a compliance with the regulations which the civil government were authorized to enforce
-first, under a war tariff, and afterward. under the existing.
Tariff Act of the United States. By the last, foreign goods, as

cause they are brought into a collection district, but because
they are imported into the United States. The Tariff Act of
1846 prescribes what that duty shall be. Can any reason be
given for the exemption of foreign goods from duty because
they have not been entered and collected at a port of delivery?
The last become a part of the consumption of the country, as
well as the others. They may be carried from the point 6f
landing into collection districts within which duties have been
paid upon the same kinds of goods; thus entering, by the retail
sale of them, into competition with such goods, and with our
own manufactures, and the products of our own farmers and
planters. The right claimed to land foreign goods within the
United States at any place out of a collecticn district, if allowed,
would be a violation of that provision in the Constitution which
enjoins that all duties, imposts, and excises, shall be uniform
throughout the United States. Indeed, it must be very clear
that no such right exists, and that there was nothing in the
condition of California to exempt'importers of foreign goods
into it from the payment of the same duties which were chargeable in the other ports of the United States. As to the denial
of the- authority of the President to prevent the landing of foreign goods in the United States out of a collection district, it
can only be necessary to say, if he did not do so, it would be a
neglect of his constitutional obligation "to take care that the
laws be faithfully executed."
We will here briefly notice those objections which preceded
that which has been discussed. The fist of them, rather an
assertion than an argument-that there was neither treaty nor
law permitting the collection of duties - has been answered, it
having been shown that the ratifications of the treaty made
California a part of the United States, and that as soon as it
became so, the territory became subject to the acts which were
in force to regulate foreign commerce with the United States,
after those had ceased which had been instituted for its regulation as a belligerent right.
The second objection states a proposition larger than the case

admits, and more so than the principle is, which secures to the
inhabitants of a ceded conquest the enjoyment of what had
been their laws before, until they have been changed by the
new sovereignty to which it has been transferred. In this case,
foreign trade had been changed in virtue of a belligerent right
before the territory was ceded as a conquest, and after that had
been done by a treaty of peace, the inhabitants were not remitted to those regulations of trade under which it was carried
on whilst they were under Mexican rule; because they had
passed from that sovereignty to another, whose privilege it was
to permit the existing regulations of trade to continue, and by
wvhich" only they could be changed. \Ve have said in a previous part of this opinion, that the sovereignty of a nation regrulated trade with foreign nations, and that none could be carried
on except as the sovereignty permits it to be done. In our
situation, that sovereignty is the constitutional delegation to
Congress of the power "to regulate commerce with foreign
nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian
tribes."
In respect to the suggestion that it has not been the practice
of the United States to collect duties upon importations of
foreign goods into a ceded territory until Congress had passed
an act for that purpose, counsel cited the cases of Louisiana
and Florida. The reply is, that the facts in respect to both
have not been recollected. There was no forbearance in either
instance, in respect to duties upon imports, until Congress had
acted. Louisiana was ceded by a treaty bearing the date of
the 30th of April, 1803, but the, possession of it by the United
States depended upon the terms of final ratifications by the
parties to it, and upon the delivery of it by a commissioner to
be appointed by tie French government to rcceive the transfer
from Spain to France, and by him to be immediately transfelTed to the United States. Articles 1, 2, 4, 5.
The surrender from Spain to France was formally made on
30th of November, 1S03, and that to the United States was
done oil the 20th of December, 1803. It was known in Washington, by a letter from the commissioner appointed to receive
it, early in January. It is said, that from that time until the
act-of the 24th of February, or, as was provided for in the act,
until thirty days after, Louisiana was not considered, in a
fiscal sense, as a part of the United States; and that duties
were not only not collected by the United States on importations into Louisiana, but that duties were charged on goods
brought from Louisiana into the United States. It seems to
have been forgotten that our commercial intercourse with Louisiana had been the subject of legislation by Congress in several

SUPREME

particulars from the year 1800; and thE.t before the revenue
system could be applied, it was necessary to repeal that special
legislatiofi. Mr. Gallatin, in his report of the 25th of October,
1803, (American State Papers, Finance, vol. 2, 48,) suggested
that it should be done. Congress, however, did not do so until
the act of the 24th of February, 1804, was passed, by the third
section of which the repeal was effected. The postponement
of the operation of the act for thirty days longer, was with the
view to prevent any conflict of rights or interests between what
would be the new regulations of commerce under the act, and
those which had preceded them.
It is only necessary to say as to Florida, that the treaty of
the -2d February, 1819, was not ratified by the United States
until the 19th February, 1821. In a few days afterward the act
was passed extending our revenue system to it, subject to the
stipulation in the 15th article of the treaty in favor of Spanish
vessels and their cargoes. There was, then, no interval in
either instance where duties were not collected upon foreign
importations, because Congress had not legislated for it to be
done.
The application of the revenue acts to North Carolina and
Rhode Island, when those States had ratified the Constitution
of the United States, though that was not done until the Constitution had been ratified by eleven of. the States, does not
support the position taken by the counsel of the plaintiff in
error. Those States had been parties to the Confederation, and
North Carolina was represented in the convention which formed
the Constitution. It was to become the government of the
Union when ratified by nine States. It had been ratified by
eleven States, and Congress declared that it should go into operation on the 4th day of March, 1789. The subsequent ratifications by North Carolina and Rhode Island made them parties
in the government. It brought them in, without new forms or
legislation, and their senators and representatives were admitted
into Congress upon the presentation of their ratifications. Special acts were passed to apply to them the previous legislation
of Congress, and that of the revenue acts, as a matter of course,
because, previously to the ratification, th'bse States had not
been attached to any collection district. But it was not supposed by any one that after those States had ratified the Constitution, ihat foreign goods could have been imported into
them without being subject to duty, or that it was necessary to
make them collection districts to make such importations dutiable.
But we do not hesitate to say, if the reasons given for our
conclusions in this case were not sound, that other considera-

tions would bring us to the same results. The plaintiffs carried
these goods voluntarily into California, knowing the state of
things there. They knew that there -was an existing civil
government instituted by the authority of the President, as commander-in-chief of the army and naval forces of the United
States, by the right of conquest; that it had not ceased when
these first importations were made; that it/was afterwards continued, and rightfully, as we have said, until California became
a State; that they were not coerced to land their goods, however they may have been to pay duties upon them; that such
duties were demanded by those who claimed the right to represent the United States - who did so, in fact, with most commendable integrity and intelligence; that the money collected
has been faithfully accounted for, and the unspent residue of it
received into the treasury of the United States; and that the
Congress has by two acts adopted and ratified all the acts of
the government established in California upon the conquest of
that territory, relative to the collection of imposts and tonnage
from the commencement of the late war with Mexico to the
12th November, 1849, expressly including in such adoption the
moneys raised and expended during that period for the support
of the actual government of California after the ratification
of the treaty of peace with Mexico. This adoption sanctions
what the defendant did. It does more -it
affirms that he had
legal authority for his acts. It coih-cides with the views which
we have expressed in respect to the legal liability of the plaintiffs for the duties paid by them, and the authority of the defendant to receive them as collector of the port of San Francisco.
From these circumstances the law will not imply an assumnpsit upon the part of the defendant to repay the money received
by him from them for duties; the plaintiffs knew, when they
paid him, that the defendant received them for the United
States. The plaintiffs have no claim for damages against the
defendant in justice or equity. They paid duties to which the
United States had a rightful claim, and no more than the law
required. The plaintiffs have paid no excess. The moneys
were paid under no deceit, no mistake; the defendant has
honestly paid them over to the United States, has been recognized as their agent when he acted as collector, and is not responsible to the plaintiffs in foro conscientie. The moneys were
paid from a portion of the funds in the treasury of the United
States, znbjeet to the constitutional restriction that no nioney
shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law for such purposes as the Constitutioln permits. Our conclusion is, that the rulings made in this case in
