No equitable and inchoate title to- land in- Missouri, c.rising under the treaty with
France, can be tried in the State Court.
The Act of Congress, passed on the 2d of larch, 1807, ."2 St. at Large, 440.) did not
proprio vigore vest the legal title in any claimants; for it required the favorable decision of the Commissioner, and then a patent before the title was complete.
The Act of 12th April, 1814, (3 St. at Large, 121,) confirmed those claims only which
had been rejected by the Recorder upon the ground that the land was not ihhabited
by the claimant on the 20th of December, 1803.
Where it did not appear by the report of the Recorder tLat a claim was rejected upon
this specific ground, this act did not confirm it.
The question whether or not the Recorder committed an error in point of fact, was
not open in the State Court of Mlissouri upon a trial of the legal title.
The mere possession of the public land, without title, for any time, however long, will
not enable a party to maintain a suit against any one who enters upon it; and
more especially against a person who derives his title from, the United States.

THIS case was brought up from the Supreme Court of- the
State of Missouri, by a writ of error issued under the 25th sec-

tion of.the Judiciary Act.
The facts of the case are stated in the opinion of the court.
It was arguea by Mr. Garland,for the plaintiff in error, and
by .Tir. Darby, for the defendants in error. 111'r. Garland laid
down the three following propositions : First Proposition. This claim was conirmed by the 2d sect.
of the act 3d of Mlarch, 1807, which is in these words:
" That any person, or persons, and the legal representative of
any person or persons, who, on the twentieth day of December,
one thousand eight hundred and three, had, for ten consecutive
years, prior to that day, been i- possession of a tract of land not
claimed by any other person, and not excaeding two thousand
acres, and who were on that day residing in the territory of Orleans, or Louisiana, and had still possession of such tract of land,
shall be confirmed in their titles to such tract of laid: Provided,
thatno claim to a lead mine or salt spring shall be confirmed
merely by virtue of this section: And provided also, that no
more land shall be granted by virtue of this section than is
actiu.ally claimed by the party, nor mor- than is contained
within the acknowledged and ascertained boundaries of the tract
claimed."
The Supreme Court of Missouri, commenting on this section

say: "The words which declare that a certain class of claims
9shall be confirmed,' are only a direction to the board of commissioners to confirm the- claims which may be brought within
the class of evidence produced before them, and by no means
import a present confirmation, by direct action of Congress upon
the claims."
Whether the words in this section are merely directory I will
hereafter examine, but that this may import a present confirmation has been decided by this court. In Rutherford v. Greene's
Heirs, 2 Wheat. 196, it is so decided. The Legislature of North
Carolina had made a donation of land to General Nathaniel
Greene, in these words: "Be it enacted that 25,000 acres of land
shall be allotted for, and given to, Major-General Nathaniel
Greene, his heirs and assigns, within the bounds of the lands
reserved for the use of the army, to be laid off by the aforesaid
commissioners."
On the part of the appellant it is contended, say the court, that
these words give nothing; they are in the future, not fi, the present tense, and indicate an intention to give in future, but create no present obligation on the State, nor present interest in
General Greene. The court thinks differently. The words are
words of absolute donation, not, indeed, of any special land, but
of 25,000 acres in the territory set apart for the officers and sol.

diers.
in future, the words directing it are necessarily in the future
tense. -- " Twenty-five thousand acres of land shall be allotted
for, and given to, Major-General Nathaniel Greene." Given
when? The answer is unavoidable- when they shall be allotted. Given how? Not by any further act., for it is not the practice of legislation to enact, that a law shall be passed by some
future legislature, but given by force of this act. It has been,
said, that to make this an operative gift, the words "are hereby"
should have been inserted before the word "giv.en," so as to read,
"shall be allotted for, and are hereby given to, &c.11 Were it
even true that these words would make the gift more explicit,
which it is not admitted, it surely cannot be necessary now to
,say that the validity of a legislative act depends, in no degree,
on its containing the technical terms usual in a conveyance.
Nothing can be more apparent than the intention of the legislature to order their commissioners to make the allotment and to
give the land, when allotted, to General Greene.
The allott1 ent and survey marked out the land given by the act,
and separated it from the general map liable to appropriation
by others. The general gift of 25,000 acres lying in the territory reserved for the officers and soldiers of the line of North

Carolina, had now become a particular gift of 25,000 acres con.
tained in this survey."
In the treaty with Spain ceding the Fioridas, the 8th article
says: "All the grants of land made before the 25th January,
1818, &c., shall be ratified and confirmed." The counterpart,
in the Spanish language, rightly translated, reads thus: " Shall
remain ratified and confirmed." This court, commenting on fhese
say: "Alwords, in the United States v. Perchman, 7 Pet. g9,
though the words, 'shall be ratified and confirmed,' are properly the words of contract, stipulating for some future legisla.
tive act, they are not necessarily so. "They may import that
they ' shall be rati'fied and confirmed' by force of the instrument
itself. When we observe that in the counterpart of the same
treaty, executed at the same time, by the same parties, they are
used in this sense, we think the construction proper, if not
unavoidable."
Here are two important cases decided by this court, in which
the words, "shall be given," and the words, "shall be confirmed,"
are construed into a present grant and confirmation, by force of
the instrument itself.
Let us now see whether such is not thE true construction of
the statute before us. The Supreme Court of Missouri say that
the words, "shall be confirmed," are only a direction to the board
of commissioners. The act of 2d March, 1805, created a board
of'commissioners to decide on claims to land in Louisiana. The
1st and 2d sections prescribed the character of claims to be acted
on, and the kind of evidence to be given in their support. The
supplemental act of April 21st. 1806, modified the evidence to
be given. The decision of the board amounted only to a recommendation to Congress. These statutes, and the restrictions in
them, giving much dissatisfaction, Congress passed the 4th sec.
tion of the act of March 3d, 1807, in which they conferred on the
board of commissioners full powers to decide, according to the
laws and established usages and customs of the French and
Spanish governments, upon all claims to lands, where the
claim is made by any persons who were, on the 20th of December, 1803, inhabitants of Louisiana, and for a tract not exceeding the quantity of acres contained in a leagae square, and which
does not include either a lead mine, or salt springs; which decisipn, when in favor of the claimant, shall be final against the
United States.
Here we see power conferred on the board to decide, according to the laws and established usages and customs of the
French and Spanish governments. They were restricted to
claims coming under those laws and usages, and what might
be those laws and usages they had full power to determine.

DECEMBER TERM,

Burgess v. Gray et al.

Now the claims embraced in the second section of the same act,
do not necessarily fall under this head; if they do, then the second
section was superfluous; the board having full power, under
the fourth section, to decide such claims as are described in the
second. But that the subject-matter of the second section was
not intended to be referred to the board, is made plain by the
eighth section, which sa.ys that the commissioners shall report to
the Secretary of the Treasury, their opinion on all the claims to
land, which they shall not have finally confirmed by the fourth
section of this act.
If the law had intended that they should act on claims in the
second section, that section would have been included in the
above clause, and it would read, "shall not have finally confirmed by the second and fourth section of this act." The
report would be in these words: The commissioners would
have confirmed such dnd such a claim, by virtue of the second
section of the act of March, 1807, but for such and such defects.
This was generally the style of their negative reports. But we
see that the claims under the second section, were not subjects
on which they were authorized to report adversely upon; of
course they were not subjects dn which they would act at all.
Again, the second section makes no allusion to the claims
therein described, being recognized and valid by the laws and
usages of the country; on the contrary, we are bound to infer
that Congress did not consider them as so recognized, and
therefore singled them out as the special objects of their bounty.
There were but two classes of claims recognized by the Spanish; both were described by the first and second sections of
the act of 2d of March, 1805. The first was some written evidence of title, a concession or warrant, or order of survey; the
second was a mere verbal permission
occupy and cultivate,
hence it was called a " Settlement Right."
Now, the claims in the second section cannot come under
the head of " Settlement Rights." A settlement right could not
exceed eight hundred arpens, and required inhabitation and
cultivation to give it validity. The claims under the second
section largely exceed the quantity in a settlement right, and
only required proof of possession, which does not necessarily
involve inhabitation or cultivation. Hence, I conclude that the
subject-matter of the second section, was not intended to be
rteerred to the Board of Commissioners for their action.
Let us now examine the second section in its own terms. If
the claimant was an inhabitant of the territory at the change
of government, and was still in possession at .that time, if the
tract claimed had acknowledged and ascertained boundaries,
not exceeding two thousand acres and not adversely claimed,

SUPREME COURT.
Burgess v. Gray et al.

his title shall be confirmed. If the second section stood by
itself, no one would fail to construe these words into a present
grant, being in all respects similar to the two cases above cited.
If then, the words of the section are suf~cient to create a present grant, it is a forced construction to prevent them from
having that effect, and to throw the confirmation on the future
decision of a Board of Commissioners fcr the reasons already
given. First,if the board had power to act on the subject, the
second section was superfluous. Second, the eighth section
implies an exclusion of the second from the jurisdiction of the
board. Third, the language of the second section, leads us
to presume that the Legislature did'not think that the claims
therein embraced, were recognized by the Spanish laws and
usages, or they would have left them to he decided by the commissioners under their general powers.
The proviso of the second section puts it beyond doubt, that
the claims were intended to be confirmed by force of the act itself.
The proviso says, that no claim to a lead mine or salt spring
shall be confirmed merely by virtue of this section. The necessary inference is, that a tract of land, not containing a lead
mine or salt spring, but in other respects complying with its
terms, shall be confirmed merely by virtue of this section. It
may be sai4, that this proviso was intended as an instruction
to the .Board of Commissioners; but the fourth section, which
confers the powers on the board, and imposes limitations on
them, has this very same prohibition. This affords us good
evidence of the meaning of the Legislature. They did not
intend under any circumstances to confirm a lead mine or a
salt spring; therefore, in the second section, where they intended
to confirm certain claims, merely by force of the- section, they
introduced a proviso exempting lead mines and salt springs
from its operation; and in the fourth section, where full pow.ers
are given to the board to decide all French and Spanish claims,
they introduced a claim imposing the same restriction on them,
in regard to lead mines and salt springs. This is the only way,
in which we can give an independent e--istence to the second
section and preserve it from being a mere superfluity.
There is nothing in the words of the seztion, that necessarily
requires further action on the part of the Legislature or its ministerial agents. All that the claimant wotld have to do, when
his right is brought in question, is to show that he comes within
the proyisions of the statutes, just as the claimants of village
lots under the act of the 13th June, 1812. He will have to
establish his title by showing a tract, not exceeding two thousand acres, with defined and ascertained limits; proving uninterrupted possession for ten consecutivecyears; residence in the

Burgess v. Gray et al.

province and possession at the time of the change of government. These facts would work a title in him, having relation
back to the time of the passage of the act.
Second Proposition. The next statute on which we rely for a
confirmation, is the second section of the act passed April 12,
1814, entitled "An act for the final adjustment of land titles
in the State of Louisiana and Territory of Missouri."
(The argument of ."JIr. Garland,upon this proposition, is too
long to be inserted.)
Third Proposition. If the court are not sat-sfied, that the
claim of John Jarrott was confirmed by the acts we have been
commenting on, there is another view of the case, to which I
would now ask their attention.
By the facts set forth in the petition, and admitted to be true
by the demurrer, it seems that Jarrott had been in possession of
the land more than ten consecutive years prior to the 20th December, 1803; that it did not exceed in quantity two thousand
acres, and that he was an inhabitant of the territory, and still
in possession on that day. By the second section of the act 3d
March, 1807, he was entitled to a confirmation from any triliunal authorized to act on the subject. The claim was presented to the Recorder of Land Titles, and by him rejected, it was
reserved from sale by the act of 17th February, 1818, third section.
It was afterwards surveyed and marked on the books of the Surveyor General and on the books of the Register, as reserved to
fill the claim of John Jarrott. In 1824 an act was passed authorizing the representatives of certain French and Spanish claims
to prosecute them before the District Court. Various other acts
were subsequently passed on these claims which it is not necessary to mention. On the 17th June, 1844, an act was passed
reviving for five years the act of 1824.
The claim of John Jarrott did not come within the purview
of these statutes. The act of 26th May, 1824, gave jurisdiction
to the District Court over claims to lands, "by virtue of any
French or Spanish grant, concession, warrant or order of survey
legally made, granted, or issued before the 10th day of March,
1804," by the proper authorities. Jarrott's claim was neither a
grant, a concession, a warrant, or order of survey; it was founded on verbal permission only, and was called a settlement right;
as such it was filed, and as such it was acted on by the Recorder.
That it did not come under the jurisdiction of the court, is put
beyond question by a comparison of other statutes on the same
subject. On the 9th of July, 1832, an act was passed creating a
Board of Commissioners "to examine all the unconfirmed claims
to laDd in that State, (illssouri,) heretofore filed in the office of
the Recorder according to law, founded upon any incomplete
5-it

SUPRE21E COURT.
Burgess v. Gray, et al.

grant, concession, warrant, or order of survey, issued by the
authority of France or Spain, prior to the 10th day of March,
1804." It will b.e perceived that the class of claims embraced in
this statute is precisely the same as that in the act of 1824, over
which the District Court took cognizance. They were claims
originating in a grant, concession, warrant, or order of survey.
Donation or settlement claims were not embraced; accordingly
Congress passed a supplemental act embracing those claims.
On the 2d of March, 1833, it was enacted that the provisions
of the act of the 9th of July, 1832, shall be extended to, and embrace in its operations every claim to a donation of land in the
State of Missouri, held in virtue of settlement and cultivation.
This supplement shows the understanding of the Legislature,
and proves that Jarrott's claim, which was a "donation-right,"
was not embraced by the act of 9th of July, 1832, and consequently not by the act of 26th May, 1824, giving jurisdiction to
the court, to precisely the same class of claims.
Since writing the above, I have seen the opinion of this court
in the case of the United States v. Rilleux, 14 Howard, 18,
which fully sustains the conclusion that the District Court had
no jurisdiction in this case.
After the act of 1818, reserving this tract from sale, there
was no other statute operating*on it till the supplemental act oI
March, 1833, extending the provisions of the act of 1832, to donation and settlement rights. It was made the duty of the Commissioners to examine all the unconfirmed claims heretofore
filed in the office of the Recorder, to take additional testimony, if
they thought proper, in regard to those claims, and then to class
them so as to show, first, what claims, in their opinion, would
in fact have been confirmed under formEr authorities, and, secondly, what claims, in their opinion, are destitute of merit.
They were required to proceed, with or -ithout any new application of the claimants, and to lay before the Commissioners
of the General Land Office a report of the claims so classed, to
be laid before Congress for their final decision upon the claims
contained in the first class.
The third section then enacts, "that from and after the final
report of the Recorder and Commissioners, the lands contained
in the second class shall be subject to sale as other public lands,
and the lands contained in the first class shall continue to be
reserved from sale as heretofore, until the decision of Congress
sliall be made thereon." Jarrott's claim was not embraced in
either class, it was not acted on at all. ThE law made it the duty
of the Board tp proceed without further application. The claim
was regularly filed in the office of the Recorder; the Commissioners might take additional testimony if the case required it. The

representatives of Jarrott had nothing to do; they could only
wait in silence the action of the board. Their claim was overlooked or not reached; the board made their final report, and
dissolved. Now, it is a well settled principle of law that no
person shall suffer in his rights in consequence of the delay
or neglect of government officers. This tract of land stands
reserved from sale, as heretofore, to fill the claim of John Jarrott's representatives.
In Menard v. Massey, 8 Howard, 309, this court have said:
"That this provision (section 6th of act 3d March, 1811,) is an
exception to the general powers conferred on the officers to sell,
is not an open question; having been so adjudged by this court
in the ease of Stoddard's Heirs v. Chambers, reported in2 Htoward; and again, at the present term, in the case of Bissell v. Penrose. Nor is it an open question, that the act of February 17,
1818, folio 3, reenacts and continues in force the exception as
respects such lands. This was also decided by the above cases;
and that such was the opinion of Congress, is manifest from
the third section of the act of 9th July, 1832, under which the
last Board acted; for it declares that lands of the first class shall
be reserved from sale as heretofore." Now it is manifest that
lands not classed at all, not acted on by the Board, must continue reserved from sale as heretofore. We can come to no
other conclusion without admitting that the neglect or delay
of public officers can deprive a person of his rights, which is not
consistent with law or justice.
The Supreme Court of Missouri, in a similar case, have held
that the lands continue to be reserved as heretofore. In Perry
v. O'Hanlon, 11 Mo. 596, they say: "W hat then was the
condition of the land, the title to which is now in controversy,
in 1847, when the patent issued? The act of July 9th, 1832,
dhected the Commissioners to divide the claims submitted to
them into two classes. The first class was to embrace such
claims as, in their opinion, were meritorious and ought to be
confirmed; and the second class, to include such as were destitute of merit. The act declared that, after the-final report of
the Board, the lands embraced in the second class should be subject to sale as other public lands; that the lands contained in
the first class should be reserved from sale until the final action
of Congress thereon. Congress finally acted on this report in
1836; and the act, July 4, 1886, confirmed the claims recommended by the Commissioners, with certain exceptions specified
in the act. Perry's claim was not in the second class, for it was
never rejected by the Board; it was not in the first class, for it
not reported for contirmation. How then has the reservav
tion been removed ? By the act of 1832, this land was expressly

SUPREME

COURT.

reservcd from sale. No proceeding under that act has had the
effect of taking off this reservatibn, nor has any subsequent law
been dnacted having such purpose or tendency. If Perry, then,
by virtue of the proceedings under the proviso to the third section, failed to acquire a complete title to the land by purchase,
it still continues wider the general reservation. Whether Perry's title be good or other-wise, until Congress shall direct the
land to be brought intq market, no other individual, can acquire
a title. It was expressly reserved on account of Perry's claim

tract ofThat
land, therefore, stands reserved from sale "as
heretofore," and all the entries made upon it are consequently
void. But' the Supreme Cout of Missouri tell us there is no
remedy. ".Supp6s. it be true;" say they, "that the reservation
did exist, and that its effect would be to render the purchases
void, still his position (plaintiff's) .iii court is not changed thereby. The reservation confers no title on :ain.; and the nullity
of puxchases made by the defendants does not enhance the
merits of his tfile. He is still without any title that we can
enforce."
They came to 'this conclusion on the authority of cases decided -by this court. " The Supreme Court of the United
States," say they, in Les Bois v. Bramell, 4 Howard, 462, and
Ji Menard v, Massey, 8 Howard, 307, "distinctly declare that
until an -inchoate title originating under the Spanish government has been ' confirmed,' it has no standing in a court of law
or equity."
In the view I am now about. to press upon the consideration
'of the court, I do not restothe case on the' "unconfirmed title"
filed In the Recorder's office. The above authorities, therefore,
and the principle deduced from them, are inapplicable.
I maintain, that we have a right to the aid' of the court on
the ground of possession; legal possessicn of a tract of land
*with ackiowledged and. ascertained boundarihs, by permission
and, aut4iority of the Congress of the United States. We are
tenants of the government, and have a right to be protected in
our Vossession.
The statute of Missouri says: "The action of ejectment may
be maintained in all cases where the plaintiff is legally entitled
to -the possession of the premises."
In this case, Burgess, as representative of Jarrott, is legally
entitled to the possession of the premises.
Kendall, who purchased of Jarrott's heirs, filed his claim with
the Recorder under the seventh section of the act 13th June, 1812,
which required. him to be an actual settler .on the land. As the
claim was not edfirmed on other grounds we are to presume

DECEMBER

TER.M,

57

Burgess v. Gray et al.

that he complied with the law in this respect, and was an-actual
settler. We know, from the record, he was. The land thus 'actually settled was reserved from sale by a subsequent act of
Congress. It was surveyed and marked on the book of surveys,
in the Register's office, as reserved from sale, to fill the claim of
John Jarrott's representative. This representative was in the
actual occupation and use of the land. Here, then, is a specific
tract of land in the actual occupation of Kendall, who has authority by law to hold the same until Congress shall determine
whether or not he has a right to demand a legal title for it. Until
that event he has possession, and a legal right to the possession.
Burgess, in his petition, sets out his possession and the ouster
of possession by the defendants. After describing the chain of
events, and proving himself the legal representative of John Jarrott, the petition then proceeds: "And your petitioner has
been in possession of six hundred and forty acres of said land
ever since he purchased it as aforesaid."
The petition goes on to show that the land was marked on
the books as reserved from sale, and was reserved from sale to
fill.
the claim of Jarrott's representatives, "until the 30th day
of December, 1847, a period of venty-nine or thirty years, when,
in violation of law, the several acts of the Congress of the United States, and the rights of the legal representatives of the said
Jarrott," the Register suffered prUemptions to be taken on it;
"and the persons who took said pri:emptions had full knowledge at the time of the claim of John Jarrott's legal representatives to said land, and now having possession of said land, and
claiming the same as their property, (although attempted to be
unlawfully obtained,) and are keeping the legal representatives
of the said Jarrott out of their possession of the same, notwithstanding it is their property, and belongs to no other person
whatever." And, in conclusion, the petition prays "that said
defendants be, by verdict and judgment in your petitioner's behalf, compelled to abandon their illegal claim to said land or
any part of it: to wit, your petitioner's six hundred and forty
acres of it."
This petition is awkwardly worded, but the statute of Missouri requires no particular form, only that the petitioner shall
set out his case in full, and in language so that a man of common understanding shall know what is meant. There can be
no mistake as to the meaning of this petition. Burgess had
bought six hundred and forty acres of this land by deed, and
was in the actual possession of the same, according to the metes
and bounds of his deed, when the -defendants intruded and unlawfully obtained possession, and are holding the same against
the lawful possession of him, the legal representative of John

58

SUPREME

COURT.
Gray et al.

Jarrott, and he prays that they may be adjudged to surrender
up this unlawful claim to his land.
It is on this right of possession we now ask the judgment of
the court.
That the entries are void, cannot be questioned. See Stoddard's Heirs v. Chambers, 2 Howard 284: Menard v.Massey,
and Bissell v., Penrose, 8 Howard; and Perry v. O'Hanlon, 11
Missouri, 585. The entries being void, our right of possession
will be recognized and enforced.
The political power has acted on this claim, and it is now
cognizable by the courts of law. The claim was required by
statute to be filed with the Recorder of Land Titles; to be investigated and reported to Congress. Another statute declares that
until the final action of Congress thereon it shall be reserved
from sale. The executive officers are insiructed to carry these
laws into effect. The Surveyor-General marks it out on the
maps iii his office; draws lines around the 'claim, and writes on
the face of it, "Reserved from sale, to fill the claim of John
.arrott's representatives." Will not the courts recognize a claim
in this condition, and enforce the law in regard to it? They do
not look upon it as an unconfirmed Spardsh grant, having no
standing in a court, bNt as a claim filed -and reserved from sale
by the laws of Congress: it has a legal existence. They.enforce
the laWs of Congress and say: The possession of Jarrott's repre.
sentatives is recognized by statute, and is valid until the final
action of Congress: in the mean time all entries on this land are
-without authority and void. The Supreme Court of Missouri
admit that they have power to pronounce the entry of the defendants void, because the land is reserved from sale by a law
of Congress; but deny that they can go further, and protect the
right of possession in the plaintiff, because he sets up nothing
more than an unconfirmed Spanish grant which is not recognized by law. But he dces more, he sets up a right of possession in this land under the law of Congress. It is admitted th-t
the plaintiff is in possession, and has been from the beginning.
It must also be conceded that the reservation was made in
respect of this possession, because every law on the subject of
incomplete Spanish grants is based on the idea of actual possession or inhabitation and cultivation. This reasoning is specially applicable to the present case, because it has no written
evidence of title; and rests entirely on actual settlement or possession. Here then is a claim founded in possession, only,
recognized by law. If,therefore, the courts can protect the
reservation by declaring 4 entries on it, subsequent to the reservation, void, they can likewise protect and enforce the right
of possession on which the reservation was founded. The same

law that gives them power to protect the reservation, gives them
power to protect the possession under it. If this be not so, then
a bond fide holder of land under the authority of Congress can
be ousted of his possession, and the courts have no power to
protect him. But this is not law. An ejectment can be maintained on a bare possession against a trespasser. In the case
of Crockett v. Morrison, 11 Mo. page 6, the court say: "As
the action of ejectment is a possessory action, where no title
appears on either side, a prior possession, though short of twenty
years, will prevail over a subsequent possession which has not
ripened into a title, provided the prior possession be under a
claim of right and not voluntarily abandoned ...........
This doctrine is recognized by the New York courts in a variety

In all these cases it will be found
that the defendants, against whom a recovery was permitted,
were mere trespassers, and that they or those under whom
they claimed, or from whom they obtained possession, entered
upon the actual or constructive possession of the plaintiff."
In the present case there is no question of title: that remains
in the United States. The Supreme Court of Missouri admit
that Burgess is in possession, and that the entry of the defendants is void. Then the defendants are mere trespassers on the
actual and constructive possession of the plaintiff, and ought to
be ejected by the present action.

.Mr. Darby, for defendants in error.
The petition of the plaintiff shows that he. has no title. His
claim is not based upon a concession, and was never confirmed.
The only action ever taken with the claim by the parties purporting to represent it, was when it was presented to the Recorder
of Land Titles, by Kendall, after his purchase in 1812. The
Recorder refused to recommend it for confirmation, and rejected
it; and from that time to the commencement of this suit, a
period of nearly forty years, the claim appears to have been
abandoned. At least, no steps appear to have been taken to
bring it before the Recorder, or any of the several boards of
commissioners, for confirmation. It does not appear to have
been presented to Congress, or any department bf the government or other tribunal, for their sanction, approval, or conirmation.
The opinion of the Supreme Court of Missouri has shown,
most conclusively, that it was not confirmed by the second section of the act of the 3d of March, 1807, (2 U. S. Stat. at Large,
440,) as was contended by the counsel in that court, in the argument of this cause.
The plaintif, then, has nothing more than an unconfirmed,

unprosecuted claim to landwhich has been rejected by the Recorder of Land Titles, and that rejection acquieseed in for nearly
forty years; and which thie defendants, as shown by the plaintiff's petition, have purchased, at different times, of the United
States, and to which they have severally a title from the govern.
ment. It is. manifest the plaintiff has no such title as will
authorize a court of justice to give him the relief prayed for in
his petition.
The claim was not filed under the provisions of the act of
Congress of May 26, 1824, giving jurisdiction to the District
Court of the United States for the Missouri District, to adjudicate and pass, on these unconfirmed claims. The claim was
consequently barred. The fifth section of that act provides,
" That -any claim not brought before the District Court within
two years -from the passing thereof, shall be forever barred, both
in law and equity; and that no other action at common law, or
proceeding in equity, shall ever thereafter be sustained in relation to said claim."
In further support of this position, the defendants refer to the
case of Barry 1. Gamble, 3 How. 55, and also. to the case of
Chouteau v. Eckhart 2 How. 352.
To show, moreover, that the plaintiff's claim has "no standing in a court of law or equity," the defendants rely with much
confidence on the case of Les Bois v. Bramell, decided in this
court at the January term, 1846, 4 How. 462. And in the case
of Menard v.Massy, 8 How. 307, the same principle is still more
strongly asserted and adhered to.
The decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri is made in
accordance with the decisions referred to, and is governed by
them. The demurrers -were rightfully sustained on both points.
The defendants were improperly joined in the action. They
held separately, each in his own right, und.er entries made at the
Land office at different timues, and under pregmptions allowed in
favor of each of the defendants. The peition shows that they
did not hold or claim title in common, bui- that they held sepa,

rately.
In conclusion; the defendants adopt, as a part of their argurnent, a portion of the able opinion of Chief Justice Gamble, in
delivering the opinion in this cause:
"Tie plaintiff, then, has no title which authorizes him to ask
the relief prayed for in this petition. But he alleges that the
land was, by different acts of Congress, reserved from sale in
order to satisfy his claim, and therefore th- purchases made. by
the defendants were void. Suppose it to be true that the reservation did. existi and that its effect would be to render the
purchases void, still hiq position in court is not changed there-

by. The reservation confers no title oa him, and the nullity
of purchases made by the defendants does not enhance the
merits of his title. He is still without any title that he can
enforce."
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This was a suit brought by petition in the Circuit Court of
Jefferson county, in the State of Missouri, by the plaintiff in
error, against the defendants.
" The petition sets forth, in substance, that John Jarrott, alias
Gerrard, in 1780, with the consent and permission of the officers
of the Spanish government, settled upon a tract of land in what
is now Jefferson county, in the State of Missouri, and that he
continued to inhabit and cultivate it until about 1796, when he
was driven -off by the Indians. His son Joseph succeeded him
in the possession of the land, and continued to reside upon and
cultivate it until he sold it to Kendall, in the year 1812. Kendall fih d a notice of the claim with the United States Recorder
of Land Titles, who rejected it. The right of Kendall passed by
descent to his heirs at law, who sold to the plaintiff, as appears
by conveyances filed with the petition. It appears, moreover,
that the plaintiff has always been in possession since the purchase of Kendall's heirs. A plat of the claim was laid down on
the maps of the public lands, in the Registrar's office, representing it as being reserved to satisfy the claim of John Jarrott's
legal representatives. After the claim had been examined and
rejected by the Recorder of Land .Titles,no farther action appears
to have been taken on the claim.
".,In the years 1847 - 8, and 9, different portions of the same tract
of land were entered at the Registraxs office, by differei~t individuals, under pre~mptions allowed to them; the entries being
made at different times, each person purchasing in his own right
and in his own individual name, separate and distinct from the
others, The several persons making these separate and different
entries are made the defendants to this suit.
"aThe defendants demurred ft the petition, and assigned as
causes of demurrer: first, thp.' the plaintiff showed no right, in
his petition, to maintain the action; second, that separate and
distinct causes of action alainst different persons were joined
in the petition.
" The Circuit Court- of Jefferson County, sustained the demurrers, and the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of
of Missouri. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the
Circuit Court, and the plaintiff has brought his case before this
court, by writ of error, to reverse the decision of the Supreme
Court of Missouri."

SUPREME

COURT.

Burgess v. Gray et al.

In proceeding to deliver the opinion of the court, it is proper
to observe, that by the laws of Missouri the distinction between
suits at law and in equity has been abolished. The party proceeds by petition, stating fully the facts on which he relies, if
he seeks to recover possession of land to which he claims a perfect legal title; and he proceeds in -the saihe manner if he desires to obtain an injunction to quiet him in his possession, or to
compel the adverse party to deliver up to be cancelled evidences
of title, improperly and illegally obtained, and he may, it seems,
assert both legal and equitable rights in the same proceeding,
and obtain the appropriate judgment.
This has beei done by the plaintiff in error in the present
case. His suit is brought according to the prayer of his petiti6n
to recover possession of land to which he claims title, and upon
which, as he alleges, the defendants have unlawfully entered;
and also to compel them to abandon (as he terms it) their illegal
claim.
The demurrer admits the truth of the facts stated in the petition. And, consequently, if these facts show that he had any
legal or equitable right to the land in question under the treaty
with France, or an act of Congress, which the State court was
authorized and bound to protect and 'enforce, he is entitled to
maintain this writ of error, and the judgment of the State court
must be reversed.
N9ow as regards any equitable and inchoate title which the
petitioner may possess under the treaty w.th France, it is quite
clear that the State court Lad no jurisdiction over it. For it
has been repeatedly held by this court thati under that treaty, no
inchoate and imperfect title derived from the French or Spanish
authorities can be maintained in a court of justice, unless jurisdiction to try and decide it has first been conferred by act of
Congress. Certainly no such jurisdiction has been given to any
State court. And the Supreme Court of Missouri were right
in sustaining the demurrer, as to.this par; of the petition, even
had been of opinion, that the permit to settle on the land,
if .it
and the long possession of it under the Spanish government,
gave him an equitable right, by the laws of Spain, to demand a
perfect and legal title. The court had no jurisdiction upon the
question. And the judgment of the Sta;e court cannot be reversed unless the plaintiff can "showthat he had a complete and
perfect title derived from the Spanish or French authorities: or
a legal or tquitable title under the laws of the United States.
The petitioner does not claim a perfect grant from the French
or Spanish goiernment; nor a pafent from the proper officers
of the United States. But he insists that the act of Congress
of March 3, 1807, 2.4 Stat.440, vested-in..him a complete legal
title, and needed no patent to confirm it.

DECEMBER TERA,

1853.

Burgess v. Gray et al.

Undoubtedly Congress may, if it thinks proper, grant a title
in that form, and it has repeatedly done so. And we proceed
to exanine whether the title, claimed by the plaintiff, was confirmed to him by the act. referred to.
The plaintiff relies on the second section as a confirmation of
his claim. But it evidently will not bear that construction when
taken in connection with the whole act. For the fourth section
directed commissioners to be appointed, who were authorized to
decide upon all claims to land under French or Spanish titles
in the territories of Louisiana or Orleans; and by the sixth
section, whenever the final decision of the Commissioner was in
favor of the claimant, he -was entitled to a patent for the land,
to be issued. in the manner provided for in that section. The
eighth section required the Commispioners to report to the Secretary of the Treasury their opinion upon all claims not finally
confirmed by them -the claims to be classified in the manner
therein prescribed. And it was made the duty of the Secretary
to lay this report before Congress for their final determination.
This act of Congress did not, proprio vigore vest the legal
title in any of the claimants. For even when the decision of
the Commissioners was final in their favor, yet a patent was still
necessary to convey the title. The report was made coriclusive
evidence of the equitable right, and nothing more. And wben
the final decision was against the validity of the claim, he was
directed to report his opinion upon its merits; and Congress
reserved to itself the ultimate determination.
The powers and duties of the C6mmissioner were subsequently
transferred to the Recorder of Land Titles. And this claim
was presented to him in 1812, with the evidence upon which
the claimant relied to support it. It is a claim under a settlement right derived from the Spanish authorities, and which the
claimant insisted was within the provisions, and entitled to con:
firmation under the second section of the act of 1807.
The Recorder reported against it. His report states that there
was "possession, inhabitation, and cultivation in 1781, and eight
following years, and again two or three years." He assign's no
particular reason for rejecting the claim, but simply enters in
his report "not granted." And in this form it was laid before
Congress, together with the other claims not finally decided by
the Recorder in favor of the claimants. It does not therefore
appear from the report whether it *as rejected because, in, the
judgment of the Recorder, the possess.ion of ten consecutive
years was not sufficiently proved: or because no evidence was
offered (and none appears to have been offered) to prove that
the party under whose title -the claim was made was a resident
of the territory on the 20th of December, 1803.

SUPREME COURT.
Burgess-v. Gray et al.

On behalf of the petitioner it is coritended, that the decision of
the Recorder was erroneous, and founded upon a mistake as to
a matter of fact; and that it appears by the evidence returned
with the report to the Secretary of the Treasury, that the possession spoken of was proved to have been for more than ten
consecutive years before the 20th of December, 1803 - and no"
broken, as stated in the report.
This may be true. The Recorder may have fallen into error.
But, it does not follow that plaintiff wak. entitled, on that account, to maintain his petition in. the Missouri court. That court
had no power to correct the errors of the Recorder if he made
any; nor to revise his decision; nor to confirm a title which he
had rejected. That power, by the act of 1807, was expressly
reserved to Congress itself; and has not been committed even to
the judicial tribunals. of the general government. The decision
of the Recorder against him is final, unless reversed by act of
Congress; and the petitioner can make no title under the United
States, by virtue of the provisions in that act.
It is however insisted that if it was not confirmed by the act
of 1807, it was made valid by the act of 1814. And this
confirmation is claimed under the first sEction, which confirms
all claims where it appe rs by the report of the Recorder that it
was rejected merely because the land was not inhabited by the
December, 1803.
the 20th
claimant
But it isonvery
clear of
that this act does not embrace it. The
report of the Recorder does not place its' rejection merely on
that ground. On thp contrary, it would seem to place it upon
the want of proof of continued residence upon the land for ten
consecutive years; and upon none other.
It may indeed have happened that the son of John Jarrett
was in possession, and actually inhabited the land on the day
mentioned in the law; and that from ignorance of its provisions,
or from other cause, he omitted to produce proof of it to the
Recorder, and that the claim was in fact rejected on that account. But that question was not open to inquiry in the Missouri court. The act of Congress does not confirm all claims
wheke this fact oxisted and could be proved, but those only in
which it appeared on the face of the report that the want of
this proof was the sole cause of its rejection. This must appear
on the written report of the Recorder to bling it within the
provisions of this act, and cannot be supplied by other evidence.
And as it does not so appear in the present case, the act of 1814
does not embrace it nor confirm it.
Neither can the petition be maintained upon the long and%
continued possession held by the petitioner and those under
whom he claims.
The legal title to this land, under the treaty with France, was

in the United States. The defendants are in possession, claiming title from the United States, and with evidences of title
derived from the proper officers of the government. It is not
necessary to inquire whether the title claimed by them is valid
or not. The petitioner, as appears by the case he presents in
his petition, has no title of any description derived from the
constituted authorities of the United States, of which any court
of justice can take cognizance. And the mere possession of
public land, without title, will not enable the party to maintain
a suit against any one who enters on it; and more especially
he cannot maintain it against persons holding possession under
title derived from the proper officers of the government. He
must first show a right in himself, before he can call into question the validity of theirs.
Whatever equity, therefore, the plaintiff may be supposed to
have, it is for the consideration and decision of Congress, and
not for the courts. If he has suffered injury from the mistake
or omission of the public officer, or from his own ignorance of
the law, the power to repair it rests with the political department of the government, and not the judicial. It is expressly
reserved to the former by the act of Congress;
We see no error in the judgment of the Supreme Oourt of
Missouri, and it must be affirmed with costs.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Su -eme Court of the- State of Missouri, and was
argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here
ordered and adjudged by this court., that the judgment of the

JOSIAS PENNINGTON, PLAINTIFF IN ERROi, v. LYiAN GiBsoN,
Whenever the parties to a suit and the subject in controversy between them are within
the regular jurisdiction of a court of equity, the decree of that court is to every
intent as binding as would be the judgment of a court of law.
Whenever, therefore, an action of debt can be maintained upon a~jndgment at law for
a sum of money awarded by such judgment, the like action can be maintained upon
a decree in equity which is for a specific amount i and the records of the two courts
are of equal dignity and binding obligation.
A declaration was sufficient which averred that "at a general term of the Supreme
Court in Equity for the State of New York," &c. &c. Being thus averrtd to be a
court of general jurisdiction, no averment was necessary.that the subject-matter in
question was within its jurisdiction. And the courts of the United States will take
notice of the judicial decjsions in the several States, in the same manner as the
courts of those States.
