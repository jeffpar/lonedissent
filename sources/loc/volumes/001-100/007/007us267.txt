On a subsequent day,
MARSHALL,

Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the

port.
The court has considered this case, and is of opinion
that the jurisdiction cannot be supported.
The words of the act of congress are, "where an
alien is a party ; or the suit is between a'citizen of a
state where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another
state."
The court understands these expressions t.o meaL
that .each distinct interest should b- "represented by persons, all of whom are entitled to sue, or may be sued,
in the federal courits. That is, -that where the Interest
is joint, each of the persons concerned in that interest
musi be competent to sue, or liable to be sued, in
.tlose courts.
But the court does not mean to give anbpinion in the
case where several parties represent several distinct in-

courts of the

to the circuit court of the United, according to the 12th

state of South Carolina. But the court, " after observ.
