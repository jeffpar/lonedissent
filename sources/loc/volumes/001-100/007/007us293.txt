to its being read in evidence; and that the said
Patrick Cavan died before the trial. To the reading
of this deposition, the plaintiff objected, but the court
suffered it to be read.
2. The 2d bill of exceptions stated, that the plaintiff
prayed the court to instruct the jury, that the defendant was not entitled, on the plea of payment, to discount the bonds and notes assigned to the plaintiff, as
mentioned in the deposition of Cavan, unless it should
appear to the jury that the same had been collected by
the plaintiff; which instruction the court refused to
give, but directed the jury, that the deposition was
competent evidence to be offered in proof of a discount
on the plea of payment.
E.

J.

Lee, for the plaintiff in error, contended,

1. That the deposition was irregularly taken, inasmuch as a notice to take a deposition on the 8th, is
not notice to take it on the 19th; and although notice
was given, that if the deposition was not taken on the
8th, the commissioners would adjourn from day to day,
vet in this case, they adjourned over from the 12th to
the 19th, without giving new notice. Besides, the
notice in this case is to the attorney at law, and not to
an attorney in fact. If it be said, that an attorney at
law may bind his client, by an agreement relative to
any matter in the proceedings, or trial of a cause, yet,
the asseht of the attorney only went tQ the taking the
deposition on the 8th of August, and not on any subsequent day.
2. It was not competent for the defendant to prove
that assent, by the testimony of Archibald M'Lain, who
was his guardian of record, and answerable for costs.
3. The matter contained in the deposition, was not
competent evidence upon either of the issues. It certainly was not evidence of a release under seal.; and
the assignment would not be a payment, unless it produced the mon'ey to the plaintiff., If any thing but
money is relied upon as satisfaction of a bond, it must
be pleaded by way of accord and satisfaction. and not

as payment. One bond cannot be pleaded in discharge
of aother, a fortiori cannot an assignment of a bond.
I Burr. 9, Rhodes v. Barnes.
Simms-, for the defendant.
1. If the plaintiff had not notice of the time of taking the deposition, it was his own fault, or that of his
attorney. The attorney, having received and acknowledged notice for the 8th of August, was bound to attend ; and if he had attended, he would, of course, have
had notice of the adjournment. This want of notice'
therefore, is to be attributed to his own negligence.
But if the notice was insufficient, the court, under the
circumstances of the case, did not err in admitting the
deposition. When the plaintiff's attorney rend the deposition, he did not object. By his silence he lulled
the defendant into security, at a time, when, if the objection had been made, he might have corrected the
mistake, by giving new notice, and taking the deposition de novo. But instead of that, he concealed his
objection until the deponent was dead, and when he
knew that the defendant would totally lose the benefit
of his testimony. In such a case the court will say,
that the silence of the attorney, when he read the deposition, was a waiver of the notice.
2. As to the second

objection, that Archibald

M'Lain was not a competent witness, because he was
the guardian of the defendant. It does appear upon
the record, that the witness was the same Archibald
M'Lain, who was the guardian. And besides, it appears, that before the trial the defendant himself was
of age, and had leave to appear by attorney.
S. As to the objection, that the matter of the depo,sition was not competent evidence on the issues. The
court did not say it was complete'proof of payment,
but that it was matter proper to be left to the jury upon
the plea of payment, and from which a paynient might
be infcrred.

MARSHALL,

Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the

court to the following effet:
This case comes up on two bills of exceptions.
1st. As to the notice of taking the deposition; and,
2a. As to its applicability.
1. As to the notice. There are two modes of taking
depositions under the act of Congress. By the first,
notice in certain cases is not necessary, but the forms
prescribed must be strictly pursued. This deposition
is not taken under that part of the act. By a subsequent part of the section, depositions may be taken by
dedimnus potestatetn, according to common usage. The
laws of Virginia, therefore, are to be referred to on
the subject of notice. Those laws do not authorise
notice to an attorney at law.
'he word attorney, in
the act of assembly, means attorney in fact.. An-attorney at law is not compellable to receive notice; but he
may consent to receive, or he may waive i't, and sh U1
not afterwards be permitted to object the want of it.
But this deposition was not taken agreeably to the no.
tice 'received. The commissioners did not adjourn
fioma day to day, but passed over the intermediate time
between the 12th and the 19th of August.
This circumstance, however, is not, by the court,
deemed fatal, under the particular circumstances of this
case, though withpui those circumstances it 'might,
perhaps, be so considered. The agreement, that the
deposition might- be taken, whether the attorney were
present or absent; his subsequent 'xamination of the
deposition, without -objecting to the wanE of notice,
and the death of the witness, were sufficient grounds
for the defendant to believe, that the objection would
be waived.
2. The objection to the competency of M'Lain, is
totally unfounded, as itdoes not appear, upon the reVoL III.

cord, that he was. the guardian; and especially, as
the defendant became of full age, lefore the trial.
3. The objection to the applicability of the deposition, is also void of foundation. For, although it was
not conclusive evidence, it was still admissible.
The court is, therefore, of opinion7 that there is no
error in the judgment below.
Judgment affirmed.
