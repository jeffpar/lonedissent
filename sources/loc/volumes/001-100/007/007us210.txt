Independent of the proof made by the plaintiff, that
the sums of money received by the Ramsays from
Wilson, were really on their own account, the instruction would not have been proper as this case ac.'
tually stood. There was a running account -between
the Ramsays and.Wilson, Who had large transactions
with each other, and who reciprocally advanced large
sums. This running account is not stated by the defendant, in the proposition for the opinion of the court.
The effect it produces, is to make it proper for Wilson
,to prove, that advances made by him to the Ramsays,
were not designed to satify their particular engagements
with each other; but were intended to discharge the
debt due to Codman. Terms art improperly used in
the bill, which imply a fact contradicted by the testimony. The word payment is used instead of the
word ad'vance, and this at first view, may produce an
obscurity, which is 'dissipated on investigating the
record.
The judgment is to be affirmed with costs.

Mason, for the plaintiffs in error. If the insurance
was upon an illegal transaction, the defendants in- error
have no right to recover. The only question for th6 consideration of this court is, whether it be a transaction
prohibited by the act of congress. If the purchase of
this cargo in Cape-Francoiswas lawful, the policy is good.
The first section of the 'act has -two branches, and contemplates two separate offences-ist. That no vbssel
shall be allowed to go to a French port. But tfils prohibition must be subject to the general principle, that the
actof God, or of the public enemy, shall be an excuse.
2d. That if driven into such port by distress, or involuntarily carried in) yet, there shall be no trade or
traffic.
T'he words are, "if any vessel shall be voluntarily carried, or suffered to proceed to any French port' o' place
as aforesaid, o? shall be employeil as aforesaid." The
going in must be voluntary, but the legislature carefully
omit the word voluntarily, when speaking pf the offence
of trading; for all trading must be voluntary ; it cannot

be by compulsion. The object was to prevent intercourse, HALLZT
and the statute only makes the samp saving of the for- AND Bowxrz
feiture, which a court Wvould have made without such a J V. A
saving clause.
oTusnL.
The condition of the bond mentioned in the 2d section,
confirms this construction of the 1st. It is divided into
two clauses, agreeably to the two offences to be provided
against. The proviso, "unless by distress of weather,"
&c. is annexed only to the offence of going into the port,
but there is no saving or exception as to the offence of
trading.
If she had not been driven in by distriss of weather,
she would have been liable to forfeiture under the first
offence.- -But having been employed in traffic with persons resident, &c. she is equally liable to forfeiture under
the second, and the condition of the bond has been substantially broken.
The special verdict states, "that the captain and supercargo were permitted lo sell, and did sell the residue of
the cargo io different persons there." Here was no compulsion. This selling Was a violation of the law; but it
is not that which avoids this policy. The fault was, that
with the proceeds of those sales, the plaintiffs below purchased the cargo insured. There was no compulsion to
do this, except what I shall presently notice,* as stated in
the verdict.. It will . rolably be contended that te following words of the verdict show a c6mpulsion, viz.
" tfat the said officers forbade the said master and supercargo from'taking on board the cargo landed from the
said vessel, or from conveyihg from the said island any
spede, by reason zhereof, they were compelled to sell
the same, and to take ihe produce of that country in payment." But this is only the reasoning of the jury', and
the words, by reason whereof, show what kind of compulsion it was, and that it was not that inevitable necessity which can excuse the eipress violation of the law.
The owners ought to have said to them, if you forbid us
to take away. our property, we must leave it, and look to
our government for an indemnification ; for they have
forbidden us to sell it to you, or to pirchase a liew cargo.
The forbiddimg. them to relade their goods, and to take

The act of the 27th February, 1800, vol. 5,p. 15, shows
what the construction of that of 1798 ought to be. The
3a section of the former provides, that in case the vessel
shall be compelled, by distress Qr superior force, to go into
a Frefich port, and shall there necessarily" unlade and d&,
liver, or shall be deprived of any cargo then on board, the
master may receive payment in bills of exchange, money
,or bullion, and not otherwise, -"add shall not the'reby be
uhdcrstood to contravenethis law."
This Is a clear implication; that lfthere had not been
such an express permission to receive payment in bills of
exchange, money or bullion, it would have been a contravention of the law ; and that law, excepting this provision, is substantially the same as the lw of 1798.
Harper, contra. I miqht safely agree to the first iosition taken by the opposite counsel, that the'lst section
of the act of 1798 createยง two distinct offences. -But this
is not sq. The whole constitutes but one offence.
How' is a ship to be employed in - traffic? ' She muast

traffic.
-

But if the act creates two separate offerices, how is thb
vessel employed in the traffic ? She did riot carry the
cargo there voluntarily. But it being there, and landed,
nccessarily landed, how is the vessel concerned in the
sales and purchases made by the master? The necessity
of repairing the vessel is as much an excuse for landing
the cargo, as stress of weather was for going in." The
master was forbidden to relade It. But' a difference if
taken betwcen prohibitionand prevention. It is said that
theforbidding is not preventing. But by whom was tho
prohibition ? by the officers of the government, having
authority and power to carry the prohibition into eact,
It was, therefore, actual prevention.

FEBRUARY, i864.

What was the mischief intended to be remedied by the HALET
act of congress ? Not such a sale as this. It was to pre- AMD Bowv.
vent a voluntary intercourse, not to prevent citizens of
rrauns
the United States from rescuing their property from impending loss. 'What is taffic ? A contract by consent of
both parties. If one is under compulsion, it is no -contract, no traffic. The transaction disclosed by.the verdict is only the means of saving property from a total
loss. The owifers were not obliged to abandon, as the
gentleman contends, property thus put in jeopardy. The
master and supercargo were not free agents. They wer*e
not obliged to take bills which they knew would not be
paid. If I could-have had a doubt upon this case, it would
have been. removed by the decisions of the circuit courts
of the United States. In a case before one of your honours, in Baltimore, a vessel had brought home from
the French West-Indies a cargo of the produce
of those islands, after having been compelled to go
in and sell her outward cargo ; and it was decided, that
the case was not within this act of congress. A similar
case is understood to have been decided by another of
your honouts,t in New-York. If those cases were not
'within the law, I arh warranted in saying this is not.
Those decisions produced the 3d section of the act of
1800, which the gentleman has cited, and which was introduced to shut the door that had been left open. It was
perceived, that the law, as it stood before, would give an
opportunity of fraud. The 3d siction.was enacted to take
away the temptation; because, although there might b
cases dear, of fraud, it-was thought best to sacrifice these
particular cases, that fraud might be prevented in others.
T11N section, therefore, has given a sanction to the decisions of the circuit courts.
Key, in reply. It is clear, that therd are two distinct
prohibitions in the act. The two parts of the section are
connected by the disjunctive "or," and not by the copulative,"-and." This is rendered still more evident by the
form of the-condition of the bond described in the 2d section.

Another fact shows that it was trading, not merely
talking on board, to bring home, property which they were
compelled to receive. She was not coming hokne with the
property when she was captured, but going on a trading
voyage. And the French pass states, that she came to
Cape Francois for trade and business.
The intention of the act was to prevent all trading and
intercourse with France or her dependencies.

mason, on the same side. It is said, 'there must
be a pre-existing intention to go to a French port. If the
sloop had arrived safe at the Havanna, andbeen there sold
to an agent of the French government, it is clear she would
have been liable to f6rfeiture. So, if the French agent,
who signed the passport, had freighted the vessel.
These caqes show, that a pre-existing intention is not,
necessary. The construction contended for would, indeed, open a wide door to fraud, as the gentleman has
contended. It would only be necessary to start a plank
in sight of the port, and then go in to stop the leak, and
the whole law is evaded. 1

called the non-intercourse law.
It is contended by the counsel for the defendant, that
the circumstances, stated in the special verdict, do not
show an absolute necessity for the trading therein described.
Aid it is said, the plaintiff might have abandoned th~e property, and sought redress of his government ; and that it was his duty to do so, rather than violate the laws of his country. But the court is of opinioti,
that the act of congress did not impose such terms upon
a person who was forced by stress of -weather to enter a
French port, and land his cargo, and was prevented by
the public officers'of that port to relade and carry it away.
.Even if an actual and general war had existed between this country and France, and the plaintiff had been
driven into a French port, a part of his cargo seized, and
he had been permitted by the officers of the port to sell
the residue, and purchase anew dargo, ] am of opinion,
that it wodld not have been deemed siich a traffic with
the enemy as would vitiate the policy upon such .ne'
cargo.
The terms of the act of congress seemto imply an intentional offence Pn the part of the owners.
The case put of a French agent going to the Havanna;
and there purchasing the cargo for tJi.e pse of the French
government, ander a pre-concert with the owners, would
certainly be an offence against the law; but when there is
no such intention; when the vessel fias been absolutely
foiced, by stress of weather, to go into a French port,

and land her cargo ; when part has been seized for the uqe
of the government of France, -and the master has beepi
forbidden by the public officers of the Isort to relade the
residue, and to sell it for any thing valuable, except the
produce of the country, the mere taking away such produce cannot be deemed such a traffic as iA contemplated
by the Act of congress.
