Whilst an ejectment suit was pending to try the legal title to a tract of land in Mississippi, the defendants filed a bill on the equity side of the court, praying for a*
perpetual injunction, upon the ground that the plaintiffs had obtained a patent
from the United States by fraud and misrepresentation.

But the fraud is not established by the evidence, and therefore the, bill must be dismissed, and the parties remitted to the trial at law.
Where there are reservations, in Indian treaties, of specific tracts of land, which ara

afterwards found to be the sections set apart for school purposes under a general

law, the reserkees have the better title. They holdunder the original Indian title

which the United States confirmed in the treaty.

But where the reservee claimed under a float, no specific tract of land being designated for him in the treaty, this court abstains from expressing an opinion, that being

the legal question pending in the court below.

THIS was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
Stites for the Southern District of Mississippi.
It was an appeal from a decree by the equity side of the
court, graiting a perpetual injunction upon the appellants, who
were plaintiffs in an ejectment suit then pending on the law
side of the court.
In the second ar ticle of the supplement of Dancing Rabbit
Creek treaty (7 Stat. at Large, 340), made on the 27th of September, 1830, there is this reservation :,-- "Also, one section is
allowed to the following persons, to wit, Middleton Mackey,
Wesley Train, Choclehomo, Moses Foster, D. W. Wall, &c.,
to be located in entire sections, to include thel: present residence and improvement, with the exception of Molly Nail and
Susan Colbert, who are authorized to locate theirs on any unimproved unoccupied land."
On the 27th of August, 1832,-D. W. Wall, one of the reservees, assigned all his right and title under the treaty to
George S. Gaines and Allen Glover, who procured a patent for
the sixteenth section to be issued to them, in pursuance of this
claim under the treaty, by the President, on the 7th of December, 1838.
In the year 1841, George S. Gaines, Francis S. Lyon, and
the heirs at law" of Allen Glover, instituted' an ejectment against
John Hilman, who was the tenant in possession under the
trustees of the school lands.

Gaines et al. v. Nicholson et al.

In 1842 these trustees filed a bill on the equity side of the
court, from which the following are extracts:"Humbly complaining, your orators would respectfully show
unto your Honors, that your orators, Isaac W. Nicholson, Powhatan B. Thermond, Lewis B. Barnes, John T. Moseley, and
S. M. Goode, are the trustees of the schools and school lands
reserved by the acts of Congress for the use of schools in township twelve, range 'eighteen east, situated in the County of
Kemper, in the State of Mississippi. They would further show
unto your Honors, that section sixteen, in said township twelve,
range eighteen east, was reserved, by the acts of Congress, for
the use of schools in said township, and, being so re~erved,
your orators took possession of the same, and leased it to your
orator, John Hilman, who went into possession of said tract of
land prior to the 27th day of March, 1841, and has continued
in possession ever since until this time.
"Your orators would further show unto your Honors, that
on the 27th day of March, in the year 1841, an action of ejectment was instituted, on the law side of this honorable court, by
John Doe, lessee of George S. Gaines and Francis S. Lyon, and
of the heirs at law of Allen Glover, deceased, against'your
orator, John Hilman, for the recovery of said section sixteen,
and to dispossess and eject your orators therefrom, wtiich suit
is still pending undetermined in said court.
"Your orators would further show unto your Honors, that
by virtue of the second article of the supplement of Dancing
Rabbit Creek Treaty, entered into on the 27th day of September, 1830, between the United States and the Choctaw trrbe
of Indians, certain portions of land, situated within the Territory
ceded by the said Indians to the United States, were reserved
to divers members of said tribe of Indians, and, amongst others,
a section of land w~s reserved to David W. Wall, in the following words, to wit: -' Also, one section is allowed to the following persons, to wit, Middleton Mackey, Wesley Train,
Choclehomo, Moses Foster, D. W. Wall, &c., to be located in.
entire sections, to include their present residence and improvement, with the exception of Molly Nail and Susan Colbert,
who are authorized to locate theirs on any unimproved unoccupied land.'
"Your orators would further show unto your Honors, that
on the 27th day of August, in the year 1832, the said David
W. W.Vall, by deed of that date, bargained, sold, and conveyed,
to George S. Gaines and Allen Glover, all the right, title, in-.
terest, and claim of him, the said David W. Wall, in and to a
certain reservation of one section or six hundred and fifty acres

of land, made and granted to him, the said David W. Wall,
under and by virtue of the provisions of a treaty made and
concluded between the United States of America and the Choctaw tribe of Indians, at a place called Dancing Rabbit Creek, in
said nation, in the month of September, 1830.
"Your orators would further show unto your Honors, that
the said George S. Gaines and Allen Glover, deceased, falsely
and fraudulently pretending and representing to the President
of the United States that the said David W. Wall, at the date
bf said treaty, resided upon said section sixteen, in the township and range aforesaid, and had his improvement thereupon,
and that they had located the reservation of said Wall upon the
same on the 7th day of December, in the year 1838, procured
a patent to be issued to them, conveying to them the said section sixtten, in township twelve, range eighteen east.
"Your orators would further show unto your Honors, that
at the date of said treaty the said David W. Wall did not reside,
nor had he any improvement, upon said section sixteen, as
aforesaid, but resided at a long distance fkom the same, and had
no right or title, claim or interest whatever, in said section of
land, which had been reserved, as your orators distinctly and
positively aver, for the use of schools in the State of Mississippi, by the laws of the United States.
"1Your orators would further show to your Honors, that
the said Gaines and Glover were so well aware that they had
no right to the said section of land, by virtue of their purchase
from the said Wall, that they located the claim of said Wall at
one time, as your orators have been informed and believe, upon
another section of land near Mayhew, in Oaktibbeha County,
but finding that their claim to said last-named section would
be disputed, they, in the technical language of land-mongers
and speculators, lifted the same, and laid it upon said section
sixteen. Your orators would further show unto your Honors,
that, by virtue of the patent thus falsely and fraudulently obtained, they have been advised that the said Gaines and Allen
Glover, deceased, obtained the highest and best legal title to
said section sixteen, when, in equity and justice, they have no
title thereto, but the same belongs to your orators, as trustees
and tenant of the schools and school lands, as aforesaid."
The bill then proceeded with the usual interrogatories,
prayed for a temporary injunction, and afterwards a perpetual
one.

A temporary injunction was granted.
The respondents, in their answer, set forth the circumstances
of the treaty, averred that the United States were incapable of

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

359

Gaines et al. v. Nicholson et al.

making any grant of land which was reserved by the treaty,
and denied the alleged fraud in the following manner: "These respondents, further answering, say that the said
George S. Gaines and Allen Glover, deceased, never did, jointly, nor did either of them severally or separately, falsely pretend and represent to the President of the United States that
the said David W. Wall, at the date of the treaty, resided upon
section sixteen, in the township and range -aforesaid, and had
his improvement thereupon; no such pretence was ever set up
or representation made to the President of the United States, or
any one else, by the said George S. Gaines, or Allen Glover, in
his lifetime, or either of them. A reference to the record of
the executive department of the government, or even to the
published documents relating to the public lands, would have
relieved the complainants from an .allegation so utterly false
and unfounded."
To this answer there was a general replication.
Some testimony was taken bearing upon the points of Wall's
residence, age, &c., but none touching the fraudulent representations alleged to have been made in the procurement of the
patent.
On the 18th of November, 1845, the Circuit Court passed
the following decree.
"Be it remembered, that this cause came on to be heard at
the present term, before the Honorable Samuel . Gholson,
judge, &c., presiding, upon the bill, answers, exhibits, agreements, and proof in the cause, and upon argument on both
sides; and now, at this day, the court being sufficiently advised, and because it appears to the satisfaction of the court
that the complainants are entitled to the relief prayed for by
them, it is therefore 'ordered, adjudged, atid decreed, and the
court doth hereby order, adjudge, and decree, that the judgment at law in the pleadings mentioned, and all attempts to
enforce the same, be, and the same is hereby, perpetually enjoined; and, also, that the said defendants be, and they are
hereby, perpetually enjoined from ejecting and turning out, or
from commencing any other or further suit to eject and turn
the said complainants, or their successors in office, out: of the
possession of the section of land in the pleadings mentioned, to
wit, section sixteen, in township twelve, range eighteen east,
in Kemper County. It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed, and the court doth hereby order, adjudge, and decree,
that the defendants shall, within sixty days from the date of
this decree, by deed, in fee simple, without warranty, convey,
quitclaim, and relinquish to the complainants and their suc-

cessors in office, as trustees of schools and school lands, all the
right, title, claim, and interest which they, the said defendants,
or any of them, have in and to said section of land; and in default of such conveyance being made by said defendants in the
time aforesaid, then the clerk of this court be, and he is hereby,
appointed a commissioner to carry into effect that portion of
this decree directing said conveyance. It is further ordered,
adjudged, and, decreed, that the defendants shall pay all the
costs of this suit. This ordered, adjudged, and decreed, this
18th of November, 1845."
From which decree the defendants pray an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which is granted.
The cause was argued by Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Badger,
with whom was Mr. Inge, for the appellants, no counsel appearing for the appellees.
The counsel for the appellants made the following points:1. That by the treaty the whole cession passed to. the
United States, subject to the reservations mentioned in the
treaty, which were in the nature of exceptions out of the grant,
and, when actually located according to the treaty, took effect
by relation from its'date, so as not to be liable to atly disposition by the United States; and consequently, if the sixteenth
section was rightfully selected as the location of Wall's reservation, the same could not, by any law of the United States, be
set apart or appropriated to any other purpose ; and if such appropriation in fact was made or attempted, which is not admitted, it was void as against Wall's claim.
2. That, acbording td the true interpretation of the treaty,
each of the persons named in the above-quoted clause of thesupplement was entitled to a section, whether he had a residence or not. The fact of a residence was immaterial to the
right, - which was absolute, independently of residence, - and
only served to determine the location where the' party had
a residence; those without residences, and the two persons
specially excepted out of the restriction imposed by the residence, having necessarily a right to make locations on any unimproved and unoccupied land. Otherwise, the main purpose
of the clause would be disappointed, contrary to its true intent
upon sound rules of constructibn. But if this were doubtful
upon the clause- itself, our interpretation must still prevail; because by the eighteenth article of the treaty (7 Stat. at Large,
336) it is expressly-declared and .agreed, that even well-founded
doubts shall be resolved in its interpretation in favor of the In-

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

361

Gaines et al. v. Nicholson et aL

dians. And therefore, it not appearing that Wall had any residence of his own, but it being, on the contrary, proved that at
the date of the treaty he was an unmarried man, without any
family, and residing in the family of another person, the location of his reservation upon the sixteenth section was well and
rightfully ihade, and the patent"properly issued.
3. If Wall's reservation was not rightfully located upon the
said sixteenth section, yet the appellees were not entitled to
relief. Their case is, in substance, that Gaines and Glover, by
representing to the President of the United States that Wall
had a residence in that section, fraudulently procured the grant
to issue, &c. But all such representations are denied by the
appellants, and no proof is offered to sustain the charge. The
appellants aver, and the fact is, that the location was made and
the grant issued upon a representation of the truth as ihey understood it, and with full knowledge of the facts by the officers
of the government. So that, if Wall was not entitled so to locate, the case was one of mere error on the part of the governnent in the interpretation of the treaty, and not a fraudulent
contrivance of the party to prejudge or mislead those officers.
And therefore the case, as it appears, would give no ground of
relief if truly stated in the bill ; and if it would, yet that case
does not sustain the bill as framed.
And upon the whole, it will be insisted that the decree is
erroneous, and ought to be reversed and the bill dismissed.
The following authorities will be relied on.
On the first point, Doe v. Beardsley, 2 McLean, 412; Stockton v. Williams, 1 Douglass, (Mich.) 547; Act of April 21,
1806 (2 Stat. at Large, 401, sec. 6); act of March 3, 1803

This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of the

The bill was filed by the appellees in the court below against

township twelve, range eighteen east, County of Kemper,
State of Mississippi.
By the twelfth section of an act of Congress, passed March
3, 1803,- entitled " An act regulating the grants of land, and
providing for the disposal of the lands of the United States
south of the State of Tennessee" (2 Stat. at Large, 229), the
sixteenth section in each township was reserved, and appropriated to the support of schools within the same. And by the
sixth section of an act of Congress, passed April 21, 1806,
entitled an act in addition to the act aforesaid (2 Stat. at
Large, 401), it was provided, that whenever the sixteenth
section should fall upon land already granted by Congress, or
claimed by virtue of a British grant, the Secretary of the
Treasury should locate another section in lieu thereof for the
use of schools within the township. And by an act of Congress, passed January 9, 1815, entitled "An act to provide for
leasing certain lands reserved for the support of schools in the
Mississippi Territory" (3 Stat. at Large, 163), it was provided,
that the county court of each county in the Territory should
appoint agents, who were empowered to lease these reserved
sections for the purpose of improving the same, or for an annual rent, as they might think best; and to apply the proceeds
to purposes of education within the township.
The act also provided for laying out the sections into convenient farms, of not less than one hundred and sixty, nor more
than three hundred and twenty acres each; for the removal 'of
intruders and trespassers; and also for the punishment of all
p rsons cutting timber or committing other waste upon the
tract.
The last section provided, that the leases granted by virtue
of the act should be limited to the period of the termination of
the Territorial overnment, and should cease after the 1st of
January next succeeding the establishment of the State government.
It is admitted that the appellees are the trustees of schools
and school lands in 'township No. 12, duly elected and qualified
under the laws of the State of Mississippi; and that they are
charged with the care and management of the same (How. &
Hutch. Dig., p. 125, et seg.); and also, that John Hilman, the
defendant in the ejectment suit, was in possession under a lease
from the said trustees.
They had taken possession of the section as early as 1834.
The suit in ejectment was brought'in 1841.
The premises lie within the territory formerly belonging to
the Choctaw nation of Indians, and which was ceded to the

JANUARY

TERM, 1850.

Gaines et a]. v. Nicholson et al.

United States, by treaty, at Dancing Rabbit Creek, 27th September, 1830 (7' Stat. at Large, 333).
By the supplementary articles of that treaty (p. 340), certain reservations were made to Indians by name, and among
others the following: - "Also, one section is allowed to the
following persons, to wit, Middleton Mackey, Wesley Train,
Choclehomo, Moses Foster, D. W. Wall, &c., to be located in
entire sections, to include their present residence and improvement, with the exception of Molly Nail and Susan Colbert,
who are authorized to locate theirs on any unimproved unoccupied land."
D. W. Wall, one of the reservees, on the 27th of August,
1832, assigned all his right and title under the treaty to
George S. Gaines and Allen Glover, who procured a patent
for the sixteenth section to be issued to them, in pursuance of
this claim under the treaty, by the President, on the 7th of
December, 1838.
The former, and the heirs of the latter, compose the plaintiffs
in the ejectment suit in the court below, claiming under the
patent; and the defendants in the bill filed to enjoin that suit
by the school trustees, claiming under -the acts of Congress
above referred to.
The court below granted a preliminary injunction on the
filing of the bill, staying the proceedings at law, and on the
final hearing decreed a perpetual injunction ; and also, that the
defendants relinqqish all their right and interest in the section
to the school trqstees and their su~ccessors in office.
The clause in the treaty reserving to Wall, among others, a
section of the land ceded, upon a strict construction of its terms,
would seem to confine th6 reservation to a tract, not exceeding
a section, on which he resided and had made improvements at
the date of the treaty; but a more liberal construction has
been properly given to the clause by the officers of the government, and which was inculcated by the eighteenth article of
the treaty itself, by which the reservee is- allowed a section,
although not a resident at the time, and without having made
any improvements upon the particular tract. In cases of residence and improvements, the location must be such as shall include them.
Wall, it seems, was a minor, and resided with his father at
the date of the treaty, and therefore was not within its terms,
so that locality could be given to any particular section by a
reference to residence or improvements. But under the liberal
construction mentioned, the right to a section, notwithstanding, existed, - a right, however, to no particular tract or see-

SUPREME COURT.
Gaines et al. v. Nicholson et al.

tion, but at large, to be located upon some portion of the ceded
territory, - what, in common parlance, is denominated a float.
The deed to Gaines and Glover does not profess to convey
any particular section, but only his right, generally, to that
amount of land reserved to him under the treaty. A location,
therefore, became necessary before the issuing of the patent by
the President.
The bill charges that the grantees, Gaines and Glover, in
order to induce the President to issue the patent to them for
the sixteenth section of township No. 12, which, it is claimed,
had been appropriated by the acts of Congress already referred
to, for the use of schools, falsely and fraudulently represented
that Wall resided upon the same at the date of the treaty, and
had made improvements thereon; thus bringing the application
for the particular parcel of land within the strict terms of the
treaty, and presenting a case upon which the right to it was,
confessedly, paramount to any that could be pretended in the
State or township, as a school reservation.
This is the ground set forth by the complainants upon which
to invoke the equitable interposition of the court to set aside
and annul the patent, and remove the encumbrance from their
title, and to stay the proceedings at law. And undoubtedly,
if the facts thus charged have been established by the pleadings
and proofs, a right to such equitable interposition for the relief
sought has been made out, and the decree of the court below
should be upheld.
But, on looking into the answer and proofs in the record,
there does not appear to be any evidence of the fraud or imposition alleged-; nor any thing to rebut the presumption, which
we must assume till the contrary is shown, that the patent was
issued with a full knowledge of all the circumstances upon
which the complainants rely to invalidate it. Fraud is not to
be presumed, and the burden, therefore, lay upon the complainants to establish it; and having failed, all ground for the equitable relief failed also; and the court below should have dismissed the bill, leaving the parties to the settlement of their
rights in the action at law. In the absence of ;ranA or imposition in the issuing -of the patent, the question was one of
conflicting title under the treaty on one side, and the acts of
Congress, appropriating every sixteenth section in the townships for the benefit of schools, on the other, -a question purely of law.
The State of Mississippi acquired a right to every sixteenth
section, by virtue of these acts, on the extinguishment of the
India right of occupancy, the title to which, in respect to the

JANUARY

TERM, 1850.

365

Gaines et al. v. Nicholson et al.

particular sections, became vested, if vested at al, as sotn as
the surveys were made and the sections designated. No patent
was necessary, or is ever issued, for these school sections. And
the question presented is, whether the general right reserved to
Wall under the treaty, to select a section of land in the ceded
territory, opdrated to suspend the vesting of the title in th§
State, till a selection could be made and patent issued, under
the direction of the President; or whether the selection in
respect to these general floating rights, that bound no particular
parcel or section, must be made in subordination to the right
acquired by the State.
The question, as before said, is one of law, and should have
been left to the trial at law in the action of ejectment pending
between the parties.
There is no doubt but that all persons'in whose behalf reservations were made under the treaty, and who were residents
upon any particular tract, and had made improvements thereon
at its date, were entitled to the section, including their improvements, in preference to any other right that could have been
previously acquired under the government; because the land
embraced within the section was so much excepted from the
cession. No previous grant of Congress could be paramount,
according to the rights of occupancy which this government
has always conceded to the Indian tribes within her jurisdiction.
It was so much carved out of the Territory ceded, and remained to, the Indian occupant, as lie had never parted with it.
He holds, strictly speaking,-not under the treaty of cession, but
under his original title, confirmed by the government in the act
of agreeing to the reservation.
But the question here is, whether the reservation of a right,
not to any particular parcel or section of the territory ceded,
but a right, generally, to have that quantity of land out of it,
and to be located under the direction of the President, stands
upon the same footing, and has the effect to cut off the right
claimed by the State to have attached under the acts of Congress to the school section previous to the location made by the
President.
We forbear expressing any opinion upon it, as the question
is not now properly before us, and as it belongs to the action
at law, the trial of which should not be anticipated or the case
prejudged.
We shall therefore reverse the decree, and remit the proceedings to the court below, with directions to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the bill of the complainants.

SUPREME COURT.
Barrow v. Reab.

Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of Mississippi, and was argued by counsel.
On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and decreed
by this court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this
cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs, and that
this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said
Circuit Court, for further proceedings to be had therein, in conformity to the opinion of this court.

ROBERT RUFFIN BARROW, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR,

. JOSIAH REAB.

Ko exception can be taken in this court which was not moved below, or which does
not appear in some way oR the record below.
Formerly, the laws of Louisiana did not allow interest on accounts or unliquidated
claims; but now it is due from the time the debtor is put in default for the payment of the principal.

THIS case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana.
Reab was a citizen of Connecticut, and Barrow of Louisiana.
The facts in the case appeared by the record to be these.
On the 5th of -February, 1845, Reab purchased, at New
Orleans, from J. R. Conner, alleged to be the lawfully authorized agent of Barrow, 35,000 gallons of molasses, at the rate
of twelve and a half cents per gallon, to be delivered at
Field's Mills on the Bayou Lafourche; said molasses being represented as the crops of two plantations owned by Barrow,
one being called the Myrtle Grove Plantation, and the other
being called the Home Plantation, or Home Place. At the
time of purchase, Reab paid to Conner for Barrow five hundred dollars.
Conner gave an order upon Barrow for the molasses, to
be delivered to Reab or order, who sent a William Patton for
it. The overseer wrote upon the face of the order, in pencil,
,"The molasses has all been shipped from Myrtle Grove and the
Residence."
On the 20th of March, 1845, Reab brought an action in the
Circuit Court against Barrow, claiming, for expenses of sending a vessel, &e., and for the rise in the price of molasses, the
sum of $ 3,755.07.
On the 22" of April, 1845, Barrow answered the petition by
