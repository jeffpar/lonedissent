we can learn, and during the last fifteen years we have the
authority of Mr. Justice Clifford for saying that the law has
always been held in that circuit to be otherwise.
For this error the judgment must be reversed and a venire de

ARTHU-R v. ZIMMERxAN.
1. The distinction between "cotton braids" and "other manufactures of cotton
not otherwise provided for," and "hat braids," has been established and
recognized by Congress by the acts of March 2, 1861 (12 Stat. 178), and
July 14, 1862 (id. 543), and sect. 2504 of the Revised Statutes.
2. "Braids . . . used for making or ornamenting hats," being specifically enumerated in said acts of 1861 and 1862, are subject to the duty thereby prescribed,
and not to that imposed by the sixth section of the act of June 30, 1864 (13
Stat. 209), upon "cotton braids, insertings, lace trimmings, or bobbinets, and
all other manufactures of cotton not otherwise provided for."

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of New York.
In 1873 and 1874, Zimmerman imported certain goods from
France, which were composed of cotton, and commercially
known as "hat braids." Arthur, the collector of the port of New
York, imposed upon them, and collected, under protest, a duty
of ninety per cent of thirty-five per cent ad valorem, under the
sixth section of the tariff act of 1864 (13 Stat. 209), which
imposes that duty upon " cotton braids, insertings, lace trimmings, or bobbinets, and all other manufactures of cotton not
otherwise provided for."
It appeared, upon the trial of the suit to recover the excess
so paid, that there were goods known as cotton braids, used
for other purposes, but that the goods in question were commercially known as "hat braids," and used exclusively for making
and trimming hats and bonnets.
The court below, being of the opinion that the articles were
only liable to duty at thirty per cent, under the eighth section
of the act of July 14, 1862 (12 Stat. 551), so instructed the
jury, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff. Judgment having
been rendered thereon, the collector brought the case here.

ARTHUR V. STEPHANI.

Mr. Assistant-Attorney-GeneraZ Smith for the plaintiff in
error.
Mr.f . Davis, Jr., contra.
HUNT delivered the opinion of the court.
The articles imported by the defendant in error are embraced
in the general words of the act of 1864, and, if there -were
nothing else in the case, would be subject to the duty therein
provided.
They are, however, commercially known as "hat braids,"
used exclusively for enamelling hats and bonnets. These articles are specifically enumerated in the acts of 1861 and 1862,
and are there made subject to a different and a lower duty.
By these acts, and by the Revised Statutes, Congress establishes and recognizes the distinction between "cotton braids"
and "other manufactures of cotton not otherwise provided for,"
and "hat braids." 12 Stat. 178; id. 543, 551; Rev. Stat.,
sect. 2504.
Under the principles laid down in Arthur v. Morrison,Arthur
v. Lahey, and Arthur v. Unkart (supra, pp. 108, 112, 118), the
specific designation should prevail; and the judgment in favor
of the plaintiff for the excess of duties paid by him -was right,
and must be affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. lUST O

ALTHUR v. STEPHNia.
1. For tariff purposes, Congress has at all times, since the passage of the act
of May 2, 1792 (1 Stat. 259), intended to preserve the distinction between.
"chocolate" and "confectionery."
2. Chocolate, eo nomine, is, by the first section of the act of June 6, 1872 (17 Stat.
231), dutiable at the rate of five cents per pound; and, although put up in.
a particular form and sold as "confectionery," is not subjected to the duty
imposed on the latter article by the first section of the act of June 30, 1864

(13 id. 202).
