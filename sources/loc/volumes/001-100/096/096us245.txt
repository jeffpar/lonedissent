not, unless he was so authorized by his principals. The policy
declared that agents should not have authority to make such
waivers. And there is no evidence in this case that the company gave to the agent parol authority to waive a forfeiture
after it had occurred. They had ratified his acts extending the
time of payment of premium notes, when the extension was
made before the notes fell due. But no practice of the company
sanctioned any act of its agent done after a policy had expired,
by which new life was given to a dead contract.

1. Where a manufacturer has habitually stamped his goods with a particular
mark or brand, a court of equity will restrain another party from adopting
it for the same kind of goods.
2. Positive proof of fraudulent intent on the part of the infringer is not required
where the infringement is clearly shown.
8. Although no precise rule, applicable to all cases, can be laid down as to the
degree of resemblance necessary to constitute an infringement of a trademark, an injunction will be granted where the imitation is so close, that, by
the form, marks, contents, words, or their special arrangement, or by the
general appearance of the infringing device, purchasers exercising ordinary
caution are likely to be misled into buying the article bearing it for the
genuine one.
4. It is not necessary, to entitle a partyto an injunction, that a specific trade.
mark has been infringed. It is sufficient to satisfy the court that the
respondent intended to represent to the public that his goods were those of
the complainant.
5. In this case, the court holds that the appellant has infringed the trade-mark of
the appellee, but that the latter, by his long-continued acquiescence therein,
and his unreasonable delay in seeking relief, has been guilty of inexcusable laches, and is not entitled to an account for profits. The decree below
is therefore affirmed, so far as it awards an injunction, but reversed as to
damages; and costs in this court are allowed to the appellant.

from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Eastern District of Missouri.
The bill in this case was filed June 1, 1872, by Cochrane
Fleming, to restrain the alleged infringement of his trade-mark
for liver pills, by James H. McLean.
As early as 1834, Dr. Charles McLane, of Morgantown, Va.,
made and sold liver pills, putting them up in wooden boxes,

labelled "Dr. McLane's Liver Pills." In June, 1844. Jonathan Kidd, having purchased the exclusive right from him, began, at Pittsburg, Penn., to make and sell them. In 1845, Kidd
formed a partnership with John Fleming, under the name of
Jonathan Kidd & Co. Kidd died in 1853, and Fleming, the
surviving partner, and one Cochrane Fleming, having purchased from Kidd's executors all his interest in the business,
entered into partnership, under the name of Fleming Brothers.
That firm continued until 1865, when Cochrane retired. John
carried on the business in the firm name until his death, in
November, 1870, whereupon Cochrane succeeded under his will
to all his rights in the business.
Up to August, 1847, the pills in question were wrapped in
an ordinary printed label. In that year, Kidd & Co. commenced putting them up in wooden boxes, on the cover of each
of which were stamped in red wax the words "fMcLane's Liver
Pill," and on the wrapper, in a narrow border of scalloped
pattern surrounding a panel, with a background of wave-line
engraving, was printed in red ink a label bearing the words
"Dr. C. McLane's Celebrated Liver Pills." In 1855, Fleming
Bros. changed the color of the label to black, and made certain
other changes, as follows: the groundwork of the engraved
wrapper on the top of the box being composed of fine lines,
crossing the box diagonally, and at right angles with each
other, and bearing the words, in white, "Dr. C. McLane's Celebrated Liver Pills," "Celebrated Liver Pills" being upon a
scroll similar to a double ogee in form with a black background.
On the wrapper were also in white letters the words, "Prepared
only by Fleming Bros., successors to Jon. Kidd & Co.," and a
fac-simile of their signature and that of C. 'cLane, in black.
This label, which is referred to in the opinion of the court as
"Exhibit F," was used until October 1871, when another change
was made, and the label mentioned in the decree below, and in
the opinion of the court as " Exhibit H," was adopted. In it
the groundwork has shaded curved lines cutting and crcssing
each other in such a way as to produce the effect of alternate
light and shade, crossing the top of the box diagonally in place
of the straight lines in "Exhibit F." In this label, the words
"successors to Jon. Kidd & Co." are omitted.

McLEAN v. FLEMNG.

In 1849, James H. McLean commenced, at St. Louis, Mo.,
to manufacture his proprietary medicines, and, in 1851, to manufacture and sell liver pills, under the name of "Dr. McLean's
Universal Pills;" using first a type-printed label in red letters,
which he, in 1852, changed to a lithographed red label, called
in the decree "Exhibit L."
This label is printed in ink of a light red color, -with the
words, "Dr. McLean's Universal Pills," in white letters shaded
by red lines running parallel -with the length of the label. He
used this label until 1866, having in 1863 inserted therein the
initials (J. H.) of his name. In 1866, he changed his label
to that referred to in the decree as "Exhibit K." In this label,
the lines of the background, which is black, cross the top of
the box diagonally and at right angles to each other, with the
words "Dr. J. H. McLean's Universal Pills or Vegetable Liver
Pills" thereon, in white letters. The use of this label he continued until May, 1872, when he adopted a new one, in the use
.)f which no infringement of the complainant's label was found.
He also used a stamp in red wax on his goods.
The court below decreed that the respondent, his agents,
employds, and servants, be perpetually enjoined and restrained
from using, or causing to be used, the words, "D'r J. H. McLean's Universal Pills or Vegetable Liver Pills," or 1 D r
McLean's Universal Pills," or "D'r J. H. McLean's Universal
Pills," upon any label or wrapper for boxes or other packages
of pills, resembling or in imitation of the labels or wrappers
or trade-mark of the complainant, described as Exhibit H,
whether in style of engraving, printing, or lettering; and from
vending or exposing for sale, or causing to be vended or exposed for sale, any article of pills having upon the boxes or
other packages thereof any such labels or wrappers so made in
imitation of or resemblance to the said labels or wrappers of
the complainant; but did not enjoin or restrain him from using
them on any other labels or 'wrappers for pills than those described. It also referred the cause to a master, to take and
svate an account of the damages resulting to the complainant
since Nov. 9, 1870, from the violation of his rights.
The master reported the complainant's damages at $7,399.35.
The respondent excepted. His exception having been over-

delivered the opinion of the court.
Protection for lawful trade-marks may be obtained by individuals, firms, or corporations entitled to the same, if they
comply with the requirements prescribed by the act of Congress; and the provision is, that a trade-mark, duly registered
as required, shall remain in force thirty years from the date of
such registration, subject to an exception not necessary to be
noticed. 16 Stat. 210; Rev. Stat., sects. 4937, 4941.
Exclusive ownership of a certain medicinal manufacture,
known as "Dr. C. McLane's Liver-Pills," and of the trademark used in advertising and vending the same, is claimed by
the complainant; and the record shows that he, on the first
day of June, 1872, filed in the Circuit Court a bill of complaint
against the respondent, charging that the respondent had un
lawfully infringed the said trade-mark; and he prayed for a
decree that the respondent shall render an account of the gains
and profits made by the infringement, and for an injunction.
Service was made, and the respondent appeared and filed an
answer. Proofs were taken; and, the parties having been heard,
the court entered a decretal order in favor of the complainant,
and sent the cause to a master, to compute the amount of the
gains and profits. Due report was made by the master, to which
the respondent excepted; and the court overruled the exception,
confirmed the report of the master, and entered a final decree
for the complainant, in the sum of $7,399.35.
All matters in that court having been finally determined, the
respondent appealed to this court, and assigns errors as follows:
1. That the court erred in finding that the labels L and K, or
either of them, infringed Exhibit F, as set forth in the decretal
order. 2. That the court erred in finding that the complainant was entitled to any damages, and in ordering the assessment
thereof, and in allowing him costs. 3. That the court erred in
ordering an account of the sales of Exhibits L and K, pri:r to
the 16th of October, 1871, the date of the first tse of Exhibit II

iy the complainant. 4. That the court erred in overruling the
respondent's exception to the master's report.
Medicines of the kind described were first prepared and sold
by the physician whose name the pills bear, by putting the
same in wooden boxes, labelled with the name of the inventor.
For ten years, or more, he used the pills in his practice; but the
evidence shows that, on the 19th of June, 1844, he sold the
right to use the same to Jonathan Kidd, who, for a year or
more, prepared and sold the pills under that agreement, when
he formed a partnership with John Fleming, under the style of
"Jonathan Kidd & Co.;" which firm continued to prepare and
sell the pills until March 29, 1853, when the senior partner
died.
They (the firm) dealt largely in the business; and, as early as
1847, in order to designate the medicine as an article of their
own manufacture, and to prevent imposition and fraud, they
commenced putting the pills in wooden boxes, of uniform size,
shape, and appearance, each box containing twenty-two pills,
with the name of the original inventor stamped in red wax
upon the cover of each box, around which they placed the red
label or wrapper described in the bill of coriplaint. Beyond
doubt, that label, with its devices, and the red seal on the box,
constituted the trade-mark by which the firm made known to
their customers and the public the genuine pills which they
prepared and sold; the firm being at the time the owners of
the original recipe, and having the exclusive right to make and
vend the pills.
Within a month subsequent to the death of the senior partner
of the firm, his executors sold and conveyed all the interest of
the decedent in the business to the surviving partner and the
complainant, whereby they, under the firm name of "Fleming
Brothers," acquired not only the title to the recipe and the right
to make and vend the pills, but also the right to use the labels
and trade-marks used by the former owners. Possessed of the
whole interest, they (the firm, Fleming Brothers) prosecuted the
business, with some changes in the individual partners, until
July 1, 1865, when the present complainant sold out his whole
interest to his brother, John Fleming, who, as sole proprietor
of what the firm owned, continued the business until the 2d

McLEAN V. FLEMING.

[Sup. Ct.

of November, 1870, when he died, leaving a last will and
testament.
When that firm acquired the entire interest, they immediately enlarged the business, and in the year 1855 they adopted
the dark label, Exhibit F, which is fully and minutely described
in the bill of complaint; and the complainant avers that it has
since been used in the business, with no other substantial alterations than what are shown in Exhibit H, mentioned in the
decretal order.
Both parties agree that the complainant, by the will of his
deceased brother, acquired all the rights which the deceased
had in the business; and the record shows that he has, since
the probate of the will on the 9th of November, 1870, been
preparing and vending said pills, and using the labels and trademarks to designate their genuineness and to commend their
value and utility.
Evidence was introduced by the respondent, whose name is
James H. McLean, that he commenced in 1849, in St. Louis, to
manufacture his own medicines; that in 1851 he began to
manufacture and sell liver-pills, under the name of "Dr. McLean's Universal Pills," using first a type-printed label in red
letters, which was changed, in 1852, to a lithographed red
label, called in the decretal order "Exhibit L," which was used
down to 1866, except that about 1863 he added to his name the
initials "J. H.," so that the label read, "Dr. J. H. McLean's
Universal Pills;" that in 1866 he changed his label to the one
referred to in the decretal order as "Exhibit K," which he continued to use until May 21, 1872, when he adopted a new
label, the use of which does not infringe the trade-mark of the
complainant.
Governed by these facts as stated, the court will examine the
first error assigned; which is, that the court erred in finding
that the labels L and K infringed complainant's Exhibit H, as
set forth in the decretal order. By the order, the respondent,
James H. McLean, his agents, employ6s, and servants, are
petpetually enjoined and restrained from using, or causing to be
used, the words "Dr. J. H. McLean's Universal Pills or Vegetable Liver Pills," or the words "Dr. McLean's Universal
Pills," upon any label or wrapper for boxes or other pack-

ages of pills resembling or in imitation of the labels, wrappers,
or trade-mark of the complainant, described in his bill of complaint as "Exhibit H," whether in style of engraving, printing, or lettering; and from vending or exposing for sale, or
causing to be vended or exposed for sale, any article of pills
having upon the boxes or other packages thereof any such
labels or wrappers so made in imitation of or resemblance to
the said labels or wrappers of the complainant.
Equity gives relief in such a case, upon the ground that one
man is not allowed to offer his goods for sale, representing them
to be the manufacture of another trader in the same commodity.
Suppose the latter has obtained celebrity in his manufacture, he
is entitled to all the advantages of that celebrity, whether resulting from the greater demand for his goods or from the higher
price the public are willing to give for the article, rather than
for the goods of the other manufacturer, whose reputation is not
so high as a manufacturer. Where, therefore, a party has been
in the habit of stamping his goods with a particular mark or
brand, so that the purchasers of his goods having that mark or
brand know them to be of his manufacture, no other manufacturer has a right to adopt the same stamp; because, by doing
so, he would be substantially representing the goods to be the
manufacture of the person who first adopted the stamp, and so
would or might be depriving him of the profit he might make
by the sale of the goods which the purchaser intended to buy.
Seixo v. Provezende, Law Rep. 1 Ch.195.
What degree of resemblance is necessary to constitute an infringement is incapable of exact definition, as applicable to all
cases. All that courts of justice can do, in that regard, is to say
that no trader can adopt a trade-mark, so resembling that of
another trader, as that ordinary purchasers, buying with ordinary caution, are likely to be misled.
Unreasonable delay in bringing a suit is always a serious
objection to relief in equity; but cases arise in litigations of the
kind before the court where the complainant may be entitled
to an injunction to restrain the future use of a trade-mark, even
when it becomes the duty of the court to deny the prayer of
the bill of complaint for an account of past gains and profits.
Jfarison v. Taylor, 11 Jur. .. s. 408.

MCLEAN

v.

FLEMING.

[Sup. Ot.

In such cases, the question is not whether the complainant
was the original inventor or proprietor of the article made by
him, and on which he puts his trade-mark, nor whether the
article made and sold under his trade-mark by the respondent
is equal to his own 'in value or quality, but the court proceeds
on the ground that the complainant has a valuable interest in
the good-will of his trade or business, and, having adopted a
particular label, sign, or trade-mark, indicating to his customers
that the article bearing it is made or sold by him or by his
authority, or that he carries on business at a particular place,
he is entitled to protection against one who attempts to deprive
him of his trade or customers by using such labels, signs, or
trade-mark without his knowledge or consent. Coats v. Holbrook, 2 Sandf. (N. Y.) Ch. 586; Partridgev. Menck, 2 Barb.
(N. Y.) Ch. 101.
Everywhere courts of justice proceed upon the ground that a
party has a valuable interest in the good-will of his trade, and
in the labels or trade-mark which he adopts to enlarge and perpetuate it. Hence it is held that he, as proprietor, is entitled
to protection as against one who attempts to deprive him of the
benefits resulting from the same, by using his labels and trademark without his consent and authority. Decided cases to that
effect are quite numerous, and it is doubtless correct to say that
a person may have a right in his own name as a trade-mark as
against a trader or dealer of a different name; but the better
opinion is, that such a party is not, in general, entitled to the
exclusive use of a name, merely as such, without more. Millington v. Fox, ' Myl. & Cr. 338 ; Dent v. Turpin, 2 Johns. &
Hem. 139; Mleneely et al. v. 1eneel!y, 62 N. Y. 427.
Instead of that, he cannot have such a right, even in his own
name, as against another person of the same name, unless such
other person uses a form of stamp or label so like that used by
the complaining party as to represent that the goods of the
former are of the latter's manufacture. Nor will any other
name, merely as such, confer any such exclusive right, unless
the name is printed in some particular manner in a label of
some peculiar characteristics, so that it becomes, to some extent, identified with a particular kind of goods, or when the
name is used by the party, in connection with his place of busi-

ness, in such a manner that it assumes the character of a trademark within the legal meaning of that term, and as such entitles
the party to the protection of a court of equity, to prevent others
from infringing the proprietor's exclusive right. Gilman v.
iunnewell, 122 Mass. 189; Colladay v. Baird, 4 Phil. (Pa.)
139; Syles v. Sykes, 3 B. & C. 541; Croft v. -Day,7 Beav.
89; Burgess v. Burgess, 3 DeG., M. & G. 896; Holloway v.
Holloway, 13 Beav. 209 ; Rogers and Others v. Taintor, 97 Mass.
291.
Much must depend, in every case, upon the appearance and
special characteristics of the entire device; but it is safe to
declare, as a general rule, that exact similitude is not required
to constitute an infringement or to entitle the complaining
party to protection. If the form, marks, contents, words, or
the special arrangement of the same, or the general appearance
of the alleged infringer's device, is such as would be likely to
mislead one in the ordinary course of purchasing the goods, and
induce him to suppose that he was purchasing the genuine article, then the similitude is such as entitles the injured party to
equitable protection, if he takes seasonable measures to assert
his rights, and to" prevent their continued invasion. James v.
James, Law Rep. 13 Eq. 425; Singleton v. Bolton, 3 Doug.
293; Morrison v. Salmon, 2 Man. & G. 385; Boardman v.
lleriden Britannia Co., 35 Conn. 413.
Such a proprietor, if he owns or controls the goods which he
exposes to sale, is entitled to the exclusive use of any trademark adopted and applied by him to the goods, to distinguish
them as being of a particular manufacture and quality, even
though he is not the manufacturer, and the name of the realmanufacturer is used as part of the device. Walton v. Crowley,
3 Blatchf. 440; Emerson v. Badger, 101 Mass. 82.
Equity courts will not, in general, refuse an injunction on
account of delay in seeking relief, where the proof of infringement is clear, even though the delay may be such as to preclude
the party from any right to an account for past profits. Rodgers v. Rodgers, 31 L. T. 285; Blackwell v. Crabb, 45 L. J.
Pt. 1. 505.
Positive proof of fraudulent intent is not required where the
proof of infringement is clear, as the liability of the infringer

254

McLEAN

il. FLEMING.

[Sup Ct.

arises from the fact that he is enabled, through the unwarranted
use of the trade-mark, to sell a simulated article as and for the
one which is genuine. Wotherspoon v. Currie,Law Rep. 5 App.
Cas. 512.
Nor is it necessary, in order to give a right to an injunction,
that a specific trade-mark should be infringed; but it is sufficient that the court is satisfied that there was an intent on the
part of the respondent to palm off his goods as the goods of the
complainant, and that he persists in so doing after being requested to desist. IVoollam v. Batcliff, 1 Hem. & M. 259.
Apply these rules to the case, and it is clear that the charge
of infringement is satisfactorily proved in this case.
Words or devices, or even a name in certain cases, may be
adopted as trade-marks which are not the original invention of
the party who appropriates the same to that use; and courts of
equity will protect the proprietor against any fraudulent use
or imitation of the device by other dealers or manufacturers.
Property in the use of a trade-mark, however, bears very little
analogy to that which exists in copyrights or in patents for new
inventions or discoveries, as they are not required to be new,
and may not involve the least invention or skill in their discovery or application. Phrases, or even words in common use, may
be adopted for the purpose, if, at the time of their adoption,
they were not employed by another to designate the same or
similar articles of production or sale. Stamps or trade-marks
of the kind are employed to point out the origin, ownership, or
place of manufacture or sale of the article to which it is affixed,
or to give notice to the public who is the producer, or where it
may be purchased. Canal Company v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311.
Subject to the qualification before explained, a trade-mark
may consist of a name, symbol, figure, letter, form, or device,
if adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant in order to
designate the goods he manufactures or sells to distinguish the
same from those manufactured or sold by another, to the end
that the goods may be known in the market as his, and to
enable him to secure such profits as result from his reputation
for skill, industry, and fidelity. Upton, Trade-marks, 9; Taylor v. Carpenter,2 Sandf. (N. Y.) Ch. 603; Coddington, Dig. 9.
Complainant's pills have been in the market as a vendible

Oct. 1877.]

OMcLEAN v. FLEMING.

article for more than forty years, and during that whole period
have been sold under trade-marks of the forms heretofore suffi
ciently described, and they are still sold under the trade-mark
mentioned in the decretal order.
Difficulty frequently arises in determining the question of
infringement; but it is clear that exact similarity is not required, as that requirement would always enable the wrong-doer
to evade responsibility for his wrongful acts. Colorable imitation, which requires careful inspection to distinguish the spurious
trade-mark from the genuine, is sufficient-to maintain the issue;
but a court of equity will not interfere, when ordinary attention
by the purchaser of the article would enable him at once to
discriminate the one from the other. Where the similarity is
sufficient to convey a false impression to the public mind, and
is of a character to mislead and deceive the ordinary purchaser
in the exercise of ordinary care and caution in such matters, it
is sufficient to give the injured party a right to redress, if he
has been guilty of no laches. Amoskeag Manufacturing (o. v.
Spear, 2 Sandf. S. C. 599; Coddington, Dig. 109; McAndrew
v. Bassett, 4 DeG., J. & S. 380.
Argument to show that the name of the pills, as given in the
trade-mark of the respondent, was of a character to mislead and
deceive, is scarcely necessary, as they are idem sonans in the
usual pronunciation; nor can it be doubted that the form of
the box containing the pills and the general appearance of the
wrapper which surrounded it were calculated to have the same
effect. Mention may also be made of the fact that the color of
the label and the wax impression on the iop of the box are well
suited to divert the attention of the unsuspecting buyer from
-any critical examination of the prepared article.
Chancery protects trade-marks upon the ground that a party
shall not be permitted to sell his own goods as the goods of another; and, therefore, he will not be allowed to use the names,
marks, letters, or other indicice of another, by which he may
pass off his own goods to purchasers as the manufacture of another. Croft v. -Day,7 Beav. 84; Perry v. Truefitt, 6 id. 66;
Newman v. Alford, 51 N. Y. 192.
Witnesses in great numbers were called by the complainant,
who testified that the Exhibits L and K of the respondent were

McLEAN v. FLEMING.

[Sup. Ct.

calculated to deceive purchasers; and the reasons given by them
in support of the conclusion are both persuasive and convincing.
Difference between those exhibits and Exhibits F and H of the
complainant undoubtedly exist; and still it is manifest that the
general appearance of the package in the respects mentioned,
and others which might be suggested, is well calculated to
mislead and deceive the unwary and all others who purchase
the article without opening the box and examining the label.
Caswell et al. v. -Davis,58 N. Y. 223.
Two trade-marks are substantially the same in legal contemplation, if the resemblance is such as to deceive an ordinary
purchaser giving such attention to the same as such a purchaser
usually gives, and to cause him to purchase the one supposing
it to be the other. Gorham Company v. White, 14 Wall. 511.
Suffice it to say, without entering further into details, the
court is of the opinion that the first assignment of error must
be overruled, and that the injunction was properly granted to
prevent infringement subsequent to the filing of the bill of
complaint.
Suppose that is so, still the respondent contends that the
court erred, as alleged in the second assignment of errors, and
that the complainant is not entitled to an account, nor to a decree for gains, profits, or damages. Support to that proposition
is attempted to be drawn from the long delay of the complainant, and those under whom he claims, to take any legal steps to
protect their alleged rights. Opposed to that, it is insisted by
the complainant that no such defence is open to the respondent,
as it was not set up in the answer. Nothing of the kind is
directly set up in the answer; but the respondent denies all
intent to injure or defraud the complainant, and avers that he
has been engaged during the last twenty years in perfecting
his pills, and that he had no idea that his trade-marks infringed
the trade-marks of the complainant.
Proofs were taken upon both sides upon the subject; and the
respcndent, in his petition for rehearing filed in the court be.
low, expressly alleges that the immediate predecessor of the
complainant was perfectly familiar with the pills manufactured
by the respondent, and well knew that the respondent used the
labels in question; that the agent of the complainant, May 20,

Oct. 1877.]

.MCLEAN v. FLEMING.

1872, called on the respondent and remonstrated with him for
using the label Exhibit K, and that he on the following day
adopted a different label, as therein fully explained.
Examined in the light of these suggestions, the court is of
the opinion that the question presented in the second assignment of error is open for re-examination. Sullivan v. Portland,
&e. Railroad Co., 94 U. S. 806.
Repetition of the facts is unnecessary, as it sufficiently appears
that the respondent has been engaged in preparing and selling
his pills for more than forty years; that during that period, or
more than half of it, he has been using labels and trade-marks
corresponding more or less to those used by the predecessors of
the complainant, some of whom, during all or most of that
time, knew what the labels and trade-marks were which were
used by the respondent, the evidence to that effect being full
and decisive.
Negotiations took place at one time between the respondent
and one of the predecessors of the complainant for an interchange of commodities, with a view that both commodities
might be sold at each of their respective places of business.
Evidence of a decisive character is exhibited in the record to
show that the complainant or his predecessor knew throughout
what description of labels and trade-marks the respondent was
using; and it does not appear that any objection was ever made,
except as heretofore stated and explained. Once, the respond
ent was requested to insert the initials of his Christian name
before his surname, in the label; and it appears that he immediately complied with the request.
Cases frequently arise where a court of equity will refuse the
prayer of the complainant for an account of gains and profits,
on the ground of delay in asserting his rights, even when the
facts proved render it proper to grant an injunction to prevent
future infringement. Harrison v. Taylor, 11 Jur. wq. s. 408;
Cox, Trade-marks, 541.
Relief of the kind is constantly refused, even where the right
of the party to an injunction is acknowledged because of an
infringement, as in case of acquiescence or want of fraudulent
intent. Doet v. Couston, 83 Bear. 578; .Edelsten v. -delsten,
