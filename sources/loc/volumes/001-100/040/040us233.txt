THE STATE oFRHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS,
COMPLAINANTS, v. THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS

The state of Rhode Island filed a bill against the commonwealth of Massachusetts,
claiming that the b~oundary between the two states should be settled by the Supreme
Court, according to the provisions of the original charters of the states, respectively;
stating that the line which had been agieed upon by the commissioners acting for
the states while colonies, had been agreed to by the commissioners of Rhode Island,
under a mistake, and setting forth the charters of both the states, the proceedings of
the commissioners, the acts of the legslatures respectively, and many other matters
connected with the sjbject in controversy. To this bill the state of Massachusetts
entered a general demurrer. The demurrer was overruled.
It is one of the most familiar duties of a Court of Chancery to relieve against mi;take;.
especially where it has been produced by the misrepresentations of the adverse party..
The demurrer of the state of MaSsachusetts to the bill of Rhode Island, admits the charter lines of both the states to have been three miles south of Charles river;. t4at the
place marked, and from which the line was agreed to be.run, was seven miles south
of the river, instead of three miles, and was fixed on by mistakh; and that the commissioners of Rhode Island were led into this error by confiding irthe misrepresentations of the commissioners of Massachusetts. Now if this mistake had been diico- vered a few days after the agreement was made, and Rhode Island-had immediately.
gone before a tribunal having competent jurisdiction "torelieve against a mistake
committed by such parties, can there be any doubt that the agreement would have
been set aside, and Rhode Island restored to the true charter line! Agreementthus
obtained, cannot deprive the complainant of territory which belonged to her, tinless
she has forfeited her title to relief, by acquiescence Qrunressonable delay.
In the bill of Rhode Island, claiming to have an adjustment of the boundary between
her and the state of Massachusetts, allegations are made of the interference of certain
causes which prevented her resorting tb*measures for relief against a mistake as to
the boundary line, alleged to have been established by the commissioners of Rhode
Island and Massachusetts. The state of Massachusetts, by the demurrer, admits
these facts as stafed ; and the facts asserted in the bill of Rhode Island must be taken
as true. It is, therefore, not necessary to decide whether they are*ssfficient to excuse
the'delay. But when it is admitted by the demurrer th~at Rhode Island never acquiesced, but haa from time to time made efforts to regain the territory by negotiations with Massachusetts, and was prevented by the circumstances she mentions,
from appealing to the proper tribunals to grant her redress, the Court cannot under.
take to say the possession of Massachusetts has been such as to give her a title by
prescription; or that the laches of Rhode Island has been such as to forfeit her right
to the interposition of a Court of Equity.
In cases between individuals, where the statute of limitations would be a bar at law,
,the same rule is undoubtedly applied in a'Court of Equity. And where the fact
appears on the face of the bill, and no circumstances are stated which takie the case
u 2
30 -

234

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

out of the operation of the act, the defendant may, undoubtedly, take advantage of it
by demurrer; and is not bound to plead or answer.
The time necessary to operate as a bar in equity, is fixed at twenty years by analogy
to the statute of limitations.
It would be impossible to adopt the same rule of limitations in the case before the
Court on these pleadings. Here two political communities are concerned, who cannot
act with the same promptnes as individuals. Other circumstances in the case interpose objections. The boundary, in question, was in a wild, unsettled country, and
the error iifixing the line not likely to be discovered until, the lands were granted by,
the respective colonies; and the settlements approached the disputed line. And the
only tribunal that could relieve, after the mistake was discovered in 1740, was on
the other side of the Atlantic, and was not bound to hear the cause and proceed to
judgment, except when it suited its own convenience. The same-reasons that prevent the bar of limitations, make it equally evident that a possession so obtained and
held by Massachusetts, under such, circumstances, cannot give a title by prescription.

THIS case was before the Court, at -January term, 1838, 12
Peters, 657; and again, at'January term, 1840, 14 Peters, 210.
A bill was filed in the Supreme Court, on the 16th of March,
1832, by the state of Rhode Island, and Providence Plantation,
asking the Court to settle the boundaTy between that state and
the commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Mr. Webster appeared for the commonwealth of Massachusetts.
After various proceedings in the case, a plea and answer to the
bill of the state of Rhode Island were filed by the commonwealth

of Massachusetts; and, at January term, 1838, Mr. Webster,
counsel for the commonwealth of Massachusetts, "moved to dis-

miss the bill, on the ground that the Supreme Court had no jtrisdiction in the cause." A full report of the matters contained in
the bill, and in the plea and answer, will be found in 12 Peters,
659-669.

The question of jurisdiction was argued by Mr. Austin, Attorney General of Massachusetts, and Mr. W6bster, on the part of
the commonwealth of Massachusetts; and by Mr. Hazard and
Mr. Southard, for the state of Rhode Island.
TheL Court ordered that the motion to dismiss the bill of the
complainants should be overruled.
Afterwards, at the same term, 12 Peters, 755, Mr. Webster, in
behalf of the state of Massachusetts, as her counsel and attorney
in Court, moved for leave to withdraw the plea Aled in"
the case

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

235

[Rhbde Island v. Massachusetts.]

on the part of the state of Massachusetts, and also the appearance which had been entered for the state.
The Court, after argument, on the 24th Feb. 1838, 12 Peters,
761, ordered, "That if the counsel for the state of Massachusetts
shall elect to withdrawv the appearance heretofore entered, that
leave for the same be and was given; and the state of Rhode
Island may proceed ex parte. But that, if the appearance be
not withdrawn, that then, as no testimony had been taken,.the
parties be allowed to withdraw or amend the pleadings, under
such order as the Court should thereafter make in the premises.
The appearance of the state of Massachusetts was not withdrawn; and the case was argued, on the sufficiency of the .plea,
at January term, 1840: the bill of the complainants having
been amended.

14 Peters, 210.

On the 8th of January, 1841, the state of Massachusetts, by
Mr. Aistin,;he Attorndy General of the Commonwealth, apd
Mr. Webster, "for himself," filed: the following demurrer t, the
complainant's bill:
The defendant, by protestation, not confessing all or any of the
matters and things in the complainante bill of cdmplaint contained' to be true, doth demur to the said bill) and: for cause of
demurrer, showeth:
"1That no case is stated by the bill authorizing this Court to
grant the relief sought, or any other relief;
That no such mistake or fraud is averred in the bill, as is sufficient to set aside the awards and agreements between. the
parties, therein stated, nor any other cYuse or reason sufficient for
that purpose; and that these awards and agreeinents concludethe question:
That the bill states nothing which can do away the effect of
the possession by Massachusetts up to the line asserted by her
to be the true line, which possession the bill itself admits to have
been continued for more than a century, and which possession is
itself conclusive on the title:
That the bill states no case for the interference of this Couirt,
with the line of division actually existing between two independent states, fixed by treaty, compact, or agreement between
them, and acquiesced in for a century, as is true of this case, according to the bill itself:

236

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

That this Court has no power or jurisdiction to disturb or interfere with a boundary line actually existing between two
states, well known and defined, and resting on early compact
and long continued acqui~scenc6 and possession, upon any allegation of fraud or mistake in the original transaction.
Wherefore, and for divers other good causes of demurrer, appearing in the said bill, the defendant doth demur thereto, and
asks the judgment of the Court, whether said defendant ought to'
be ordered to make any further or other answer to said bill; and
prays to be hence dismissed with costs."
The demurrer was argued by Mr. Austin, and Mr. Webster, for
the state of Massachusetts; and by Mr. Randolph, and Mr. Whipple, for the state of Rhode Island and Providence plantations.
Mr. Austin, for the respondents, in support of the dem irrer.
The object of the plaintiff is, by a decree of this Cour, to be
confirmed and established in the title, jurisdiction, and sovereignty, which she sets up to a portion of territory, now and ever heretofore, in the possession, jurisdiction,, and sovereignty of the
respondent.
The bill describes this disputed territory with reasonable accuracy, so that it is seen to be included between the present
actual southern boundary of Massachusetts, and a line nearly
parallel thereto, drawn between three and four miles due north
from it, along the whole border of Rhode Island, comprising an
area of about one hundred square miles.
The bill does not state that this territory is densely inhabited,
and under a high state of improvenmnt; but if the Court could
judicially understand. that it is occupied by seven thousand
people, all of whom, as did their ancestors to remotest time,
deem themselves tobe citizens, and most of then native citizens
of Massachusetts; and that there is upon it not less than a million
of dollars of taxable property ; the importance of the contr6versy could not be doubted.
' The bill sets forth the alleged title of Rhod, Island to the territory in dispute, and claif's it as included in the charter of
Charles II. It describes accurately the title of Massachusetts
to the territory secured to her by her colonial and provincial
charters, the one granted in 1629, dnd the other id 169J ;. and a!-

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

237

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

leges that her southern boundary is by a line, "tbree English
myles on the south parte of the rivir called Charles rivir, or of
any or every parte thereof;" and further alleges that the southern
boundary of Massachusetts, and the northern boundary of Rhode
Island, is by the same line; the one being contiguous to the
other. All this is true.
The bill avers that the actual line of possession on the part of
Massachusetts, is more than three miles; viz.: seven miles south
of Charles river, and of any and every part thereof. On this
allegation, it is obvious the whole assumed merits of the plaintiff's case depend. If it he not true, there is no pretence of right
to disturb the ancient and existing possession of the respondent.
Whether it be true or not, in point of fact, must depend on a
legal construction of the words of the charter. As illustrative of
that question, and not in the present aspect of the case, for any
purpose of deciding it, the maps and plans of the territory heretofore used, and now before the Court, may be referred to.
By universal admission, the Charles river has one main, or
principal stream, whicli is supplied by other streams or branches.
If these latter streams, which have also. local names, are any
part of Charles river within the meaning of the charter, then the
actual line of Massachusetts, which is within three rmiles of the
principal branch, (sometimes locally called Mill river, at others,
Jack's Pasture brook;) is the true boundary by her charter. If.
the main stream, and not the head waters, is alone entitled to be'
termed "Charles river, or any and every part thereof," then unquestionably the actual line of Massachusetts is not in conformity with the charter; because, in ancient times, it was assumed,
and now is believed to be true, that the true point of offset for
the protraction, southwardly of the line of three miles from any
part of Charles river, is from the most southerly stream, branch,
or head waters of the river, and it was accordingly so drawn.
It is believed jhat such is, and ever was the universal acceptance
of the terms; and that wherever a different construction was put
on the like phraseology, it was the construction made by poiver
in violation of right.
But the case now stands before the Court on demurrer; and
in this form of pleading, the counsel for Massachusetts very well
understand that this question of fact is not open to discussion.

238

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.1

They are bound by the allegations of the bill, and must proceed
to a hearing with this fact, pro hac vice, against them; and with
an admission that the line of actual possession is not the true
line of the charter. It is with full confidence in the opinion that
the bill, (even admitting this great and fundamental error on the
part of Rhode Island, to be received as she has stated it,) does
not set forth a sufficient cause for the interposition of this Court;
that Massachusetts has ventured to waive this consideration for
the present; and to deny that even on this presumption, Rhode
Island has any title, by her own showing, to the territorial jurisdiction which she demands by her bill. We suppose, indeed,
this is already settled by this Court in effect, though not in form.
The bill incorporates the defence of Massachusetts, on two other
points; Which, independent of the original accuracy of the boundary, are each, by itself, fatal to the plaintiff's.demand. It admits
the fact of an amicable settlement in 1710 and 1718, and the
further fact of an actual possession on the part of Massachusetts,
under and by virtue of such agreements, for now nearly a century and a half.
It is again obvious that the'question of right between these
parties depends,
1st. On the original correct location of the boundary line.
2d. On the effect of the agreements in establishing a boundary.
3d. On the undisturbed possession for more than one hundred
years.
On the former hearing in this case, the respondent had filed a
plea in bar, setting out, more fully than the plaintiff had done,
the agreements of 1710, 1718; and relying up them as fair and
perfect contracts, made fairly, with full and equal knowledge,
and accompanied and followed by an undisturbed possession
from the time they were made.
We understood the Court to overrule th9 t plea, because it
contained two defences instead of one'6; upon a strict application
of the severest rules of chancery practice, which, with great
respect, we had contended could not apply to a case like the
present, and were in no case applicable to the plea in the fbrm
in which it was presented.

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

239

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts]
In pronouncing the opinion of the Court, the Chief Justice
said, "The defence set up by the plea is twofold:
1st. That there was an accord and compromise of a disputed
right.
2d. Prescription, or an unmolested possession for more than
one hundred years.
These two defences are entirely distinct, and depend upon
different principles."
And after coisidering them separately, the Chief Justice
further remarks, "Here, then, are two defences in the same plea,
contrary to the established rules of pleading."
And again, upon the form of pleading, the opinion of the
Court is to the following effect:
"A plea in general supposes that the bill contains equitable
matter, which the defendant, by his plea, seeks to displace. It
is according tb this principle of equity pleading that we have
treated the case before us. If a defendant supposes that there
is no equity in the bill, his appropriate answer to it is a demurrer;
which brings forward at once the whole case for argument.
The case of Milligan v. Mitchell, 3 Cranch, 220. 228, illustrates
this rule, and shows that the defence here taken was more proper
for an answer or demurrer than a plea.
"If the defendant supposes. that the bill does not disclose a
case which entitles Rhode Island to the relief she seeks, the whole
subject can be brought to a hearing by a ddmurrer to the bill.
The whole case is open, and upon the rule to answer which
the Court will lay upon the defendant; Massachusetts. is entirely
at liberty to demur or answer, as. she may deem best for her
interests."
It seemed to us that the Court, having thus decided, not, indeed,
that we had the two valid defences set forth. in our plea, but
that, if in truth we did possess them, either was in itself a bar,
though both could not be joined in the then present form; permitted, if they did not invite us to present them under such form
as would authorize a joinder of both, and a consideration of
either, independent of the other We had hope, therefore, that
the plaintiff, having, as we think, admitted both in his own

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhodei-sland v. Massachusetts.]

declaration, would have been satisfied that whenever they were
considered they would of necessity prevail.
The demurrer now joined preseuts these defences, with all
others growing.out of the plaintiff's own statement of the case.
It is a-familiar *and well established principle, that if, taking the
allegatins to be true, the bill would be dismissed at the-hearing,
it may be dismissed on demurrer. Utterron v. Mair, 2 Ves. Jr.
95. The object of a hearing is only to inquire whether the
allegations are proved, and the effect of them. When, therefore,
if proved or confessed, a decree Inust be had for defindant; the
defendant may safely admit them, and may therefore as safely
demur to the-whole bill. Kemp v. Prior, 7 Ves. Jr. 245. Brooke
v. Hewitt, 3" Ves. Jr. 253. Verplank v. Cacuis, 1 N. Y. Cases
in Chancery, 59. Unquestionably, the legal effect of the facts
admitted by denurrer or proof, may be a subject difficult to settle;
but, in a clear case of want of title, or equity, the result of a
d6murrer must be in favour of the defendant.
. If, therefore, it shall now appear to the Court, by the fair import of the plaintiff's admissions in his bill, that notwithstanding
any departure from the chartep.boundary, for good and sufficient
cause, the colonies of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, ly their
authorized agents, settled the location of boundary on this frontier, such settlement is valid; and the Court must dismiss the
bill.
Again, it appears to the counsel of Massachusetts, that if without any regard to the unascertained line described on paper in
the charter of King Charles I., or any regard to any claim or
any settlement with her neighbours, Massachusetts, in ancient
times, entered on the disputed territory, more than one hundred
and thirty years ago, and has always possessed it, and exercised
jurisdiction over it; that a title has been acquired by that possession, independent Lof all other title by grant or agreement,
which this Court will not disturb. If the supposed agreement
and th6 possession, or either of them, are admitted by the bill, it
is then apparent on the face of the bill that the plaintiff has no
cause of complaint, and on demurrer, the bill may be dismissed.
But in addition to these points of defence, the defendant has
yet another on the face of the bill. The plaintiff, to-recover,
must depend on the strength of his own title, not on the weak-

JANUARY TERM, 1841

241

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

ness' of the defendant's. The plaintiffs' title is set forth in the
bill. It mainly depends on the charter granted to Rhode Island
by Charles I., on 8th July, 1663.
Now, i'under the circumstances of the case set out in the bill,,
at the time this charter was granted, the disputed territory was
not in law created a part of the colony of Rhode Island then
established, the plaintiff must fail on demurrer.
That it never passed by such charter to the then new. colony
of Rhode Island, w'e think could be made very clear by other
records and proceedings, which history has preserved; but
the question for this Court to settle on the present state of the
pleadings will be, how does the title of the plaintiff appear on
her own allegation in her bill?
It is proposed, therefore, to sustain the following propositions.
I. That, on the face of the bill, it sufficiently appears that the
colony of Rhode Island, and Providence Plantations, never had
and charter title to the territory demanded.
I. That this territory never was any part of the state of Rhode
Island.
III. That by the bill it sufficiently appears that if her title, as
now claimed, ever vested by charter, still it is lost by force of the
agreements of January, 1710, and October, 1718, and the proceedings of May, 1719" set forth therein.
IV. That there has been an adverse possdssion of,more than
one hundre4.'ygars, apparent by the bill, which is conclusive
against any 9ther claimiof'title.
In considering the bill with. reference to these propositions,
two rules of law have an important bearing.,
1. That although a demurrer admits all the' facts well pleaded;
it admits facts only, and not the conclusions of law. Ford v.
Peering, 1 Ves. Jr. 76. 78. 2 Madox Chanc. 224.
2. The plaintiff can have no better case on proof; and no
remedy for any other case, than is stated in her bill.
This principle, however familiar, is in its exact application
exceedingly important in this case. It has recently received the
attention of this Court. Boon v. Childs, 10 Peters, 209. See
also 4 Mad. R. 21. 29. 3 Wheaton, 527. 6 Wheaton, 418. 2

VOL. XV.-X'

SUPREME COURT.
JRhode Island v. Mi~sehusetts.]

To the first point then. How does Rhode Island claim the
premises? Her title to any thing rests on her charter from
Charles II., dated 8th July, 1663. In this charter she has no
northern boundary, by natural objects or line of latitude. She is
bounded on- the southerly'line of the Massachusetts colony or
plantation. Where that line was, must b'e ascertained by examining the colony and plantation of Massachusetts; and in this
position of the cause, it is admitted that the bill furnishes the
only evidence. But it is well enough there stated. The colony
of Massachusetts is the elder by thirty-five years. All thd charters are set out in the bill. First, Is the grant of King James to
the council of Plymouth, in 1621, in which the southern boundary -is described as "lying within the- space of three English
miles on the south part of the said Chdrles river, or of any, or
of every, part thereof."
Next is the deed of the council of Plymouth, to Sir Ienry
Rosewell and others, 19th of March, 1628, with the same boundary. Again follows the confirmation deed of Charles I., dated
4th of March, 1629, with the same description. Boston was
settled in 16d0, and the mouth of Charles river is on the west
side-of the city. Thre.e miles south of it, would extend to Brookline, about thirty miles more northerly than the present claim of
Rhode Island. It is not from the mouth of the river then, that
the:offset of three miles is to be drawn. At.that period, and for
many years after, the river was unexplored. The ancient maps,
if it was proper to examine them, are all ruarvellously inaccurate.
Iii 1646,. two persons called Woodward and Saffrey, and denominated "skilful approved artists ;" with or without authority,
went into the interior to explore the country, make a map of it;
(the map is before us, and has been lithographically copied by
the council of plaintiff;) find the south branch of Charles river,
measure three miles, and erect a monument in perpetual remembrance of the thing. All this they did. The bill shows it.
They established the boundary, to begin in latitude 410 55'.
The monument; the supposed boundary; the line thence to be
drawn; became known and notorious.
Governor Dudley, of Massachusetts, on a solemn occasion,
sixtya-eight years after, proclaimed it. Governor Jenks, of Rhode

JANUARY TERM,. 164L

243

[Rhoae Island v. Massachusetts.]

Island, on the same occasion admitted it. All this is apparent
on the bill.
This demarcation, and the notoriety of it, at that ancient time,
in the wilderness , when it was important to draw a line, but of
n importance where it should be drawn, was a -practical consiruction of the charter, conclusive against all the world, -unless
indeed, the King of England might be an exception. He never
objected, and his silence was consent.
Massachusetts, as the bill shows, being thus for twenty-one
years without a neighbour, settled up to ,and, in the language lof
that day, planted towards the line. Then the charter of Rhode
Island was granted by' Charles II., bounding the colony of Rhode
Island on the southerly line of the "Massachusetts colony or
plantation," making no mention of the Massachusetts charter;
but assuming, by this new word "Plantation," for the first time
applied to Massachusetts, that her actual occupation was her
charter limits. The colony of Massachusetts was established by
the royal charter, the plantation by the act of the people. The
charter of Rhode Island, recognises the existence of Massachusetts
as, at that time, she existed in fact.
. If 'the grant to Rhode Island was iniended to include the
space north of Woodward and Saffrey's station, which is nowhere so declared in the bill, and cannot be supposed, it would
not convey.any title from a grantor out of potsession, and could
therefore give, in this disputed territory, no claim to the colony.
It is fairly to be inferred, that when a new colony was to be
erected at the south of Massachusetts, aid was bounded on the
said colony or plantation, all the facts of the case were known;
and that the boundary was intended to conform to an existing
state of things, which had so long been possessed under a demand
of right.
For forty-three years, the colony of Rhode Island submitted
and acquiesced in this location Now, although the title by possession forms a distinct subject of inquiry; yet, here it may be
invoked, to show that Rhode Island took no part of this territory
by her" coloniai charter. A charter, without possession under'it,
can form no evidence of title after the revocation of that charter,
on the 4th of July, 1776. It is believed that the.great respect paid

244

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

by this Court, in repeated cases, to the validity of crown grants,
has not extended to give validity to any grant 'of which actual possession was not taken in a reasonable time; and that
an adverse possession submitted to for forty-three years, is conclusive evidence that the territory in such adverse possession
was not included in the terms of any other grant.
IL If this territory never passed to the colony, the state never
had title to it; the claim of, the state being only as successor to
the colony.
III. It appears on the face of the bill, that a dispute arose
between the two colonies in 1710, in regard to this line; and was
settled by agreements or treaties of compromise, in 1710, 1718,
1719,

The bill distinctly alleges, 1st. A dispute or controversy.
2d. A commission to settle the controveisy, commonly called
the Roxbury commission.
3d. An unlimited authority to the commissioners of each colony
by the legislature of each colony, to ascertain and settle the line.
4th. An actual settlement by an agreement, signed and sealed
by the commissioners, so far as to fix a point of beginning; and
to establish Woodward and Saffrey's monument as such point.
5th. That this settlement was a compromise;
Massachusetts
yielding one mile of soil in fee, and Rhode Island withdrawing
all claim to jurisdiction over the disputed territory.
And thebill further admits a second commission, arbitrament,
and award, or, more properly, a treaty; commonly called the
Rehoboth agreement, by which other commissioners were appointed, with unlimited powers, to agree and settle the line "in
the best manner they could;" and an agreement, as before, under
seal, varying in some degree from the former, bit precise, exact,
and particular, and a subsequent running of the line accordingly,
upon the earth's surface, being the line which, from that time to
this, has been the actual dividing line between the two parties;
and which the plaintiff now seeks to disturb. Having thus introduced the defendant's title into her bill, the plaintiff seeks to
avoid it by several allegations. It is suggested not to have been
within the legitimate power of the colonies to make an- agreement of boundary. To this, the case of Penn v. Lord Baltimore, 1 Ves. 444, is a sufficient answer.

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

245

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

The most material allegation is, that the agreement or treaty
was the effect of a mistake. This mistake is thus stated.
The Massachusetts commissioners represented to the Rhode
Island commissioners that Woodward and Saffrey were skilful
and approved artists, and in 1642 had ascertained the point or
place three miles south of Charles river, or of any and everyr
part thereof; and had thre set up a stake; and the Rhode Island
commissioners, relying on said representations, and believing'
them to be true, and verily believing the said point, or place to
have been correctly ascertained, and the said place where the
said stake was alleged to have been set up as aforesaid, to have
been three English miles from Charles river and no more; the
commissioners signed and sealed the agreement, which established the line of boundary..
To this the respondent replies, that it is the true character of
this transaction, and not the name given to it in the plaintiff's
bill, that is to lay the foundation for annulling an agreement
otherwise binding upon the contracting parties.
The facts alleged are' adinitted by the demurrer; but whethet
they are .to be called, or whether they amount to a mistake, is'
a conclusion of law, to be determined by the Court.
Now it is certain that to settle the boundary according to
those charters, the commissioners must first have decided whether
the head waters were a part 6f Charles river. It is apparent,
also, that Woodward and Saffrey had, in their proceedings,
determined that the head waters were part of the- river; they
had set up their stake accordingly, and when the Massachusetts
commissioners affirmed that it was in the right place, they only
affirmed that the head waters were part of the river; and when
the. Rhode Island commissioners relied on said affirmation, and
believed it to be true, they believed the same fact.
It is observable, that the bill nowhere declares that the repre-"
sentatioh so ma-de by the Massachusetts commissioners was
wilfully false, or was intended to deceive, or that the Rhode
Island commissioners acted or believed in cotnsequence of such
representation. These material allegations are carefully avoided.
It does not appear lhat the Rhode Island colony intended to
settle the line according to the charter, kvithout variation; but, on
.the contrary,.that the commission was to "revise and comprox2!

946

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Massachuset&]

misc." It is not averred that the Rhode Island commissioners
intended to conform to the charter; but, on the contrary, it appears
they were disposed to make an amicAble settlement, and. to take,
in fee simple, an eqiivalent for territorial jurisdiction.
It is thus plain, on the averments of the bill, that what the
plaintiff has beeu pleased to term mistake, was knowledge, compromise, reasonable concession, and judicious settlement.
All the subsequent proceedings having reference to this, depend on the same facts, and are not materially varied by the
form of the bill.
But if this was a mistake by these commissioners, what is its
equitable effect? "It must-not be understood that in equity
every kind of mistake is relievable, for though equity will relieve
against a plain mistake, or misapprehension, or ignorance of title,
yet equity will not interpose if th.e fact is doubtful, or, at the time
of the contract, equally unknown to both parties; or'if'there has
been a long acquiescence under the mistake, and neither party
aware of it." Fonblanque, vol..i. p. 116, note to book i., ch. 2,
see. 7.
It appears by the bill that Rhode Island reposed under this
mistake for forty years, without discovering her wrongs.
But this agreement and the subsequent ones are, treaties.

There can be found few-cases where the negotiators of a treaty
of boundary are supposed to have made a mistake; and none, it
is believed, where, for any such cause, the provisions of a treaty

were ever deemed to be, or ever were suggested by diplomatists
to be void.
It is part of the law of nations, that a treaty, once made, is
irremediably conclusive. And the reason is, that it can be inquired about and explained only by itself. The peace of the
world demands that it be an eternal estoppel between the
parties.

of 1783; the designation of the River St. Croix, by commissioners under the Treaty of London, commonly called Jay's Treaty;
and the results of the commission under the 4th article of the
Treaty of Ghent, are all suspected, with more reason than the
ancient treaty line of these colonies, to have been settled by mistake ; but who ever was guilty of the gigantic.heresy of maintaining that a mistake could be inquired about in these national
compacts, or that the disoovery of the ignorance of the negotiators would nullify the contract?
The bill shows an undisturbed possession by Massachusetts
for one hundred and thirteen years, under claim of title.
The controlling power of time is a part of the law of this
case, and reference is made to the authorities cited at the former
hearing.
In addition to these, there is now presented to this Court the
written autographic opinion of Lord Mansfield, when Attorney
General of England, in the year 1754, on the subject of this very
boundary; in which that eminent jurist declares that "if the king
approves the agreement, it is now too rate for the pariies' to dispute it." 4th vol. Trumbull's MS. papers, Mass. His. Soc. Li-'
brary.
Possession alone,,it is respectfully contended, in a case of this
kind, uninterrupted and exclusive for more than a century, is
not only a good title, but the best of all possible titles. No other
title gives, or was ever pretended to give, any right to the British
crown to make conveyance of land or empire, jurisdiction or
sovereignty in this new world. By discovery or by conquest,
possession was obtaii~ed, and hene possession became ultimate
right. When this possession was parted with, the right was lost,
at least in effect against all the rest of mankind 'but the royal
authority. Now, this possession was lost to the crown, and wa
gained by Massachusetts before the colony of Rhode Island was
planted, or her charter drawn upon parchment. It is against,
therefore, her own possessionl, or the possession of her grantor,
forever, that the plaintiff demands title.
'It has been suggested that it is not against claim of possession.
To this it is submitted that no claim of possession can ever be
admitted or cornsidered ih-a- Court of Equity, but that claim that

is made in conformity to judicial proceedings.

While this prin-

ciple is universally true, it derives additional force from the fact,
that there-always was a paramount power capable of redressing
the injuries of the plaintiff, if at any time such injuries have been
made-known.
Froin 1740 to 1776 there was a regular appeal allowed to the
King in Council, From the adoplion of the confederation until
the existence of the Constitution of the United States, authority
to redress such injury vested in Congress. From that time to the
present, this high Court has been the arbiter of international
controversies between the states of the Union. The bill admits
that no judicial effort has'been made to bring the dispute to an
issue. Occasionally, indeed, Rhode Island has complained.
Once in about every thirty-five or forty years; that is, once in
every generation of statesmen, of which her soil has been prolific,
she moaned over the loss of a right which she never possessed;
but her murmurs never reached the temple of the law, and never
were serious enough, or loud enough for that purpose.
She was too weak, or too feeble, or too poor, it may seem by
the bill; and although we would not hear her enemy say this;
yet; if it be admitted by demurrer,it is mere admission by form;
for she never wanted the intellectual" or moral qualities whinh
such an exigency demanded.
Bht the admission of her distress may be safely made. It is

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

Mr. Whipple, for the complainants; with whom was Mr.
RandolphThe object of the plaintiff's bill is to obtain possession of
jurisdiction over a territory about four and a half miles wide,
north and south, by about twenty miles long, east and west.
This territory constitutes, we say, the northern border of Rhod
Island, and is included in the charter granted to Rhode Island, by
the crown of England.
On the contrary, it is contended by Massachusetts, that this
territory constitutes her southern border, and is included in her
charter. The object of the controversy, therefore, is to settle
the dividing line between two coterminous states, so far as it
involves the rights of the parties to jurisdiction. The right to
the soil is not in dispute.
Massachusetts has demurred to' the whole of the plaintiff's
bill; and the question is,
whether, taking the case as it is presented by that bill, Rhode Island is entitled to relief. The first and
most obvious inquiry, therefore, is, what are the facts set forth in
the bill ?
The leading and prominent facts are, 1'st, The charters of the
crown to the two states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
By the Massachusetts charter, her southeri line or boundary, is
declared to be "within the space of three English myles on the
south parte of the saide river called Charles river, or of any, or
every, parte thereof." The northern boundary, or line, of Rhode
Island, is declared by her charter to be, "And from thence by a
straight line, drawn due north until it meets the south line of the
Massachusetts colony; and on the north, or northerly, by the
aforesaid south, or southerly, line of Massachusetts."
By the Massachusetts charter, dated in 1629, the said Henry
Rosewell et al. are created "A corporation by the name of the
G'vernor and Company of Massachusetts Bay;" "which said
officers shall apply themselves to take care for the best disposing
and ordering of the general business and affairs of, for, and concerning the said lands and premises hereby mentioned, to be
granted, and the plantation thereof, and the government of the
people thereof." It then provides for f6ur meetings of the general Court each year, and authorizes them "To make laws and
ordinances for the good and welfare of said company, and for

250

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

the government and ordering of the said lands and plantatiQns,
and the people inhabiting, and to inhabit, the same."
The same emphatic language is used in the Rhode Island
charter. It cr'eates the freemen of Rhode Island a corporation
.with perpetual succession; prescribes the times and mode of
choosing the Governor and members of the legislative assembly;
and authorizes the Assembly "from time to time to make, ordain, &c., such laws, &c., for the government of the lands here-'
inafter granted, and for the government of the people who now
inhabit, or may hereafter inhabit, the same." "To establish
Courts to settle all matters within said colony."
Both char ters, in their grants of legislative, executive, and
judicial powers, closely and cautiously limit the exercise of those

themselves differ very materially 'as to their
terms of
the
very
granted to Massachusetts, and none other, by
the Massachusetts charter are to be exercised within "the said
lands," described in the Massachusetts charter, and by officers
chosen by the freemen of Massachusetts. The powers granted
to Rhode Island, and none other, by the very terms of the Rhode
Island charter, are to be exercised within "th'e said lands hereinafter mentioned," and by officers chosen by the freemen of
Rhode Island. "And, further, our will and pleasure is, that in
all matters of public controversy which may fall out between
our colony of Providence Plantations, and the rest of our colonies in New England, it shall and may be lawful to and for
our said colony of Providence Plantations, to make their appeals
therein to us, our heirs and- successors, for the redress of their
grievances, in England."
By these charters the following important facts are established,
1st. That the first settlers of Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, were not independent individuals, tribes, or communities,
-who took possession by conquest, or otherwise, for themselves,
otei their respective territories, claiming and aiquiring an original and inherent power of legislation therein-; a power which
they could consequently transfer to each other or to any third
person or community.
2d. They took possession as subjects of the crown of England,
of a portion of a country claimed to have been discovered by

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

251

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]
England; they took possession for, and under the crown of
England: that all the poxkers of"]ugislation which they ever
claimed, or exercised, was by express grants from the. crown.;
that by accepting these grants-they acknowledged the power of
legislation to be in the crown; that to Massachusetts was, grantled the power to legislate over lands as far south as "three miles
south of Charles river, and of any and every Part-thereof;"
that to Rhode Island was granted the power to legislate as far
north a& the southernmost line f Massachusetts; that the power
to legislate north of that line, was delegated by the Massachusetts chartef to Massachusetts officers, who were to be chosen
by Massachusetts freemen in a certain mode; that the power to
legislate soutfir-of thiat line was delegated by the Rhode Island
charter, to Rhode Island officers to be chosen by Rhode Island
-freemen in a different mode; that both these powers were entire
powers, to be exercised by each in the mode, by the officers
chosen, and at the. times specified in the respective charters; that
Massachusetts must exercise the powers over the lands, and all.
the lands specified in her charter; that Rhode Island was subject
to the same rule ; that, consequently, it ivas not competent for
either Massachusetts or Rhode Island, by any agreement (not
ratified by the crown) to vary those powers, or to enlarge or lessen the teir'tory ever which they were to be exercised; that in
this respect they were like all other corporations, and like most
other colonial gGvernments; that the right to legislate was in
the crown, the temporary exercise of it, alone, was in the colonies; and this exercise might be terminated at the pleasure of
the crown.
There was not only no authority in the charters of either of
these colonies to delegate any portion of their derivative powers;
but there is an implied if not a positive prohibition against it,
for in "all matters of public controversy which may fall out
between our colony of Providence Plantations, nd the rest of
our colonies in New Efigland, it shall and ma be lawful to
make their appeal to us, in England."
No subject can be considered of "public controversy" with
more propriety than a dispute between two colonies in regard
to their boundaries. Indeed it is impossible to reconcile the studied and cautious limitation of the powers granted, even down

-

252

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

to those almost of a police nature, with the supposition of a
power to cede any portion of their territories. There was a
double incapacity. Rhode Island was incompetent to sell, and
Massachusetts incompetent to pitichase territory, the jurisdiction
over which was exclusively in the crown. It would be a startling proposition that Jamaica could cede to Bermuda the jurisdiction over a part of her island. Even the compromise of a
disputed line, would derive all its validity from the express or
implied ratification of the crown.
From these charters, then, we arm ourselves with the following
facts to start with:
1st. That Massachusetts and Rhode Island, from the date of
their charters, 1628 and 1663, down to 177$, were not soverdign
independent states, but political corporations, possessed, as trustees for the people, and by grant from the crown of England, of
jurisdiction over certain specified limits.;
2d. That neither of the charters contained any authority to
delegate this jurisdiction, or any portion of it, nor any authority
to acquire jurisdiction over any other lands than those specified
in their charters.
3d. That as these charters limit tihe south line of Massachusetts
to "three miles south of Charles river, and of any and every
part Ihereof," and grant to Rhode Island jurisdiction up to that
line; that Rhode Island is still entitled to that line, unless it
appears upon the face of this bill that it has been expressly ceded
to Massachusetts, by the crown of England, or by Rhode Island,
with the express or implied assent of the crown.
With this preparation we will approach the years 1710 and
1718, when the agreements, upon which Massachusetts relies,
were made. Those agreements are copied into the bill, and were
made by commissioners with full authority from the two states.
-. fter they were concluded by the commissioners, and the line
run in 1718, to which Massachusetts has ever since .claimed,
they were ac6epted by the legislatures of both states; but never
formally ratified. All the allegations in the bill, in relation to
those agreements, whether true or ur~true, in point of fact, must
be taken for truth for all the purpose-3 of this trial; because they
are admitted by the demurrer. One material allegation is, "that
a short time previoiis to the year 1709, the inhabitants of said

JANUARY TERM, 1S41.

253

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

colony of Rhode Island, entered upon certain parts of said lands
adjoining the northern boundary of said colony, and made improvements thereon, and grants thereof." The bill then states
the existence of disputes between the inhabitants of the two
states, in relation to the boundary line; arid that, in consequence
of said disputes between said inhabitants, the two colonial
governments appointed commissioners to 'ascertain and settle
the northern boundary line of said colony of Rhode Island; that
these commissioners met at Roxbury, on the 19th January, 1711.
"That the Massachusetts commissioners then and there represented to the Rhode Island commissioners, that Woodward and
Saffrey, skilful and approved artists, in 1642, had ascertained
the point or Place three English miles*south of the river called
Charles river, or of any and every part thereof, and had thdre
set up a stake; and that the said Rhode Island commissioners,
relying on said representations, and verily' believing the said
point or place to have been correctly ascertained, and. the said
place, where said stake was alleged to have been set up as aforesaid, to be three English miles, and no more, south of said Charles'
river, signed and sealed a certain viriting, called'an agreement
in the words following."
The agreement itself sets forth the authority of the two governments conferred upon the commissioners, and a statement of the
inducements to settle the dispute in an amicable manner, and
then proceeds to state, "That they have mutually agreed, that
the stake set up by Woodward ahd Saffrey, skilful approved
artists, in 1642, and since often renewed, in lat. 410 55', being
three English miles distant southward from' the southernmost part
of the river, called Charles river, agreeable to the letters-patent
for the Massachusetts province, be accompted and allowed on
both siaes, the commencement of the line between Massachusetts
and Rhode Island, and to be continued between the governments
in such manner as that, after it has proceeded between the two
governments, it may pa~s over Connecticut river, at or near
Bissel's house, as is decyphered in the plan and tract of the line
by Woodward and Saffrey, now shown forth to us, and is remaining upon record in the Massachusetts government.
The bill then states that disputes still continued to exist between
the inhabitants; that the boundary line still remained unsettled,
VOL. XV.-Y

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Mssanhusett&i

as said pretended agreement was never in any manner ratified
or confirmed by said colony of Rhode Island; that new commissioners -were appointed in 1717, with full powers to settle all
disputes.; that these commissioners met at Rehoboth, in October,
1718; that the Massachusetts bommissioners made the same
representations in r~gard to the Woodward and Saffrey stations,
being but three English miles -south of Charles river, as were
made by the former commissioners from Massachusetts; that
the Rhode Island commissioners, fully confiding in these representations, signed the second agreement, commonlyT known as
the Rehoboth agreement.
The agreement then states, "That the stake set up by Woodward and Saffrey, in 1642, upon Wrentham Plain, be the station
or commencement to begin the line which shall divide betwben
the two governments aforesaid; from which said stake, the line
shall run so as it may, at Connecticut river, be two and a half,
miles southward of a due west line, allowing the variation of
the compass to be nine. degrees: which said line shall forever
remain," &c.
The bill repeatedly states that the commissioners did not go
upon the ground, nor cause the distance from Charles river to be
meastiredf so as to ascertain whether the Woodward and Saffrey
station was but three miles from the river or not. It also states
that'neither of these agreements were ever ratified by the legislatures of either of the colonies; that both said agreements, and
all the proceedings of the Rhode Island legislature thereon, were
founded on the belief that the Woodw'ard and Saffrey station
had been ascertainied, by competent and skilful surveyors, to be
but three miles from Charles river, and no more;" that such mistaken belief continued to exist until 1749, when commissioners
were again appointed by both colonies. The act appointing the
Rhode Island commissioners is set out in the bill. Its preamble
is as follows':
"Whereas, the northern line of this colony has never been
settled according to the royal charter: and whereas, divers persons have made application to this assembly, and have set forth
their just right to be under the jurisdiction of this government,
as dwelling within the bounds thereof; and that the province of

JANUARY TERM, 1841

255

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

Massachusetts Bay have and do unjustly exercise jurisdiction
over them. In order, therefore," &c.
The Rhode Island commissioners met at Wrentham,after giving
the Massachusetts commissioners notice of the time and place;
and after waiting for them two days, they commenced measuring
the distance from the most southerly part of Charles river to the
Woodward and Saffrey station, the startifig point of the line
agreed upon by the commissioners in 1710 and 1718, and instead
of three miles from Charles rioter, as had been stated by the Massachusetts commissioners, and as was laid down upon the Woodward and Saffrey map, they found it to be over seven miles.
These commissioners measured three miles due south from the
most southerly part of Charles river, and from the .point extended
a lihe due west until it reached the Connecticut line. Upon this
east and west line, only three,miles south of Charles river, they
erected various monuments. The Massachusetts commissioners
refused any participation in the measurement of the distance of
three miles south of Charles river, but adhered to the line established four miles farther south, by the agreements of 1710
and 1718.
Three lines, then, have been run between these, two states.
The first in 1710, by agreement of the commissioners of both
parties, beginnifig at the Woodward and Saffrey station, "being
three miles south of Charles river, agreeable to the letters patent
for the Massachusetts province, and to be'continued between the
two governments in such manner that it may pass over Connecticut river at or near Bissel's house.".
- The second line was by the agreement of the commissioners
of the two states, in 1718, and starting-from the same point, the
Woodward and Saffrey station, "from which said stake the
dividing line shall run, so as i~t may, at Connecticut river, be
two miles and a half to the southward of a due west line."
These two qgreemeits differ materially in the course of the
line, the first termingting at the west end, several miles farther
south than the second.
Tfie third line was run by the Rhode Island commissioners
alone, (the Massachusetts commissioners having declined any
agency in it,) in 1750, and not only its termination at the west
end, but its commencement at the east end, was between four

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

.and five miles farther north than the two former lines. It is
alleged in the bill, that Rhode Island first discovered that the
Woodward and Saffrey station was over seven miles south of
Charles river, in 1749 or 1750, when this last line was run.
It is also alleged, in the bill, that Massachusetts took possession
as far south as the line established in 1719, immediately after
that period; and has been in the possession of the territory between that and the line run by the Rhode Island commissioners,
in 1750, ever since 1719.
It is also stated, as a fact, "that the place from which said line
was run, (the line of 1719,) was alid is more than seven miles
south of the river called Charles river, and of any and every
part thereof."
Upon the whole facts, as stated in the bill, and admitted by
the demurrer, the defendant contends that she is entitled to continue her possession of the disputed territory; 1st. Because jurisdiction over that territory, was ceded to her, by force of the
agreements of 1710, and 1718. 2d. Because, having been in
the actual possession of that jurisdiction, as the bill itself states,
from 1719, down to the filing'the bill in 1832, she has gained a
title to jurisdiction, by possession and prescription.
All the material and important facts in relation to the first
point: the legal effect of the agreements, standing by themselves,
have been stated; except the allegation distinctly nrade, that these
agreements were never ratified by the crown. We will now consider briefly the question, Ao these agreements, by themselves,
infer any right to jurisdiction, over the territory in dispute?
A recapitulation of the facts bearing upon the validity of these
agreements, may aid us in estimating the force of the opposite
argument.
1. Massachusetts admits, that her chartered line on the south,
is an east and west line, three miles south of Charles river; and
that the nortft line of Rhode Island, by her charter, is the south
line of Massachusetts. "Consequently, she admits, that, by the
express terms of the two charters, the territory in dispute belonged to Rhode Island, anterior to 1710, being all that territory*
lying more than three miles south of Charles rive'; and the
south line of it, as claimed, and occupied by Massachusetts,

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

257

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

"more than seven miles from Charles river, and from any and.
every part thereof."
2. She admits that the two agreements of 1710, and 1718, establishing the Woodward and Saffrey station, were entered into
under the representation by the Massachusetts commissioners,
that the station had been fixed and established by skilful surveyors, and was but three miles from Charles river; that the
map of these artists was produced by the Massachusetts commissioners, in confirmation of this representation; and that the
Rhode Island commissioners, confiding in this false representation, entered into these agreements, under the full belief that
said station was but three miles"from Charles river; and no more.
Massachusetts now admits that said station, and said line run
from it, were more than' seven miles from Charles river, and from
any and every part thereof.
3. She admits that these agreements were never ratified by the
crown of England; that the mistake was not discoverea by
Rhode Island, until 1749, or 1750, when her commissioners ran
a line three miles south of Charles river, its course due east and
west; and that Rhode Island his claimed to that line ever since.
These are the facts admitted by the pleadings, upon which the
validity and binding effect of the agreements depend.
. In the argument of that question, it has not been pretended,
that such agredments between two individuals, would be binding,
either in law or in justice. The misrepresentation of one ijarty,
and the mistake of the other, would render them a mere nullity.
The only ground i6pon which it is attempted to support them
is,
that they amount to a treaty between two sovereign'states ;
and that it is a principle of the laws of nations, that all treaties
are binding, whatever may have been the mistake of either
party
We do not admit the existence of any such rule among nations. A practical difficulty in annulling treaties between sovereign states, founded on mistake, may arise from the absence of
any common -arbiter between them. But suppose a common
arbiter, by the agreement of parties, fully authorized to settle
any question of boundary between two nations of sovereign and
mctependent power, and one of them should rely upon a treaty,
Y2
33

258

SUPREME COURT..
[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

which it admitted was founded in a mistake of the other party,
caused by its own misrepresentations; is there any tribunal in
the civilized world that would sanction such a treaty ? This
Court is a tribunal established by the Constitution, to decide all
such questions between the states, that have become parties to
that Constitution. Was it the intention and design of the Constitution, that this Court should decide without regard to any fixed
principles of law or justice? If a treaty between two states,
founded in admitted mistake, is binding, why not a treaty founded' in fraud? If fraud or mistake will not vitiate a treaty between states, will it vitiate any other contract? Without entering into this subject, we merely express one dissent to the whole
doctrine. Our'main answer to it is, that in 1710, and 1718,
Massachusetts and Rhode Island were not sovereign and independent states, but colonial governments, with powers of an extremely limited character. They were- trustees of legislative
powers, under a grant from another nation, made for the benefit
of the people.
No agreement in relation to their jurisdiction, even though made
fairly and understandingly, could bind the crown, until ratified
by the crown. How then could an agreement made under an
admitted mistake, be allowed a more binding efficacy, than
an agreement made understandingly? Besides, it is expressly
averred in the bill, that neither of these agreements were even
ratified by the crown; and the demurrer admits that fact.
We have not merely the admission of Massachusetts, that
these agreements were founded in mistake, but the mistake is
apparent on the face of the agreements themselves. ' The agreement of 1810, states, expressly, that they were to begin the line,
from the Woodward and Saffrey station, "being three English
miles distant from the southernmost part of Charles river, agreeable to the letters patent." There was never any dispute between
the parties, but that the line was to be three miles south of the
river, and no more. That was the agreed basis of the contract.
The only dispute was, what course that line should run; Rhode
Island contending for a due west course, and Massachusetts fora course south of west.
The question, therefore resolves itself into this; can an agreement founded -in -aiA acimitted mistaie or a mistake apparent

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

269

[Rhode Island v. Mauachusetts.]
upon the face of the instrument, be supported either in law or
equity? For a much stronger reason, can such an agreement
between parties, having no power to contract in relation to the
subject-matter, be supported ?
An omission in an agreement, by mistake, stands on the same
ground as an omission by fraud. Ramsbottom v. Gosden, 1 Ves.
and Beam. 168. 3 Atk. 388. 6 Ves. 334, note C.

from time. In the first place, time is no objection to relief,
where the mistake is admitted; -if the case arises between tle
original parties to the contract; and if the plaintiff has not misled
the ddfendant, by concealing the mistake an undue time, after it
was discovered. In the present case, it is admitted that'Rhode
Island disclosed the mistake as soon as it was discovered. It
comes within the principle of Honor v. Honor, 1 P. Williams,

260

SUPREME COURT.
[Rode Island v. Massachusetts.]

123; the mistake "being apparent on the face \of 'the papers,
length of time is immaterial."
In the second place, length of time, though i bar in some
cases to a claim for property, does not affect a claim for jurisdiction.
These are- questions, however, more proper to be discussed,
when the general merits of the case come before the Court, upon a
general denial of the plaintiff's bill. The principal question upon
these pleadings is, whether length of time can be taken advantage of, upon a demurrer? As this is a mere question of authority, we shall content ourselves with a reference to such cases
as bear most strongly upon the point.
Both in law and in equity, time has a twofold operation; often
confounded by unskilful persons; but possessing,*in reality, characters wholly distinct, and wholly unlike each other. In many
cases, it op.erates as a bar to the plaintiff's'remedy. In a class
of cases more numerous, it operates as a witness in favour of
the defendant. In this last mode of its operation, it has nothing
to do with the remedy, but it is applied to the-inerits of the,
plaintiff's claim.
I In its" first mode of operation, it is called a statute
of limita-,
tions; and unless the case is embraced by certain enumerated exceptions, such as infancy, coverture, and other disabilities, which
must be specially stated in answer to the special plea of the de-fendant, it is an unyielding and peremptory bar, to the plainiiff's
action, Still, the demand exists for certain purposes, although
the remedy is destroyed.. It still would form a sufficient cons1-deration for a new promise.
But, in its second mode of operation, it is not ne.cessary to plead
the lapse of time relied upon. It is introduced as,a witness in
the cause before the jury; and, like all other witnesses, its testi"mony may be contradicted.or qualified in a thousand ways,
:because it swears to matters of fact alone. Thus, in cases in
which twenty years operate as presumptive evidence of a grant;
the opposite party may disptove the existence of the grant, or
remove the presumption by any means in his power) and the'jury
are to judge of the weight of conflicting testimony.
But a plea of the statute of limitations, if admitted by the
plaintiff, that is, if he admits that the time h~s elapsed, and that

261

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

his case does not come within one of the specified exceptions, is
matter of mere law, to be decided by the Court. A statute of
limitations prescribes a definite time, six years, or twenty years,
beyond which no action can be brought. It operates alike in all
cases, and if the lapse of time is admitted, is fatal to the plaintiff's
case. No circumstances can ward off its unerring blow. But
when time operates as evidence addressed to a jury, tt! plaintiff
may safely admit the lapse of twenty, thirty, or fifty years, and
destroy its effect in a thousand different modes.
In Courts of Law, a statute of limitations must be specially
pleaded. Even if it appears upon the face of the declaration,
that more than the prescribed time has elapsed, still the defendant must present it anew, in a special plea. But in those cases,
in which Courts of Equity have concurrent jurisdiction with
Courts of Law, and in which a statute of limitations applies; if it
appear upon the. ace of the bill that the prescribed time has
elapsed, and the disabilities mentioned in the statute, are not
stated in the bill in avoidance of thie bar, the defendant may
demur to the bill. This *differencein the mode of pleading the
statute in the-two Courts is simply this, that in a Court of Law
the statute must be pleaded by the defendant, and the disabilities,
if any, introduced in the plaintiff's .replication. But in a Court
of Equity, if the lapse of time is apparent on the face of the bill,
the disabilities in avoidance must also be stated, otherwise the
defendant may demur to the whole bill.
In the case now under consideration, it is not pretended thattime operates as a bar. If the case had been on the law side of
the Court, there is no statute of limitations that could be pleaded
in bar to -the remedy. There is no provision in any statute in
England, or this country, applicable to the subject-matter of this
suit, jurisdiction, nor to the parties, sovereign states.. Timd,
therefore, can only come to the aid of the defendant as a witness,
to prove possession on the part of the defendant, and acquiescence
on the part of the plaintiff. Like all other witnesses, his testimony must be offered to the jury upon an issute of fact, and not
to' the Court upon an issue of law.
In the case of Deloraine v. Brown, 3 Brown's Ch. Cases, 646,
(London edition of 1819, by Eden,) is a note of Lord Thurlow'

260

SUPREME COUT.
[Rhode-Island v. Massachusetts)

opinion, preserved by Redesdale, which places this question in
its true light.
"(The party who demurs," said his lordship, "admits every
thing that is well pleaded, in manner and form as pleaded; and a
demurrer ought, therefore, in a Court of Law, to bring before the
Court a question of mere law and in a Court of Equity a question of law .or equity merely. The demurrer, therefore, must be
taken to admit the whole case of fraud m ade by the bill, and the
argument to support it must be, not that a positive limitation of
time has barred the suit, for that would be a pure question of law,
but that, from long acquiescence, it should be presumed that the
fraud charged did not exist, or that it should be intended that the
plaintiff had confirmed the transaction. This must be an inference of fact, and not an inference of law, and the demurrer must
be overruled, because the defendant has no right to avail himself by deinurrer of an inference of fact, upon matter upon which
a jury in a. Court of Law would collect matter of fact to decide
their verdict, or a Court would proceed in the same manner i
equity. What limitation of time will bar a suit, where there is
no positive limitation, or under what circumstances the lapse of
time ought tc have that effect, must depend upon the facts of the
particular case, and the conclusion must be an inference of fact,
and not an inference of law, and therefore cannot be made on
demurrer. But where the defence is not a presumption, from
long acquiescence, but a positive limitation of time, which the
Court, by analogy'to the statute of limitation, adopts; it may
clearly be taken advantage of by demurrer."
In the case of H6venden v. Lord Annesly, 2 Schoale and Lefroy, 629, it was decided, that in cases of a positive limitation of
time as a bar to the remedy, a demurrer to the bill would be,
sustained. That case was decided by Lord Redesdale, in 1806.
In the edition of Lord Redesdale's Treatise upon Equity Pleading, by Jeremy, the edition of 1836, (revised by Redesdale himself,) page 212, the distinction taken in the above note and
opinion of Thurlow, is maintained.
Mr. Justice Story, in his very able Treatise upon Equity
Pleading, p. 378, states the doctrine with great clearness. "The
same principle," he says, "will apply to a bill which states a

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

263

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

case within the statute of limitations at law, and upon which
Courts of Equity follow the analogy of the law, for, under such
circumstances, Courts of Equity hold that the objection may be
taken as a defence by demurrer."
In one 9f the latest treatises upon Chancery Practice, by
Daniels, (published inl1838, London edition,.) pages 43 and 44,
all the decisions upon this subject are cited, and they snow con:clusively that a demurrer can be suttained in cases analogous to
the statute of limitations. But he says,
"It is to be remarked here, that all the above cases were
decided upon the ground of their coming within the statute of
limitations, or the rules of the Court which have been adopted
in analogy to the statute, and that therefore there was a positive
limitation of time upon which the Court could proceed. Where,
however, there is no such positive limitation, the question whether
the Court will interfere or not, depends upon whether, from the
facts of the case, the Court will infer acquiescence, or confirmation, or release. Such inference is an inference of fact and not
of law., and cannot be raiied on demurrer." He cites Cuthbert
v. Creasy, Mad. and Geld's Rep. 189, as a recent decision of the
English Chancery upon this very point.
Upon the mere technical law of pleading, therefore, we feel
gteat confidence that noadvantage of time can be taken in the
present case, by demurrer.
But, besides the mere technical objection, there are reasons
lying close to the merits of the case, which show conclusively
that extreme injustice would be done to Rhode Island, to allow.
the lapse of time to be taken advantage of under a demurrer;
We. have stated in our bill -that Massachusetts took possession
of the territory in dispute in 1719, and has continued in possession ever since. But we have also stated various matters iri
avoidance of thi- possession,
In page 43 of the pziiited case it is stated "that the said, province of Massachusetts, on or about the 14th of May, 1719,
wrongfully took possession 'of all that tract, "&c." "And has
sifice contined, wrongfully, to exercise jurisdiction ov'er the
same."
The bill then proceeds to state that the line*established by the
agreement of 1719, was never confirmed by Rhode Island,'

SUPREME COURT
[Rhode Island v.Massachusetts.]

"but that, on the contrary, the claim of said colony, uniformly
was, that the true dividing line on the north part of said colony,
was a: line drawn three English miles, and no more, south of the
south part of said Charles river, or of any or every part thereof,
as defined and granted by the letters patent aforesaid; and that
the claim of Massachusetts ta'any other or different line was
never acquiesced in, or consented to, by said colony of Rhode
Island; and that the said claim of the said colony was publicly
and frequently urged and maintained by said colony, and by the
freemen and inhabitants thereof."
Here are clear and distinct allegations of facts. The demurrer
admits the truth of them. It admits that Rhode Island never
acquiesced in the possession or claim of Massachusetts, but
always maintained her claim for the charter line as now contended for.
This demurrer admits the facts of non-acquiescence. It admits the truth of all evidence whic the plaintiff by any possibility can offer, under that general -allegation. The very question
as to time in this case is, has Rhode Island acquiesced in the
possession of Massachusetts? In her bill she says she has not;
and she has a right to offer ant and all evidence which tends to
prove that fact. But the demurrer excludes that evidence by
admitting the fact itself. It will not answer to admit the fact in
pleading, and deny it in the argument. It must be denied in
pleading, so that Rhode Island may offer her evidence, or it cannot be denied at all. Can it then be gravely contended by the
learned counsel of the very lofty and imposing state of Massachusetts, fhat agreements entered into under a clear and admitted mistake, caused by her own misrepresentations, can stahd
for one moment in any Court, in any civilized nation in the
world? Can it be contended, that any length of possession
under such agreements, admitted to have been wrongfully taken
in the first instance, wrongfully continued, and never acquiesced
in by Rhode Island, can confer upon Massachusetts any title ?
Our difficulty has been to find, in. the whole range of the case, a
spot of debatable ground.
Mr. Webster, in support of the derlurrer.
The bill of Rhode Island asks the Court to disturb a boundary

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

265

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.3

between that state and Massachusetts, which has been settled
for more than two hundred years. This is a question of great
magnitude; and the matter for the decision of the Court is,
whether a case has been made out in the bill on which Massachusetts may resist the claim thus presented.
The charter of Massachusetts originated in a grant
by the
council established at Plymouth, on the 19th of Iarch, 1628, to
Sir Henry Rosewell and others; by which the soil and" jurisdiction of the territory, now belonging to the commonwealth of
Massachusetts, was granted to a southern boundary, to run
three miles south of Charles river. In 1663, the province of
Rhode Island was graited by King Charles II., and the grant
was limited to, and by the southern boundary of the colony of
Massachusetts.
As to the exact location of this boundary, difficulties arose,
and commissioners were appointed by Rhode Island and Massachusetts; 'and in 1719 agreements were made by the commissioners of both parties.
What is the ground on which these agreements are to be set
aside? It is said to be that they were founded in mistake; and
that by them Massachusetts has "gained, and Rhode Island has
lost four miles of territory. This is the whole ground. No
fraud is charged, none is alleged. No assertion is made in. the
bill that advantage was taken by Massachusetts in the adjustment; or that the Commissioners of Rhode Island had not
knowledge of the spbject confided to them: and if they had
been ignorant, it would not avail. They had full right and full
opportunity to make all necessary examinations.
It is said that, under the mistake, the line was placed seven
miles from Charles river, instead of three miles. "Rhode Island
discovered the mistake in 1749, and that the proceedings set
forth in the bill, show that Rhode Island has not acquiesced in
the line then established; the object of this application to the
Court is to obtain relief from the mistake discovered in 1749.
The question is, whether this Court can interfere after so long
a period; whether time alone will not prevent the disturbance
of an adjustment of such long standing, and in reference to
which no adverse movement has been made for niearly one
hundred years; and as to which nothing has been done by Rhode

Island, other than expressions of dissatisfaction. If it were a
recent transaction, no adjudged cases are known to sustain the
application; and no principles of public law will sanction the
interference of the Court. If it'was an affair of yester4ay,- the
Court would not act upon it.
Several things were to be ascertained by the commissioiers.
The course of Charles river and its branches, and then a line
running three miles south of the river. This was the established
charter boundary of Massachusetts, to which the northern line
of Rhode Island was limited by her charter, granted many years
after that of Massachusetts.' After all the investigation the commissioners thought necessary, they adopted the Woodward and
Saffrey station, as the point which was to determine the boundary line; a point which had been fixed twenty years before the
existence of Rhode Island. No misrepresentations are charged
to the commissioners of Massachusetts; no interference with the
inquiries which the Rhode Island commissioners milit be
desirous of making; and the determination of tlhe question was
made after every opportunity for examination. If a mistake
was made, which is not admitted, can relief from it be now obtained, where no fraud is imputed.
The cases in the books sustain the views of the counsel for the
state of Massachusetts. If better knowledge exist in one party
to an agreement than in the other ,the agreement will not bedisturbed. 9 Ves. 273. If parties are dealing, and both have equal
opportunities of knowledge, the Court will not interfere. In this

If men have'agreed to a boundary between them, and it may
be afterwards di§arbed on the' ground of mistake, the conse"quences would be disastrous, and fatal to the tranquil ownership
of estates. Boundaries must be settled for the assurance of cultivation. The husbandman would refuse to improve his land,
unless-he wa' ai rest on the subject of the lines and corners of his
property. If these pyinciples regulate the concerns of individuals,
how much more necessary are they in the relations between
coterminous states. " This is supported by the writers on internationallaw. Vattell says, the agreements between natiotws, however mistaken, are 'to stand. If this is not, so, how shall such

disputes be at any time adjusted.

The books, and all history,

are full of these principles.
Mr. Webster referred to the controversy between William
Penn and Lord Baltimore, in support of these irinciples; the
settlement of the disputes as to boundaries between the states of
'Kentucky and Tennessee; and to other caes. 'Will any one say
these adjustments, and the line' established under, them, can
now be disturbed on the ground of mistake? It is said the
bill of Rhode Island charges the mistake, and the demurrer
admits it; and, therefore, the whole case of the complainants is
admitted. The question to be decided by the, Court is not
-whether the mistake is admitted, but what is the effect of the
mistake. The mistake is immaterial, and this is submitted to
the Court. If de mistake could not entitle the complainant to
relief, its admission would not do so.
If there had been a fraud; if the commissioners of Rhode
Island had been deceived, there is no grolmd for relief. It is
too late, at this distant period, to inquire into such a transaction.
This brings-the Court to the inquiry, what is the effect of lapse
of time? But it is said the demurrer will niot permit the Iarty to
avail himself of lapse of time. In order* to do thip, an answer
must be put in. But the lapse of time is on the face of the complainant's bills; and when this is so, it will avail, the party. deI
murring.
This is a question of pleading. The Couit has adopted the
rules and principles of the Court of Chancery in. England; and
they will r6gard the decisions of the English Courts of Chancery
on this question. It has been s~ttled in these Courts for half a
century. The case of Foster v. Hodgson, 19 Ves. 180-i84,
determines this point: cited also, 1 Vesey and Beame, 535, 536.

Equity Pleading, 378. 389.
The defendant, the state of' Masiachusetts, is right, therefore,
in the form of pleading; and lapse of time, possession, and acquiescence, are a complete bat against fraud. The bill. states
that the mistakowas discovered in '1749, 'and no proceedings
took place in this Court until 1835--eighty-six years afterwards!
There are' two modes in which lapse of time may be takeft
advantage o in Courts of gquity. The first, where the law

expressly applies to the case. A Court of Equity then adopts
the same rule. 2 Jacobs' and Walker, 191. 2 Story's Equity
Jurisprudence, 735. Second, wherever there has been laches,
the statute of limitations iVill be applied by Courts of Chancery.
Story, 735, 736. In this case, both rules apply. There has been
most abundant laches. Why did not Rhode Island apply to the
Privy Council-to the Continental Congress-to this Court, established in 1789 ? This is acquiescence; no matter what the complainants say, it is acquiescence. Such a course of acquiescence
cures fraud, if any.fraud had existed. 2 Story's Equity, 739,
note; cited also, Story's Equity Pleadings, 379. 9 Peters, 405.
Bourn v. Chiles, 10 Peters, 177. 1 Story's Equity, 139. 189.
502. 2 Sch. and Lef. 636. The complainants assert that lapse
of time is only evidence against their title, but the demurrer of
the defendant takes-away the operation of the evidence. This
cannot be, or there would be no demurrer for lapse of time on
the face of the bill. But Courts of Equity adopt a higher principle. They will not assist a plaintiff to maintain a stale claim.
They will save a party from the trouble of resisting such demands. It is manifest, then, that if there was mistake; if there
was fraud; no relief willbe granted after such a lapse of time.
There is another and an important point for the consideration
of the Court in this case.
The Constitution gives the Supreme Court a right to decide
controversies between the states of the Union. This is a case
in which two states having agreed to an actual and defined
boundary, nearly one hundred years ago, come before the Court,
and the Court is asked to disturb this boundary established before the states came into the confederacy--to change the limits
'of the territory each possessed when she entered into it-can
this Court interfere in such a matter? Each of the states, took
her position ifi
the Union holding the territory now held, with the
actual boundaries to their territories well known and long established. Independence was declared by the states with these
limits. The treaty of peace in 1783 acknowledged the states as
they then existed. No disturbance can be made of the territories of each state after this mutual recognition, and after this acknowledgment by the nation, to which, before the Declaration of
Independence and the treaty of peace, thei were subject. No

tribunal which has its existence under a constitution of government formed after these relations existed, has power to interfere
between them in such a question.
Mr. Chief Justice TA.EY delivered the opinion of the Court.
The attention of the Court has on several occasions been
drawn to this case by the important questions which have arisen
in different stages of the proceedings. At the last term, it came
before us upon a plea in bar to the complainant's bill, which upon
the motion of the complainant had been set down for argument.
This part of the case is reported in 14 Peters, 210, where the

allegations contained in the bill are so fully set out that it is
unnecessary to repeat them here. The Court having overruled
the plea for the reasons stated in the report of the case, the defendant has since demurred; and in this state of ihe pleadings
the question is directly presented, whether the case stated by
Rhode Island in her bill, admitting it to be true as there stated,
entitles her to relief.
The character of the case, and of the parties, has made it the
duty of the Court to examine very carefully the different- questions which from time to time have arisefi in these proceedings.
And if those which are brought up by the demurrer were new
to the Court, or if the judgment now to be pronounced would
seriously influence the ultimate decision; we should deem it proper to hold the subject under advisement until the next term, for
the purpose of giving to it a more deliberate examination..
But although the questions now before the Court did not arise
upon the plea, and of course were not then decided, yet much of
the argument on that occasion turned upon principles which are
involved in the case as it now stands. The facts stated in the
bill were brought before us, and the grounds upon which the
complainant claimed relief were necessarily discussed in the argument at the,bar, and the attention of the Court strongly drawn
to the subject. The whole case as presented by the bill and
demurrer has been again fully and ably argued, at the present
term; and as the Court has made up its opinion, and are satisfied
that the delay of our judgment to the next term would not enable us to obtaih more or better light upon the subJect, it would
be useless to postpone the decision.
z2

270

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Massachusets]

The demurrer admits the truth of the facts alleged in the
bill, and it is sufficient for the purposes of this opinion to -state in
a few words the naterial allegations contained in it.
1st. It alleges that the true boundary line between Massachusetts 'and Rhode Island, by .virtue of their charters from the
English crown, is a line run east and west three miles south of
Charles river, or any or every part thereof; and sets out the
charters which support, in this respect, the averments in the bill.
2d. That Massachusetts holds possession to a line seven miles
south of Charles river, which does not run east aid west, but
runs south of a west course; and that the territory between this
line and the true one above mentioned, belongs to Rhode Island,
and, that the defendant unjustly withholds it from her.
3d. That Massachusetts obtained possession of this territory
under certain agreerfients, and proceedings of commissioners
appointed by the two colonies, which are set out at large in the
bill; and the complainant avers that the commissioners on the
part of Rhode Island, agreed to this line under the mistaken belief that it was only three miles south of Charles river; and that
they were led into this mistake by the representations made to
them by the commissioners on the part of Massachusetts, upon
whose statement they relied.
4th. That this agreement of the commissioners was never
ratified by either of the colonies: and the bill sets out the various
proceedings of the commissioners and legislatures of the two
colonies, which if not sufficient to establish the correctness of
the averment, are yet not incompatible with it.
5th. The bill further states that the mistake was not discovered by Rhode Island until 1740, when she soon afterwards. took
measures to correct it; that she never acquiesced in the possession of Massachusetts, after the mistake was discovered, but has
ever since continually resisted it; and never admitted- any line
as the true boundary betweeri them, but the one called for by
the charters. Various proceedings are set out, and facts stated
in the bill, to show that the complainant never acquiesced; and to
account for the delay in prosecuting her claim. Whether they
are sufficient or nor for that purpose, is not now in question.
They are certainly consistent with the averment, and tend to
support it.

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

27-1

[Rhode Island v. Ma.sachusetts.]

The case then, as made by the bill, and to be now taken as
true, is substantially this; The charter boundary between these
colonies was three miles south of Charles river; and the parties
intending to mark a line in that place, marked it by mistake,
four miles further south, encroaching so much on the territory
of Rhode Island; and the complainant was led into this mistake
by confiding in the representations of the commissioners of the
defendant. And as soon as the error was discovered, she made
claim to the true line, and has ever since contended for it.
We speak of the case as it appears upon the pleadings. It
may prove to be a very different one, hereafter, when the evidence on both sides is produced. But taking it as it now stands,
if it were a disptite between two individuals, in relation to one
of the ordinary subjects of private contract; and there had been
no laches to deprive the party of his title to relief; would-a Court
of Equity compel him to abide by a contract entered into under
such circumstances ? It is one of the most familiar duties of the
Chancery Court to relieve against mistake, especially when it
has been produced by the representations of the adverse party.
In this case, the fact mistaken, was the very foundation -of the
agreement. There was no intention on either side to transfer
territory, nor any consideration given by the one to the other to
obtain it. Nor was there any dispute ahising out of conflicting
grants of the crown, or upon the construction of -their charters,
which they proposed to settle by compromise. Each party
agreed that the boundary was three miles south of Charles river;
and the only object was to ascertain and mark that point: and
upon the case, as it comes before us, tihe complainant avers, and
the defendant admits that the place marked, was seven miles
south of the river, instead of three, and was fixed on 'by mistake;
and that the commissioners of Rhode Island were led into the
error, by confiding in the representations of the Massachusetts
commissioners. Now, if this mistake had been discovered a few
days after the agreements were made, and Rhode Island had immediately gone before a tribunal, having competent jurisdicion,
upon principles of equity, to relieve against a mistake committed
by such parties, can there be any doubt that the agreement.
would have been set aside; and Rhode Island restored to the
true chartgr line? We think not. Agreements thus obtained,

272

SUPREME COURT.
[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

cannot deprive the complainant of territory, which belonged to
her before; unless she has forfeited her title to relief, by acquiescence or unreasonable delay.
But it.has been argued, on the part of the defendant, that assuming the agreement td have been made by mistake, and that
the complainant would have been entitled to set it aside, if she
had prosecuted her claim within a reasonable time; yet, as Massachusetts entered nito the disputed territory immediately after
the agreement, an. has held it ever since, the compl.dinant is too
late in seeking relief: that after such a lapse of time, she is
barred by prescription, or must be presumed to have acquiesced
in the boundary agreed upon; and that if she did not acquiesce,
she has been guilty of such laches and negligence in prosecuting her claim, that she is no longer entitled to the countenance
of a Court of Chancery.
The answer to this argument is a very plain one. The complainant avers that she never acquiesced in the boundafy claimed
by the defendant, but has continually resisted it since she discovered the mistake; and that she has been prevented from
prosecuting her claim at an earlier day, by the circumstances
mentioned in her bill. These averments and allegations, in the
present state of the pleadings, must be taken as true; and it is
not necessary to decide now, whether they are sufficient to excuse the delay. But when it is admitted by the demurrer that
she never acquiesced, and has from time to time made efforts
to regain the territory by negotiations with Massachusetts, and
was prevented by the circumstances she mentions from appealing to the proper tribunal to grant her redress; we cannot undertake to say, that the possession of Massachusetts has been such
as to give her a title by prescription: or that the laches and
negligence of Rhode Island have been such as to forfeit her right
to the interposition of a Court of Equity.
In cases between individuals, where the statute of limitations
would be a bar ht law, the same rule is undoubtedly applied in
a Court of Equity. And when the fact appears on the face of the
bill, and no circumstances are stated, which take the case out of,
the operation of the act; the defendant may undoubtedly take
advantage of it by demurrer, and is not bound to plead or
answer. The time necessary to operate as a bar in equity, is

JANUARY TERM, 1841.

273

[Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

fixed at twenty years, by analdgy to the statute of limitations;
and the rule is stated in Story's Corn. on Eq. Pl. 389, and is supported and illustrated by many authorities cited in the notes. It
was recognised in this Court in the case of Elmendorf v. Taylor,
i0 Wheat. 168-175. But it would be impossible with any
semblance of justice to adopt such a rule of limitation in the
case before us. For here two political communities are concerned, who cannot act with the same promptness as individuals;
and the boundary in question was in a wild unsettled country,
and the error not likely to be discovered, until the lands were
granted by the respective colonies, and the settlements'approached the disputed line: and the only tribunal that could relieve
after the mistake was discovered, was on the other side of the
Atlantic, and was not bound to hear the case*and proceed to
judgment, except when it suited its own convenience. The same
reasons that prevent the bar of limitations, make it equally
evident, that a possession so obtained, and held by Massichusetts, under such circumstances, cannot give a title by prescription.
The demurrer, therefore, must be overruled.
But the question upon the agreements, as well as that upon the
lapse of time, may assume a very different aspect, if the defendant answers and denies the mistake; and relies upon the lapse
of time as evidence of acquiescence, or of such negligence and
laches-as will deprive the party of his right to the aid of a Court
of Equity. It will then be open to him to show that there was
no mistake; that the line agreed on is the true charter line; or
that such must be presumed to have been the construction given
to the charters by the commissioners of both colonies; or that
the agreement was the compromise of a disputed boundary,
upon which each party must be supposed to have had equal
means of knowledge.
So, too, in relation to the facts stated in the bill to account for
the delay. It will be in the power of the complainant to show,
if she can, that her long continued ignorance of an error, (which,
if it b6 one, was palpable and open,) was occasioned by the wild
and unsettled state of the country; and that the subsequent delay
was produced by circumstances sufficiently cogent to justify it
upon principles of justice and equity; or was assented to by

SUPREME COURT.
[(Rhode Island v. Massachusetts.]

Massachusetts, or occasioned by her conduct. And, on the other
hand, it will be the right of the defendant to show, if she can,
that Rhode Island would not have been ignorant of the true
position ef this line until 1740; or, if she remained in ignorance
until that time, that it must have arisen from such negligence
and inattention to her rights, as would render it inexcusable; and
should be treated, therefore, as if it had been acqui,.scence with"
knowledge: or she may show that, after the mistake is admitted
to have been discovered, Rhode Island was guilty of laches, in
not prosecuting her rights in the proper forum, and that the
excuses offered for the delay are altogether unfounded or insufficient; and that Massachusetts never assented to it, nor occasioned it.
We state these questions as points that will remain open upon
the final hearing, for the purpose of showing that the real merits
of the controversy could not have been finally disposed of, upon
the present pleadings; but without meaning to say that other
questions may not be made by the parties,.if they shall suppose
them to arise upon the proceedings hereafter to be had. The
points above suggested, which are excluded by the case as it
now stands, make it evident that this controversy ought -to be
more fully before the Court, upon the answer, and the proofs to
be offered on both sides, before it is finally disposed of.
The Court will, therefore; order and decree that the demurrer
be overruled; and that the defendant answer the *complainant's
bill on or before the first day of August nfext.
This 6ause came on to be heard on the amended bill and demurrer, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof,
it is now here ordered by this Court, that the said demurrer be,
and the same is hereby, overruled; and it is also now further
here ordered by this Co'urt that the defendant answer the bill of
complaint as amended, on or before the first day of August next.
