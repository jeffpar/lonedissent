ALBANY BRIDGE CAsE.
Statement of the case.

also we are inclined to hold that the objection-of the appellants must be overruled. Having come to that conclusion,
it is unnecessary to examine the third answer presented by
the United States to this objection.
III. Remaining objection of the appellants to the jurisdiction is, that the wrongful acts, if any, were committed out of
the district where the libel was filed. But there is no merit
in the objection, as the rule is well settled, that libels in rem
may be prosecuted in any district where the property is
found. Such was the rule laid down by this court in the
case of The -PropellerCommerce;* and it is clear, beyond controversy, that the present case is governed by the rule there
laid down.
The decree of the Circuit Court is therefore
AFFIRMED.

Court dismissed the bill. On appeal here the whole matteras well the general question of the constitutional right of
a State to pass a law authorizing the erection of bridges
over navigable rivers of the United States, as the more special question, whether the navigation of the Hudson would
be practically obstructed by this bridge, as it was proposed
to erect the same-was fully and most ably argued by Mr.
Secretary of State Seward, and the Honorable Mr. 3". . L.
Pruyn, 31 C., in favor of the right to build, and by Messrs. Carlisle and Senator 1Reverdy Johnson, contra. But the court being
equally divided, no opinion on any point was given, and the
decree so stood a
