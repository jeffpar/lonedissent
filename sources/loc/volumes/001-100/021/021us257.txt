given according to law for the regulation of their

conduct, and satisfy all damages and injuries which
shall be done or committed contrary to the tenor
tnereof, by such vessel, during her commission,
and deliver up the same when revoked by the President of the United States." The defendants
pleaded a performance of this condition; to which
the District Attorney replied, that on the 15th day
of December, 1813, at a place called St. Johnb,
the same being a colony and dependency of Great
Britain, certain goods, &c. the same being of
the growth, produce, and manufacture of Great

and for a long time afterwards, and at the time of
bringing the same into the said District of Maine,
was, by law, prohibited, were put on board a certain vessel or schooner called the George, with
the intention to import the same into the said
States, contrary to the true intent and meaning of
the statute in such case made and provided, and
with the knowledge of the master of the said
schooner George; and, afterwards, in pursuance
of said intention, the said schooner did depart
from the said place of lading, to wit, St. Johns,
and there, afterwards, on the high seas, by way of
collusion, and with intent to evade the statute
aforesaid, and under colour of capture by the private armed vessel called the Fly, aforesaid, to
import the said goods, &c. into the said States,

laden as aforesaid, was taken, possession of by the
said Dekoven, by and with the said private armed
vessel called the Fly, whereof the said Dekoven
then and there was master as aforesaid, on the
high seas, and, afterwards, on the 24th day of January, 1814, the said schooner George, and the
goods, &c. aforesaid, were brought into the
port of iEllsworth, in the said District of Maine,
and the goods, -&c. were then and there, under
tolour of capture, by said Dekoven, his officers
-and crew, in and with said schooner Fly, imported, in manner aforesaid, into the said States, contrary to the true intent and meaning of the statute
aforesaid. Other pleadings followed, (which .it
is not necessary to state,) ending with a demurrer,
upon which the District Court was of opinion,
that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment. The
defendants, thereuldn, moved for a hearing in
Chancery upon the making up of the judgment
on the bond declared on, which motion was denied,
and judgment rendered for the United States.
The cause was then brought by writ of error to
the Circuit Court, the Judges of which were divided
in opinion upon the following questions, which
were, thereupon, certified to this Court.
1. Whether an American private armed vessel,
duly commissioned, making collusive captures of
enemy's property during the late war with Great
Britain, and under colour of such capture, introducing goods and merchandise into the United
States, contrary to the provisions of the act of
March 1, 1809, c. 195. revived and continued in

[PRIZE.]

The EXPERISIENT.
In cases of collusive capture, papers found on board one captured
vessel may be invoked into the case'of another captured on the
same cruise.
A commission obtained by fraudulent 'k1pres6etation,
will not
vest the interests of prize.
But a collusive capture made undd- a cbrUdHisl~is not, per 8e,evidence that the" commission was frudqeutly obtained.
A collusive capture vests no title in the captors, not because the commission is thereby made void, but because the captors' thereby forfeit all title to the prize property.
