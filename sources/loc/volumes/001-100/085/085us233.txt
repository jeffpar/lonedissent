RAILWAY COMPANY V. NLLERTON.
Statement of the case.

RAILWAY COMPANY V. ALLERrON.
'Where the charter of a corporation says that the capital stock of the corporation shall be a sum named, as ex. gr., $100,000, "and may be increased
from time to time at the pleasure of the said corporation," the directors

alone, and without the matter being submitted to and approved by the
stockholders, have no power to increase it unless expressly authorized
thereto; and the fact that the charter declares that "al

l

the corporate

powers of the said corporation shall be vested in and exercised by a
board of directors and such officers and agents as said board shall appoint" does not alter the case. The powers thus granted to the directors, &c., refer to the ordinary business transactions of the corporation.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the Northern District
of Illinois; the case being thus:
The Chicago City Railway Company was a corporation
,owning a street railroad in Chicago. The directors of the
'company, without consulting the stockholders or calling a
meeting of them, resolved to increase the capital stock of
the company from $1,250,000 to $1,500,000. To this one
Allerton, who was a stockholder, objected, and filed a bill
praying for an injunction to prevent the increase. His position was that it could not be lawfully made without the
,concurrence of the stockholders, and in support of this view
he relied upon the constitution of Illinois, adopted in July,
1870, by the thirteenth section of the eleventh article of
'which it is declared as follows:

"No railroad corporation shall issue any stock or bonds, ex.cept for money, labor, or property actually received and applied
to the purposes for which such corporation was created, and all
-stock-dividends, and other fictitious increase of the capital stock,
-or indebtedness of any such corporation, shall be void. The
capital stock of no railroad corporation shall be increased for
-any purpose, except upon giving sixty days' public notice in
-such manner as may be provided by law."
He also relied on an act of the legislature of Illinois,
passed March 26th, 1872, to execute and carry out the above
provision of the constitution, by which, amongst other

things, it was enacted that no corporation should change its.
name or place of business, increase or decrease its capital
stock, or the number of its directors, or consolidate with,
other corporations, without a vote of two-thirds of the stock
at a stockholders' meeting.
The railway company, in its answer, relied upon its charter, granted February 14th, 1859, the third and fourth sections of which were as follows:
"SECTION 3. The capital stock of said corporation sh ,l be
one hundred thousand dollars, and may be increased from time
to time, at the pleasure of said corporation.
"SECTION 4. All the corporate powers of said corporation shall
be vested in and exercised by a board of directors, and such,
officers and agents as said board shall appoint."

The position of the company was that the third section
conferred an unrestricted right to increase the capital stockat will, and that the fourth vested this power in the board,
of directors, and that the constitutional provision and act
above referred to, if applied to this corporation, would impair the validity of the contract. It was further set up,
however, that the said provision did not apply to railways,
worked by horse-power. The court below decreed in favor
of the complainant and the company took the present ap.
peal.

Mr. Justice BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.,
Without attempting to decide the constitutional question,
or to give a construction to the act of the legislature, we;
are satisfied that the decree must be affirmed on the broad
ground that a change so organic and fundamental as that'
of increasing the capital stock of a corporation beyond the
limit fixed by the charter cannot be made by the directors
alone, unless expressly authorized thereto. :The general,
power to perform all corporate acts refers to the ordinary,

business transactions of the corporation, and does not extend to a reconstruction of the body itself, or to an enlargement of its capital stock. A corporation, like a partnership,
is an association of natural persons who contribute a joint
capital for a common purpose, and although the shares may
be assigned to new individuals in perpetual succession, yet
the number of shares and amount of capital cannot be increased, except in the manner expressly authorized by the
charter or articles of association.
Authority to increase the capital stock of a corporation
may undoubtedly be conferred by a law passed subsequent
to the charter; but such a law should regularly be accepted
by the stockholders. Such assent might be inferred by subsequent acquiescence; but in some form or other it must be
given to render the increase valid and binding on them.
Changes in the purpose and object of an association, or in
the extent of its constituency or membership, involving the
amount of its capital stock, are necessarily fundamental in
their character, and cannot, on general principles, be made
without the express or implied consent of the members.
The reason is obvious.
First, as it respects the purpose and object. This may be
said to be the final cause of the association, for the sake of
which it was brought into existence. To change this without the consent of the associates, would be to commit them
to an enterprise which they never embraced, and would be
manifestly unjust.
Secondly, as it respects the constituency, or capital and
membership. This is the next most important and fundamental point in the constitution of a body corporate. To
change it without the consent of the stockholders, would be
to make them members of an association in which they
never consented to become such. It would change the rela.
tive influence, control, and profit of each member. If the
directors alone could do it, they could always perpetuate
their own power. Their agency does not extend to such an
act unless so expressed in the charter, or subsequent enabling
act; and such subsequent act, as before said, would not bind

the stockholders without their acceptance of it, or assent to
it in some form. Even when the additional stock is distributed to each stockholder pro rata, it would often work
injustice, because many of the stockholders might be unable
to take their respective shares, and might thus lose their
relative interest and influence in the corporate concerns.
These conclusions flow naturally from the character of
such associations. Of course, the associates themselves may
adopt or assent to a different rule. If the charter provides
that the capital stock may be increased, or that a new business may be adopted by the corporation, this is undoubtedly
an authority for the corporation (that is, the stockholders) to
make such a change by a stockholders' vote, in the regular
way. Perhaps a subsequent ratification or assent to a change
already made, would be equally effective. It is unnecessary
to decide that point at this time. But if it is desired to confer such a power on the directors, so as to make their acts
binding and final, it should be expressly conferred.
Where the stock expressly allowed by a charter has not
been all subscribed, the power of the directors to receive
subscriptions for the balance may stand on a different footing. Such an act might, perhaps, be considered as merely
getting in the capital already provided for the operations
and necessities of the company, and, therefore, as belonging
to the orderly and proper administration of the company's
affairs. Even in such case, however, prudent and fair directors would prefer to have the sanction of the stockholders
to their acts. But that is not the present case, and need
not be further considered.
DECREE AFFIRMED.
