[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

BEAN V. BECKWITH ET AL.
I. Whenever one justifies an act which in itself constitutes at common law
a wrong, upon the process, order, or authority of another, he must set
forth substantially and in a traversable form the process, order, or authority relied upon, and no mere averment of its legal effect, without
other statement, will answer. Accordingly, where certain military
officers of the United States, being sued for the arrest and imprisonment
of a person in Vermont, not connected with the military service of the
United States, alleged in their pleas that the arrest and imprisonment
were made tinder the authority and by the order of the President,
whose orders as commander in chief of the armies of the United States,
by the rules and regulations of the army, they were bound to obey,
without setting forth any order, general or special, of the President directing or approving of the acts in question, it was held that the pleas
were defective and insufficient.
2. The act of March 3d, 1863, entitled "An act relating to habeas corpus,
and regulating judicial proceedings in certain cases," and the act of
March 2d, 1867, entitled ",An act to declare valid and conclusive certain
proclamations of the President, and acts done in pursuance thereof, or
of his orders in the suppression of the late rebellion against the United
States," do not change the rules of pleading, when the defence is set up
in a special plea, or dispense with the exhibition of the order or authority upon which a party relies. Nor do they cover all acts done by officers in the military service of the United States simply because they are
acting under the general authority of the President as commander in
chief of the armies of the United States. Assuming that they are not
liable to any constitutional objection, they only cover acts done under
orders or proclamations issued by the President, or by his authority.
ON certificate of division of opinion between the judges
of the Circuit Court for the District of Vermont; the case
being thus:
An act of March 3d, 1863,* entitled "An act relating to
habeas corpus, and regulating judicial proceedings in certain

cases," enacts that "any order of the President or under his
authority," shall be a defence to any actions, &c., for any
search, seizure, or arrest, &c., made, &c., under and by virtue

of such order, or under color of any law of Congress.

Statement of the case.

"'An act to declare valid and conclusive certain proclamations of the President, and acts done in pursuance thereof;
or of his orders, in the suppression of the late rebellion
against the United States," enacts:
"All acts, proclamations, and orders of the President of the

commissions, or the arrest, imprisonment, and trial of persons
charged with participation in the late rebellion against the
United States, or as aiders or abettors thereof, or as guilty of
any disloyal practice in aid thereof, or of any violation of the

and acts done or had by courts martial or military commissions,
or arrests and imprisonments made in the premises by any person, by the authority of the orders or proclamations of the President, made as aforesaid, or in aid thereof, are hereby approved
in all respects, legalized, and made valid, to the same extent and
with the same effect as if said orders and proclamations had
been issued and made, and said arrests, imprisonments, proceedings, and acts had been done under the previous express authority and direction of the Congress of the United States, and in
pursuance of a law thereof, previously enacted and expressly
authorizing and directing the same to be done. And no civil
court of the United States, or of any State, or of the District

shall have or take jurisdiction of, or in any manner reverse, any
-of the proceedings had or acts done as aforesaid, nor shall any

,or omitted to be done in pursuance or in aid of any of said
proclamations or orders, or by authority or with the approval
of the President within the period aforesaid, and respecting any
.of the matters aforesaid, and all officers and other persons in
the service of the United States, or who acted in aid thereof,
:acting in the premises shall be held primd facie to have been

Statement of the case.

August, 1865, Andrew Bean sued Daniel Beckwith and Gilman Henry, in trespass, for an alleged assault and battery
upon him, and false imprisonment. The declaration averredl
that the defendants, in November, 1864, at Newbury, in the
county of Orange, in the State of Vermont, assaulted and,
seized the plaintiff and carried him against his will to Windsor, in that State, and forced him into the State prison it
that place, and confined him in a cell constructed for thieves.
and burglars and other convicts, for the space of seven.
months; and that by these means his health was destroyed,.
and he himself subjected to great distress and anguish of
mind, and injured in his business, fbr which destruction of
his health, distress, injuries, &c., he claimed damages from,
the defendants.
The defendants pleaded two pleas precisely alike with theexception of the form of their commencement. One of
them averred that the plaintiff ought not to have and maintain his action by reason of the matters stated; the other
averred that the cause by reason of these matters ought to,
be dismissed. The difference was of no consequence upon
the questions presented for the consideration of the court.
Both pleas set up that at the time of the commission of
the alleged grievances, and long previously, a rebellion existed against the laws and government of the United States,.
and that the public safety was greatly imperilled; that it
became necessary to raise troops to suppress the rebellion
and insure the public safety, and for that purpose troops wereraised in the Northern States, and especially in the military
district embracing the Second Congressional District of Vermont; that the defendant Henry was at the time a military
officer of the United States, namely, a provost marshal within
and for that district, and the defendant Beckwith was an
assistant provost marshal within the same district; that in
November, 1864, at Newbury, in the county of Orange, in
the State of Vermont, the plaintiff was charged with having
been guilty of disloyal practices in aid of the rebellion, andi
of affording aid and comfort to the rebels, to wit, with enticing soldiers, in June previous, to desert from the army of

the United States; that the defendants thereupon arrested
the plaintiff "on the charges aforesaid," and delivered him
to the keeper of the State prison for safe custody, until he
could be brought before the civil tribunals of the United
States upon those charges; that the plaintiff was there detained until May 1st, 1865, when he was brought before the
United States commissioner and held to bail for his appearance before the Circuit Court on the fourth Tuesday of July
following, to answer those charges; and that from his arrest
until this last date, there was no session of the Circuit Court,
nor any grand jury in attendance upon any court of the
United States within the district.
The pleas also averred that in making the arrest, impris.
onment, and detention, the defendant Henry acted in his
military capacity of provost marshal, and the defendant
Beckwith acted as his aid; that the arrest, imprisonment,
and detention were made without unnecessary force and
violence, "under the authority and by the order of the President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, since deceased,
whose orders as commander in chief of the armies of the
United States, by the rules and regulations of the army, the
defendants were bound to obey;" and that the arrest, imprisonment, and grievances in the declaration mentioned,
were the same arrest, imprisonment, and detention thus set
forth; concluding with an absque hoe as to the violence and
other circumstances of aggravation and cruelty with which
the original imprisonment and subsequent confinement are
charged to have been accompanied.
To these pleas the defendants demurred generally, and
the judges being divided in opinion as to their sufficiency,
the question on certificate of division was, whether either
was sufficient.
Mr. E. J. Phelps, for the plaintiff, argued:
1st. That the averments in the pleas did not bring the
case within the terms of the statutes in question, or either
of them.
2d. That if those statutes were to receive such a construe.

tion as would comprehend this case, then they were in con.
travention of the Constitution of the United States, and
especially of articles four, five, and six of its amendments.
3d. That in any event both pleas were bad, as being
pleaded to and assuming to answer the whole declaration,
while the provisions of the statutes, even if applicable and
constitutional, would afford a defence to only a part of it.
Mr. S. F. Phillips, Solicitor-General, contra:
1st. The facts set up amount to justification, and we rely
on them as a justification under the first plea. They show
that the plaintiff was guilty of a felony. All private persons had a right to arrest him, and the defendants did not
lose their right by being military officers.
2d. The defendants are entitled to the benefit of the indemnity given by the act of 1867, and this they claim under
the second plea.
The act is constitutional. As it concerns itself only in
indemnifying United States officers against liabilities incurred in the colorable discharge of their duties as such, no
objection can be made to it as being outside of the enumerated powers of the General government.
Mr. Justice FIELD, having stated the case, delivered the
opinion of the court, as follows:
There is no averment in the pleas that at the time the
plaintiff was arrested any rebellion existed in the State of
Vermont, against the laws or government of the United
States; or that any military operations were being carried
on within its limits; or that the courts of justice were not
open there, and in the full and undisturbed exercise of their
regular jurisdiction ; or that the plaintiff was in the military
service of the United States, or in any way connected with
that service.
Nor is there any averment in the pleas as to the manner
in which, or the parties by whom the charges of disloyal
practices were made. It is not alleged that they were stated
in writing or supported by oath.

BEAN

v.

BEOKWITI.

Opinion of the court.

Nor do the pleas, whilst asserting that the acts, which are
the subject of complaint, were done under the authority and
by the order of the President, set forth any order, general
or special, of the President directing or approving of the
acts in question.
For this last omission all the judges are agreed, without
expressing any opinion upon the other omissions, that the
pleas are defective and insufficient. It is an old rule of
pleading, which, in the modern progress of simplifying
pleadings, has not lost its virtue, that whenever one justifies
in a special plea an act which in itself constitutes at common
law a wrong, upon the process, order, or authority of another, he must set forth substantially and in a traversable
form the process, order, or authority relied upon, and that
no mere averment of its legal effect, without other statement, will answer. In other words, if a defendant has cause
of justification for an alleged trespass, and undertakes to
plead it, he must set it forth in its essential particulars, so
that the plaintiff may be apprised of its nature and take issue
upon it if he desires, and so that the court may be able to
judge of its sufficiency.
The defendants intended by their pleas to rest the justification of their conduct upon the provisions of the act of
March 3d, 1863, entitled "An act relating to Habeas Corpus,
and regulating judicial proceedings in certain cases," and
of the act of March 2d, 1867, entitled "An act to declare
valid and conclusive certain proclamations of the President,
and acts done in pursuance thereof, or of his orders, in the
suppression of the late rebellion against the United States."t
These statutes were enacted, among other things, to protect parties from liability to prosecution for acts done in the
arrest and imprisonment of persons during the existence of
the rebellion, under orders or proclamations of the President, or by his authority or approval, who were charged
with participation in the rebellion, or as aiders or abettors,
or as being guilty of disloyal practices in aid thereof, or any

violation of the usages or the laws of war. Assuming for
this case that these statutes are not liable to any constitutional objection, they do not change the rules of pleading,
when the defence is set up in a special plea, or dispense with
the exhibition of the order or authority upon which a party
relies. Nor do they cover all acts done by officers in the
military service of the United States simply because they
are acting under the general authority of the President as
commander in chief of the armies of the United States.
They only cover acts done under orders or proclamations
issued by him, or under his authority; and there is no difficulty in the defendants setting forth such orders or proclamations, whether general or special, if any were made,
which applied to their case.
The views thus expressed render it unnecessary to consider any other objections taken by the plaintiff to the pleas
before us.
The questions certified must be ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE, and the cause
REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.

CHAFFEE & CO. V. UNITED STATES.

i. The action of debt lies for a statutory penalty, because the sum demanded
is certain, but though in form ex contractu it is founded in fact upon a
tort. The necessity of establishing a joint liability in such cases does
not exist; it is sufficient if the liability of any of the defendants be
shown. Judgment may be entered against them and in favor of the
others, whose complicity in the offence for which the penalty is prescribed is not proved, as though the action were in form as well as in
substance ex delicto.

2. The general rule which governs the admissibility of entries in books
made by private parties in the ordinary course of their business, requires that the entries shall be contemporaneous with the facts to which
they relate, and shall be made by parties having personal knowledge of
the facts, and be corroborated by their testimony, if living and accessible, or by proof of their handwriting if dead, or insane, or beyond the
reach of the process or commission of the court.
