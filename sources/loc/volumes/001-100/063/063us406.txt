THE UNITED

STATES, APPELLANATS, V.

AwDREs Pico.

Where the preliminary proceedings to a grant of land in California were not produced, and the grant and certificate of approval came from, the hands of the
claimants, no record of them being found among the Mexican archives or in
any book, nor is there any evidence of possession or occupation deserving
notice or consideration, the case will be remanded to the court below for

further evidence.

TmIs was an appeal from the District Court of the United
States for the northern district of California.
The state of Pico's title is mentioned in the opinion of the
court, and need not be repeated.
The case was argued by the Attorney General and MLIr.
Stnton for the United States, and by Mfr. Gilt for the appellee. It was very similar to the preceding case of Teschmaker.
The Attorney General's statement of the evidence and argument upon it was as follows:
This is a claim for eleven leagues of land called Moquelemos, which the claimant alleges, in his petition to the board
of cbmmissioners, was granted to him by his brother, Pie
Pico, in the month of May, 1844, and confirmed to him in
June, 1846. â€¢ The land lies on the Moquelemos river, in what
is now the county of Calaveras.
The documentary evidence of title produced by the claim.
ant is:

DE(EMBER TERII, 1859.

4U7

United States v. Pico.

1. A grant signed by Pio Pico, and countersigned by Jose
Matias Moreno, describing the land in question, dated at the
city of Los Angeles, on the 6th day of June, 1846.
2. A paper headed "Departmental Assembly of California,"
and signed Narciso Botello, deputy secretary, addressed to
Secretary Moreno, in which the fact is stated, that this grant,
and others which are named, were approved by the Departmental Assembly in that day's session.
NOTE.-The date of this paper (July 15, 1846) is certainly
the date which it truly bears. It is so in all the records, the
original Spanish as well as the translations.
3. A paper signed by Pio Pico and Jos6 Matias Moreno,
dated June 15, 1846, setting forth that the most excellent Departmental Assembly, "in session of to-day," decreed the approval of the grant in question.
This is all the documentary evidence in the case. There is
no petition, order of reference, information, decree of concession, map, or copy of the grant, found among the archives.
Nor map or diseno of the land was exhibited to the court below,
or is to be found upon the record sent here. There is no registry nor any kind of entry upon any book. The grant was
produced from the private custody of the grantee himself. So,
it appears, was the certificate of Pico and Moreno, that it had
been approved by the Departmental Assembly. Judge Hoffman distinctly declares that the only paper found in the archives
is the communication of Botello, transmitting the title deed,
and asserting its approval. Who placed that paper upon the
record, and how or when it came there, are questions not
easily solved. That it did not get there honestly, will be very
apparent to the court, long before this examination is finished.
No proof was offered of the genuineness of the paper with
Botello's name to it, and found among the archives. But, to
show that the other two papers, which were produced from
the private custody of the claimant, were not forgeriesNicholas II. Den was called, who testified that he knew the
handwriting of Pico and Moreno, and that their signatures to
these two papers were genuine.
On this evidence, the board*rejected the claim, declaring

ihat, in its opinion, the proofs and exhibits wore insufficient
to establish its validity. An appeal was taken by the claimant to the District Court, where the claimant calledCharles M. Weber, who states that the boundaries of the
land described in the grant can be identified. In the full of
1848, he learned, for the first time, that Pico had a claim to
this -land; which, adjoins that of the witness. He made a gift
to Pico of some small improvements that he had made on the
land. He knows of no stock that Pico ever had on the land.
Daniel Murphy says that, in 1848, he saw Pico on the land,
with some twenty men and some horses. The witness himsel afterwards had about 1,000 head of cattle upon it, and
Pico allowed him to occupy it with about 1,500 more; was on
the ranch, with Pico's consent, about eighteen months.
This was absolutely all the evidence in the case. No proof
of the documents was made by the testimony of the persons
whose names were signed to them. Neither the Governor
himself nor the countersigning secretary was called. Nobody
swore even to their handwriting, except Nicholas H. Den.
There was no evidence that the claimant ever had any possession; and his nearest neighbor, the owner and occupant of the
adjoining tract, not only knew of no possession, but never
even heard of the claim until after the discovery of the gold
mines, and the commencement of the city of Stockton in the
neighborhood. With his illegal and insufficient evidence of
the- documents, which the claimant had kept in his pocket
withoiat any evidence of possession or even claim, and without producing from the record a single entry to corroborate
the allegation of the grant, he had boldness enough to demand
a decree confirming his title and allowing his claim. The
judge manifestly did not believe that the grant was a genuine
one. He felt tbt the whole thing was a fabrication, but, in
his opinion, he was bound to treat it as genuine, because Nich61as H. Den was unimpeached and uncontradicted, and he had
declared .it to be his opinion that the signatures of Pico and
Moreno were written by themselves. But he adds, that any
one acquainted with the facility and unscrupulousness witli
which, in this class of cases, frauds have been committed, and

sustained by testimony apparently conclusive, a grant, unsupported either by evidence from the archives or by proof of
occupation of the land, must appear suspicious. He then
adds What seems to have finally determined him in favor of
allowing the claim. He says, in the case at bar, a document
is found in the archives, which affords the best, if not the only,
moral evidence of the genuineness of the grant.
The objections which the Government now makes to the
affirniance of this decree are those which follow:
1..The grant is made by the Governor to his own brother,
and is therefore void.
2. It is void, because Pio Pico, at the time of making it,
bad no authority, jurisdiction, or power, to make any grant in
this case, for wirt of a petition, investigation, and map, such
as the laws of 1824 and 1828 require in all such cases.
3. There is no record evidence of the grant, nor any explanation furnished of its absence, and therefore it is, to all intents
and purposes, the same as if no evidence at all of it had been
given.
4. It is a forgery. The proof of this is powerful and overwhelming. It is not possible to furnish any reason why the
grant was not entered upon the record, if it was really made
at the time it bears date. In addition to that, the journals of
the Departmental Assembly furnish very strong circumstantial
evidence against the genuineness of this title.
It will be observed that the letter of Botello to Moreno is
dated on the 15th of July, and it accompanies the title deeds
of this and two other claims. The letter, as well as the deeds,
professes to be sent for the information of his Excellency the
Governor; and if there is any truth in that letter, the Governor
could have had no information of it at any earlier period than
its date. Yet we find th Governor's certificate, which purports to be extracted from the minutes of the Departmental
Assembly, is dated on the 15th of June, just a month earlier
than Botello says it was approved. These certificates, if actually signed by the parties whose names are attached to them,
were made long after their date, and at a time when the 'parties who conctcted the fraud supposed that the journals of the

SUPREME COURT.
UntedZ States v. Pico.

Assembly had been irrecoverably lost. But those journals
have been found, are in the archives, have been fully authenticated, and'they show that no such grant as this to Andrea
Pico was before the Assembly, either on the 15th of June, or
on Ihe 15th of July, or on any other day. The journal contains a very full account of everything that was done by the
Assembly, especially with reference to land grants. The
whole proceedings of the body on the 15th of June are given,
and not a word is said about the approval of this or any other
land title. On the 15th of July, no session was held. There was
an adjournment from the 8th of July to the 24th of the same
month, which was the last day that the Departmental Assembly ever met. The journal affords the strongest reason to believe that Pio Pico was not at Los Angeles, where both the
grant and his certificate of approval are dated, at the times
when they respectively begar date. Pio Pico met the Assembly, and was in his seat, as President, on the 3d of June. The
journal says that, upon that day, a communication was received from the. Commandante General, in which Fremont's
invasion was mentioned, and the General requested the presence of his Excellency the Governor. At the next meeting
of the body, Francisco Figueroa presided, Pio Pico being absent. On the 15th of June, Figueroa presided again. On the
1st of July, an official communication from his Excellency the
Governor was read, dated. at Santa Barbara on the 28d of June,
transmitting copies of certain documents from the districts of
the north, and expressing his Excellency's desire to have this
honorable body near him, in order to consult with it upon
the management and means of saving the country. Another
document was also read from his Excellency, dated June 29,
with an invitation to the Assembly to-repair without delay to
Santa Barbara, to enact the necessary measures to save the
Department and chastise the invaders, making it [the Assembly] responsible before God and the nation, if it should neglect.tQ go to that point. At all the subsequent meetings of
the Legislature, Figueroa continued to be- President, down -to
Tue session of July 8, 1845; and at an extra session on the
24th of July, being the last day of the Assembly's existenc;

Pio Pico was present. Inasmuch as he was, upon the 3d of
June, requested to go to Santa Barbara, where the Commandante General was stationed, and as we see no more of his name
upon the journals.from that time until the 8th of July, it may
reasonably be supposed that he left on the 3d of June, or immediately afterwards, in pursuance of the summons sent to
him by the General. This very safe presumption will contradict the allegation that he issued a grant to his brother on the
0th of June; and it is very certain, from the journals, that he
was not at Los Angeles on the 15th of June, the date of his
pretended certificate of approval. On the 15th of July, there
was no session at all, and that makes it certain that Botello's
certificate is false, from beginning to end.
The argument of Mr. Gillet in the preceding case was applicable to this, and, in addition to the points therein reported,
the following is now added, because it contains references to
the former decisions of this court.
6. It is to be presumed that Governor Pico performed his
duty in relation to. the necessary preliminaries of this grant,
until the impeaching party proves to the contrary.
In all official transactions, it is a universal rule, that the
officer is presumed to have conformed to his official duty.
Whoever disputes it, must make his proof, or be silent. In
this case, we insist that this rule must be applied, If the law
required. the Governor to grant only on receiving petitions,
making references and receiving reports, then it is to be presumed that all-this was done. But references. and reports are
optional matters with him, and are not required unless he
chooses. The legal presumption is, that he received a petition, if that was necessary, before the grant; and there is no
evidence that he did not receive one, nor was this questioned
below. All that can be said is, that the claimant did not produce and prove it on the trial below. If such evidence were
necessary to make the grant a legal one, still it was not roquired to establish the equitable right, which can be proved
without proving a full legal right.
This presumption is really sustained by strong, if not con.

SU I'REMI1 COURT.
United States v. Pica.

elusive proof. The Governor says, in the grant, that the
grantee, "a Mexican by birth, has- solicited, for his personal
benefit and that of his family, the land known, &c., *
having first made the necessary inquiries and investigations
according to the requisitions of the laws and regulations," &c.
Those who deny that there was an application, cannot sustain
their position without charging the Governor with asserting a
falsehood, as well as omission of duty.
It is insisted on the other side that this statement of the
Governor in the grant is no evidence of the fact alleged. This
is an error. Even in case of private individuals, their statements, in notes, bonds, contracts, and deeds, are taken as true
among themselves, and can in but few cases be disputed. But
where an officer of Government makes a recital, stating that
he has performed certain things required by law.in the premises, such recitals are, unless otherwise provided lb statute,
taken and deemed to be true. The recitals bya sheriff in
deed, when he sells and conveys on execution, are always
deemed to be true. The recitals by a magistrate in a writ,
that an affidavit was made on which he issued the writ, are
taken to be true. When the President recites, in a proclamation or order, that certain things have occurred, they are always taken as true. In cases of an insurrection, or compliance or non-compliance with a treaty, this court has so held.
The production of a commission signed by the President,
reciting that the Senate had consented to the appointment, is
conclusive of the fact recited, and is also evidence that the
President had made the nomination. His signature to a land
patent is conclusive upon the Government, of the recitals it
contains. It is evidence of the survey, and that (except in
pre-emption cases) the land had been offered at public sale,
without which it could not be granted. The recital that
money had been paid under the act of 1820, or that the
grantee or his assignor was entitled to bounty land, cannot be
questioned by the Government. It is the same in the recitals
in patents to half-breed Indians. The recitals in a land claim
(confirmed by this court cannot be disputed by.the grantor or
grantee, or those claiming under either, by subsequent con-

veyafice. Those who dispute these recitals, where not estopped, must prove their allegations.
It is a rule of nearly universal application, that the recitals
by official personages, in papers made and issued in the line of
their duty, are deemed and taken to be true. Public business
could not be carried on without allowing such presumptions
to prevail. The rule is as applicable to a California Governor
in making a land grant, as to any other official person. His
recital that there was a.. application, &c., is just as much
to be relied upon as that in which lie states that the grantee
was a Mexican, or naturalized citizen, or of the secretar that
the grant had been recorded or confirmed by the Assembly.
In Fremont's case, the recitals in the grant were treated as
true and highly important. The Chief Justice said: "But the
grant, after reciting that Alvarado was worthy, for his patriotic services, to be preferred in-his pretensions for his personal
benefit and that'of his family, for the tract of land known by
the name of Maroposas, to the extent of ten square leagues,
within certain limits mentioned in the grant, and that the
necessary requirements, according to the provisions of the
laws and regulations, had been previously complied with, pro.
ceeds, in the name of the Mexican nation, to grant him the
aforesaid tract, declaring the same by that instrument to be
his property in fee, subject to the approbation of the Departmental Assembly, and the conditions annexed to the grant."
17 Howard, 558.
"And the grant was not made merely to carry out the colonization policy of the Government, but in consideration of
the previous public and patriotic services of the grantee. This
inducement is carefully put forth in the title papers." Id.
He further said: "It (consideration of personal merit) is an
acknowledgment of ajust and equitable claim."
Here the argument of the Chief Jus'tice rested on this point
wholly upon what the Governor recited in the grant or title
papers. The Chief Justice also, at page 562, speaks of the
fact ef the inability to furnish a map being "officially ad
mitted" by the Governor.
In Readings ease, Mr. Justice Wayne flisposed of certain

SUPREME UOURTÂ°
Unit ec state V. .Pico.

points made by the Attorney General by referring to and
adopting as true certain facts recited in the grant. He said:
"But the fact of Reading's Mexican naturalization is not an
open question in this case. The record admits the regularity
and genuiness of his documentary title for the land. The admission is good for all the necessary recitals in them, as it is
for the main purpose for which they were inserted in those
documents. That was a grant of the land. The recitals are
those "requisite conditions" stated in the second and third
paragraphs of the *decree of November 21, 1828, concerning
which the Governor is enjoined to seek information, which,
when affirmatively ascertained, make the foundation of the
Governor's exercise of his power to grant vacant lands."
"In his petition for a grant, Reading says he is a native of
the United States, and had resided in the country since the
year 1842. The Governor states him to be a Mexican by naturalization in the grant, and 'that as the proper proceedings
and investigations had been previously complied with according to the provisions and laws and regulations concerning the
matter,' he, in virtue of the authority vested in him, grants
the petitioner the land known as Buena Ventura. * * Now, this is not merely the language of clerical formality,
though it might be the same from usage in like cases, but it
is a declaration of the Governor's official and judicial conscience, that his power to make the grant has been used in a
fit case for the approval of the Departmental Assembly, or for
the decision of the Supreme Executive Government, in case
the action of the Assembly should make it necessary for him
to carry it there for its decision. We -onsider it conclusive
of the fact of the petitioner's Mexican naturalization, precluding all other inquiries about it, in our consideration of this
case, by the record."
18 Howard, 8, 9.
When Spanish and Mexican agents state that they hold
certain offices, and are authorized to make grants, their averments thus made are taken to be true, and so this court has
held. In Peralta's case, this court, by Justice Grier, said:
"cWehave frequently decided that the public acts of public

DECEMBER TERM, 1859.
United States v. Pco.

officers, purporting to be exercised in their official capacity,
and by public authority, shall not be presumed to be usurped,
but that a legitimate authority had been previously given, or
subsequently ratified. To adopt a contrary rule would lead
to infinite confusion and uncertainty of titles. The presumption arising from the grant itself makes it primafacie evidence
of the power of the officer making it, and throws the burden
of proof on the party denying it. The general powers of the
Governors and other Spanish officers to grant lands within the
colonies in full property, and without restriction as to quantity, and in reward for important services, were fully considered in this court in the case of the United States v. Clarke,
8 Peters, 486."
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of the
United States for the northern district of California.
The appellee presented to the board of commissioners a
claim for eleven square leagues of land, known by the name
Moquelamos, -situate in the county of Calaveras, California.
The board rejected the claim; but, on appeal to the District
Court, and the production of some further proof, that court
affirmed it.
The preliminary proceedings required by the regulations of
1828, before a grant of the public lands, were not produced,
ifany existed. The only evidence of the title is a grant of the
tract by a formal title to the claimant, dated Los Angeles,
6th June, 1846, signed by the Governor, Pio Pico, and J. M.
Moreno, the Secretary of State, and two other papers, relied
on as furnishing proof that the grant was approved by the
Departmental Assembly. One of them ii a certificate to that
effect of the Governor and Secretary, bearing date 15th June,
1846; the other purports to be a communication from N.
Botello, deputy secretary of the Departmental Assembly, of
the approval, to Moreno, Secretary of State, for the information of the Governor. This approval, according to the deputy
sedretary of the Assembly, was in a session held on the 15th
JTuly, 1846. The paper was found among the Mexican archives.

United States v. Vallejo.

The other documents-the grant and certificate of approvalcame from the hands of the claimant. No record of them was
found among the Mexican archives or in any book, nor is
there any evidence of possession or occupation deserving
notice or consideration.
The case falls within the principles and is governed by the
views of the court in the case of the United States v. Teschmaker and others, decided at this tbrm. Besides the suspicious character of the grant, it appears to be wholly destitute
of meri.

The decree below reversed, and the case remanded for further evidence.

THE UNITED STATES, APPELLANTS, V. MAiIAO G. VAL~wo.
Where neither the grant of land in California, nor the certificate of approval by
the Departmental Assembly, are found among the Mexican archives, nor tho
record of them upon any book of records, but both papers came from thbo
hands of the claimants, the case will be remanded for further evidence.

Tuis was an appeal from the District Court of the United
States for the northern district of California. It was similar,
in many of its circumstances, to the two preceding cases.
The state of the title is set forth in the argument of the Atto,;uey General.
It was argued by the Attorney General and Mr. Stanton for
the United States, and by Mr. Phillips for the appellee.
The Attorney General thus explained the title:
This is a claim for a tract of land called Yulupa, containing
three square leagues, more or less. The claim rests upon an
alleged grant by Governor Micheltorena to Miguel Alvarado,
dated November 23, 1844. The claim was rejected by the
board, but confirmed by the District Court. In support of
this claim, a paper, purporting to be a "titulo" is produced,
signed, "Manuel Micheltorena," and attested by "Francisco
