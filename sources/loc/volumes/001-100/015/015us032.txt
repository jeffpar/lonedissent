HUNTER

et a]. v. BRYANT.

H., in contemplation of marriage with B., gave a bond for 5,000 dollars, and interest to trustees, to secure to B. a suppurt, duainU
the marriage, and after the death of H., in case &heshould survive
him, and to their child or children, in case he should survive herj
with condition that if H. should, within the time of his life, or withiq
one year after the marriage, (whichsoever of the said terms should
first expire,) convey to the trustee some good estate, real or personal, sufficientto secure the annual payment of 300 dollars for the
separate use of his wife during the marriage, and also sufficient to
secure the payment of the said 5,000 dollars to her use in caso sho
should survive her husband, to be paid within six months after his
death; and in case of her death before her husband, to be paid to
their child or children; or, if H. shoula die before B., and by his
will should, within a year from its date. make such devises and bequests as should be adequate to these provisions, then the bond to be
void. H. died, leaving his widow B. and a son, hm uig, by his last
will, devised a tract of 1,000 acres of land in the Mississippi territox , to his son in fee; a tract of 10,000 acres in Kentucky, equally
between his wife and son, with a devise over to her in fee of the
spn's moiety, if he died before he attained "the lawful ago to will
it away." And the residue of his estate, real and personal, to bo
divided equally between his wife and son with the same contingent
dpvise over to her as with regard to the tract of 10,000 acres of land.
The value of the property thus devised to her, beside the contingent interest, might have been estimated, at the time of H.'s death,
at 5,000 do'lars. B. subsequently died, having made a nuncupativo
will, by which she devised all her estate, "whether vested in her by
the will of her deceased husband or otherwise," to be divided between her son and the plaintiff below, (hryant,) with a contingent

devise of the whole to the survivor. The son afterwards died, and
the plaintiff brought this bill to charge the lands of H. with the pay-,

APPEAL from the circuit court for the District
of Pennsylvania. This cause was argued by Mr.
Key and Mr. Hopkinson, for the appellants and
defendants, and by Mr. Jones, for the plaintiffs
and respondents.

Mr. Justice JoHsoN, delivered the opinion of the
court.

This is an appeal from a decreei in equity, in
the district of Pennsylvania, on a bill filed by Thomas Y. Bryant, against the legal representatives of
John Hare.
The object of the bill is to charge the lands of
Andrew Hare, now deceased, through John Hare, to
the appellants, defendants in the court below, with
the payment of a bond for 5000 dollars, and interest, given by Andrew Hare, in contemplation of
marriage with Margaret Bryant, the mother of John
Hare.
The land lies partly in the state of Kentucky, and
partly hi the Mississippi territory, and five of the
defendants live in the state of Pennsylvania, the
sixth in the state of Virginia. The bill was origin'OL. IT.

of John Hare; but the name,of Mary Dickinson, the
resident in Virginia, being stricken out by leave of
court, five only were made defendants below.
The bond is executed to. George Hunter and
William Hunter, two of these appellants. The penalty is in the usual form, and bears date the 10th
of November, 1789.. The condition is in these
words: "Whereas, by the permission of God, a
marriage is intended to be had and solemnized between the above bound Andrew Hare, and Iviargaret Bryant, of the city of Philadelphia, spinster, and
the said Andrew Hare, in consideration of the said
marriage, and to secure a decent and competent support to and for his said intended wife, as well during
the marriage as after his death, in case she should
survive him, and to all and every the child or children which may be born of the said marriage, in

sum of 5,000 Mexican dollars, part of the estate
whereof, by the blessing of God, he is nov possessed, and the interest and income thereof accrui'ng

otherwise the same shall remain in full force and virtue at law, in this state of Pennsylvania, and in all
other states or kingdoms whatever."
The marriage accoidingly took effect, and oxcept when the husband was necessarily absent, in
prosecution of his business as a merchant, the parties lived constantly together in great harmony, and
"in a style fully consonant with the husband's resources. In 1793 he established himself in Lexington, Kentucky, and was engaged.in mercantile transpactions until his death, which happened in 1799.
By his will Andrew Hare devised a tract of 1,000
acres of land lying in the Mississippi territory to his
son John, in fee. A tract of 10,000 acres in the
state of Kentucky equally between his wife and son,
with a devise over to her in fee of the son's moiety if
he died before he attained ': the lawfbl age to will
it away." And the rest and residue of his estate,
real and personal, he gives to be equally divided
between his wife and son, with the same contingent
devise over to her as is given Iwith regard to the
Kentucky tract of 10,000 acres. The value of the
property thus devised to her, independent of the
contingent interest which has since fallen, might reasonably have been estimated at the time of the tes,
tator's death at about five thousafid dollars.

tive will, by which she devised all her estate,
"whetheix vested in her by the will of Andrew
Hare, her deceased husband, or otherwise," to be
divided between her son John and the complainant
below, Thomas Y. Bryant, with a contingent devise
of the whole to the survivor.
John Hare died, aged about II years; and under
this nuncupative will it is, that -Thomas Y. Bryant
derives his right to this bdnd. According to the
laws of Kentucky this will was not sufficiedkl tq pass
the landed estate of Margaret Hare, but it is good
as to the personal estate, including the bond, which
was the subject of this suit.
The defence set up in the answer below is, that
the provision made in the will of the husband for
his wife must be taken in satisfaction of this bond,
inasmuch as he would otherwvise have left his child,
who ought to have been, and evidently was, the primary object of his care, probably destitute of support. And this court unanimously acquiesce in the
correctness of this reasoning. For, every bequest
is but a bounty, and a bounty must be taken as it is
given. Positive words are not indispensably necessary to attach a condition. It may arise from implication, and grow out of a combination of circumstances which' go to show, that without attaching
such condition to a bequest, the primary views and
prominent duties of the testator will be pretermitted. In this case, in addition to the striking impro.
bability of the testator's intending to leave his child
destitute, or even dependent, there are two circumstances which tend to show that the testator had no

expectation that in addition to the provision for his
widow, his estate was to be made liable for this
heavy debt. First, the condition of the bond holds
out the alternative of making provision by will, in
satisfaction of it. And, although we do not accede to the construction contended for, that this necessarily extended to his whole life, but think it was,
in legal strictness, limited by the latter words of the
condition to his death within one year, yet the words
in. the ptior part of the condition "within the term
of his life," were well calculated to excite in the
mind of a man whose habits of thinking had not been
corrected by technical exercise, an idea that he was
legally, as well as conscientiously, complying with
his obligatioii when executing this will. Secondly.
The principal part of his bounty to his wife ponsists of the one half of the rest and residue of his
estate, with a conitingent devise over to her of the
other half on the decease of his son; thus disposing
of the whole, and giving to her 'the one half of the
natural and ordinary fund for the payment of this
bond; a disposition of his effects that would have
been idle under the supposition that this bond was
to be exacted of his estate.
But, in the actual state of the rights and interests of these parti6s, at least in the view which this
court takes of ihem, this question becomes a veiy immaterial one. For, the complainant, Bryant, acquires nothing of the estate of Andrew Hare, under
the will of Mrs. Hare, but that part of the personality
which she acquired under the residuary bequest of
her husband. And this being unquestionably the

fund first to be applied to the payment of debts, it
must. in his hands, be first subjected to the payment
of this debt. It is only as connected with Mrs. Hare's
acquiescence or election to take under the will that
the question of satisfaction becomes material. In
which case we should be bound to dismiss the bill
altogether, on the ground of satisfaction. But here
we are of opinion, that the evidence of election is
not sufficient to bind Mrs. Hare. That h' was perfectly at liberty to reject the 'provision under the
will of her husband, and rest alone on her bond, is
unquestionable. And if this election was never deliberately made in her lifetime, there can be no reason fbr denying the extension of it to her representative, Bryant. He now makes that election in demanding the payment of this bp.d, and we conceive
that nothing unequivocally' expressive of that election has before occurred, at least nothing that ought
to preclude it. If the will had expressly given the
property devised to her in satisfaction of this bond,
she would have been put on her guard, and more
cautious conduct might have been required of her;
but, although a court may raise the implication, she
was not-bound to do it, and her mind was not ne.
cessarily led to an election. It is true, that in her
will she notices the property acquired under her husband's will; but this is perfectly consistent with the
idea that she took, under her husband's will, something in addition to her interests under the bond independent of that will.. We are therefore of opinion,
that the complainant is entitled to satisfaction of this
bond; and as in the course of events, the interests of

the obligebs, who stood in the relation of trustee t6
Margaret Bryant, have become hostile to those of
the cestui que trust, he must have the aid of this
court to enforce it. The only questions, then, are#
how the bond shall be stated, and how the money
shall be raised. And here the question occurs, on
the allowance of interest during the husband's lifetime.
On this subject the majority of the Court is satisfied, that actual maintenance is equivalent to the payment of a sum secured for separate maintenance. It
is true, the husband cannot claim his election; but,
if the wife and her trustees never demand it, it is
considered as an acquiescence, or waiver, on their
part, and this court will not afterwards enforce
payment. [2 P. Wins. 84. 3 P. Wins. 355. 2
Atkin. 84. 4 Bro. Ch. Cas. 326.] In the present case, there is nothing in the bond that holds
out the idea of making this interest an accumulating fund; no demand of a settlement was ever
made; the parties lived together in perfect har.
mony, and the wife was maintained in a style
fully adeq uate to the provision stipulated for. This
bond- was intended as a provision against the husband's inability or unwillingness to maintain his wife;
but whilst steadily pursuing.his avocation as a marchant, and faithfully discharging his duties as a husband, the reasonable conjecture is, that it was.thought
really best for his family not to withdraw so large a
sum from his small capital. If the trustees, or the
wife had desired that the settlement should be made,

The only remaining question is, how the money is
to be raised, or on what :funds the bond' is to be
charged. And here there can be no doubt that the
first fund to be exhausted is the residue of the estate ;
and of this, the personal residue first in order. This,
of course, sweeps all that part of Andrew Hare's estate that Bryant acquired under the will of Mrs.
Hare; and included in this we find Hustin's bond
for 3,272 dollars 86 cents. The one half of this
bond was decreed in the court below to be an equitable offset against Hare's bond. All we know on the
subject of this offset is extracted from the confessions
of the complainant himseh'. From these it appears
that the testator, Hare, held a bond ot Hustin's for
the delivery of a quantity of pork. This bond it
was purposed t6 exchange for one for the delivery of
a quantity of tobacco, and the testator, in his lifetime, despatched the complainant as his agent with
instructions to effectuate the exchange. To enablo
him to do so, he assigned the bond for the pork to
the complainant, instead of executing a common power of attorney. Whilst absent for this purpose, and
before he had completed the arrangement with Hustin, Hare died; and Bryant proceeded no farther,
until he had consulted Mrs. Hare and-Mr. Todd, as
executrix and executor of the will of Hare, on the
propriety of proceeding. "On conferring with Mrs..
Riare, and advising with Mr. Todd," to 4ise Bryant's

own equivocal language, he' effected a negotiatior,
and having received the tobacco, took it down to
1New-Orleans, where, not meeting with a ready sale,
he deposited it with one Moore, the factor and correspondent of Hare, in his lifetime. He took Moore's
receipt for the tobacco so depositdd, and all that yo
are told of the transaction subsequently is, that at the
insiance of Mr. Todd, he assigned that receipt to
some house under the firm of John Jordan & Co.,
but who they were, or what finally became of the tobacco, the case does not show; and, for aught that
appears to us, the proceeds of that adventure may at
this day lie in the hands of the factor, subject to the
order of the executor of Andrew Hare.
The court below thoughtthese facts sufficient to
charge Mrs. Hare with one half the amount of Hustin's bond. But this cou't are of opinion that the
evidence is not sufficient for them to decide finally
on the subject. Although it be generafly true, that
the. executor, who by taking an inferior secuirity or
unreason.ably extending time of payment, brings a
loss upon his testator's estate, shall himself be liable,
yet there are many objections to applying that principle to this case. The executor, who takes charge
of the affairs of a man in trade, must 'necessarily,
on the winding up of his affairs, be allowed a
reasonale latitude of discretion; and in general,
where there is manifest fidelity, diligence, and ordinary judgment displayed, this court will always with some reluctance enforce the rigid rules

of estates, to impose upon the conduct of executors.

He

says that he did it "after conferring with Mrs. Hare,
and advising with Mr. Todd." But it does not follow that either of them assented because they were
consulted, pr that they did any thing more than express an opinion on the expediency of thie measure.
Neither of them had then qualified, nor was it at all
certain that they would qualify, and the only person
then empowered to act on this subject was Bryant
himself; who, by virtue of the assignment which he
held, possessed a power which legally survived his
principal. Under this assignment it was that the negotiation was effected, and not by virtue of any pow.
er derived to him from the supposed assent of the
executrix. Moreover. admitting the consent of the, executrix, it is still doubtful whether any change of security did in fact take place. For, Hustin still remained the debtor-the articles of agreement substituted for the original bond bear the.aspect of
the purchase of a bond rather than the relinquishment of an advantage; the greater part, if not the
whole balance, of the original debt was also payable in tobacco; and if the loss finally sustained
proceeded, a- is probable, from the insolvency of the
factor, and w,' t the reduced value of the commodity,
this was b -r.o means a necessary consequence or the
