A-libel against the commander of a squadion calling on him to proceed
to adjudication, or to make restitution in value, of a vessel and cargo, detained for search by the captain of a frigate belonging to the
squadron, and lost while in his possession. Libel dismissed.
The commander of a squadron is liable to individuals for the trespasses of those under his comroand, in case of positive or permissive
orders, or of actual presence and co-operation. But qu4Wre, how
far is he responsible in other caseb.
Where a capturehas actually taken place, with the assent, express or
implied, of the commander of a squadron, the prize master may be
considered as a bailee to the use of the whole squadron, who are
to share in the prize money, and thus the commander may be made
responsible; but not so as to mere trespasses, unattended with a
conversion to the use of the squadron.
The commander of a single ship is responsible for the acts of those
under his command; as are, likewise, the owners of privateers for.
the conduct of the commanders appointed by them.
To Iletain for examination, is a right which a belligerant may exercise over every vessel, except a national vessel, which he meets
with on the ocean.
The principal right necessarily carries with it all the means essential
to its exercise ; among these may, sometimes, be included the assumption of the disguise of a friend or an enemy, which is a lawful
stratagem of war. If, in consequence of the use of this stratagem,

Whenever an officer seizes a vessel as pr'ze, he is bound to commit
her to the care of a competent prize-master and crew; not because
the original crew, when left on board, (in the case of a seizure qf
the vessel of a citizen, or neutral,) are released from their duty
without the assent of the master, but from the want of a right to
subject the captured crew to the authority of the captor's officer.
Dut this rule does not extend to the case of a mere detcntlon for
examination, which the commander of the cruising vessel may onforce by orders from his own quarter deck, and may, thereforo,
send an officer on board the vessel detained, in order more conveisiently to enforce it, without taking the vessel out of the possession of her own officers and crew.

enemy. This produced a very general determination, on the part of the crew, to take no further concern in the navigation of the schooner. When
boarded by lieutenant Nicholson of the Congress,
the schooner was in the state of confusion to be expected from such a determination. le ordered the
master to take one of his mates, and his papers, and
go on board the frigate. The captain, after giving
some orders to his second mate to adjust the sails of
the schooner, which were not complied with, went
with his first mate and papers, in the frigate's boat,
to the Congress. Lieutenant Nicholson,. on being
asked by a boy what frigate it was, said it was the
Shannon; immediately afterwards he undeceived the
supercargo, whom he recognised as an old acquaintance, but said he was ordered not to make himself

to disclose it. Upon endeavouring to restore order,

crew they were not prisoners, endeavoured to prevail on them to return to their duty; they persisted
in refusing; in consequence of which (the sea being

3d. That, at all events, Commodore Rodgers was

The neglect of the captured crew, in. refusing to
do duty, is analogous to the case of Virtue v.Birda
where the plaintiff declared that he was employed
by the defendant to carry a load of timber from W.
to L,to be laid down where the defendant should appoint, and that he carried it; when the defendant,
having appointed no place where it should be laid
down, the plaintiff's horses were detained in the
cold, by which some of them died, and the rest were
spoiled; after a verdict for the plaintiff, judgment
was arrested; for it was the plaintiff's' own fault that
lie did not take out his horses, and lead them about;
or he might have unloaded the timber in any proper
place, and returned. So, also, in Butterfield v. Forrester, which was an action on the case for obstructing a highway, by means of which the plaintiff, who
was riding along the road, was thrown down with
his horse, and injured; it appeared that he was riding
with great violence and want of ordinary care, without which he might easily have avoided the obstruction. It was, therefore, decided, that he could
not recover; for that two things must concur to support the actibn: an obstruction in the road by the
fault of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care,
to avoid it, on the part of the plaintiff. Upoh the

principle of these cases, the appellant is exempted
all liability. Nor is he responsible upon the
Sfrom

ground of the liability of a master and principal for
the miseondtict of a servant and agent. Superiors
in these relations of life are answerable only for acts
in the ordinary line of the duty of the servant and
agent, or in consequence of the special orders of the
superior. But this principle, with its limitations,
does not apply to the case, ofa commander of a squadron. He does not elect his qfficers. They are appointed by the government, and amenable 'only to a
court martial. No officer, military or naval, would
undertake so frightful a responsibility; and to impose it upon the commander of a fleet or squadron
would be to incapacitate him from the performance
of his duty. There is no testimony, positive or presumptive, that Commodore Rodgers gave any orders
whateVer to practice the stratagem in question.
The authority of the Mentore shows, that Ihe is not
liable, constructively, for the conduct of the officers
under his command; nor is there any one case to
show that he is thus liable. The Der Mohr" is, apparently only, such a case. It only proves that a superior officer may be placed in the same relation with
that of a principal, in regard 'to his agent. In that
case, the captors had a right of property in 'the captured vessel, inasmuch as by the law of England
captors have the entire interest in prizes; and any
person may be appointed prize-master, and so become the agent of the whole squadron, the commanCl R,ob. 179.

der of which would, consequently, be responsible.
Public policy does not require the establishment of
the principle contended for on the other side, since
the injured party may have, recourse to the actual
wrong doer, and may seek redress by complaining
to the government.of his misconduct.
Mr. D. B. Ogden, contra. The case cited from
Levinz is not parallel ; and that from East is one of
gross folly and want of common prudence and caution on the part of the plaintiff. It is inapplicable,
because it was not in the power of the libellant in
this case to save his property from destruction.
But the present question is not to be determined by
the narrow principles of the common law; it is a
marine trespass, which must be tried by the more
liberal rules of the marine law. The right of visitation and search is not, and cannot be denied; but it
is not essentially necessary to the due exercise of
the right that the master should be taken out of his
vessel: it is only necessary to send a boarding officbr
to make the proper examination and inquiries; but
the belligerant cruisers have no right to proceed
further, until they have determined to send in the
vessel for adjudication. When this determination is
made, a competent prize-master and crew should
be put on board, instead of leaving the original
crew without control or regulation. A belligerant
has a right to practice deception, as a stratagem of
war; but this right, which may cause a wrong to a
neutral, or fellow citizen, must be exercised at the
peril of the captors. Either the seizure of the Elea-

Sthe former, then the captors had no right to require
the assistance of the crew of the captured vessela
who were not bound to assist in navigating her. If
the latter, then the captors had no right to take out
the master and mate, leaving the crew without any
regular chief competent to navigate the vessel. The
case of the Der Mohr was, indeed, determined on
general principles of law; on the ground that the
prize-master was constituted agent of the captorsf
and the vessel (which was innocent) was used as a
vehicle to bring in the cargo, which last alone was
liable to suspicion. But here the tre=ass is joint;

misconduct of the prize-master. The case of tie FEanor.
Der Mohr, which has been so often referred to,
makes the senior officer responsible for tile appointment of a prize-master by his jbnior officer, though
there was no personal misconduct imputable to either.
In the case now before the court. the proctmcdle cause
of the loss was the refusal of the seamen to work.
The ullimate cause was the deception practised by
the captors in representing themselves as enemies;
and whether the crew were justifiable in refusing
obedience, or not, their disobedience. was a conseruence of the stratagem practised by the captors,
and they are responsible. On the first suppoi:tion,
they are liable; because they ought to have put a
prize crew on board. On the second, because the
itratagem was practised at their peril, ant it depended upon the event of the searcn whether they
would be justified; for this mode of warfare is not
to be practised at the expense of individuals pursuing an innocent and lawful commerce. The case oft

the libellant have no means of indemnity, or if that
indemnity should be exacted of men whose characters and conduct were so far above all imputation

the commander of a squadron be liable to individuals for the trespasses of those under his command is
. question-on which it would be equally incorrect to
lay down a general proposition either negatively or
affirmatively. In case of positive or permissive orders, or in case of actual presence and co-operation,
there could not be a doubt of his liability. But on
the other hand, when we consider the partial indepondence of each commander of a vessel, and that the association is not a subject of contract, 'but ibunded on

than adopting his actions as the actions of the conn,
nder; and placing him in a command which requires skill, integrity, oi prudence, makes the cowmafider the pledge to the individual fbr his competence to discharge the duties of -we undertaking.
With these views of the subject we should have
found no difficulty in deciding on the' liability ot
Captain Smith, of the Congress, had he been a party to'thislibel, and .the facts of the case had made
out a marine trespass in' himself, or in Lieutenant
Nicholson, or a want of competence or dqe care in
the latter to dimcharge the command assigned him.
But we are of opinion that no one act is proven in
the case which did not comport with the fair, honorable, and reasonable exercise of the rights of war.
To detain for examination is a right which a belliw
gerant may exercise over every vessel, not a national vessel, that he meets with on the ocean. And
whatever may be the injury that casually results to
an individual from the act of another while pursuing
the reasonable exercise of an established right, it is
his misfortune. The law pronounces it damnum
absgue injuria, and the individual from whose act it
proceeds is liable neither at law nor in the forum of
conscience. And the principal right necessarily carties with it also all the means essential to its exercise.
Thus, in the present case, a vessel must be pursued
in order to be detained for examination. But if in
the pursuit she had been dismasted, and upset or
stranded, or run on shore and lost, it would have been
an unfortunate case, but the pursuing vessel would
haye stood acquitted. The counsel in argument

.-OF THE .UNITED STATES.

have not denied the general doctrine, but have en-'
deavoured to show that the commander of the Congress had unreasonably exercised the right of detention.
1st. By the deception, in passing himself off for an
enemy, thereby reducing the crew to a state of insubordination.
2d. By taking out both the master and the mate,
and thus removing the possibility of bringing the
seamen back to their duty.
3d. By devesting the master of his command,
without putting a competent crew on board to navigate her.
On the first of these grounds, it is only necessary
to remark, that, to assume the guise of a friend or an
enemy, is, in legitimate warfare, an act the most familiar and frequent in its occurrence. It is so ordinary a ruse de guerre, that it ought rather to be
expected than the display of real colours. And, innumerable cases that have come before this court
prove, that in the actual state of things during the
late war it became as necessary to practice the dec~ption upon our citizens as upon a neutral or an
enemy. We, therefore, see nothing reprehensible
in this. But on what ground could the crew assume
the right of judging for themselves on this subject,
and of abandoning their duty before they were actually made prisoners? Suppose the frigate had
been an enemy, it did not follow that their vessel
must be made prize, and they were unquestionably
unpardonable in abandoning their duty? Their, do"rgso, was by no means a. necessary consequence

of ordering their officers on board the frigate, nor
ought the captain of the Uongress to have anticipaThe
91eknor. ted such a state of thrins, as their vessel was reduced to, by their misconduct. They were bound to
obey the second mate in me absence of their other
officers; and if they had done so, this mislortune would
not have happened. So thr from actually devesting
him of his command, it appears, that Nicholson's orcers were addressed to him, and only addressed to
the men to try 'his personal iniluence in bringing
them to order.
To the second and third grounds, the Attention of
this court has been drawn with peculiar torce. Either
of them appeared to be an irregularity, which the
reasonable exercise of the right of search did not
strictlV justify. But, upon a close examination of
the testimony, we are of opinion, that neither of those
grounds is supported by the evidence. It is true,
that both the master ana first mate wure t'lcen on
board the frigate, and the master and supercargo
ay they were both ordered on board. But NicholSon, the boarding officer, who certainly knew best
ivhat orders he gave, swears that he ordered the
181.

master to go on board with

."

one of his mates,"

thus leaving it to his election to choose between them;
he farther swears, that these were the orderd he received from the captain. And there is a thct in tho
case, which makes it probable, that the master of
the schooner himself called on the first mate to attend him, for at that time the second mate was stationed at the bow, in charge of sinking certain de-

snatches, in case of capture.

Had tk matiter re

O? THE t-NITED STAtESI

knonstrated against taking his first mate along with
him, he would have done his duty, and perhaps saved
his vessel. On the third point, it is unquestionably
true, that, whenever an officer eizes a vessel as
prize, he is bound to commit her to the care of a
competent officer and crew. Not that the priginal
crew, when left on board, in case of seizure of the
vbssel, of a citizen or neutral, ale released from their
duty without the assent of the maste ; for they are
bound to attend the vessel, as she may be discharged, and pursue her original destination. But the
obligation to man the prize, results from the want of
a right to subject the crew of the captured vessel
to the authority of his own officer. If, then, this vessel had been seized as prize, And no one put'on
board but the prize-master, without any undertaking
of the original ship's company to navigate her under
his orders, it is very questionable whether the appellants would not have been liable fqr any loss that
followed, from the insubordination of the crew. Foi
after capture, as before observed, the prize-master
becomes the bailee of the squadron, who are to share
in the partition of the proceeds.
But we are of opinion that this Was a mere case
of detention for search; that the vessel was never
actually taken out of possession of her own officers;
that the captain-of the Congress had a right to detain the 'essel by orders from his own quarter-deck,
and that the officers of the schooner, at their peril,
were bound to obey ; that Lieutenant Nicholson was
left on board for Dn other purpbse than to enforce,

fault or folly of their own crew.
One argument, insisted on'at the bar, it is proper
for this court to notice before we conclude. It was
contended, that the master of the Eleanor ought not
to have been removed from his vessel; that the right
of search only authorited the sending of an officer
on board to examine her papers. But we think
otherwise. The modern usages of war authorize
the bringing of one of the principal officers on board
the cruising 'vessel, with his papers, for examination.
To devest her of both her principal officers, without
putting on board her, for the tir'e, a competent offi-'
cer and crew, would certainly be irregular. But it
is for the interest of the commercial world, that the
investigation should be made by the commander
himself, and not left to any subordinate officer. In
that case it would, be absurd, to require of the commander of the commissioned vessel to quit his command, for the purpose of making the necessary examinations.
We.are, upon the whole, of opinion, that the court
below erred; that the decree must be annulled, and
'
the libel dismissed.
