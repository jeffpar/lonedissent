A verdict is bad, if it varies from the issue in a substantial matter, or
if it find only a part of that which is in issue; and, though the court
may give form toageneral finding, so as to make it harmonize with
the issue, yet, if it appears thai the finding is different from the issue, or is confined to a part only of the matter in issue, io judgment
can he rendered upon the verdict.

that certain merchandise imported, and re-shipped for exportation,
should not be re-landed within the U. S., and that the certificate
and other proofs required by law, of the delivery of the same, without the limits of the U. S., should be produced at the collector's ofice within one year from the date of the bond; an issfe was formed

But if the party, instead of properly taking advantage of the irregularity in the proceedings, enters his appearance in the eircuit court,

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This was an action o debt instituted in the .district court of Maryland by the United States, against
Robert Patterson, the plaintiff in error, upon a bond,
dated the 2d of Augus t, 1809, in the penalty of
35,000 dollars, with condition that certain merchandise, which had been imported into the United States,
and which the said Patterson had then reshipped,
in order to export the same to Tonningen, should
not be relanded in any port or place within the Vnited States, and that the certificate and other proofs re-

After the declaration was filed in the district court,
and the defendant had entered his appearance and
taken defence, a writ of certiorari, issued from the
circuit to the district court, in obedience to which the
record of the proceedings in that court was certified
and gent up to the circuit 'court. Inthis court the
defendant again took defence, and after sundry imparlances, and having had oyer of the bond and condition, he pleads, 1st. Performance generally of the
condition. 2d. That the merchandise mentioned in
the condition of the -bond was not relanded in the
United States, and that the certificate, and other
proofs required by law of the delivery of the same
at Archangel, in Russia, were produced at the said
collector's office, within one year from the date ofthe
said bond. 3d. That the said merchandise, or any
part thereof, was not relanded in the United States,
and that the certificates and other proofs required by
law, of th delivery of the same at Archangel, in
Russia, were produced to tlhe said collector's office,
on the 11th day of November, in the year. 1811.
The replication to the first plea alleges a breach. of
the condition of the bond, in not producing to the
said collector's office, the certificate add other proofs
required by law of the -relanding in some place without the limits of the United States, within one year
from the.date of the said bond, to which a rejoinder

ed. The same issue is formed upon the second plea,
and to the third plea a general demurrer was put in.
The demurrer was, upon argument, sustained, and
judgment was entered against the defendant for the
penalty of the bond.
Ajury:was afterwards impannelled to try the issue
who found the following verdict, viz. "that the within-mentionel writing obligatory is the deed of the
within-named Robert Patterson, &c., and they find
there is really and justly due upon the said writing
obligatory the sum of 23,989 dollars 58 cents."
Upon this verdict the court gave judgment in favour of the United States, fbr 35,000 dollars, to be
released on ie payment of the above sum assessed
by the jury, fiom which judgment a writ of error
was obtained to remove the cause to this court.
The'court considers it to be unnecessary to decide
the questions which were argued at the bar, as the
verdict is so defective that no judgment can be rendered upon it.
The issue, which the jury were sworn to try was,
whether the certificate, and other proofs required by
law, of the delivery of the cargo, at some place without the limits of the United States, were produced
at the collector's office at Baltimore, within one
year from the date of the bond. The verdict does
not find the raatter in issue one way or the other, but
finds that the bond in the declaration mentioned is
the deed of the defendant, and that there is justly
due to the United States, upon the said bond, a cor-

deed, therefore he was indebted to the United
States.
The rule of law is prencise upon this point. A verdict
is bad, if it varies from the issue in a substantial matter, or if it find only a part of that which is" in issue.
The reason of the rule is obvious; it results from the
nature and the end of the pleading. Whether thejutry
find a general or a special verdict, it is their duty to
deide the very point in issue; and although the court
in which the cause is tried may give form to a general finding, so as to make it harmonize with the issue, yet, if it appears to that court, or to the appellate court, that the finding is different from the issue,
or is confined to a part only of the matter in issue,
no judgment can be rendered upon the vei'dict.
It is true, -that if the jury find the issue, and something more, the latter part of the finding will be rejected as surplusage; but this rule does not apply to
a case where the facts found in the verdict are substantially variant from those which are in issue.
The court deems it proper to take some rtice of
the mode of proceeding, for removing this cause from
the district to the circuit court. It is believed to bt
novel ii the practice of the courts ot the United
States; and it certainly wants the authority of law to
sanction it. There is no act of congress which authorizes a circuit court to issue a compulsory. process
