v.

That the defendant when he received the flour, and
long after he shipped it, was an infant under the age of
twenty-one years. Whereupon the court, at the prayer
of the defendant, instructed the jury that if.they found
the facts as stated, the defendant was not liable tipon
the count for trover.
The second exception was the admission of evidence
of the defendant's infancy.
The third exception stated that, " uppn the facti
aforesaid,(the facts in the first bill of exceptions mentioned,) the plantiff prayed the cobrt to instruct the
jury that kf the) shall be of opinion that the defendant
was under the age of twenty-one years, and between the
age of nineteen and twenty years, and-that the defendant
.fliis own head shipped the flour to the West Indies,
in a vessel which has been lost by the perils of the sea,
and that the said shipment was made with other flour,
on account of his father Joseph Smith, in such case the
defendant has thereby committed a tort in regard to
the plaintiff, for wvhich he is liable in this action, notwithstanding his infancy aforesaid, which instruction
the court refused to giive.
The verdict and judgment being against the plaintiff,
he brought his writ of error.

3. Infancy cannot be given in evidence upon the
issue of not guilty.
It is admitted that if the possessionhad been obtained by a tort, the infant would be liable; but ,it is contended that the possession having been rightfully ob.
tained, a subsequent misapplication of the property
by ai infant cannot be a conversion unless it be ac
tually a conversion to his own use.
But there are no cases to justify such a doctrine,
and it is contrary to the principies of analogous cases.
In an action of trespass for inesne profits infancy is no
bar, although he becomes -a trespasser by implication of
law. Latch. 21. 1 Bac. Abr. 132. 1 Esp. Rep. it%2

Although infancy may be given in evidence upon

Upon not guilty, ihe defendant cannot give in evidence
a license, nor a right to away, nor any other matter

Any act which, if done by a person of full age, would
be a conversion, will be a conversion if done by an
infant.
In the present case the bill of lading, which is a negotiable instrument, being in the name of Joseph
Smith, the plaintiff had no power or control over iti
It would unquestionably be a conversion if done by an
adult. The only question is, whether the nature of the
act'is altered by being done. by.an infant. 1 -,Tinm

the tort. If it had been brought upon the-contradtj
infancy would have been a bar.
The case is clearly within the reason of the law of
infancy, and it cannot be, in the power of the plaintiff
.by his form of action to deprive the defendant of his
defence. The case cited from Peake's Cases arose
entirely ex delicto. '. There are cases iii which infancy
may be given in evidence upon not guilty. 5 Burr

.flarch 5,
M.ARSHALL,

Ch.

IJ. delivered the dpinion of the

court as follows:
The first error, alleged in this record, cgnsists in
sustaining the plea of infancy to the first count in the
declaration.
This count states a contract between the plaintiff
and defendant, by which the plaintiff committed seventybarrels of flour to the care of the defendant, to be carried, to Norfolk, and there gold for money, or on
sixty days' credit payable'in drafts on Aiexandra, negotiable in the bank. The plaintiff then alleges that
the-defendant did Pot perform his duty in selling conformably to his instructions, but, by his negligence,
permitted the flour to be wasted so that it was lost to
the plaintiff.
This case, as stated, is corripletely- a case of contract, and exhibits no feature of such a tort as will
charge'an infant. Therecan be no doubt-but that the
court did right in sustaining the plea.
The second count is in, trover, and charges a -converz.'on of'the flour.
That-an infant is liable for a conversion is not contested. The circuit court was of itself of that opinion, and therefore sustained the demurrer to this
plea. But, in the progress of the cause, -it appeared

-

FE'BRUARY, 181G..'

"'231

that the goods were not taken wrongfully by- the defiendant, but were ecommitted to his care by the plainff, and that the conversion, if made, was made while
they were in his custody under a contract. The court
then permitted infancy to be given in evidence on the plea
of not guilty. To this opinion an exception was taken.
It infancy, was a bar to a suit of trover brought in
such a case, the court can perceive Tiq reason why it
may not be given in evidence on this plea. If it may
be giv~n in evidence on fon assumpsit, because th"
infant cannot contract, with at least as equal reasoi
may it be given in evidence in an action of trover in
a case in whh~h he cannot convert. But this court is of opinion that infancj is no complete bar to an action of trover, although the goods
converted be in his possession, in virtue of a previous
contract. The conversion is still in its nature a fort ;
it is not an act of omission but of commission, and is
within that class of offences for which infancy annot
afford protection. Yet it mar-be given in evidence,
for it rniay have some influence on the question, whether the act complaihed of be .rejaly a conversion, or
not.
The court, therefore, does not consider the-admisDion of this testimony as error.
The defendant exhibited the letter of instructions
under which he acted, which is in these words: " S i r,"
&c. but the plaintiff offered evidenc that the flour
was not sold in Norfolk, but was shipped by the defendant to the West Indies, for and on account of a certain Joseph Smith, as by the bill of lading which
was produced. The defendant then gave his infancy
in evidence, and prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they believed the testimony, he was not liable
on the second count stated in the plaintiff's declaration, which instruction the court gave, and to thir
opinion an exception was taken.
This instruction of the court must have been found.
ed on the opinion, that infancy is a bar to an action of

trover for goods committed to the infant, under a contract, 'or that, the fact proved did not amount to a Ponversion.
This court has already stated its opinion to be, thit
an infant is chargeable with a conversion, although it
be 'of goods whikh came lawfully to.his possession.
It remains to inquire whether this is so clearly shown
not to be a conyersion, as to juitify the court in saying
to the jury, the di.fendant was not liable in this action.
The pfoof offered was, that the defendant shipped
the goods on account of Joseph Smith. This. fact,
stnding unconnected with any other, would unquestionably be testimony which, if not conclusive in favour of the plaintiff, was, at least, proper to be left
to the jury, But it is urged that this statemeflt reft:rs
to the bill of lading, from the notes in the' margin of
which it appe'ars that, although the bill of lading, which
was ior a much larger quantity of flour, was made"out
in the name of Joseph Smith. yet, in point of fact, the
shipment was made for various persons, and;' among
others, for the plaintiff.
.The court perceive, in this bill of exceptions, no
evidence explanatory of the terms.under which this
shipment was made, and the marks in the margin of
the bill of lading do not, in themselves, prove that-the
shipment was not rade. for the person in vhose name
the bill was filled up.
It is possible that it may have been proved to the
jury that this flour was really'intended to be shipped
on account of the.plaintiff, and that th6 defendant did
not mean to convert it to his own use. But the letter
did .not authorize him so to act. It was not, 'therefore, a complete discharge; and should it be amitted
thtt an infant is not chargeable with a conversion made
bk r istake, this testimony ou~ght ,still to have been
left to the jury. The defendant would certainly be at
liberty to prove that the shipment was in fact made for
Vssse, and that he acquiesced in it so far is to consider
the transaction not as a conversion; but without any of

the action not. sustainable.

This court is of opinion that the circuit court has
erred, in directing the jury that, upon the evidence
given, the defendant .was not liable under the second
count; for which their judgment is to be reversed,
and the cause remanded for further proceedings.*
The Chief Justice noticed also the phraseology of the third hill of
exceptions. It prays the opinion of the court upon certain facts, without stating that any evidence of those facts was given to the jury. - It
is doubtful whether those facts exist in the cgse, and whether the court.
would be bound to give an opinion upon thX.
