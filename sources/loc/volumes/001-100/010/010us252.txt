it is, then, the opinion of a majority of the court
that, if there was really a debt due from the jewelry
store to the haidware store, Finley is entitled to that
debt.
This is a prope" subject. for an account.
The plaintiff has probably not applied fdr this account in the court below, and it does not appeao to be
a princioal object of his bill. This court, thLrefore,
doubited whether it would be most proper to affirm the
-decree dismissing the bill with the addition that it should
be without prejudice to any future claim for profits,
and for the debt due from one store to the other, or to
9pen the decree and direct the account. The latter
was deemed the more equitable course. The decree,
tbtrefore, is-to be reversed, and the cause repand
ed, with directions to take an account -between the
two,stores, and an account -of the profits of the jewelry
store, if the sam shall be required by the plaintiff.
TODD, J. concurred in the opinion of the court that
the debt of Wells ES Co. was a debt to be paid by
Finley, but he differed upon the other part of the case,
being of opinion, that the complainant was 'not entitled.
to a relief which by his bill'he had made a merit of
wvaiving..

Decree reversed, and thecause remanded, witb directions-to reinstate the injundtion, and take an account, &c.
