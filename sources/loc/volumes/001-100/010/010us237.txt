The difference between this act and those, the execution of which is superintended by the court, is apparent. In those cases, the instrument is to be brought
into court, and acted upon by the court: in thi's it is
to be delivered to the clerk at any time, and acted on
by him without the intervention of the court.
This court is unanimously of opinion that the circuit
court for the county of Alexandria could not legalfy entertain the motion for quashing the inquisition found in
this case, nor legally prevent their clerk from recording
it. Their-judgment, therefore, is reversed, and the
motion to be dismissed.
