money from the time their title accrued,
had no notice of their title ; or was in pofeffion under a title, or
fuch a title as he was myraken in ; 6r there has been a default or
lache.r in the plaintiffs, in not afferting there title fooner..
Mr. Duche had all the deeds, and he of courfe knew the title of
Mrs. Haldane ; but he might poffibly have apprehended, that the
deief of his wife was good in law to himfelf : I fay, he poffix
bly was under this mj/ake for a time ; but from his letter of the
12th
d ebruary, 1782, it appears, that he then knew his own title to be bad, and that of the plaintiffs to be good. It further
appeared to the Jury, that Mr. Ducbe not only concealedthe title
of the plaintiffs from them, but mffreprefenlted his own. From
this time, he was not a boner fidei pofeor, and was accountable
to the plaintiffs for the rents, whatever might have been the
cafe prior to this time. A man cannot be an hqneft, faithful poffeffor of what belongs to others; nothing but ignorance of the fa&s.
nd circumftances, relating to his own and his adverfary's titles,
can excufe him inforo cotfcientix. This cannot be pretended here.
"Thus it was fummed up to the Jury, on the trial, and they
found for the plaintiffs accordingly, that is, the amount of the
rents. from February, 1782, 'till March 2, 1796, which I think
was right, and agreeable to equity and the truth of the cafe. If I
erred in the charge to the Jury, it was in limiting them to
February,.1781, and not going back to June, 17 79 r thetime ivhert
Mrs. Halane's title accrued. From this circumftance, the de-.
fendants retain the rents and profits of an eftate, for upwards
of two years and an h1f, to which their Teftator had neither a.
legal nor equitable title. The cafes cited for the plaintiffs, particularly, Bacon's Abr. 18. Prec.- in Chanc. 5 17, and 2 Will,
