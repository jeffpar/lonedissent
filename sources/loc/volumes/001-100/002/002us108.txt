appointed a commiffioner by the Executive Council, to explore
the navigable waters of the Itate ; and on account of his abfence

now moved again, to poflpone the trial. The Attorney General obferved, that the appellant was not in durefs, and might, if

is placing it more advantageoufly than has been hit-orto authorized; and if, as w ha,e fern, a flipulation to reffi, e lands does not
