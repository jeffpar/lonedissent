that it has'been decded that a confeffion, though not made in

of the Chief Juftice Trevor, and the doubts of Juftice Tracy.

The cafe in 5 Bac. muft

have been the cafe of an examination in writing, as it is faid it
might be read in evidence: But Berswick's cafe was a confeffibn
at the time of the fa& ; fo that the former had no. conclufive influence on the latter authority.
It muft, at the fame time, be allowed, that moft of the authorities on this point, feem to lean againft the admiffion of the
pariy's confeffion in the prefence of two witneffes, as fufficient
for cohvi~tion', unlefs it is m-ide at the time of committing the
criminal a&f, or before a Magiftrate duly authorifed. But the
cafe now before us, arifes on a confeffion in open Court, and
though the whole confeffion muft be confidered together ; yet
the Jury may, unqueftionably, on this, as on every other, point of
evidence, believe one part, and difregard another.

to have been fpoken were, -that ", Weedle faid lie had lived fix

and that is was not fo as people took it in this country ; and he
further fLid, the King would become King, and that the xitncfs
thought fo too." There was, however, fome attempt to fhew
thit he was intoxicated at the t:me of fpeaking the offenfive
-words.

Affembly (i P 4 . Dal. Edit. p. 728) and charged all the mif1rifions'of treafon there enumerated. .he words are " That

A6 being-thereof legally eonvided by the evidence of two or more
"1 credible wimefes,
fhall be adjudged guilty ofmifprifion of
I
91 treafon, &c." "
Bradf rd, Attorney Generali having clofed the teftimony for
-the profeution, obferved that the af of Affembly wis couched in general ard comprehenfive terms; and that the words proved to have been fpoken by the defendant were clearly within the:
fenfe and meaning of the words laid in the indi&ment. To,
Ilhew the heinous nature of the offence, he cited Fofl. 200. 20r.
4 BI. C: r1 7 ; and he infifted that drunkennef , in itfelfa -rice,
could not be an excufe for the perpetration of a crime.
*Yeatex, 'for the. defendant, premifed that the law on which
the indi6kment arofe, was new, and could only be juftified by'
the crifis of American affairs at the time of paffing it, wherf it
was neceffary to feal the lips of the.ditaffl&ed. The necefflity
no longer-exifted ; and policy would admit, what legal authoSities required, that, as a penal law, it fhoidld be fri&ly'couftrued. The part of the fedion of the ad 1 to Which the evidnce
applies, is then materially incorre& : For, it is not fence in the
prefent form of -wording and pointing. ; and can only ] renldered intelligible by adding fome words, and. by omitting the feijcolon, and the disjundive c or." By that corredion, it would.

has, in this refpe&, been thought fo harfh by the Legiflature, that
the offence has fince been reduced to ther clafs of mifdemeanors.
But it is the effence of the offence, as well upon general principles, as -upon the pofitive language of the a&' of Affemly,
that the words fhould be fpoken publicly, deliberately, maliciouf-.
lyand advifedly, with a view to perfuade others to refift the
Government. Words of mere heat and paffion will not conftitute the crime alledged ; they are often uttered when the heart
is properly difpofed ; and they muff be conflrued according to
their natural and common import, independent of the paraphrafe
of inuendo;. It is true that the wordg, in the prefent inftance, are
exceptionable ; but they manifeft in themfelves no intentidn, nor
-is there any proof of an intention, to-perfuade others to refift

the Government; they merely exprefs a matter of opinion;
and cannot fairly be converted into matter of treafon. Comb.

ac ofAffembly is inaccurately, and ungrammatically, compofed
but the claufe which has been the fubje of comment, on the
other fide, has always been deemed a fubftantive and independent one. Let that claufe, however, be re6je&ed on account of
its .ip'erfe&ions, 'there fill remains abundant matter to fupport the indi~tment ; for, the words -being proved, are evidence
on another claufe,, that the defendant cc malicioufly and advifedly endeavoured to excite the people to refift the Government of
this Conmmonwealth, and to perfuade them to return to a dependence upon the Crown of GreatBritain."
Again ; it is agreed, that the words fhould be fpoken mali.cioufly and advifedly- ; but ty malice the law only.intends, that
the fpeech be made in an evil and wicked temper of mind ; and
deliberation is fo far effential) that the niere ebullition of 4 tranfientpaffion fhall not be .rigidly conftrued- into defign and criminality.
The Court delivered a charge to the folowing effe :
M'KEAN, G'CkIe Jifice :--.This indi6ment charges all the
â€¢varions a~ls which-conifitute mifprifion of treafn ; and it is
the duty of the Jury to enquire, whether the evidence fupports
pny oxie of the charges., It -is fdd, indeed, that the law on"
which the indictment is founded, is fo' inaccurately penned,
.-hat it cannot be underftood without fupplying.certain material
words i and it is, undoubtedly, true, that although, in.a common
cafe, ,oji a -mere qutttion of property -(as in the bafe of a "Will)
the rule of confttuaion is according to- the fenfe of the inftru-

lite-.Meat; yet, a aw conflituting a- crime, muft be t.ri&ly and rallr

rally interpreted and purfued. The, obfcure paffage in the A&
of Affembly would be rendered perfpicuous and intelligible,
without the addition of any words, by expunging the femicoIon, and the monofyllable " or" : But even that is unneceffary
to fupport the profecution ; fince the words fpoken tended to
excite refiftance to the Government of this Commonwealth, to
perfuade the audience to return to a dependence upon the Crown
of Great Britain, and to favor the enemy; which are diftin&
and fubftantive charges of mifprifion of treafon.
It is proper to add, that the words muft be fpoken with a malicious and mifchievous intention, in order to render them criminal : A mere loofe and idle converfationj without anay wickednefs of heart, may be indifcreet and reprehenfible, but ought
not to be confirued into mifprifion of treafon. On the other
hand, drunkennefs is no juftification, or excufe, for committing
the offence ; to allow it as fuch, would open a door for the
pra~ice of the greateft enormities with impunity.
