The arguments before the Jury on, the trials,, and before the
Court on the fpecial verdi&, Were, in fubftance, as 'follow.
For thzllaintf , A. Le'vy ihfifted, that every fa&, which

cnuld be neceffary to entitle hisWiN1u

CAsEs ruled and adjudged in the

1797. the fpecial verdiS : For, when a veffel has never been heard of,

1oft. 2 Stra. 1199. Parke. 71. 2.
For the defendant, Lewis urged two points: ift. That proof
of a lofs had not been made three months previoufly to the commencement of the prefent a&ion, agreeably to the ftipulation
contained in the policy. 2d. That-the afflured had never abandoned to the underwriters.
'On thefifl pciint he obferved, that the memorandum at the
foot of the policy provided, that " in cafe of a lofs, the money 1hall be paid in three months after proof of the fame"; and
if the underwriter was entitled- to three months for making
payment, after the proof had been exhibited, there was no,
caufe of a&ion at the time this fuit was inftituted. Some previous evidence of the lofs was indifpenfable, by the exprefs agreenent of the parties. The nature of the evidence is not
particularly defined ; but the proteft of the captain, the affidavit
of one of the feameri, or fome other credible atteftation of the
fa&, fhould have beenfurniffied. If a creditor agrees to give
a day for payment, after a certain event takes place, he cannot
fue before that day arrives. In the prefent inftance, it is not
fuffi'cient to make the proof in Court; it fhould be made in,
pais ;,as in the cafe in Palmer x6o, where the ground of a&ion
was a declaration by the defendant, that" after you have prov,ed that I ftruck you, &c. then I do affume to pay you 20."
The plaintiff's letter demanding payment of the underwriters
Vvas dated the ift of Noaember'i 79a2; ahd.the fuit was inftituted the ift of .. anuary 179.3. The obje&ioh muf, therefore,
be fatal to the right of a&ion.
On thefecond point, it was. infifted, that the duty of the affured required him to give notice of the lofs, in a reafonable
time, and to abandon to the underwriter. Parke. 71. 2. i6I.
z Mag. ls. 174. 177. Had this been done, the underwriter would have been enabled to make a diligent and feafonable
enquiry after the veffel ; which may not have been found, beca'ufe ihe has not been properly fought for. Six years- elapfed
between the date .of the policy, and the notice of the lofs. The
'delay is unreafonable ; and, if it does. not entirely defiray all
means of inveftigation, muft certainly encreafe to the underwriter, the uncertainty and difficulty of afcertaining the reality of
the lofs ; while it opens a door to the aflhred for the perpetration of the greateft frauds. It is 'for this reafon, that the law
not only requires an abandonment, in fuch cafes, but the abandonment Ihould be made on the firft opportunity ; and that,
even where there is no hope of recovering any part of the property. It is like the cafe of notice to, the drawer of a Bill
of Exchange when the drawee refufes payment, r .Rep.

In reply, M. Levy obferved, on thefirfl point, that the proof
of the lofs arofe, in legal contemplation, from the faa, that the
veffel had failed, but for an unreafonable length of time had not
been heard of; and ther -fore, *heinfiffed, that it was not neceffary to make the pioof of lofs at the Infurance Oflice, three
months before the right of afiorn accrued. In anfwering the
fecond point, he treated the idda of an abandonment, where no
portion of the property v as faL
ed, as novel, unpreccdeatcd,
and abfurd. The term abandonment has received a fi:ed and
definite fignification ; to whith, it is effen~ial, that fornetbing
fhould be faved, in order that fomething may be abandoned.
Parke. x6i. T. Rep. 613. 4. The real purpofe, for reuiirmg
an abandonment, muft be to transfer to the underwriters
the property and the means of reclaiming and prefterving
it, which muff otherwife continue in the affured. But when
it is demonP-ratively obvious, that the fubje& matter has
utterly ceafed to exift ; that the lofs is total and final ; as
where a fhip has been confumed by fire, or has funk in the ocean ; what can be the ufe, or benefit of an abandonmint ? And
if there can be no ufe, Lex nerninem cogit ad vanafet impoffibilia.
The fallacy of the oppofite argument lies in an application of
the duties, which the law has impofed upon the affured, in the
cafe of one defcription of a total lofs, to a total lofs of an entirely different defcription. The term ",total lofs," in relation
to infurances, is technical ; and includes, as appears from Parke
iio. 6I. two fpecies ; one, where a part of:the property has
been faved, and ftill exiffs ; the other, where the whole property is utterly deftroyed. In the former cafe, abandonment is
neceffary to the fafety of the infurer ; it is the title, withoutwhich he cannot reclaim the rejiduum, nor exercife thofe a&s of
ownerfhip, that are effential to reduce it to polfhffion. But in
-the latter cafe, no fuch purpofe can be contemplated, or attained ; and the common fenfe of mankind would be fartled at the
idea, that it was neceiffary to give up to another, the ownerfhip
of a thing not in being ; of a thing which bad been completely
annihilated. To require this ufelefs and abfurd a&, from the
affured, under the heavy penalty of forfeiting his infurance,
would be wantonly oppreflive and unjuft. The analogy, fated
by the oppofite counfd, between notice of abandonment, and
1otice of a protefted b;ll of exchange, is admitted and adopted:
bar,; t mufr be recQlleCed, that the holder of the bill negle&ing to give notice, only'lofes his recourfe upon the drawer, in
cafe the d.awee had effeds in his hands; .for, if the drawee
had no effels, there need not be notice given of the rcfufal to
accept, or pay. and the holder fhall not lore his dbt for omit-

CAsEs ruled and adjudged in the

1797. ting to give a notice, which could be of io ufe to the drawer.
X T. Rep. 410. The principle and authority of the cafes are
the fame. If any thing exifts, that can be abandoned, the
infurer ought to have notice ; but if a notice can be of no ufe
to him; there can be no reafon why he fhould receive it, any
xnore than the drawer of a bill of exchange, who has no effe&s
in the hands of the drawee. It is true, that it would be expe,dient, on the part of the affured, to give notice and abandon,

under any circumftances-of lofs ; becaufe then, if any portion
of the property iafured was faved from the general wreck, he
would have a complete right to an indemnity ; which he would
not have, ihould a part Of the property be faved, and he has negle&ed that precaution.

The omiffion, however, is at the peril "

of the affured ;. and the rifques to which the omiffion expofeshim, will always be a fufficient guard "againft fraud. Every
prudent man will give the notice: No defignine man will ne-lecb
it, left it fhould fruifrate his purpofe. Thofe who omit it will,
therefore, gfnerally,. be of that defcription of men, from whom
little is to be feared ; and the omiffion will be the mere effe&iS
of inadvertancy, or ignorance. But, although prudence recommends the pra&ice, the law does not enjoin it. 1f, indeed,
it is made effential, that notice, which was intended only for a
ihield againft the affured, will be converted into a Â£word, in the
hands of the underwriter; and a Court of Juftice muff condemn the-owner-of a veffel and cargo to fuftain the lofs, againft
which he meant to fecure himfelf, merely for omitting a form,
which, if complied with, could not have produced the flighteft
advantage to the underwriter. The penalty is fuxely difproportioned to the tranfgrefion.
On the firf trial, THE COURT, in the charge to the Jury,
expreffed a wifli, that the plaintiff had given earlier notice of the
]ofs to the underwriters; as it would have rebutted every
fufpicion of unfair and collufive condu&. " It was enough,
however, (the CHIEF JUSTI ,Eobferved) that no fa&k pf that kind
had been proved, nor, indeed, alledged; fince fraud is never to
be prefumed. The defendant's counfel has urged, that, before
-the affured can recover for a total loft, there mull be an exprefs
and feafonable abandonment. But by the word "abandonment,"
I underftand a yielding, ceding, or giving up; and, in general,
it applies to cafes, where there has been a great lofs,'and the
affured, reforting to the policy for an indemnity, furrenders
wvhatever, is left of the property infured 'to the underwriters.
-We cannot, however, conceive,'that when there is nothing left
to give up, there can be any thing to abandon ; and if there is
nothing to abandon, it would be abfurd, as well as ufelefs, to
â¢infift upon a formal a6 of abandonment. Under all thefe circumftances of the cafe, theiefore, we think that the plaintiff is
entitled

commence at the expiration of three months after the demand
for payment."
Verdi& for the Plaintiff.*

After the fecond trial, and argument on the fpecial verdi ,
CouRT feemed to be of opinion, "that the plaintiff could
not recover ; becaufe, he had not made -proofof the lofs, according to the ternis of the policy, three months previoufly to the
commencement of the affion." No opinion was then, however,
expreffed on the fecond objeffion made by the defendant's counfel ; but THi COURT alked, whether he would wave the objection to the time of commencing the action, that the caufe might
-he decided on its merits ?. And he refufed to comply.

Cur. ,4dv. FtÂ¢i.
The jury,,after being out fome time, returned to the Bar, and
declared they could not agree, on account of the lapfe of tihe, and
expreffed a defife to examine Mr. Kaighn (who had effea6ed the infi,!
rance as agent) relative to the cbaraaer and condu& of the plaintifr.
It thereupofi appeared, that the witnefs had not heard from the plaintiff from 1786 till 1792, -when he defired that 'he policy might be.
given to Mr. Role to be recovered ; and that, fometime before, in a
converfation with the witnefs's partner, the plaintiff had faid, as a
reafon fbr not applying to the underwriters, 41that he mull obtain the
captain's protelt and vouchers of the lofs, before h8 could recover on
the policy." It, alfo, appeared, that the plaintiff was a man of irreproachable character. The Jury, having received this further fatiefaction, Loon delivered a verdict for the plaintiT..
