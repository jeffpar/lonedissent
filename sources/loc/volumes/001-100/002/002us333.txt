But, for the defendant,,it was contended, that the notice of r795.
the rule fhould have been given to the party, and not to his at- A.0_VyJ
torney. In Rivers v. Waller, I Dall. Rep. 8 1. notice, in the
cafe of referees, is direced to be given to the party ; and the
reafon is ftronger in the prefent inftance, as the defendant lives
at a great diftance, and the attorney ought not to be put to the
trouble and expence oi tranfmitting the notice. Befides, there
is no certificate produced that the deeds are not on record ; and
the fa& is that they are recorded ; fo that the plairitiff might,
ai any time, procure exemplifications.
BY THE COURT :-The provifion contained in the judicial
al was intended to prevent the neceflity of inftituting fuits in
Equity, merely to -obtain from an adverfe party, the produ&ion
of deeds and papers relative to the litigated iffue. The a&t
fays, generally, that the Court thall have power, " on motion
and due notice thereof being given, to require the parties to
produce books or writings, &c." without defignating to whom
the notice ffall be given, the party himfelf, or his attorney.
But we will always keep the caufe under our controul for the
purpofes of fubftantial juftice, and never fufTer either party to
be entrapped. If, for inftance, notice is ferved on an attorney,
whofe client lives at a great diftance, this will always be deemed a fuficient reafon to poftpone the trial, 'till a full opportfnity
has been afforded for the attorney's communicating the rule to
the client. If, likewife, the Court find that the deeds are actually on record, we will not indulge the party with a rule for
producing them, merely as a cheap mode of pr"curing evidence.
The originals may fometimes, indeed, be neceffary, for a fpecial realon, detached from the evidence ; 'but, in that cafe, the
1pecial reafon muftbe. aligned to the Court.
The defendant's counfel offering to refer their .pponents to
the pages, &c. where the deeds in queftion are recorded, THE
COURT declared that.this put an end to the matter ; but added,
that if it was not fatisfa~lorily done, they would not allow the
caufe to be brought to trial.
