The GUARDIANS of the Poor of5

Philadedphia.

HIS was a motion for a mandarmus, commanding the de.,

fendants to proceed to another eletion of the managers4
of the Houfe of Employment. By the a& of Affembly, paf-.
fed the aSth .of March 1782 (2 Vol. Dall. Edit. p. 17.) it
was declared, that " thb Guardians of the Poor in the City of

cc Pbiladbhiafhall half-yearly appoint fix of their number, to
cc fuperintend the Alms-HouTe and Houfe of Employment ;"

and it was agreed, in point of fa&, that the Guardians of the
Poor had uniformly made the half-yearly appointments ; but,
with a view to enfure the benefit of experience, they had always taken care to keep three of the fix old managers in office,
'till the laft ele&ion, when fix managers entirely new were- appointed.
Bradfortd and "ngerfoll,in fupport of the motion, contended,
that the ufage of re-appointing three of the old managers, was
beneficial, and oilght to be confidered-as the genuine connfruc
tion of the law.
. Rawie, in oppofing the motion, -admitted the ufage, but infifted, that, on the terms of the a& of Affembly, the defendants
were authorifed to appoint fix-new members at every half-yearelelion.
THE COURT, after advifement, reje&ed the motion
