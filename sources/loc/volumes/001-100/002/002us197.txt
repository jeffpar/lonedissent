defendant, upon the principle that no man Ihall be allowed to

HABEAS CORPUS was iffued to bring up the body
Aof
Behjamin, a minor, about fourteen years old,
who had been bound by his guardian's confent, to the defendant, to ferve her till he fhould arrive to the age of fifteen.
Having abfconded from her fervice, he was committed to goal,
for that caufe ; and a general queftion was made, whether an
infant could be bound as a fetvant in Pennfylvania ?
THE COURT were unanimouly of opinion, that the indentdre, in this cafe, was void, and gave their opinions feriatim.
The opinion of 7tiflice BRADFORD, (which is all I have 'in.
my notes) entered fully into the principles of the decifion as

CASES riled and adjudged in the

BRADFORD. 7ufice : -The imprifonment of this infant, if
juftified at all, muft be fupported under theA& of 17oo, refpe6ting fervants ; fo that the only queftion for our determination is,
whether he be a fervant within the meaning of that a& of Affembly ? i Vol. Dall. Edit. p. r3.
It is clear that this indenture, by which the infant is bound to
five, and not to learn any trade, occupation, or labour, cannot be fupported upon the principles of common law, nor by
the exprels words of any flatute. But, it is faid, that it depends upon the czrom of the country.;,and it is evident that fuch
a cuftom is referred to in our laws. I have taken rome pains to
afcertain its origin and extent.
This cuftom feems to have originated with the firft advent.
turers to Virginia, and to have arifen from the circumftances of
the country. Perfons defiroui of coming to Anerica, and unable to pay for their paflage in any other way, fhipped themfelves
and their children, as fervants. If they wzre imported under
indenture, thofe indentures were held good, affd they were to
ferve according to their itipulation; but if there was no in*denture, they were to ferve according to the cuftom, to wit, five
years, if of full age, or above feventeen ; and if under feventeen,
'till they arrived at the age of twenty-two, or in fome places
'till twenty-four. The early laws of Virginia and Mkfaryland
(fome of them fo early as 1638) fpeak of thefe fervants thus imported: they are called, cc fervants according to the cuftom ;"
4" fervants bound to ferve the accuftomary five years ;" and
fometimes are "defcribed as "9 fervants fold for the cuftom."
Thefe fervants were in'a very degraded fituation. They were
a fpecies of property,, holding a middle rank between flaves and
freemen ; they might be fold from hand to hand ; and they were
under the-corre&ion of laws exceedingly fevere.
It appears by all the early laws on this fubjea, that the cuftom extended to inportedfervants only; and it extended to all
fuch as were imported, whether minors, or adults. The cuftom was founded on neceffity ; and it was thought to be mutually beneficial to.the colony, and to the emigrant. But no fuch
neccffity exifted as to the children who were alrGady in the province. The cuftom, therefore, never extended to them ; and
there was in all the colonies, and particularly in Pennfylvania,
a marked diftinaion between thefe two claffes of minors. This
is to be found iih the articles of the laws agreed-on in England,
and more fully in the. laws of 1632. Theif fpeak only of imported fervants; and dire& how long fuch fervanpts, brought
into the province without indentures, fhall'ferve ; but, in Chap.
X12, all parents and guardians in the province are enjoined to
teach the children under their care to read and write, 'till they
are twelve years old, and that.then they be infirt~lced in fome ufeful

?rade arAkill. This policy of putting children out as apprentices, 1793.
is carried into our poor laws, and ihofe which relate to orphans. ,' v
Overfeers of the poor, and the Orphans Courts, have no authority to bind out minors as fervants, even fuch as are the obje&s of public charity. They muft be bound apprentices to
fome " art, trade, occupation, or labour."
There have been infrances of children here being bound out
as fervants ; but this has not been general ; and the Courts of
Juftice have always frowned on the attempts.
I agree, that it is not neceffary to determine how far a Lather may transfer to another, the right which he has to the fervice of his children, in confideration of that other's inftruaing
him in reading, writing, and the li:e ; nor whether the Court
would interfere to take the child out of fuch perfon's cufLody.
But, I think it right to fay, that no parent, under any circumftances, can make his child a firvant, in the fenfe in which this
boy is held as fuch. Though he is intitled to the fervice of his
child, he cannot enforce it, as a mailer can that of his ferrants; he cannot commit him to goal if he runs away ; he
cannot demand the penalty of five days fervice for every day of
abfence ; and, terefore, it is impoffible that he can transfer
fuch right to another.
I am, therefore, of opinion with the reft of the Court, that
this boy is not a fervant within the meaning of the A&t of 1o7a
and confequently, he muff be difcharged.
