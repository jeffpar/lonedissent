HIS cafe now came before the Court, on a petition, that
the appeal fhould be fuftained: but GRxF iN, READ, and

LOWELL, Commiflioners, rejeted the application in the fol-

lowing terms.
BY THE COURT. In this cafe, the judgment of the Court
will be determined by the conftrufion of the refolutioft of Congrefo, of June, 1786.
Congrefs having eftablifhbed a fytem of appeals, and in that fyftern having limited a period, beyond which appeals are not to
be entered, we think the refolution of 7une, 1786, could only
mean, that, in conformity with this prior eftablifhment, the
judges might ufe a difcretionary power, where particular circumfances, confiftent with juftice and right, may in their opinion require it.
*Whatever decree the Court might have made upon the vierits of the caufe, and although the property may have been illegally condemned in the maritime Courts; yet under all the circumfances of the prefent cafe, we are unanimoufly of opinion,
,that juftice and right do not require, that the appeal Thould
now be fuftained.

Court of Admiralty, in the State of South Carolina, condemning
