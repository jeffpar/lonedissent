DOUBLEBOWER.

T' HiS was an appeal from the decifion of aJuftice of the
Peace in an aion oftrefpafs, brought before him againft a Conftable, for wronrIilly taking the goods of the plaintiff; and in which judgment had been given forC"
9 . 18.
Roberit, for the plaintiff, and Bradftrd, for the defendant,
fubmitted the cafe to the Court, without argument, upon this
fingle queftion, whether a Juficet of the Peace has jurifdi&ion
in adions of trefpafs, fortaking goods ?
SHiPPEN, Prefdent :-Aions of .Trover; are exprefsly e.xcepted from the jurifdifion of Jutices of the Peace ; and this"
being fuch a trefpafs, as might be made the foundation of an action of Trover, is fairly within the reafon of the Legiflative exception. The powers of ;he Juftices of the Peace are, perhaps,
already fufficiently grat ; -but, -it all events, it would be highly
dangerous to extend them to cafe like the prefent.
