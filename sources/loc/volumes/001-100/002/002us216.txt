gsEs ruled and adjudged in the

du&1 of the garnifhee himfelf, fuch cafes will form exceptions
to the general rule. In the prefent inftance, however, there is
no proof of fraud, or collufion.; nor of any wilful procraftination on the part of the gainifhee ; and fraud can never be
.prefumed. It 'is true, likewife, that no exprefs authority was
given. for laying the attachmrnts ; but an implied authority appears in the correfpondence that has been produced: And the
defendant is not anfwerable for :the event. Iam, therefore, of
opinion that. intereft ought not to be allowed.
SHiPPEN, Jutice. Evidence *ill often ftrikd6different minds
in a different maine'r. It does not appear to me, that there was
fufficient authority for inffituting the foreign attachment; but,
on the contrary, that it 'Was done officioufly, and at the inftance
of the garnifhee himfelf. I fhould, confequently, think itjuft,
on this occafion, to allow the claim of intereft ; but the majority of the Court will fan6tion a different decifion.
YEAras, yujqice. I concur, generally, in the opinion expreffed by the Chicd"Juftice, that there is not fufficient ground
to except the prefent cafe from the operation of,the general
rule.
BkADFORD, 7u/tice. As I was originally Counfel in this
caufe, I forbear taking any part in the decifion.
By THE COURT :-It is-awarded, that the defendant be difcharged, upon payment of the principal funr recovered, with
colts.*
