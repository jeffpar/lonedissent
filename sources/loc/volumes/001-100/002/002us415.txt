ILL N EQuITxY. This caufe was again brought before
the COurt, upona motion by Randolph, to diffolve the injundion, which had been iffued, and to difmifs the Bill.
He
affigned two grounds in fupport of his motion :-if/. That the
State of Georgia had no remedy at law to recover the Debt in
queftion; and "znd. That even if there was a remedy at law
there was no equitable right to juftify the prefent form of pro.
ceeding. The motion was oppofed by ingerfoll and Dallas;
and after argument, the opinions of the judges (in the abfenco
of JoHNsox, juflice,) were delivered as follows.
IREDELL, JuJVice. It is my misfortune to diflrit from thG
opinion entertained by the reft of the court upon the prefent
occafion; but I am boundto decide, according to the di&ates.
of my own judgment.
The State of Georgia complains, that having a right to the.
dcbt in queftion, that right has been difcuffed and over-ruled
without giving her an opportunity to be heard in fupport of it,
though fhe applied to the Circuit Court for that purpofe. It is
another grievance alledged, that a Writ of Error has not been

inflituted.
