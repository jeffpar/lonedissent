was an a6tion brought to recover the amount of a
T.bond, in favor of the Teltatrix, which the Executor had
received. The plaintiff claimed it as a legacy, under the following words in the will : " Item, I give and bequeath'unto Mary
c Ja ckfon, wife of Milliam 7ackfon, all my wearing apparel,
-cchoufehold furniture, plate, linen, books, and every nzoveable
cc zvha foever." The Teftatrix then proceeds to give a variety
of legacies in caih, and bequeaths the reft and refidue of the
eftate to Samuel;_Robifon, and others. Her perfonal eftate was
about ,CZooo, principally out at intexeft ; but (he had no real
eftate.

enough to cover the debts due to the Teftatrix. He referred to

meaning of the Teftatrix is plain enough.. If the plaintiff's
conftru&ion were right, all the reft of the will would be deftroyed. In this cafe, moveables muft be confined to things of
the fame nature with thofe.before fpecified. Let there be a
verdift for the defendant, with liberty for the plaintiff to move
for a new trial, if, on coufideration, he think his pofition tenable.
