TRENOUTH v. SAN FRANCISCO.

TRENOUTH v. SAN FRANCISCO.
1. The history of the title of San Francisco to her municipal lands stated.
2. The act entitled "An Act to quiet the title to certain lands within the corporate limits of the city of San Franciscb," approved March 8, 1866 (14 Stat.
4), confirmed her claim, in trust that certain lands should be disposed of
and conveyed to parties in the bona fide actual possession thereof, by themselves or tenants, on the passage of the act. Hed, that trespassers then in
posession of the lands, who were afterwards ejected therefrom at the suit
of those upon whose prior possession they had intruded, are not beneficiaries under the act; but that the parties who so recovered the possession
are entitled to a conveyance from the city.
3. A party cannot initiate a pre-emption right to public land by intrusion upon
the actual possession of another; nor by settling upon land in California,
a claim to which, under a foreign title, is at the time pending before the
tribunals of the United States for confirmation.

EnRoR to the Supreme Court of the State of California.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. Walter Van .Dyke for the plaintiff in error.

Mr. S. 31. Wilson, Mr. Edward eTanin, and Mr. Edmond L.
Goold, contra.
IR. JUSTICE FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.
This was a suit to charge the defendants as trustees of certain land in the city of San Francisco, and to compel a conveyance of the legal title to the plaintiff. The case is free from
difficulty, but to understand the positions of the plaintiff it
will be necessary to state briefly the history of the titles to
lands in tlat city.
At the time of the conquest of California by the forces of
the United States, on the 7th of July, 1846, there was a Mexiban pueblo at the site of the present city of San Francisco.
This term "pueblo," in its original signification, means people
or population, but is used in the sense of the English word
"town." It has the indefiniteness of that term, and, like
it, is sometimes applied to a mere collection of individuals
residing at a particular place, a settlement or village, as well
as to a regularly organized municipality. Grisar v. MJeDowell, 6 Wall. 363. The pueblo at San Francisco was a small
settlement, but it vas of sufficient importance, as early as

TRENOUTH V. SAN FRANCISCO.

[Sup. Ct.

1835, to have an ayuntamiento, composed of alcaldes and
other officers; and it was under their government for some
years. At the time of the conquest, and for some time afterwards, it was under the government of justices of the peace,
or alcaldes.
By th laws of ,lexico, in force in California on the acquisition of the country, pueblos or towns, when once recognized
by public authority, became entitled, for their benefit and that
of their inhabitants, to the use of the lands embracing the site
of such pueblos or towns and adjoining territory within the
limits of four square leagues, to be measured and assigned to
them by the officers of the government. Under those laws the
pueblo of San Francisco asserted a claim to four square leagues,
to be measured off from the northern portion of the peninsula
upon which the present city is situated.
The alcaldes of a pueblo exercised the power of distributing
the lands of the town in small parcels to its inhabitants for
building, cultivation, or other uses, the remainder being gen
erally retained for commons or other public purposes.
When the town of San Francisco was occupied by our forces,
citizens of the United States were appointed by the military
or the naval commanders to act as alcaldes in the place of the
Mexican officers. Upon the sudden increase of population at
that place, following the discovery of gold, the alcaldes were
called upon for building-lots in great numbers, and those officers distributed them with a generous liberality usually attending the grant of other people's propetty. Numerous persons,
however, arriving at the town were not disposed to recognize
the authority in this respect of the American magistrates, and
finding it less troublesome to appropriate what land they
needed than to apply to the magistrates for it, they asserted
that the land on which the pueblo was situated belonged to the
United States, and, as evidence of the sincerity of their convictions, immediately proceeded to take as much of it for
themselves as they could conveniently enclose and hold. Thus
the town was soon filled with an active and restless population,
making large and expensive improvements upon lands held in
some instances under grants from the alcaldes, and in others
by the right of prior possession. Sometimes the same parcel

was claimed by different parties; by one party as a settler,
and by another as the holder of an alcalde grant. Disputes
both in and out of the courts, the natural consequence of this
difference in the origin of the titles of the claimants, were
greatly increased in bitterness by the enormous value which in
a short period the lands acquired.
In April, 1850,;soon after the organization of the State governmenf, San Francisco was incorporated as a city by the legislature. She at once made claim to the lands of the pueblo,
as its successor; and, when the board of land commissioners
was created under the act of Congress of March ., 1851, she
presented the claim for confirmation. In December, 1854, the
board confirmed the claim for only a portion of the four square
leagues. Dissatisfied with the limitation of the claim, the city
appealed from the decree of the commissioners to the District
Court of the United States. The government also appealed,
though subsequently it withdrew its appeal. The case remained in the District Court undetermined until September,
1864, a period of nearly ten years, when, under the authority of an act of Congress, that court transferred the case to
the Circuit Court, where it was decided in the following October. The decree, finally settled and entered May 18, 1865,
confirmed the claim to a tract of land embracing so much
of the upper portion of the peninsula upon which the city
is situated, above the ordinary high-water mark of 1846,
as would contain an area of four square leagues,-t he tract
being bounded on the north and east by the bay of San
Francisco, on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and on the south
by a due east and west line, drawn so as to include the area designated, subject to certain deductions, which it is unnecessary
to mention here. The lands were confirmed to San Francisco
in trust for the benefit of lot-holders under grants from the
pueblo, town, or city, or other competent authority, and as to
any residue, in trust for the use and benefit of the inhabitants
of the city. As already stated, the city was incorporated in
April, 1850. The charter she then received was repealed, and
a new charter granted in'April, 1851. The limits of the city,
as defined by this latter charter, embraced an area of over two
miles square. The lhnds lying outride of these charter limits

[Sup. Ct.

are designated in the subsequent legislation of the city and
State, and frequently in the decisions of the courts, as outside
lands.
Pending the appeal of the pueblo claim in the District Court,
the city passed an ordinance, known in its history, from the name
of its author, as the Van Ness Ordinance, the object of which
was to settle and quiet the title of persons holding land in the
city. It relinquished and granted all the right and claim of the
city to land within the corporate limits as defined by the charter of 1851, with certain exceptions, to parties in the actual
possession thereof, by themselves or tenants, on or before the
1st of January, 1855, provided such possession was continued
up to the time of the introduction of the ordinance into the com
mon council, or if interrupted by an intruder or trespasser, had
been or might be recovered by legal process; and it declared
that, for all the purposes contemplated by the ordinance, persons should be deemed possessors who held titles to lands within
those limits by virtue of a grant made by'any hyuntamiento,
town council, alcalde, or justice of the peace of the former
pueblo, before the 7th of July, 1846, or by virtue of a grant
subsequently made by those authorities, within certain limits of
the city, previous to its incorporation by the State, provided the
grant, or a material portion of it, had been recorded in a proper
book of records in the control of the recorder of the county
previous to April83, 1851. In March, 1858, the legislature
ratified and confirmed this ordinance; and on the 1st of July,
1864, Congress relinquished and granted to the city all the interest of the United States to the lands within the corporate
limits of 1851, in trust for the uses and purposes of the ordinance. Thus the contention of the different claimants to land
within those limits was settled, their titles secured, and the
usual result of quieting titles, progress and prosperity, followed.
But appeals were prosecuted to the Supreme Court, both by
the United States and by the city, - by the United States from
the whole decree, and by the city from so much of it as included the reservations in the estimate of the quantity of land
confirmed. Whilst these appeals were pending, and on the
8th of March, 1866, Congress passed an act to quiet the title to

certain lands within the corporate limits of the city. At this
time, the limits had been extended so as to be coincident with
those of the county, and embraced the whole of the four square
leagues confirmed. By this act, all the right and title of the
United States to the land covered by the decree of the Circuit
Court were relinquished and granted to the city, and the claim
to the land was confirmed; subject, however, to certain reservations and exceptions, and upon trust that all the land not
previously granted to the city should be disposed of and conveyed by the city to the parties in the bona fide actual possession thereof, by themselves or tenants, on the passage of the
act, in such quantities and upon such terms and conditions as
the legislature of the State of California might prescribe, except such parcels thereof as might be reserved and set apart by
ordinance of the city for public uses. The appeals to the
Supreme Court were accordingly dismissed.
Townsend v.
Greeley, 5 Wall. 326. The title of the city to the land within
the four square leagues rests, therefore, upon the decree of the
Circuit Court, as entered on the 18th of May, 1865, and this
confirmatory act of Congress. By this act, the government
expressed its will with respect to the claim of the city, and the
conditions upon which it should be recognized and confirmed.
As was said by this court, in Grisarv. MeDowell, "in the execution of its treaty obligations with respect to property claimed
under Mexican laws, the government may adopt such modes of
procedure as it may deem expedient. It may act by legislation directly upon the claims preferred, or it may provide a
special board for their determination, or it -may require their
submission to the ordinary tribunals. It is the sole judge of
the propriety of the mode; and, having the plenary power of
confirmation, it may annex any conditions to the confirmation
of a claim resting upon an imperfect right which it may
choose. It may declare the action of the special board final;
it may make it subject to appeal; it may require the appeal to
go through one or more courts; and it may arrest the action of
board or courts at any stage. 6 Wall. 879.
The title of the city being thus settled, its authorities proceeded under the provisions of the confirmatory act, and reserved and set apart grounds for parks and other public

But, as these grounds were in many instances

occupied, the city passed an ordinance known as No. 800, subsequently ratified by the legislature, by which a general assessment was levied upon all the lands conveyed to occupants as a
condition of receiving deeds from the city, the money thus
raised to be applied towards compensating those whose lands
were thus taken for public purposes.
Some of the defendants, and parties through whom the
others claim, had been in the actual possession of the land in
controversy here before the passage of the act of 1866 ; but their
possession had been intruded upon by violence, and they driven
from the land by parties through whom the plaintiff claims.
One of the intruding parties afterwards set up a claim that he
entered as a pre-emptioner under the laws of the United States.
Subsequently, the excluded parties recovered possession by
suit; and the judgment in their favor was affirmed on appeal
by the Supreme Court of the State. They then transferred the
property, for the sake of convenience and expedition in securing the title, to one of their number, who applied to the city
authorities and obtained a deed of the premises, first paying the
assessment levied upon it and the taxes due. Under this deed
the defendants hold the property. The plaintiff, representing
the claims of the intruding and subsequently ejected parties,
and insisting that they were beneficiaries under the act of Congress, because upon its passage they were in the actual possession of the property, brought the present suit to charge the
defendants as trustees of the legal title for his benefit. The
District Court and the Supreme Court of the State were of
opinion that, upon his own showing, his grantors, the intruders mentioned, were never in the bona fide possession of
the property, within the meaning of the act of Congress; and
we agree with them in this respect. The claim of one of the
intruders as a pre-emptioner was equally unfounded, - 1st, because the right of pre-emption, under the laws of the United
States, cannot be acquired by intrusion and trespass upon lands
in the actual possession of others; 2d, because the lands were
claimed under a foreign title, - that of the pueblo from
Mexico, - the claim to which -was then pending before the
tribunals of the United States.

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

The possession obtained by the intrusion and trespass of the
plaintiff's grantors constitutes no ground for equitable relief
against the holders of the city title; and the assertion of a
possession thus obtained has as little merit as the lawless and
unjustifiable conduct of the intruders in seizing the property.
Judgment affirmed.

TENNxESSEE v. DAvis.
1. Sect. 6M. of the Revised Statutes of the United States, which declares that
"when any civil suit or criminal prosecution is commenced in any court of
a State against any officer appointed under or acting by authority of any
revenue law of the United States now or hereafter enacted, or against
any person acting under or by authority of any such officer, on account of
any act done under color of his office or of any such law, or on account
of any right, title, or authority claimed by such officer or other person under
any such law, . . . the said suit or prosecution may, at any time before the
trial or final hearing thereof, be removed for trial into the Circuit Court
next to be holden in the district where the same is pending, upon the peti.
tion of such defendant to said Circuit Court," &c., is not in conffict with the
Constitution of the United States.

authority of the internal-revenue laws of the United States; that what he
did was done under and by right of his said office; that it was his duty
