Dow had good reasons for all he did, and I think he would
have acted more wisely if, respecting the courts in the proper
exercise of their functions, he had made his defence at the right
time before the appropriate tribunal.

SAVINGS BANK V. WARD.
A., an attorney-at-law, employed and paid solely by B. to examine and report
on the title of the latter to a certain lot of ground, gave over his signature
this certificate, "B.'s title to the lot" (describing it) "is good, and the property
is unineumbered." C., with whom A. had no contract or communication,
relied upon this certificate as true, and loaned money to B., upon the latter
executing by way of security therefor a deed of trust for the lot. B., before
employing A., had transferred the lot in fee by a duly recorded conveyance,
a fact which A., on examining the records, could have ascertained, had lie
exercised a reasonable degree of care. The money loaned was not paid, and
B. is insolvent. Hdd, 1. That there being neither fraud, collusion, or falsehood
by A., nor privity of contract between him and C., he is not liable to the
latter for any loss sustained by reason of the certificate. 2. That usage cannot make a contract where none was made by the parties.

MR. JUSTIOE CLiFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Attorneys employed by the purchasers of real property to
investigate the title of the grantor prior to the purchase impliedly contract to exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of the undertaking, and if they are negligent, or fail
to exercise such reasonable care and skill in the discharge of
the stipulated service, they are responsible to their employers
for the loss occasioned by such neglect or want of care and skill.
Addison, Contr. (6th ed.) 400.
Like care and skill are also required of attorneys when employed to investigate titles to real estate to ascertain whether
it is a safe or sufficient security for a loan of money, the rule

SAVINGS BANK V. WARD.

[Sup. Ct.

being that if the attorney is negligent or fails to exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of the service, and a
loss results to his employers from such neglect or want of care
and skill, he shall be responsible to them for the consequences
of such loss. Addison, Torts (Wood's ed.), 615.
Pursuant to that rule of law the plaintiffs sued the defendant,
and alleged as the cause of action that they retained and employed him to examine and ascertain the title of the possessor
of certain premises situate in the city of Washington and
described in the declaration, and to report to them the nature
and extent of his title to the same; and they allege that he,
the defendant, accepted the employment, and reported to then
that the title of the possessor of the premises was good and
unincumbered.
Their theory as alleged in the declaration is that they procured that report with a view to the making of a loan, and
they allege that upon the faith and credit of it they loaned the
sum of 83,500 to the pretended owner of the premises, and
accepted as security for the same a trust-deed of 'the property,
whereas the borrower of the money was insolvent and had no
title whatever to the premises, as fully and explicitly appears
'by a prior deed of conveyance duly recorded.
Process was duly served, and the defendant appeared and
pleaded the general issue, which was duly joined by the plaintiffs. Continuance followed, and at the opening of the next
term the parties went to trial, and the verdict and judgment
were in favor of the defendant. Exceptions were filed by the
plaintiffs, and they sued out the present writ of error.
Six errors are assigned in this court, of which three will be
separately examined. They are as follows: 1. That the court
erred in ruling that some privity of contract, arising from an
actual employment of the defendant by the plaintiffs, is necessary to enable the latter to maintain the action. 2. That the
court erred in holding that the evidence- introduced did not
establish such a privity of contract between the parties as
entitled the plaintiffs to recover. 3. That the court erred in
instructing the jury that upon the whole evidence the verdict
should be for the defendant.
Evidence was introduced by the plaintiffs tending to prove

Oct. 1879.1

SAVINGS BANK V. WARD.

that the defendant is an attorney-at-law doing business in the
city, and that he held himself out to the public as a person
skilled in the examination of titles to real estate situated in the
District of Columbia. That the claimant of the lot describedin the transcript employed the defendant, in his professional
character, to examine his title to that lot, and to report to him
the condition of the same, and that the defendant, pursuant to
that employment, reported to his employer that his title to the
lot is good and that the property is unincumbered, the report
being signed by the defendant and his son.
It is not pretended by the plaintiffs that they ever employed
.the defendant to examine the title to the lot, and it appears
that the report was made at the sole request of the claimant of
the lot, without any knowledge on the part of the defendant as
to the purpose for which it was obtained. All that is conceded by the plaintiffs; but they gave evidence to show that
the claimant of the lot presented the certificate to certain
brokers, and employed them to nerotiate a loan upon the property in his favor for e3,500, on the faith of that certificate.
Detailed statement is given in the transcript of the steps takefi
by the brokers to obtain the required loan, the substance of
which is that they required the party to give a negotiable note
for the amount, payable in one year, with ten per cent interest,
and that he and his wife shpuld execute a trust-deed of the lot
to them as trustees to secure the payment of the note when
due.
Preliminaries being arranged, the brokers applied to the
plaintiffs for the loan and obtained the same, giving the note
and deed of trust with the certificate as security for the payment. Before accepting the papers, the plaintiffs, through their
agent, required the brokers to sigm the name of the borrower
to the formal application for the loan, as exhibited in the transcript, and that the certificate as to the title should be continued
to the date of the transaction.
Throughout, the negotiation for the loan was conducted entirely by the brokers with the plaintiffs, and it was the borrower who procured the second certificate from the defendant,
the evidence showing that the defendant never came in contact
either with the plaintiffs or the brokers.

[Sup. Ct.

Payment of the note was not made at maturity, and when it
was attempted to sell the premises under the trust-deed, it was
discovered that the certificates were untrue, and that the grantors, on the 13th of March previous, had conveyed the premises
in fee-simple, by deed duly executed and recorded.
Attorneys-at-law are officers of the court, admitted as such
by its order; but it is a mistake to suppose that they are officers
of the United States, as they are neither elected nor appointed
in the manner prescribed by the Constitution for the election or
appointment of such officers. .Exarte Garland,4 Wall. 333,
378.
When a person adopts the legal profession, and assumes to
exercise its duties in behalf of another for hire, he must be
understood as promising to employ a reasonable degree of care
and skill in the performance of such duties; and if injury results to the client from a want of such a degree of reasonable
care and skill, the attorney may be held to respond in damages
to the extent of the injury sustained. Proof of employment
and the want of reasonable care and skill are prerequisites to
the maintenance of the action; but it must not be understood
that an attorney is liable for every mistake that may occur in
practice, or that he may be held responsible to his client for
every error of judgment in the conduct of his client's cause.
Instead of that, the rule is that if he acts with a proper degree
of skill, and with reasonable care and to the best of his knowledge, he will not be held responsible. Bowman v. Tallnzan,
27 How. (N. Y.) Pr. 212, 274.
If he fails in any of these respects he may, and sometimes
does, not only forfeit all claim for compensation, but may also
render himself liable to his client for any damage he may sustain from such neglect. Such liabilities frequently arise, and
an attorney may also be liable to his client for the consequences of his want of reasonable care or skill in matters
not in litigation. Business men not infrequently seek legal
advice in making or receiving conveyances of real property,
and it is well settled that an attorney may be liable to his
client for negligence or want of reasonable care and skill in
examining titles in such cases, whether the 6rror occurs in
respect to the title of property purchased or in the cove-

SAYINGS BANK V. WARD.

nants in the instrument of conveyance, where the prop6rty is
sold.
Where the relation of attorney and client exists there is seldom any serious difficulty in determining whether the client
has or has not a cause of action, or its nature and extent if one
exists. Criterions of standard character are established in
legal decisions by which every such controversy may be determined; but in the case before the court the defendant was
never retained or employed by the plaintiffs, nor did they ever
pay him any thing for making the certificates, nor did he ever
perform any service at their request or in their behalf.
Neither fraud nor collusion is alleged or proved; and it is
conceded that the certificates were made by the defendant at
the request of the applicant for the loan, without any knowledge on the part of the defendant what use was to be made of
the same or to whom they were to be presented. None of tlose
matters are controverted ; but the plaintiffs contend that an
attorney in such a case is liable to the immediate sufferer for
negligence in the examination of such a title, although he, the
sufferer, did not employ the defendant, and the case shows that
the service was performed for a third person without any knowledge that the certificate was to be used to procure a loan from
the injured party.
Persons acting professionally in legal formalities, negotiations, or proceedings by the warrant or authority of their clients may be regarded as attorneys-at-law within the meaning
of that designation as used in this country; and all such, when
they undertake to conduct legal controversies or transactions,
profess themselves to be reasonably well acquainted with the
law and the rules and practice of the courts, and they are
bound to exercise in such proceedings a reasonable degree of
care, prudence, diligence, and skill. Authorities everywhere
support that proposition; but attorneys do not profess to
know all the law or to be incapable of error or mistake in
applying it to the facts of every case, as even the most skilful
of the profession would hardly be able to come up to that standard. Unless the client is injured by the deficiencies of his
attorney, he cannot maintain any action for damages; but if he
is injured, the true rule is that the attorney is liable for the

SAVINGS BANK V. WARD.

[Sup. Ot.

want of such skill, care, and diligence as men of the legal profession commonly possess and exercise in such matters of professional employment.
Both parties concur in these suggestions; but the defendant
insists that, in order that such a liability may arise, there must
be some privity of contract between the parties to enable the
plaintiffs to maintain the action; that inasmuch as the defendant was never retained or employed by the plaintiffs, and never
rendered any service at their request or in their behalf, he
cannot be held liable to them for any negligence or want of
reasonable care, skill, or diligence in giving to a third party
the certificates in question.
Beyond all doubt, the general rule is that. the obligation
of the attorney is to his client and not to a third party, and
unless there is something in the circumstances of this case to
take it out of that general rule, it seems clear that the proposition of the defendant must be sustained. Sh. & Redf.
Negl., sect. 215. Conclusive support to that rule is found
in several cases of high authority. Fish v. Kelil, 17 C. B.
7. s. 194.
Argument to show that the direct question was involved
in that case is unnecessary, as the affirmative of the proposition sufficiently appears in the head-note, which is as follows:
That an attorney is not liable to an action for negligence, at
the suit of one between whom and himself the relation of
attorney and client does not exist, for giving, in answer to a
casual inquiry, erroneous information as to the contents of
the deed.
Although the inquiry was addressed directly to the defendant, and the case shows that the answer was given to the
person making it, the court held, Erle, C. J., giving the opinion,
that there was no relation between the parties from which any
contract could be implied, nor any relation between the parties
from which any duty could arise. Mention is then made of
the fact that the defendant was the solicitor of the trustees
of a certain estate, and that the plaintiff was a workman in
the employ of the trustees, from which the court deduced the
conclusion that the parties did not stand in such a relation to
each other as to make it any part of the duty of the defendant

Oct. 1879.]

SAVINGS BANK V. WARD.

to give the plaintiff any professional advice. His answer was
entirely erroneous; but the court decided that he could not be
held responsible, unless it could be shown that at the time he
made it he knew it to be false.
Sufficient appears even in that case alone to show that the
ruling of the subordinate court is correct, but it is a mistake
to suppose that the proposition is without other support than
what is derived from the reasons there assigned for the conclusion. Prior to that, the same question was decided by the
highest court of thie same-country in the same way. Application to an insurance company was made by a certain party for
a loan of money, which the company agreed to make if the
party would insure his life, and assign to them the policy and
give sureties for the payment of interest on the loan. It appears that the plaintiffs became sureties for the applicant, and
that the defendant, a law agent employed by the principal
who applied for the loan, drew up the papers in the transaction,
among which was one intended for the security of the sureties,
which proved to be incomplete. Loss was sustained by the
sureties, and they brought suit against the law agent, charging
that the loss was occasioned by his negligence and want of
skill and other fault. Appearance was entered by the defendant, and he denied the alleged employment. Judgment
was rendered for the plaintiffs in the lower court, and the
defendant appealed to the House of Lords, where the appeal
was argued by very able counsel. Opinions seriatim were
delivered by the law lords. In substance and effect, Lord
Campbell said that he never had any doubt of the unsoundness
of the proposition that would maintain the action in such a
case, and added, that there must be a privity of contract
between the parties, which was not proved in that case.
No attempt was made by the appellee to controvert that
proposition, but his counsel contended that the law of Scotland
was different; that by the law of the latter country a law
agent, in respect of damage occasioned by his neglects, is responsible to those who suffer by his default, although there may
not have subsisted the relation of principal and agent between
them. It was Lord Cranworth who responded to that proposition, and in the course of his judgment he commented upon

SAYINGS BANK V. WARD.

[Sup. Ct.

all the authorities cited in support of the same, and showed
that they failed to establish it.
Emphatic concurrence in the conclusion announced by the
Chancellor was expressed by Lord Wensleydale, to the effect
following: that "he only who, by himself or another as his
agent, employs the attorney to do the particular act in which
the alleged neglect has taken place can sue him for that neglect,
and that that employment must be affirmed in the declaration
of the suit in distinct terms."
By the law of England the right of action depends entirely
upon the question between whom the relation of principal and
agent, client and attorney, subsists. Nothing more decisive of
the question need be sought; and we have the authority of
that great magistrate to say that it is impossible to support,
by a single case in that country, so extraordinary a proposition
as that persons who were not, by themselves or their agents,
employers of law agents to do an act, could have remedy
against such agents for the negligent performance of it.
Speaking to the same point, Lord Chelmsford said it is clear
that this general proposition, abstracted from the facts of the
case, cannot be maintained to its full extent, as it would apply
to cases where there is no privity of contract between the
parties, when it is conceded that no liability would arise.
1?obertson v. Fleming, 4 Macq. I. of L. Cas. 167, 209.
Analogous cases involving the same principle are quite numerous, a few of which only will be noticed. They show to a
demonstration that it is not every one who suffers a loss from
the negligence of another that can maintain a suit on such
grounds. On the contrary, the limit of the doctrine relating
to actionable negligence, says Beasley, C. J., is, that the person occasioning the loss must owe a duty, arising from contract
or otherwise, to the person sustaining sucL loss. Such a restriction on the right to sue for a want of care in the exercise
of employments or the transaction of business is plainly necessary to restrain the remedy from being pushed to an impracticable extreme. There would be no bounds to actions and
litigiotis intricacies if the ill effects of the negligence of men
may be followed down the chain of results to the final effect.
al v. Love, 87 N. J. L. 5, 8.

Oct. 1879.]

SAVINGS BANK V. WARD.

Injury was received by the driver of a mail-coach which
broke down from defects in its construction. He brought suit
against the constructor of the coach who sold the same to the
owner of the line in whose employment the plaintiff was engaged when the accident happened. Held, by the whole court,
that the action would not lie, as there is no privity of contract
between the parties. Unless we confine the operation of such
contracts as this to the parties who entered into them, saia
Lord Abinger, the most absurd consequences, to which no limit
can be seen, will ensue; and Baron Alderson remarked, if we
hold that the plaintiff can sue in such a case, there is no point
at which such actions will stop. The only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract;
if we go one step beyond that, there is no reason why we
should not go fifty. Winterbottom v. Wright, 10 Mee. & W.
109, 115.
Cases where fraud and collusion are alleged and proved constitute exceptions to that rule, and Parke, B., very properly
admits, in the following case, that other exceptions to it exist
which are as sound in principle as the judgments which establish the rule. Longreid v. Hfolliday, 6 Exch. Rep. 761-767.
Examples of the kind are given in that case, two of which
deserve to be noticed, as they have been urged in argument to
disprove the rule; but they cannot have any such effect, for the
plain reason that they stand in many respects upon a different
footing. These cases, say the court in that opinion, occur
where there has been a wrong done to the person, for which
he wuuld have a right of action, though no such contract had
been made; and the court gives as an illustration the patient
injured by improper medicines prepared by an apothecary, or
one unskilfully treated by a surgeon, where both would be
liable to the injured party even if the father or friend of the
patient contracted with the wrong-doer. Reported cases of the
kind are cited by the plaintiffs, but it is obvious that they have
no proper application to the case before the court. Pepp n

(Sup. Oth

Many judicial decisions in this country besides those cited
also adopt the same rule and fully recognize the same class of
exceptions.
Pharmacists or apothecaries who compound or sell medicines,
if Jhey carelessly label a poison as a harmless medicine, and
send it so labelled into the market, are liable to all persons
who, without fault on their part, are injured by using it as
such medicine, in consequence of the false label; the rule being
that the liability in such a case arises not out of any contract
or direct privity between the wrong-doer and the person injured,
but out of the duty which the law imposes on him to avoid acts
in their nature dangerous to the lives of others. He is liable,
therefore, though the poisonous drug with the label may have
passed through many intermediate sales before it reached the
hands of the person injured. Thomas v. Winclester, 2 Seld.
397, 410.
Such an act of negligence being imminently dangerous to
the lives of others, the wrong-doer is liable to the injured party,
whether there be any contract between them or not. Where
the wrongful act is not immediately dangerous to the lives of
others, the negligent party, unless he be a public agent in the
performance of some duty, is in general liable only to the party
with whom he contracted, and on the ground that negligence
is a breach of the contract. Collis v. Selden, Law Rep. 3 0. P.
496.
Builders of a public work are answerable only to their employers for any want of reasonable care and skill in executing
their contract, and they are not liable to third persons for
accidents or injuries which may happen to them from imperfections of the structure after the same is completed and has
been accepted by the employers. The lJ3allor, c. of Albany v.
Cunliff, 2 N. Y. 165, 174.
Misfortune tb third persons not parties to the contract would
not be a natural and necessary consequence of the builder's negligence, and such negligence is not an act imminently dangerous to human life. Loop v. Litchfteld, 42 id. 351-358.
So where the manufacturer of a steam-boiler sold it to a
paper company, it was held that the seller was only liable to

skill in its construction, and if after delivery to and acceptance
by the purchaser, and while in use by him an explosion occurs
in consequence of such defective construction, to the injury of
third persons, the latter will have no cause of action against
the manufacturer. Losee v. Clute, 51 id. 494-496.
Exactly the same rule prevails in the State of Pennsylvania,
independent of any statutory regulation upon the subject, the
Supreme Court of the State holding that the liability of th
recorder in such a case is to the party who asks and pays for
the certificate, and not to his assigns or alienee. ifousemnan v.
Girardilutual Building Loan Assooiation, 81 Pa. St. 256.
Satisfactory proof is exhibited that the 'lfendant was duly
employed by the pretended owner of the lot to examine his
title to the same; and it is conceded that he did so, or that his
son made the search for him, and that he made and signed the
certificates in question, and that he was paid for his services
by his employer; nor is it questioned that the title was defective as alleged. Concede that, and it follows as an implication
of law that the defendant assumed to possess the requisite
knowledge and experience to perform the stipulated service,
and that he contracted with his employer that he would use
reasonable care and skill in the performance of the duties.
For a failure in either of these respects, if it resulted in
damage to his employer, lie, the employer, is entitled to recover compensation. Ch1ase v. Heaneyl, 70 Ill. 268.
Decisions of the courts of the highest authority support that
proposition; but the difficulty in the way of the plaintiffs is
that they never employed the defendant to search he records,
examine the title, or make the report, and it clearly appears
that he never performed any such service at their request or
in their behalf, and that they never paid him any thing for the
service he did perform in respect to 'hat transaction; nor is
ihere any evidence tending tf show any privity of contract
between them and the defendant, within the meaning of the
law as expounded by the decisions of the court.
Every imputation of fraud is disclaimed, and it is clear that
the transaction is not one immediately dangerous to the lives
of others. Where there is fraud or collusion, the party will be
held liable, even though there is no privity of contract; but

SAVINGS BANK V. WARD.

[Sup. Ct.

where there is neither fraud or collusion nor privity of contract, the party will not be held liable, unless the act is one
imminently dangerous to the lives of others, or is an act per
formed in pursuance of some legal duty. Langridge v. L vy,
2 Mee. & W. 519, 530.
We agree, said Lord Denman, C.J., and affirm the judgment,
on the ground stated by Parke, B., that as there is fraud and
damage the result of that fraud, not from an act remote and
consequential, but one contemplated by the defendant at the
time as one of the results, the party guilty of the fraud is responsible to the party injured. Langridge v. Levy, 4 Mee. &
W. 337.
Abstracts of titles and certificates of the same are frequently
if not usually made by recorders, prothonotaries, or clerks, and
in some States their liability is prescribed and regulated by
statute. Sess. Laws (Pa.), 1872, 1040.
By that act those officers are declared liable for all loss or
damage which may happen by reason of any false or erroneous
certificate of search, not only to the person or persons to, for,
or upon whose order the said certificate of search is made or
given, but also to any person or persons claiming title through,
from, or under such person or persons, or who may suffer loss
by reason of the making or giving of any such false or erroneous certificate. But it is unnecessary to enter into any discussion of such regulations, as it is clear that there are none
such in this District which can have any application in this
case.
Testimony was introduced at the trial tending to show that
there is a local usage in the District that the attorney examining the title of such an applicant for a loan shall be considered
as also acting for the lender of the money, and complaint is
made that the court below did not submit that evidence to the
jury, with proper instructions. Evidence of usage is not admissible to contradict or vary what is clear and unambiguous, or to restrict or enlarge what requires no explanation.
Omissions may be supplied in some cases by such proof, but it
canfot prevail over or nullify the express provisions of the
contract. So, where there is no contract, proof of usage will
not make one, and it can only be admitted either to interpret

the meaning of the language employed by the parties, or where
the meaning is equivocal or obscure. Thonipson v. Biggs, 5
Wall. 663, 679.
Suffice it to say these parties never met, and there was no
communication of any kind between the defendant and the
brokers, or the lenders of the money. Nothing of the kind is
pretended, the only suggestion in that direction being that it
may be held that the applicant for the loan, when he employed
the defendant, may be regarded as the agent of the plaintiffs.
Suoh suggestion being entirely without evidence to support it,
is entirely to no weight, especially as it appears that the principal certificate was procured several days before any interview
upon the subject of the loan took place between the brokers
and the plaintiffs.
Jthdgment affitrmed.
AIR. CHIEF JUSTICE WArrE, with whom concurred MR. JusTICE SWAYNE and MR. JUSTIcE BRADLEY, dissenting.
I am unable to agree to the judgment in this case. I think
if a lawyer, employed to examine and certify to the recorded
title of real property, gives his client a certificate which he
knows or ought to know is to be used by the client in some
business transaction with another person as evidence of the
facts certified to, he is liable to such other person relying on
his certificate for any loss resulting from his failure to find on
record a conveyance affecting the title, which, by the use of
ordinary professional care and skill, he might have found.
That, as it seems to me, is this case. Ward was employed by
Chapman to examine and certify to the title to a certain lot
in Washington. The circumstances were such as ought to have

satisfied him that his certificate was to be used by Chapman
in some transaction with another person as evidence of the
facts certified to. In examining the records he overlooked a
deed, in all respects properly recorded, which showed on its
face that Chapman had conveyed the lot away in fee-simple,
and certified as follows: "Lot 55, in Chapman's subdivision of
lots, in square 364. The title of Leonard S. Chapman to the
above lot is good and the property is unincumbered. Wm.i.
Ward." The National Savings Bank, relying on this certifi-

cate as true, loaned Chapman $3,500, taking for security a
deed of trust of the lot. It seems to me that under these circumstances Ward is liable to the bank for any loss it may sustain by reason of his erroneous certificate.
