APPEAL from the Court of Claims.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
ir. Assistant Attorney- General Smith for the United States.
3ir. Robert S. -avis, contra.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
This suit was brought to enforce an alleged liability of the
United States, under sects. 2154 and 2155 of the Revised
Statutes, to pay the value of twenty-three head of beef cattle,
stolen from the claimant, a friendly Indian, within the Indian
country.
These sections are as follows :
"SECT. 2154. Whenever, in the commission, by a white person, of any crime, offence, or misdemeanor within the Indian country, the property of. any friendly Indian is taken, injured, or
destroyed, and a conviction is had for such crime, offence, or
misdemeanor, the person so convicted shall be sentenced to pay
to such friendly Indian to whom the property may belong, or
whose person may be injured, a sum equal to twice the just value
of the property so taken, injured, or destroyed.
"SECT. 2155. If such offender shall be unable to pay a sum at
least equal to the just value or amount, whatever such payment shall
fall short of the same shall be paid out of the treasury of the United
States. If such offender cannot be apprehended and brought to
trial, the amount of such property shall be paid out of the treasury.
But no Indian shall be entitled to any payment out of the treasury
of the United States, for any such property, if he, or any of the
nation to which he belongs, have sought private revenge, or have
attempted to obtain satisfaction by any force or violence."

This is a substantial reproduction of sect. 16 of the act
entitled "An Act to regulate trade and intercourse with the

[Sup. Ct.

Indian tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontiers," approved
June 30, 1834 (4 Stat. 731), and which continued in force
until the Revised Statutes went into effect.
The facts are briefly these: On, the 18th of December,
1874, Henry Carter, a negro, and not an Indian, and John
Conner, a white man, stole from the claimant, a friendly Creek
Indian, in the Indian country, the cattle sued for. At the
May Term, 1875, of the District Court of the United States
for the Western District of Arkansas, both Carter and Conner were indicted for the larceny. Afterwards, a nolle prosel ti
was entered as to Conner, and he was discharged ; but Carter
was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to pay to the claimant
double the value of the cattle stolen, and be imprisoned in the
penitentiary. He being unable to pay the judgment, this suit
was brought. The Court of Claims was divided on the question whether the United States were liable in such a case for a
theft committed by a negro, and, in order to allow an appeal,
gave judgment pro formna for the claimant. From this judgment the United States appealed.
The single question we have to consider is, whether the
United States are liable under the statute td the claimant,
since the only offender who has been convicted and sentenced
to pay for the property stolen was a negro, and not a white
person. The term "white person," in the Revised StatuteF,
must be given the same meaning it had in the original act of
1834. Congress has nowhere manifested an intention of using
it in a different sense. While the negro, under the operation
of the constitutional amendments, has- been endowed with certain civil and political rights which he did not have in 1834,
he is no more, in fact, a white person now than he was then.
ie is a citizen of the United States, and free. No State can
abridge his privileges and immunities as a citizen, or deny him
the equal protectidn of the laws ; but his race and color are the
same, and he is no more included now within the descriptiveterm of a white person, than he always has been. If, then,
this term was used in the act of 1834 to exclude the liability
of the United States. for the depredations of the negroes in the
Indian country, it must be considered as having been so used
in the Revised Statutes. There may be no good reason for

restricting any longer this liability to acts of whites; but until
Congress sees fit to change the statute in this particular, the
courts are not at liberty to disregard the law as it is left to
stand. The question is not as to the effect of the constitutional amendments on an existing statute affecting the civil or
political rights of the negro himself, but as to the meaning of
the words "white person," when used as words of description
in a statute making the United States liable for the acts of the
persons described. No rights of the negro himself, as a citizen,
or otherwise, are in any way involved.
It is contended, however, that the term "white person," as
here used, means no more than "not an Indian;" in other
words, that the intention of Congress was to make the United
States liable in the way indicated for all injuries to the property of friendly Indians by persons engaged in crime within
the Indian Territory who were not themselves Indians. Such,
we think, is not the true construction of the statute. The act
of 1834 was not the first statute upon this subject. On the
19th of May, 1796, an act was passed "to regulate trade and
intercourse with the Indian tribes and to preserve peace on the
frontiers." 1 Stat. 469. In this statute various provisions
were made in respect to "any citizen of, or other person resident in, the United States or either of the territorial districts
of the United States;" and the liability of the United States
for depredations, &c., was extended to certain specified acts of
all such persons. This statute expired by its own limitation
in 1799, and on the 3d of March of that year another was
passed with similar provisions, which continued in force for
three years. Id. 743. On the 30th of March, 1802, a permanent statute on the same subject was passed (2 id. 139), making much the same general provisions. In this also various
penalties were prescribed for certain acts by "any citizen of,
or other person resident in, the United States, or either of the
territorial districts of the United States." - The liability of the
United States for injuries to the property of friendly Indians
was extended to the enumerated acts of all "such citizens orother persons," the same as in the statute of 1796. This continued in force until that of 1834, supra, was passed. In the
statute of 1834 the phrase "any citizen or other person resid-

(Sup. Ot

ing within the United States or the territory thereof" is retained in all the provisions for penalties, &c., except in sect.
16, which was evidently intended to take the place of sect. 4
in the statute of 1802, providing for the liability of the United
States for injuries by certain persons to the property of
friendly Indians. In that section (16) the words "a white
person " were substituted for "any such citizen or other person;" that is to say, "any citizen or other person resident of
the United States," &c. It is impossible to believe that this
was not done for a purpose. Had the phraseology throughout
the entire statute been correspondingly changed, the question
might have been different; but, confined as the change was
to this particular section, we cannot but think that Congress
meant just what the language used conveys to the popular
mind. The Cherokee nation, which had given the State of
Georgia so much trouble, was about to remove to its new
home west of the Mississippi. It was, no doubt, thought if
the United States made themselves liable only for such depredations as were committed by the whites, these and other
Indians would be less likely to tolerate fugitive blacks in their
country. Hence, as a means of preventing the escape of slaves,
the change in the law was made. Although the reason of the
change no longer exists, Congress has seen fit to keep the law
as it was. As the right is statutory, the claimant cannot recover unless he brings himself within the terms of the statute.
That he has not done.
The judgment of the Court of Claims will be reversed, and
the cause remanded with instructions to dismiss the petition;
So ordered.
