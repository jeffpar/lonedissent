RAILWAY Co. v. TWOMBLY.

[Sup. Ot.

Whether or not the article importdd was a new preparation,
and something other than ground chicory, that is to say, whether
it was prepared chicory and not simply ground chicory, was a
question of fact that was properly left to the jury.
Judgment affirmed.

RAILWAY Co-xANY v. TWO rBLY.
1. Where a party moving for a new trial assigns as reasons therefor that tae
verdict is not sustained by the evidence, and that the court erred in giving
certain instructions and in refusing others,- Held, that, as he did not at
the time except to the ruling of the court in regard to the instructions, they
cannot be reviewed by the appellate cnurt, although they are incorpoiated
in the bill of exceptions allowed on the refusal of the court of original jurisdiction to grant a new trial.
2. The Supreme Court of the Territory of Colorado, therefore, properly held
that such a bill of exceptions only presented for review the refusal of the
District Court, on the motion for a new trial, to set aside the verdict on
the ground that it was not sustained by the evidence. Such a question
cannot be re-examined here on a writ of error.
3. The administratrix of A. recovered judgment for damages by reason of his
death, caused by the negligence of 13., who thereupon sued out of this curt
a writ of error. During its pendency, the statute authorizing such a ,uit
was repealed. Held, that the judgment was not vacated by the writ, and
that it must he affirmed, no error appearing in the proceeding,; below.

ErroR to the Supreme Court of the Territory of Colorado.
This was an action of trespass on the case, brought Aug. 30,
1873, in the District Court of the first judicial district for the
county of Arapahoe, in the then Territory of Colorado, by
Louisa Twombly, widow and adininistratrix of George W. K.
Twombly, deceased, against the Kansas Pacific Railway Company, to recover damages for his death, caused, as she alleged,
by the negligence of the agents and servants of the company,
who were charged with the control and management of a locomotive and train of cars upon its road. Plea, not guilty. The
issue was tried by a jury, and a verdict returned for the plaintiff at the April Term, 1874. A motion for a new trial, for
reasons filed therewith, was then made. It was, at the October
Term, argued and overruled, and judgment rendered; which, on

Oct. 1879.1

RAILWAY Co. v. TWOMBLY.

appeal to the Supreme Court of the Territory, was affirmed,
:March 28, 1876.
The company excepted to the overruling of the motion for a
new trial. Its bill of exceptions was tendered within the time
limited therefor, and was signed and sealed by the court.
Among other reasons filed for a new trial is that the court
"erred, in refusing to give to the jury each and every instruction asked by the defendant, and also in giving each and every
instruction not asked by the defendant;" but it does not appear
that, at the time when instructions were giyen or refused, an
exception was reserved and brought into the record by bill of
exceptions.
The Statute of Colorado (Rev. Stat. Col. 1868, 508) provides that in all cases "wh1ere either party shall except to any
ruling, decision, or.opinion of the court, and shall reduce such
exception or exceptions to writing, it shall be the duty of the
judge to allow the same, alhd sign and seal the same, at any
time during the term of the court at which such exceptions
were taken, or at any time thereafter to be fixed by -the
court."
The Supreme Court, on motion of the appellee, struck out
from the bill of exceptions tendered on the refusal to grant a
new trial all that part relating to the instructions.
The action was founded upon an act of the Territory approved Feb. 8, 1873, providing that "when the death of any
person is caused by the wrongful act, misconduct, negligence,
or omission of another, the personal representatives of the fori-.er may maintain an action therefor against the latter, if the
former might have maintained an action had he or she lived,
against the latter for the same act, misconduct, negligence, or.
omission: Provided, the adtion shall .be commenced -within
two years from the date of the death of tLe injured person;
that the damages shall inure to the exclusive benefit, first, of
the husband or wife, if living, and if there be no husband or
wife, to the child or childen of the deceased; secondly, if
there is neither a husband, wife, child or children living, then
to the father and mother, or to the surviving parent, if anv."
This ac -was repealed by a statute of the State of Coiorado,
March 7, 1877. This writ of error, and a duly approved and

RAILWAY Co. v. TWOMBLY.

[Sup. 0t.

accepted bond to render it a supersedeas,were filed in the clerk's
office of the Supreme Court of the Territory, May 4, 1876.
Mr. John P. Usher and fr. Samuel 'Shellabarger for the
plaintiff in error.
This action was brought, not upon a contract, or for the
enforcement of a common-law right, but upon a statute, which
allowed the recovery of damages in the nature of a penalty.
It is submitted, 1. That when such an act is repealed, it must be regarded,
so far as pending actions are concerned, as if it hqd never
existed. Upon its repeal, the right of action, unless there be
some special saving, expires. NAorris v. Crocicer, 13 How. 329 ;Yeaton v. United States, 5 Cranch, 281 ; Bex v. Justices of
London, 3 Burr. 1456. There dan be no'doubt, therefore, that
had this suit been pending in the subordinate courts at the date
of the absolute repeal of the act of 1873, it would have then
terminated.
2. The fact that such repeal took place after the appellate
jurisdiction of this court had been invoked and the bond filed
does not exclude or vary the operation of that rule.
In Yeaton v. United States (supra), a schooner was condemned in admiralty for the breach of an act of Congress
then in force. The claimants appealed here. The act having
by its own limitation expired, this court reversed the sentence
of condemnation, although unquestionably proper when rendered, and directions were given to the court below to dismiss
the libel.
The ruling thefi made, although in an admiralty case, is
applicable whenever this court exercises its jurisdiction in a
suit pending here, when the statute authorizing it is repealed,
- the controlling question being, what is the .law applicable
to the rights of the parties to the record, when that jurisdiction is exercised. Lewis v. Foster (1 N. H. 61) was a case at
law. Judgment was rendered in an action of debt upon a statute which entitled the plaintiff to the whole penalty. The
defendant removed the case to the Supreme Court, where, by
reason of the repeal of the statute in the intervening time, it
was decided that every right gained by the judgment was subject to be lost on a review of the cause, and that there being

Oct. 1879.]

RAILWAY

Co. v. TWOMBLY.

no act then in force authorizing it, a judgment could not be
rendered in his favor in the court of last res6rt.
It thus appears that, whatever be the nature of the suit, the
rule is the same in the appellate court, the only distinction
being that in some cases the re-examination is confined to
questions of law, while in others it extends to matters of fact.
The bond which stays the proceedings below does not, in any
instance, annul the judgment or the decree, nor vacate the
lien thereby created. The judgment should be reversed, with
instructions to the court below to dismiss the suit.
Counsel discussed at length the instructions to the jury. Inasmuch as they were not excepted to and the questions arising thereon reserved, they were not passed upon by the court.
The argument upon them is, therefore, omitted.
Jlfr. J. Q. Charles, contra.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
We think that the court below was right in holding that the
bill of exceptions only presented for review the refusal of. the
District Court, on the motion for a new trial, to set aside the verdict because not sustained by the evidence. It is well settled
that such a question cannot be re-examined here on a writ of
error. Jlfarine Insurance Co. v. Young, 5 Cranch, 187; Barr
v. Gratz's Heirs, 4 Wheat. 213; Oullhall v. Keenan, 18 Wall.
842.
Neither can we, as is asked, send the case back to the court
below, with instructions to enter a judgment of nonsuit,
because since the judgment below, and while this writ of error
has been pending, the statute authorizing the action has been
repealed. A writ of error to this court does not vacate the
judgment below. That continues in force until reversed, which
is ofily done when errors are found in the record on which it
rests, and which were committed previous to its rendition.
Here there are no such errors. All we can do, therefore, is to
affirm the judgment, and send our mandate to that effect to the
court below.
Judgment affirmed.
