JUSTIcE WAiTE delivered the opinion of the

In Gray v. Blanchard (97 U. S. 564), we held that a case
I.ust be dismissed, if, on an examination of the whole record,
it appeared that the value of the mAtter actually in dispute
becween the parties was less than our jurisdictional amount.
TLis writ of error was brought by the defendant below to
reverse a judgment against him of more than $5,000; but on
looking into the record we find that the cqse was heard on an
agreed statement of facts in the nature of a special verdict, in
which it appeared that the plaintiff claimed of the defendant
$8,233.79, and interest from June 4, 1876. The defendant admitted that he owed of this amount $5,099.59, for which the
plaintiff was entitled to a judgment. The only controvdrsy was
as to the liability of the defendant for the difference between
what he admitted to be due and what the plaintiff claimed, or
$3,184.20. This, then, is the amount actually in dispute/and as
it is less than $5,000, we have no jurisdiction.
Writ dismissed.
