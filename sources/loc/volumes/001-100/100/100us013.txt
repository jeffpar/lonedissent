1. The regularly appointed clerk of a paymaster in the navy is a "person in
the naval service of the United States," within the meaning of art. 14,
sect. 1624, of the Revised Statutes, and, for a violation of its provisions, is
subject to he tried, convicted, and sentenced by a naval general court,
martial.
2. The "rgulations for the administration of law and justice" in that service,
established by the Secretary of the Navy with the approval of the President, have the force of law.
3, Where, pursuant to such regulations, a general court-martial is duly ordered,
the officer clothed with the revising authority may, before it is dissolved,
direct it to reconsider its proceedings and sentence; and if it, upon being
reconvened, renders a sentence, which he approves, such sentence cannot
be collaterally impeached for mere errors or irregularities, if any such were
committed by the court while acting within the sphere of its authority.
I. A., the clerk of a paymaster in the navy, was, by a court-martial, found guilty
of certain charges and specifications of malfeasance in the discharge of his
official duties. Sentence was passed upon him, and transmitted, with the
record, to the revising officer, who returned it with a letter stating that
the finding was in accordance with the evidence, but that he differed with
the court as to the adequacy of the sentence. The court proceeded to
revise it, and, after revoking it, substituted another, which he approved,
inflicting upon A. a severer punishment. A., who was imprisoned pursuant thereto, alleging that it was illegal and void, and that he was thereby
unlawfully deprived of his liberty, prayed for a writ of habeas corpus. Held,
that the court-martial had jurisdiction of the person and of the subjectmatter, and was competent to pass the sentence whereof A. complained.

MR. GEORGE S. BOUTWELI, presented the following petition of Alvin R. Reed for a writ of habeas corpus :
"To thre

Courts-martial are exceptional in their organization, 'urisdiction, modes of procedure, and the rules by which findings
are made or judgments pronounced. In an ordinary judicial
tribunal, nothing, therefore, is to be presumed in their favor.

Paymasters' clerks are only recognized indirectly in the
chapter on the organization of the navy. By sects. 1886,
1387, 1388, Rev. Stat., paymasters and assistant paymasters
are, under certain circumstances, allowed clerks. By sect.
1556 their pay is fixed. For the same reason, by sect. 1867,
the admiral and vice-admiral are each allowed a secretary to
aid in the discharge of their respective duties. Sect. 1866 provides that "the active list of the pay corps of the navy shall
consist of thirteen pay directors, thirteen pay inspectors, fifty
paymasters, thirty passed assistant paymasters, and twenty
assistant paymasters." Sect. 1383 requires every paymaster,
passed assistant paymaster, and assistant paymaster to give
bonds for the faithful performance of his duties. No such
obligation is laid upon paymasters' clerks, nor are they officers
holding either commissions or warrants, nor are they deemed
petty officers. Sect. 1410.
If a reasonable doubt exists whether paymasters' clerks are
of the naval force and subject to the jurisdiction of a courtmartial, the petitioner is entitled to the writ.

1. There is no common law of the United States. Wheaton
v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591. As the existence, jurisdiction, and
powers of courts-martial are exceptional, with stronger reason
it can be maintained that such courts have no common law,
and hence any reference to the usages or laws of Great Britain
is inapplicable to this case. In one particular, by the statute
of 1799 (1 Stat. 715), the common law of nations, which was
the law of Great Britain, was incorporated in our naval code.
The statute was in these words: "All faults, disorders, and
misdemeanors which sfiall be committed on board any ship
belonging to the United States, and which are not herein mentioned, shall be punished according to the laws and customs in
such cases at sea." It was superseded by art. 22, sect. 1624, Rev.
Stat., which provides that "all offences committed by persons
belonging to the navy which are not specified in the foiegoing
articles shall be punished as a court-martial may direct."
The adoption, however, of one common-la1 w rule by statute
excludes the idea that, by virtue of the Constitution, the naval
usages and laws of Great Britain became a part of our naval
code.
As Reed was tried upon the charge of malfeasance and
misdemeanors prohibited specifically in the rules and articles
for the government of the navy, his case did not fall under
art. 22.
2. Sect. 1624, Rev. Stat., provides a system for the organization and conduct of naval courts-martial, and their proceedings
are valid only when the statutes are followed and obeyed.
3. As the case of the government is now understood by the
counsel for the petitioner, the act of Rear-Admiral Nichols, in
sending the sentence of the 17th of July to the court for revision, is justified under art. 54 of sect. 1624 of the Revised
Statutes, which declares that "every officer who is authorized
to convene a court-martial shall have power, on revision of its
proceedings, to remit or mitigate, but not to commute, the
sentence of any such court which he is authorized to approve
and confirm;" and by sect. 262 of the rules and regulations
for the administration of law and" justice in the navy, as auVOL. X.

thorized or confirmed by sect. 1547 of the Revised Statutes,
which provides that "the authority who ordered the court is
competent to direct it to reconsider its proceedings and sentence, for the purpose of correcting any mistake which may
have been committed." Regulations for the Administration
of Law and Justice in the U. S. Navy, 1870, p. 49. Sect. 1547,
Rev. Stat., is as follows: "The orders, regulations, and instructions issued by the Secretary of the Navy prior to July 14,
1862, with such alterations as he may since have adopted, with
the approval of the President, shall be recognized as the regulations of the navy, subject to alterations adopted in the same
manner."
Sect. 5 of the statute of July 14, 1862 (12 Stat. 665), provides "that the orders, regulations, and instructions heretofore
issued by the Secrtirry -f the Navy be, and they are hereby,
recognized as the regulations of the Navy Department, subject, however, to such alterations as the Secretary of the Navy
may adopt, with the approbation of the President of the United
States."
The position of the government is not tenable, and for these
reasons: -

a. If the regulation of the department had, in precise words,
been enacted in a statute, Rear-Admiral Nichols would have
-hadno lawful authority for doing what was done.
He could then have directed the court to reconsider its sentence only for the purpose of correcting a mistake in matter
of law or in matter of fact. What he alleged as having happened in the court was neither, being only, in his opinion, an
error of judgment within the limits of the discretion conferred
by law upon courts-martial.
6. But if it were otherwise, and the regulation of the departmenit be construed as giving him authority to direct the court
to reconsider its sentence for any reason that seemed to him
sufficient, that regulation would be valid only so far as it conformed to the Cons4itution and laws. If in any respedt it
exceeded the limits which they impose, it would not bind even
the officers and men of the navy, and with stronger reason it
could not be invoked to deprive a citizen of his right to be
tried according to the laws of the country.

1X PARTE REED..

Art. 54 of sect. 1624, Rev. Stat., specifically limits the authority which the officer convening a court-martial has to
revise its proceedings. He may confirm, remit, or mitigate
the sentence, but cannot increase it either directly or indirectly, or even transmit it to any one except his superior in
office.
c. The sole power of revision was in the admiral himself,
and the manner of its exercise was prescribed in that article.
When the sentence was signed and transmitted, the power of
the court over it ended; and neither by any original action on
its own part, nor by delegation from another, could that power
be revived.
It is claimed on behalf of the petitioner that when, on the
17th of July, the sentence was made, signed by the several
members of the court, recorded, and transmitted to the admiral, not only were the powers of the court exhausted, but the
court itself ceased to exist. His action was equivalent to a
formal dissolution of the court, and the members who had composed it were thereafter utterly incapable of lawfully doing
any act or thing touching or affecting the rights or the liberty
of Reed. It follows that on the 22d of July, 1878, when the
so-called sentence, whose validity is now under consideration,
was pronounced and recorded, a legally constituted court-martial for his trial did not exist. He has therefore been twice
put in peril for the same offence, or he is now deprived of his
liberty without due process of law. In either case, his imprisonment is contrary to the guaranty contained in art. 5 of
the amendments to the Constitution. Osborn v. NichTolson,

JUSTICE SWAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.

There is no controversy in this case about the facts. The
questions.we are called on to'consider are all questions of law.
A byief summary of the facts will therefore be sufficient.
The petitioner, Reed, was the clerk of a paymaster in the
navy of the United States. He was duly appointed, and had
accepted by a letter, wherein, as required, he bound himself "to
be subject to the laws and regulations for the government of

EX PARTE REED.

[Sup. Ct.

the navy and the discipline of the vessel." His name was
placed on the proper muster-roll, and he entered upon the discharge of his duties. While serving in this capacity, charges
of malfeasance were preferred against him, and on the 26th of
June, 1878, he was directed by Rear-Admiral Nichols to
appear and answer before a general court-martial, convened
pursuant to the order of that officer on board the United States
ship ",Essex," then stationed at Rio Janeiro, in Brazil. The
court found the petitioner guilty, and sentenced him accordingly. The admiral declined to approve the sentence, and
remitted the proceedings back to the court, that the sentence
might be revised. The court thereupon pronounced the following sentence in substitution for the former one "That the said Alvin R. Reed, paymaster's clerk, U. S.
Navy, be imprisoned in such place as the honorable Secretary
of the Navy may designate, for the term of two years; to lose
all pay which may become due him during such confinement,
excepting the sum of $10 per month, this loss amounting
to $1,960; to be fined in the sum of $500, which fine must
be paid before or at the end of the term of confinement.
Should such fine not be paid at end of the term of confinement,
to be detained in confinement without pay until such fine be
paid, and at the expiration of the term of confinement to be
dishonorably dismissed from the naval service of the United
States."
This sentence was different from the preceding one in two
particulars, and in both it was more severe. It was approved
by the admiral, and ordered to be carried out. Th court was
subsequently dissolved. While in confinement, under the sentence, on board a naval vessel at Boston, the petitioner sued
-out a writ of habeas corpus, and brought his case before the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts. After a full hearing, that court adjudged against him,
and ordered him back into the custody of the naval officer
to whom the writ was addressed. The petitioner thereupon
made this application in order that the conclusions reached by
the Circuit Court may be reviewed by this tribunal.
It is supposed that courts-martial were intended originally to
be a partial substitute for the court of chivalry of former times.

The constitutionality of the acts of Congress touching army
and navy courts-martial in this country, if there could ever
have been a doubt about it, is no longer an open question in
this court. Const., art. 1, sect. 8, and amendment 5. In Dylnes
v. Hfoover (20 How. 65), the subject was fully considered and
their validity affirmed.
The regularity of the original organization of the court here
in question is not denied.
Three points in support of the petition have been brought to
our attention. It is insisted 1. That the court had no jurisdiction to try a paymaster's
clerk.
2. That when the first sentence was pronounced, the power
rf the court was exhausted, and that the second sentence was,
therefore, a nullity.
3. That the court could revise its former sentence only on
the ground of mistake, and that there was no mistake, and consequently no power of revision.
The first of these propositions is clearl? not maintainable.
Wrhere the punishment is death, or fine and imprisonment,
the jurisdiction in question is extended to all persons "in the
naval seigvice of the United States" (Rev. Stat., sect. 1624, arts.
4, 14); and it embraces, besides the frauds enumerated, "any
other fraud against the United States." Id., art. 14.
In case of conviction, adequate punishment is required to be
adjudged. Id., art. 51.
Except where the sentence is death or the dismissal of a
commissioned or warrant officer, it may be executed when confirmed by the officer ordering the court. Id., art. 58.

machinery of the navy. Their appointment must be approved
by the commander of the ship. Their acceptance and agreement to submit to the laws and regulations for the government
and discipline of the navy must be in writing, and filed in the
department. They must take an oath, and bind themselves to
serve until discharged. The discharge must be by the appointing power, and approved in the same manner as the
appointment. They are required to wear the uniform of
the service; they have a fixed rank; they are upon the payroll, and are paid accordingly. They may also become entitled
to a pension and to bounty land. Navy Regulations of Aug.

The good order and efficiency of the service depend largely
upon the faithful performance of their duties.
If these officers are not in the naval service, it may well be
asked who are.
The second and third points will be considered together.
The Secretary of the Navy is authorized to establish "Regulations of the Navy," with the approval of the President.
12 Stat. 565; Rev. Stat., sect. 1547. Such "Regulations for
the Administration of Law and Justice" were issued on the
15th of April, 1870. Thereby it is declared as follows: "The authority who ordered the court is competent to direct it
to reconsider its proceedings and sentence for the purpose of correcting any mistake which may have been committed.
"It is not the power of the revising authority to compel a court
to change its sentence, where, upon being reconvened by him, they
have refused to modify it, nor directly or indirectly to enlarge the
measure of punishment imposed by sentence of a court-martial.
"The proceedings must be sent back for revision before the
court shall have been dissolved:' Reg., c. 5, sects. 262-264.
Such regtlations have the force of law. Gratiot v. United
States, 4 How. 80.
The proceedings with respect to the revision of the second
sentenca were in conformity to these provisions.
It is clear that the court was not dissolved until after the
approval of the second sentence by the admiral.

The court had jurisdiction over the person and the case.
It is the organism provided by law and clothed with the duty
of administering justice in this class of cases. Having had
such jurisdiction, its proceedings cannot be collaterally impeached for any mere error or irregularity, if there were such,
committed within the sphere of its authority. Its judgments,
when approved as required, rest on the same basis, and are
surrounded by the same considerations which give conclusiveness to the judgments of other legal tribunals, including as
well the lowest as the highest, under like circumstances. The
exercise of discretion, within authorized limits, cannot be
assigned for error and made the subject of review by an appellate court.
We do not overlook the point that there must be jurisdiction
to give the judgment rendered, as well as to hear and determine the cause. If a magistrate having authority to fine for
assault and battery should sentence the offehder to be imprisoned in the penitentiary, or to suffer the punishment prescribed
for homicide, his judgment would be as much a nullity as if
the preliminary jurisdiction to hear and determine had not
existed. Every act of a court beyond its jurisdiction is void.
Cormett v. Williams, 20 Wall. 226; Windsor v. .iolFeigh, 93
U. S. 274; 7 Wait's Actions and Defences, 181. Here there
was no defect 6f jurisdiction as to any thing that was done.
Beyond this we need not look into the record. Whatever
wai done, that the court could do under any circumstances, we
must presume was properly done. If error was committed in
the rightful exercise of authority, we cannot correct it.
A writ of habeas corlpus cannot be ihade to perform the functions of a writ of error. To warrant the discharge of the
petitioner, the sentence under which he is held must be, not
merely erroneous and voidable, but absolutely toid. Ex parte
