Mni. JUSTICE BnADL-nY delivered the opinion of the court.
This case comes before us on the return to a writ of habeas
corpus, issued by order of one of the justices of this court. The
petition for a habeas corpus was addressed to the judges of the
Supreme Court of the United States by Augustus F. Clarke,
who states therein that he is a member of the city council of
Cincinnati, and, as such, one of the judges of election of precinct A in said city; in which capacity he acted at the State,
congressional, county, and municipal elections held in said city
in October, 1878. That on the 24th of October, 1878, he was
indicted in the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of Ohio for unlawfully neglecting to perform
the duty required of him as such judge of election by the laws
of the State of Ohio in regard to said election, in this, that
having accepted one of the poll-books of said election, sealed
and directed according to law, for the purpose of conveying the
same to the clerk of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton
County, in said State, at his office, he neglected to do so; and,
in another count, that he permitted the said poll-books, sealed
and directed for the purpose aforesaid, to be broken open
before he conveyed the same to said clerk; that a motion to
quash said indictment, and a demurrer thereto, having been successively overruled, he pleaded not guilty, and at the February
Term, 1879, was tried and found guilty; and having unsuccessfully moved for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment. he was
sentenced by said court to be imprisoned in the jail of Hamilton County for twelve months, and to pay a fine of $200 and
the cost of .prosecution ; that in pursuance of said sentence he
had been arrested and imprisoned, and is now imprisoned
and restrained from his liberty by the marshal of the United
States for said district. The petition then asserts that the
said Circuit Court had no jurisdiction in the premises, and

that its acts were wholly void and his imprisonment unlawful. He,therefore, prays a habeas corpus to the said marshal,
and a certiorari to the clerk of said court, if necessary, and
that he may be discharged from custody. A certified copy
of the indictment, proceedings, and judgment in the Circuit
Court is annexed to the petition, from which it appears that
the first count charged that the petitioner on the 9th of October,
1878, in the county of Hamilton, in the State of Ohio, being
an officer of election at which a representative in Congress was
voted for, to wit, a judge of said election at precinct A of the
eighth ward of Cincinnati, and being duly appointed such
judge of election under the laws of Ohio, did unlawfully
neglect to perform a duty required of him by the laws of said
State in regard to said election, specifying said neglect, to wit,
that he neglected to convey the poll-book to the county clerk,
which had been sealed up by the judges and delivered to him
for that purpose; contrary to the form of the statute and
against the peace and dignity of the United States. The second count charged that the petitioner, as such judge of election,
violated a duty required of him by the laws of said State in
regard to said election, specifying the violation, namely, that
having received the poll-book in the manner and for the purpose aforesaid, he permitted it to be broken open before he
conveyed it to the county clerk, contrary to the form of the
statute, &c.
It is conceded that this indictment was found under sect.
5515 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, which is in
the following words: [This section is set forth in .Ex Tarts
,Siebold, supra, pp. 371, 381.]
The law of Ohio which the petitioner is charged with violating is as follows : "(32.) SECT. IX. That, after canvassing the votes in the manner aforesaid, the judges, before they disperse, shall put under
cover one of the poll-books, seal the same, and direct it to the clerk
of the Court of Common Pleas of the county wherein the return is
to be made; andathe poll-book, thus sealed and directed, shall be
conveyed by one of the judges (to be determined by lot if they
cannot agree otherwise) to the clerk of the Court of Common Pleas
of the county, at his office, within two days from the day of the

election; and the other poll-book, where the same is not otherwise
disposed of by this act, shall be deposited with the township clerk,
or clerk of the election district (as the case may be), within three
days fiom the day of election, there to remain for the use of the
persons who may choose to inspect the same."
On the thirty-first day of July, 1879, the said petition was
presented to Mr. Justice Strong, and a writ of habeas corpus
was allowed by him, returnable forthwith before himself, at the
Catskill Mountain House, in the State of New York. On
the 11th of August, 1879, return being made of the body of
the petitioner according to the command of the writ, with a
copy of the judgment of the Circuit Court, and the warrant of
commitment issued thereon, Justice Strong made an order postponing the hearing of the cause into this court, to be heard
upon the second Tuesday of October, 1879 (being the first day
of the present term), and admitted the petitioner to bail in the
sum of $5,000 to abide the rule of the Supreme Court in the
premises.
The case was argued at the same time with Ez parte Slebold,
supra, p. 871; and most of the questions involved have been
considered in that case.
One question, however, has been raised by the counsel for
the government which it is necessary to consider. It is objected
that this court cannot proceed upon a writ of habeas corpus
which was originally presented to a justice of this court, and
was postponed and referred by him to the court for its determination.
We have considered this point with some care, inasmuch as
in Kaine's Case, reported in 14 How. 103, the court held that
it could not act upon a writ thus referred to it by Mr. Justice
Nelson. But the ground taken there was, that the writ had
been issued by him in virtue of his original jurisdiction;
though the.court was of opinion that it could issue a new writ
upon the papers before it in virtue of its own appellate jurisdiction, and would do so if the case required it; but being of
opinion that there was no case on the merits the application
was discharged. But in this case, however it may have been
in that, it is clear that the writ, whether acted upon by the
justice who issued it, or by this court, would in fact require a

revision of the action of the Circuit Court by which the petitioner was committed, and such revision would necessarily be
appellate in its character. This appellate character of the
proceeding attaches to a large portion of cases on habeas corpus,
whether issued by a single judge or by a court. The presence
of this feature in the case was no objection to the issue of the
writ by the associate justice, and is essential to the jurisdiction of this court. The justice who issued it could undoubtedly have disposed of the case himself, though not, at the
time, within his own circuit. A justice of this court can exercise the power of issuing the writ of habeas corpus in any part
of the United States where he happens to be. But as the
case is one of which this court also has jurisdiction, if the
justice who issued the writ found the questions involved to be
of great moment and difficulty, and could postpone the case
here for consideration of the whole court without injury to the
petitioner, we see no good reason why he should not have
taken this course, as he did. It had merely the effect-of
making the application for a discharge one addressed to the
court, instead of one addressed to a single justice. This has
always been the practice of English judges in cases of great
.consequence and difficulty, and we do not see why it may
not be done here. Under the Habeas Corpus Act, indeed, it
was the regular course to take bail and recognize-the party to
appear in the King's Bench or assizes; though the judge would
discharge absolutely if the case was clearly one of illegal
imprisonment. Hab. Corp.-Act, sect. 3; Com. Dig., Hab.
Corp. F.; Bac; Abr., Hab. Corp. B. 13; 1 Chitty, Gen. Pr.

injury will be thereby incurred by the petitioner. No injury
can be complained of in this case, since the petitioner was
allowed to go at large on reasonable bail.
As to the merits of the case, there can be no serious question
that the indictment charges an offence specified in the act of

cipal question is, whether Congress had constitutional power
to enact a law for punishing a State officer of election for the
violation of his duty under a State statute in reference to an
election of a representative to Congress. As this question has
been fully considered in the previous case, it is unnecessary to
add any thing further on the subject. Our opinion is, that
Congress had constitutional power to enact the law; and that
the cause of commitment was lawful and sufficient.
The petitioner, therefore, must be remanded to the custody
of the marshal for the Southern District of Ohio; and it is
So ordered.
MR. JUSTICE

FIELD, -with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE

dissenting.
I cannot assent to the decision of the majority of the court
in this and the preceding case, and I will state the reasons of
my dissent. One of the six petitioners is a citizen of Ohio,
and the other five are citizens of Maryland. They all seek a
discharge from imprisonment imposed by judgments of Federal
courts for alleged official misconduct as 'judges of election in
their respective States.
. At an election held in the first congressional district of
Ohio, in October, 1878, at which a representative in Congress
was voted for, the petitioner from that State was appointed
under its laws, and acted as a judge of election at a precinct
in one of the wards of the city of Cincinnati. At an election
held in the fourth and fifth congressional districts of Maryland,
in November, 1878, at which a representative in Congress was
voted for, the petitioners from that State were appointed under
its laws, and acted as judges of election at different precincts
in the wards of the city of Baltimore. For alleged misconduct
as such officers of election the petitioners were indicted in the
Circuit Courts of the United States for their respective districts, tried, convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment for
twelve months, and, in some of the cases, also to pay a fine.
In what I have to say I shall confine myself principally to
the case of the petitioner from Ohio; the other cases will be
incidentally considered. In that case, the petitioner is charged
with having violated a law of the State. In the cases from
CLIFFORD,

Oct. 1879.]

EX PARTE CLARKE.

Maryland, the petitioners are charged with having prevented
Federal officers from interfering with them and supervising
their action in the execution of the laws of the State. The
principle which governs one will dispose of all of them; for if
Congress cannot punish an officer of a State for the manner in
which he discharges his duties under her laws, it cannot subject him to the supervision and control of others in the performance of such duties, and punish him for resisting their
interference. In the cases from MAaryland, it appears that the
laws of the State under which the petitioners were appointed
judges of election, and the registration of voters for the election
of -1878 was made, were not in existence when the act of Congress was passed providing for the appointment of supervisors
to examine the regstration and scrutinize the lists, and of
special deputy marshals to aid and protect them. The act of
Congress was passed in 1871, and republished in the Revised
Statutes, which are declaratory of the law in force, Dec. 1,
1873. The law of Maryland, under which the registration of
voters was had, was enacted in 1874, and the law under which
the judges of election were appointed was enacted in 1876, and
these judges were required to possess different qualifications
from those required of judges of election in 1871 and 1873.
In all the cases the petitioners are imprisoned under the
judgments against them; and each one insisting that the Circuit Court, in his case, acted without jurisdiction, and that his
imprisonment is, therefore, unlawful and subversive of his
rights as a citizen, has petitionied this court for a writ of
7tabeas corpus, annexing to his petition a transcript of th
record of the proceedings against him; and prays that he may
be released from restraint.
It has been settled by this court that the writ of habea8
corpus is one of the modes by which its appellate jurisdiction
will be exercised in cases where it is alleged that by the action
of an inferior tribunal a citizen of the United States has been
unlawfully deprived of his personal liberty; and, if necessary,
that a certiorariwill be issued with the writ to bring up for
examination the record of the proceedings of the inferior
tribunal. In such cases, we look into that record to see, not
whether the court erred in its rulings, but whether it had

EX PARTE CLARKE.

[Sup. Ct.

jurisdiction to impose the imprisonment complained of. If it
had jurisdiction, our examination ends, and the case must
await determination in the ordinary course of procedure on
wyrit of error or appeal, should the case be one which can thus
be brought under our review. But if the court below was
without jurisdiction of the matter upon which the judgment of
imprisonment was rendered, or if it exceeded its jurisdiction in
the exteht of the imprisonment imposed, this court will interfere and discharge the petitioner. If, therefore, the act of
Congress, in seeking to impose a punishment upon a State
officer in one of these cases for disobeying a law of the State,
and in the other cases for resisting the interference of Federal
officials with the discharge of his duties under such law, is
unconstitutional and void, the judgments of the circuit courts
are unlawful and the petitioners should be released.
I do not regard the presentation by the petitioner from Ohio
of his petition to one of the justices of the court in the first
instance as a fact at all affecting his case. His petition is addressed to this court, and though the justice, who allowed the
writ, directed that it should be returnable before himself, he
afterwards ordered the hearing upon it to be had before this
court. The petition may, therefore, with propriety be treated
as if presented to us in the first instance. Irregularities in
that regard should not be allowed to defeat its purpose, the
writ being designed for the security of the personal liberty of
the citizen.
The act of Congress upon which the indictment of the petitioner from Ohio was founded is contained in sect. 6515 of
the Revised Statutes, which declares that "every officer of an
election, at which any representative or delegate in Congress
is voted for, whether such officer of election be appointed or
created by or under any law or authority of the United States,
or by or under any State, territorial, district, or municipal law
or authority, who neglects or refuses to perform any duty in
regard to such election required of him by any law of the
United States, or of any State or Territory thereof; or who
violates any duty so imposed; or who knowingly does any acts
thereby unauthorized with intent to affect any such election or
the result thereof, . . .shall be punished as prescribed" in a

previous section, that is, by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or
imprisonment hot more than one year, or by both.
The indictment contains three counts, the third of which
was abandoned. The first count charges unlawful neglect on
the part of the accused to perform a duty required of him by
the laws of the State, in not carrying to the clerk of the Court
of Common Pleas one of the poll-books of the election, covered
and sealed by the judges of election, with which he was intrusted by them for that purpose. The second count charges
the violation of a duty required of him by the laws of the
State in permitting one of the poll-books, covered and sealed,
intrtsted to him by the judges of election to carry to the clerk
of-the Court of Common Pleas, to be broken open before he
ronveyed it to that officer.
The law of Ohio, to which reference is had in the indictment, provides that after the votes at an election are canvassed
"the judges, before they disperse, shall put under cover one of
the poll-books, seal the same, and direct it to the clerk of the
Court of Common Pleas of the county wherein the return is to
be made; and the poll-book thus sealed and directed, shall be
conveyed by one of the judges (to be determined by lot if they
zannot agree otherwise), to the clerk of the Court of Common
Pleas of the county, at his office, within two days from the day
of the election."
The provisions of the act of Congress relating to the appointment of supervisors of election, the powers with which they
are intrusted, and the aid to bb rendered them by marshals
and special deputy marshals, for resisting and interfering with
whom the petitioners from Maryland have been condemned
and are imprisoned, are stated in the opinion of the court. It
is sufficient to observe that they authorize the supervisors to
supervise the action of the State officers from the registration
of voters down to the close of the polls on the day of election;
require the marshals to aid and protect them, and provide for
the appointment of special deputy marshals in towns and cities
of over twenty thousand inhabitants; and they invest those
Federal officers with a power to arrest and take into custody
persons without process more extended than has ever before in
our country in time of peace been intrusted to any one.

EX PARTE CLARKE.

[Sup: OL

In what I have to say I shall endeavor to show; 1st, that it
is not competent for Congress to punish a State officer for the
manner in which he discharges duties imposed upon him by
the laws of the State, or to subject him in the performance of
such duties to the supervision and control of others, and punish
him for resisting their interference; and, 2d, that it is no
competent for Congress to make the exercise of its punitive
power dependent upon the legislation of the States.
There is no doubt that Congress may adopt a law of a State,
but in that case the adopted law must be enforced as a law of
the United States. Here there is no pretence of such adoption. In the case from Ohio it is for the violation of a State
law, not a law of the United States, that the indictment was
found. The judicial power of the United States does not
extend to a case of that kind. The Constitution defines and
limits that power. It declares that it shall extend to cases
in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of
the United States, and treaties made under their authority;
to cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and to
various controversies to which the United States or a State is
a party, or between citizens of different States, or citizens of
the same State claiming lands under grants of different States,
or between citizens of a State and any foreign State, citizens
or subjects. The term "controversies " as here used refers to
such only as are of a civil as distinguished from those of a
criminal nature. The judicial power thus defined may be
applied to new cases as they arise under the Constitution and
laws of the United States, but it cannot be enlarged by Congress so as to embrace cases not enumerated in the Constitution. It hps been so held by this court from the earliest
period. It was so adjudged in 1803 in .Marbury v. lladison,
and the adjudication has been affirmed in numerous instances
since. This limitation upon Congress would seem to be conclusive of the case from Ohio. To authorize a criminal prosecution in the Federal courts for an offence against a law of a
State is to extend the judicial power of the United States
to a case not arising under the Constitution or laws of the
United States.

CLARKE.

But there is another view of this subject which is equally
conclusive against the jurisdiction of the Federal court. The
act of Congress asserts a power inconsistent with, and destractive of, the independence of the States. The right to control
their own officers, to prescribe the duties they shall perform,
without the supervision or interference of any other authority,
and tha penalties to which they shall be subjected for a violation of duty is essential to that independence. If the Federal
government can punish a violation of the laws of the State, it
may punish obedience to them, and graduate the punishment
according to its own judgment of their propriety and wisdom.
It may thus exercise a control over the legislation of the States
subversive of all their reserved rights. However large the
powers conferred upon the government formed by the Constitution, and however numerous its restraints, the right to
enforce their own laws by such sanctions as they may deem
appropriate is left, where it was originally, with the States.
It is a right which has never been surrendered. Indeed a
State could not be considered as independent in any matter,
with respect to which its officers, in the discharge of their
duties, could be subjected to punishment by any external authority; nor in which its officers, in the execution of its laws,
could be subject to the supervision and interference of others.
The invalidity of coercive measures by the United States, to
compel an officer of a State to perform a duty imposed upon
him by a law of Congress, is asserted in explicit terms in the
case of Te Cornmonwealth of Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How.
66. The Constitution declares that "a person charged in any
State with treason, felony, or other crime, who shall flee from
justice, and be found in another State, shall, on demand of the
executive authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up to be removed to the State having jurisdiction of the
crime." And the act of Congress of 1798, to give effect to
this clause, made it the duty of the executive authority of the
State, upon the demand mentioned, and the production of a
properly authenticated copy of the indictment or affidavit
charging the person demanded with the commission of treason,
felony, or other crime, to surrender the fugitive. The Governor of Ohio having refused upon a proper demand to sur-

410

PARTE CLARKE.

[Sup, Ct.

render a fugitive from justice from Kentucky, the Governor
of the latter State applied to this court for a mandamus to
compel the performance of that duty. But the court, after
observing that, though the words, "it shall be the duty," in
ordinary legislation implied the assertion of the power to command and to cause obedience, said, that looking to the subjectmatter of the law and "the relations which the United States
and the several States hear to each other," it was of opinion
that the words were not used as mandatory and compulsory,
but as declaratory of the moral duty created, when Congress
had provided the mode of carrying the provision into execution. "The act does not provide," the court added, "any
means to compel the execution of this duty, nor inflict any
punishment for neglect or refusal on the part of the executive
of the State; nor is there any clause or provision in the Constitution which arms the government of the United States
with this power. Indeed, such a power would place every
State under the control and dominion of the general government, even in the administration of its internal concerns and
reserved rights. And we think it clear that the Federal
government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose
on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him
to perform it; for if it possessed this power it might overload
the officer with duties which would fill up all his time, and
disable him from performing his obligations to the State and
might impose on him duties of a character incompatible with
the rank and dignity to which he was elevated by the State.
It is true that Congress may authorize a particular State officer
to perform a particular duty; but if he declines to do so, it
does not follow that he may be coerced or punished for his
refusal. And we are very far from supposing that in using
this word 'duty,' the statesmen who framed and passed the
law, or the President who approved and signed it, intended to
exercise a coercive power over State officers, not warranted by
the Constitution." And again: "If the Governor of Ohio
refuses to discharge this duty, there is no power delegated to
the general government, either through the judicial department or any other department, to use any coercive means to
compel him."

Oct. 1879. ]

EX PARTE OLARKE.

If it be incompetent for the Federal government to enforce by
coercive measures the performance of a plain duty, imposed by a
law of Congress upon the executive officer of a State, it would
seem to be equally incompetent for it to enforce by similar
measures the performance of a duty imposed upon him by a
law of a State. If Congress cannot impose upon a State officer, as such, the performance of any duty, it would seem logically to follow that it cannot subject him to punishment for the
neglect of such duties as the State may impose. It cannot
punish for the non-performance of a duty which it cannot prescribe. It is a contfadiction in terms to say that it can inflict
punishment for disobedience to an act the performance of
which it has no constitutional power to command.
I am not aware that the doctrine of this case, which is so
essential to the harmonious working of the State and Federal
governments, has ever been qualified or departed from by this
court, until the recent decisions in the Virginia cases, of which
I shall presently speak. It is true that, at an early period in
the history of the government, laws were passed by Congress,
authorizing State courts to entertain jurisdiction of proceedings by the United States, to enforce penalties and forfeitures
under the revenue laws, and to hear allegations, and take
proofs, if application were made for their remission. To these
laws reference is made in the Kentucky case; and the court
observes that the powers which they conferred wei6 for some
years exercised by the State tribunals, without objection, until,
in some of the States, their exercise was declined, because it
interfered with and retarded the performance of duties which
properly belonged, to them as State courts, and in other States
because doubts arose as to the power of State courts to inflict
penalties and forfeitures for offences against the general government, unless specially authorized to do so by the States ; and
that the co-operatioii of the States in thoses cases was a matter
of comity which the several sovereignties extended to one another for their mutual benefit, and was not regarded by either
party as an obligation imposed by the Constitution.
It is to be observed that, by the Constitution, the demand for
the surrender of a fugitive is to be made by the executive authority of the State from which he has fled; but it is not

declared uponwhom the demand shall be made. That was left
to be determined by Congress ; and it provided that the demand should be made upon the executive of the State where
the fugitive was found. It might have employed its own
agents, as in the enforcement of the fugitive-slave law, and
compelled them to act. But, in both cases, if it employed the
officers of the State, it could not restrain nor coerce them.
Whenever, therefore, the Federal government, instead of
acting through its own officers, seeks to accomplish its pur.poses through the agency of officers of the States, it must
accept the agency with the conditions upon which the officers
are permitted to act. For example, the Constitution invests
Congress with the "power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization ;" and this power, from its nature, is exclusive. A
concurrent power in the Stats would prevent the uniformity
of regulations required on the subject.
Chirac v. Chirac,
2 Wheat. 259; The Federalist, No. 42. Yet Congress, in
legislating under this power, has authorized courts of record of
the States to receive declarations under oath by aliens of their
intention to become citizens, and to admit them to citizenship,
after a limited period of residence, upon satisfactory proof as to
character and attachment to the Constitution. But, when Congress prescribed the conditions and proof upon which aliens
might, by the action of the State courts, become citizens, its
power ended. It could not coerce the State courts to hold sessions for such applications, nor fix the time when they should
hear the applicants, nor the manner in which they should administer the required oaths, nor regulate in any way their
procedure. It could not compel them to act by )mandamus
from its own tribunals, nor subject their judges to criminal
prosecution for their non-action. It could accept the agency of
those courts only upon such terms as the States should prescribe. The same thing is true in all cases where the agency
of State officers is used; 'and this doctrine applies with special
force to judges of elections, at which numerous State officers
are chosen at the same time with representatives to Congress.
So far as the election of State officers and the registration of
voters for their election are concerned, tlh Federal government

vision of and interference with the State regulations, sanctioned by the act of Congress, when representatives to
Congress are voted for, .amount practically to a supervision
of and an interference with the election of State officers, and
constitute a plain encroachment upon the rights of the States,
which is well calculated to create irritation towards the Federal
government, and disturb the harmony that all good and patriotic men should desire to exist between it and the State
governments.
It was the purpose of the framers of the Constitution to
create a government which could enforce its own laws, through
its own officers and tribunals, without reliance upon those of
the States, and thus avoid the principal defect of the government of the confederation, and they fully accomplished their
purpose; for, as said by Chief Justice Marshall, in the MeCullough Cae, "No trace is to be found in the Constitution of
an intention to create a dependence of the Federal government
on the governments of the States for the execution of the great
powers assigned to it. Its means are adequate to its ends; and
on those means alone was it expected to rely for the accomplishment of its ends." When, therefore, the Federal government
desires to compel by coercive measures and punitive sanctions
the performance of any duties devolved upon it by the Constitution, it must appoint its own officers and agents, upon whom
its power can be exerted. If it sees fit to intrust the performance of such duties to officers of a State, it must take their
agency, as already stated, upon the conditions which the State
may impose. The co-operative scheme to which the majority
of the court give their sanction, by which the general government may create one condition and the States another, and
each make up for and supplement the omissions or defects in
the legislation of the other, touching the same subject, with its
separate penalties for the same offence, and thus produce a
harmonious mosaic of statutory regulation, does not appear to
have struck the great jurist as a feature in our system of gov
eminent or one that had been sanctioned by its founders.
It is true that, since the recent amendments of the Constitu
tion, there has been legislation by Congress asserting, as in the
instance before us. a direct control over State officers, which

previously was never supposed to be compatible with -the independent existence of the States in their reserved powers.
Much of that legislation has yet to be brought to the test of
judicial examination; and, until the recent aecisions in the
Virginia cases, I could not have believed that the former carefully considered and repeated judgments of this court upon
provisions of the Constitution, and upon the general character
and purposes of that instrument, would have been disregarded
and overruled. These decisions do indeed, in my judgment,
,constitute a new departure. They give to the Federal government the power to strip the States of the right to vindicate
their authority in their own courts against a violator of their
laws, when the transgressor happens to be an officer of the
United States, or alleges that he is denied or cannot enforce
some right under their laws. And they assert for the Federal
government a power to subject a judicial officer of a State to
punishment for the manner in which he discharges his duties
under her laws. The power to punish at all existing, the nature
and extent of the punishment must depend upon the will of
Congress, and may be carried to a removal from office. In my
judgment, - and I say it without intending any disrespect to
my associates, - no such advance has ever before been made
toward the conversion of our Federal system into a consolidated and centralized government. I cannot think that those
who framed and advocated, and the States which adopted the
amendments, contemplated any such fundamental change in our
theory of government as those decisions indicate. Prohibitions
against legislation on particular subjects previously existed, as, for instance, against passing a bill of attainder and an
ex post facto law, or a law impairing the obligation of contracts; and, in enforcing those prohibitions, it was never supposed that criminal prosecutions could be authorized against
members of the State legislature for passing the prohibited
laws, or against members of the State judiciary for sustaining
them, or against executive officers for enforcing the judicial

asserted. In few instances could legislation by Congress be
deemed appropriate for their enforcement, which should provide for the annulment of prohibited laws in any other way
than through the instrumentality of an appeal to the judiciary,
when they impinged upon the rights of parties. If in any
instance there could be such legislation authorizing a criminal
prosecution for disregarding a prohibition, that legislation
should define the offence and declare the punishment, and not
invade the independent action of the different departments
of the State governments within their appropriate spheres.
Legislation by Congress can neither be necessary nor appropriate which would subject to criminal prosecution State officers for the performance of duties prescribed by State laws,
not having for their object the forcible subversion of the
government.
The clause of the Constitution, upon which reliance was
placed by counsel, on the argument, for the legislation in question, does not, as it seems to me, give the slightest support to
it. That clause declares that "the times, places, and manner
of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be
prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof; but the
Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing senators." The power
of Congress thus conferred is either to alter the regulations
prescribed by the State or to make new ones; the alteration or
new creation embracing every particular of time, place, and
manner, except the place of choosing senators. But in neither
mode nor in any respect has Congress interfered with the regulations prescribed by the legislature of Ohio, or with those
prescaibed by the legislature of Maryland. It has not altered
them, nor made new ones. It has simply provided for the
appointment of officers to supervise the execution of the State
laws, and of marshals to aid and protect them in such supervision, and has added a new penalty for disobeying those laws.
This is not enforcing an altered or a new regulation. Whatever Congress may properly do touchiig the regulations, one
of two things must follow; either the altered or the new regulation remains a State law, or it becomes a law of Congress.
If it remain a State law, it must, like other laws of the State,

EX PARTE CLARKE.

[Sup. Ct,

be enforced, through its instrumentalities and agencies, and
with the penalties which it may see fit to prescribe, and without
the supervision or interference of Federal officials. If, on the
other hand, it become a law of Congress, it must be carried
into execution by such officers and with such sanctions as Congress may designate. But as Congress has not altered the regulations for the election of representatives prescribed by the
legislature of Ohio or of Maryland, either as to time, place, or
manner, nor adopted any regulations of its own, there is nothing
for the Federal government to enforce on the subject. The
general authority of Congress to pass all laws necessary to carry
into execution its granted powers, supposes some attempt to
exercise those powers. There must, therefore, be some regulations made by Congress, either by altering those prescribed
by the State, or by adopting entirely new ones, as to the times,
places, and manner of holding elections for representatives,
before any incidental powers can be invoked to compel obedience to them. In other words, the implied power cannot be
invoked until some-exercise of the express power is attempted,
and then only to aid its execution. There is no express power
in Congress to enforce State laws by imposing penalties for
disobedience to them; its punitive power' is only implied as a
necessary or proper means of enforcing its own laws; nor is
there any power delegated to it to supervise the execution by
State officers of State laws.
If this view be correct, there is no power in Congress, independently of all other considerations, to authorize the appointment of supervisors and other officers to superintend and interfere
with the election of representatives under the laws of Ohio and
Maryland, or to annex a penalty to the violation of those laws,
and the action of the circuit courts was without jurisdiction
and void. The act of Congress in question was passed, as it
seems to me, in disregard of the object of the constitutional
provision. That was designed simply to give to the general
government the means of its own preservation against a possible
dissolution from the hostility of the States to the election of
representatives, or from their neglect to provide suitable means
for holding such elections. This is evident from the language
of its advocates, some of them members of the convention, when

Oct. 1879.]

the Constitution was presented to the country for adoption.
In commenting upon it in his report of the debates, Mr. Madison
said that it was meant "to give the national legislature a power
not only to alter the provisions of the States, but to make regulations, in case the States should fail or refuse altogether."
Elliott's Debates, 402. And in the Virginia convention called
to consider the Constitution, he observed that "it was found
impossible to fix the time, place, and manner of the election of
representatives ia the Constitution. It was found necessary to
leave the regulation of these, in the first place, to the State
governments, as being best acquainted with the situation of the
people, subject to the control of the general government, in
order to enable it to produce uniformity and prevent its own
dissolution." 3 id. 367. And in the Federalist, Hamilton said,
that the propriety of the clause in question rested "upon the
evidence of the plain proposition that every government should
contain in itself the means of its own preservation."
Similar language is found in the debates in conventions of
the other States and in the writings of jurists and statesmen of
the period. The conduct of Rhode Island was referred to as
illustrative of the evils to be avoided. That State was not
represented by delegates in Congress for years, owing to the
character and views of the prevailing party; and Congress was
often embarrassed by their absence. The same evil, it was
urged, might result from a similar cause, and Congress should,
therefore, possess the power to give the people an opportunity
of electing representatives if the States should neglect or refuse
to make the necessary regulations.
In the conventions of several States which ratified the Constitution an amendment was proposed to limit in express terms
the action of Congress to cases of neglect or refusal of a State
to make proper provisions for congressional elections, and was
supported by a majority of the thirteen States; but it was
finally abandoned upon the ground of the great improbability
of congressional interference so long as the States performed
their duty. When Congress does interfere and provide regulations, the duty of rendering them effectual, so far as they
may require affirmative action, will devolve solely upon the
Federal government. It will then be Federal power which is

to be exercised, and its enforcement, if promoted by punitive
sanctions, must be through Federal officers and agents ; for, as
said by Mr. Justice Story in Prigg v. Pennsylvania, " The
national government, in the absence of all positive provisions
to the contrary, is bound, through- its own proper department,
legislative, judicial, or executive, as the case may require, to
carry into effect all the rights and duties imposed upon it by
the Constitution." If State officers and State agents are employed, they must be taken, as already said, with the conditions
upon which the States may permit them to act, and without
responsibility to the Federal authorities. The power vested in
Congress is to alter the regulations prescribed by the legislatures of the States, or to make new ones, as to the times, places,
and manner of holding the elections. Those which relate to
the times and places will seldom require any affirmative action
beyond their designation. And regulations as to the manner
of holding them cannot extend beyond the designation cf the
mode in which the will of the voters shall be expressed and
ascertained. The power does not authorize Congress to determine who shall participate in the election, or what shall be the
qualification of voters. These are matters not pertaining to or
involved in the manner of holding the election, and their regulation rests exclusively with the States. The only restriction
upon them with respect to these matters is found. in the provision that the electors of representatives in Congress shall
have the qualifications required "for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature, and the provision relating
to the suffrage of the colored race. And whatever regulations
Congress may prescribe as to the manner of holding the election
for representatives must be so framed as to leave the election
of State officers free, otherwise they cannot be maintained. In
one of the numbers of the Federalist, Mr. Hamilton, in defending the adoption of the clause in the Constitution, uses this
language: "Suppose an article had been introduced into the
Constitution empowering the United States to regulate the
elections for the particular States, would any man have hesitated
to condemn it, both as an unwarrantable transposition of power,
and as a premeditated engine for the destruction of the State
governments? The violation of principle in this case would
-

Oet. 1879.]

have required no comment." By the act of Congress sustained
by the court, an interference with State elections is authorized
almost as destructive of their control by the States as the direct
regulation which he thought no man would hesitate to condemn.
The views expressed derive further support from the fact
that the constitutional provision applies equally to the election
of senators, except as to the place of choosing them, as it does
to the election of representatives. It will not be pretended
that Congress could authorize the appointment of supervisors
to examine the roll of members of State legislatures and pass
upon the validity of their titles, or to scrutinize the balloting
for senators; or could delegate to special deputy marshals the
power to arrest any member resisting and repelling the interference of the supervisors. But if Congress can authorize such
officers to interfere with the judges of election appointed under
State laws in the discharge of their duties when representatives are voted for, it can authorize such officers to interfere
with members of the State legislatures when senators are voted
for. The language of the Constitution conferring power upon
Congress to alter the regulations of the States, or to make new
regulations on the subject, is as applicable in the one case as
in the other. The objection to such legislation'in both cases
is that State officers are not responsible to the Federal government for the manner in which they perform their duties, nor
subject to its control. Penal sanctions and coercive measures
by Federal law cannot be enforced against them. Whenever,
as in some instances is the case, a State officer is required by
the Constitution to perform a duty, the manner of which may
be prescribed by Congress, as in the election of senators by
members of State legislatures, those officers are responsible
lonly to their States for their official conduct. The Federal
government cannot touch them. There are remedies for their
disregard of its regulations, which can be applied without interfering with their official character as State officers. Thus if
its regulations for the election of senators should not be followed, the election had in disregard of them might be invalidated; but no one, however extreme in his views, would
contend that in such a case the members of the legislature

EX PARTE CLARKE.

(Sup. Ct.

could be subjected to criminal prosecution for their action.
With respect to the election of representatives, so long as Congress does not adopt regulations of its own and enforce them
through Federal officers, but permits the regulations of the
States to remain, it must depend for a compliance with them
upon the fidelity of the State officers and their responsibility
to their own government. All the provisions of the law, therefore, authorizing supervisors and marshals to interfere with
those officers in the discharge of their duties, and providing
for criminal prosecutions against them in the Federal courts,
are, in my judgment, clearly in conflict with the Constitution.
The law was adopted, no doubt, with the object of preventing
frauds at elections for members of Congress, but it does not
seem to have occurred to its authors that the States are as
much interested as the general government in guarding against
frauds at those elections and in maintaining their purity, and,
if possible, more so, as their principal officers are elected at the
same time. If fraud be successfully perpetrated in any case,
they will be the first and the greatest sufferers. They are
invested with the sole power to regulate domestic affairs of the
highest moment to the prosperity and happiness of their people, affecting the acquisition, enjoyment, transfer, and descent
of property; the marriage relation, and the education of children; and if such momentous and vital concerns may be wisely
and safely intrusted to them, I do not think that any apprehension need be felt if the supervision of all elections in their
respective States should also be left to them.
Much has been said in argument of the power of the general
government to enforce its own laws, and in so doing to preserve
the peace, though it is not very apparent what pertinency the
observations have to the questions involved in the cases before,
us. No one will deny that in the powers granted to it the general government is supreme, and that, upon all subjects within
their scope, it can make its authority respected and obeyed
throughout the limits of the Republic; and that it can repress
all disorders and disturbande which interfere with the enforcement of its laws. But I am unable to perceive in this fact,
which all sensible men acknowledge, any cause for the exercise
of ungranted power. The greater its lawful -power, the greater

the reason for not usurping more. Unrest, disquiet, and disturbance will always arise among a people, jealous of their
rights, from the exercise by the general government of powers
which they have reserved to themselves or to the States.
My second proposition is that it is not competent for Congress to make the exercise of its punitive power dependent
upon the legislation of the States. The act upon which the
indictment of the petitioner from Ohio is founded makes the
neglect or violation of a duty prescribed by a law of the State

of any duty prescribed by any law of

changing laws of the State; but its penalty is to be shifted
with the shifting humors of the State legislatures. I cannot
think that such primitive legislation is valid, which varies, not
by direction of the F~deral legislators, upon new knowledge or
larger experience, but by the direction of some external authority which makes the same act lawful in one State and cr, ninal
in another, not according to the views of Congress as to its opriety, but to those of another body. The Constitution ve- "
all the legislative power of the Federal government in Congress; and from its nature this power cannot be delegated to
others, except as its delegation may be involved by the creation
w" an inferior local government or department. Congress can
endow territorial governments and municipal corporations with
legislative powers, as the possession of such powers for certain
purposes of local administration is indispensable to their existence. So, also, it can invest the heads of departments and of
the army and navy with power to prescribe regulations to enforce discipline, order, and efficiency. Its possession is implied
in their creation; but legislative power over subjects which
come under the immediate control of Congress, such as defining offences against the United States, and prescribing punishment for them cannot be delegated to any other government or
authority. Congress cannot, for example, leave to the States
the enactment of laws and restrict the United States to their

BX PARTE CLARKE.

Lbup. Ct.

enforcement. There are many citizens of the United States in
foreign countries, in Japan, China, India, and Africa. Could
Congress enact that a crime against one of those States should be
punished as a crime against the United States? Can Congress
abdicate its functions and delpute foreign countries to act for
it? If Congress cannot do this with respect to offences against
those States, how can it enforce penalties for offences against
any other States, though they be of our own Union? If Congress could depute its authority in this way; if it could say
that it will punish as an offence what another power enacts as
such, it might do the same thing with respect to the commands
of any other authority, as, for example, of the President or the
head of a department. It could enact that what the President
proclaims shall be law; that'what he declares to be offences
shall be punished as such. Surely no one will go so far as
this, and yet I am unable to see the distinction in principle
between the existing law and the one I suppose, which seems
so extravagant and absurd.
I will not pursue the subject further, but those who deem
this question at all doubtful or difficult, may find something
worthy of thought in the opinions of the Court of Appeals
of New York and of the supreme courts of several other
States, where this subject is treated with a fulness and learning, which leaves nothing to be improved and nothing to be
added.
-I am of opinion that the act of Congress was unauthorized and invalid; that the indictment of the petitioner from
Ohio, and also the indictments of the petitioners from Maryland, and their imprisonment, are illegal, and that, therefore,
they should all be set at liberty.
