(COSTITUTIONAL LAW.)
M'MILLAN V. M'NEILL,

A State bankrupt or insolvent law, (which not oniy literates the perl
son of the debtof, but discharges him from all liability forthe debt,)
so far as it attempts to discharge the contract, is repugnant to the
constitution of the United States; and it makes no difference in the
npplication of this principle, whether the law.was passed before or
after the debt was contracted.'
A disclharge under a foreign bankrupt law is no bar to an action, ill
the Courts of this country, on a contract made hae.

to the District Court of Louisiana.
This was a suit brought by M'Neill the plaintiff
below, against M'Millan, the defendant below, to recover a sum of money paid for the defend ant's'use
under the followinig circumstances: M'Millan, residing in Charleston, South Carolina, trinsacting
business there as a partner of the house of trade of
S]oane & M'Millan, of Liverpool, on the 8th of
October and 9th of November, 1811, imported foreign merchandise, on which he gave bonds at th6
custom house, with. MINeill and one Walton, as sureties. These bonds were payable the 8th of April, and
9th of May, 1812, and were paid, after suit and judgment, by M'Neill, on the 23d of August and 23d of
September, 1813. Some time afterwards, M'Millan
removed to New-Orleans; where, on the 23d of August) 1815, the District Court of the first district of
the State of Louisiana, having previously:taken into

SLouisiana, passed in 1808, praying for the benefit of

MMilanv. the cessio bonorum, and a full and entire release and
MNeiU. discharge, as well in his person as property, from all

debts, dues, claims, and obligations, then existing,
due, or owing by him, the said M'Millan, and it having appeared fully and satisfactorily, that the requisite proportion of his creditors, as well in number as
amount, had accepted the cession of his goods, and
had granted a full and entire discharge, as well with
respect to his person as to his future effects, it was
then and there ordered, adjudged, and decreed, by the
said Court, that the proceedings be homologated and
confirmed, and that the said M'Millan be acquitted,
released, and discharged, as well his person as his future effects, from the payment of any and all debts,
dues, and demands, of whatever nature, due and
owing by him previous to the day of the date of the
commencement of said proceedings, to wit, previous
to the 12th day of August, 1815. The house of
trade of Sloane & M'Millan, of Liverpool, having
failed, a commission of bankruptcy issued against
both the partners in England, on the 28th of September, 1812, and on the 28th of November, 1812, they
both obtained certificates of discharge, signed 'by the
commissioners, and sanctioned by the requisite proportion of creditors in number and value, and confirmed by the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, according to the bankrupt laws of England. ' On the Ist of
July, 1817, the present suit was instituted by MINeill,
describing himself a a citizen of.South Carolina,
against M'Millan, described as a citizen of Louisiana,

court gave judgment for the plaintiff; from Which

v.
M'Neill.

This cause 'was argued by Mr. C. J. Ingersoll, for Feb. isth.
the plaintiff in error, no -counsel appearing for the
defendant in error. He contended, 1. That this case
was distinguishable from the preceding case of Sturges v. Crowninshield, because the State law, under
which the insolvent obtained his discharge, was passed long before the contract was made, and, therefore,
it could not be said to impair the obligation of a con'tract not then in existence. 2. That although the
contract was made in South Carolina, between parties who were at the time citizens of the State, yet
the debtor flaving removed to Louisiana, and become
a resident citizen of that State, and the creditor pursuing him'thither, the local Court had authority, under the local laws, to grant him a discharge, which
might be effectual within the limits of the State, even
if it had no extra-territorial operation. The discharge, being effectual in the Courts of the State
where it was obtained, would, of course, be equally
'effectual in the Courts of the United States, sitting
