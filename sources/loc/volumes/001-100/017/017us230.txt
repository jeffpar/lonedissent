Executors v.

HAMILTON.

Where the defendant in ejectment, for lands in North Carolina, has
been in possession under title in himself, and those inder whom he
claimed, for a period of seven years, or upwards, such possession is,
by the statute of limitations of North Carolina, a conclusive legal
bar against the action by an adverse claimant, unless such claimant
brings himself by positive proof within some of the disabilities provided for by that statute. In the absence of such proof, the title
shown by the party in possession is so complete as to prove, in an
action upon a covenant against incumbrances, that a recovery obtained by the adverse claimant was not by a paramount legal title.

only excepted." There was also a covenant for a
general warranty. Hamilton claimed the lands under a deed, dated the 4th of October, 1771, from one
Stewart, who was then in possession, and who delivered possession to Hamilton. John Somerville, the elder,
conveyed the same to his son, John Somerville, the
younger, by deed dated the 8th of September, 1777;
and Somerville, the younger, conveyed to one Whitmill Hill, by deed dated the 9th of October, 1795.
Y. Hill died on the 13th of October, 1797, having
by his last will devised the lands to his son Thbmas
B. Hill. The latter having entered under the devise, an action of ejectment was bro0ght against him

lands, by one Benjamin Sherrod, who, at the April

and judgment for the possession of the said two hundred and fifty acres of land, and was put in possession of the same. On the 2d of September, 1804,
Hamilton had notice from Somerville, the younger,
of the institution of this suit, but did not aid in the
defence. From the date of Stewart's deed to Ha-

The above facts were found by a special verdict

Court upon the special verdict at November term,

OF THE UNITED STATES.

The opinion of the Court was delivered at the
present term by Mr. Justice STORY. '
Upon'the special verdict in this case, the judges in
in opinion on two points,
the Court below differed ~Feb.
'which are certified to this Court for a final decision:
1. Whether the plaintiffs were bound to show that
Benjamin Sherrod recovered against Thomas B.
Hill by title paramount to that derived from Hamilton, or the recovery itself was prima facie evidence,
of that fact?
2. Whether the title shown by Thomas B. Hill
under Hamilton was not so complete as to prove
that Sherrod's recovery could not be by title paramount ?
Upon the first point, this Court also is divided in
opinion' anO, therefore, no decision can be certified.
But as we are unanimous on the second point, and
an opinion on that finally disposes of the cause, it
will now be pronounced.
From the date of Stewart's deed to Hamilton, in
October, 1771, until the commencement of the suit
by Sherrod against Hill, in June, 1804, a period -of
thirty-three years, the land in controversy was in the
exclusive possession of Hamilton, and those deriving
title under him. A possession for such a length of
time, under title, was, by the statute of limitations
of North Carolina, a conclusive bar against any suit
by any adverse claimant, unless he was within some
one of the exceptions or disabilities provided for by
that statute.a The special verdict in this case does

general principles of law, the party who seeks to
recover, upon the ground of his being Within some
exception of the statute of limitations, is bound to
establish such exception by proof, for it will not be
presumed by the law. In the suit by Sherrod against
Hill, it would have been sufficient for the defendant
to have relied upon the length of possession as a
statutable bar to the action ; and the burthen of proof
would have been upon Sherrod, to show that he was
excepted from its operation. By analogy to the rule
in that case, the proof of possession under title for
thirty-three years, was presumptive evidence, and,
in the absence of all conflicting evidence to remove
