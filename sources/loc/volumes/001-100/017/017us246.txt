CASES IN THE SUPREME COURT

section of the act of March 3d, 1801. By the former section, the Courts of the district are vested generally with jurisdiction of all causes in law and
equity ; and, by the latter, the clerks of the Circuit

Court are required to perform all the services then
performed by the clerks of the counties of the State
of Maryland. Among those services' is that of instituting a judicial proceeding in favour of this bank,
and the return of that process is required to be to
the Court with which such clerk is connected. That
Court has jurisdiction of all cases in law arising
in this district, and thus the suit is instituted by the
proper officer, by writ returnable to a Court having
a jurisdiction communicated by terms which admit
of no exception.
Upon the whole, we are -of opinion that the law
is constitutional, and the jurisdiction vested in the
Courts of the district; and, therefore, that the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for
further proceedings.
Judgment. reversed.

By the conquest and military occupation of a portion of the terrritory

The subsequent evacuation of the conquered territory by the enemy,
and resumption of authoity by the United St:tes, cannot change
the character of past transactions. The jus postliminii does not
apply to the case; and, goods prei oudy importea do notbecome

to the Circuit Court of Massachusetts.
This was an action of debt, brought by the United
States against the defendant, upon a bond -for the penal
sum of 15,000 dollars, dated the 17th of April, 1816,
with the following condition: The condition .of this â€¢
obligation is such, that if the above bounden Henry,
Rufus, and David, or either of them, or either of their
heirs, executors, or administrators, shall and do, on or
before the 17th day of October next, well and truly
pay, or cause to be paid, unto the collector of the
customs for the district of Penobscot,"for the time
being, the sum of 7,500 dollars, or the amount of the
duties to be ascertained as due and arising on certain goods, wares, and merchandises,.entered by the
above bounden Henry Rice, as imported-into Castine,
during its occupation by the British troops, as per
entry dated this date, then the above obligation to be
void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.
Oyer of the cont'ition being had, the defendant
pleaded as follows: That before the time of the
making of the supposed writing obligatory, to wit,
on the 18th of June, in the year of our Lord 1812,
war was declared by the Congress of the said United States, to exist between the united kingdom of
Great Britain. and Ireland, and the dependencies

said united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,
and the dependencies thereof, from the said 18th of
June, until the 17th of February, in the year of our
Lord 1815, on which said last-mentioned day, a
treaty of peace and amity between the said United
States and the king of the said united kingdom, was
accepted, ratified, and confirmed. And the said Henry: farther says, that during the continuance of such
war and hostilities as aforesaid, and before the
making of the said supposed writing obligatory, to
wit, on the 1st of September, in the year of our Lord
1814, the said king of the said united kingdom, in
prosecution of said war against the said United States i
did, with a naval and military force, and in a hostile
manner,' attack, subdue, capture, and take possession
of the town and harbour of Castinie, situated in the
District of Maine, and continued to hold the excluive and undisturbed possession of the same by a
naval and military force, and in a hostile manner, and
secured his said possession by muniments and miliitaryworks, and had, and exercised the exclusive control and government thereof, from the day last afore-'
said, continually,, until the said ratification of the
treaty aforesaid. And immediately after the capture
of said town and harbpur, and before the importation
of -the goods and merchandises in the condition of
said. writing mentioned, the said king of the said united kingdom caused a custom -house, or excise office,
to be established at said Castine. and appointed a eollector of the customs there, who thereupon entered

entry thereof with the collector of the district of Penobscot,' as hereinafter mentioned, and the making
and executing of the said supposed writing obligatory, to wit, on the 127th of April, in the year of our
Lord 1815, in pursuance of the said treaty so made
and ratified as aforesaid, the said town of Castine was
evacuated by the troops and forces of said king, and
possession thereof was taken by the said United
States. And he further avers, that after the ratification of the treaty aforesaid, and after hostilities had

15th day of April, in the year of our Lord, 1815, at
Castine, to wit, at said Boston, the said Thomas, Samuel, and Greenleaf, for a valuable consideration,

Henry, to enter the said goods and merchandises with

United States, from a foreign port or place, on the.

aforesaid. Whereupon, to prevent the seizure and
detention of said goods and merchandises by. said.
collector, and the losses and damages that would
have ensued thereon, and that he, the said Henry,
might, without any lawful interruption, or molestation by said Collector, retain and .dispose of said

said goods and merchandises with the said collector, in the said custom house at Castine, and in

Mr. Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Feb.Rice.
22d.
Court.
The single question arising on the pleadings in
this case is, whether goods imported into Castine
during its occupation by the enemy are liable to the
duties imposed by the revenue laws upon goods imported into the United States. It appears, by the
pleadings, that on the first day of September, 1814,
Castine was captured by the enemy, and remained
in his exclusive possession, under the command and
control of his military and naval forces, until after
the ratification of the treaty of peace in February,
1815. During this period the British government
exercised all civil and military authority over the
place ; and established a custom-house, and admitted
goods to be imported, according to regulations prescribed by itself, and, among others, admitted the

goods upon which duties are now demanded. These
goods remained at Castine until after it was evacuated by the enemy; and, upon the re-establishment
of the American. government, the collector of the
customs, claiming a right to American duties on the
goods, took the bond in question from the defendant,
for the security of them.
Under these circumstances, we are all of opinion,
that the claim for duties cannot be sustained. By
the conquest and military occupation of Castine, the
enemy acquired that firm possession which enabled
him to exercise the fullest rights of sovereignty over
that place. The sovereignty of the United States
over the territory was, of course, suspended, and the
laws of the United States could no longer be rightfully enforced there, or be obligatory upon the inhabitants who remained and submitted to the conquerors. By the surrender the inhabitants passed
under a teroporary allegiance to the British government, and were bound by such laws, and such only,
as it chose to recognise and impose. From the nature o&f the case, no other laws could be obligatory
upon-them, for where there is no protection or allegiance or sovereignty, there can be no claim td obedience. Castiae was, therefore, during this period,
so far as respected our. revenue laws, to be deemed"
a.foreign port; and goods imported into it by the,
inhabitants, were subject to such duties only as the
British government chose to require. Such goods
vere in no correct sense imported into the United
States. The subsequent evacuation by the enemy,
and iesumpti6r of authority by ther United States,

'OF THE UNITED STATES.

did not, and could not, change the character of the
previous transactions. The doctrines respecting the
jus postliminii are wholly inapplicable to the case.
imThe goods were liable to American duties, when
ported, or not at all. That they are so liable at the
time of importation is clear, from what has been
already stated ; and when, upon the return of peace,
the jurisdiction of the United States was re-assumed,
they were in the same predicament as they would
have been if Castine had been a foreign territory
ceded by treaty to the United States, and the goods
had been previously imported there. In the latter
case, there would be no pretence to say that American duties could be demanded; and, upon principles
of public or municipal law, the cases are not distinguishable. The authorities cited at the bar would,
if there were any dyutbt, be decisive of the question. But we think"# too clear to require. any aid
from authority.
Judgment affirmed, with costs.
