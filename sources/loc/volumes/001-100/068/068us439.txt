Opinion of the court.

land is withdrawn from location; you cannot be heard." If
the grantee, Ross, lost part of his land by Henderson's grant,
and his warrants were merged by this misfortune, equity
required that Congress should declare his survey to be valid
by a curative act. This is the principle governing the decisions in the cases of Galloway v. _'nkey (12 Peters, 294), and
McArthur v. Dun (7 Howard, 264), where the entries, surveys, and patents had been made-to dead men, and were void
of course for want of a grantee; yet this court held that the
act of 1807 applied, and that a second entry on the first survey was void. In the case of Subblefield v. .Boggs (2 Ohio
State Reports, 216), the same doctrine is maintained.
We hold that the survey of Ross was protected, and that
Saunders's entry, survey, and patent were void, and order
that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio be reversed,
and that the cause be remanded to that court, to be proceeded with in conformity to this opinion.

[Sup. Ct

Statement of the case.
United States, and the withdrawal of their appeal therefrom, it is conclusive, not only on the question of title, but also as to the boundaries
which it specifies.
Messrs. Justices CLIFFORD, MILLER, and SwAy.E, dissented in this case.

APPEAL by the United States from a decree of the District
Court for the Northern District of California, approving the
survey of a tract of land claimed under a Mexican grant,
confirmed to Folsom, deceased. The case was thus:
In 1844, William A. Leidesdorff presented his petition to
the then Governor of California, for the grant of a tract of
land, the petition representing as follows:

That being owner of a great number of large cattle, and desirous of owning in fee a place to take care of them, he has found
one vacant, bounded by the lands of Seflor Sutter, as shown by
the annexed map, which he duly transmits. Said place is on the
bank of the American River, and consists of four leagues in
length towards the east, and two in breadth towards the south.
Accompanying this petition was a diseilo or map of the
land, and a certificate from Sutter, local magistrate, that the
same was "then unoccupied, and was that represented in
the map." The map, in this, as in most of the California
cases, was but a rude sketch, showing but the general position and outline of the land asked for; and herein, that is
to say, in its want of full and exact delineation-as will be
seen hereafter-was one of the difficulties of the case. The
petition, map, and certificate having been presented, Jimeno,
Secretary of State, made report, October 1, 1844, to the go

vernor, as follows:
"The laud solicited is vacant, as shown by the annexed certificate; and it appears by the map, to be so well marked out, and so
near to the place of Sefior Sutter, that I think there is no difficulty to your excellency's granting to the person intorested, the
land petitioned for."
The provisional concession of the governor, Micheltorena,
dated October 8, 1844, was subsequently made. In this, the
governor declares Leidesdolff " owner in fee of the land

Statement of the case.

which is situated on the banks of the river named 'the
American,' bounded by the land granted to the colony of
Sefior Sutter, and by the hills (lomerias) on the east; in extent
eight square leagues."*
The formal grant from the same governor, dated October
8, 1844, issued next. Reciting that Leidesdorff had "petitioned for eight square leagues on the bank of the river
called that of ' Los Am ericanos,' bounded by the land granted
to the colony of Mr. Sutter, and by the ranges of hills (' lome.
rias') on the east," and that "the proper measures and examinations being previously made as required by laws and regulations," the said governor granted him, Leidesdorff, "the
aforesaid land."
This title of Leidesdorff became subsequently vested in
Folsom, and a petition for a confirmation of title under the
grant, having been presented in September, 1852, to the
Board of Commissioners created under the act of March 3d,
1851, to ascertain and settle private land claims in California,
Folsom produced before the board the original papers mentioned above. Testimony was also taken with reference to
the line of Sutter on the west, and also with reference to the
position and distance of the "lomerias," or range of hills, on
the east. The board confirmed the claim, and entered a
decree of confirmation. This decree read as follows:
"The land of which confirmation is made, .... is the same
which was granted to William A. Leidesdorff by Governor
Micheltorena on the 8th day of October, 1844, and is bounded as
follows, to wit: Beginning at an oak tree on the bank of the
American River, marked as a boundary to the lands granted to
John A. Sutter, and running thence south with the line of said
Sutter two leagues; thence easterly, by lines parallel with the
general direction of the said American River, and at the distance,
* No copy of the disefio or map accompanying the original petition,
came to the leporter's possession; though he understood that the -i&mertas" on the east were not designated upon it. He -upposes, that in fact,
they lay somewhat in the direction of the doied lines, indicating one survey
of the tract as that line runs northwesterly and above the mouth of Alder
Creek, towards the American River. On the disego this river ran nearly
west.

UNITED STATES V. HALLECK.

[Sup. Ct

Statement of the case.

as near as may be, of two leagues therefrom, four leagues, or so
far as may be necessary to include in the tract the quantity of
eight square leagues; thence northerly, by a line parallel to the
one above-described, to the American River; thence along the
southern bank of said river, and bending thereon to the point of
beginning. For a more particular description, reference to be had
to the original grant and to the petition and map containedin the
espediente."
The case was removed by appeal to the District Court of
the United States for the Northern District of California. In
March, 1857, the attorney-general gave notice that no further appeal would be prosecuted by the United States, and
upon stipulation of the district attorney, pursuant to such
notice, the court, April 80th, 1857, "on motion of the district attorney, ordered, adjudged and decreed that the claimants have leave to proceed under the decree of the land
commission heretofore rendered in their favor as under final
decree."
Previous to the entry of this order, Folsom died, and his
executors, Halleck and others, being substituted in his place,
the subsequent proceedings were carried on in their names.
In May, 1857, a survey was made of the tract confirmed,
by directions of the Surveyor-General of California, and was
approved by him. From the name of the officer this survey
is called in the argument of counsel "the Hays survey."
This survey was forwarded to the Commissioner of the Land
Office at Washington, in order that a patent might be issued
upon it. The commissioner approved of it; but the Secretary of the Interior, to whom the case was taken, disapproved it; and in September, 1858, the case was sent back
to the surveyor-general for a new survey. So far as the
Reporter understood a case which he did not hear, the objections to the Hays survey in the secretary's mind was, that
it ran on the east far beyond that point where the lomerias,
fixed in the original grant by Governor Micheltorena, were
supposed to be; this range havin.g, on the disefio or map
attached to Leidesdorff's original petition, been indicated a

being near a stream, not named, indeed, by Leidesdorff, but
which was assumed by the secretary to be Alder Creek.
The surveyor-general, accordingly, made and approved a
new survey. From the name of the officer under whom this
second survey was made it is distinguished as "the Mandeville survey." It was based apparently on instructions sent
down from the Land Office on dissatisfaction with the former
survey; these instructions saying, "that the decree of confrmation resting upon the disefo and grant must be satisfied
by the survey; first, by adhering to Sutter's line on the west,
the American River on the north, and the foot-hills* near the
junction on the east of acreek distinctly laid down on the disefo; that
the said creek isheld to be identicalwith Alder aeek, ... the said
hills running near the junction of said creek, and in a southeasterly direction. That these are the naturalfeatures which
must control the longitudinal extension of the grant. But,"
the instructions went on to say, "as quantity was petitioned
for, granted, and confirmed, the said quantity may be taken
by increasingthe depth of the survey, so as to comprise the
eight square leagues; thereby giving the location a more
compact form." The differences of the survey and the difficulties of the case will be exhibited by reference to the map
inserted in the report.
On the 22d of November, 1859, the District Court, acting
upon the impression that it had jurisdiction to supervise all
surveys of confirmed claims under Mexican grants, under
the decision of the Supreme Court, in the United States v.
.Fossatt,tordered the new survey made by Mandeville to be
returned into court, and authorized the claimants to file exceptions to it. The survey was accordingly returned, and
exceptions were tiled by the claimants and purchasers under
them.
After the passage of the act of June 14, 1860-by which
new powers were given to the District Courts of California,
with authority to order into court any survey, and to decide

on it-a monition was issued for notice to all parties, claiming
any interest in the survey and location, to appear before the
court, on or before September 26, 1860, for the protection of
such interests, or their defaults would be taken. On the
return of the monition, counsel appeared in behalf of the
United States, and also counsel for the claimants, and also
counsel for the Natoma Water Company, a corporation
created under the laws of California. The default of all
other parties not appearing was entered. Folsom subsequently filed exceptions to the survey. Among the exceptions tiled to it in his behalf were these:
"1. Because it does not conform to the description of the land
confirmed as contained in the decree of final confirmation.
"2. Because the grant calls for four leagues in length upon
the American River, and two leagues in width from north to
south, and the said survey gives the said tract less than two and
one-half leagues in length on said river, and makes the same
more than three leagues in width from north to south; thereby
entirely changing the form of said tract from the form in which
it was granted.
"3. Because the claim was regularly surveyed, and the survey
thereof approved by United States Surveyor-General Hays, in
May, 1857, which survey was in conformity with the final decree
of confirmation.
"4. The survey of Mandeville ought to b rejected, and the
survey heretofore made by Hays ought to be adopted, because
the latter locates said eastern boundary in pursuance of the final
decree, and the former ignores the said decree altogether, and
professes to follow the arbitrary and illegal instructions of the
Secretary of the Interior, said instructions being in conflict with
said final decree, and with the evidence in the case filed before
the land commissioners before whom the said eastern boundary
was a question litigated by both parties hereto, and settled by
the said final decree."
The United States also, by Mr. Williams, "acting in this
case as United States District Attorney, at the request of
Mr. Benham, who was once counsel for some of the claimants," filed several objections, embracing in substance the
following:

Dec. 1863.]

UNITED STATES V. HALLECK.

Argument for the appelant.

1st. That the survey was not according to the final decree of
confirmation entered in the above-entitled cause, or to the grant
and other title-papers upon which that decree was founded, or to
the evidence of the witnesses in the said cause, but in violation
thereof is made to extend more than two leagues south of the
American River, and thereby to embrace public lands of the
United States not rightfully included -ithin the limits of the said
claim.
2d. That the survey wrongfully includes lands not at any time
claimed by Folsom or his representatives, but, on the contrary.
expressly disclaimed.
3d. That it is erroneous, because the laud granted and con.
firmed was a tract bounded on the west by Sutter's eastern line;
on the north by the American River; on the east by Alder
Creek and the neighboring low hills; and on the south by vacant
lands; the southern line to be at a distance of two leagues from
the river, as near as may be, and run on subdivision lines, so as
to meet the meanderings of the river. Whereas the said survey
does not regard these boundaries, but shows a southern line at
right angles with the western line, disregards the meanderings
of the river, and thereby includes within its lines a much larger
quantity of land than was granted, and also includes many settlers under the United States, who have so settled and made
improvements in good faith long before the said official survey
was made.
Upon these exceptions, evidence was taken, and in lNovember, 1861, the District Court set the survey aside, and
ordered a new one to be made.* A rehearing being granted,
the original survey made by Hays was approved and confirmed by the cohrt. The decree of approval was entered

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for the appellant.

location of the land as shown by the Hays survey; although
the record also contains sufficient matter to enable the court
to direct the correct manner of survey and location, if the
'nited States succeed in showing that the Hays location is
incorrect. We insist that the survey and location of the
land, as shown by the Hays plat, are incorrect, and must be
set aside.
It is the duty of the one who comes here for confirmation
of a land claim, not only to establish the validity of his title
to some land, but also to point out the land, and identify it
with the tract conceded hih by the former government of
California. It isenough for us to show that the land claimed
is not that which was in contemplation of the granting power.
It is not for the government to show how the land should be
located; that is a matter for the claimant to demonstrate.
The Mandeville survey was made in general conformity
with the directions, mentioned, ante, on page 443, and sent
down by the Land Office to the Surveyor-General of California, when the Hays survey was disapproved, and a glance
at that and the Hays survey will show the chief difference
of opinion in this matter between claimants and the government.
When Leidesdorff applied for land, and the reports thereon
had been made, Governor Micheltorena made his provisional
concession of a tract "situated on the banks of the river
named the American, bounded by the land granted to the
colony of Seflor Sutter, and by the hills on the east." The
initial point and two lines are here fixed, and have never
been disputed, to wit: the point on the river where the
Hays survey begins, the river in its extension, and the line
running north and south from the initial point, which has
always been treated on all sides as coterminous with the
lands of Sutter's colony. It is evident that the location cannot be extended beyond these assigned boundaries. There
is also a terminus towards the east, beyond which the location cannot be extended, because the titles made by the
granting power went no further. This is the line of the
"lomerias."
It would not matter even if Leidesdroff had

Argument for the appellant.

expressly asked for land beyond these, bounds, for we are to
seek not what he desired to get, but what the governor chose
to give. In the documents of title which have been presented as emanating from that officer, the "lomerias" are
laid down by him as the extreme limits of the land towards
the east. They are laid down in the same instruments and
with the same particularity as are the American River and
the lands of the colony of Sutter. We therefore contend
that the concession can no more be stretched across the
"lomerias" than across any other of the particularized boundaries.
Then we have three of the inclosing lines of the granted
tract,-the western, northern, and eastern. The fourth line
is not fixed in the grant, and is dependent upon quantity for
the place in which it shall run. It is therefore the discretionary line, all the others being fixed, and not to be moved,
even if there should be difficulty in deciding upon the location of this southern line. By the express terms of the grant,
then, it must be satisfied out of land lying southwardly on
the American River, and between the lands of Sutter's colony and the "lomerias" on the west and east, respectively,
extending southwardly to make up the quantity which may
be held to have been granted. For the present we will presume that to have been eight leagues.
Having settled what are the fixed boundaries of this land,
we next inquire where those boundaries are.
There is no dispute about the northern and western lines,
but we have to ascertain where are the "lomerias" which
are the eastern boundary, and here there is contention. We
assert they are to be found in a row of hills arising a short
distance from the mouth of Alder Creek, at its junction with
the Amelican River, and running thence in a southerly or
southeasterly direction towards th~e Cosumnes River, the
next stream which flows westward from the Sierra Nevada.
'We shall be met with the objection that we have no right
to look into this matter at all; that under the circumstances,
we are confined to such deseription of the land as is given in
the decree of the land commission, and that from its decree

Argument for the appellant.

the Hays survey may be constructed. Now, it will be said,
that this description is conclusive and exhaustive of the description of the land; that in its location we can only seek
for such land as is therein described; and as the board exA1uded the "lomerias" from contemplation in describing the
tract, we are, in this proceeding, estopped from any examination as to what they are or where they are. This is a strange
argument. We must presume, in the words of the judge
below, when he rejected this survey, "that neither in this
case nor in any other did the board mean to confirm the
claim for any other tract than that described in the grant,
and delineated in the disefio." Can we presume that the
board deliberately excluded as one of the boundaries a natural landmark, called for by every one of the instruments
of title produced by the claimants as issued to the original
grantee? But in setting up tlis argument claimants have
not quoted the whole of the decree, for immediately after the
part above recited the decree goes on continuously to say,
"For a more particulardescription, reference to be had to the oriqinalgrant,and to thepetition and map contained in the espediente."
This must be conclusive. Is not this latter quotation as much
a part of the decree as the former? Has not the reference
to the description in the grant and espediente, &c., the same
effect as if the words had been set out in the decree? And
are we now, when in search of the "more particular description," to be estopped from reading the documents to
which the commission has referred us? This would suit the
claimants, because by disregarding the "lomerias," as unnamed by the decree, they might stretch their claim beyond
the limit assigned by the grant. But the reference to the
grant makes the decree, in law, precisely the same as if the
boundary "lomerias" was fully and particularly, and in
words, inserted therein, for " verba illata inesse videntur." In
truth, the board intended in this case, as in all others, to give
a general description of the land, leaving it for after-proceedings by the surveyors or other proper authority to compare
and assimilate the land as it exists in nature with its description m the title-papers.

Dec. 1863.]

UNITED STATES V. HALLECK.
Argument for the appellant.

[The counsel here proceeded to comment upon the evidence in the case. They noted particularly the call in the
decree of the board for an "1easterly" course after the lines
should leave Sutter's land; and argued that as this was to
be "1parallel with the general direction of the said American
River," it was obvious that the exact course of that river
was not well known to the board, for that the line could not
run "east" and be parallel to the river at all. Undeniably,
the line was to be an "easterly" one; and this being so, rendered necessary a change in the other lines east and west, so
as to conform with the general intent of the board respecting the southern boundary. The counsel also argued from
the evidence that the "lomerias"-hills on the east-were
situated west of Alder Creek and the eastern line run by
Hays; and that from the whole evidence, and especially from
original title-papers and map, it was clear that the land
granted to Leidesdorff, and described in the espediente, is
contained within the bounds of the Mandeville survey. In
reply to a question from the court, in what way they reconciled their apparent inconsistency in taking positions in support of the second or Mandeville survey in this argument,
which were the reverse of the objections which had once
been urged in the name of the United States in the court
below, they answered, that the objections below were not
those of the United States, but of individual claimants; that
this form of proceeding was upheld by the district judge,
who considered these proceedings upon surveys in the nature
of proceedings in rem, and held that parties claiming interests
in the subject-matter should be allowed to use the name of
the United States to bring their claims to the notice of the
court;* that the objections, accordingly, though put forward
in the name of the United States, were, in point of fict,
urged in behalf of settlers claiming part of the tract surveyed
as public land and open to settlement.]

VOL. 1.

RE.

UNITED STATES V. HALLECK.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for the respondent.

A. P. Catlin and T S. Black,.for respondent:
1. The decree of the land commission in this case, by the
dismissal of the appeal and the decree of the District Court
of April 30, 1857, became final and conclusive as to all the
questions decided by it. Under the act of 1860, the District
Court did not acquire jurisdiction to open or reform the decree, but was confined to the duty of seeing that the surveyor ran the lines according to the decree.
2. The Hays survey is in conformity with the lines laid
down in the decree. But the government contends that the
said lines do not correspond with the original documentary
title-papers; that the boundary lines laid down in the decree of confirmation, do not correspond with the boundaries
named in the grant and other documentary title-papers, and
consequently that a new decree, corresponding with such
boundary, ought to be made.
I. If the descriptive portion of the decree can be disposed
of upon such grounds, there would be nothing final in any
branch of the case. The inquiry might be pushed still further, and the authority of the governor and all other vital
questions upon which the commission passed, be laid bare
for inspection and readjudication.
ii. The court must construe the decree upon its face, when
it is clear and plain, and the matters upon which a decree
are founded are not resorted to for the purposes of construction, unless in the terms of the decree there is some want
of clearness or some difficulty in understanding it. Understanding it is construing it, and if we understand it, there
is no need of groping back into the darkness out of which
the light of the decree was created. When the decree is
understood, then it is construed. But the construction for
which the appellant's counsel contend, is the power to construe the meaning of the original parties to the grant, in
other words, to exercise the same power which the Land
Commissioners exercised, and to review as upon appeal the
judgment of that tribunal, and to make a new decree, in so
far as it becomes necessary to illustrate the difference of
opinion which may exist between the Dismct Court under

Dec. 1863.]

UNITED STATES V. HALLECK.

Argument for the respondent.

the act of 1860, and the Land Commission under the act of
1851. There is no telling to what extent this mode of construction might be carried. It is equal to the power of
m.aldng a new decree, and of reversing the judgment of a
court, the meaning of which it pretends only to construe. It
is said that the form of the tract produced by the lines of
the decree show that the board, by the term "easterly," applied to the general course of the southern boundary, evidently intended that line should run more nearly east than
it does in the Hays survey, and that the board must have
supposed that the general course of the river was east, and
that in order to carry out the meaning of the board we must
change the course of the other lines on the east and west, in
order to conform with the supposed intention of the board
respecting the southern boundary. The assumption that the
board did not understand the course of the river, is without
foundation, and is contradicted by the terms of the decree itself. The peculiar manner in which the -southern boundary
lines are constructed, show that the board perfectly well understood that the course of the river was circuitous and irregular, and that its general course was not east. After first
directing the starting-point to be the oak tree, and the first
line to run from thence "south" two leagues, it says, "thence
' easterly,' by lines parallel with the general direction of the
said American River, and at the distance, as near as may be,
of two leagues therefrom." The course provided by this
language is the course of the river by its bends and turns,
and so the line is to be divided in parts to accommodate
itself to these bends and turns, otherwise the board, if it had
supposed the course of the river to be east or near east,
would have said, thence "easterly in a line," instead of
"easterly in lines." The term "easterly" is only necessary
to indicate the way to turn when at the end of the first line,
whether toward the west or toward the east. We understand the w6rd easterly in its usual acceptation to mean to
the east generally, in contradistinction to west, north, or
south, and is correctly appli'd to any general direction to
the east, as opposed to the west, which would not be better

indicated by using the terms northerly or southerly. In
this decree the term easterly has qualifying words attached
to it, showing that it meant the direction of the American
River from the oak tree.
Mr. Justice FIELD delivered the opinion of the court:
This case comes before us on appeal from a decree of the
District Court of the United States for the Northern District
of California, approving the survey of the tract confirmed
to Folsom, the testator of the respondents. The grant to
Leidesdorff, from whom the respondents deraign their title,
was issued in October, 1844, by Micheltorena, then Governor
of the Department of California. In September, 1852, the
claim for the land granted was presented to the Board of
Commissioners created by the act of March 3d, 1851, and
by a decree of that body, rendered in June, 1855, the claim
was adjudged valid and confirmed. The case being removed by appeal to the District Court, the attorney-general
gave notice that the appeal would not be prosecuted by
the United States, and upon the stipulation of the district
attorney in pursuance of such notice, the claimants had leave
to proceed upon the decree of the board as upon a final
decree.
The grant describes the land as consisting of eight square
leagues, and as situated on the bank of the American River,
and bounded by land previously granted to the colony of
Sutter, and by a range of hills-" lomerias "-on the east.
The provisional concession preceding the issue of the formal
title, gives a similar description. The petition of Leidesdorff, which the grant recites, represents the land as being
"four leagues in length towards the east, and two in breadth
towards the south," and refers to a map transmitted with it.
This map is a rough sketch indicating the general locality
and outline of the land solicited.
The original papers give the locality, the form, and the
dimensions of the tract granted. It is situated on the southern bank of the American River; it is four leagues in length
by two leagues in width; it embraces eight square leagues;

Opinion of the court.

and it is bounded by the land of Sutter on the west. From
the data thus furnished, the boundaries, which are not designated, can be readily ascertained and declared. As a ques.
tion was made before the board upon the location of some
of the boundaries, and testimony was taken as to the line of
the land of Sutter, and the position Qf the range of hills on
the east, the case was a proper one for the board to fix with
precision and declare the boundaries in its decree. As the
appeal from the decree rendered was withdrawn by the
United States, it is unnecessary to consider the character of
the testimony produced or the weight to which it was entitled. The board acted upon it in connection with the titlepapers, and in its decree, entered in April, 1857, declared the
boundaries of the tract, running the same, except on the side
of the river, by courses and distances.
In May following, a survey of the tract confirmed, was
made under the directions of the Surveyor-General of California, and was approved and transmitted by him to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, at Washington, for
examination and approval preliminary to the issue of a patent In May, 1858, the commissioner appears to have approved the survey, and to have made preparations to carry
the same into a patent, but was overruled by the Secretary
of the Interior, who, in September following, disapproved
of the survey, and sent the case back to the surveyor-general. At the subsequent December Term of this court, the
decision of the case of the United States v. Charles Fossat (21
Howard, 445), was made, which was supposed by the District Court of California to recognize a jurisdiction in that
court to supervise all surveys of confirmed claims under
Mexican grants. Acting upon this view of the decision, the
District Court, in INovember, 1859, ordered the new survey
which had been made by the surveyor-general to be returned into court, and gave leave to the claimants to file exceptions to it. The new survey was accordingly returned,
and exceptions to it were filed by the claimants and purchasers under them; and proceedings upon the exceptions
vere pending on the passage of the act of June 14th, 1860.

UNITED STATES V. HIALLECK.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

Whatever question might be raised as to the jurisdiction of
the District Court to supervise the survey .previous to that
act, there can be none since its passage. That act applies
not merely to surveys subsequently made, but also to such
surveys as had been previously made and approved by the
surveyor-general, and returned into the District Court upon
objections to their correctness. Under the act, a monition
was issued, and on its return counsel appeared on behalf of
the United States, and for the claimants, and for the Natoma
Water Company, a purchaser under the claimants. No other
party appeared, and the court ordered "the default of all
parties not appearing" to be entered. The United States
subsequently filed their exceptions. All parties agreed in
averring a want of conformity in the survey with the description of the land contained in the decree of final confirmation.
The District Court set the survey aside, and ordered a new
one. Subsequently, upon a rehearing, it approved and confirmed the survey originally made. From its decree in this
respect the United States appealed, and on the argument of
the appeal took positions in support of the second survey,
which are directly the reverse of the objections urged in
their name in the court below. To the apparent inconsistency in their action in this respect the attention of counsel
was called, and the explanation given was that objections in
the District Court, though put forward in the name of the
United States, were in fact urged on behalf of settlers claiming that part of the tract covered by the survey, was public
land open to settlement. It is unnecessary to express any
opinion upon the sufficiency of this explanation, or whether
the United States are bound by objections on the record,
which are advanced in their name, when presented for the
protection of parties claiming interests under them by preemption, settlement, or other right or title. We refer to the
matter, not because our judgment will be in any respect
affected by it, but to indicate that it would be the better
practice for the district attorney, when appearing for third
parties in the name of the United States, to state the fact,

Opinion of the court.

and give the names of the real contestants in the exceptions
filed.
The material question for determination is, whether the
survey approved conforms to the decree of confirmation.
There must exist a reasonable conformity between them, or
the survey cannot be sustained. And such reasonable conformity we at once perceive when we take up the survey and
trace its lines under the directions of the decree. Indeed,
we do not think that such conformity will be seriously controverted by the learned counsel of the appellants, if the survey be restricted to the description contained in the decree.
Their position is, that this description is to be controlled by
the original grant and by the petition and map contained in
the espediente, to which reference is made at the close of the
decree; in other words, that the question of boundary is
open for adjudication precisely as it would be if no description had been given. The position of the learned counsel
in this respect cannot be maintained. The documents to
which reference is made can only be resorted to in order to
explain an ambiguity in the language of the description
given; they cannot be resorted to in order to change the
natural import of the language used, if there be no uncertainty therein. If reference to original title-papers, where
no doubt arises upon the terms of the decree, would authorize an inquiry into a matter of boundary, it would with
equal propriety authorize an inquiry into any other matter
upon which the commission had acted; and every question
affecting the decree might be opened anew to consideration
and contestation.
The decree in this case is plain, and admits of only one
construction: the object of the appellants is to change the
meaning of its language, by showing that the commissioners
were ignorant of the true course and direction of the American River, and therefore intended different lines from those
they specifically declared, and that they could not have
intended the eastern line to run as directed, in disregard of
what is asserted to be the true position of the "lomerias."
The answer to-all efforts of this kind is, that the decree is

a finality, not only on the question of title, but as to the
boundaries which it specifies. If erroneous in either particular, the remedy was by appeal; but the appeal having been
withdrawn by the government, the question of its correctness is forever closed.
The decree of the District Court is
AFFIRMED.

THE INSURANCE COMPANIES V. "WRIGHT.
1. *Where a written contract is susceptible on its face of a construction that
is "reasonable," resort cannot be had to evidence of custom or usage to
explain its language. And this general rule of evidence applies to an
instrument so loose as an open or running policy of assurance, and even
to one on which the phrases relating to the matter in contest are scattered about the document in a very disorderly way. NELSON and FIVLD,
JJ., dissenting from the rule, or from its application in this case: in
which there was a clause that, as they conceived, made the evidence of
usage proper.
2. The expression "rate," or "rating" of vessels, as used in policies of assurance, means relative state in regard to insurable qualities. Hence,
where a policy requires that a vessel shall not be below a certain "rate,"
as, Ex gr., "not below A 2;" this rate is not, in the absence of agreement to that effect, to be established by the rating-register alone of the
office making the insurance--certainly not unless the vessel was actually rated there,-nor by a standard of rating anywhere in the port
merely where that office is. There being, as yet, no "American Lloyds,"
the party assured-if not actually rated on the books of the office insuring-may establish the rate by any kind of evidence which shows
what the vessel's condition really was; and that, had she been rated at
all at the port where the office was, she would have rated in the way
required. He may even show how she would have rated in her port of
departure, or in one where the company insuring had an agency through
which the insurance in question was effected; this being shown, of
course, not as conclusive on the matter of rate, but as bearing upon it,
and so fit for consideration by the jury.
8 Evidence is not admissible of a general usage and understanding among
shippers and insurers of the port in which the insuring office.is, that in
open policies the expresion used, as EBgr., "not below A 2," refers to
