JAmES N. CURRAN, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V. THE STATE OF ARKANSAS, THE BANK OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS, JOHN A. Ross,
FINANCIAL RECEIVER, AND DAVID
NEY.

WV.

CARROL, BANK ATTOR-

In 1836, the Legislature of Arkansas incorporated a bank with the usual banking powers of discount, deposit, and circulation, the State being the sole stockholder.
The bank.went into operation, and issued bills in the usual form, but in November,
1839, suspended specie payments.
Afterwards, the legislature passed several acts of the following description:
1843, January, continuing the corporate existence of tie bank, and subjecting its
affairs -to the management of a financial receiver and an attorney, who were directed to cancel certain bonds of the State, held by the benk. for modney borrowed by
the State, and reduce the State's capital in. the bank by an equal amount.
1843, February, directing the officers to transfer to the Stare a certain amount of specie,
for the purpose of paving the members of the legislature.
1845, January, requiring the officers to receive the bonds of the State which had been
issued as part of the cap'tal of the bank in payment for debts due to the bank.
1845 January, another ac, taking away certain specie and par funds for the purpose
of paying members of: e legislature, and placing other funds to the credit of the
State, subject to be drawn out by appropriation.
1846, vesting in the State all titles to real estate or other property taken by the bank
in paypent for debts due to -it.
1849, requiring the officers to receive, in payment ofdebts due to the bank, not only
the bonds of the State, which had been issued to constitut tie capital of the bank,
but those also which had been issued to constitute the capital of other banking carporations which were then insolvent.
U n general principles of law a creditbr of an insolvent; corporation can pursue its
assets into the hands of all other persons except toad fide creditors or purchasers,
and-there is nothing in the character of the parties in the present eae or in the laws
transferring the property, to make it an exception to ths general rule. For the Supreme court of Arkansas has decided thqt the State car be sued in this case.
The bills of the bank being payable on demand, there was a contract with the holder
to pay them; and these laws, which withdrew the assets of the bank into a different
channel, impaired the obligation of this contract.
Nor does the repeal or modification of the charter of the bank by the legislature prevent this conclusion from being drawn. But in this czse the charter of ihe bank
has never been repealed..
Besides the contract between the bill-holder and the haul:, there was a contract between the bill-holder and the State, which had placed funds in the bank for the purpose of paving its debts, and which had no right to wihdraw those funds after the
right of a creditor to them had accrued.
The State had no right to pass these laws, under the circurastances, either as a creditor
of the bank or as a trustee taking possession of the real estate for the benefit of all
the creditors.
The several laws examined.
The Supreme Court of the State held these laws to be valid, and consequently the
jurisdiction of this court attaches under the 25th section of the judiciary act.

THIS case was brought up from the Supreme Court of Arkansas, by a writ of error issued under tha 25th section of the
judiciary act

DECE MBER TERM, 1853.
Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

It was argued by llr.Lawrence and Mr. Pike, for the plaintiff
in error, and by .Mr. Sebastian, filing a brief prepared by Mr.
Hempstead, for the defendants in error.
The arguments of counsel upon both sides were in such an
unbroken train of reasoning, that the reporter cannot compress
them into a mere report; and as, together, they made upwards
of sixty pages of print, he cannot publish them entire. The
reader who desires to examine into the case thoroughly, can consult the opinion of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, delivered in
Nover-ber, 1851. In that opinion the court maintains its doctrines Nith great earnestness.
Mr. Justicn CURTIS delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the State of
Arkansas.
The plaintiff in error filed his bill in equity in the Circuit
Court of that State for the county of Pulaski, against the State
of Arkansas, the State Bank of Arkansas, and the financial receiver and the attorney of the bank; and the defendants having
demurred thereto, the Circuit Court overruled the demurrers
and, as the defendants elected to rest thereon, the court made a
decree in favor of the complainant. The defendants appealed
to the Supreme Court, where the demurrers were sustained,
and the bill ordered to be dismissed. This decree the plaintiff
has brought here for reexamination, under the 25th section of
the judiciary act.
As the questions to be determined arise on a demurrer to the
bill, the substance of the case, therein made and confessed by
the demurrer, must be stated, to exhibit the grounds on which
our decision rests.
The bill shows that the Bank of the State of Arkansas was
incorporated by the legislature of that State in 1836, with the
usual banking powers of discount, deposit, and circulation, and
that the State in fact was, and was designed by the charter
to be, its sole stockholder. That the capital stock of the bank
consisted of $1,146,000, raised by the sale of bonds of the State,
together with certain other sums paid in by the State as part
of the capital stock, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of
$350,753, being in the whole $1,496,753; all which was in specie, or specie funds. That the bank was required by its charter'
to have on hand at all times sufficient specie to pay its bills on
demand. That the plaintiff, being the owner and bearer of bills
of this bank, amounting to upwards of $9,000, which the bank
had refused to pay, instituted suits and recovered judgments
thereon at law, upon which executions, running against the
goods, chattels, and lands of the bank, have been duly returned

wholly unsatisfied. The general scope of the bill, therefore, i4
to obtain the aid of a court of equity to reach such assets of
the bank as ought to be appropriated to satisfy this judgment
debt. The parties in whose hands it is alleged these assets are,
are the State of Arkansas and two other defendants, who are
alleged to have charge of certain effects of the bank, in behalf,
and under the authority of the State.
To make a case against these parties, and show that they
hold property, which in equity belongs lo its creditors, and
ought to be appropriated to pay their debts, the bill states, that
the bank having gone into operation, and issued bills to a large
amount, which were then in circulation, gave public notice, on
the 7th day of November, 1839, that the payment of specie was
definitely and finally suspended; and thenceforward, with some
comparatively trifling exceptions, has refused to redeem any of
its bills.
That in January, 1843, the bank still continuing insolvent,
an act was passed by the legislature to licuidate and settle its
affairs. That the assets of the bank then amounted to $1,S:32,120,
of which the sum of $1,000,000, was good and collectible; and
that it had then on hand the sum of $90,301 in specie. This
act expressly continued the corporate existence of the bank; its
affairs were subjected to the management of a financial receiver
and an attorney, who were to apply the :moneys collected by
them to redeem the outstanding circulatior., of the bank; but, at
the same time, bonds of the State, held by the bank, for ioney
borrowed by the State, amounting to at least $200,000, -were
required by this act to be given up and cancelled, and their
amount to be credited to the bank against a part of the capital
stock put in by the State. The bill further shows, that by another act passed at the same February session, in 1843, the officers of the bank were required to transfer, -o the State the sum
of $15,000 in specie, which was appropriated by the act to ppay
the members of that legislature. That on [he 4th day of January, 1845, another act was passed, authorizing th6 officers of the
bank to compromis6 its debts receivable, ad take specific property in payment, and requiring those officers to receive in payment the bonds of the State, issued to raise capital stock for
the bank, notwithstanding the bills of the bank might not have
been taken up.
That on the 10th day of January, 1845, another act was passed,
depriving the bank of all its specie and par funds, and appropriating the specie, first, to pay the members of that legislature, and
declaring that certain funds which had, been placed in the bank,
and made by the charter to form a part of its capital stock,
should be deemed to be deposited there to the credit of the State,
subject to be drawn out-by appropriations.

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

That by another act, passed on the 23d day of December,
1846, the title to all real estate and property of every kind, purchased by said bank, or taken in payment of debts due to it,
vas declared to be vested in the State, and titles to property
received on account of debts due to the bank were required to
be thereafter taken in the name of the State; and the bill avers,
that many different parcels of land specifically mentioned and
described, have been conveyed to the State, under this law, by
debtors of the bank, in satisfaction of their indebtedness.
The bill further states, that, by another act, passed on the 9th
day of January, 1849, the officers of the bank were required to
receive in payment of its debts, bonds of the State, issued to
raise capital for the Real Estate Bank of Arkansas, and other
banking corporations theretofore chartered by the General Assembly, and then insolvent; which last-mentioned bonds amounted
to at least $2,000,000.
The bill prays, among other things, for satisfaction of the
plaintiff's judgment debt out of the assets of the bank thus
shown to have come into the custody, or to stand in the name,
or to have gone to the use of the State by force of the laws
hbove-mentioned; and the jurisdiction of this court, under this
writ of error, is invoked, upon the ground that these laws, or
some of them, impair the obligation of a contract, and that the
highest court of the State has held them valid, and by reason
of such decision, dismissed the complainant's bill.
It follows, that there are three questions for our consideration.
1. What would have been the rights of the complainant under the contracts shown by his bill, if uncontrolled by the particular laws of which he complains?
2. Do those laws, or either of them, impair the obligation of
any contract with the complainant?
3. Does it appear, by the record, that the Supreme Court of
Arkansas held these laws to be valid, and by reason thereof
made a final decree against the complainant.
The first of these questions may be answered "without much
difficulty. The plaintiff is a creditor of an insolvent banking
corporation. The assets of such a corporation are a fund for
the payment of its debts. If they are held by the corporation
itself, and so invested as to be subject to legal process, they may
be levied on by such process. If they have been distributed
among stockholders, or gone into the hands of others than bond
fide creditors or purchasers, leaving debts of the corporation
unpoid, such holders take the property charged with the trust
in lavor of creditors, which a court of equity will enforce, and
cormipel the application of the property to the satisfaction of
their debts.

SUPREME COURT.
Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

This has been often decided, and rests upon plain principles.
In 2 Story's Eq. Jur. § 1252, it is said," Perhaps, to this same
head of implied trusts upon presumed intention, (although it
might equally well be deemed to fall undex the head of implied
trusts by operation of law,) ;ve may refer that class of cases
where the stock and other property of private corporations is
deemed a trust fund for the payment of the debts of the corporation; so that the creditors have a lien, or right of priority of
payment on it, in preference to any of tht: stockholders of the
corporation. Thus, for example: "The capital stock of an incorporated bank is deemed a trust fund for all the debts of the
corporation: and no stockholder can entitle himself to any dividend or share of such capital stock, until all the debts are paid,
and if the capital stock should be divided, leaving any debts
unpaid, every stockholder, receiving his share of the capital
stock, would, in equity, be held liable pro ratd to contribute to
the iischarge of such debts out of the fund in his own hands."
In conformity with this is the doctrine held by this court in
Mumma v. The Potomac Company, 8 Peters, 281.
The cases of Wood v. Dummer, 3 Mason, 308; Wright v.
Petrie, 1 Smedes & Marsh. 319; Nevitt v. Bank of Port Gibson, 6 Id. 513 ; Hightower v. Thornton et al. 8 Georgia R. 493 ;
Nathan v. Whitlock, 3 Edwards, C. R. 215, affirmed by the
chancellor, (9 Paige, 152,) contain elaborate' examinations of
this doctrine, and it has been affirmed and applied in many
other cases.
So far, therefore, as the property of this bank has become
vested in the State or gone tb its use, it is so vested and used,
charged with a trust in favor of this complainant, as an unpaid
creditor, unless there is something in the character of the parties, or the consideration upon which, or 1;he operation of the
lqws by fdrce of which, it has been transferred, taking the case
out of 'the principles above laid down.
Afd, first, as to the character of the parties. By the charter of
this bank, the State, of Arkansas became its sole stockholder.
But the bank was a distinct trading corportion, having a complete separate existence, enabled to enter -into valid contracts
binding itself alone, and having a specific capital stock, provided, and held out to the public as the means to pay its debts.
The obligations of its contracts; the funds. provided for their
performance, and the equitable rights of its creditors were in
no way affected by the fact, that a sovereign state paid in its
capital, and consequently became entitied to its profits. When
paid in and vested in the corporation, the capital stock became chargeable at once with the trusts, and subject to the
uses declared and fixed by the charter, to the same extent, and

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

309

Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

for the same reasons, as it would have been if contributed by
private persons.
That a State, by becoming interested with others in a banking corporation, or by owning all the capital stock, does not
impart to that corporation any of its privileges or prerogatives,
that it lays down its sovereignty, so far as respects the transactions of the corporation, and exercises no power or privilege in
respect to those transactions not derived from the charter, has
been repeatedly affirmed by this cburt, in the Bank of the
United States v. The Planters Bank, 9 Wheat. 904; Bank of
Kentucky v. Wistar et al. 3 Pet. 431; Briscoe v. The Bank of
Kentucky, 11 Id. 324; Darrington et al. v. The Bank of Alabama, 13 How. 12. And our opinion is, that the fact that the
capital stock of this corporation came from the State which
was solely interested in the profits of the business, does not
affect the complainant's right, as a creditor, to be paid out of its
property; a right which, as we have seen, follows the fund into
the hands of every person, save a bond fidd creditor or purchaser, and which a court of equity is bound to enforce by its
decree against any party except such a creditor or purchaser
capable by law of being brought within its jurisdiction.
That the State of Arkansas is capable of being thus sued,
has been decided, after a careful examination, by the Supreme
Court of that State, in this suit; and as this is purely a question of local law, depending on the constitution and statutes of
the State, we follow that decision, and hold, in conformity therewith, that by its own consent the State has become liable to a
decree in favor of the complainant in this suit, if the complainant has valid grounds entitling him to the relief prayed.
Whether there was any thing in the consideration or circumstances of the transfers of the property of the bank to the State,
or to its use, which relieved that property from the trust in favor
of creditors, may best be examined under the next question,
which is, do the laws, by force of which these transfers were
made, impair the obligation of any contract with the complainant.
This question can be answered only by ascertaining what
contracts existed, and what obligations were attached to them,
and then by examining the actual operation of those laws upon
those contracts and their obligations.
The plaintiff was the bearerof bills of the bank, by each of
which the bank promised to pay him, on demand, a certain sum
of money. Of course these payments were to be made out of
the property of the bank. By the laws of the State, existing
when these contracts were made, their bearer had the right, by
legal process, to compel their performance by the levy of an

310

execution on the goods, chattels, lands, and tenements 'of the
bank, by garnisheeing its debtors, and by resorting to a court of
equity to reach- equitable assets, or property conveyed to others
than creditors and bond fide purchasers.
Such were these contracts and their obligations; and it would
seem to require no argument to prove that a law authorizing
and requiring such a corporation to distribute its property
among its stockholders; or transfer it to its sole stockholder,
leavfmg its bills unredeemed, would impair the obligation of the
contracts contained in those bills. The cases of Bronson v.
Kinzie et al. 1 How. 311; and McCracken v. Hayward, 2 Id.
60S,which wvill be mbre particularly adverted to hereafter, leave
no d7oubt on that point. - Indeed it has not been attempted to
maintain, that such a law, operating on the property of a mere
private corporation, whose charter the legislature could not repeal, would be valid. But it is argued tat this is a different
case. That the. egislafure has power to destroy this corporation and thereupon its contracts are no longer in e,istence, and
cannot be enforced against the property of the corporation,
which, upon the repeal of its charter, reverts to the grantors of
its lands and esoheats, so far as it is personalty, to the State,
and that, if it be in the power of the State thus to destroy the
remedies of creditors, by repealing the charter, their rights must
be considered to be entirely subject to the will of the State, and
.no law can impair the obligation of their contracts, because
subjection to any law which may be passed belongs to the very
existence of such contracts. Or, to express the same ideas in
different words, that the State created and can destroy the corporation and all its contracts, Lnd, as it can thus destroy them
by repealing the charter, it can modify, obstruct, and abridge the
rights of creditors and the obligations 'of their contracts, without repealing
'the charter.
Neither these premises, nor thd conclusion deduced from them,
can be admitted.
This banldng corporation, having no other stockholder than
the State, it i not doubte that the State might repeal its charter; but that the effect of such a repeal would le entirely to
destroy the executory contracts of -,he corporation, and to withdraw its property from the just claims of its creditors, cannot
be adroittefd. If such -were the effect of :. repeal of an act incorporating a bank containing no express power of repeal, it
might be difficult to encouiter the objection, that the repealing
law was invalid, as conflicting with the- Constitution of the
Unired States. This arguiient was pressed on this court, in
the case of 'Mumma v. The Potomac Company, (8 Pet.) and it
was met by the following explicit language:

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

811

Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

"We are of opinion, that the dissolution of the corporation,
under the acts of Virginia and Maryland, cannot in any just
sense be considered, within the clause of the Constitution of the
United States on this subject, an impairing of the obligation of
the contracts of the company by those States, any more than
the death of a private person can be said to impair the obliga.
tion of his contracts. The obligation of those contracts sur.
vives; and the creditors may enforce their claims against any
property belonging to the corporation, which has not passed into
the hands of bonl fide purchasers, but is still held in trust fox
the company, or for the stockholders thereof, at the time of its
dissolution, in any mode permitted by the local laws."
Indeed, if it be once admitted that the property of an insolvent trading corporation, while under the management of its
officers, is a trust fund in their hands for the benefit of creditors, it follows, that a court of equity, which never allows a
trust to fail for want of a trust.ee, would see to the execution
of that trust, although by the dissolution of th6 corporation, the
legal title to its property had been changed. Mumma v. The
Potomac Company, 8 Pet. 281; Wright v. Petrie, 1 S.&. A.
Ch. 1. 319; Nevitt v. The Bank of Port Gibson, 6 S. & M. 513;
1 Ed. Ch. R.; S. C. 9 Paige; Read v.. Frankfort Bank, 23
Maine R. 318. And, in this point of view, the decision of this
court, in Lennox et al. v. Roberts, (2 Wheat. 373,) is applicable.
It was a suit in equity, brought by persons to whom, at the
expiration of the charter of the Bank of the United States, its
effects were conveyed by deed, in trust for creditors and stockholders. Among these effects were certain promissory notes
indorsed by the defendant, which the bill prayed he might be
compelled to pay. The complainants had not the legal title
transferred to them by indorsement upon the notes. This court
held that the suit was maintainable. And this decision necessarily involves two points. First. That the expiration of the charter had not released the indorser. Second. That a court of
equity would lend its aid to trustees for creditors of the bank,
to enforce payment .of the notes. We do not think that the
omission of the bank to appoint a trustee, would vary the sub.
stantial rights of creditors in a court of equity.
Whatever technical difficulties exist in maintaining an action
at law by or against a corporation after it6 charter has been repealed, in the apprehension of a court of equity, there is no
difficulty in a creditor following the property of the corporation
into the hands of any one not a bondfide creditor or purchaser,
and asserting his lien thereon, and obtaining satisfaction of his
just debt out of that fund specifically set apart for its payment
when the debt was contzacted and charged with a trust for all

312

SUPREME COURT.
Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

the creditors when in the hands of the corporation; which trust
the repeal of the charter does not destroy. Chancellor Kent,
in 2 Com. 307, n., says, "The rine of the common law has in
fact become obsolete. It has never been applied to insolvent
or dissolved moneyed corporations in England. The sound doctrine now is, as shown by statutes and judicial decisions, that
the capital and debts of banking and other moneyed corporations, constitute a trust fund and pledge for the payment of creditors and stockholders, and a court of equity will lay hold of
the fund, and see that it be duly collected and applied. The
c.ase of Hightower v. Thornton, 8 Georgia R. 491, and other
cases-before referred to in this opinion, are in conformity with
this doctrine; and, in our judgment, a law distributing the property of an insolvent trading or banking corporation among its
stockholders, or giving it to strangers, or seizing it to the use of
the State, would as clearly impair the obligation of its contracts
as a law giving to the heirs the effects of a deceased natural
person, to the exclusion of his creditors, would impair the obligation of his contracts.
But if it could be maintained, that the repeal of the charter
of this corpoi-ation would be operative to destroy the obligation
of its contracts, it would not follow that any thing short of a
repeal could have that effect. The only ground upon which
such a power could be claimed is, that inasmuch as the power
of repeal exists when the contract is made, and inasmuch as the
necessary effect of a. repeal is to put an end to the obligation
of the contracts of the corporation, ail its contracts are made
subject to this contingency, and with an inherent liability to be
thus de5stroyed.' We have already said, that it is not the necessary ffect -of a repeal of the charter to destroy the obligations
of contracts; but if it were, and they were entered into subject
to.this liability, upon what ground could it be maintained, that
merely suspending certain powers of the corporation, its existence being preserved, can be followed by any such consequence?
Surely it is not the negessary effect of a prohibition to transact
new business, ,to destroy contracts already made; and if not,
how can the right and power to destroy them be considered to
wow out of a power to make such a prohibition? or how can
itbe fairly assumed, bepause the creditor knew when he received
the contract of thebank that the legislature could at any time
deprive it of power to enter into new engagements, and therefore must be taken to have assented to the exercise of that
power at the discretion of the legislatre, that he must also be
considered as assenting to the exercise of a totally different
power viz. fhe power to destroy contracts already made? Legislative powers, over contracts lawfully existing when the con-

Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

tracts are formed, affect the nature and enter into the obligations of those contracts. But such powers can be exerted only
in the particular cases in reference to which they have been reserved; and they are inoperative in all other cases. And, until
such a case arises, the obligation of such a contract can no
more be impaired tlhan if it were under no circumstances subject to legislative control. The assumption that, because the
legislature may destroy a contract by repealing the charter of
the corporation which made it, therefore such a contract may
be impaired, or altered, or destroyed, in any manner the legislature may think fit, without repealing the charter, is wholly
inadmissible.
Now the charter of this bank has never been repealed. On
the contrary the 28th section of the act of the 31st day of January, 18413, expressly provided, " That nothing in this act shall
be so construed as to impair or destroy the corporate existence
of the svid Bank of the State of Arkansas, but the charter of
the said institution is only intended to be so limited an& modified as that said bank shall collect in and pay off her debts, abstain from discounting notes, or loaning money, and liquidate
and close up her business as is hereinafter provided." Subsequent laws have still further limited and modified the corporate
powers, but the corporate existence has not been touched, and
the corporation is made a party to this suit, and appears on the
record.
We do not consider, therefore, that the power of the State to
repeal this charter enables the State to pass a law impairing the
obligation of its contracts.
We have thus far considered only the contracts between the
complainant and the bank, arising out of the bills of the bank
held by him, and some of the obligations of those contracts.
But this is not the only contract with the complainant. It is
true.that, as the State was the sole stockholder in this bank, the
charter cannot be deemed to be such a contract between the
State and the corporation as is protected by the Constitution
of the United States. But it is a very different question
whether that charter does not contain provisions, which. when
acted upon by the State and by third persons, constitute in law
a binding cortract with them, the obligation of which cannot
be impaired.
If a person deposit his property in the hands of an agent, he
may revoke the agency and withdraw his property at his pleasure. But if he should request third lpersons to accept the
agent's bills, informing them, at the same time, that he 'had
placed property in the hands of that agent to meet the bills at
their maturity, and upon the faith of such assurance the ggent's
"OL. XV.

27

814

SUPREME COURT.
Currantv. State of Arkansas et al.

bills are accepted,-the principaLcannot, by revoking the agency,
acquire the right to withdraw his property from the hands of
the agent.
.It
is no longer exclusively his. They who, on the faith of its
deposit, have changed their condition, have acquired rights in it.
The matter no longer rests in a mere delegation of a revocable
authority to an agent, but a;contract has arisen between the
principal and. the third persons from the representation made,
and the acts done on the faith of it, and the property cannot be
withdrawn without impairing the obligation of that contract.
Now the charter of this bank provides, .(§ 1,) that it shall
have a capital stock of one million of dollars, to be raised by
the sale of the bonds of'the State, and also, (§ 13,) that certain
other funds,.which are specifically described, shall be deposited
therein by the State, and constitute a part of the capital of the
bank, and the bill avers that the bonds of the State, amounting
to one million of dollars, .and also other bonds of the State
amounting to one hundred and forty-six tbousand dollars, authorized 'by a subsequent act of the Assembly, were sold, and
their proceeds, together with the other funds mentioned, were
paid into the bank to constitute its capital stock.
-The bank received this money from the State as the fund to
meet.is engagements with third persons which the State, by the
charter, expressly authorized it to nale for the profit of the State.
Having thus set apart this fund in the hands of the bank, and
invited the public tO give creditkto it, under an assurance that it
had been placed there forthe pufrpose of paying the liabilities
of the bank;, whenever such credit was gien, a contract between
the State and the creditor not to withdraw that fund, to his injury, at once arose. That the charter, followed by the deposit
to an assurance, held out to the
of.the capital stock, amounted
public by the Stte, that anyone who should trust the bank
might rely on that capital for payment, we cannt doubt. And
when a third person aeted on this assurance, and parted with his
property on the faith of it, the transaction had all the elements
of a binding contract, and the State could not withdraw the
fund, or any part of it, without impairing itas obligation.
We proceed, therefore, to examine the laws complained of, to
of the
obligations

itself a debt; and that the other laws, by force of which all the
real property of the bank was vested in the State, are not to be
deemed to have been passed in denial of the rights of creditors,
but only the better to protect and give effect to those rights;
that the trust in favor of creditors .still subsists, to be worked
out in such manner as the State shall deem proper.
To maintain the first proposition, it must appear that the
State stood in such a relation to this bank and its creditors at
the time these laws were passed; that it was a creditor, and
could provide by law for the payment of its debt in preference
to other creditors; and secondly, that these laws do not withdraw and apply to the use of the State any greater sum than
the amount of such debt.
In our judgment, the State cannot be considered to have
occupied this position. It had placed its bonds in the possession of the bank, -*ith authority to sell them and hold- their
proceeds as capital. It had also paid over to the bank certain
other funds, with an express declaration, contained in the thirteenth section of the charter, that these also were to b- part of
its capital, and were to. have credited to them their proportion
of dividend of the profits of the business. All these moneys
were thus set apart, in the hands of the bank, as a fund, upon
the credit of which it was to issue bills, and which was to be
liable to answer the engaigements of the bank contracted to its
creditors, in the course of the business which it was authorized
to transact for the profit of the State. Such is the necessary
effect of the express declaration 'in the charter, that these funds
constitute the capital of the bank.
'"hen this bank became insolvent, and all its assets were insufficient to perform its engagements, it is manifest that every
part of these assets stood bound by the contracts which had
been made with the bank upon the faith of the funds thus set
apart by the charter; and it is"equally clear, that the bank no
longer had in its possession any capital stock belonging to the
State. 'Whatever losses a bank sustains, are losses of the
capital paid in by its stockholders; that is the.only fund it has
to lose. When it has become insolvent, it has lost all that
fund, and has nothing belonging to its stockholders. In some
sense a bank may be said to be indebted to its stockholders for
the capital they have paid in. With the leave of the State,
they have a right to withdraw it, after all debts are paid, and,
if the State is itself the sole stockholder, it may withdraw its
capital while any of it shall remain. But, from the very nature
of things, it cannot withdraw capital from an insolvent bank,
because it has none of their capital remaining. When insolvent, its assets belong solely to its creditors.

SUPREMiE COURT7.
Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

It is unnecessary, therefore, to decide whrct were the rights and
powers of the State, in respect to any portion of thesefunds,
while the bank continued solvent. When it became insolvent,
when its entire property was insufficient to pay its debts, it no
longer had any capital stock belonging to the State, and, therefore, none could be withdrawn, without appropriating by law
to the use of the State what by the charter stood pledged to
creditors, and such a law impairs the obligations of the contracts
of the bank, and also the obligation of the zontract between the
State and the creditors, arising from the provisions of the
charter devoting these funds to the payment of the debts of
the bank.
In addition to this, it must be observed that the averments
of the bill, which are confessed by the demurrer, show that the
whole amount of the funds mentioned in the thirteenth section
of the charter, which it is claimed the State had the right to
withdraw, was $350,753; and that the amount actually withdrawn and appropriated to the use of the State, was at least
$400,000. On an investigation of the accounts, these averments
might appear to be erroneous; but we are obliged to consider
them to be true, as they are confessed on the record.
Our opinion is, that these laws, which withdraw from the
bank the sum of $400,000, according to ihe averments in the
bill, cannot be supported upon the ground that the State had
the right, as a creditor of the bank, to appropriate these funds
to its own use.
Nor can we find sufficient support for the other position, that
the laws divesting the bank of its property and vesting it in the
State, do not impair the obligations of th6 plaintiff's contracts,
because they were not passed in denial, but in furtherance of
the rights of creditors, and to afford them a remedy, and for the
prevention of further loss.
Passing over the laws which, upon thei: face, not only withdrew funds from the bank, but appropriated those funds to the
use of the State, and which, therefore, cannot be supposed to
be in furtherance of the rights of creditors, or intended to protect them from loss, or not to be in denial. of their rights, to so
much the property of the bank as was thus withdrawn, there
are four acts complained of by the bill, which require examination, with a view to see whether they can be considered as
remedial only, and in that point of view consistent with the
obligations of the contracts of the plaintiff. The first is the act
of January 4, 1845. The seventeenth section of this act is as
follows: "That said financial receivers b 3 required to receive,
in whole or in part Payment of any debt due the bank, the
bonds of the State which weresold in good faith to put said

Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

bank and branches in operation, notwithstanding the outstanding circulation of said bank and its branches may not be taken
UP.,,
We cannot attribute to this provision of law any other
meaning or effect than what is plainly apparent on its face.
It authorizes and requires the assets of the bank to be appropriated to pay debts of the State; and we cannot conceive how
this can be reconciled with the rights of creditors to those assets,
or how it can consistwith the execution of a trust in their favor,
or how it differs from the other laws appropriating the property
of this insolvent bank to the use and benefit of the State.
The circumstances that these bonds were sold by the State,
through the agency of the bank, to obtain funds to constitute
the capital of the bank, do not make them debts of the bank.
They were bonds under the seal of the State, signed by the
governor, and countersigned by the treasurer, containirrg an
acknowledgment that the State of Arkansas stood indebted,
and a promise by'the State to pay. The president and cashier
of the bank are empowered to transfer them by indorsement;
but no liability, even of the conditional character which arises
from the indorsement of negotiable paper by the law merchant,
is attached by the charter to these indorsements, and, from the
nature of the casewe do not see how any such could have been
intended. We do not deem it necessary to determine, whether,.
under the fifteenth section of the charter, the bank was made
liable for the accruing interest on the bonds. It would seem
that this section is merely directory to the general board, and
was intended to provide for the payment of interest out of expected profits; but however this may be, to suppose that the
charter intended the fund raised by the sale of these bonds, and
which it held out to creditors as capital of the bank, could, at
any time, be appropriated to pay thesebonds, leaving the creditors, who had dealt with the bank on the faith of that capital,
wholly unpaid, would be to give it a construction not supported
by any provision which we have been able to discover in it, and
directly in conflict with its manifest purpose and meaning. For
in no fair sense can the bank be considered to have had the
proceeds of these bonds as so much capital, if it was liable, at
the pleasure of the State, to be swept away at any moment to
pay the debts which'the State had contracted to borrow it. In
such a condition of things, these proceeds would be nothing
more than a deposit, payable on demand; and to call*them
capital, and allow the public to trust to them as such, would
involve a plain contradiction.
Indeed, upon this construction of the chqrter, taken in connection with the alleged right to withdraw at pleasure all the other
27*

SUPREME COURT.
Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

funds deposited, the bank had no proper capital which was
bound by its contracts; and this would render it extremely
difficult to maintain the validity of the charter under the tenth
section of the first article of the Constitution of the United
States, prohibiting the States from emitting bills of credit. It
is well known that the power of the several States to create
corporations, to issue bills, and transact business for the sole
benefit of the State which appointed the corporate officers, and
was alone interested in the bank, has been from time to time
seriously questioned. The cases of Briscoe v. The Bank of
Kentucky, 11 Peters, 257, ad Darrington et al. v. The Bank
of Alabama, 13 Howard, 12, have settled this question, in reference to such banks as were involved in those cases. But the
principal ground on which such bills were distinguished from
bills of credit emitted by the State, was, that they do not rest
on the credit of the State, but on the credit of the corporation
derived from its capital stock.
But if the charter of the .bank has not provided any fund,
effectually chargeable with the redemption of its bills, if what
is called its capital is liable to be withdrawn at the pleasure of
the State, though no means of redeeming the bills should remain,
then the bills rest wholly upon the faith of the State and not
upon the credit o! the corporation, founded on its property.
We do not perceive, in the charter of the State Bank of Arkansas,
an intention.to create such a bank and emit such bills; on the
contrary we think it plainly appears to have been intended to
make a bank having a real capital, on the credit of 'which its
business was to be transacted; and this intention is necessarily
in conflict with the existence of the power anywhere to appropriate the funds of the bank, after it became insolvent, to pay
debts of the State contracted to borrow the. money which constituted that capital.
By the act of December 23, 1846, the fine.ncial receivers were
authorized in certain cases to pay judgmert creditors in notes
of non-resident debtors, provided such judgment creditors would
convey to the State all lands of the bank on which they had
levied; and by another act, passed on the same day, all conveyances of real estate purchased for, or taken in payment of, any
debt due to the bank, were required to be made to the State, and
all such titles were declared to be vested in the State. The
second section of this law is in the following words: " That
the governor is hereby authorized to exchange any property, so
taken by the said bank, for an equal amo-ant of the bonds of
the State executed for the benefit of said istitution ;.provided
that such 'property shall not be exchariged with the holders of
such bonds at less prices than were allowed by the bank for the

DECEMBER TER9, 1863.

319

Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

same, and that the governor be authorized to make titles and
give acquittances for the same; and this act shall take effect and
be in force from and after its passtge."1
If this law had contained only the frst section vesting the
real property of the bank in the State, and providing no remedy
by which this complainant, as a creditor of the bank, could
reach it, we think it would have impaired the obligation of his
contracts. True, it does not touch the right of action against
the bank; if only withdraws the real property from the reach
of legal process, and thus affects the remedy.- But it by no
means follows, because a law affects only the remedy, that it
does not impair the obligation of the .contract. The obligation
of a contract, in the sense in which those words are used in the
Constitution, is that duty of performing it, which'is recognized
and enforced by the laws. And if the law is so changed that
the means of legally enforcing this duty are materially impaired,
the obligation of the contract no longer remains the, same.
This has been the doctrine of this court from a very early
period. In Green-v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1, Mr. Justice Washington, delivering the opinion of the court, said: "It is no answer
that the acts of Kentucky now in question, are regulations of
the remedy and not of the right to the lands. If these acts so
change the nature and extent of existing remedies as materially
to impair the rights and interests of the owner, they are just as
much a violation of the compact as if they directly overturned
his rights and interests." In Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311,
M. Chief Justice Taney, delivering the opinion of the court,
and speaking of the above rule, as laid down in Green v. Biddle,
said: " We concur entirely in the porrectness of the rule above
stated. The remedy is the part of the municipal law which
protects the right, and the obligation by which it enforces and
maintains it. it is this protection which this clause in the Constitution was mainly intertded to secure."
The difficulty of determining, in some cases, whether the
change in the remedy has materially impaired the rights and interest of the creditor, must be admitted. But we do not think
any such difficulty exists in this case. The decision of this court
in McCracken v. Hayward, 2 How. 608, must be considered as
settling this question. In that case the law under consideration
provided that a sale should not be made of property levied on
under an execution, unless it would bring. two thirds of its
valuation by three householders. It was held that such a law,
so obstructed the remedy as to impair the obligtion of the con-.
tract. The law now in question certainly presents a far more
serious obstruction, for it withdraws the real property of the
bank altogether from the reach of legal process, provides no

320

SUPREM1E COURT.
Curran v. State of Arkansas et al.

substituted remedy, and leaves the creditor, as is truly said by
the Supreme Court of Arkansas, in its opinion in this case, "in
a condition in which his rights live but in grace, and his remedies in entreaty only."
But not only does this law withdraw the real property from
the bank, and vest it in the State, but by the second section, the
terms of which have been given, the property so withdrawn is
expressly appropriated to pay the bonds of the State. An appropriation, which, as has been above stated, cannot be reconciled with the preservation of the rights of creditors, whether
those rights are to be protected by existing legal remedies, or in
any other manner.
The same observations apply to so much of the act of the
9th of January, 1849, as required the officers of the bank to receive in payment of debts due to the bank, bonds of the State
issued to obtain capital to put in operation the Real Estate
Bank of the State of Arkansas, which bonds are averred in the
bill to have amounted to $2,000,000. If a law which withdrew
assets of the bank to pay bonds sold to raise its capital, impaired the obligation of the complainant's contracts, it would
probably not be supposed that a law applying such assets to
pay bonds of the State sold to raise capital for another bank,
could be free from that objection.
It only remanms to consider the third question: whether it appears by the record that the Supreme Court of Arkansas held
these laws to be valid, and by reason thereof dismissed the
complainant's bill.
Each of thpse laws is specifically referred to in the bill, and
its operation upon the.property of the bank averred, and made
a subject of complaint. If a private person had received assets
of the bank in the same manner they are alleged in the bill to
have been received by the State, he must have been held amenable to the complainants as a creditor of the bank, in a court
of equity. We have already stated that, by the local law of
Arkansas, the State stands in the same predicament as a private
person, in respect to being chargeable as a trustee, unless it is
exempted by force of the laws in question It necessarily follows, therefore, that the Supreme Court of the State hela these
laws valid, and that by force of them the State was not subject
to the principles upon which it would otherwise have been
chargeable.,
It is sufficient, to give this court jurisdiction under the 25th
section of the judiciary act, that it appears by the record that
the question, whether a law of a State impaired the obligation
-of a contract, was necessdrily involved in the decision; and that
such law was held to be valid, and the decision made against

the plaintiff in error by reason of its supposed validity. Armstrong v. The Treasurer of Athens County, 16 Peters, 281';
Crowell v. Randell, 10 Peters, 392; McKenney v. Carroll, 12
Peters, 66.
The result is, that so much of each of the said laws of the
State of Arkansas, as authorized and required the cancellation
of the bonds of the State, given for money borrowed of the Bank
of the State of Arkansas, or authorized and required the withdrawal of any part of the specie or other property of that bank,
and the appropriation thereof to the use of the State, or authorized and required the application of any part of the assets or
property of that bank to pay bonds issued by the State and sold
to raise capital for the Bank of the State of Arkansas, or for the
Real Estate Bank of the State of Arkansas, or authorized and
required real property purchased for the Bank of the State of
Arkansas, or taken in payment of debts due to the Bank of the
State of Arkansas to be conveyed to and the title thereof vested
in the State of Arkansas, impaired the obligation of contracts
made with the complainant as the lawful holder and bearer of'
bills of the Bank of the State of Arkansas, and so were inoperative and in-valid. And, consequently, the judgment of the Supreme Court of that State must be reversed, and the cause remanded, that it may be proceeded in as the Constitution of the
United States requires.
Mr. Justice CATRON, lr. Justice DANIEL, and Mr. Justice NELSON, dissented.
Mr. Justice CATRON.
As this case comes up from a State court under the 25th
section of the judiciary act, the first question presented is,
whether we have jurisdiction to decide the merits; and I am of
opinion, that no violation of any contract rendered, which the
complainant sets vp a right to recover, has occurred within the
sense of the Constitution, by the laws passed by the State of
Arkansas, and which laws are complained of in the bill.
On the merits, I have formed no opinion, not having authority
to inquire into them, as I apprehend
Mr. Justice. DANIEL.
From the decision of this court, just announced 1 am constrained to declarc my dissent. According to my apprehension
there is no legitimate ground of jurisdiction and of course for
the interference of this court in this case, within the just intent
and objects of the 10th section of the 1st article of the Cbnstitution. By the legislature of the State of Arkansas, '-hich has

322

'SUPREME COURT.
Curran i7. State of Arkansa3 et al.

been assailed, the obligation of no contract is denied. The claims
of every stockholder and every noteholder of the Bank of the
State of Arkansas are, in reference to that corporation, fully
recognized. The utmost that can .be ojected to the action
of the State is, that in a contest amongst the creditors of
a failing corporation, the State, as one oF those creditors, and
the largest creditor of the number, may have appropriated to
herself a portion of the- assets of that corporation greater than
would have been warranted by perfect equity, or other eauality,
amongst all the creditors. But should thi: conclusion be con-.
ceded, the concession implies no attempt to deny or impair
any obligation of the bank to satisfy every creditor. It might
raise a question of fraud or unfairness in tLe action of the State
in reference to the other creditors of the bank, but it carries with
it no interference with the obligation or the sanctity of their contract with the corporation, whatever that irdght be. The mere
question of fraud, in the execution or non..performance of contracts, surely the Constitution never intended to constitute as a
means by which the federal authorities were to supervise the
polity and acts of the State governmenti. Such a claim of
power in the federal govemment'would justify the interference
with, and the supervision by this court of any act of the State
legislatures, and of every transaction of pilvate life, and in the
necessarily imperfect attempts to exercise inch a power, would
encumber it with a mass of business, which would disappoint
and entirely prevent the performance of its legitimate duties.
