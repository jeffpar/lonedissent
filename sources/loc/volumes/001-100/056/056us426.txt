SUPREME

COURT.

Den v. Jersey Company.

JOHN DEN, EX DEMa. ARCHIBA ,D RUSSELL; PLAINTIFF IN ERROR,
v. THE ASSOCIATION OF THE JERSEY COMPANY.
The soil under the public navigable waters of East New Jersey belongs to the State
and not to the proprietors. This court so decided in the case of Martin v. Vaddell,
16 Peters, 367; and the principle covers a case where land has been reclaimed from
the water under an P.ct of the Legislature.

THIS case was brought up by writ of error from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of New Jersey.
The action of ejectment was brought to recover a tract of
land at Paulus Hook, now Jersey City, on the Jersey shore,
formerly under the tide waters of the Hudson river, and below
low-water mark. The locus in q o has been reclaimed from the
water by artificial means, and was in the possession of the Jersey Associates, and occupied by them as building lots.
Upon the trial in the Circuit Court it was ruled that the plaintiff had failed to make out a title, and the jury found for the
defendants.
The plaintiff excepted to the opinion of the court and the
cause came up on a writ of error.

It was argued by Thr. Rutherford and Nt. Van antvoord, for
the plaintiff in error, and by 3&. Zabriskie and Mr. Scudder, for
the defendants.
The title of the plaintiff in error was derived from the proprietors of East New Jersey, who claimed under a grant from
Charles the Second to his brother James, Duke of York, in 1664.
The proprietors living in 1.776 having espoused the cause of
the Americans, in the struggle of the Revolution, their property was not confiscated; and they are sill recognized by the
$tate of New Jersey as an existing body, for many purposes.
They own a considerable quantity of unappropriated land, which
is exempt from taxation.
The argument of the case in this court covered a great deal
of ground upon both sides; but as the decision of the court
turned upon a single point, viz. that the main feature of the
case had been adjudicated upon in Martin v. Waddell, 16 Peters,
367, it is not deemed necessary to do more than state the argument made by counsel to show the difference between the two
cases.

Mr. ran Santvoord,one of the counsel fo: the plaintiff in error,
thus noticed the point:

DI CEMBER TERM, 1853.

427

Den v. Jersey Company.

We are to show, therefore, that the propriety'in the soil under
the navigable waters of New Jersey, passed to the Duke of
York and his grantees, and that it passed not as one of the
regalia of the crown, or as a concomitant of government, but
as an absolute proprietary interest, subject, it is true, to every
lawful public use; but not the less on that account a hereditament, and the subject of lawful ownership and of the right of
full and unqualified possession when that public use shall have
ceased.
In examining the question it will be necessary, first, to remove
an obstacle which is encountered at the very threshold of the
discussion. It is contended, and the circuit judge so charged
the jury, that the matter is already res adjudicata, and that the
decision in Martin and others v. Waddell involves the very
point in controversy. If this be so, the discussion, of course, is
at an end. For though a decision like that of Arnold v. Mundy, 1 Halst. 1, in a State court is not conclusive, yet an adjudication by this court of the very subject-matter of the controversy
is; and we are not at liberty to question it, or permitted to look
beyond the rule and the decision in the particular case for the
reason upon which such decision is founded.
We contend, then, that the question presented by the present
case was not necessarily involved, and certainly not passed
upon, in Martin v. Waddell, nor was it in Arnold v. 'Mundy.
Our claim is perfectly consistent with the actual decisions in
both cases, and is even fortified by those decisions. I shall,
therefore, briefly consider what was really decided in Martin v.
Waddell, and point out the distinction between that and the
present case. And,
First. This is an Ejectment for lands reclaimed from the bed
of a navigable river, and in the actual possession of the defendant
as building lots. Martin v. Waddell was an ejectment for lands
still under wzater, in the constructive possession of the defendant
as a fishery.
Ejectment is a possessory action, and the suit is brought to
recover the possession, in the one case of the fishery, or the use
of the land, in the other case of the land itself.
&cond. In Martin v. Waddell, the only possession of which
the locus in quo (being then under water) was susceptible, was
in its capacity of a public easement, or highway for navigation,
or for fishery, and their correspoiident uses. The only possession withheld by the defendant, and claimed by the plaintiff,
was the use of the locus in quo as a fishery. The decision in
that case was, that the plaintiff was not entitled to such possession, because he had not an exclusive right to such use or possession; but the question of the ultimate fee in the soil, or jus
.proprietatis,was not involved.

428

SUPREME COURT.
Den v. Jersey Company.

This position may be illustrated by supposing the possession
claimed by the plaintiff, and withheld by the defendant, to have
been the exclusive use of the soil and waters for navigation.
The defendant being in possession by his boats, rafts, &c., the
plaintiff seeks to oust him by an ejectmenb; and must fail, for
the same reason that he failed in Martin v. Waddell, because
navigation being a jus publicumw, the defendant had a right, in
common with every other citizen, to be there. But no one will
pretend that such a decision would carry with it the more important one, in respect to the fee of the soil. So in Martin v.
Waddell, the franchise of fishery is elevated into ajus publicum,
and placed upon the same-footing with navigation. The plaintiff, by an ejectment, can no more be put in exclusive possession
of it, than he could of an exclusive right of navigation in a
public river, because it is not susceptible of ownership.
Third. It makes no difference that the action was technically
brought for the land under water. The sole and only controversy was in respect to the claim set up by the plaintiff's
lessor of an exclusive right of fishing, and nothing else was
passed upon in the case. Ejectment cannot be brought for a
shery eo womine; but if a fishery be claimed, the action must
be brought for the land covered with water. Thom. Co. Litt.
p. 200.
Thus, also, ejectment will not lie for a watercourse, but the
ground over which the water passes, being deliverable in execution, upon which an entry can be effected, may be recovered in
this action. Challoner v. Thomas, Yelv. 143; see also Jackson
vi Buel_ 9 Johns. 298; Jackson v. May, 16 Johns. 184.
It was formerly held that a franchise of fishery, being an incorporeal hereditament, and not susceptible of delivery, could
not be recovered in ejectminent, (Cro. Jac. 144, Cro. Car. 492);
and it is now only upon the assumption +hat a fishery is a tenement, and may be delivered in possession, that an ejectment
will lie to recover it. Saund. P1. & Bv. 981.
Fourth. These distinctions were taken and strongly urged in
Martin v. Waddell by the counsel who argued the case against
the proprietors. He says:.
"The plaintiff, to recover, must maintain two positions,1. That he has a possessory title to the premises in question,
the soil of this navigable- river. And,
2. That there was not a common right of fishery in the people
at large in the premises in question."
He must maintain both positions. A mere title to the sail
would not enable him to recover. It must be' a possessory tile,
and that, too, to the exclusion of every other right of possession,
including the common right of the people at large to use the.

Den v. Jersey Company.

locus in quo as a fishery. Accordingly, in another part of his
argument, the counsel remarks: "A question has arisen whether
the King of England can grant the soil of the sea and its~arms,
so as to destroy or prejudice public rights. Not considering this
question at all material to the main argument, I have purposely
left it out." The question, therefore, of the title to the soil was
not presented by counsel, or passed upon by the court.
F fth. That it was the use of the water as a fishery, and not
the title to the land, that was in question, is manifest also from
the opinion of the court. "It appears," says the Chief Justice,
"that the principal matter in dispute is the right to the oyster
fishery in the public rivers and bays of East New Jersey." Justice Thompson, in his dissenting opinion, attempts, indeed, to
show that it was the use of the land, and not of the water as a
fishery, that was in controversy, making a distinction between
fishing for floating fish, and dredging for oysters, but this view
was not concurred in. "Should it be admitted," he says, "that
the right to fish for floating fish was included in this public
right, it would not decide the present question," that is, the propriety in the soil. The whole argument goes to show, as was
stated by the counsel for the State, that the question presented"
was not as to the power of the king "to grant the soil, so as to
give an individual the right to take it after its character had
been changed by alluvion, wharfing out, &c.;" but the power
of the king "to grant it, so as to vest in an individual the soil,
and divested of all common use before the change takes place."
If, therefore, the right to fish for both shell-fish and floating fish
be such "common use," as was held in that case, the present
question remains still untouched.
Sixth. The actual decision in the case of Martin v. Waddell,
as I have endeavored to show, establishes nothing -more than
this, namely, that the particular right or claim in controversythe possession of an oyster fishery-could not be recovered in
an action of ejectment, because an oyster fishery, like every
other fishery in navigable waters, was a part of the jure regalia
-a royalty-a necessary attribute of government, and, as such,
did not pass under the grant as private property, but became
disconnected from the proprietary interest, and passed out of
the crown with the surrender of government to Queen Anne.
If there be any thing else in the opinion delivered in that case,
it is not conclusive or binding as authority. But we contend
that there is nothing in that opinion which goes further than
this; for though it does not, in express terms, discriminate between the "dominion and propriety in the navigable waters, and
in the soils under them," but connects them together, yet the
whole scope of the argument seems to show that it was the

430

Den v. Jersey Company.

franchise of fishery alone which Chief Justice Taney held had
passed "as a part of the prerogative rights annexed to the political powers conferred on the duke;" and that the question of
the ultimate fee, or propriety in the soil, subject to the public
use, was not considered as influencing the decision.
And lastly - When it is said, in the opinion of the court, that
the navigable waters and the soils under them passed as a royalty incident to the forms of government, "to be held in the same
manner and for the same purposes that the navigable waters of
England, and the soils under them are held by the crown," the
whole question as to what is properly the domain of the crown,
which is alienable as a private interest to a subject, and what is
the common property which is inalienable, save as a trust necessarily incident to government, is left open, except so far as that
it is undoubtedly decided by the case in question, that the
waters. of a public river in respect to thEir use, including the
publicright of fishery in all its branches, is a part of this common
property and is inalienable. This was precisely the point taken
and the decision made in Arnold v. Mundir, 1 Halst. 1.
We maintain, then, that the soil under navigable waters, disconnected from its public use, is part of the domain of the
crown. And this leads at once to the main point in controversy.
The locus in quo, a portion of the bed of the Hudson river,
passed.to the Duke of York and his assigns, not as a royalty
annexed to the political powers conferred upon the duke by the
patent, but as an absolute propriety in the soil, subject to the
public uses of navigation, &c., and also, subject to the public
right of fishery, and every thing necessarily incident to such right.
This might, and perhaps would include tha right of anchorage,
the right to erect wharves, docks, &c., and every other use of
the soil necessary to facilitate commerce and render the navigable water serviceable as an easement or public highway; as
well as the right to make every proper use of the soil for the
purposes of fishery, not inconsistent with the regulations of the
sovereign power, in this case the State, in respect thereto. If
this proposition can be successfully maintained, the proprietary
title is established, and the right of the plaintiff to recover must
be admitted.
This is the main, and indeed it may be said the only, question presented by this ease; and, I propose to discuss it with a
specific reference to the decision in Martin v. Waddell; yielding
as I do to that decision an unqualified assent.
Let us set out with the undeiliable proposition conceded m
the case of Martin v. Waddell, and as expressed in the prevailing opinion of the court, that the "right of the king to make
this grant with all its prerogatives and powers of government,

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

431

Den v. Jersey Company.

cannot, at this day, be questioned." That is, the entire grantthe proprietary interest, and the powers of government, together
with the royalties necessarily incident and annexed to the
powers of government. They all passed to the duke and his
heirs and assigns in the same manner as they were held by the
king himself, and of course the twenty-four proprietors so held
them. Nothing, either of property or dominion in New Jersey,
remained in the king.
The important question then arises, and the question which
must be decisive of this case, how and in what capacity, under
the Constitution and laws of England, were lands under navigable waters, either in public rivers or arms of- the sea, held by
the king, and what was his power over them? Were they held
as a proprietary and alienable interest, the subject of an exclusive
possession as the proper domain of the king when the public
servitude had ceased? Or were they held by the king in the capacity of trustee merely for the public, and, like the franchise of
fishery, &c., inalienable by grant or otherwise from the king to
a subject to be held as private property?
Chief Justice Taney very properly and truly remarks, in Martin v. Wadaell, that, "in deciding a question like this, the laws
and institutions of England, the history of the times, the object of the charter, the contemporanous construction given to it,
and the usage under it, for the century and more which has
elapsed, -are all entitled to consideration and weight."
Pursuing pre-;sely this course, let us examine the question in
the same way, namely:
1st. By the laws and institutions of England.
2d. By the history of the times.
3d. By the objects of the charter, the contemporanous coxistruction given to it and the usages under it, &c., &c., &c.
The counsel for defendants in error thus stated the point.
Sixth Pohzt. That the Supreme Court of New Jersey and the
Supreme Court of the United States, have both expressly decided that the Board of East Jersey Proprietors, the grantors in this
case, under whom Russell claims title, had no right or title to,
and could not grant the soil under tide waters bounded by the
shores of New Jersey. The plaintiff's title, or proprietary title,
in this case, is precisely the same as in Arnold v. Mundy and in
Martin v. Waddell's Lessee. In this case the position of the
defendants is stronger, as they are riparian- owners, and have
wharfed out from their own lands, under the express authority
of the act of the legislature incorporatingthem. Arnold v. Mundy,
1 Halst. 1; Martin et al. v. Waddell's Lessee, 16 Peters, 369.

432

SUPREME COURT.
Den v. Jersey Company.

Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an action of ejectment brought by the plaintiff in error
against the defen*dants in the Circuit Court for the district of
New Jersey, to recover a parcel of land situate in Jersey City.
The land in question has been reclaimed from the water, by the
defendants, under the authority of the legislature; and is now
in their possession, and occupied by them as building lots.
The plaintiff claims the premises under sundry mesne convey.
andes from the Proprietors of East New JErsey, and the title of
the proprietors is the point in question. And they claim that,
by virtue of the various grants by which they became proprietors of East New Jersey, the fee of the soil under the navigable
waters of that part of the State was conveyed to them, as private property subject to the public use; a.nd as that use has
ceased in the premises in question, they are entitled to their exclusive possession.
It is not necessary to state particularly the charters and grants
under which they claim. They are all seL out in the special
verdict in the case of Martin v. Waddell, reported in 16 Pet.
367. The title claimed on behalf of the proprietors in that case
was the same with the title upon which the. plaintiff now relies.
And upon very full argument and consideration in the case
referred to, the court were of opinion that th3 soil under the publie navigable waters of East New Jersey belonged to the State
and not to the proprietors; and upon that ground gave judgment
for the defendant. The decision in that case must govern this.
The counsel for the plaintiff, however, endeavor to distinguish
the case before us from the former one, upon the ground that
nothing but the right of fishery was decided. in Martin v. Waddell; and not the right to the soil. But they would seem to
have overlooked the circumstance that it was an action of
ejeetment for the land covered with water. It was not an action
for disturbing the plaintiff in a right of fishery; but an action to
recover possession of the soil itself. And in giving judgment
for the defendant the court necessarily decided upon the title to
the soil.
It is true, the defendant claimed nothing iore than the exclusive right of planting and growing oysters cn the soil for which
the ejectment was brought. The special verdict found that he
was in possession under f. law of New Jersey, which gave him
the exclusive privilege of planting and growing oysters, on.the
premises in question upon the payment of a certain rent to the
State. The principle question therefore in dispute between the
parties in that suit, and indeed the only one of any value was
the oyster fishery. But the right to the fishery depended. on.the
right to the soil upon which the oysters were planted and grown;

DECEMBER TERM,

Foley v. Harrison et al.

and if the plaintiff could have shown that the proprietors, under
whom he claimed, were legally entitled to it, the judgment of
the court must have been in his favor.
Nor do we see any thing in the opinion delivered on that occasion, in relation to the rights of fishery, further than they contributed to illustrate the character and objects of the charter to
the Duke of York; and to show that the soil, under public and
navigable waters, was granted to him, not as private property,
to be parcelled out and sold for his own personal emolument;
but as a part of the jur, regalia with which he was clothed,
and as such was surrendered by the proprietors to the English
crown, when they relinquished the powers of government, and
consequently belonged to the State of New Jersey when it became an independent sovereignty.
There being nothing in the title now claimed for the proprietors, to distinguish this case from that of Martin v. Waddell, it
is not necessary to examine the other and further grounds of
defence taken by the defendants.
The judgment of the circuit court must be affirmed with
costs.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the Circuit Court of the United States, for the District of
New Jersey, and was argued by counsel. On considerationwhereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged, by this court, that the
judgment of the said Circuit Court, in this cause, be, and the
the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.

HARRISON, DEFENDANT, AND Louis LESASSIER, INTERVENOR.
In 1841, Congress passed an act (5 Stat. at Large, 455) declaring that there shall be
granted to each State, &c., (Louisiana being one,) five hundred thousand acres of
land.
This act did not convey the fee to any lands whatever; but left the land system of
the United States in full operation as to regulation of titles, so as to prevent ccnflicting entrie..

Hence, where a plaintiff claimed under a patent from the State of Louisiana, and
entries only in the United States office; and the defendant claimed under patents
from the United States, the title of the latter is the better in a petitory action.

The defendant has also the superior equity; because his entries were prior in time to
those of the plaintiff, and the decision of a board, consisting of the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Attorney-General, and the Commissioner of the Land Office, to whom
the matter had been referred by an act of Congress, was in favor of the defendant.
