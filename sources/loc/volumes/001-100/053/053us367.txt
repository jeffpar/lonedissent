record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia, and on the points or questions on which
the judges of said Circuit Court were opposed in opinion, and
which were certified to this court for its opinion, agreeably to
the act of Congress in such case made and provided, and was
argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is the opinion
of this court-1st. That the said Circuit Court ought not to
have received the evidence of Clements in behalf of the prisoner;
and that the refusal of the court to admit his testimony does not
entitle the prisoner to a new trial; and 2dly. That the facts
stated in the affidavits of the jurors do not entitle the prisoner
to a new trial. Whereupon it is now here ordered and adjudged
by this court, that it be so certified to the said Circuit Court.

JoHN H. BENNETT AND E. P. HUNT, ADMINISTRATORS OF JOHN
D. AMIS, DECEASED, APPELLANTS, V. SAMUEL F. BUTTERWORTH,
AND MARY EMILY, HIS WIFE.
Where slaves are in the possession of a mortgagee, who renders an account of the
profits of their labor and the expenses which he has incurred on their behalf, he must
be held bound to exercise a reasonable diligence in keeping them engaged in useful
employments.
It is not a sufficient excuse for allowing them to remain idle, to say that he managed
them as they had been managed by their former master, the mortgagor.
If the mortgagee is charged with their hire from a period commencing three months
after the death of the mortgagor, he is not charged too much.
Where the account of the master charged the mortgagee with a certain sum for their
hire, exclusive of clothing, medical treatment, or other expenses, it was a correct
mode of stating the account.

THIs was an appeal from the District Court of the United
States for the District of Texas.
The facts are fully stated in the opinion of the court.

It was argued by 111r. Harris and 31r. Crittenden, for the appellants, and by ilIr. Howard, for the appellees.
Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal in chancery from the decree of the District
Court for the District of Texas.
Butterworth and wife filed their bill against Bennett, and also
against Hunt, who is administrator of Amis, representing that
Amis, the father of Mrs. Butterworth, conveyed to her by deed,
or bill of sale under seal, in consideration of natural love and
affection, certain negroes named, on the 8th of April, 1846.
That, a short time afterward, Amis died, and that Hunt, the

defendant, administered upon his estate. That, on application
to the administrator for the slaves, it was found they were in
possession of Bennett, the other defendafit, who claimed to hold
them by an absolute bill of sale, executed in June, 1845, by the
said Amis, and that the slaves were, and had been, from the
date of the bill of sale or shortly afterward, in the possession
and under the control of Bennett, who received the profits of
their hire. That the negroes were transferred to him to secure
an ifidebtment, and also to secure future advances. The negroes
were demanded of Bennett, but he refused to surrender them,
on the ground thht his debt had not been paid.
In his answer, the defendant, Bennett, says, the negroes were
in his possession at the death of Amis; that he is unwilling to
surrender the possession of them until his claim shall be fully
satisfied; he denies that the proceeds of the labor of the slaves
were sufficient to discharge his debt, &c.
The defendant, Hunt, in his answer, states that, on the 1st
April, 1846, in the lifetime of Anis, matters of difference between him and'Butterworth were submitted to the arbitament
of James H. Smith and W. W. Humphries, who awarded that
Butterworth should deliver to John D. Amis two negro men
named, or pay $2,500; that other negroes should be delivered
and certain moneys paid by Butterworth, and that he should do
certain other things, &c.; and that Amis, on his part, should
transfer all the interest he might have to any portion of the
estate formerly owned by him, to Mary E. Butterworth, wife of
the complainant. And he alleges that Butterworth did not comply with the award on his part; and the defendant asks that he
may be compelled to perform it; and that the bill of sale by
Aimis to Mrs. Butterworth, of the negroes, was given in pursuance of this award.
It appears that John D. Amis and William D. Amis, on the
15th of December, 1839, by an indenture, conveyed to Andrew
Harris and others, their creditors, to whom they owed debts
amounting to $73,269.88, a large amount of real and personal
property, to secure the payment of that sum. A large number
of negroes were included in this transfer.
Bennett also pleaded in bar the recovery of a judgment b-y
Butterwor h against defendant in the District Court, for the negroes named in the amended bill, or, if the same could not be
had, it was adjudged that he should recover twelve hundred dollars, the value of the negroes.
The court made an interlocutory decree, that the bill of sale
was a mortgage, and that the complainants had a right to redeem,
&c.; and James Love was appointed to take an account of the
amount due Bennett on the mortgage, and also to take an

account of the hire of the negro slavps in the possession and
under the control of Bennett; and the master was directed to
credit him with any extraordinary expenditures which were
necessary on account of the health of the neand also
for rearing the children, &c.; and that the mas
-hould report, &c.
A report was made by the master, as directed, which showed
that the mortgage-money and interest had been paid by the hire
of the negroes, &c., and that a balance was due to the complainant of $318.90.
Exceptions were 'taken to this report, which were overruled
by the court, and a decree was entered confirming the report,
and ordering the sum found due to the complainants to be paid,
and that the negroes in controversy, in the hands of a receiver,
should be delivered to the complainants.
On this appeal, the rulings of the court, on the exceptions
taken, are the points to be considered.
The first exception is that, in his report, the master states:
"The defendant has filed and proved an account marked No. 1,
of the receipts and expenditures under the mode of management
in said report stated, which he did not investigate," as he assumed a different mode of management to have been necessary
to exempt the defendant, by the terms of the decree, from "wilful default."
In his report, the master says: "It appears in evidence that
Bennett treated the slaves with unusual indulgence and humanity, and in the manner that was pursued by Amis in his lifetime.
He rented houses for them, furnished them food and clothbig with great liberality, and proper medical attendance when
necessary. That he sometimes hired them by the day, and
sometimes by the month. It is also in proof, that the negroes
frequently hired themselves to others, and were paid by their
employers."
The defendant having possession of the slaves, and an entire
control over'them, was bound to exercise a reasonable diligence
in keeping them engaged in useful employments, so as not only
to pay their necessary expenses, but also to obtain a reasonable
compensation for their labor. That he treated them with
humanity, provided for their wants, and made them comfortable, is not sufficient. Nor is it a sufficient excuse for him to
say that he managed the slaves as they had been managed by
Amis, their master. Bennett held them as a pledge, and he was
not at liberty to indulge them in idleness, as their master may
have done. In his peculiar relation, as trustee, he had active
duties to perform; and we think the master did right in rejecting the account rendered, under a management which showed,

on his part, gross negligence, or in the language -of the interlo.
cutory decree, "wilful default."
It appears that Amis died on the 1st of August, 1847, at
which time the slaves were in the possession of Bennett, and
continued to be in his possession at the time the account was
taken. Three months were allowed by the master, after the
death of Amis, before the account commences; and as there
was considerable sickness at Galveston, where the slaves were
situated, "he allowed one hundred dollars as extraordinary ekpenditures for medical attendance, food, house-rent, and nursing."
And he says he allowed nothing for medicine or medical bills,
except during the prevalence of the yellow fever, because the
allowance for hire was made on a basis which covered all deductions for loss of time or Other contingenciEs.
The second exception is, that the master in an account, No.
2, filed by him, stated the charge for hire of the slaves as
commencing on the 1st of November, 1847, when he was restricted from making such charge prior to the 20th of March,
1849.
No such restriction is perceived in the answer of Bennett, nor
in any othc r part of the proceeding. It seems that Bennett was
in possession of the slaves before the death of Amis, and as is
alleged in the answer, at least a part of the hire was paid to
Amis during his life. But the account for the hire is made to
commence three months after his death, at which time it is admitted the estate of Amis was indebted to Bennett $1,433.72.
The third and last exception to the report is, "that the master, in account No. 2, filed, states a balance due complainants on
the 1st of June, 1850, of $318.90, which is contrary to the evidence of complainants and defendant now filed with said report
marked No. 3 and No. 4; and hath not, in his said report, allowed and credited the defendant the expenses proved. to have been
incurred in the management of the slaves.
As this exception refers to the evidence before the master, we
have examined it, and although there s a discrepancy between
some of the witnesses as to the hire of the slaves, yet the weight
of evidence seems to be in favor of the report of the master. He
made no special allowance for expenses; medical or otherwise,
as he stated the allowance for the service of the slaves, at a sum
which such services were proved to be worth, clear of all deductions for clothing, loss of time, or medical treatment.
It is probable that the sum allowed by the master exceeded,
considerably, the actual money received for the hire of the slaves.
But the negligence or want of attention by Bennett, in giving
indulgence to the slaves, or in failing to have them suitably employed, should not excuse him from an equitable charge of what

they could have earned. On this basis the master acted in
making out the account, and we think it was properly assumed
by him. And in this view there appears to be no error or mistake in the account stated, which should have prevented the District Court from sanctioning it.
The charges by Bennett for the superintendence and management of the slaves, were not allowed by the master, nor the
charge for commissions. These items, if the defendant were
entitled to an equitable allowance for the services stated, would
amount only to a small sum, and we think, under all the circumstances of the case, neither this omission, nor the other
exceptions to the report of the master, are of a character to
require the reversal of this decree.
There was no action on the plta in bar filed by Bennett,
which is an irregularity, not important, however, to be noticed
on the appeal. Nor does it appear that any notice was taken in
the District Court of the award set up in his answer by Hunt,
the administrator. As the consideration for the transfer of the
slaves by Amis to his daughter was natural love and affection,
as appears by the bill of sale, it could not have been considered
as within the award stated.
The decree of the District Court is affirmed with costs.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the District Court of the United States for the District of Texas, and was argued by counsel. On consideration
whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this
court, that the decree of the said District Court in this cause
be, and the sam.e is hereby, affirmed with costs.
