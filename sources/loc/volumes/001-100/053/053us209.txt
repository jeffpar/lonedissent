THE

UNITED STATES, A-PPELLANTS,

V. MICHAEL MOORE.

An historical account given as to what officer in Louisiana possessed the power to
grant part of the king's domain.
In September, 1797, Morales, who was intendant, had not the power. And a receipt.
of that date, given by him for the purchase-money of lands sold, could convey
no title.
By the regulations of O'Reilly, made in 1770, the front proprietora of land upon the
Mississippi were bound to make mounds or levees, and also to clear and ditch the
whole front of the depth of two arpents, within three years from the date of their
purchases. In default thereof, the land reverted to the king.
This condition not having been complied with in the present ease, and the alleged
proprietor nothaving asserted any claim from 1797 to 1835, the presumption is that
he surrendered his purchase and had his money refunded.
The claim is also barred by lapse of time.
The District Court decreed that "in case any of the lands claimed by the petitioner
should have been sold by the United States, he, the petitioner, should be authorized
to enter, in any land-office in the State of Louisiana, a like quantity of public lands.'
Thi' decree was erroneous. The act of 1844 revived the act of 1824, but did
not revive the act of 1828; and the act of 1824 required the grantees of the
United States to be made parties in order that they might come in and defend
their title. It also intended that these grantees should produce their titles, so
that the court might ascertain their boundaries and quantities, and decree accordingly. But in the decree in question, this was not done.

THIS was an appeal from the District Court of the United
States, for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
The act, approved 17th June, 1844, [4 Stat. at Large, p. 676,1
revived and continued for five years, and extended to the State
of Louisiana the expired act of 26th May, 1824, entitled "An
act enabling the claimants to lands within the limits of the State

of Missouri and Territory of Arkansas to institute proceedings to
try the validity of their claims." 4 Stat. at Large, p. 52.
Under this act, Michael Moore presented his petition to the
District Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, on the 17th June, 1846, claiming sixty thousand arpents
of land situated in the District of the Atchafalaya, in the sharp
end of land or angle where the Atchafalaya and Mississippi
Rivers join, or the point formed between the said rivers at the
place the Atchafalaya leaves the Mississippi.
The title presented by the petitioner was the following:

No. 2.-Sale of Royal Lands; page 31.
iDon Juan Ventura Morales and Don Gilberto Leonard, intendant and comptroller, pro tempore of the Province of Louisiana.
We have received from Don Antonio Iriarte twenty-four thousand bits (121 ets. each,) for the value of sixty thousand iuperficial arpents of land, at the rate of five cents per arpent, which
land has been sold to him for amount of the royal treasurer in
the district ,f country of Chafalaya-and the Mississippi, on the
point where the two unite; which payment is entered in folio
31 of -the journal of this treasury department, and seven hundred
and eight bits, (12-. cents each,) the amount due for the two

On the 8th of January, 1835, Don Roque Moreno, then residing in\iadrid, purchased the claim from Don Antonio Iriarte
for fifty thousand bits (123 cents each); and in order to btain
a formal transfer of the title, he presented a petition on the 17th
of February, 1835, to the Lieutenant Mayor of Madrid, requesting that the acknowledgment of Iriarte to the transfer might be
made in due form. Accordingly, Iriarte appeared before the
Lieutenant Mayor, and acknowledged the deed in the presence
of three notaries.

nesses, Charles Louis Blacke, being shown the orginal document,
said, " Cannot explain why the document A is cut, as it appears
to be; believes that it must have been done in wantonness.
States that documents in the intendancy department were never
cut in that way."1
Jose Martinez del Campo, witness for plaintiff, being recalled, states, that the discolored appearance of the paper, the
document A, in his opinion, arises from certain things, which he
states as fo lows: That the officers of quarantine in Spain, in
order to prevent the spreading of infectious diseases, immerse
documents in vinegar, and cut them in the manner of the document A in question, in order to make the vinegar penetrate more
easily. This, he thinks, has been the case with the document
A, and therefore, its discolored and cut appearance.
States, that all the documents from Spain are cut in like
manner; that he has often seen them; he has in his possession
letters cut in the same way.
The petitioner also offered evidence to prove the genuineness
of the letters from Roque Moreno, above mentioned.
The District Attorney put in a general denial, on the part of
the United States, and offered sundry original documents in evidence to show Morales's habitual mode of signing officially, and
also Leonard's mode of signature.
At' May term, 1848, the. cause came on for trial before the
District Court; the petitioner having entered a disclaimer as to
the lands claimed by Butler affd Black, confining his claim, as
to them, to a float from the United States. The following is
the decree of the District Court:
"It is hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the petitioner,
Michael Moore, is the true and lawful owner of, and has good
title against the United States, the defendants, in and to all

United States Audoge."
From this decree, the United States appealed to this court.
It was argued for the appellants by JIXr. Crittenden, Ator
ney-General, -who insisted that the claim was fraudulent Ovd
void.
1. The claim is not founded on any grant, cpncession, warrant, or order of survey; and so not within the statute which
authorized claimants to institute suits against the United
States.
It is simply a receipt for money paid into the treasury of
Spain by Iriarte, for land which he desired to purchase; the'
description of the land is the sole act of Iriarte himself, not
founded on any previous act of the officer of Spain for the
Province of Louisiana, who was authorized to make grants,
concessions, warrants, and orders of survey; nor is it sanctioned
and ratified by any subsequent act of grant, concession, warrant, or order of survey, to define the boundaries and sever the
land from the public domain. By our own laws, any person
may deposit in the treasury of the United States, for the purchase of the land he desires to make, and take the treasurer's
receipt therefor. But that receipt confers no right or interest in
the land which is described by the depositor. He must thereafter apply to the proper officers of the United States, who are
intrusted by law to make sales of the public lands and carry
them into grant. It would not do for such depbsitor to stop at
his deposit of money in the treasury, omtting all the subsequent
means required by law, in order to obtain a title to the lands
mentioned in the treasurer's receipt. If such a depositor should
hold slich a receipt for thirty or forty years, and then claim
the land mentioned in the receipt, his claim would be pronounced ridiculous and absurd.

DECEM1BER

TERM1, 1851.

215

The United States v. Moore.

The claim of Moore, founded upon the simple receipt produced, unaccompanied by any authoritative act, previously or
subsequently had and done, to signify a grant, concession, warrant, or order of survey, is ridiculous and absurd. The letter of
O'Donnell, Governor and Captain General of Cuba, introduced
by the petitioner, shows that the receipt is not of itself a grant,
concession, warrant, or order of survey.
0. The petition contains no excuse whatever; no reason for
the delay, for the laches and neglect, for the length of time
during which Tiarte and those claiming as assignees under him
have slept upon this receipt, without claim, enjoyment, or effort
to enjoy the land claimed under it.
The petition, by the express command of the statute under
which it was filed, is to be governed and conducted according to
the rules of a court of equity. And, as the bill alleges no excuse for the great laches, inactivity, and neglect, it is bad upon
general demurrer. Bowman & others v. Wathen & others, December term, 1843, 1 Howard, 193; Maxwell v. Kennedy's Heirs,
December term, 1840, 8 Howard, 221, 222. Inthese two cases
various decisions upon the subject are cited.
From 11th September, 1797, to the Iiling of this petition, on 17th
June, 1846, (a period of forty-eight years and more,) this claim
slept, without any attempt to obtain a survey, without any possession, without any claim known. or heard of in Louisiana. It
was first stirred in Madrid, in the year 1835, by Moreno; sent
to Havana, and passed from hand to hand there, until Michael
Moore became assignee, without date, and asserted the claim in
the year 1846.
That this receipt was suffered to sleep for such a great length
of time, without one single effort to obtain the land, lays the
foundation for the legal presumption that it has been in some
way compensated and cancelled. Its discolored, cancelled, cut,
and carved condition is but ill accounted for by the witness
Campo, who seems not to understand the meaning of quarantine. This document, A, was in Madrid, and upon the petition
of Moreno, was there assigned and acknowledged by Iriarte;
certified there; thence inclosed in a letter by Moreno to Fernandez & Co., at Havana, and never returned to Spain. That
documents sent from Spain should, by "the officers in quarantine i Spain," be immersed in vinegar, and cut to make the
vinegar penetrate more easily, "in order to prevent the spreading
of ini'ctious diseases," is reversing the order and regular course
of things. Vessels arriving in Spain are subje-cted to quarantine
by the officers of quarantine in Spain. But that the officers in
Spain should hnmerse in vinegar, and cut, to imke the vinegar
penetrate more easily, this receipt to be sent from Spain, and

SUPREME

COURT.

The United States v. Moore.

that "all the documents from Spain are cut in like manner," is
a tale not credible because of the swearing of Jose Martinez del
Campo.
Iriarte was resident in Louisiana at the date of the receipt,
and for years after. If in the beginning the receipt was true,
good, and effectual, and had not, by some after transaction, become of no effect, why did Iriarte, from 1797 to 1835, sleep upon
his right, neglect to pursue his claim, and totally fail to seek the
enjoyment of that which was his own?
The legal presumption in courts of law and in courts of equity,
arising out of such laches, inactivity, and supineness for such a
great length of time, is that this receipt may have been for a
bill, order, or note never paid; or that the money had been withdrawn from the treasury; or that the half-yearly tribute of two
and a half per cent. upon the value of the land, and eighteen
per cent. for transporting it to Spain, was found too onerous by
Iriarte, and therefore he abandoned his claim to the land, refused or neglected to pay the half-yearly tribute, cancelled his
intended purchase, or refused to complete it; or that,-by some
means or other, now forgotten in the lapse of such a great number of years, this receipt was compensated, extinguished, and
abandoned.
That legal presumption "stands upon a clear principle, built
upon reason, the nature and character of man, and the result of
human experience. It resolves itself into this, that a man will
naturally enjoy what belongs to him."
" Upon the weakness and infirmity of all human tribunals,
judging of matters of antiquity, where the circumstances are incapable of raising any thing like belief, instead of belief, (which is
the foundation of the judgment upon a recent transaction,)
the legal presumption holds the place of particuldr individual
belief."
"Mankind, from the infirmity and necessity of their situation,
must, for the preservation of their property and rights, have recourse to some'general principle to take the place of indi'idual,
specific belief."
After twenty year, this presumption will hold unless repelled
by something to excuse and account for the failure for so many
years to seek to enjoy what is his own. Hillary v. Waller, 12
Vesey 265, 266.
3 This petition was not presented to .the court within the
twc years prescribed by the statute under Which it professes to
have been filed.
4. The description of the land mentioned in the receipt is
too vague and indefinite.
As these, two last points are not involved in the opinion of the

court, the arguments of the Attorney-General in support of them
are omitted.
Mr. Justice CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.
The petition states, that about the 11th September, 1797, Antonio Yriarte, a resident of the Province of Louisiana, for the
sum of 24,708 reals by him paid, purchased from the proper authorities under the government of Spain, to wit: Juan Ventura
Morales, the Intendant of the Province of Louisiana, and Gilbert Leonard, the Treasurer of said Province, sixty thousand arpens of land, &c., all of which more fully appears from the annexed
certificate, signed by the said Morales, Leonard and Carsetano
Valdes, secretary of the Intendant, acknowledging the ;eceipt of
the consideration and the sale of the land above expressed.
The first question arising on this statement of facts is, whether the paper exhibited affords any evidence that the "proper
authorities" of Spain sold the land to Yriarte, as this party can
only sue for lands claimed by virtue of any French or Spanish
grant, concession, warrant, or order of survey, "legally made."
His petition alleges that the land was purchased on the 11th
September, 1797, from Morales, the Intendant, and Leonard, the
Treasurer of the Province. The act positively requires that the
date of the sale, concession, &c., shall be set forth, and by whom
it was made, in order that it may be seen whether the officer
making the concession, or sale, had power to do so, at the time
it was done; and here, the question of power existing in the Intendant is raised by an allegation of the fact, and a denial in the
answer. Undoubtedly, Leonard had no authority to sell, or distribute by donation, any part of the public domain; but this
would be of no consequence if Morales had such power. When
the paper exhibited bears date, a controversy existed between
the Intendant Morales and the political and military Governor
of Louisiana, as to which of them appertained the power to sell
and distribute the King's domain, the Intendant claiming authority under the laws of the Indies, and the Governor relying
on a royal order of August, 1770. The following historical account will best explain how the matter stood in 1797, when (as
is alleged) this sale was made.
O'Rielly, by commission dated 16th April, 1769, was appointed Governor and Captain-General of Louisiana, with "special
power to establish in this new part of the King's dominions,
with regard to the military force, police, administration of justice and finances, such a form of government as might most
effectually secure its 'dependence and subordination, and promote the King's service and the happiness of his subjects. 2

SUPREME COURT'.
The United States v. Moore.

Unzaga, colonel of the regiment of Havana, who had come
with O'Rielly, had a commission as Governor; but was not authorized to enter upon his duties until the departure of O'Rielly,
or *the declaration of his will. On the 1st December, 1769,
O'Rielly mude the declaration, and Unzaga assumed the functions of Governor. 2 Mart. 13.
On the 18th February, 1770, O'Rielly made the regulations
relathig to the granting of land, known by his name. The 12th
article declares that all grants shall be made in the name of the
King by the Governor-General of the Province. 2 White's Recop. 230.
A royal order of the 24th August, 1770, states, that O'Rielly
had communicated the regulations made by him to his government, and these declaring that the granting of land had been
confided by His Majesty to the Governor and Comisario Ordenador, he considered it would be better in future, that the Go-vernor alone ihould be authorized by His Majesty to make those
grants. The order to the Governor then proceeds: "The King
having examined these dispositions and propositions of the said
Lieutenant-General, approves them, and also, that it should be
you and your successors in that government only, who are to
have the right to distribute the royal lands, conforming in all
points, as long as His Majesty does not otherwise dispose, to the
said instructions, the date of which is 18th February of this present year.l 2 White's Recop. 460.
The Governors who succeeded Unzaga were, Galvez, colonel
of the regiment of Louisiana, to whom Unzaga, when he was
appointed Captain-General of the Caraccas, was directed to
surrender the government provisionally, by a cedula of 10th
uly, 1776. Galvez entered on the duties of his office 1st Januaiy, 1777. 2 Mart. 39'
Miro succeeded Galvez; the government of the province being
provisionally vested in him on the departure of Galvez in 1782.
2 Mart. 68."
Carondelet was promoted from the government of San Salvador, and entered on his duties 1st January, 1792. 2 Mart. 81.
. Gayoso, the commandant at Natchez, succeeded Carondelet
in the beginning of 1797. 2 Mart. 149. His regulations for the
administration of posts and distribution of lands, are dated 9tb
September, 1797.
So far as we have seen, the exclusive authority vested in the
Governors to make grants, stood unrevoked up to this time.
But on the .departure of Rendon, who had been Intendant in
1796, the functions of Intendant devolved on Morales, who had
been contador. 2-Mart. 131. Morales, thus Intendant'ad interim, in a letter to Governor Gayoso of the 29th August, 1797,

(a few days before the latter issued his regulations,) claimed the
right to grant the lands. 2 White's IRecop. 470. Gayoso declined to yield, but "resolved to submit the question to higher
authority, and to allow no innovation until the resolution of "His
Majesty be made known." 2 White, 470, 471. Morales also
wrote a long letter to Spain on the subject.
A royal order of 22d October, 1798, addressed to Gayoso,
states the receipt of his and Morales's communications "respect
ing the right of granting and distributing royal lands in the district under your command, which right has been vested in the
political and military Governor since the order of August 24,
1770,' and proceeds thus: " The King has resolved for the sake
of the better and more exact observance of the 81st article of the
royal ordinance for LItendants of New Spain, that the' exclusive
faculty of granting and distributing lands, of every class, shall
be restored to the, Intendancy of the province, free from the interference of any other authority, in the proceedings as established by law, consequently the power hitherto residing in the
government to those effects is abolished and suppressed, being
transferred to the Intefidancy for the future." 2 White's Recop.
478.
The royal order was communicated from Spain to Morales
on the same 22d October, 1798. In the communication t6 Gayoso, and that to himself, Morales is styled Intendant ad interim.
The royal order seems to have reached Morales in February,
1799, before it did Gayoso. Some correspondence then took
place betveen them, and Morales became vested with the power
of making sales and grants. 2 White, 478-484. Ie issued
his regulations 17th July, 1799. Tb. 234.
It wmill thus be seen, that the authorities in Spain considered
the royal order of 24th August, 1770, as of force up to February,
1799. The language is too plain to admit of a doubt. The
preamble of Morales's own regulations states, that the power to
grant was vested in the military and political government, from
94th August, 1770, to 22d October, 1798.
To the same effect is the report of Pintado, dated at Havana
in 1822, respecting lands in Florida, communicated to our government. 2 White's Recop. 339. See, also, 2 Mart. 158.
At the date of the receipt to Yriarte, 11th September, 1797, the
question between Gayoso and lorales had not been settled by
the ldng. In fact, it was only a few days after he had addressed
the ffist letter to Gayoso on the subject.
In the correspondence of Morales with Gayoso and the authorities in Spain, he refers to the eighty-first article of instructions to Itendants, as giving some foundation for his claim.
The instructions were dated in December, 1787. 1 White's

Recop. 360. They will b6 found more at length in 2 White,
67, and it will be seen to apply only te twelve intendancies
thereby created and expressly named in New Spain; it did not
apply to Louisiana. This article seems not to have been sent
to Louisiana, or been known there until Morales brought the
question up in .1797. The royal order of 1798, transferring the
power to distribute the land for the future, is conclusive that the
eighty-first article had no application to Louisiana.
Some of the Governors acted also as Intendants; but that.
would not alter the power conferred. It was in their capacitles
as governors they were authorized to make grants, and not as
superintendents of the finances.
The first Intendant seems to have come to the country with
O'Reilly. His name was Francisco de Loyola. 2 Mart. 2. He
died in 160, and was succeeded by Gayarre, ag Intendant, ad

UIzaga had the office of Intendant united to that of Governor.
2 Mart. 34. Galvez, when appointed Governor, was also appointed Intendant. 2 Mart. 39. During the time he waa
engaged in the expeditions against the British possessions in
West Florida, he had no time to 'bestow on fiscal affairs, and
Martin Navarro was appointed Intendant in the beginning of
1781. 2 Mart. 54. He left-the province for Spain in 1788, and
the two offices were again united in the person of Miro. 2 Mart.

been the Secretary of the Spanish Legation in the United States,
was appointc-d, and arrived at New Orleans in the beginning of
1794. 2 Mart. 122. Reneon was afterwards sent to Zacatecas,
and Morales was appointed ad interim, 1796. 2 Mart. 131.
Thus it appears that Morales, in his. letter of August 29th,
1797, to Governor Gayosa de Lemos, claimed the right to sell,
distribute, and grant the public lands; and insisted that the Governor should not oppose the intendancy in the free and open
jurisdiction appertaining to it, and with which no one had a
right to intermeddle. And, on the next day, (30th August,
1797) the governor replied that, as discussion of the question
would embarrass the King's service, and as the Intendant claimed
cognizance of causes respecting sales, agreements, and distributions of royal lands, he resolved to submit the question to higher
authority, "and to allow no innovation until the resolution of
his majesty be made known."
The Governor having partly shrunk from the contest, it is
highly probable that the Intendant did assume to make the sale
set forth by the receipt, which bears date twelve days after the

Governor's letter. As no authority existed in the Ihtendant to
deal with the King's domain from 1769, when Spain first got
possession of Louisiana, up to the date of the King's order made
in October, 1798, it is manifest that Morales had no power to
sell in September, 1797; and there is no evidence that the King
sanctioned this sale, nor can it be inferred from any thing appearing in the case. We think the contrary is apparent.
In 1797, Yriarte resided at New Orleans, and continued in
this country for ten years or more, as Blache states, and then
removed to old Spain. He resided at Madrid, when he transferred the receipt to Moreno in 1835. 'Yriarte never took possession of the land claimed, nor did he take any further step to
secure the property.
By the regulations of O'Rielly, made in 1770, and sanctioned
by the King, Yriarte was compelled, if he was owner, to make
mounds or levees in front of his land on the banks of the Mississippi, and also to clear and ditch the whole front of the depth
of two arpens within three years from the date of his purchase;
and, in default of fulfilling these conditions, the land was to revert to the King's domain and be granted anew. Neither could
he sell until after three years' possession, and until the abovementioned conditions were entirely fulfilled; and, says the third
regulation, "To guard against every evasion in this respect, the
sales of said lands cannot be made without a written permission
from the Governor-General, who will not grant it, until, on strict
inquiry, it shall be found that the conditions above explained
have been duly executed." That is to iay, no sale could be made
or formal title issued, until these conditions were cornp]ied with.
The land claimed fronted on the Mississippi River for twenty
miles and more, and on the great western outlet, the Atchafalaya, to an equal extent; and, if no mounds were made, the
country below must have been overflowed every year to a ruinous extent. Levees were indispensable; their construction was
a high public policy, and forfeiture an inevitable necessity, in
case of failure. These were laws and ordinances of the government under which the claim origiated, and which the act of
1824 instructs us to ohserve; the Spanish government was not
bound to complete the title; but, on the contrary, under a necessity to declare it forfeited. This is plainly manifest. Even
admitting that Morales, as Intendant, had full power to make
the sale, still forfeiture was inevitable. lnder these circumstances it is idle to assume that Morales's act of sale received
any sanction from the King of Spain, or from any one exercising
his authority.
Embarrassed as Yriarte was with the want of power in Morales to sell, and the stringency, of O'Reilly's regulations com19'

pelling him to occupy, clear, ditch, and levy, a necessity was
imposed on him to surrender his purchase and have his money
refunded; and there are several reasons apparent why we think
he did so. In the first place, he labored under no disability or
impediment; he remained quiet, never took possession, nor asked
for a survey up to the change of flags in 2804; nor did he ask
for a confirmation of Morales's void act from the Spanish authorities. And, after the United States assumed jurisdiction, boards
of commissioners almost constantly existed before which his
claim could have been presented, and through them, reported to
Congress for political action thereon; yet no step was taken,
and the claim.slept in the hands of Yriarte until 1835, when he
sold it in Madrid; and it first made its appearance in this country, when presented to the District Court, in June, 1846. When
there adduced in evidence, the receipt was cut in gashes and
stained, having the appearance of a neglected, valueless, and
cancelled paper. To account for its appearance, one Campo
deposed for plaintiff, that, in his opinion, the cut and dilapidated
condition of the document grew out of this fact: "that the officers of quarantine in Spain, in order to prevent the spreading of
infectious diseases, immersed docurhents in vinegar, and cut
them in this manner. This -was in order.to make the vinegar
penetrate more easily, and this he thinks has been the case with
the document in question, and, therefore, its discolored and cut
appeaance." He further states, "that all thp documents from
Spain are cut in like manner; that he has often seen them; he
has in his possession letters cut in the same way."
This was obviously a private receipt held by Yriarte, and carried by him to Spain; and as the money he had paid in Louisiana went to the royal treasury and was transmitted to Madrid
as the receipt showis, the fair presumption is, that when the receipt
was there presented, and the money refunded, the marks of cancellation were made by cutting the paper in gashes, as no reason
can be perceived why the holder would thus deface his own
document; nor can it be imagined why a mere sheet o; paper
should be thus cut to let in an acid, if such praotice prevailed,
which we suppose, however, to have no foundation in fact, as
witnesses in abundance could have been produced to support
this improbab. account, if it were true that all documents,
coming from Spain, are cut in like manner and stained with
vinegar.
We are called on to decide in this case according to the rules
governing a court of equity, and are bound to give due weight
to lapse of time.
The party was under no disability, and slept on his rights, as
he now claims them, for nearly fifty years, without taking a

single step. He makes no excuse for his long delay, and cannot now get relief by having his title completed.
No case has come within our experience, where the obscurity
and antiquity of the transaction more forcibly than in the present case, required a court of equity to bar a complainant,- on"
legal presumptions founded on lapse of time; and where the bar
should take the place of individual belief.
The government had taken possession, and had sold out these
lands to a great extent, and was bound in good faith to protect
its vendees; that these private o irners could have relied on the
lapse of time, and defeated the claim set up, is clear; and on
principle, their vendor could do so likewise.
Even had this claim been adjudged valid by this court, still
the decree below is in part erroneous. The part referred to is
as follows: "It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that,
in case said lands so claimed by said petitioner, or any part
or portion thereof, shall have been sold by the United States, or
otherwise disposed of, said petitioner, Michael Moore, shall be,
and is hereby, authorized, to enter in any land-office in the State
of Louisiana, in parcels conformable to sectional divisions and
subdivisions, a like quantity of public lands, after the samb shall
have been offered at public sale."
By the act of 1824, it is provided that if it shall so happen
that the lands decreed to any complainant "shall have been sold
by the United States, or otherwise disposed of, it shall be lawful for the party interested to enter the like quantity on other
lands." Here the decree is general against the United States,
and awards to complainant floating warrants for all lands that
the United States may have sold, or otherwise disposed of
within the bounds of the tract decreed. The act requires the
names of all persons claiming the land sued for, or any part of
it, to be set forth in the petition, and that they shall be made
defendants in due form by citation; and if the entire tract is
claimed by private persons, then they shall be sole defendants;
but if the government is owner in part, or of the whole, then
ths fact shall be stated, and the attorney of the district must be
served with process, and be allowed to answer for the United
States. The purpose of Congress was first, to authorize a suit
against the United States; and, in the next place, to give judicial cognizance of a description of incipient claims having no
standing in a court of justice before the act was passed; and,
thirdly, that the petitioner should be bound to sue private persons, claiming the same land, so that those having an interest,
and better knowledge of facts, and more capacity to defend,
than the United States, might be drawn into the contest; and
that they should be compelled to produce their title, so that if a

decree was made for complainant, the court could ascertain
what part of the land should be granted to him by patent; and
as this could only be done by a specific ascertainment of interfering claims, the decree must of necessity specify their boundaries and quantities. Nor can it stop here; it must adjudge that
a warrant shall issue, and be subject to location. This decree
is not only in general terms, but it is contingent, that in case all
-the lands claimed, or any part or portion of them, have been
sold or otherwise disposed of by the United States, then the
petitioner shall be authorized to enter a like quantity, &c.
The District Court, as we apprehend, did not proceed to adjudge other lands as an equivalent, on the act of 1824, as it
originally stood, but on amendatory and repealing clauses found
in the 8th section of the act of May 22d, 182S, extending the law to
Florida; and especially to the 2d section of the act of 24th May,
1828, giving further time to claimants in Missouri and Arkansas
to institute suitÂ§; both of which clauses declare that so much of
the act of 1824 as requires petitioners to make adverse claimants
parties to the suit shall be, and are thereby repealed. The act
of 24th May, 1828, contains various other provisions; some of
which modify, and others repeal parts of the act of 1824.
The act of June 17,1844, provides that so much of the act of
May 26, 1824, as relates to the State cf Missouri is thereby
revived and regnacted; and the same jurisdiction is given to the
District Courts of Arkansas, Loiisiana, Alabama, and Missis.
sippi, as was exercised under said act in Missouri; with the
exception of that part of the act (being sections 14 and 15) that
applied exclusively to the territory of Arkansas, which only
allowed claims of a league square, and under, to be adjudicated.
The thirteen previous sections stand incorporated in like manner as they would be, if they had been copied into the act of
1844. No language to this effect, could make it plainer; any
attempt to incorporate likewise the act of 24th May, 1828, into
that of 1844, would not only be a forced construction, but a
manifest perversion. It follows that the law as found in the
thirteen first sections of the act of 1824, furnishes all authority
the District Court had, to proceed, and to decree an equivalent;
and, that the true mode of proceeding, according to the law as
it stands, is as above stated, we suppose to be not open to controversy.
This view of the act of 1844 was very forcibly presented to us
by the Attorney-General in the case of the Lnited States v.,
Boisdore's Heirs, coming up from Mississippi, 11 How. 77, but
as we then apprehended that no similar irregularity might again
occur, no notice was taken of it in the opinion, dismissing the
cause on its merits.

WYLLYS LYMAN, GEORGE P. MARSH, JOHN PECK, AND JOHN
H. PECK, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR, v. TIE PRESIDENT, DIRECTORS, AND COMPANY OF TaE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES.
Where persons were indebted to a bank and gave their promissory notes for the
amount of the debt, the mere acceptance of the notes by the bank did not necessarily operate as a satisfaction; and whether or not there was an agreement at the
time to receive them in satisfaction, or whether the circumstances attending the
transaction warranted.'such an inference, were questions for the jury.
All the nots hbaving been paid except the last, and the action not being brought upon
the note but upon tho original consideration, the bank was not bound to bring the
prior notes into court: the presumption of law was, they had been given up by the
holder at the time of payment. If the fact was not so, the burden lay upon the defendants to show it.
So also, a part of the consideration being the purchase of real estate, the bank was not
bound to prove the execution and delivery of proper conveyances to the defendants.
Having given their note3 for the purchase-money, the court was bound to presume
that they were satisfied with the conveyances. If not, it iias their duty to show it.
Where th . bank had become insolvent and had made an assignment of its effects to
trustees for thu benefit of its creditors, the bank was allowed to sue in its own name
at the instance, and for the benefit of creditors, and the case was the same as if the
law permitted the suit to be brought, and the same had been brought, in the name
of such trustees.
Although the bank had indorsed a note amongst its other assets to its trustees, yet
under the circumstances it could maintain a suit up6n the note, because,
Where a party who is the holder of a note has transferred it for purposes of collection,
and it is not paid but is found in the possession of the original holder, he can recover,
us he i3 remitted to his original rights, notwithstanding the indorsement; and if the
note is not paid, the plaintiff mvy give it up and recover upon the original consideration.
Before the dcftndonts became indebted to the bank, the bank had made a compromise
of certain claims, which, amongst others, were the subject of the sale. by the bank
and purchase by the defendants. Two of the defendants had knowledge of the conditions of this 'compromise, and their knowledge must be considered as extending
to the other defendants. It was a question for the jury to determine what the
defendants purchased.

Tins case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Vermont.
