This case is much stronger against the grantor; for her deed
was worthless, unless she had elected to take the devise under
thd will, and having recited in her deed, that she was "widow
and -sole devisee," she is thereby estopped from denying that
she conveyed all rights held in either character, or, as betveen
her and the grantees, ever asserting that she had not elected to
take as sole devisee.
Being, therefore, of opinion, that the complainant below is
doubly estopped from setting up this claim of dower, it will be
unnecessary to consider the third point of defence urged by appellant's counsel, as to the effect of the decree of foreclosure.
The decree of the Circuit Court is therefore reversed, and
the bill dismissed with costs.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the

Southern District of Alabama, and was argued by counsel
On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and
decreed by this court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in
this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs; and
that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said
Circuit Court, with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint

Where goods are shipped and the usual bill of lading given, "promising to deliver
them in good order, the dangers of the seas excepted," and they are found to be

damaged, the onus probandi is upon the owners of the vessel, to show that the
injury was occasioned by one of the excepted causes.
But,'although the injury may have been occasioned by one of the excepted causes,
y t still the owners of the vessel are responsible if the injury might have been
avoided, by the exercise of reasonable skill and attention on the part of the persons employed in the conveyance of the goods. But the onus probandithen becomes
shifted upon the shipper, to show the negligence.

Wb zre spools of cotton thread, put up in boxes, were shipped at Liverpool for Charleston, and the vessel had a voyage of sixty-one days, going far south into a warm
climate, and the thread was an article peculiarly subject to the effect of dampness,

some of the inside boxes being stained, whilst tie outuide ones were not the cargo

also being well stowed and dunnaged, the injury must be attributed to the dangers
of the seas.
The usage of trade is to bring sacks of salt in the same vessel with dry goods; and
the evidence in this case is that, if the salt be well stowed, it does not increase the
humidity of the vessel, but rather acts the other way.
In this case, also, there was no evidence that the shipmaster was guilty of any negligence in omitting to provide proper precautionary measures, lie was not responsible for the effect of boisterous weather or adverse winds..
The words "contents unknown" being a~nexed to a bill of lading, imply that the
master only meant to acknowledge the shipment in good order of the cases, as to
their external condition. He might justify himself by showing that the contents
were not in good order, but the evidence in this ease shows that they were so; and
tho injury must be attributed to the dangers of the seas.

THis was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of South Carolina
It was originally a libel, filed In the District Coirt by Barnwell & Ravenel against the ship Susan W. Lind, under the
following circumstances:
On the 4th of March, 1848, Richard Shiel & Co. shipped, at
Liverpool, in the ship Susan W. Lind, Tristram Clark, master,
twenty-four boxes of cotton thread, consigned to Barnwell &
Ravenel at Charleston. The bill of lading contained the usual
clause, "to be delivered in like good order, (all and every, the
dangers and accidents of the seas anal navigation, of whatsoever nature and kind, excepted,") and was signed by Clark,
with the remark, "contents unknown."
The vessel sailed from Liverpool on the 14th of March, and
arrived at Charleston on the 13th of May.
On his arrival, the captain made a protest, showing that the
voyage had been very boisterous, and that .the vessel had often
shipped large quantities of water.
On the 15th of May, the captain requested the wardens of
the port to make the survey pf his vessel, and'they continued the
inspection during the discharging of the cargo. The following
is that part of their report which related to the goods in question:
"On the 29th and 31st, the wardens examined twenty-two
cases marked C [B R] t 71 & 92. After they were landed and
in store, found many of them stained outside with mud, dry,
and in good order; on opening the cases, the wood inside in
several of the cases appeared stained; inside of these cases
were stowed small boxes; on opening them, the cotton thread
contained therein was found musty, mouldy, and damaged;
which, in our opinion, has been caused by the great humidity,
sweat, and dampness of the hold."
Barnwell & Ravenel also had a survey made by Mood and
Smith, who reported as'follows:
"That we found the whole of the contents of the said twenty-

two cases to be in a damaged and unmerchantable condition;
and we concurred in recommending an early sale thereof at
public auction, for account of whom it may concern. And we
do further certify that, if the said cotton sewing-thread had been
landed in a sound and merchantable state, the same would be
worth in this market, at the present time, for cash, forty-five
dollars per box, containing one hundred dozen spools, say 22

The goods were sold .at auction, and produced only the net
sum of $3i335.09; but the duties being abated by $376.02, the
los§ was claimed to amount to $2,228.89.
On the 31st of May, 1848, Barnwell & Ravenel filed their
libel in the District Court of the United States against the ship,
her tackle, apparel, and furniture, and against Clark and all persons who siould intervene.
On the 3th of June, 1848, Clark filed a claim for himself,
Royal Williams, Ebenezer McLellan, Thomas MeLellan, and
James R. S. Williams, all of Portland, in Maine; and afterwards an answer was filed, denying all the allegations of the libel.
,A considerable amount of evidence was heard, tending to
show the value of the articles shipped, the state in which they
were landed, the amount of damage sustained and the causes to
which it could be attributed.
On the 24th of June, 1848, the district judge dismissed the
libel on the ground of there not being introduced at the trial of
the cause, sufficient evidence to establish the fact of the goods
being in good order and condition at the time of their shipment.
The libellants appealed to the Circuit Court. Additional testimony was taken to show that the goods were shipped in good
condition.
On"the 8th of May, 1849, the Circuit Court reversed the decree of the District Court, "conclusive evidence having been
'given to this court which was not produced before the said Distriet Court as to the shipment of the goods at Liverpool in good
order and condition," and decreed that the respondents hould
pay to the libellants the sum of $2,228.89 with costs.
.The respondents appealed to this court. Itwas argued by lllr.
Evans for the appellants, and 2ktr. £oxe for the appellees.
The whole evidence having been brought up and the argu-

275

Clark et al. v. Barnwell et al.

ment consisting chiefly of ali examination of the facts proven,
it is obvious that only the points made by counsel can be
stated.
The counsel for the appellants contended,
1. That the injury which the thread was found to have received was not occasioned by any defect or want of seaworthiness of the vessel, or any want of care in the stowage of the cargo, or in navigating the vessel; nor by any neglect, fault, or mis.
management of the master, or crew. That salt in sacks is not
an unsuitable article to compose a part of the cargo in a general ship.
That the injury which the thread appeared to have sustained
was not occasioned by the salt which composed a portion of the
cargo; but, if sustained on board, arose from other causes, for
whish the vessel and owners are not responsible.,
2. If the injury was occasioned by the dampness of the hold
of the vessel necessarily and naturally incident to such a voyage, the vessel and owners are not responsible, it being one of
the perils of navigation within the exception of the bill of lading.
The exception is: "All and every the dangers and accidents
of the seas and of navigation, of whatever nature and kind."
All vessels are subject to dampness in the hold, and especially
vessels laden at Liverpool, which is a damp -and wet place.
" Liverpool is very damp." "1Ships, with or without cargo, are
always damp, more or less, especially in summer, on a voyage
from Liverpool to Charleston." "The heat of the ocean and
,ther causes do produce dampness," &c.
3. That the thread was insecurely and insufficiently packed
for so long and boisterous a voyage as this was. This is manifest from the frequent instances of injuries received by other
thread, similarly put up; from the practice of otber manufacturers to pack in tin cases, and from the adoption of that mode by
Coates & Co., in consequence of the repeated instances of
damages sustained on the voyage by thread packed in wooden
boxes.
4. That the proof is insufficient to show that the thread was
in good order at the time of shipment. In some of the boxes the
spools in the centre were injured, while the layers above and
around them were uninjured, which could not have happened
if the injury arose from exposure to dampness $n board ship.
The bill of lading is not conclusive that the goods were in
good order at the time of shipment. " It is obvious that the quality, and frequently also the quantity, of the goods must be unknown to the master, and the

that by the quality, the exterior and apparent quality only is
meant," &c.

1 Mood. & Rob. 106; Berkleyv. Watling, 7 Ad. & El. 29. Memorandum at foot of bill lading, -" contents unknown."
The goods in this case were delivered apparently in the same
condition as received.
-5. The respondents are not liable for the two cases stowed
near the salt, the injury to which was of the same kind and
degree and arose from the same cause, as existed in regard to the
others.
6. That the libellants are not entitled to maintain this process, having no property or interest in the goods, and not being
parties to the contract.
" The party really entitled to the relief should always be made
the libellant. The practice of instituting a suit in the name of
one person, for the benefit of another, to whom the right has
been transferred, or of making one person libellant as the representative of many others, does not obtain in the admiralty," &c.
Benedict's Admiralty, p. 210, sect. 380.
" The court looks only to rights in the thing itself; to ownership general or special, and to such claims as are direct in the
proprietary interest, such as a legal title, ajus in re; or to such
as are indirect, as alien orjus adrem." Per Story, Ship Packet,
3 Mason, 258.
" If the person to whom delivery is ordered is only an agent
of the shipper and has no property in the goods, it has been
thought that he cannot maintain an action in his own name
against the master for not delivering them; not in assumpsit,
for the contract was not made with him, but with a third person, the consignor of the goods; not in trover, because no property having passed to him, he can have no right to, complain
of their non-delivery or conversion, as an injury to himself."
Abbott on Ship. part 4, ch. 4, sects. 6, 7.

.Mr.: Coxe for the appellees.
From the abstract of the case, it appears that the decision of
the District Court rested entirely upon a defect in the evidence;
and of 'the Circuit Court upon the ground that new and, additional tesAimony had been introduced to cure that defect. If so,
the case comes precisely within the language of Lord Chancellor
Truro, in the recent case of Stuart v. Lloyd, 15 Jurist, 411; 4
Eng. Lawy and Eq. Rep. 3: cWere I called upon in this case
to review the judgment of the Lord Chancellor upon matters of
fact, I should require a very strong oasc to be made out to induce

DECEMBER TERI,

27?

Clark et al. v. Barnwell et al

me to overrule that opinion, as I think that the better course is to
rest satisfied with the opinion of one judge upon such matters."
Such a doctrine promulgated from such high authority needs no
comment.
Should the court, however, consider the question as entirely
open, or that it involves any question of law of a debatable character, then the appellees submit, 1. That the anus probandiis always on the carrier to exempt
himself. Story on Bailm. sect. 529.
The bill of lading, which, on its face, says, "shipped in good
order," is, at least so far as regards the exterior appearance, conclusive evidence of the condition of the goods. Benjamin v.
Sinclair, 1 Bailey's S. 0. Rep. 174. The fact of damage being
positively established, it devolves upon the carrier to show that
it resulted from the only exception to responsibility which the
bill of lading recognizes, "the dangers and accidents of the seas
and navigation."
It is perhaps unnecessary for us to contend that it is conclusive evidence. It will be sufficient for us to say what can
scarcely be denied, that it is primdfacie and cogent evidence of
what it asserts. It may be impugned for. fraud, but I am not
aware of any decision which avows it to be questioned upon
ouy other ground. Some dicta may be found which put it
upon the footing of a receipt for money, and permit it to be
explained, or even contradicted, but no such doctrine is established by any judicial decision of which I am. aware.
Bates v. Todd, 1 lood. & IRob. 106, is a nisi prius decision.
It is inaccurately given in Abbott, 324. In the original report it
is distinctly stated that fraud proved is a sufficient ground to
impeach a solemn deed or even a judgment. Abbott, however,
omits to notice this important feature in the case.
Berkley v. Watling, 7 Ad. & El. 29, was an action of assumpsit in a common-law court, brought by an assignee of a
bill of lading. In p. 35, Patteson J. refers to this circumstance,
and asks, Where is the contract between the shipper and the
assignee ?
The decision of that case was put on the ground that plaintiff's agent was cognizant of the true state of facts varying from
the bill of lading, and that knowledge of the agent is knowledge
of the principal.
Whatever weight is to be given to the bill of lading in this
particular, theevidence dehors is strong, if not, as the Circuit
Court considers it, conclusive upon this point.
Mr. Coxe then examined the testimony.
2. The evidence furnished by the bill of lading being, in this
case, corroborated by the positive testimony of witnesses, it can

v. Barnwell et al.

scarcely.be that any doubt can exist upon the questions of law
which grow out of the facts. The carrier can only exonerate
himself from the responsibility thus prima face established, by
showing affirmatively his exemption. He must either disprove
the evidence upon which he is charged; the character of the
goods when shipped; that they were in good condition when
delivered; or that the damage which they have suffered is attributable to the act of God, or the public enemy. Abbott on
Ship. 420, 467; Story on Bailm. sect. 509; 2 Kent's Com.
602; Forward v. Pittard, 1 T. R. 27, Even in a case where
any negligence on the part of-the carrier is negatived. Siordet
v. Hall,' 4 Bing. 607.
In the case at bar it was, on the other hand, affirmatively
shown that there was a quantity of salt shipped on board the
vessel, and that such a cargo has a tendency, to produce dampness, which is calculated to damage goods of the character of
those shipp6d by libellants. St6ry on Bailm. sect. 509. For an
injury thus resulting, the carrier is, unquestionably, responsible.
The cause of the injury is not one of those for which he can
claim exemption from responsibility.
3. The thread was insecurely and insufficiently packed, the
counsel on the other side contends, for such a long and boisterous voyage as this was.
The voyage was two months, and theLship sustained no damage. No ocean..water was found in her.
But it is said that the libellants, being consignees, have no
right to bring this suit. The bill of lading was executed by the
master of the ship, and its obligation enured to the benefit of all
those who are interested in the goods shipped. In this case the
contract is expressly to deliver these goods to the libellants by
name, and that undertaking is conditional' on the payment of
freight at Charleston, the port of deliveri' They are thus made,
in terms, parties to the contract. So far as regards the simple
fact of delivery, the contract was performed; the goods were
delivered at Charleston to the libellants. The bill of lading
further stipulates that the goods are to be delivered "in like
good order and condition." -As libellants were entitled to receive the goods, they were entitled to have them delivered in
good condition.
The shippers were merely consignees, and never had any other
interest or concern in the property. (See heir testimony.)
. The authorities cited in appellants' brief show that these shippers couldnot have broughtthis suit, they having no interest in
the property. But these authorities do not admit of the construction 'given to them. 'The language of Mr. Justice Story, as
cited from 3 Mason has not the remotest .connection with the

DECEMBER TERM, 1851.

doctrine it is invoked to support. In that case the New England
Marine Ins. Co. filed a libel on a bottomry-bond. This company was an underwriter upon the vessel, and a los§ having
ensued the ship was abandoned to the underwriter, but the
compa ny had refused to accept the abandonment; and-in deciding against its right to institute the suit, Judge Story employs
the language cited by the counsel. The correct doctrine is laid
down in Abbott, 325, 328, 330, 335. In 337 it is said the. consignee will be deemed to have the property, unless the contrary
appears. That he is the proper party to enforce the obligations
of the bill of lading, is most clearly and conclusively shown in
6 Serg. & Rawle, 429. See particularly the opinion of Tilghman C. J., and Duncan, J.
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of the
District of South Carolina in admiralty.
The libel was filed against the ship Susan W. Lind and
owners for alleged damage to cargo shipped to the libellants, as
consignees, from Liverpool to Charleston, through the neglect
and fault of the master. The goods shipped were twenty.rfour
boxes of cotton thread, which on delivery at Charleston were
damaged to the amount of some fifty pei cent. The spools of
thread were packed in small wooden boxes lined with paper, one
hundred dozen in eath box, and again inclosed in a large wooden
box, six small boxes in each large one, lined with paper between
the small boxes. When these boxes were delivered and opened,
the spools of thread in each of the small boxes were more or less
stained, and spotted by dampness and mould, though the large
and small boxes themselves were generally dry, as was also
the paper covering the thread.
The respondents in their answer allege, that, if the contents
of the boxes were in a damaged state when opened, the damage
must have existed, or originated in causes that existed, before
they were delivered on board the ship, though not indicated by
the external appearance of the boxes; or must have been produced by the effects of the dampness of the atmosphere in the
hold of the vessel to which goods, wares, and merchandise are
exposed, and, especially such as were shipped for the libellants,
in all vessels, however tight and stanch, with cargoes however
well stowed, on as long and boisterous a passage as was expe.
rienced by the Susan W. Lind; or, the same was caused by such
dampness in consequence of the neglect of the shipper in not
having packed the cotton thread in boxes calculated to exclude
the damp air which otherwise it must be subject to in the transportation across the Atlantic.

-280

SUPREME COURT.
Clark et al. V. Barnwell et al.

The vessel sailed from -Liverpool on the fourteenth day of
March, 1848, and arrived at Charleston, her port of destination,
on the fourteenth day of May following, making a long voyage
of sixty-one days, during which she encountered rough weather
and violent gales, causing her to labor heavily, and occasionally
ship water.
As we have already stated, the cotton thread, when the boxes
were delivered to the consignees and'opened,'was found damaged
on account of stains and spots, the effect apparently of dampness and mould happening in the course of the shipment.
The bill, of lading admits that the twenty-four boxes were
shipped in good order, and bound the respondents to deliver the
same in like good order, "all, and every the dangers and accidents of the seas and navigation-of whatsoever nature and kind
excepted." And the main question in the case is, whether or not
the'damage in question was oc~asionied by gne of the perils nd
accidents within this clause of the bill of lading? For, as the
masters and owners, like other common-carriers, may be answerable for the goods, although no actual blame is imputable to
them, and unless they bring the case within the exception, in
considering whether they are chargeable for a particular loss, the
quistion is, not whether the toss happened by reason of the negligence of the persons employed in the conveyance of the goods,
but whether it was occasioned by any of those causes, which,
either according to the general"rules of lawr or the particular stipulations of the parties, afford an excuse for the non-performance
of the contract. After the damage to the good, therefore, has
been established, the burden lies upon the respondents to show,
-that it was occasioned by one of the perils from which they were
exempted by the bill of lading, and, even where evidence has
been thus given bringing the particular loss or damage within
one of the dangers or accidents of the navigation, it is still competent for the shippers to show, that it might have been avoided
by the exercise of reasonable skill and attention on the part. of
the persons employed in the conveyance of the goods; for, then,
it is not deemed to be, in the sense of the law, such a loss as will
exempt' the carrier from liability, but rather a loss occasioned by
his negligence, and inattention to his duty. Hence it is, that,
although the loss occurs by a peril of the sea, yet if it might have
been avoided by skill and diligence at the time, the carrier is
liable. But in this stage and, posture of the case, the burden is
upon the plaintiff to establish the negligence, as the affirmative
lies .upon him. On this, ground in the case of Muddle v. Stride,
9 Car. & 'Payne, 380, which was an action against the proprietors of a steam vessel to recover compensation for damage to
goods sent by them as carriers, Lord Chief Justice Denman, in

DECEMBER TERM,

1851.

281

Clark et al. v. Barnwell et al.

summing up to the jury observed, "if on the whole, it be left in
doubt what the cause of the injury was, or, if it may as well be
attributable to 'perils of the sea' as to negligence, the plaintiff
cannot recover; but, if the perils of the seas require that more
care should be used in the stowing of the goods (articles of silk
and linen) on board, than was bestowed on them, that will be
negligence forwhich the owners of the vesselwill be liable. That
the jury were to see clearly, that the defendants were guilty of
negligence before they could find a verdict against them."
the
Now, applying these principles to the facts disclosed in.
record, we shall be enabled to determine whether or not the respondents in the court below-are liable for the damage that happened to the goods in question, as they settle, with gredt clearness, the rule of responsibilit, and, also, on which side the
burden of proof lies to charge or exonerate them as commoncarriers. And, on looking into these facts, it will be seen, that all
the witnesses concur in the conclusion that the damage was occasioned by the humidity of the atmosphere and dampness of the
ship's hold, producing mould and mildew upon the cotton spools,
and thereby staining and spotting the thread, impairing its
strength, and rendering it unmerchantable. The article appears
to be peculiarly subject to the effect of humidity and dampness,
as the paper with wh:ch it was covered in the small boxes was
generally dry, and unaffected, when at the same time the thread
beneath was mildewed and stained, and what is more remarkable, in many instances the upper layers of the spools were perfectly dry and sound, while those lying in the centre were
mouldy and spotted; and in other instances, the only part affected were the layers in the centre.
The vessel was a general ship, tight and stanch, well equipped,
and manned; and was laden with a mixed cargo, consisting of
cases and crates of dry goods, hardware, and about two thousand
sacks of salt. The cargo was well stowed and- dunnaged. The
sacks of salt when discharged were dry as asual, and in good
condition; and no part of the cargo, except the cases in question,
appears to haye been injured in the voyage, or the subject of any
complaint.
It was insisted on the argument, that the respondents were in
fault in taking on board their vessel the goods in question with salt
as part of the cargo; but, the evidence is full that salt in sacks
is part of a mixed cargo of nearl: all the vessels engaged in the
trple between Liverpool and Charleston. One witness, who
has been in the Liverpool trade for ten years, states, that salt is
part of the cargo of nine out of ten vessels trading from that
port to the United States. Several shipmasters who have been
engaged in this trade, state, that salt always constituted a part
Q 4:;

282

SUPREME COURT.
Clark et al. v. Barnwell at al.

of their cargo, and they never knew any damage occasioned to
the other goods. Indeed, the evidence is all one way on this
point. In consequence of damage occasionally happening to
these goods, and others of like character, in vessels of a mixed
cargo of which salt was a part, some merchants latterly gave
particular, directions to their'correspondents not to send their
goods in a ship of this description. But this only shows that
the general usage of the trade would justify the shipment with
salt as'part of the cargo, and hence the necessity of the particular instructions.
The weight of the evidence also seems to be, that the presence
of salt as part of the cargo of the ship does not produce humidity
or dampness in the atmosphere; but tends rather to diminish it
by attracting and absorbing the humidity; and that unless in
contact with the salt, or exposed to the drain from it by bad
stowage, no injury would accrue to the other goods.
Some attempt was also made upon the argument to show
that the salt was badly stowed, regard being had to the nature
and character of the goods in question; and that the damage
was properly attributed to this circumstance. But there is no
foundation for the argument upon the evidence. The salt was
not within thirty feet of the cases of dry goods, with the exception of tWo cases, which were well dunnaged with matting and
an inch board between them and the salt. The spools of
thread in these were not damaged more than in the rest of the
boxes.
Now the evidence showing very satisfactorily that the damage
to the goods was occasioned by the effect of the humidity and
dampness, which in the absence of any defect in, the ship, or
navigation of the same, or in the stowage, is one of the dangers
and accidents of the seas for which the carrier is not liable, the burden lay upon the libellants to show, that it might notwithstanding have been prevented by reasoiable skill and diligenci, of
those employed in the conveyance of the goods. For, it has been
held, if the damage has proceeded from an intrinsic principle of
decay naturally inherent in the commodity itself, whether active
in every situation, or only in the confinement and closeness of
the ship, the merchant mu~t bear the. loss as well as pay the
freight; as the master and owners are in no fault, nor does their
contract contain any Insurance or warranty against such an
event. 12 East, 381; 4 Campb. 119; 6 Taunt. 65; Abbott on
Ship. 428, (Shee's Ed.) But if-it can be show, that it might have
been avoided by thie use of proper precautionary measures, and
that the usual and customary methods for this purpose have been
neglected, they may still be held liable. And the same rule applies in the case of dataage on account cf the humidity and

DECEMBER TERM, 1851.

283

Clark et al. v. Barnwell et al.

dampness of the ship, which is,
more or less, incident to all vessels engaged in trade and navigation, especially upon the high
seas. Notwithstandjing, therefore, the proof was clear, that the
damage was occasioned by the effect of the humidity and dampness of the vessel, which is one of the dangers of navigation, it
was competent for the libellants to show, that the respondents
might have prevented it by proper skill and diligence in the discharge of their duties; but no such evidence is found in the record. For aught that appears every precaution Was taken that
is usual or customary, or known to shipmasters, to avoid, the
damage in question. And hence we are obliged to conclude
that it is to be attributed exclusively to the dampness of the atmosphere of the vessel, without negligence or fault on thp part of
the master or owners.
No doubt the unusual duration of the voyage, on account of
tempestuous weather and adverse winds, in connection with the
fact that it was one in which the ship passed from a northern
to a southern latitude, and in a season of the year when the
change from a cold to a warm climate must have been considerable, greatly increased the dampness, and also the influence of
it upon goods liable to damage from that cause.
But the carrier is not responsible for delay in the voyage 'on
account of boisterous weather or adverse winds, low tides, or the
like, as was held in the case of Boyle v. M'Laughlin, 4 Harr. &
. 291. These are dangers and accidents of the iiavigation
over which he has no control, and against which his contra-t
contains no warranty.
Another point was made on the part of the respondents below, which it mty be proper briefly to notice. It was insisted
that these goods had not been packed in good condition in the
boxes at Paisley by the manufacturer, or if otherwise, that the
damage might have happened to them in the conveyance from
that place to Liverpool, before they were shipped for Charleston.
The bill of lading contained the usual clause, that they were
shipped in good order; but there was added, at the conclusion,
"contents unknown."
It is obvious, therefore, that the acknowledgment of the master as to -ie condition of the goods when received on board,
extended only to the external condition of the cases, excluding
any implication as to the quantity or quality of the article, condition of it at the time received on board, or whether properly
packed or not in the boxes. Abbott, 339, (Shee's Ed.) p. 216,
(Story's Ed.) And if the evidence on the part of the defence
laid a -ioundation for a reasonable inference, that the damage
resulted from. an imperfection in the goods when packed in the
cases, or had occurred previously to their being shipped on board,

Teal v. Felton.

the burden was thrown upon the libellants to rebut the inference. It was accordingly assumed in this case, and evidence
produced as to the condition of the thread when packed at Paisley, and also in respect to the mode of conveyance from that
place to Liverpool, preparatory to the shipment. The explanation is as full perhaps as could be well furnished, or as is usual,
under the circumstances, and brings the case. down, we think,
to th6 question of damage occasioned by the effect of the hu.
midity and dampness of the vessel in the course of the voyage.
We have already expressed our views upon that question, the
result of which is that the decree must be reversed.
Mr. Chief-Justice TANEY and Mr. Justice WAYNE dissented.

TEAL, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V. MARY C. FELTON,
BY HER NEXT FRIEND, CHARLES T. HICKS.

The 13th and.30th sections of the act of Congress, passed in 1825, (4 Stat. at Large,
105-111,) forbid a writing or memorandum from being written on a newspaper, or
- other printed paper, pamphlet, or magazine, and transmitted by mail.
The Postmaster-General directed that if the wrappers of newspapers, pamphlets, or
.sagazines, should be found to contain any manuscript or memorandum of any
kind, either written or stamped, or marks or signs made in any way, by which information shall be asked or communicated, it should be charged with letterpottage.
The part of the order relating to marks or signs was not justified by the law.
Hence, where a postmaster refused to deliver a newspaper upon which there was an
"initial," unless the person to whom it was addressed would pay letter postage,
he was properly held liable in an action for trover. It was not a case calling for
discretion in the discharge of his duties. The law, and not the instructions of a
department, furnishes the guide to officers.
The State court had jurisdiction to try the case. State courts had jnrhdiction over
all cases of trover, and the Constitution of the United States did not abogate
their jurisdiction in such cases as 'the present.

Tins cast. was brought up from the Supreme Court of the
