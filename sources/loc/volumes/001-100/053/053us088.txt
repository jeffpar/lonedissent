THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFFS, IN ERROR, V. DANIEL I.Â°
BROMLEY.
The act of Congress passed on the 3d of March, 1845, (5 Stat. at Large, 736,) forbids
the transportation of letters, packages, or other mailable matter, except such as may
have relation to some part of the cargo or some article at the same time conveyed in
a stage or other vehicle, when 'such transportation is over a mail route.
A letter or order, although 1nsealed, directing tobacco to be sent by the returan boat
as a cbmmercial transaction, was within the urohibition of the Statute.
Under the act of Congress passed on the 31st of May, 1844, (5 Stat. at Large, 658,)
directing that final judgments in a circuit court in any civil action brought by the
United States for the enforcement of the revenue laws may be reviewed in this
court without regard to the sum or value in controversy, this court can exercise
jurisdiction. The revenue bf the Post-Office Department is a part of the rovwnue
of the government.

THis case was brought up by writ of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Nothem District of New
York.
It was an action of debt on statute, commenced in the District Court of Northern New York, founded on the tenth section
of the act of 3d March, 1845: " An act to reduce the rates of
postage; to limit the use, and correct the abuse, of the franking
privilege; and for the prevention of frauds on the revenue of
the Post-Office Department."
The section is as follows: "That it shall not be lawful for any
stage-coach, railroad car, steamboat, packet-boat, or other vehicle
or vessel, nor any of the owners, managerq, servants, or crews of
either, which regularly performs trips at stated periods on a postroute, or between two or more cities, towns, or other places, from
one to the other of which the United States mail is regularly
conveyed under the authority of the Post-Office Department, to
transport or convey, otherwise than in the mail, any letter or
letters, packet or packages of letters, or other mailable matter
whatsoever, except such as may have relation to some part of
the cargo of such steamboat, packet-boat, or other vessel, or to
some article at the same time conveyed by the same stage-coach,
railroad car, or other vehicle; and excepting also newspapers,
pamphlets, magazines, and periodicals; and for every such
offence, the owner or owners of the stage-coach, railroad car,
steamboat, packet-boat, or other vehicle or vessel, shall forfeit
and pay the sum of one hundred dollars; and the driver, captain,
conductor, or person having charge of any such stage-coach,
railroad car, steamboat, packet-boat, or other vehicle or vessel
at the time of the commission of any such offence, and who
shall not at that time be the owner thereof, in whole or in part,
shall in like manner forfeit and pay, in every such case of offence,
the sum of fifty dollars." 5 Stat, at Large, 736.

The United States v. Bromley.

What constitutes mailable matter, is defined in the fifteenth
section. Tb. 737.
The declaration contains ten counts, and in substance, they
all and each of them charge, that Bromley, the defendant, was
the captain of the packet-boat Empire, which regularly performed trips, at stated periods, between two places, from one to
the other of which places the United States mail was regularly
conveyed, under the authority of the Post-Office Department, to
wit, between Albion and Rochester; and that the said packetboat, and the said defendant so being such captain, and the
managers, servants, and crews of the said packet-boat, did,
while the said defendant was such captain thereof, and while
the said packet-boat did regularly perform trips, at stated periods, between the said places, the said United States mail being
regularly conveyed, under the authority of the Post-Office Department, from one to the other of the said places, transport and
convey, otherwise than in the mail, divers letters, packets, and
packages of letters, to wit, ten letters, ten packets, arid ten packages of letters, then and there being mailable matter, other than
newspapers, &c. ; and which said letters, packets, and packages
of letters, did not, nor did any or either of them, have relation to
any part of the cargo of the said packet-boat, from one to the
other of the said places, from one to the other of which said
places the United States mail was then and there regularly
conveyed as aforesaid, under the authority of the Post-Office
Department, contrary to the intent of the act;. whereby the defendant did then and there forfeit, and became liable to pay the
plaintiffs the sum of fifty dollars; by means whereof an action
hath accrued to the plaintiffs to demand and have of and from
the defendant the sum of fifty dollars.
.To this declaration the defendant pleaded nil debet, to which
the plaintiffs joined issue.
The cause coming on to be tried, the plaintiffs offered certain
evidence set forth in thle bill of exceptions, as follows :
Wallace Sherman, to whom it was objected on behalf of the
defendant, that he was informer in the case, but the court overruled the objection.
The said witness was therefore examined in chief by the said
United States Attorney, and testified, that he was clerkiin the
post-office at Albion, from -about the middle of August, 1846,
during all which'time the mail was regularly carried under the
authority of the Post-Office, Department, between Albion and
Rochester, New York, daily. H. I. Sickles was postmaster at
Albion; that he had seen the defendant, and knew him by sight;
that he believed he was captain of the packet-boat Empire, on the
Erie Canal, in 1845, and part of 1846; that the packet-boat Em8*

pire, during the season of navigation, performed regular trips
between Rochester and Buffalo; that Albion was on the canal
between Rochester and Buffalo; that he had seen Kelsey, the
steward of the boat; that he was steward of the boat while the
defendant was captain; that he saw a letter or letters given to
Kelsey in 1846, he thought in May; that it was while the defendant was captain, and while the boat was at Albion; Kelsey
was the steward of the boat, which was going from Buffalo to
Rochester; that he thought two letters were given to him, one
by Brainard and one by Parmlee; that he did not know as any
thing else was given to the steward; that he, the witness, was
not far off; that he did not know whether both the letters were
given to the steward at the same instant of time.
On cross-examination by the counsel for the defendant, this
witness testified that this was between 10 and 11 o'clock at
night; the boat did not' stop at Albion over fifteen minutes;
that on the occasion spoken of he and one White got on the
boat; that he had seen the defendant on the boat Empire since
that time; that he did -not abandon the brat very early in 1846;
that after the defendant quit, Kelsey run the boat as captain;
that he, the witness, was not acquainted with Brainard, who
was a tobacco peddler; Parmlee attended the bar at the Mansion
House in Albion; the papers handed to the steward were folded
in the shape and size of letters; he, the witness,'did not know
whether they were sealed orinot; Kelsey got on the boat after
he took the letters; they did not contain over one sheet of paper
each.
On a reexamination by the said United States Aftorney, the
- witness testified, that he saw the report of the case by the postmaster to the United States Attorney. It is shown to and identified by the witness, who stated the report to be dated May 7,
1846.
William" V. White'-was then called as a witness for the said
United States, and testified that he resided at Brockport,.and
was at Albion in the spring of 1846, he thought in May, and
stayed at Albion from dark until 10 or 11 o'clock the same
night; and then -went from Albion to Rochester in the packetboat Empire, of which the defendant was the captain.
That the last witness, Sherman, came down to the wharf to
see the witness off. That he, the witness, did not see any Ahing
handed to the steward, or any hand on the boat. That he
arrived at Rochester about 7 o'clock the next morning, and saw
Kelsey, the steward, have something of paper, which he handed
to a boy. That he did not see the size of the-paper, or whether
sealed or open. That he did iot see from what part of his person the steward took the paper. That the boy to 'vhom the

paper was delivered belonged to the boat; he thought there was
no more than one paper, and that he should think they were
folded. That he did not notice any writing on the papers.
That this was almost half an hour after the boat arrived at
Rochester. The said United States Attorney thereupon asked
the said witness whether the said steward, when he gave the
said papers to the boy, gave any directions to the boy in respect
to said papers. And the said counsel for the said defendant did
then and there object, and insist that the said question was improper, and that the said witness ought not to answer the same.
And the said court did thereupon then and there decide, that
the said question was incompetent, and that the same should
not be answered by the witness; to which opinion and. decision
the said United States Attorney did then and there except.
On cross-examination, the said witness testified that he was
with Sherman most of the time after nine o'clock of the evening of the transaction spoken of, until the packet-boat left
Albion. That it was between the 1st and 16th of May, 1846.
That the defendant was on the boat as captain that night.
James Brainard was then called and sworn as a witness on
behalf of the United States, and testified that in May, 1846, he
was at work peddling tobacco for Mr. Palmer; that he was at
Albion every two weeks, and thought he was there in May;
that he was there the forepart of the week, but did rot recollect
the time of the month; that he recollected offering Kelsey a
letter at Albion to carry to Mr. Palmer, his employer, at Rochester, and Kelsey would not carry it, and said he was not permitted to carry letters. That this was in front of the hotel at Albion,
at 10 or 11 o'clock at night; that he (the witness) kept the letter,
and wrote an order on his employer for some tobacco, arid gave it
to Kelsey to carry; that he wrote it oi a half sheet of paper, and
wrote it half over and tore off the residue. That he folded it
over the width of the sheet, and then once at right angles with
the first fold, and directed it on the outside to Mr. Palmer, at
Rochester. That the order to Mr. Palmer was a request to send
some tobacco to him (the wifness) at Albion, by the bodt Empire, or by the, rst boat; and the witness thinks the request was
to send it by the first b-at; and this was the substance of the
paper. That he did not give the steward any thing for carrying
the letter. That he received the tobacco the next day. He
found it at the hotel at Albion, when he came back from Berne
Centre.
On cross-examination this witness testified, That he supposed,
when he wrote, that the Empire would be the first boat out of
Rochester, after .the receipt of the order by Palmer. That he
told Palmer to send the tobacco by the first boat; that he paid
nothing for bringing the tobacco.

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Bromley.

James H. Palmer was then called and sworn, as a witness on
behalf of the United States, and testified that he was the person of that name referred to in the testimony of the last witness, and had charge of the business of the firm at Rochester,
for whom Brainard was peddling tobacco in May, 1846. That
he frequently received orders from Brainard by mail and otherwise; that the orders were all destroyed; that he never sent
tobacco to peddlers except upon orders, unless they requested it
before th6y left Rochester.
On cross-examination, he testified that he recollected sending
tobacco by the defendant's boat, in May, 1846, to Brainard.
William Parmlee was then sworn, and called as a witness on
behalf of the United States, and testified that, in May, 1846,
he attended bar for Mr. Hopkins, at Albion. That he did not
recollect handing any paper or letter to Kelsey, to be carried by
him, or for any other purpose; that he had offered letters to Kelsey to carry, and he refused to carry them; that he recollected
seeing Brainard giving a note to Kelsey, written on two thirds
of a sheet of foolscap paper, and folded in about the size of an
ordinary letter, to be carried to Rochester.
On cross-examination, the witness testified that the boat
Empire brought the tobacco from Rochester for Brainard; and
he (the witness)paid the steward (Kelsey) half a dollar for
it, which Brainard afterwards repaid him.

The said United States Attorney thereupon rested the said
cause, and the counsel for the defendant did then and there ask
-the said judge to direct the said jury that the said evidence did
not establish a cause of action against the said defendant; and
that the said defendant, upon the said evidence, was entitled to
a verdict; and the said judge did thereupon, then and there elare and decide, tht the said evidence, so as aforesaid given,
sdid not establish a cause of action against the said defendant;
and that the said paper, carried and conveyed by the steward of
the said boat, from Albion to .Rochester, as aforesaid described
by the wstnesses, was not a letter or mailable matter within the
meaning of ta act of Congress, but was a paper having a differ-

ent and distinct character of its own, and could be lawfully carried by the said steward of the packet-boat aforesaid; and did
then and there, for the reason aforesaid, direct the said jury to
find a verdict for the said defendant. To which said opinion
and decision the said United States Attorney did then and there
except; and the said jury did thereupon, in pursuance of the said
opinion and decision, without leaving the box, find a verdict for
the defendant.
The cause was afterwards removed by writ of error into the
Circuit Court, when the judgment of the District Court was
affirmed.
The United States then sued out -writ of error and brought
the case up to this court.
It was argued by 1r. Crittenden, Attorney-General, for the
United States, and by Mr. Sackett, for the defendant in error.
3r. Crittenden contended:
1. That, although the amount in controversy is under the sum
of two thousand dollars, yet this court has jurisdiction, under the
act of 31st Iay, 1844: "An act to amend the Judiciary act,
passed the 24th September, 1789," whereby it is enacted, "that
final judgments in any Circuit Court of the United States, in
any civil action, brought by the United States, for the enforcement of the revenue laws of the United States, or for the collection of the duties due, or alleged to be due, on merchandise imported therein, may be reexamined, and reversed or affirmed in
the Supreme Court of the United States, without regard to the
sum or value in controversy in such action, at the instance of
either party." 5 Staf. at Large, 658. And that the laws relating to the revenue of the Post-Office Department are revenue
laws, within the meaning of the above act. The act under which
the suit is brought is entitled "An act to reduce the rates of
postage, &c., and for the prevention of frauds on the revenue of
the Post-Office Department." 5 Stat. at Large, 736. See also
act of 3d March, 1845: "An act to change the organization of
the Post-Office Department, and to provide more effectually for
the settlement of the accounts thereof," particularly the first,
third, twelfth, and forty-fifth sections. 5 Stat. at Large, et seq.
2. That The paper conveyed by the steward of the packetboat Empire was a letter within the meaning of the statute.
See testimony of Parmlee and Brainard.
1st. The law under which the suit was brought is a revenue
law, and is to be liberally construed, so as to effect the intention
of Congress. Taylor v. rTnited States, 3 How. 197.
2d. A letter is a %ritten

another; neither external direction, nor sealing, nor envelope,
are essential to a letter.
3d. The paper in question being directed externally, was
mailable matter; that is, had every requisite to enable it to be
effectively transmitted by post.
4th. That here was an attempt to evade the statute. The
steward rejected what he describes as a letter, but conveyed a
paper with the same contents and direction. See Kelsey's testimony
Mr. &ckett contended:
1. This Court has no jurisdiction, less than $2,000 being in
controversy.
The act of 31st of May, 1844, (5 Stat. at Large, 658,) giving
to this court the right of review, on error, to a circuit court, in
all "civil actions for the enforcement of the revenue laws of the
United States," does not apply to the act under which this suit
is brought. That act is a law to carry out the power vested in
Congress in relation to post-offices and post-roads, and not a
revenue act. Art. 1, sec. 8, of the Constitution.
The system of postages, established by that act, is not a system of revenue. It is a plan of compensation for the services
of government in carrying the mails.
Revenue laws must be uniform. Sec. 8, Constitution. This
law is but a graduated scale of rates charged for labor performed. Indeed, there is no power in Congress to convert its power
"to establish post-offices and post,.roads" into a revenue power.
And though postages, however unequally levied, may incidentally produce revenue, they are not levied as revenue. Official
fees of marshals, attorneys, &c., that go into the Treasury, may
as well be claimed to arise from the taxing or revenue power.
But if this be held to be a revenue law, query, does the act
of 31st of May reach suits for penalties for its violation ? Such
suits are not suits to enforce the law, but to-punish for a breach
of it.
2. The paper carried by Kelsey was not "mailable matter."
It was not a letter, and there is no other specification of "mailable matter," except letters, by which this case is even supposed to be embraced. The parties acted sincerely, and, as
they believed, lawfully. It is said, on the other side, that the
same thing was contained in the order, that was in the destroyed
letter. There is no proof of this; but if true it is of no legal
consequence. The same word might have been sent verbally,
and it would have been as much an evasion in one case as the
other, so far as payment was concerned.
This paper was not a letter, a packet, cr package; it was an

open request, a memorandum. To compel such papers to pass
through the mails would be a most useless clog to business, and
utterly derange the customs and conveniences of society. It is
not intended by the post-office act to compel business into- the
mails, but only to prevent what naturally belongs to them
from being drawn out by private hands. 5 Stat. at Large, 737,
see. 15.
3. If the paper carried was "mailable matter," standing.
alone, it was not so in its connection with the "cargo" of the
boat. The act clearly contemplates that boats and vessels may
do their own business in.relation to their own cargo, whether on
board or to be procured. This will be seen from the language
of the act. The 10th section, in stating the exceptions, says, "except such as may have relation to some part of the cargo of
such steamboat, packet-boat, or vessel, or to some article at the
same time conveyed by the same stage-coach, railroad car, or
other vehicle."
In fact, if vessels on lakes, rivers, and canals, are not to be
permitted to carry memorandums or orders, in relation to their
cargo, either on board or to be procured, they will suffer endless
inconvenience. For instance, a boat is passing, and a shipper
Nishes "cargo" put on board a few miles ahead; the mail may
not pass in three days; he wants to send by the boat an order
to his agent to ship, under the rule contended for he cannot do
it.
4. The act is a penal one, and must be construed strictly. Its
penal character is very extraordinary. It makes the innocent
pay the penalty for the guilty. So in this case.
Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a case on error, from the Circuit Court of the Northern District of New York.
An action of debt was brought in the District Court, under
the tenth section of the act of the 3d of March, 1825, entitled
"An act to reduce the rates of postage, &c., and for the prevention of frauds on the revenue of the Post-Office Department." It prohibits, under the penalties provided, any stagecoach, railroad car, steamboat, or other vehicle or vessel, or any
of the owners, managers, servants, or crews of either, which
regularly performs trips on a post-route, on which the mail is
carried, from transporting letters, packages, or other mailable
matter, except such as may have relation to some part of the
cargo, or to some article at the same time conveyed in a stage
or other vehicle.
The declaration charged the defendant Bromley, as the captain of the packet-boat Empire, which regularly performed trips

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Bromley.

on the canal between Albion and Rochester, in the State of
New York, on which line the mail was tranisported, under the
authority of the Post-Office Department, with transporting,
otherwise than in the mail, divers letters, packets, and packages
of letters, then and there being mailable matter, other than news.papers, &c., not having relation to the cargo.
The defendant pleaded nil debet, and the plaintiffs joined
issue.
Evidence was given to show that the defendant was captain
of the boat Empire, which performed trips between the places
stated, and hat the mail was regularly conveyed on the same
route in 1845 and 1846. That Brainard, one of the witnesses,
gave a note to Kelpey, the steward of the boat, written on two
thirds of a sheet of foolscap paper, and folded the size of an
ordinary letter, with a direction upon it, to be carried to Rochester. That the letter was an order to Mr. Palmer for tobacco,
which was sent by the return boat, and for which Kelsey, the
bearer, received fifty cents.
The testimony being closed, the defendant prayed the judge
to instruct the jury that it did not establish a cause of action
against the defendant; and the judge instructed the jury that
the paper conveyed by the steward of the boat, Kelsey, from
Albion to Rochester, as sworn to by the witnesses, was not a
letter or mailable matter, within the meaning of the act of Congress; but was a paper having a different and distinct character
of its own, and could be lawfully carried by the said steward
of the packet-boat aforesaid, and did therefore direct the jury
to find for the defendant, which they did; and to which instruction the plaintiff excepted.
The cause was afterwards removed to the Circuit Court by
writ of error, and by which court the judgment of the District
Court was affirmed. This judgment of affirmance is now
before us for revision.
This writ of error was issued under the act of the 31st of
May, 1844, entitled "An act to amend the Judiciary Act passed
the 24th September, 1789, which provides that final judgments
in any Circuit Court of the United States, in any civil action
brought by the United States for the enforcement of the revenue laws of the United State6, or for the collection of the duties
due on merchandise imported therein, may be, examined, and
reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States,
without regard to thd sum or value in controversy in such action,
at the instance of- either party."
That the act which prescribes the offence charged is a revenue
law, there would seem to be no doubt. In its title, it is declared
to be an act to reduce the rates of postage, and for the "'pre-

vention of frauds on the revenue of the Post-Office Department." In its character and object it is a revenue law as it acts
upon the rates of postage and increases the revenue by prohibiting and punishing fraudulent acts which lessen it. Under the
act of 1836, the revenue of the Post-Office Department is paid
into the treasury. Revenue is the income of a State, and the
revenue of the Post-Office Department, being raised by a tax
on mailable matter conveyed in the mail, and which is disbursed in the public service, is as much a part of the income
of the government as moneys collected for duties on imports.
We think the instruction of the court was erroneous. The
letter or order, as it is called by some of the witnesses, was
folded in the form of a letter and directed as such, though it
was not sealed. A seal was not necessary to constitute it a
letter or to make it chargeable with postage. The letter was
not within the exception of the statute, as it did not relate to
the cargo or to any article on board of the boat. It was an
order for tobacco on MAr. Palmer, of Rochester, who was a dealer
in that article. Among merchants, an order to the wholesale
dealer for merchandise is a common subject of correspondence.
And it may be doubted whether any other subject can be named
on which more letters are written and forwarded in the mail.
Two thirds of the half sheet which composed the letter was
covered with writing, from which an inference may be drawn,
that something more than a mere order for goods was requested
by the writer. But an order for goods, folded and directed as a
letter, is clearly mailable matter, and a conveyance of it, as
charged, Jis
a violation of the law.
The jvdgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the cause
is remanded to that court for further proceedihgs, according to
law.
Orde,.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern District of New York, and was argued by counsel.
On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged
by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in
this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed; and that this
cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit
Court for further proceedings to be had therein, according to
law.
