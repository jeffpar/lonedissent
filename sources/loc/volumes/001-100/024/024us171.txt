perhaps, hbive justified it. But the provincial laws do not apply
to the seignory and proprietorship of Maryland. The question as
to them is entirely new, and of great difficulty. The pains taken
to show, that a recovery might have been suffered in the Court of
the Castle of Windsor, proves the force of the argument of necessity as to barring by alienation. The case of descendible freeholds, the entails of which are barred in that way, may have influence on the present case.

several arguments would be necessary.-,

The objectior to the declaration is, that it
does not contain an averment, that a demand of

payment of the maker of the note, was made at
the place where it was made payable.
It is a general rule in pleading, that where any
Rule of pleading as to necessary

der to sustain the plaintiffs' right of recovery, the
declaration must contain an averment substantially of such fact, in order to let in the proof.
But the declaration need not contain any averment which it is not necessary to prove. For
the purpose, therefore, of determining whether
the declaration in this case is substantially defective, for want of an express averment that demand of payment of the maker was made at the
office of discount and deposit of the Bank of
the United States, in the city of Washington, it
is proper to inquire whether proof of that fact
was indispensably necessary to entitle the plaintiffs to recover.

entertained by Courts in this country, that a demand on the maker of a note, or the acceptor of
a bill payable at a specific place, need not be
averred in the declaration, or proved on the trial.
That it is not a condition precedent to the plaintiffs' right of recovery. As matter of practice,
application will generally be made at the place
appointed, if it is believed that funds have been
there placed to meet the note or bill. But, if
the maker or acceptor has sustained any loss by
the omission of the holder to make such application for payment at the place appointed, it is matter of defence to be set up by plea, and proof.

This question, however, does not necessarily
arise in the case now before the Court, and we
do not mean to be understood as expressing any
decided opinion upon it, although we are strongly inclined to think, that, as against the maker

when, in the body of the note, a place of payment is designated, the endorser has a right to
presume, that the maker has provided funds at
such place to pay the note, and has a right to
require of the holder to apply for payment at
such place. And whenever a note is made payable at a bank, and the bank itself is not the

In the case of iS.aunderson and Others v. Judge,
(2 H. BI. Rep. 509.) the plaintiffs, at whose
house the note was made payable, being themselves the holders of the note, it was held to be
a sufficient demand for them to turn to their books,
and see the maker's account with them, and it
was deemed a sufficient refusal, to find that the
maker had no effects in their hands. So, in the
case of the Berkshire Bank v. Jone., (6 Mass.
Rep. 524.) decided in the Supreme Judicial
Court of Massachusetts, Chief Justice Parsons.

in delivering the opinion of the Court, said, that, 1826.

look up the maker, or to demand payment of
him at any other place. The defendant, by his
endorsement, guarantied, that on the day of payment the maker would be at the bank and pay
the note, and.if he did not pay it there, be agreed
he would be answerable for it without previous
notice of the default of the maker." The rule
here laid down has received the sanction of that
Court in subsequent cases, (12 lass. Rep. 404.
14 Mass. Rep. 556.) and is founded in good
sense and practical convenience, without in any
manner prejudicing the rights of the maker, or
the endorser of the note. The endorser, knowing that the maker has bound himself to pay the
note at a place appointed, has a right to expect
that he will provide funds at that place to take
up the note; and he will be more likely to be exonerated from his liability, by having the demand
made there, than upon the maker personally.
But, if the bank where the note is made payable
is the holder, and the maker neglects to appear
there when the note falls due, a formal demand
is impracticable by the default of the maker. All
that can in fitness be done, or ought to be required, is, that the books of the bank should be
examined, to ascertain whether 'the maker had
any funds in their hands; and, if not, there was a
default, which gave to the holder a right to look

averment that the note was presented to the

maker, that he refused to pay it, and that notice
of the n n-payment was given to the endorser.
Whether this averment is broad enough to admit
all the proof necessary to sustain the action
against the endorser, is the question which arises
upon the declaration. If, by reason that the bank
where the note was made payable was the holder,
no personal presentment or demand of the
maker, could be required, the averment, so far
as it asserts such presentment, is surplusage,
and no proof was necessary to support it. What,
then, in such case, is a presentment of the note ?
It would be an idle ceremony to require the
bank to take the note from its files, and lay it
upon the counter, or make any other public exhibition of it. All that could be required is,
that the note be there, ready to be delivered up
if payment should be offered. When the note

But when the bank itself is the holder, it would
be impracticable for it to make such inquiry in
any other manner than by ascertaining that the
note was there, and examining the books to see
if the maker had any funds in the bank. If the
note was there, it was a presentment, and if the
maker had no funds in the bank, it was a refusal
of payment, according to the legal acceptation of
these terms under such circumstances.
The evidence upon the trial was introduced
under this averment without objection, and if
that is sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover,
the Court ought not readily to yield to technical
objectiorrs, where the defendant has had the full
benefit of whatever defence he had to make.
Under this state of the case, we think, the exception taken to the declaration cannot prevail.
And, the next inquiry is, whether the evidence to

sustain the action.

bank being the holder and owner of the note, the
presumption, at least 2 rimafacie,is, that it remained in the bank, to be delivered up when paid.

the book-keeper was examined as a witness,
who swore, that on the 19th day of July, 1817,
*when the note fell due, there was no balance to
the credit of the drawer, or either of the endorsers, on the books of the bank. And the remaining question is, whether due notice of the default
of the maker was given to the defendant. The
only objection to the sufficiency of the evidence
on this point is, that the notice of non-payment
was left at the poAt office in the city of Washington, addressed to the defendant at.Alexandria,
without any evidence that' that was his place of
residence. The testimony on this point is that
of Michael Nourse, a notary public, who swore,
that on the day the note fell due, he presented it
at the atore of the defendant, and demanded
payment of his clerk, who replied, that Mr.
Young was n.A within, and hle would not pay it.
And that, on the same :day, he put in the post
office notice of non-payment; addressed to the
defendant at Alexandria. If the defendant's
place of residence was Alexandria, it is hot denied but that due and regular notice was given
him. The notary was a sworn officer, officiall#
employed to demand payment of this note, and
it is no more than reasonable to presume that he
was instructed to take all necessary steps to
charge the endorsers. This must have been the
object in view in demanding payment of the
maker. And it is fair, also, to presume, that he
made inquiry for the residence of the defendant
before he addressed a letter to him ; for it is absurd to suppose he would direct to him at that

the notary was, no doubt, acquainted. The jury
would, undoubtedly, have been warranted to infer, from this evidence, that the defendant's residence was in Alexandria. If that was not the
fact, this case is a striking example of the abuse
which may grow out of demurrers to evidence.
For, a single question to the witness would have
put at rest that point, one way or the other, if the
least intimation had been given of the objection.
b was, manifestly, taken fbr granted by all parties, that the defendant lived at Alexandria. And
if a party will, upon the trial, remain silent, and
not suggest an inquiry, *which was obviously a
mere omission on the part of the plaintiff, a jury
would be authorized to draw all inferences from
the testimony given, that would not be against
reason and probability; and the Court, upon a
demurrer to the evidence, will draw the same
conclusions that the jury might .have drawn.
We are, accordingly, of opinion, that the evidence was sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to
recover. That the judgment of the Co!irt below
must be reversed, and the cause sent back, with
directions to enter judgment for the plaintiffs,
upon the demurrer to evidence, for the amount of
the note, and interest.

cause, be reversed.

And itâ€¢ is further ORDERED U. S. Bank

and ADJUDGED, that the said cause be remanded
to the said Circuit Court, with instructions that
judgment be entered there on said demurrer, for
the plaintiffs in the cause; and, further, that the

gent verdict found for the plaintiffs, according to
the tenor ihereof, with costs, &c."
a The demurrer to evidence is an unusual and-antiquated practice, 'which this Court, and other Courts, have recently endeavoured to discourage, as inconvenient, and calculated to suppress the
truth and justice of the cause. It is allowed or denied by the
Court, where the cause is tried, in the exercise of sound discretion, under all the circumstances of the case ; and, it seems, that
the exercise of this discretion cannot be made the foundation of a
writ of error. The party demurring is bound to admit as true,
not only all the facts proved by the evidence introduced by the
other party, but, also, all the facts which that evidence legally may
conduce to prove. It follows, that it ought never to be admitted,
where the Party demurring refuses to admit the facts which the
other side attempts to prove; nor where he offers contradictory
evidence, or attempts to establish inconsistent propositions.
