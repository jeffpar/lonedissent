SUPREME COURT U. S.

"Thecase inCunanghami's
reported in I .alh. and 5 Nod.
and seetfts to be founded on the p.eculiar phraseology of
the statute ot The .21 of Vamea- 1. directing Informations
to be filed inthe coutity in which the offences were committed. That statute was expbunded to extend )nly to
oflnces, which at the time of its passage were punishaJIe by law. But the words of the act of congress plainly apply to all fines and forfeitures under any penal act,
whenever that act might pass. They are the stronger
because nt many Penal acts were at .that time in the

code,.

In expouiding this law, it deserves some considera.
tion, that if ft does not liinit actions of debt for penal.
ties, those actions might, in many cases, be biought at a'1y distance of time. This. would be utterly repugnant
to the genius of our laws. In'a c6uritry where not even
â€¢treason can*be prosecuted after a lapse of three years, it
,oild scarc'ely be supposed that an individual.would re
-main.foreveir.liable to a pecupiary forfeiture.
Trhe court is of opinion that it be certiied to the circuit court for the district of Massachusetts, that the issue in law joined in thlo case, ought to be d&c.d in fayour of Ihe defendant.

had afterwards charged 'to the defendant several sums on
account of the alleged insolvency of some of the purchasers of -the'said flour. It also appeared, that in the ac.count current, and accounts of sales, the proceeds of sale
bf the said flour were stated to be outstanding, subject to
collection, and the plaintiff-did not undertake to guarantee
the debts.' Whereupon the defendant, in order to repel
that evidence, offered to prove that the sums so charged to
the defendant were lost by the inismanageinentandmisconduct,of the paintif in having made the sbles to persons
known by him to be unworthy of credit; but the court re.fusid to peinit'such proof to be made to the jury in this
action, being of opinion that such miscondu'ct was properly to be inquired into in a suit for that purpose.
