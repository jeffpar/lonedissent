And sec6ndly, "That by the record aforesaid it'man. C.-aoPi
.
"ifestly appeareth that the said Circuit Court had not ,V
"any jurisdiction of the cause aforesaid, nor-ought to
Xo.
"have held plea thereof, or given judgment therein, but
"ought to have dismissed the same, whereas the said
"Court hath proceedecl to final judgment therein."
H rper, -for the plantif in error, .:stated the only
question tobe whether the, plaintiff had a right.to assign
for er Qr, the want of jurisdiction in that Cot'.Ato which
he had choseha to.resort.
It is true, asa general rule,'that a man cannotrevers'e"
a judgment for error in process or delay, unless- he can
shew that the error, was to his disadvantage.; but it is
also a rule, that he.may reverse a.judgment for ahi errdr
of the Court, even though .it be for'his advantage. As
if a verdict be found for the debt, •damages, and'costs ;
and the judgment be only for' the debt and damages, the
defendant may assign - for error that' the judgment was
not also for costs, although the error is for his advantage.
Here it was the duty of the Court to see that they had
jurisdiction, for.the consent of parties could'not give it.
It is. therefore an error of he Court,' and the plaintiff
has a right to tblce advantage of it. 2 Bac. Ab. Tit. Brrpr. (K. 4.)-8 Co. 59. (a-) Beecher's case.-1 Roll.
