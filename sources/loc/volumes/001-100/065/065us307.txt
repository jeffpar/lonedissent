THE UNION STEAMSHIP COMPANY OF PHILADELPHIA, CLAIMANTS
AND OWNERS OF THE STEAMSHIP PENNSYLVANIA, HER TACKLE,
&c., APPELLANTS, V. THE NEW YORK AND VIRGINIA STEAMSHIP

COMPANY.
In a collision which took place in Elizabeth riyer, in 1855, between the steamship Pennsylvania and the steamship Jamestown, the Pennsylvania was in
fault, and the collision cannot be imputed to inevitable accident.
Inevitable accident must be understood to mean a collision which occurs when
both parties have endeavored, by every means in their power, with due care
and caution and a proper display of nautical skill, to prevent the occurrence
of the accident.
If the night was very dark, it was negligence in the master of the Pennsylvania
to remain in the saloon until just before the collision occurred; and if the
night was not unusually dark, there was gross negligence in those who had
the management of the deck.
The helm of the Pennsylvania was put to starboard when it ought not to have
been, and the supposition that she was backing is shown not to have been
correct by the force with which she struck the other vessel, which had taken
every precaution to avoid the danger.

THIS was an appeal from tle "Circuit Court of the United
States for the eastern district of-Virginia, sitting in admiralty.
It was a case of collision which occurred between the steam;'hip Jamestown and the steamship Pennsylvania, the libel

being filed by the owners of the former. The collision took
place some few miles below the port of Norfolk, in Virginia,
under circumstances which are freely stated in the opinion of
the court.
The District Court decreed in favor of the libellants, and
assessed the damages at $1,893.08, with interest from 1st of
February, 1855, till paid, and the Circuit Court affirmed the
decree.
Upon an appeal to this court it was submitted on printed
argument by Mr. Kane for the appellants, and argued by Mr.
Watson for the appellecs.
Mr. Kane contended that the evidence justified the conclusion that the collision was the result of inevitable accident,
arising from the intense fog which had settled upon the Elizabeth river, which position was denied by Mr. Watson. The
arguments could not be explained without a reference to the
testimony, which was quite voluminous.
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of the
United States for the eastern district of Virginia, sitting in
admiralty. The libel was filed in the District-Court, by the
appellees, on the thirteenth day of June, 1855. It was a proceeding in ren against the steamship Pennsylvania, and was
instituted to -recover compensation for certain damage done to
the steamship Jamestown, by means of a collision which occurred between those steamers in Elizabeth river, on the night
of the seventh of January, 1855, some five or six miles below
the port of Norfolk, in the State of Virginia. At the time of
the collision, the Jamestown was on her regular weekly trip
from the port of Norfolk to Richmond, in the same State, and
the Pennsylvania was proceeding up the river to Norfolk, in
the prosecution of her regular semi-monthly trip from Philadelphia to her place of destination. Libellants allege that the
Jamestown was pursuing her usual and proper course dowin
the river, and that the collision occurred in consequence of

the improper and unskillful management of those-in charge of.
the other steamer. Process was duly served, and the respondents appeared *and answered to the suit. They.admitted the
collision, but alleged, in effect, that it occurred in consequence
of the intense darkness of the night, occasioned, by a dense
fog, without any such negligence or fault as is alleged in the
libel, and in spite of every possible precaution on the part of
those in charge of their steamer to prevent it. A decree was
entered for .the libellauts - in the District Court, which was
affirmed,. on atppeal, in the Circnit Court, and thereupon the
respondents appealed to this court. It is now conceded by
the respondents that the collision was not occasioned by any
fault" on the part of those in charge of the injured vessel, but
,it is insisted in their behalf that the colliding steamer was also
without fault, and that the collision was the result of inevitable
accident. To establish that defence, they rely entirely upon
the character of the night, as shown by the evidence, and the
circumstances attending the disaster. From the evidence, it
appears that the Jamestown left the wharf at Norfolk on the
seventh of January, 1855, about eleven or half past eleven
o'clock at. night, as alleged in the libel. 'When she started
there was.'a thick.fog in the harbor, but she met with no difficultyin passing out, and it so far cleared away in about half
ap. .hourthat those in charge of her deck, as she proceeded
down the river, could see the lights and even the hulls of vessels ahead, and the land on the eastern shore. Several witnesses also testify that the moon had'risen, and that stars were
occasionally visible, though they admit that it was still quite
foggy, and that there was a.heavy mist on the water. 'Two
competent look-outs were accordingly stationed at the usual
place in the forecastle, and, the signal-lights of the steamer
were properly displayed. Those precautions had been taken.
at the time the steamer left the wharf, but about the time she
passed the- naval hospital, the master, as he had been accustomed to do on Â§imilar occasions, left the quarter-deck, and
took a position in the rigging of the steamer, some ten feet
above the hurricane-deck. Leaving the look-outs properly
stationed in the forecastle to perform their usual duties, he

doubtless chose that more elevated situation to get -a lesg
obstructed view of distant objects, and he testifies that he
could then see a mile and a half ahead, and the evidence furnishes no good reason to doubt the truth of his statement.
Intending to take the eastern side of the channel, another
precaution also became necessary, so as not to incur the
hazard of running the steamer aground; and to guard against
any such danger, he directed the mate t6 heave the lead at
short intervals, and to report to him the soundings; and the
order was faithfully obeyed. Havingtaken these precautions,
he continued to prosecute the voyage at a moderate rate of
speed; sometimes stopping the engine when the fog shut in,
and occasionally ringing the bell and sounding the whistle;
and the steamer, pursuing her regul r course, rounded Lambert's point in perfect safety, passing so near to the buoy located there that it was seen by the master from his position in
che rigging, and particularly noticed. On arriving .there, it
*ias necessary to change the course of the steamer; and inasmuch as he had noticed the buoy, he was enabled to perform
that duty without danger of iistake. Orders were accordingly
given to the wheelsman to set the course north one-fourth
east, and to run by the compass. During all this time the
master rbmained in the rigging, and he testifies that after the
steamer rounded the point, he could see from the buoy to
Oraney Island light-ship, which, according to his estimate, is
a mile and a half. Presently, however, as the steamer advanced, he saw another light, on the larboard bow of the
steamer, and finding upon inquiry -that the wheelsman had
not seen it, he called his attention to the fact that there were
'two lights, expressing the opiniiop, at the same time, that the
one-last discovered was the light of the Pennsylvania coming
up the river. His own steamer at that time was heading
north, half east, and he directed the wheelsman to port the
,helm, so as to keep both lights, well on the larboard bow,
which had the effect gradually to sheer the ateamer still closer
to the eastern side .of the channel, She had previously been
running in about four fathoms of water, but the mate soon
-ejiorted that the'-.soundings showed only three, and. as she

Co.

advanced, he informed the master that there was but two and
a half fathoms, and cautioned him that there was danger of
running aground. At this time the master saw the .signallights and bull of the Pennsylvania, as she passed the light-,
ship, on the western side of the channel. Immediate orders
were then given to ring the bell and sound the. whistle, and
the master testifies that the signals were answered from the
approaching steamer. Shortly afterwards, the mate reported
that the soundings showed but ten feet of water, and iinmediately upon receiving that information he gave the necessary
orders to stop the machinery, add reverse the engine. Both
orders were promptly obeyed, and it was then the master first
discovered that the approaching steamer had altered her coarse,
and was heading diagonally across the channel towards the
Jamestown. They were then less than a quarter of a mile
apart, .and seeing that a collision was almost in.evitable, he in.stautly directed the alarm-bell to be rung, and the whitle of
the steamer to be sounded; and as there was nothing more
that he could do to avoid the danger, he gave warning to the
men in- the forecastle, and left the rigging, and 'eturned to
the quarter-deck. Further reference to the circumstances
preceding the collision, so far as respects the injured
steanmer, is unnecessary at this stage of the investigation.
According to the evidence, it seems that the Pennsylvania
arrived off Cape Henry- at an early hour in the evening of the
day of the collision, but in consequence-of the fog and the difficulties of the navigation she did not enter the river till after
eleven o'cloek at night. She proceeded up the river at the
rate of about' six miles an hour, and the mate, who was the
acting pilot after she -entered the river, and had charge of her
deck, admits that she ran very close to the before-mentioned
light-ship, and that her course at that time was south, half
east, and it is not possible to doubt that if she had continued
on that course a short time longer, all danger would, have been
avoided. Such, however, was not the fact, as is clearly shown
by the pilot himself, and we refer to his .testimony in preferenee to that of the master, he, .'xe the latter remained in the

SUPREME COURT.
Union Steamship Co. v.

. Y.and Va. Steamship o.

saloon until just before the collision occurred.

Among other

things, the pilot admits, that shortly after his steainer passed
the light-ship, he gave the order to starboard the helm; and
what seems even more remarkable, in cases of this description,
he acknowledges that he gave the order after he knew that
another steamer was approaching, though he denies that he
had seen her lights. His theory is, and he accordingly testifies,
that he first gave the order to stop and back; and inasmuch
as that order had been executed, and the -teamer had actually
commenced to back, that putting.the helm a-starboard bad the
same effect as porting the helm would have produced if the
steamer had been going ahead. But it is a sufficient answer
to that theory, as applied to this case, to say that the evidence
shows beyond the reach of doubt, that the steamer was still
advancing at the rate, at least, of three or four miles an hour,
so that, upon his own theory, he committed- n error, and according to his own testimony he committed it with a knowledge of the approaching danger. Three or four witnesses, including the master of the colliding steamer, testify that she
was advancing three or four miles an hour when the collision
occurred, and the damage done to the injured steamer proves
to a demonstration that her headway must have been very considerable. On the contrary, the injured steamer had nearly
stopped, and being already as close to the eastern side of the
channel as the means of navigation would allow, she was almost as powerless to prevent the collision as if she had been
lashed to the wharf from which she started. It was under
these circumstances that the two steamers came together, and
the evidence shows that the colliding steamer struck the other
on the port-bow near the forward gangway, some thirty or
forty feet abaft the tem.. As described by the witnesses, it
was a full blow at right angles, and had the effect to force the
stem of the colliding 5teamer some six feet into the hull of the
other, tearing up the deck of the'forecastle a third part of the
way across the vessel, and breaking into two pieces six or eight
of the largest timbers. Looking at-the whole circumstances
of 'the collision, it is vain for the respondents to suppose tiat

this court can hold that it was the result of inevitable accident. Where the collision occurs exclusively from natural
causes, and without any negligence or fault either on the part
of the owners of the respective vessels, or of those intrusted
with their control and management, the rule of law is, that
the "loss .Must Test where it fell, on the principle that no one
is responsible for such an accident, if it-was produced by causes
over which human agency could exercise no control. Stainback et al. v. Rae et al., 14 How., 533; 1 Pars. M. L., 187.
But that rule can have no application whatever to a case where
negligence or fault is shown t6 have been committed on either
side; for if the fault was one committed by the'libellant alone,
proof of that fact is of itself a sufficient defence; or if the respondent alone committed the fault, then the libellant is entitled to recover; and clearly, if both were in fault, then the
damages must be equally apportioned between them. Plainly,
therefore, it is only when the disaster happens from natural
causes, and without negligence or fault on either side, that the
defence set up in this case can be admitted. Inevitable accident as applied to cases of this. description, must be understood to mean "a collision which occurs whern both parties
have endeavored, by every means in their. power, with due
care and caution, and a proper display of nautical skill, to prevent the occurrence of the accident. The Locklibo, 3 W.
Rob., 318. The John Frazer, 21 How., 184. It is not inevitable accident, as was well remarked by the learned judge in
the case of the Juliet Erskine, 6 Notes of Cases, 634, where a
master proceeds carelessly on his voyage, and afterwards circumstances aise, when it is too late for him to do what is fit
and proper to be done." le must show that he acted seasonably, and that Ile "did evorything which an experienced mariner could do, adopting ordinary caution," and that the collision ensued in spite .fsuch exertions. The Rose, 7 Jur., 381.
Unless the rule were so, it would follow that the master hnight
neglect the special precautions which are often necessary in a
dark night, and when a collision had occurred in consequence
of such neglect, he might successfully defend himself upon

SUPREME COURT.

. and Va. Steamship Co.

the ground that the disaster had happened from the character
of the night, and not from any want of exertion on his part to
prevent it. The Batavier, 40 Eng. L. and Eq., p. 25. The
Europa, 2 Eng. L_ and Eq., 564. The Mel.ona, 5 Notes of
Cases, 558. Applying these principles to the prese nt case, it
is obvious that the defence set up by the respondents cannot
be sustained. They not only fail to show that the steamer
was without fault, but the testimony of those in charge of her
incontestably proves that they were guilty of negligence in
more than one particular. Both steamers were in the prosecution of their regular and stated trips, and of course those in
charge of them knew, or ought to have known, that they were
liable to meet each other on the route; and if it was so dark
that the lights of an approaching steamer could not be seen,
it was negligence in the master, ivhile his, steamer was proceeding at the rate of six miles an hour, to remain in the saloon, wholly inattentive to the-peculiar dangers incident to the
character of the night; and if it was not unusually dark, then
it is clear that there was gross negligence on the part of those
in charge of the deck. It is shown by the evidence, that the
colliding steamer had two look-outs; but it is not shown what,
if any, duty they performed in the emergency, or that any
inquiries were made of them, either when the course of the
steamer was changed near the light-ship, or when the pilot
heard the noise made by the wheels of the approaching steamer. But the great fault committed on the occasion was that
of putting the helm to starboard, instead of keeping the course
or porting it when it became known that the other stegmer
was approaching; and the excuse gi.ven for it by the pilot,
that he supposed his own steamer was backing, only adds
to the magnitude of the error, as it shows that the order
was given without knowing what its effect would be, which
could only have happened from indifference or inattention to
duty.
For these reasons, we are of the opinion that the decision of
the Circuit Court was correct, and the decree is accordingly
afirmed, with costs.
