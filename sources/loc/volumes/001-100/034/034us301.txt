JANUARY TERM 1835.

HENRY BEARD, WILLIAm A. BEARD, LEWIS HAWKINS AND
MARY HIS WIFE V. JOHN ROWAN.
Kentucky. The clauses in the will of John Campbell, under which the land
in controversy was claimed, were as follows "and if within that time, my
said half brother, Allen Campbell, shall become a citizen of the United
States, or be otherwise qualified by law to take and hold real estate within
the same, I then direct that my said trustees, or the survivor or survivors of
them, shall convey to my said half brother Allen Campbell, his heirs or
assigns, in fee simple, all the land herein before described in this devise.
But if my said half brother shall not, within the time aforesaid, become a
citizen as aforesaid, I then direct that my said trustees, or the survivor or
survivors of them, shall sell and dispose of the said land, hereby directed to
be conveyed to him, on two years credit, with interest from the date to
be paid annually, and the money and interest arising from such sale to be
transmitted to my said half brother, to whom I give and bequeath the same.
But should my said half brother become a citizen of the United States, or
be otherwise qualified to hold real estate within the same, before his death, it
is then my will and desire that he shall have the sole and absolute disposal
of all the estate herein before devised or bequeathed to him, notwithstanding he may not have obtained deeds therefor from my said trustees." The
testator died in October 1799.
Allen Campbell, a native of Ireland, came -to the state of Kentucky in December 1799; and continued to reside therein until September 1804, when
he died.
On the 18th of December 1800, the legislature of Kentucky passed alaw, reciting- that by the laws then in force aliens could not hold lands therein, and
it is considered the interest of the state that such prohibition should be done
away. It then provides that any alien, other than alien enemies, who shall
have actually resided within the commonwealth two years, shall during the
continuance of his residence therein after that period, be enabled to hold,
receive and pass any right, title or interest to any lands or other estate, in
the same manner, and under the same regulations as the citizens of the state.
It was held that the full effect and benefit of this act, and the clear intention
of the legislature requires a construction which gives to it a prospecive as
well as a retrospectire application, and under this construction, Allen
Campbell became qualified to take and hold the title to the land in question,
as if he had been a citizen of the state. The devise to Allen Campbell was
a good executory devise, depending on the contingency of his becoming a
citizen of the United States, or being otherwise qualified to hold real estate.
Tis contingency was not too remote. It must necessarily, not only from
the nature of the contingency, but by express limitation in the devise,
happen in the lifetime of the devisee, if ever; and upon the happening of
this contingency, there can be no doubt but the devisee took an estate
in fee.

SUPREME COURT.
[Beard and others v. Rowan.]

IN error to the circuit court of the United States, for the
Kentucky district.
John Campbell, a native of Ireland, who emigrated to the
state of Virginia, before the revolutionary war, and continued
to reside in Kentucky until his decease, which took place in
October 1799, was the owner of a tract of land situate above
and below the mouth of Bear Grass creek, on the Ohio, comprising the land on which, by an act of the legislature of Virginia, the city of Louisville Was laid out. Upon the erection of
a part of Virginia into a separate state, these premises become
a-part of the state of Kentucky.
At the time of the making of his last will and testament,
25th of July 1786,John Campbell, who was never married, had
a brother of the whole blood, Robert Campbell, also a citizen
of the state of Virginia, a father, a half brother, named Allen
Campbell, and a sister of the whole blood, named Sarah Beard,
who was a widow and had children. His father, half brother
and sister were natives of Ireland, and subjects of the king of
Great Britain and Ireland in 1786. The father of John Campbell died before him. By his will, which was duly proved and
recorded on the 13th of January 1800, John Campbell devised
his estate both real and personal, to James Milligan, William
Elliot, and Phillip Ross, and the survivor and survivors of them,
in trust for the uses and purposes stated in the will.
The provisions of the will of John Campbell, out of which
the controversy between the parties to this case arose, were
the following
"I do further direct that after the decease of my said father, all
the profits of my lands within five miles of the mouth of Bear
Grass, shall be annualy paid, to the guardian ot my said half
brother, Allen Campbell, dunng his minority, to be applied to
his education and maintenance, if so much be required therefor, if not, then the overplus to be laid out on interest by my
said trustees, till my said half brother shall arrive at the age of
twenty-one years or marry, but upon either of the said contingencies happening, the aforesaid profits shall then and thenceforth be paid to my said half brother, for and during the term
, and if within that time my said half brother
of five
shall become a citizen of the United States, or be otherwise
qualified by law to take and hold real estate within the same,

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Beard and others v. Rowan.)

I then direct that my said trustees, or the survivors or survivor
of them, shall convey to him, my said half brother Allen Campbell, kis heirs or assigns, in fee simple, all the lands hereinbefore
described in this devise , but if my said half brother shall not
within the time aforesaid become a citizen as aforesaid, I then
direct that my said trustees, or the survivors or survivor
of them, shall sell and dispose of the aforesaid lands hereby
directed to be conveyed to him on two years' credit, with
interest from the date, to be paid annually, and the money and
interest arising from such sale to be transmitted to my said
half brother, to whom I give and bequeath the same. It is
my further will and desire that, in case my said half brother
shall die before the expiration of the aforesaid term of five
years, after his arrival at the age of twenty-one years, the
land intended by the next preceding clause to be devised to
him, shall be sold by my said trustees on two years' credit, and
the money arising from such sale, when received, shall be
transmitted to the guardians of the children which my said
half brother may leave, to be by the said guardians lent out on
interest, and an equal division shall be made thereof amongst
them, but should my said half brother become a citizen of the
United States of America, or be otherwise qualified to hold real
estate within the same before his death, it is then my will and
desire that he shall have the sole and absolute disposal of all
the estate hereinbefore devised and bequeathed to him, notwithstanding he may not have obtained deeds therefor, from
my said trustees. It is my further will and desire that, in case
my said half brother shall die before he shall become qualified
to hold real estate as aforesaid, and without children or a child,
my said trustees shall make sale of the lands hereby directed
to be conveyed to him, as is before directed, on two years'
credit, and that the money arising by sale be appropriated to
the use of my said sister, Saral Beard, and all the children
which she hath, or may hereafter have, to be lent out on interest, as is directed in the several devises, bequests and limitations hereinbefore made to them, the interest and principal to
be transmitted, and their proportions thereof respectively to be
the same, and subject to the same rules, limitations and conditions as are directed and prescribed in the cases of the other
before mentioned devises and bequests to my said sister and her
children.

SUPREME COURT.
[Beard and others v. Rowan.]

"And whereas I conceive ittobe greatly to the interest of the
several devisees herein before mentioned, to become citizens of
America, and take possession of such parts of my estate as are
hereby intended 'or them, respectively, instead of selling the
same, and receiving the consideration thereof, I do therefore
direct that all and every such devisee shall have a right to
receive their respective proportions of whatever lands may be
undisposed of at the time of their becoming qualified to take
and hold the same, and that my said trustees, or the survivors
or survivor of them, shall make fair and equitable divisions
accordingly, and convey to them their respective proportions
as aforesaid, and should my said sister come over to America
before that part of my lands hereby intended for her and her
children shall be disposed of by my trustees, I then direct that
the same shall not be sold, but that the profits thereof shall be
annually appropriated to the use of her and her children as
aforesaid, until her children shall come of age, or marry, but
that whenever any one of them shall arrive at the age of
twenty-one, or marry, his or her proportion of such land shall
be conveyed by my said trustees, or the survivors or survivor
of them, in fee simple, provided such child shall be capable of
holding the same. I hereby direct that upon all sales, which
shall be made of any part of the property herein directed to be
sold, good landed security shall be taken for the payment of
the purchase money in specie. I do declare, that it is my will
and desire that no part of my estate, of any kind, shall go to
my brother R. C., in any manner whatever, and as unforeseen
events may happen which may make it prudent to delay
making the sales herein directed to be made, 1 do therefore
authorize my said trustees, or the survivors or survivor, to use
their or his discretion therein so as to guard against such inconvenienees and losses, as there may be danger of the estate
suffering by precipitating the sales. I also authorize them or
him to alter the times of credit upon such sales, should it be
found to the interest of,the estate so to do.
"I do hereby revoke all former and other wills by me made.
"In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and
affixed my seal, this 25th of July 1786.

to be commenced by the heirs of said Campbell, of which said
Joseph is one, for and in consideration of which the parties of
the second part hereby bind themselves to pay that part of the
expenses of said suits which will fall on said Joseph in the
prosecution thereof."
The title of the tenant, the defendant in error, was derived
under the will of John Campbell, and under the following conveyances- a deed from Sarah Beard the sister of John Campbell the testator, to Fortunatus Cosby, executed on the 7th
of July 1806, and other mesne conveyances, the last of which
was from William Lytle to the tenant and defendant, executed on the 17th of February 1822.
In January or February 1800, Allen Campbell was put into
possession of the whole landed estate of John Campbell, devised to him, and which was within five miles of the mouth
of Bear Grass, by Richard Taylor, one of the executors of John
Campbell's will. When the lands were surrendered to him,
and he was put into possession of the same, it was as the
owner and proprietor thereof, in fee, as devisee under the will
of his half brother, John Campbell. He continued to occupy
the same until his death, claiming it as his own, and occasionally selling various parts thereof. After the death of Robert
Campbell, Sarah Beard, as the heir of Allen Campbell as to

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Board and others v. IRowan.]

one moiety, and heir of Robert Campbell of another moiety,
claimed the whole estate.
On the trial in the circuit court, the demandants prayed the
court to instruct the jury, that unless they find from the evidence that the surviving trustees of colonel Campbell's will conveyed by deed the land in contest to Allen Campbell, that the
law is for the demandants.
That, unless they find from the evidence that Allen Campbell was naturalized according to the laws of the United States,
that the law is with the demandants.
That from the facts agreed, and the evidence offered, the
law is for the demandants, and they ought to find accordingly
The court refused to give the instructions as prayed, and
the defendant moved the following instructions to the jury,
which were given. That the premises in question passed
in fee to Allen Campbell, the half brother of John Campbell,
under his will, and at the death of said Allen passed, by descent,
from him to Robert Campbell and Sarah Beard, and then from
him to her, provided the jury believed from the evidence, 1st.
That said John Campbell was a citizen of the United States, and
died in October 1789, and had never been married. 2d. That
sauldAllen Campbell came to the state of Kentucky in December 1799, and continued to reside therein until September
1804, and then died intestate, and had never been married. 3d.
That said Robert Campbell was a citizen of the United States,
and half brother of the said Allen, that said Sarah Beard was
half sister of said Allen, and came to Kentucky in October
1800, and continued to reside therein until the death of said
Allen, that said Robert Campbell died in August 1805, intestate, and had never been married, and that said Sarah Beard
0
was the sister of the said Robert Campbell.
The jury found the following verdict, on whih the court
gave a judgment for the defendant. "We, the jury, find that
the tenant has more right to hold the tenement as he now
holds it in the written count mentioned, than the demandants
to have it as they now demand it.
The plaintiffs took a bill of exceptions and sued out this writ
of error.
The case was argued by Mr Peters, with whom was Mr

SUPREME COURT
[Beard and others v. Rowan.]

Loughborough, for the plaintiffs in error, and by Mr Hardin
and Mr Sergeant, for the defendant.
For the plaintiffs in error, it was contended
1. That the title to the land in controversy, passed by the
will of John Campbell, in fee, to the trustees, and the survivors
of them named in said will, and so remained until the deed of
R. Taylor, trustee to Beard, was made.
2. That at the making of the said deed, the title to so
much of the said land devised by J. Campbell, as had not been
disposed of by Allen Campbell, was in Taylor the surviving
trustee.
3. That the said deed of Taylor, trustee to Beard and others,
was in due performance of the trust created by the will, and
that the title of J. Campbell passed by it to the grantees.
4. That the circuit court erred in not giving the instructions
moved by the demandants.
5. That it erred in gtving those moved by the tenant.
For the defendant, it was contended
1. That taking the whole will of John Campbell together,
it is evident and manifest, that all his landed estate, within five
miles of Bear Grass, was intended for Allen Campbell, and to
save it from forfeiture, as be was an alien when he made his
will and codicil, he invested it in trustees.
2. That Allen Campbell became qualified, under the statutes
of Kentucky, to take and hold real estate, accepted the devise,
claimed the land in dispute, lived on it, used it, and sold part
of it.
3. The consent of the executor was not necessary to perfect
the title of Allen Campbell, and if it was, the executor did
consent.
4. As soon as Allen Campbell became qualified to take and
hold real estate in Kentucky, as he did on the 18th of December 1802, that instant he became vested with the title, in fee,
as an executory devise, without a deed.
5. If Allen Campbell took the property as an executory devise, or by a release from the trustees, then, on his death, Robert Campbell and Sarah Beard inherited each a moiety, and
when Robert Campbell died in 1805, Sarah- Beard became

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Beard and others v. Rowan.]

seised of the whole fee, and conveyed it to Fortunatus Cosby,
in 1806.
6. The title of the demandants is defective, because it is derived under a deed from Richard Taylor, who was not a trustee
under the will of John Campbell, but was an executor.
7. When the conveyance was made by Taylor, the defendant was in adverse possession of the land.
8. The demandants cannot recover in a writ of right.
Some of them have, on their own showing, no title at all and
if others have a title, it is not a joint title with some of the demandants, and other persons, if any of the demandants have
title, who also have title, are omitted in the suit, although
they are joiht tenants with the demandants in the writ, and
a joint tenant cannot recover his interest unless all his co-joint
tenants are joined in the writ.
9. In a writ of right the demandant may recover less than
what he counts for, but it is less as to quantity, and not different in the nature of his title, for if he could, then the rule that
the proof must agree with the statement, would be defeated,
which would not be the case when he recovered less in quantity this is the distinction in almost every form of action.
Mr Justice THOMPSON delivered the opinion of the Court.
This cause comes up on a writ of error from the circuit court
of the United States, for the district of Kentucky.
It is a writ of right for the recovery of a piece or tract of
land, the title to which is admitted to have been duly and legally vested in John Campbell. Both parties claim under the
will of John Campbell, as the source of title.
The demandants claim under a deed from Richard Taylor, the surviving executor of John Campbell, bearing date the
21st of April 1826, to Joseph Beard, Elizabeth Megowan, and
the heirs of William Beard. The tenant claims under a devise in the will of John Campbell, and the decision of the
case depends mainly upon the construction to be given to this
devise.
The evidence in the cause being closed, each of the parties
moved the court for instructions to the jury The demandants
prayed the court to instruct the jury, that unless they find from
the evidence, that the surviving trustee of colonel Campbell's
VOL. iX.-2 P

SUPREME COURT.
[Beard and others v. Rowan.]

will conveyed by deed the land in contest to Allen Campbell,
the law is for the demandants.
That unless they find, from the evidence, that Allen Campbell was naturalized, according to the laws of the United
States, that the law is with the demandants.
That from the facts agreed, and the evidence offered, the law
is for the demandants, and that they ought to find accordingly
These instructions the court refused to give, but, on the
prayer of the tenant, gave the following instructions.
That the premises in question passed in fee to Allen Campbell, the half brother of John Campbell, under the will, and
at the death of the said Allen, passed by descent from him to
Robert Campbell and Sarah Beard, and from him, Robert
Campbell, to her, Sarah Beard provided the jury believed, 1.
That John Campbell was a citizen of the United States, and
died in October 1799, and had never been married. 2. That
the said Allen Campbell came to the state of Kentucky in December 1799, and continued to reside therein until September
1804, and then died intestate, and had never been married.
3. That the said Robert Campbell was a citizen of the United
States, and half brother, of the said Allen, that Sarah Beard
was half sister of the said Allen, and came to Kentucky in
October 1800, and continued to reside therein until the death
of the said Allen, that the said Robert Campbell died in August 1805 intestate, and has never been married, and that
the said Sarah Beard was the sister of the said Robert Campbell.
The material facts in this case are not at all drawn in question. They are agreed upon by a stipulation contained in the
record. And we must at all events assume, for the purpose of
the present decision, that the jury have found all the facts, hypothetically put by the court in the instruction given to them,
and upon the assumption of which the court instructed the
jury, that in point of law the demandants were not entitled to
recover and whether this instruction was correct, is thequestion now before the court.
Upon the argument here, several objections have been made
to the right of the demandants to recover in this action, claiming, as they do, different titles, which cannot, as is alleged, be
set up under a joint action in this manner. This however is

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Beard and others v. Rowan.]

rather matter of form, and as the case is before us on the merits, and has been fully argued, we pass by this objection without stopping to inquire whether it was well founded or not.
The clause in the will of John Campbell, upon which the
right to the land in question depends, is as follows.
"And if within that time, my said half brother, Allen
Campbell, shall become a citizen of the United States, or be
otherwise qualified by law to take and hold real estate within
the same, I then direct that my said trustees, or the survivor
or survivors of them, shall convey to him, my said half brother,
Allen Campbell, his heirs or assigns, in fee simple, all the lands
hereinbefore described in this devise. But if my said half
brother shall not, within the time aforesaid, become a citizen
as aforesaid, I then direct that my said trustees, or the survivor
or survivors of them, shall sell and dispose of the said lands,
hereby directed to be conveyed to him, on two years credit,
with interest from the date, to be paid annually And the
money and interest arising from such sale, to be transmitted
to my said half brother, to whom I give and bequeath the
same."
The testator then provides for the disposition of these lands,
and the proceeds thereof, in case his said half brother shall die
before the expiration of the aforesaid term of five years after
his arrival at the age of twenty-one years, and then adds the
following clause." But should my said half brother become a citizen of the
United States of America, or be otherwise qualified to hold
real estate within the same, before his death, it is then my
will and desire, that he shall have the sole and absolute disposal of all the estate hereinbefore devised and bequeathed to
him, notwithstanding he may not have obtained deeds therefor from my said trustees."
It is contended on the part of the demandants, that under
this will, the legal estate of the land in question is vested in the
executors and trustees, and that Allen Campbell did not take
any legal estate under the will, and could not acquire it, except by deed from the trustees or the survivor of them. And
they contend that Richard Taylor was such survivor, and they
claim under the deed from him of the 21st of April 1826. But
if Richard Taylor had no authority to convey this land, the
demandants fail entirely to show any title whatever in the

SUPREME COURT
[Beard and others v. Rowan 3

land. His authority to convey the land, lies at the foundation of the right set up by them.
Richard Taylor is not named as one of the trustees. The
trustees named are, James Milligan, Charles Simms, William
Elliot, and Philip Ross, who are also appointed executors; and
to whom the testator devises his estate, both real and personal,
in trust for the uses and purposes provided and declared in his
will. It is true that he afterwards, in a codicil, names Richard
Taylor as one of his executors. But the estate was vested in
the other executors named, as trustees, and Taylor, in his capacity merely as executor, acquired no title to the land, or any
authority to sell it.
But it is unnecessary to rest the case upon this point, as it is
very clear that, under the will of John Campbell, his half brother, Allen Campbell, took an estate in fee simple, as an executory devise, without any deed from the trustees.
The intention of the testator in this respect cannot be mistaken. Allen Campbell was an alien, and was not, or might
not be qualified to take and hold real estate. The title was
accordingly vested in trustees, with directions to convey the
same to him, when he should become qualified by law to take
and hold the same. And if he should not, within a specified
time, become qualified to take and hold real estate, the trustees are directed to sell the land, and transmit the avails thereof to the said Allen Campbell, thus providing for all supposed contingencies with respect to the situation of the devisee, and to enable him to receive the benefit of the devise.
But that his right and title to this estate might not at all depend upon the trustees, he devises the land directly to the said
Allen Campbell, if he.should at any time before his death become a citizen of the United States, or be otherwise qualified
to hold real estate, notwithstanding, he may not have obtained
deeds therefor from his said trustees.
This was a good executory devise, depending on the contingency of his becoming a citizen of the United States or
otherwise qualified to hold real estate. This contingency was
was not too remote: It must necessarily, not only from the
nature of the contingency, but by-xpress limitation in the
devise, happen in the life time of the devisee, if ever. And
upon the happening of this contingency, there can be no

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Beard and others v. Rowan.]

doubt but the devisee took an estate in fee. The words in the
will are amply sufficient to pass an estate in fee. And the
only remaining inquiry is, whether Allen Campbell, before his
death, became qualified to take ana hold real estate, m the
state of Kentucky And this will depend upon the act of the
legislature of that state, passed on the 18th of December 1800,
which is as follows "whereas, by the laws now in force in
this commonwealth, aliens cannot hold lands therein, and
whereas it is considered the true interest of this state, that
such prohibitions be done away. Be it therefore enacted, &c.,
that any alien, other than alien enemies, who shall have actually resided within this commonwealth two years, shall,
during the continuance of his residence herein, after the said
period, be enabled to hold, receive and pass any right, title or
interest, to any lands or other estate known, within this commonwealth, in the same manner, and under the same regulations, as the citizens of this state may lawfully do." 2 Littell's
Laws 400.
The evidence in the record shows, and it is so found by the
jury, that Allen Campbell came to the state of Kentucky, in
December 1799, and continued to reside therein until September 1804, when he died intestate, never having been married.
It is argued, on the part of the demandants, that this law only
embraces aliens who shall have resided within the state two
years before the 'jassing of the act, and does not therefore
reach the case of Allen Campbell.
This is certainly too narrow an interpretation of this law,
to meet the obvious intention of the legislature, even admitting
that such is the strict grammatical construction.
The preamble in the act may be resorted to, to aid in the
construction of the enacting clause, when any ambiguity
exists. That preamble evidently shows that the intention of
the legislature was to make a general provision for removing
the disability of aliens to hold real estate, and this, founded
upon state policy, doubtless for the purpose of encouraging the
settlement of the country and this object would be in a great
measure defeated by restricting the act to aliens who shall
have resided two years in the state, before the passing of the
act. The condition upon which aliens are placed on the same
footing with citizens, with respect to the right of holding and

SUPREME COURT.
[Beard and others v. Rowan.]

disposing of land, is a two years residence within the state,
and the full effect and benefit of the act, and the clear intention of the legislature, require a construction which gives to it
a prospective as well as retrospective application. And, under
this construction, Allen Campbell became qualified to take
and hold the title to the land in question, and pass the same,
in the same manner as if he had been a citizen of the state.
No constitutional objection can be made to this act. It does
not profess to naturalize aliens. It is not necessary that they
should be made citizens, in order to hold and pass real estate,
and the condition upon which this may be done, is a matter
resting entirely with the state legislature. We are, accordingly,
unanimously of opinion, that the judgment of the circuit court
is correct, and it is accordingly affirmed.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the circuit court of the United States for the district
of Kentucky, and was argued by counsel, on consideration
whereof, it is adjudged and ordered, that the judgment of the
said circuit court in this cause be, and the same is hereby
affirmed with costs.
