SUPREME COURT.

WILLIAM CALDWELL. ISAAC CALDWELL AND SAMUEL BRENTS',
APPELLANTS V. SARAH AND GEORGE CARRINGTON'S HEIRS.

A bill was filed in the circuit court of the United States for the district of
Kentucky, claiming certain lands in Kentucky, under an agreement by
parol, by Carrington with Williams, for an exchange of lands, and in which
exchange, C., the husband and deviser of the claimant, agreed to give certain lands then owned by him in Virginia to W., and of which V took
possession, and part of which he sold, and for which W was to convey
certain military lands in Kentucky to C. The bill prayed that the heir of
W should be decreed to convey the lands; and that certain persons who
knowing of the agreement between C. and W had purchased from the heir
of V and who had obtained from the heir of W the legal title to a part of
the same lands, should be decreed to convey the same to the complainant.
The court held, that although the statute of frauds avoids parol contracts for
lands, yet the complete execution of the contract in this case by Carrington,
by conveying to Williams the land he agreed to give to Williams in exchange, prevents the operation of the statute in this case.
This was undoubtedly supposed in Virginia to be the sound construction of
the statute, when this contract was made , and as the lands then lay in Virginia, Kentucky being then a part of that state, this construction forms the
law of contract.
The evidence in the cause showed, that the persons who had purchased part
of the lands to which, by the agreement with Williams, Carrington was entitled, had notice of that agreement. they could derive no title from such
a purchase against those who held under C.
According to the constitution and laws of the United States, and the decisions
of this court, the regular proceedings and decree of a county court of Virginia, are allowed the same full faith and credit in Kentucky, that they
would receive in Virginia If such a decree would be enforced in Virginia,
or if such a decree pronounced in Kentucky would be enforced in Kentucky,
the decree of the circuit court of the United States, sitting in Kentucky,
enforcing it, was correct.

APPEAL from the circuit court of the United States for the
district of Kentucky.
In January 1821, Sarah Carrington, a citizen of Virginia,
widow and devisee of George Carrington, filed a bill in the circuit court of the district of Kentucky, stating, that at October
term 1817, of the county court of Halifax county, in the state
of Virginia, she, as the devisee, obtained a final decree on the
chancery side of said court, against a certain John R. Wil-

liams, heir at law of John Williams, deceased, that he convey

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

to her, his claims, as heir to the said John Williams, to all the
military lands to which the said John Williams had title or
claim in the state of Kentucky. The land so claimed by
the complainant, consisted of one survey of one thousand
acres of military land in the county of Adair, and near to the
town of Columbia, No. 158, of one other survey on military
warrant, of three hundred and fifty acres, situated on Beaver
creek, in the county of Barren, No. 155, of another military survey of five hundred acres, situated on Beaver creek
aforesaid, and in the county of Barren aforesaid, No. 227, of a
location for one thousand acres of land south of the Tennessee
river, and adjoining the land, or a tract, at the Iron Banks,
founded on a military warrant, No. 155, of another entry or
location of one thousand acres, on said warrant, adjoining
the lands of Girault. She states that her testator had, in
his lifetime, to wit, at May term 1803 of said county court of
Halifax, obtained a decree against the said John R. Williams,
that he should, by his guardian ad litem, John B. Scott, assign
and transfer the said surveys and locations to the said George,
the testator. That the said John B. Scott, in pursuance of
such decree, did assign said papers to the said testator, as appears by his several indorsements on said papers. That in
pursuance of the decree pronounced in her favour as devisee
aforesaid, the said John R. Williams did afterwards, to wit on
the 18th day of March 1820, by his deeds, duly acknowledged
and proven according to the law of Virginia, convey and assign
to her the several tracts of land aforesaid, as fully appears
by his deeds filed, and made a part of the bill. That the said
John R. Williams, after his arrival at mature age, prosecuted
an appeal from the decree of the county court of Halifax aforesaid, to the superior court of chancery for the Lynchburg district, where and when, upon a final decree of the latter court,
the decree of the county court aforesaid was affirmed in all its
parts. She avers that the said county court of Halifax had full
power, authority and jurisdiction, to hear and determine, and
to decree In the said cause, and to pronounce and to make all
orders, judgments and decrees, which they have so made,
touching the premises, and she further states and avers that
the sam superior court of chancery for the Lynchburg district,
had full power, authority and jurisdiction, to hear, determine

SUPREME COURT.
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs.

and to affirm the decrees, orders and judgments of the county
court of Halifax. She further states that the said judgments,
decrees and orders, as before stated, stand, remain, and are in
full force and unreversed, as will appear from a full, true
and perfect transcript of the records and proceedings filed, and
made a part of her bill. That having so obtained the decree,
and obtained the possession of the assignments of the plats and
entries aforeaid, and also the deed aforesaid, she had well
hoped to have obtained and enjoyed the lands aforesaid, but
she states that she is deprived of the benefit of her said decree
and transfers, by a fraudulent combination between the said
John R. Williams, who resides without the jurisdiction of this
court, and a certain Samuel Brents, William Caldwell and
Isaac Caldwell, citizens of the state of Kentucky, and who
are made defendants to the bill. She states that the said
defendants, with a full and perfect knowledge of her claim,
and that of her testator, on or about the 6th day of January
1818, entered into a contract to purchase, for a price very
inadequate, and no part of which have they paid, the two
thousand acres of land south of the Tennessee river, as fully
appears by certain articles signed by the said defendants and
the said John R. Williams, of that date, filed, and made a part
of the bill. That the said defendant, William Caldwell, for a
consideration wholly inadequate, a very small portion of which,
if any, hath been paid to the said Williams, about the 30th day
of August 1815, pretended to buy of said Williams the aforesaid one thousand acres, near the town of Columbia, as appears
by certain articles of agreement between them, of that date,
filed, and made a part of the bill, and that the said defendant,
Isaac, was fully apprised of the fraudulent combination to
cheat and defraud her, and aiding And advising thereunto.
She further states that the defendant, Samuel, with a full
knowledge of her claim, and with a like intent to cheat and
defraud her, about the 31st day of August 1815, entered
into a contract with said John R. Williams for a part of said
lands, as appears by certain articles between them, of that
date, filed, and made a part of the bill and that, notwithstanding that she was in possession of the original plats and
certificates of survey, with the indorsements thereon, of which
the defendants were well advised, that they have artfully

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[CaldweU and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

contrived to obtain patents in the name of the said John R.
Williams for the military surveys aforesaid, and have, as she
is informed and believes, obtained to themselves, in some way,
deeds for the whole of said surveys, and have also obtained
assignments, or transfers, of the entries south of the Tennessee, and will, on such fraudulent assignments, obtain, or
atteppt to obtain, grants from the commonwealth, unless
they are restrained by the interposition of the court. The bill
prays an injunction, enjoining and restraining the said defendants, and each of them, from taking or receiving from the said
John R. Williams any letter of attorney, deed, or writing, touching the lands now in controversy, until the matter can be fairly
tried in equity, and, also, an order enjoining and restraining the
said defendants, and each of them, from surveying, or attempting to survey, said entries south of the Tennessee river, or in anywise mterruptin"or hindering the complainant in surveying the
same, or procuring a survey therefor; and, also, that the defendants convey and release all and any title they have acquired
in virtue of any contract made with John R. Williams, or otherwise, and render up possession of the lands conveyed, and for
other and further relief.
The answer of Samuel Brents states, that the lands in the
complainants' bill mentioned, were entered in the name of John
Williams, and so far as surveys have been made and registered,
they have been in his name. He does not admit that any valid
sale of the lands has been made, such as could bind John
Williams in law or conscience. Since he has heard any thing
on the subject of a contract between said Williams and George
Carrington, he has understood it was a matter of doubt whether
a contract of any kind took place or not, and if any ever did
take place, it was after the operation of the statute of frauds
and perjuries; was merely verbal, very vague and uncertain,
and not at any time reduced to writing, and consequently not
obligatory on the said Williams, or those claiming under him.
Should any such verbal contract appear, (and he verily believes
there never was any) he pleads and relies on the said statute
to prevent frauds and perjuries, in bar and preclusion of the
said contract, and of the claim of the complainants, or any
person holding or claiming under the said contract. He is
informed, and believes that the said John Williams and the'
VOL. IX.-If

SUPREME COURT
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

said George Carrington lived many years in Virginia, in the
same neighbourhood, and had many opportunities of consummating an exchange, or sale of said lands, if any existed, but
that no suit was ever brought in the lifetime of said Williams,
and that the respondent is informed, and believes, that the said
Williams died some time about the year 1795 or 1796, and that
the suit mentioned in said bill, upon which the decree (if any
such existed) was founded, was contrived after the death of the
said Williams (although it is pretended that the said contract
was made many years before his death), when there was no
person left who was able or willing to state the true nature of
the dealings between the said Williams and the said George
Carrington. He heard of a suit depending in some county
court in Virginia, but heard and understood that it was founded
on a contract not binding in law or equity. He states that he
is informed, and believes, the said John Williams departed this
life, leaving John Robert Williams, his son and only heir at law,
and that the lands, in the bill mentioned, descended to his said
son, and that about the last of August 1815, the said John
Robert Williams called on this defendant to attend to the
securement of the titles to said lands. The respondent undertook said business, (the patents for said lands not having then
issued) and proceeded with much care, labour and expense,
and obtained patents for said lands, as far as said lands had
been surveyed. Patents to a part of said lands, have not yet
been obtained. Two thousand acres thereof, in two different
entries, had not then been surveyed, and he does not know
whether they are yet surveyed. The latter two thousand
acres lie below the Tennessee river, in this state, and in the
late purchase made of the Indians the said lands lying in the
Indian boundary, this respondent presumes is the reason why
said two thousand acres have not been surveyed, registered and
patented. The respondent, on the 31st of August 1814, entered into a written contract with the said John Robert Williams, by which the respondent was to have five hundred acres
of said lands; and that, on the 12th of November 1816, patents
issued to the said John Robert Williams for two of the tracts
in the bill mentioned, one of three hundred and fifty acres, on
Beaver Creek, and the other of five hundred acres, adjoining
the said three hundred and fifty acres, and that, in satisfaction of the contract between the said John Robert Williams

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[CaldwelI and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

and the respondent, the respondent took five hundred acres
out of the said two tracts, including the whole of the three
hundred and fifty acres, and the lower part of the said five
hundred acres, and that afterwards, to wit on the 5th of
January 1818, the respondent purchased the remainder of the
five hundred acres aforesaid, and having satisfied and completed
the payment of the consideration for said five hundred acres,
embracing the three hundred and fifty acres, and one hundred and'fifty acres of the five hundred acre tract, and having
bought of the said John Robert Williams the balance of the five
hundred acres, the respondent received a deed of conveyance
for said two tracts of three hundred and fifty and five hundred
acres, amounting to eight hundred and fifty acres. This deed
was made, signed, sealed and delivered, to the respondent, and
bears date the said 5th day ofJanuary 1818. And the respondent
now has the possession of said eight hundred and fifty acres of
land, and hopes he shall not be disturbed in the enjoyment
thereof by the pretended claim of the complainants.
At the time of receiving said conveyance, or at any time
before, the respondent had no knowledge or information of any
valid claim to said land, by any other person than the said John
R. Williams, who conveyed to the respondent. The respondent does not now recollect of hearing any thing of the claim of
the complainants before his conveyance, but had only heard
that some verbal or illegal claim was set up in some bill filed
in some county court in Virginia, and, of which verbal claim,
the respondent did not conceive himself bound to take notice.
The respondent, on the 6th of January 1818, in conjunction
with his co-defendants, William and Isaac Caldwell, purchased
two thousand acres of land lying in the Indian boundary, not
then surveyed, and not yet patented, and received an assignment of the said John R. Williams of said land, being in two
entries of one thousand acres each, one entry, No. 7, dated
2d August 1784, calling to adjoin the town, the other, No.
384, dated 10th August 1784, calling to adjoin John Giralts,
Richard Taylor and James Bradley no other title to said
lands has as yet been obtained by this respondent. The foregoing statement of facts exhibits the extent of the respondent's
interest in the said lands. He states that he knows nothing
of the fact stated in said bill, of the guardian of said John R.

SUPREME COURT
[Caldwell and others v. Carrwgtoa's Heirs.]

Williams, while said Williams was an infant, making assignments of the plats and certificates of said lands. If such was
the fact, the respondent believes it was an unlawful act, and
therefore not binding in law or equity. He knows nothing of
the conveyance alleged to have been made by the said John
R. Williams, on the 18th day of March 1820. The respondent requires its production, and proof of its legality, and that it
conveys to the complainants an interest n the lands previously
sold and previously conveyed to the respondent. The deed of
conveyance made by the said Williams to him, is of record in
the county court clerk's office, of Barren county, from whence
a copy may be had. Copies of the patents of the said three
hundred and fifty and five hundred acre tracts of land may be
obtained from the register's office. The complainants may
easily obtain such copies, or, if it be at all material, the respondent will file the originals. The respondent protests
against the jurisdiction of the court of Virginia, to operate on
the lands in Kentucky, to compel conveyances by any act done
by the guardian of said Williams, and that, if the decree is
only to operate upon the said John R. Williams, the title of the
complainants can only be considered as commencing from the
date of the alleged deed to said Sarah, of the 18th of March
1820, as this respondent was not bound to take notice of a verbal sale, or the proceedings in a foreign court not having jurisdiction of the subject matter.
The answer of William Caldwell denies that any sale of the
lands wap made by John Williams to George Carrington, which
was valid or binding, and if any was made it was not reduced
to writing, and was void by the statute of frauds; and he pleads
the same statute. The answer states a proceeding by the
widow of George Carrington, to compel John W Scott, the
guardian of John R. Williams, to convey the land. He states
some transactions with John W Scott relative to the land, and
information to have been received by a person appointed by
him to make inquiry about the land, and to make a purchase
of part of the land, and that an agreement was made for him
with Scott and Paul Carrington for the land, but afterwards,
when prepared to pay the purchase money for the same, he
found Scott and Carrington had no title to the land they contracted to sell to him. Afterwards, John R. Williams came to

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

Kentucky He consulted several of the most skilful and
learned lawyers in Kentucky, all of whom advised this defendant that the said Williams would hold the land, that the claim
of Carrington was null and void. This defendant did verily
believe that the said John R. Williams was the only lawful
owner of said land, and that the claim of Carrington was fraudulently put up to cheat an-infant, that he did accordingly
purchase the said land from the said Williams for the same
price he was to have given the said Scott and Carrington,
which was considered a full and fair consideration, and not a
small and invaluable one, as falsely set forth in complainants'
bill. He states that he has not been party to any suit in Virginia or elsewhere, between any of the complainants or their
ancestors, and the said John R. Williams, and consequently,
as he believes, should not be bound by any decree pronounced
by the courts of Virginia in any such case. He protests against
the jurisdiction of the courts of Virginia to operate on the lands
in Kentucky, and if the decrees of the courts of Virginia can
only operate on the person of the said John R. Williams, the
title of the complainants can only be considered as commencing
from the date of the alleged deed from the said John R. Wil
liams to Sarah Carrington, 18th of March 1820, as this defendant was not bound to take notice of verbal sales, or the proceedings of foreign courts who could not en'tertain jurisdiction
of the subject matter.
The answer of Isaac Caldwell admits the purchase of part
of the land as stated in the bill from John R. Williams, under
agreements for the purchase of the same. As to notice of the
title of the complainants and of their proceedings to establish
the same, the answer states as follows "this defendant states
that, previous to his purchase of said lands west of Tennessee,
he did see the record and proceedings of the Halifax county
court, in Virginia, made in the suit decided in 1803, wherein
George Carrington, (the complainant's husband) was complainant, and said John R. Williams, by his guardian, was defendant, that his object in examining said record and proceedings, originally, was to ascertain in whom the best right to said
land vested, and, at that time, this defendant was, for several
considerations, desirous that the claim set up by the complainant should prevail, but, upon exhibiting a full transcript of the

SUPREME COURT
(Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

record of said suit to three or four counsellors in this state, reputed the most learned in the law, he was advised by each of
them that John R. Williams would eventually succeed under
the land laws of the country against the claim under which the
complainant alleges title, and that the evidences of the purchase, charged by the complainant to have been made by
George Carrington of said John Williams, were not sufficient
to authorize and support a recovery against John R. Williams,
the heir at law. Under this intelligence, this defendant,
believing that he was purchasing the only right by which said
land could be held, entered into the contract aforesaid with
said John R. Williams. This defendant calls upon said complainant to produce and file complete transcripts of the several
records and proceedings of the courts in Virginia, referred to in
her bill. He denies that a knowledge of the record and proceedings, in the suit decided in 1803, would amount to notice
of a superior equity in the complainant, or her ancestor or devisor, or that such notice could be obtained from the bill,
answer and depositions, in the latter suit, which were all the
evidences upon that subject which this defendant had, at the
time of his purchase aforesaid, from said John R. Williams
for these documents, instead of presenting to the mind evidence
of an equitable claim, go to repel the very idea of its existence,
as by the complanant's own showing in the bills and depositions, the contract under which she attempts to obtain said
lands, is uncertain, illegal and void. This defendant believes
that the complainant was satisfied of the vagueness and insufficiency of the decree of 1803, as she seems, about the year
1816, to have instituted another suit, founded upon the same
contract, and to have abandoned the decree formerly pronounced.
This defendant submits to the court whether his rights
to lands Within this commonwealth are to be thus bound by
the decree of a court of another state, in a suit to which be
was not party, and which decree, upon the face of the record,
was predicated upon facts entirely insufficient to sustain it
under the laws of this state, whatever may be the laws
or rules of decisions with. the courts of such other state,
and if the court should be of opinion that this defendant is
not bound by a decree pronounced in the state of Virginia sub-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

sequent to his purchase, or, at any rate, of which he had no
knowledge till subsequent to his purchase, he then hopes that
the complainant may be put upon the proof of the purchase,
if any, as is alleged by her to have been made by her devisor
from said John Williams. He conceives that the transfer
and assignment made by said John R. Williams to said Sarah
Carrington in 1820, can have no relation to, or sanctity
attached to it, on account of the decree pronounced between
those parties in Virginia, as that decree could only operate and
be executed upon the person of said John R. Williams-the
thing which was the subject matter of the 'decree, being without the control of the chancellor, and not subject to the laws
of this state, or to be affected or operated upon by the process of
this court, and that, therefore, the assignment obtained by this
defendant and his co-partners, being prior in time, should prevail against the pretended equity of said complainant. The
defendant is persuaded that the assignment executed by said
John R. Williams to the complainant was not obtained by
process under the decree aforesaid, but that said complainant,
being aware of the inefficacy and illegality of said decree, has
confederated with said Williams for the purpose of defeating
the prior and better claim of the defendants, and for that purpose has induced said Williams to execute the assignment
dated in 1820. The respondent insists that if any sale was
ever made of the lands in question by said John Williams to
said George Carrington, that such sale was verbal, and not
evidenced by any agreement or memorandum in writing; and,
therefore, was void, under the statute to prevent fiauds and
perjuries, upon which he relies.
Witnesses were examined in support of the allegations in the
bill, whose testimony is stated in the opinion of the court. No
counter evidence was offered by the respondents.
On the 21st day of May 1832, the circuit court by a final decree ordered that the defendants do, by their joint or several
deeds, on or before the 1st day of July next, by a sufficient
deed, or by sufficient deeds, release and convey to the complainants all right and title which they have, either jointly or
severally, in the several tracts of land referred to in the bill,
and included in the deeds of John R. Williams to George
Carrington, and also his deed to Sarah, Carrington, with spe-

SUPREME COURT.
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

cial warranty against themselves and all persons claiming
under them, and, also, that they do, on or before the said day,
severally orjointly, surrender to the complainants, their agent
or attorney, possession of said tracts of land, and to enable the
complainants to take the possession, the court do direct and
order that the clerk do, on the request of the complainants, at
any time after the said 1st day of July, issue to them a writ or
writs of habere facias possessionem, directed to the marshal of
the district, whose duty it shall be to execute the same.
The defendants prosecuted this appeal.
The case was argued by Mr Bibb and Mr Hardin, with
whom was Mr Loughborough, for the appellants, and by Mr
Jones, with whom was Mr Coxe, for the appellees.
For the appellants it was insisted
1. That the verbhl contract of 1787 or 1788, alleged, was
against the statute of frauds, and not such as courts of equity
ought to enforce specifically.
2. That the proceedings and decree of Halifax, in 1803, did
not constitute an equity, that those proceedings were inoperative and void.
3. That notice, in 1815, of those proceedings, did not convert them into an equity, but was notice of an illegal, insufficient claim, dead in fact and in law, proscribed by the statute
of frauds, and extinguished by lapse of time.
4. That the proceedings and decree of 1817, and subsequently, in the courts of Virginia, did not bind the appellants,
citizens of Kentucky, because they were not parties.
5. That notice of those proceedings, had in May and November 1818, cannot overreach the equities acquired by the
appellants before such notice, nor make them parties to those
proceqdings and decrees.
6. That the appellees have not made out any equity prior
or superior to the equities of the appellants, that the deeds of
1820, executed by John R. Williams by force of the decree
and attachment, are not evidences of a prior and superior
equity on the part of the appellees, but .posterior and inferior
to the equities of the appellants.
7. That the appellants were in a predicament to re-examine

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

the decrees of the courts of Virginia against John R. Williams,
the appellants not being parties, nor concluded by those decrees.
8. That this court ought not to decree against these appellants barely upon the foot of the decrees against John R. Williams, but will examine the grounds of those decrees before
they make a new one.
9. That there is no basis for divesting the appellants of
their legal titles and possession, nor for calling into activity
the extraordinary powers of a court of equity, but abundant
reasons for refusing to interfere against the interests of the appellants.
The decree of the circuit court is erroneous.
1. In divesting the title and possession of William Caldwell, acquired under his contract of 30th of August 1815, and
his patent of 12th of November 1816.
2. In divesting Samuel Brents of his equity under his contract of 31st of August 1815, and, also, in divesting his title
and possession to eight hundred and fifty acres, acquired thereunder by his deed of 1818.
3. In divesting the defendants, William Caldwell, Isaac
Caldwell, and Samuel Brents, of their equities and legal advantages under their joint contract of 6th of January 1818.
4. In divesting Brents of his legal title acquired under his
deed for eight hundred and fifty acres, and his other interests,
without any allowance for services and expenses in surveying
and obtaining the grants.
5. In sustaining the bill and making a decree, when the
court should have refused to interfere, but leave the complainants to their remedy upon the deeds of John R. Williams.

Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is an appeal from a decree pronounced in the court of
the United States for the district of Kentucky, directing the
appellants to release and convey to the appellees, all the right
and title which they hold, jointly or severally, in the tracts of
land in the bill mentioned, with special warranty against
themselves.
The bill filed in January 1824, by Sarah Carrington, widow'
and devisee of George Carrington deceased, claims from the
defendants as purchasers from John R. Williams, heir at law of
John Williams deceased, -Tho is not an inhabitant of Kentucky, and therefore not a party to the suit, all the military
lands of the said John Williams lying in the district of Kentucky, amounting to four thousand acres, which land was sold.
as is alleged, by John Williams in his life time to George Carrington, the testator of the plaintiff in the circuit court. This
claim is founded on a decree pronounced by the county court of
Halifax, in the state of Virginia, sitting in chancery in November 1817, on a bill filed in November 1815, by the said Sarah
Carrington against the said John R. Williams, and on a deed
of conveyance made, on the 18th day of March 1820, by the
said John R. Williams to the said Sarah Carrington, in pursuance thereof. This decree was affirmed. on appeal. The
bill also refers to a suit brought by George Carrington, in his
life time against the guardians of the said John R. Williams
while an infant, in which a decree was obtained, directing the
guardian of the said John R. Williams to convey and assign
the entries and surveys of the said military lands to the said
George Carrington. The plaintiff prays that these decrees,
with the proceedings on which they were founded, and the
conveyances made in pursuance of them, should be taken as a
part of his bill.
The bill filed in the county court of Halifax, in November
1815, charges that George Carrington in his life time exchanged certain lands lying in the said county with John

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

Williams deceased, for a military claim of four thousand acres
to which the said Williams was entitled. That the said
George, by the direction of the said Williams, caused his land in
Halifax to be conveyed to a certain John Camp who was put
in possession thereof, but the patents for the military lands
not having been issued, no conveyance was made of the legal
title to them. Some time after the death of the said Williams
the said Carrington instituted a suit in the court of Halifax,
against John Robert Williams, then an infant, the only child
of the said John Williams, to obtain an assignment of the entries and surveys for the said four thousand acres of military
land. As the bill filed in that suit contains a full statement of
the contract with a description of the land it claims, the plaintiff prays that it may be taken as a part of the present bill as
fully as if literally inserted.
On the 23d of May 1803, a decree was pronounced in the
said suit, which, among other things, directed a certain John
B. Scott, the then guardian of the said John R. Williatms, to
assign the entries and surveys of the said military lands to the
said George Carrington, so as to enable him to obtain patents
therefor in his own name, and did further order that the said
John R. Williams should, on attaining his age of twenty-one
years, release all his right to the said George Carrington. The
plaintiff prays that this decree and all the proceedings in the
suit may be taken as a part of his bill. The assignments
directed by the decree were made by the said John B. Scott,
but George Carrington departed this life soon afterwards, not
having obtained the patents. By his last will he devised these
lands to the plaintiff, who has applied for patents, but is informed at the land office, that the assignment of the said
Scott does not authorize the register of the land office in Kentucky to issue them. The said John R. Williams having
attained his full age, not only refuses to release his claim
and to assign the said entries and surveys, but has gone to
Kentucky with a view of selling the said lands. The-bill
prays for an assignment of the entries and surveys, and a release of the right of the said John R. Williams, and that lie
may be enjoined from performing any act which may disable
him from making a complete title to the plaintiff.
The defendant in his answer denles the contract, and adds,

SUPREME COURT.
[Caldwel and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

that if such a contract did exist, it was verbal, that no note or
memorandum thereof was signed by either of the parties, and
that it is void by the statute of frauds which he pleads.
A general replication was filed and depositions were taken,
after xbich the following entry was made. "And now at this
day, to wit, at a court holden for the said county at the court
house thereof, on the 27th day of October 1817, came the
parties by their counsel, by whose consent this cause was this
day heard upon the bill, answer, examinations of witnesses, the
bill, answer, examnationsof witnesses in a cause formerly depending in this court between George Carrington, plaintiff, and the
defendant, by his guardian, defendant, and was argued by
counsel, on consideration whereof, it is decreed and ordered,
that the defendant do forthwith assign to the plaintiff in a proper and legal manner, the surveys and other title papers in the
original bill mentioned. The defendant having appealed from
this decree, it was affirmed at a superior court of chancery held
at the town of Lynchburg, on the 19th day of May 1818."
In pursuance of these decrees, the said John R. Williams
did, on the 18th day of March, in the year 1820, by his indenture of that date, convey to the plaintiff, the military lands in
the bill mentioned, consisting of one tract of five hundred acres,
lying on Beaver creek, also of one other tract of three hundred
and fifty acres, likewise lying on Beaver creek, also of one
other tract of one thousand acres, lying on Russel's creek; also
of one other tract of one hundred and fifty acres, lying on the
first creek emptying into Little Barren, also of one other tract
of one thousand acres, lying in the county of
being
the tract of land entered by John Williams on the 2d of August
1784, and also of one other tract of land containing one thousand acres lying in the county of
entered on the 10th
of August 1784.
The bill filed in this cause farther charges, that Samuel Brents,
William Caldwell and Isaac Caldwell, citizens of the state of
Kentucky, with full knowledge of the plaintiff's claims, entered
into a contract, on or about the 6th day of January 1818, with
the said John R. Williams, for the purchase of the two tracts of
one thousand acres each, lying south of the Tennessee, for which
entries had been made by the said John Williams in his life time
on the 2d and 10th of August 1784, and that the said William

[Caldwell and others v. Carrngton's Heirs.]

Caldwell on the 30th of August 1815, with full knowledge of the
right of the plaintiff, entered into a contract with the said John
R. Villiams, for the purchase of the tract of one thousand acres,
near the town of Columbia, in the county of Adair, and that
the said Samuel Brents also, with the full knowledge of the
plaintiff's title, hath entered into a contract with the said John
R. Williams for the said tracts, containing five hundred acres,
and three hundred and fifty acres, lying on Beaver creek, in the
county of
and for the tract containing one -hundred
and fifty acres lying on the first creek emptying into the Little
Barren, in the county of
Under these contracts and
other papers obtained from the said John R. Williams, the said
Samuel Brents, William Caldwell and Isaac Caldwell, who are
made defendants, have obtained legal titles to the said military
surveys, and have also obtained assignments or transfers of the
entries for two tracts of one thousand acres each, lying south
of the Tennessee, for which they will obtain patents, unless
restrained by order of this court.
The bill prays that the defendants may be decreed to convey
to the plaintiff, and for general relief.
The defendants filed separate answers, each denying the
contract, insisting that if any contract existed, it was by parol
and consequently void by the statute of frauds, and claming
to be purchasers without notice of any equity in the plaintiff.
The several defences are now to be examined.
The proceedings in the county court of Halifax, in the suit
brought in 1815, are perfectly regular, and, according to the
constitution and laws of the United States and the decisions of
this court, are allowed the same full faith and credit in the
courts of Kentucky, that they would receive in Virginia. If
the decree pronounced by the court of Halifax in 1817, and
afterwards affirmed in the superior court of chancery at Lynchburg, would have been enforced in Virginia, or if, had it been
pronounced in Kentucky, it would have been enforced in Kentucky, then the decree for enforcing it which was pronounced
by the court of the United States sitting in Kentucky is correct.
The first point to be considered is the contract itself. It is
not in writing, and consequently admits only of parol evidence.
Paul Carrington, the father of George, deposes that he owned
a tract of land in the county of Halifax , called Dry Branch,

SUPREME COURT
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs ]

containing five hundred and ninety-sixacres, the whole of which,
at the close of the revolutionary war, he gave to his sou George,
put him, in possession, delivered the title papers, and directed
him to prepare a deed. In 1787 or 1788, George requested
the deponent to convey the land to John Williams, to whom
he had sold it, in exchange for his military lands in Kentucky
Some little time afterwards, George requested the witness to
convey the land to George Camp, to whom Williams had sold it.
He conveyed to Camp. Some short time afterwards Williams
and George Carrington were both at the house of the deponent,
when Williams stated that he had purchased the land from
George Carrington and sold it to Camp for 400 pounds. He has
also frequently heard George Camp say that he purchased the
land from Williams for 400 pounds. Has never heard Williams
say he gave his military lands for the Dry "Branch tract.
Clement Carrington has paid the taxes on the Kentucky
military lands, on account of the estate of George Carrington,
ever since they were taxed.
Nathaniel Terry was acquainted with the Dry Creek tract,
and has heard Williams say he had given his western lands
for it. He supposed Williams to have been in possession of the
Dry Branch tract, but he never worked hands on it. Carrington did not work it after the sale to Williams, farther than to
finish his crop.
James Eastham has frequently heard colonel John Williams
say, that he had given his lands in the western country to
George Carrington, in exchange for the Dry Branch tract,
which he afterwards sold to George Camp.
William Yancy has heard John Williams say, that he purchased the Dry Branch tract from George Camp, and had given
his claims to land in the western country in payment for it.
He has been frequently in company with the said John Williams, when this trade was the subject of conversation, and
Williams always gave the same account of it. Williams sold
the Dry Branch tract to George Camp.
Thomas Roberts well recollects to have heard John Williams
say, that he had exchanged his Kentucky lands with George
Carrington for his Dry Branch tract.
The depositions of William Yancy and Thomas Roberts were
taken in the suit brought against the guardian of John R. Wil-

[Caldwell and others v. Carrngton s Heirs.]

liams, but as they were filed with the bill of 1815, and read
by consent at the hearing, they are supposed to form a part of
the record in this cause.
No counter testimony was offered.
We think the exchange by John Williams of his military
land for the Dry Branch tract is fully established, and proceed
to inquire into the validity of the contract.
The statute of frauds, of which the defendants claimed the
benefit, avoids parol contracts for land, and will unquestionably
avoid that between John Williams and George Carnngton,
unless the transactions between the parties take the case out
of the statute. The appellees maintain the affirmative of this
proposition, and contend that the complete execution of the
contract on the part of George Carrington, by conveying the
Dry Branch tract to the vendee of John Williams, supplies in
law the want of a memorandum in writing. For a considerable length of time this principle appeared to be firmly settled
in the court of chancery in England. 'Maddock, inhis Treatise on Chancery, vol. 1, p. 301, says, "if therefore it be
clearly shown what the agreement was, and that it has been
partly performed, that is, that an act has been done, not a
mere voluntary act, or merely introductory or ancillary to the
agreement, buL a part execution of the substance of the agreeinent, and which would not have been done unless on account
of the agreement, an act, in short, unequivocally referring to,
and resulting from the agreement, and such that the party
would suffer an injury amounting to fraud, by the refusal to
execute that agreement, in such case the agreement will be
decreed to be specifically performed. 2 Br. Cha. Ca. 140, 1
Br. Cha. Ca. 412, 3 Atk. 4, 2 Anstr. 424, Ambl. 586, 1 Sch.
& Lef. 41, 14 Ves. 386
This principle has been lately questioned in England, and,
some of the judges have thought, has been carried too far, but
it has not, we believe, been overruled.
It was undoubtedly supposed in Virginia to be the sound construction of the statute, when this contract was made, and as
the land then lay in Virginia, Kentucky being then a part of
that state, this construction forms the law of the contract. In
affirming the decree of the 27th of October 1817, the chancellor said, "the court being of opinion that this is not a case

SUPREME COURT
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington'sHeirs.]

embraced by the act against frauds and perjures, doth adjudge, &c." A change of the law afterwards made in Kentucky, cannot affect contracts previously valid.
It remains to inquire, whether the appellants are to be considered as purchasers without notice of the equity set up by the
appellees.
The defendants do not deny notice, in those explicit terms
which courts of equity require. They deny notice of a valid
claim, but not such notice as ought to put them on inquiry.
They are the joint purchasers of the two tracts of one thousand acres each, lying south of Tennessee river. They purchased these tracts from Williams on the 6th of January 1818.
The articles of that date recognize the claim of Carrngton's
heirs, and contain a stipulation on the part of Williams, "to
use due diligence in having it extinguished and quieted."
William Caldwell purchased the tract of one thousand acres
in the county of Adair, on the 30th day of August 1815.
The contract of that date contains this stipulation "and the
said Williams agrees that the said Caldwell shall not be bound
to pay any farther part of the consideiration aforesaid, except
what is this day paid, until he, the said Williams, shall settle
the dispute between himself and the heirs and representatives
of George Carrington deceased, concerning the title to the said
land."
A contract was entered into between Williams and Samuel
Brents on the 31st day of August 1815, by which Brents engages, for a part of the land, "to attend to the securement of
the titles to the said lands," "1according to the laws of the state,
by surveying, registering, and patenting the same, or by doing
such other acts as may be necessary for the purposes aforesaid."
He says in his answer, that on the 12th of November 1816,
patents issued to the said John R. Williams for two tracts on
Beaver creek, the one for three hundred and fifty acres, and
the other for five hundred acres. The defendant agreed to
take the tract of three hundred and fifty acres, and one hundred and fifty acres, part of the five hundred acre tract, for his
services. Afterwards, on the 5th of January 1818, he.contracted for the residue of the two tracts, for which he received
a conveyance dated on the same day. The answer proceeds,
"at the time of receiving the said conveyance, or at any time

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Caldwell and others v. Carrington's Heirs.]

before, this respondent had no knowledge or information of any
valid claim to said land, by any other person than the said John
R. Williams. This respondent does not now recollect of hearing any thing of the claim of the complainants before his conveyance, but had only heard that some verbal or illegal claim
was set up in some bill filed in some county court of Virginia,
of which verbal claim this respondent did not think himself
bound to take notice."
He does not recollect that the claimant was named Carrington, but he does recollect having heard that a suit was instituted in one of the county courts of Virginia. but as the contract
was by parol, he did not think himself bound to notice it. Now
he knew, or might have known, that the suit was instituted in
the county of Halifax, that being the residence of Williams,
whose agent lie was, and who was the defendant in the suit,
He could have received full information from Williams himself, who never attempted to conceal the claim. His conveyance of the two thousand acres of his claim, lying south of the
Tennessee nver, dated the day after his conveyance to Brents,
contains a stipulation respecting the claim of Carrington's heirs,
showing plainly that the claim was previously well known to
the parties. His deed to William Caldwell shows that it was
known as early as 1815.
Isaac Caldwell's claim is limited to his third part of the two
thousand acres south of Tennessee, conveyed on the 6th of
January 1818. In addition to the notice contained in the
deed, he states in his answer, that he had seen the proceedings
in the suit brought by Carrington against Williams, in which
the decree of 1803 was pronounced, had consulted eminent
counsel on it, and had been advised that the title of Williams
would prevail over that set up by Carrington. Under this advice he purchased. The record contains other evidence, to
which it is thought unnecessary to refer.
In addition to these unequivocal proofs, that the appellants
had received notice of the contract made by Carrington with
John Williams, it is worthy of observation, that with the exception.of Brents, they purchased equitable titles, and were
bound to notice any prior equity.
It is too clear for controversy that the plaintiffs placed full
confidence in the protection fumished by the statute of frauds,

[Caldwell and others v. Cirrington's'Heirs.

and believed that the contract made between Carnngton and
Williams, being by parol was void, notwithstanding its full
execution on the part of Carrington.
There is no error in the decree of the circuit court, and it is
affirmed, with costs.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States for the district
of Kentucky, and was argued by counsel, on consideration
whereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed by this court, that
the decree of the said circuit court in this cause be, and the
same is hereby affirmed, with costs.
