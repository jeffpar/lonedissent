A claim to lands in east Florida, the title to which was derived from grants
by the Creek and Seminole Indians, ratified by the local authorities of
Spain before the cession of Florida by Spain to the United States; confirmed.
It was objected to the title claimed in this case, which had been presented to
the superior court of middle Florida, under the provisions of the acts of
congress for the settlement of land claims in Florida, that the grantees did
not acquire, under the Indian grants, a legal title to the land. Held, that the
acts ofcongress submit these claims to the adjudication of this court as a
court of equity; and those acts, as often and uniformly construed in its repeated decisions, confer the same jurisdiction over imperfect, inchoate and
inceptive titles, as legal and perfect ones, and require the court to decide by
the same rules on all claims submitted to it, whether legal or equitable.
By the law of nations, the inhabitants, citizens, or subjects of a conquered or
ceded country, territory, or province, retain all the rights of property
which have not been taken from them by the orders of the conqueror; and
this is the rule by which we must test its efficacy according to the act of
congress, which we must consider as of binding authority.
A treaty of cession is a deed or grant by one sovereign to another, which
transferred nothing to which he had no right of property; and only such
right as he owned, and could convey to the grantee. By the treaty with
Spain, the United States acquired no lands in Florida to which any person had lawfully obtained such a right, by a perfect or inchoate title, that
this court could consider it aspropertyunder the second article, or which had,
according to the stipulations of the eighth article of the treaty, been granted
by the lawful authorities of the king. which words grants or concessions were
to be construed in their broadest sense, so as to comprehend all lawful acts
which operated to transfer a right of property, perfect or imperfect.
The effect of the clauses of the confirmation of grants made was, that they confirmed them presently on the ratification of the treaty, to those in possessZon
of the lands; which was declared to be that legal seism and possession which
follows title, is co-extensive with the right, and continues till it is ousted by
an actual adverse possession, as contradistinguished from residence and occupation.

712

SUPREME COURT

[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]
terms of the eighth arThe United States, by accepting the cession under tile
ticle, and the ratification by the king, with an exception of the three annulled grants to Allegon, Punon Rostro, and Vargas, can make no other
exceptions of grants made by the lawful authorities of the king.
The meaning of the words lawful authoritiesin the eighth article, or competent authorities in the ratification, must be taken to be " by those persons
who exercised the granting power by the authority of the crown." The
eighth article expressly recognizes the existence of these lawful authorities in the ceded territories, designating the governor or intendant, as the
case might be, as invested with such authority- which is to be deemed
competent till the contrary is made to appear.
By "1the laws of Spain" is to be understood the will of the king expressed in
his orders, or by his authority, evidenced. by the acts themselves; or by
such usage and customs in the province as may be presumed to have emanated from the king, or to have been sanctioned by him, as existing authorized local laws.
In addition to the established principles heretofore laid down by this court as
the legal effect of an usage or custom, there is one which is peculiarly appropriate to this case. The act of congress giviig jurisdiction to this court
to adjudicate on these causes, contains this clause in reference to grants, &c.,
"1which was protected and secured by the treaty, and which might have
been perfected into a complete title, under and in conformity to the laws,
usages and customs of the government under which the same originated."
This is an express recognition of any known and established usage or custom
in the Spanish provinces, in relation to the grants of land, and the title
thereto, which brings them within a well established rule of law - that a
custom or usage saved and preserved by a statute has the force of an express statute, and shall control all affirmative statutes in opposition, though
it must yield to the authority of negative ones, which forbid an act authorized by a custom or usage thus saved and protected, and this is the rule by
which its efficacy must be tested, according to the act of congress, which
must be considered of binding authority
In the case of The United States v. Arredondo, 6 Peters 691, the lands
granted had been in the possession and occupation of the Allachua Indians,
and the centre of the tract was an Indian town of that name. But the land
had been abandoned, and before any grant was made by the intendant, a
report was made by the attorney and surveyor general on a reference to
them, finding the fact of abandonment, on which it was decreed that the
lands had reverted to and become annexed to the royal domain.
By the common ]Lw, the king has no right of entry on lands which is not
common to his subjects; the king is put to his inquest of office, or information of intrusion, in all cases where a subject is put to his action, their
right is the same, though the king has more convenient remedies in enforcing his. If the king has no original right of possession to lands, he
cannot acquire it without office, joined so as to annex it to his domain.
The United States have acted on the same principle in the various laws
which congress have passed in relation to private claims to lands in the
Floridas; they have not undertaken to decide for themselves, on the validity of such claims; without the previous action of some tribunal, special or
judicial. They have not authorized an entry to be made on the possession
-zf any person in possession, by colour of a Spamsh grant or title, nor the

[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]
sale of any lands as part of the national domain, with any intention to impair private rights. The laws which give jurisdiction to the district courts
of the territories to decide in the first instance, and to this on appeal, prescribe the mode by which lands which have been possessed or claimed to
have been granted pursuant to the laws of Spain, shall become a part of the
national domain; which, as declared in the seventh section of the act of 1824,
is a " final decision against any claimant pursuant to any of the provisions
of the law."
One uniform rule seems to have prevailed in the British provinces in America
by which Indian lands were held and sold, from their first settlement, as
appears by their laws-that friendly Indians were protected in the possession of the lands they occupied, and were considered as owning them by a
perpetual right of possession in the tribe or nation inhabiting them, as their
common property, from generation to generation, not as the right of the
individuals located on particular spots. Subject to this right of possession,
the ultimate fee was in the crown and its grantees; which could be granted
by the crown or colonial legislatures while the lands remained in possession of the Indians; though possession could not be taken without their
consent.
Individuals could not purchase -Indian lands without permission or license
from the crown, colonial governors, or according to the rules prescribed by
colonial laws; but such purchases were valid with such license, or in conformity with the local laws, and by this union of the perpetual right of
occupancy with the ultimate fee, which passed from the crown by the
license, the title of the purchaser became complete.
Indian possession or occupation was considered with reference to their habits
and modes of life; their hunting grounds were as much in their actual possession as the cleared fields of the whites; and their rights to its exclusive
enjoyment in their own way and for their own purposes were as much respected, until they abandoned them, made a cession to the government, or
an authorized sale to individuals. In either case their rights became extinct,
the lands could be granted disencumbered of the right of occupancy, or
enjoyed in full dominion by the purchases from the Indians. Such was the
tenure of Indian lands by the laws of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode
Island, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.
Grants made by the Indians at public councils, since the treaty at Fort Stanwick's, have been made directly to the purchasers or to the state in
which the land lies, in trust for them, or with directions to convey to them,
of which there are many instances of large tracts so sold and held, especially
in New York.
It was an universal rule, that purchases made at Indian treaties, in the presence and with the approbation of the officer under whose direction they
were held by the authority of the crown, gave a valid title to the lands: it
prevailed under the laws of the states after the revolution, and yet continues
in those where the right to the ultimate fee is owned by the states or their
grantees. It has been adopted by the United States, and purchases made
at treaties held by their authority have been always held good by the ratification of the treaty, without any patent to the purchasers from the United
States. This rule in the colonies was founded on a settled rule of the law
of England, that by his prerogative the king was the universal occupant of
VOL. IX°-4 P

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]
all vacant lands in his dominions, and had the right to grant them at his
pleasure, or by his authorized officers.
When the Uaited States acquired and took possession of the Floridas, the
treaties which had been made with the Indian tribes before the acquisition
of the territory by Spain and Great Britain, remained in force over all the
ceded territory as the laws which regulated the relations with all the
Indians who were parties to them, and were binding on the United
States, by the obligation they had assumed by the Louisiana treaty, as
a supreme law of the land, which was inviolable by the power of congress. They were also binding as the fundamental law of Indian rights,
acknowledged by royal orders, and municipal regulations of the province,
as the laws and ordinances of Spain in the ceded provinces, which were
declared to continue in force by the proclamation of the governor in taking
possession of the provinces; and by the acts of congress, which assured all
the inhabitants of protection in their property. It would be an unwarranted construction of these treaties, laws, ordinances and municipal regulations, to decide that the Indians were not to be maintained in the enjoyment of all the rights which they could have enjoyed under either,
had the provinces remained under the dominion of Spain. It would be
rather a perversion of their spirit, meaning and terms, contrary to the injunction of the law under which the court acts, which makes the stipulations of any treaty, the laws and ordinances of Spain, and these acts of congress, so far as either apply to this case, the standard rules for its decision.
The treaties with Spain and England before the acquisition of Florida by the
United States, which guarantied to the Seminole Indians their lands according to the right of property with which they possessed them, were adopted
by the United States; who thus became the protectors of all the rights they
had previously enjoyed, or could of right enjoy under Great Britain or
Spain, as individuals or nations, by any treaty, to which the United States
thus became parties in 1803.
The Indian right to the lands as property was not merely of possession, that
of alienation was concomitant; both were equally secured, protected and
guarantied by Great Britain and Spain, subject only to ratification and confirmation by the license, charter or deed from the governor representing the
king. Such purchases enabled the Indians to pay their debts, compensate
for their depredations on the traders resident among them to provide for
their wants; while they were available to the purchasers as payment of the
considerations which at their expense had been received by the Indians.
It would have been a violation of the faith of the government to both, to
encourage traders to settle in the province, to put themselves and property
in the power of the Indians, to suffer the latter to contract debts, and when
willing to pay them by the only means in their power, a cession of their
lands, withhold an assent to the purchase, which by their laws or municipal
regulations was necessary to vest a title. Such a course was never adopted
by Great Britain in any of her colonies, nor by Spain in Louisiana or Florida.
The laws made it necessary, when the Indians sold their lands, to have the
deeds presented to the governor for confirmation. The sales by the Indians transferred the kind of right which they possessed, the ratification of
the sale by the governor must be regarded as a relinquishment of the title of

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.J
the crown to the purchaser, and no instance is known where permission
to sell has been "refused, or the rejection of an Indian sale."
In the present case the Indian sale has been confirmed with more than usual
solemnity and publicity; it has been done at a public council and convention of the Indians conformably to treaties, to which the king was a party,
and which the United States adopted, and the grant was known to both
parties to the treaty of cession. The United States were not deceived by
the purchase, which they knew was subject to the claim of the petitioner, or
those from whomhe purchased, and they made no stipulation which should
put it to a severer test than any other; and it was made to a house which in
consideration of its great and continued services to the king and his predecessor, had deservedly given them high claims as well on his justice as his
faith. But if there could be a doubt that the evidence in the record did
not establish the fact of a royal license or assent to this purchase as a matter of specific and judicial belief, it would be presumed as a matter of law
arising from the facts and circumstances of the case, which are admitted or
unquestioned.
As heretofore decided by this court, the law presumes the existence in the
provinces of an officer authorized to make valid grants; a fortiori, to
give license to purchase and to confirm; and the treaty designates the
governor of West Florida as the proper officer to make grants of Indian
lands by confirmation as plainly as it does the governor of East Florida to
make original grants, or the intendant of West Florida to grant royal lands.
A direct grant from the crown of lands in a royal haven may be presumed
on an uninterrupted possession of sixty years, or a prescriptive possession
of crown lands for forty years.
The length of time which brings a given case within the legal presumption of a
grant, charter, or license, to validate a right long enjoyed, is not definite,
depending on its peculiar circumstances.
After the case had been fully heard in the superior court of middle Florida,
the judge of that court, in examining the evidence in the case with a view
to its decision, considered that he had discovered in the date of the water
mark in the paper on which one of the original Spanish documents had
been written, a circumstance which brought into doubt the genuineness of
the instrument. No objection of this kind had been made duripg the argument of the cause , and after the supposed discovery, no opportunity was
permitted, by the court of Florida,' to the claimants, to explain or account
for the same. After the appeal had been docketed in this court, the appellants asked permission to send a commission to procure testimony, which it
was alleged would fully explain the circumstance, and offered to read ex
parte depositions to the same purpose. By the Court. This is refused. because in an appellate court, no now evidence can be taken or received, without violating the best established rules of evidence. Under such circumstances, it would be dealing to the petitioner a measure of justice incompatible with every principle of equity, to visit upon his title an objection
which the claimant was not bound to anticipate in the court below, which
he could not meet there, and which this court were compelled to refuse him
the means of removing by evidence, We will not say what course would
have been taken, if his title had depended on the date of the paper alluded
to: as the case is, it is only one of numerous undisputed documents tend-

[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]
ing to establish the grant, the validity of which is but little if it could be in
any degrce affected by the date of the permission.

APPEAL from the superior court.of middle Florida.
The appellants, on the 181h day of October 1828, presented
to the superior court of middle Florida, their petition under
the authority of the sixth section of the act of congress passed
on the 23d of May 1828, entitled an act supplementary to
the several acts providing for the settlement and confirmation
of the private land claims in the territory of Florida, and of
the act of 1824, referred to in the said act, authorizing claimants in Missouri to iistitute proceedings to try the validity of
their titles.
The appellants claimed title to a tract of land containing
one million two hundred thousand acres, in the territory of
Florida, the greater part of which was situated between the
rivers Appalachicola and the St Mark's, comprehending all
the intervening sea coast, and the islands adjacent.
The title was asserted to be held under deeds from the
Creek and Seminole Indians to Panton, Leslie and Company, to
John Forbes and Company, and to John Forbes. and confirmed by the authorities of Spain.
These lands, the petitioners alleged, were granted by the
Indian tribes, as an indemnity from the Spanish government
and from those Indians, for losses sustained by them in prosecuting a trade with the Indians, under the special and exclusive license of Spain.
The Indian grants were dated on the 25th May and the
22d August 1804, and the 2d August 1806, and were alleged
to have been confirmed by governor Folch, the governor of the
province.
The facts of the case, and all the documents on which the
title of the petitioners was claimed to rest, with the evidence
in the case, are fully stated in the opinion of the court.
The answer of the district attorney stated that the commissioners under the act "for the settlement of private land
claims, and for the confirmation thereof" were instructed to
report, and not to decide upon large claims, that the claim of
the petitioners was reported upon by the commissioners, and

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

their report laid before congress-but it was denied that the
documents presented to the said commissioners and by them
reported, were, by the said report, "admitted to be genuine."
The title of the appellant is invalid. Congress did not confirm or adopt the report of the commissioners upon this
claim, but referred all claims not annulled by the treaty of
cession, nor by the decree of the king of Spain ratifying the
same, nor reported by the commissioners as antedated or
forged, to the decision of the judiciary.
The cause was heard in the superior court of middle Florida, on the evidence adduced by the pelitioners and the
United States and on public documents, all of which were
sent up with the record, and was finally disposed of by a decree of the judge of that court, entered on the 2d of November
1830, dismissing the petition.
The petitioners appealed to this court. The appeal was
entered to January term 1831.
At former terms of this court, on the motions of the counsel for the United States, the case was postponed to enable
the government of the United States to procure papers from
Madrid and from Havana, which were considered important
and necessary in the cause. These motions were always
resisted by the counsel for the appellants.
At January term 1834, the case was continued, under an
order of the court that it should not be argued before the 2d
of February 1835.
On the 9th of January, Mr Butler, attorney-general of the
United States, moved the court to postpone the hearing of the
case until later in the" term than the day fixed for the
same, alleging that the documents which had been expected
from Havana had not arrived, and that the government had
despatched a special messenger for them, whose return was
expected before the 25th of February, during the term. The
court refused to hear the motion until the case should be
called, on or after the 2d of February. Afterwards, on the 9th
of February, the motion was renewed on the part of the United
States, by the attorney-general, and was overruled, the court
not thinking it necessary to hear the counsel for the appellants
against it.

SUPREME COURT
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

The cause then came on, and was argued by Mr White and
Mr Berrien, for the appellants, and by the attorney-general
and Mr Call, for the United States.
For the appellants, the following points were submitted to
the court.
1. That the Indian sales of 1804 and 1811, and the several
acts in confirmation thereof by the governor of West Florida,
vest in the grantees a full and complete title to the land in
controversy.
2. That the king of Spain was bound, in good faith, to indemnify the house of Forbes & Co. for the losses sustained by
them in their traffic with the Indian tribes; that the satisfaction
of the claims of that house, which was effected by these sales,
and the consequent release of the obligation of the king of
Spain to indemnify them, constituted a sufficient consideration
to the Spanish crown for any right of pre-emption or-otherwise
which it might have had in these lands.
3. That these sales, having been made with the knowledge,
assent and previous approbation of the authorities of Louisiana
and West Florida, having been subsequently ratified and confirmed by the civil and military governor of the latter province,
having been notified to the captain-general of Cuba, and by
him to the king, and not having been disapproved by either
thatthese several acts and omissions amount to an acquiescence
on the part of the king of Spain and his legitimate authorities,
which, according to the laws and usages of that kingdom,
would vest a valid title in the grantees.
4. That the decision of the captain-general of Cuba, on the
petition of John Forbes, setting forth his title to these lands,
and praying leave to sell the same, is a judicial decision upon
the validity of that title by the highest legitimate authority of
that captain-generalcy, to which West Florida was an appendage, and cannot be drawn into question in any other tribunal.
5. That the grantees, and those claiming under them, have
had legal possession, in good faith, by just title, since the date
of the respective grants, which constitute a title by prescription
under the laws of Spain.
6. That the title thus subsisting in the grantees, by the
aforesaid sales and acts of confirmation, by the acquiescence,

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

after notice, of the king of Spain and his legitimate authorities,
by the judicial decision of the captain-general of Cuba, and
by the right of prescription, at the date of the delivery of the
Floridas to the United States, was a valid and legal title,
which was recognized and confirmed by the treaty of cession.
For the United States, it was contended by Mr Butler and
Mr Call
I. Admitting it to be true, for the sake of argument,
1. That the house of Forbes & Co. had rendered important
services to the Spanish government, and had well founded
claims on its bounty;
2. That the king of Spain was bound, in good faith, to indemnify the house, for the losses sustained by them in their
traffic with the Indians,
3. That the government of the United States had knowledge
of the existence of that house, of its claims on Spain, and of
the title on which the present suit is founded,
4. That the vacant and ungranted lands in the Floridas,
even if the present claim be confirmed, will yet be more than
the government of the United States, at the time of the cession,
expected to receive, and,
5. That other equitable circumstances exist, which entitle
the claim to a favourable regard.
Still it is contended, on the part of the United States,
that no valid reason can be found, in either or all of these circumstances, for reversing the decree of the court below
That decree must be affirmed, unless it can be shown that
the claimants, at the time of the cession, had a legal right to
the lands in question, acquired either,
1. By virtue of a grant or concession, made before the 24th
of January 1818, by his catholic majesty, or by his lawful
authorities, or,
2. By virtue of some other valid title, known to, and recognized by the laws of Florida.
II. The most important of the suggestions above referred to,
viz. the alleged liability of the king of Spain to indemnify
Forbes & Co. for their losses, &c., is not correct in point of
fact. Neither the law of nations, nor any special promise, not
any existing treaty, imposed on him any such obligation.

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

Besides, if such obligation existed, ihe duty of auditing and
settling the accounts belonged alone to the intendancy of the
province, and the Spanish government could not be bound for
the payment of any particular demand, on the mere admission
of the Indians.
III. The claim, in the present case, though of land within
the territorial limits of the Floridas, does not profess to be
founded on any original substantive grant made by the king
of Spain or his officers, but on cessions made by Indian tribes,
and on alleged ratifications and confirmations thereof, and acquiescence therein, by the Spanish authorities. In this respect,
the present case differs from all the cases hitherto submitted to
this court.
IV The Indian deeds to Panton, Leslie & Co. did not,
either in themselves, or with the confirmation thereof by governor Folch, convey to the grantees therein named, any legal
right to the lands in question.
1. According to the laws of Spain, in force in the Floridas,
the absolute title in the soil, in all the lands described in the
deeds, was, at the execution thereof, exclusively vested in the
crown of Spain. The Indians, by those laws, were regarded
as having no title whatever, except in and to such tracts as
were left in their possession by the Spanish authorities, in conformity to the laws of the Indies, and no part of the premises
in question were so allotted.
2. If the title of the Spanish crown was qualified, in respect
to lands in the Floridas, by any Indian right of occupancy, that
right existed only in favour of such Indian tribes, if any, as
actually inhabited the lands, and as had not previously surrendered it, and the Spanish crown possessed the absolute and
exclusive right to extinguish it.
3. The lands in question were, in fact, at the time of the
cessions, vacant and uninhabited, and therefore no Indian right
of occupancy could exist therein.
4. The original Indian right of occupancy, if any ever existed, from the shores of the gulf, as far as the flowing of the
tide up the bays, rivers and inlets, in the premises in question,
was extinguished by solemn compact between the government
of Great Britain and the Indians, in the year 1765 and by the
treaty of 1783, Spain sucdeeded to all the rights of soil and

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.J

sovereignty, previously possessed by the British crown. As to
the greater part of the lands described in them, the Indian deeds
were therefore invalid.
5. The deeds were executed by Indians, residing, with a
trivial exception, within the territorial limits of the United
States. The cessions were not the act of the Seminole nation,
every town and village of which was interested in the Indian
right of possession.
6. The Indians could not sell to the subjects of Great Britain, land within thejurisdiction of Spain, on which was erected
the fortress of St Mark's, then occupied and garrisoned by the
troops of Spain, and since ceded and delivered by the Spanish
government to the United States.
7. William Panton and John Leslie, of the house of Panton,
Leslie & Co., were both dead, and no such firm existed in
Florida as that of Panton, Leslie & Co., at the time of executing the several deeds, and at the time of their confirmation
by governor Folch.
8. Panton, Leslie & Co. were foreigners. They had not
taken the oath of allegiance to the crown of Spain, without
which they could receive no grant of land in Florida, from the
subordinate officers of the government.
9. There is no proof that the governors-general of Louisiana
authorized or approved the purchases in question.
10. The original acts of confirmation of the Indian sales, by
governor Folch, to the house of Panton, Leslie & Co., and to
the house of John Forbes & Co., have not been produced by
the petitioners, nor their absence satisfactorily accounted for.
There is no evidence then, that any formal titles were given
by governor Folch, to the grantees, for the land in question.
11. Governor Foleh had no power to ratify and confirm the
Indian cessions in question
(1.) Because the power to ratify such cessions was not
within the scope of his general authority, nor had he any
special authority to ratify the same.
(2.) Because the lands, with a small exception, were situated within the province of East Florida, and out of his jurisdiction.
(3.) Because the royal order of 1798 vested in the rntendants the exclusive power of granting and conceding all kinds
VOL. Ix.-4 Q

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchell and others v. The United States.]

of land, and at the date of the supposed grants, Juan Ventura
Morales was intendant of West Florida.
V If the titles executed by governor Folch could be considered as original substantive grants (which is by no means
admitted), they would still be invalid, by reason of their repugnancy to the laws, ordinances, usages and regulations of the
Spanish government. As to the lands in East Florida, they
must certainly be invalid.
VI. The facts and circumstances attending this case, and
relied on by the appellants, do not amount to any such acquiescence on the part of the king of Spain and his lawful authorities, as would, according to the laws and usages of that
kingdom, vest a valid title in the grantees. And all presumption of such acquiescence is conclusively rebutted by the subsequent grants actually made by the king himself.
VII. No title by prescription exists in this case.
VIII. The permission granted by the captain-general of the
island of Cuba, to the house of John Forbes & Co., to sell the
lands in controversy to Colin Mitchell, related only to the lands
described in the cession of 1804, and was not a judicial decision on the validity of the title. It created no estate either in
the grantees or those claiming under them.
IX. The captain-general of the island of Cuba, had no jurisdiction over the lands in Florida. The royal domain of
Florida was under the exclusive control and superintendence
of the intendancy.
X. The various circumstances and arguments relied on by
the appellants, being, for the reasons above stated, each of
them insufficient in itself, to sustain the present claim, they
must, from the peculiar nature of this case, be equally insufficient in the aggregate.
XI. The United States have a clear title to the fortress
of St Mark's and its appurtenances, which, even if the claim
be allowed in other respects, must be excepted by definite
bounds therefrom, and should have been so excepted in the
petition.
On the 14th of March, the case having been argued, and the
opinion of the court being about to be delivered by Mr Justice
Baldwin, Mr Butler and Mr Call, for the United States, moved
to postpone the final disposition of the case until next term.

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

The Attorney-General stated, that the messenger who had
been despatched to Havana, had on the day preceding returned
to the city of Washington, and had brought with him documents of great importance to the just decision of the case, and
that information had been received by the department of state,
that other documents, showing the action of the government
of Spain in relation to titles to lands in Florida, were preparing
in Havana by the consul of the United States there, who had
been specially commissioned for the purpose, which would be
received before the next session of the court. These documents were represented by the agent at Havana, to be very
important in the cause. The motion was opposed by Mr White,
Mr Ogden, Mr Berrien and Mr Webster, of counsel for the
appellants; and supported by Mr Call and Mr Butler. The
motion was held under advisement until the 17th of March,
when
Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL said
The court has taken into its serious and anxious consideration, the motion made on the part of the government to continue the cause of Mitchel v. The United States to the next
term.
Though the hope of deciding causes to the mutual satisfaction of parties would be chimerical, that of convincing them
that the case has been fully and fairly considered, that due
attention has been given to the arguments of counsel, and
that the best judgment of the court has been exercised on the
case, may be sometimes indulged. Even this is not always
attainable. In the excitement produced by ardent controversy, gentlemen view the same object through such different
media, that minds not unfrequently receive therefrom precisely
opposite impressions. The court however must see with its
own eyes, and exercise its own judgment guided, by its own
reason.
The motion is founded on the expectation, that by the next
term admissible evidence may be obtained, which will shed
much light on this cause, and change essentially its present
character. This motion is opposed on the ground that the delays have already been excessive, that a farther continuance
for twelve months would affect one of the parties most in]u-

SUPREME COURT
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

riously; and that no rational foundation is laid, for the opinion,
that new and important additions will or can be made to the
information the record at present contains.
The cause was docketed on the 2d of February 1831. OR
the 26th of the same month a motion was made on the part of
the United States, to bring on the cause for argument at that
term. This motion was opposed and was overruled. The reasons of the court are not recollected, but the motion was in
opposition to a positive rule, and must for that cause alone
have been rejected.
In March 1832, the parties were willing to bring on the
cause, but the court thought it too late in the term to take it
up, and it was continued.
In 1833 and in 1834 the cause was continued, on the motion
of the attorney for the United States, supported by the same
arguments which are now urged.
This cause was commenced in the district court of the
United States for the territory of Florida, in October 1828.
The degree of intelligence which has been employed in preparing the record for a final decision, gives the most absolute
assurance that from the commencement of the controversy, it
must have been perceived that the case depended essentially
on the sanction given by the authorities of Spain to the grants
made by the Indians. It was perceived, and great efforts were
made in the district court by both parties for the establishment
of this fact. A vast mass of evidence has been collected on
it, and is to be found in the record. An inspection of that
evidence goes far to establish the opinion, that it cannot be materially varied.
The government has unquestionably made great exertions,
we believe all that could be made, to obtain any additional
documents which the case may furnish. No difficulty has
been opposed by the Spanish government to the inquiries of
the American agents. On the contrary, every facility has
been gven to them. We cannot doubt that the most important documents would be the most immediately forwarded.
Those which have arrived have been inspected. They are
not believed to vary the case many of them are undoubtedly
important, but they were already in the record, and have been
considered. The transfer of all sales of crown lands from the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mlitchel and others v. The United States.]

political to the treasury department, from the governor to the
intendant, and the ordinance by which this change was
effected, were already in possession of the court, and had been
maturely considered. The documents referred to were chiefly
in the record.
We are not satisfied, from the communications of the agent
of the United States, that the additional papers to which he
alludes, and which he hopes to obtain, can materially affect
the merits of the case. With this strong impression on our
minds, we should not be justified in granting a still further
continuance. The opinion of the court will be delivered.
Mr Justice BALDWIRN delivered the opinion of the Court.
The land in controversy is claimed by the United States,
in virtue of the treaty of cession by Spain, by which the
territory and sovereignty of the two Floridas were acquired,
in consideration of 5,000,000 dollars, paid in extinguishment
of certain claims of the citizens of the United States on the
government of Spain. Colin Mitchel claims, by deeds from
various tribes of Indians belonging to the great Creek confederacy, to Panton, Leslie & Co., to John Forbes & Co.,
and to John Forbes, confirmed by the local authorities of
Spain, whose right has become vested in him by sundry
mesne conveyances, to which it is unnecessary to referas the regular deraignment of whatever title was vested in
the original grantees to the present claimants is not questioned.
(Record 362.) The lands are in four separate
tracts, extending from the mouth of the river St Mark's, outside of the islands along the sea coast, to the west end of St
Vincent's island, west of the mouth of the river Appalachicola,
thence to that river about five miles from its mouth, up the
same for many miles, thence by a back line to a point on the
western bank of the St Mark's above the old fort of that name,
and down the said river to the sea. It is unnecessary to refer to
the boundaries of the separate tracts, or the particular designation of the lines and points of the whole body of lands, as
they are not a subject of controversy in this case, the quantity, as estimated by the claimant, is one million two hundred
and fifty thousand acres (Record 5), and by the Spanish
officers, one million three hundred and ninety-one thousand
arpents. (Record 224.) The history of the claim is this.

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

The commercial house of Panton, Leslie & Co. had long
been established at St Augustine, in east Florida, it had extensive connexions and great credit in England, and its operations were very great. After Spain had taken possession of
the Floridas, in virtue of the treaty of peace in 1783, the king,
by a royal order, gave them license to carry on and continue
their commercial operations in those provinces and Louisiana.
(Record 164-167, 236-281, 157-160.) As they were an
English house, an oath of allegiance was required, which was
taken by Mr Panton, (Record 127, 128) and by Mr Leslie, for
himself and the other members of the firm who were not in
the province (Record 275, 281, 282) in 1786, with which the
Spanish government was satisfied, as a compliance with the
royal orders of the same year. (Record 160-164).
This house conducted its affairs to the entire satisfaction of
the successive governors-general of Louisiana (Record 120129) and the local authorities of the Floridas, rendered Important services to the crown, met with many and great losses,
amounting, by the estimate of the marquis of Casa Calvo, then
governor-generalof Louisiana, in 1800, to 400,000 dollars. (Record 125, 136, 147, 148.) Five of his predecessors had recommended the awarding some indemnity to the house, they had
made repeated claims upon the crown, the justice of which
had been acknowledged by all the local authorities during
all the changes of administration (Record 121, 122, 132, 133,
134), in their numerous despatches to the ministry, which had
been submitted to the king. (Record 130, 374.) They concurred in representing to the king the great importance and
services of the house as a political instrument of the gdvernment, that they had a right to indemnity from the king, that
the situation of the house was such, that they must sink under
their losses if it was not afforded, and that it must be sustained
and preserved as indispensable to retain any control over the
Indians, and secure the possession of the provinces entrusted to
their care. (Record 130, 139, 143-152, 151, 252-257, 302,
580.)
In consequence of the repeated solicitations of the house to
the king for compensation, a royal order was directed to the
captain-general of Cuba on the subject of the indemnities
proper to be given them, in reply to which, among other propositions made by the governor-general of Louisiana, was a grant

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mlitchel and others v. The United States.]

of twenty leagues square of royal lands west of the Mississippi,
or a loan of 400,000 dollars without security (Record 144,
145.) This shows the sense of that high officer of the value
of the services of the house, the extent of their losses in their
exertions in favour of the government, with the measure of
remuneration which he considered to be due of right in 1800.
(Record 144, 147 )
Among the losses sustained by the house, was a large
amount due by the Seminole Indians prior to 1800, and for
robberies of their stores in 1792 and 1800, by members of that
tribe, headed by the celebrated adventurer Bowles, exceeding
in all 60,000 dollars (Record 22-28), of which they were
unable to procure any payment from the Indians, but who
had expressed a willingness to make compensation by a grant
of their lands.
Early in 1799 the house made an application to the governor-general of Louisiana for leave to purchase from the Indians
as much land as would satisfy the above claims, which was
favourably received by both him and his successor. (Record
54, 56.) Negotiation with the Indians was followed by a deed
of cession from them, m 1804, of the large tract containing
one million two hundred thousand arpents. (Record 554.)
This deed was confirmed at a general council of the nation
and its chiefs held at Pensacola in 1806, in the presence of
Folch, governor of West Florida (Record 568, 584, 590, 614),
in all the form and solemnity which Indians could give it.
This governor had previously given leave to make the purchase
on a petition presented to him by the house in January 1804,
setting forth the circumstances of the case, which was granted
on only one condition, that they should not dispose of the lands
without notice to and knowledge of the government, and in
December 1806, gave his full confirmation to the grant of the
Indians made to Panton, Leslie & Co. (Record 58, 84.)
Another application was made to the same governor in
1807, for his permission to make an additional purchase from
the same Indians, which was granted in December 1810, on
condition that the house should cede the whole or part of the
lands to the king, if he should want them, at the price at which
they acquired them, and not dispose of them without notice to
the government. (Record 273, 274, 275.) In the following

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

year the Indians granLed the other tracts between the rivers
Wakulla and St Mark's, including the fort, which was also
confirmed by the governor (Record 606), at a great public
council of the Indians at Pensacola, this tract contained by
estimation ninety-seven thousand arpents. At the same time
another tract on the sea coast, including some islands at and
west of the mouth of the Appalachicola, was in like manner
granted by the Indians and confirmed by the governor to John
Forbes & Co., the successors of Panton, Leslie & Co. (Record 106)
containing sixty-five thousand arpents. At the same time and
place there was granted and confirmed to John Forbes an island
in the Appalachicola, containing six thousand eight hundred
arpents, for which no consideration was paid, the grant being
a gratuity by the Indians to Forbes, in consideration of his
services and friendship rendered and shown to them for years
before. (Record 217-224.) It is not deemed necessary to
recite more specially the various original deeds from the In-,
dians, or those made in councils after the lines had been marked
which designated the boundaries of the respective grants, nor
the grants of the governor of West Florida, confirming them
by titles in form delivered to the parties, they are in form and
substance alike (Record 28-106, 430, 447), and no question
has arisen on their terms.
Those of the Indians recite the considerations which led to
the grants, convey the lands with a warranty of their title by
ascertained boundaries (Record 39, 40, 49, 91, 95, 86, 93, 69,
82-84, 29-36, 59, 63, 95-108, 562), those of the governor
ratify and confirm the grants in full and direct dominion (Record 37, 49, 91, 95, 111) and in full property, put the grantees
in possession, and promise to defend and maintain it, (Record
106, 137, 145) all of which he declares is done by using the
powers vested in him. (Record 75-91,30-37,99, 233,234.)
They are drawn up in great form, contain a perfect recogiiition of the Indian grants, and give to them all the validity
which he could impart to them. (Record 106, 131, 175, 191,
193.) They are made in the name of the king, executed and
attested in all due formality, and their authenticity proved as
public documents, and by the testimony of witnesses to the
official signatures. (Record 562, 579, 615, 620, 623, 646, 611,
612, 613-626). The claims of the house upon the Indians

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

for debts due since 1789 and depredations committed, were
notorious to the government and inhabitants of Pensacola,
(Record 273, 274, 536, 590) as were the purchases, and
their confirmation by the Indians, at which two thousand are
computed to have attended in 1811 (Record 592, 601), is
proved as a fact by witnesses present in the different councils,
so is the fact of the ratification by the governor. (Record 579,
614, 615, 620, 623, 646.) The original deeds, and the demarcation of lines and boundaries were made (Record 42, 43,
100, &c.) in the presence of the commandant at St Mark's,
(Record 73, 97, 104, 108), exercising the offices of lieutenant
governor and subdelegate of the intendancy, or were approved
by him every act done in relation to the cessions and their
ratification, from the first application to the governor-general
in 1799 to their consummation in 1811, was public and notorious to both Indians and whites. (Record 590.) Governor
Folch reported all his proceedings to the captain-general of
Cuba, by whom they were approved, who declared that the
king would confirm them, and, as some of the witnesses say,
declared that he had confirmed them. (Record 228, 229,
232, 568, 572, 584, 594.) From the time of the first, cession
in 1804, the Indians acknowledged the validity of the grants,
were satisfied with them, called the land the white land, or the
land of the whites, (Record 606) asked permission from the
house to hunt upon them, and with the exception of some occasonal depredations, respected their possessions and property
(Record 619-621, 623.) Their title too was equally respected by the local government, and all the officers of the king
(Record 234, 574, 624, 625) nor from him to the lowest does
there appear to have been expressed any dissatisfaction at any
of the acts of governor Folch, or the least doubt of the perfect
validity of the title, though the claim of the house to the
whole land conveyed was perfectly known and evidenced by a
partial actual possession, taken at an early period and continued
till the cession of the provinces. (Record 620, 624, 625.)
There is no evidence in the record, that either the Indians, the
governor, or intendant ever made a cession, grant, order of survey, or gave permission to settle within the boundaries of any
of the grants. It is also a circumstance of no small consideration, that notwithstanding the long and inveterate controversy
VOL. ix.-4 it

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitehel and others v. The United States.]
between the governor and intendant about their powers to grant

lands even in small tracts, there was none in relation to these.
Yet the intendant had full notice of them, spoke of them, but
made no objection (Record 571) or preferred any complaint to
the captain-general or the king, although the quantity of land
thus granted to this house was nearly double to the whole
amount of the grants of royal lands made by the government
of West Florida. (Record 421, 469.) It was also proved, that
in the opinion of those who know the land, as well as the officers of government, it was not worth, at the time, the amount
of the just claims of the house on the Indians, that the grants
were taken as the only means of their indemnification, and
that the purchase was much less advantageous to them than
to the king, who thereby became absolved from a claim not
only too just to deny, but too large to satisfy with convenience.
(Record 570-574, 579, 556, 573, 625.) It is also proved,
that the Indians who made the cessions occupied the lands for
hunting grounds, were deemed the owners of them as Indian
lands, and had three settlements upon them previously, (Record 559, 565, 576, 585) and that the country was claimed by
the Seminoles. (Record 12, 52, 607.) The lines were marked
by persons appointed by the governor in presence of the Indians,
who consented to them, (Record 621-623, 632) and the governor gave formal possession to the house (Record 625) according to the plats of the several grants exhibited to him,
which the witnesses declare to have corresponded with the
lines marked upon the ground, and those recited in the deeds
and petitions. (Record 623.)
In opposition to this mass of documentary and parol testimony, in support of the allegations of the petitioners, that the
grants were in fact made and confirmed, in the manner, and
for the reasons and considerations set forth, no direct evidence
appears in the record. Some of the witnesses were examined
as to the supposed influence of the house with governor Folch,
but the imputationwas negatived, and the proceedings throughout declared to have been in good faith. (Record 554-583.)
So far then as the merits of the case depend on the genuineness of the deeds and documents, the facts of the grants and
confirmations by the Indians and governor, the marking the
lines and possession of the land, the good faith of the whole

JANUARY TERM 1835.
(Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

transaction, the absence of fraud, the authority of the Indian
chiefs, as representatives of their respective tribes, we entirely
concur in opinion with the court below. That the grants
were made bona fide, for a valuable consideration, of the adequacy of which the Indians were competent judges, if they had
any right in the lands which they could convey, that the
ratification of the governor was fairly and fully nade, and for
good and sufficient reasons, of which he was the judge, if he
had competent authority to give effect and validity to Indian
cessions of the land in controversy. The view which the
learned judge took of these questions, after a thorough, searching examination of the documents and evidence, is so entirely
satisfactory, that we have only to express our assent to the
conclusions at which he arrived. (Record 662-669.)
There is, however, one subject which was considered by
him, into which we do not feel at liberty to inquire, which is
the water-mark in the paper on which the governor's permission of the 7th of January 1804, was written, noticed and commented on at large by the judge. (Record 706.) This
objection was not made in the court below, at the hearing, or
in the argument, so that no opportunity was afforded to the petitioner to produce any evidence on the subject, or to his counsel to answer the objection. This court also refused to grant
him a commission to take testimony to explain and account for
the water-mark, or permit him to read the ex parte evidence
offered to explain it, because in an appellate court no new evidence could be taken or received without violating the best
established rules of evidence and law. Under such circumstances, it would be dealing to the petitioner a measure of
justice incompatible with every principle of equity, to visit upon
his title an objection which hewas not bound to anticipate in
the court below, which he could not meet there, and which
this court were compelled to refuse him the means of removing by evidence. 'We will not say what course would
have been taken if his title had depended on the date of the
paper alluded to, as the case is, it is only one of numerous
undisputed documents tending to establish the grant, the validity of which is but little, if it could be in any degree affected
by the date of the permission.
It is objected by the counsel of the United States, that the

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

original acts of confirmation of the Indian sales by governor
Folch are not produced, and that the copies in evidence are
not legal proof of such acts. This objection seems to us
not to be well founded in fact or law. The original Indian deeds were procured by the agent of the United States
from the public archives in Havana (Record 529, &c.) and are
now before us. The deeds of confirmation were made according to the rules of the civil law adopted by Spain, and in force
in Florida and Cuba, the original is a record, and preserved in
the office, which cannot be taken out, a testimonto or copy is
delivered to the party, which is deemed to be and is certified
as an original paper, having all the effect of one in all countries governed by the civil law Such is proved to be the law
of those colonies, as a fact, by Mr White (Record 628), such
is the form of the certificates in this case, varying in phraseology somewhat, but agreeing in substance and effect (Record
19, 38, 45, 50, 58, 91, 106, 111), in perfect accordance with
the civil law adopted in Louisiana, and recognized by this
court in the case of Owings v. Hull, decided at the present
term. We therefore consider those now produced as original
deeds of confirmation by the governor, duly certified and
proved.
It is objected, that the deeds of 1804 and 1806, to Panton,
Leslie & Co. were inoperative to pass the lands, they having
died previously.
It is in proof as a fact that Forbes & Co. were the successors in business and interest to Panton & Co. This change of
the name and partners of the house after the death of Mr Panton was known to the officers of the local government and the
king, who by a royal order in 1805, (Record 262) and another
in 1807, (Record 270) directed that it should have no effect
on their privileges. To the king it mattered not whether the
lands were conveyed to the house as a firm, or to the partners
nominatim, they, it seems, preferred considering the lands as
a part of the general effects of the partnership, and received
the deeds accordingly, as it concerned only them, and as there
has been produced no law of Spain invalidating such a grant,
the objection cannot be sustained.
Another objection, on account of an oath of allegiance not

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mlitchel and others v. The United States.]

having been taken by the grantees, is removed by the evidence
already referred to, and need be no further considered.
It is objected that the grant of 1811 is invalid, because it
comprehends the fort of St Mark's, then actually occupied by
the troops of the king. It is in full proof that the site of St
Marks and the adjacent country was within the territory
claimed by the Seminole Indians (Record 12, 131, 603-607,
618.) It is not certain, from the evidence, whether it was purchased from the Indians, or merely occupied by their permission there seems to be no written evidence of the purchase,
but no witness asserts that possession was taken adversely to
the Indian claim, and it is clearly proved to have been amicably done. (Record 232, 306, 581.) Whether the Indians
had a right to grant this particular spot then or not, cannot affect the validity of the deeds to the residue of the lands conveyed in 1811. The grant is good, so far as it interfered with
no prior right of the crown, according to the principles settled
by this court in numerous cases arising on grants by North
Carolina and Georgia, extending partly over the Indian boundary, which have uniformly been held good, as to whatever
land was within the line established between the state and the
Indian territory. Wear v Danforth, 9 Wheat. 673, Patterson v Jenckes, 2 Peters's Rep. 216, and Winn v Patterson, decided by the supreme court of the United States, January 1835,
ante 663. As to the land covered by the fort and appurtenances, to some distance around it, it becomes unnecessary to inquire into the effect of the deeds, as the counsel of the petitioners have in open court disclaimed any pretensions to it.
Another objection is of a more general nature, that the grantees did not acquire a legal title to the lands in question. But
it must be remembered, that the acts of congress submit these
claims to our adjudication as a court of equity, and, as often
and uniformly construed in its repeated decisions, confer the
same jurisdiction over imperfect, inchoate and inceptive titles
as legal and perfect ones, and require us to decide by the same
rules on all claims submitted to us, whether legal or equitable.
Whether, therefore, the title in the present case partakes of
the one character or the other, it remains only for us to inquire whether that of the petitioner is such in our opinion that

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

he has, either by the law of nations, the stipulations of any
treaty, the laws, usages, and customs of Spain, or the province
in which the land is situated, the acts of congress or proceedings under them, or a treaty, acquired a right which would
have been valid if the territory had remained under the dominion and in possession of Spain.
In doing so, we shall not take a detailed review of the leading
cases on Spanish grants already decided by this court, in relation to those lands which formed a part of the royal domain, in
contradistinction to those which may be considered as Indian
lands claimed by Indians, by their title, whatever it may be.
Those comprehended within the claim of the petitioners being
of the latter description, as they contend and thereupon rest
their title, it will suffice to state some general results of former
adjudications which are applicable to this case, are definitively
settled, so far as the power of this court can do it, and must
be taken to be the rules of its judgment. They are these
That by the law of nations, the inhabitants, citizens, or subjects of a conquered or ceded country, territory, or province,
retain all the rights of property which have not been taken from
them by the orders of the conqueror, or the laws of the sovereign who acquires it by cession, and remain under their former
laws until they shall be changed.
That a treaty of cession was a deed or grant by one sovereign to another, which transferred nothing to which he had
no right of property, and only such right as he owned and
could convey to the grantee. That by the treaty with Spain
the United States acquired no lands in Florida to which any
person had lawfully obtained such a right by a perfect or inchoate title, that this court could consider it as properly under
the second article, or which had, according to the stipulations
of the eighth, been granted by the lawful authorities of the
king; which words grants or concesswns were to be construed
in their broadest sense, so as to comprehend all lawful acts
which operated to transfer a right of property, perfect or imperfect. 6 Peters 710, 7 Peters 86, 88, 8 Peters 445, 449,
450, 486.
That the effect of the clauses of confirmation of grants made
was that they confirm them presently on the ratification of the
treaty, to those in possesston of the lands, which was declared

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

to be, that legal seisin and possession which follows a title, is
coextensive with the right, and continues till it is ousted by
an actual adverse possession, as contradistmguished from residence and occupation. 6 Peters 743, 8 Cranch 229, 230, 4
Wheat. 213, 233, 4 Peters 480, 504, 506, 5 Peters 354, 355.
That the United States by accepting the cession under the
terms of the eighth article, and the ratification by the king,
with an exception of the three annulled grants to Allegon,
Punon Rostro, and Bargas, can make no other exceptions of
grants, made by the lawful authorities of the king. 8 Peters
463, 464.
That the meaning of the words lawful authorities in the
eighth article, or competent authorities in the ratification,
must be taken to be "by those persons who exercised the
granting power by the authority of the crown." That the
eighth article expressly recognizes the existence of these lawful authorities in the ceded territories, designating the governor or intendant; as the case might be, as invested with such
authority, which is to be deemed competent till the contrary
is made to appear. 8 Peters 449 to 453.
That "by the laws of Spain" is to be understood the will of
the king expressed in his orders, or by his authority, evidenced
by the acts themselves, or by such usages and customs in the
province as may be presumed to have emanated from the king,
or to have been sanctioned by him, as existing authorized local
laws. 6 Peters 714 to 716.
In addition to the established principles heretofore laid down
by this court as to the legal effect of an usage or custom, there
is one which is peculiarly appropriate to this case. The act
of congress giving jurisdiction to this court to adjudicate on
these causes, contains this clause in reference to grants, &c.,
":which was protected and secured by the treaty, and which
might have been perfected into a complete title, under and in
conformity to the laws, usages and customs of the government
under which the same originated." 6 Peters 708, 709, 3
Story's Laws 1959, 1960.
This is an express recognition of any known and established
usage or custom in the Spanish provinces, in relation to the
grants of land and the title thereto, which brings them within
a well established rule of law. That a custom or usage saved

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

and preserved by a statute has the force of an express statute,
and shall control all affirmative statutes in opposition, though
it must yield to the authority of negative ones, which forbid
an act authorized by a custom or usage thus saved and protected, 4 Co. Inst. 86, 298, and this is the rule by which we
must test its efficacy according to the act of congress, which
we must consider as of binding authority.
In taking possession of Florida pursuant to the treaty, and
in establishing a government in and over it, congress have acted
on the same principles as those which were adopted by this
court in the former cases. In the act of 1821, for carrying
the treaty into execution, congress authorizes the vesting the

may direct for the maintaining the inhabitants in the free enjoyment of their property. Pamphlet Laws 47.
The governor thus appointed, by his proclamation in the
same year, announces to the inhabitants that he has been invested with all the powers, and charged with all the duties
heretofore held and exercised by the captain-general and of
the intendant of the island of Cuba over the Floridas; and the
governor thereof; recites the foregoing act of congress, declares
that they shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their property, &c., and that all laws and municipal
regulations which were in existence at the cessation of the
late government remain in full force. Pamphlet of 1822, 113.
The tenth section-of the act of 1822 contains the same
pledge for the protection of property, and the thirteenth continued in force the existing laws, till altered by the local legislature then organized. Pamphlet 15.
The formal act of the surrender of the Floridas by Spain to
the United States was made by the commandants of both of
the provinces, by the authority of the captain-general of Cuba
under a royal order. Pamphlet 110.
These are most solemn acts of both governments, which,
as the proceedings under the treaty of cession, are made a rule
for our guide in deciding on the validity of the title to lands
in the provinces, they have all been ratified and approved by
the king and congress, affording the highest possible evidence
of the true meaning of both the high contracting parties to
the treaty. They point directly to the kind of government

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

which existed before the cession as being vested in the captaingeneral and intendant of Cuba, and the governors of the provinces, as the supreme legislative, executive, and judicial
power, subordinate to the king only And as it became afterwards in the hands of the governor alone by act of congress
subordinate only thereto, while under both, the government
was administered in conformity to the local laws and municipal regulations. It cannot therefore be doubted that among
the other powers of the former government, that of granting
lands was invested in some of its officers, nor that such officers were the governor, the intendant, or captain-general, as
the case might be, thus exhibiting a union of opinion between the king of Spain as well as the legislative and judicial
departments of this government, as to the meaning of the
treaty, which cannot be Without its influence on its true construction and bearing on the rights of parties now before this
court sitting in an appellate court of equity, directed to decide "in conformity to the principles of justire" and the laws
and ordinances of the government under which the claim of
the petitioner originated, they must be our guide.
Colin Mitchel claims the land in controversy as a purchaser

from Panton, Leslie & Co., John Forbes & Co., and John
Forbes, who were purchasers from the Seminole or Tallapoosa
Indians, bona fide, for a valuable consideration paid by one
party, and received by the other by force or contract, accompanied with the legal seisin and possession of the whole, and
actual pedispossessto of a part, under a claim of right and title
to the whole by grant. The equity of the parties from whom
Mitchel purchased commenced in 1789, 1790, 1792, when the
depredations were first committed and the debts contracted
which formed the consideration of the Indian deeds, the debts
increasing till 1800, and the depredations then renewed. A
claim early made on the Indians for compensation and on the
government of Spain for indemnity, continued till an agreement for the cession of lands by the former was fnade in 1800,
and carried into effect in 1804 and 1806, when it was carried
into grant, ratified and confirmed by the Indians, the governor
of West Florida, and captain-general of Cuba, without an
interfering claim till the cession to the United States in 1820,
1821. On the other hand, the United States claim the land

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States,]

by purchase from the king of Spain, made bona fide, for a valuable consideration fully paid, but with full and direct notice
of the equity of Forbes & Co., and the purchase in the name
of Panton, Leslie & Co., of which Forbes was partner, which
notice was as early as 1804 (Record 283, 286, 290, 291, 568).
The earliest equity claimed by the United States was in January 1818, when the cession was first proposed, the first
agreement to convey by Spain was in 1819, the date of the
treaty; and the final grant was made in 1820, the date of the
ratification, and possession first taken in 1821, pursuant to the
conveyance of the treaty.
Thus viewing the contending parties, we proceed as a court
of equity to inquire, whether at the time the cession by the
treaty took effect in favour of the United States there wag a
right of property in Colin Mitchel to the lands included in his
grants, or whether they had been previously granted by the
lawful authorities of the king. That they were granted in
fact is incontestable, and they were private property, if there
was a grant competent by law to vest a title.
It is contended by the United States that the acts of governor
Folch, in the permissions to purchase from the Indians, and
the ratifying and confirming their deeds, are void, as the
lands were not in West Florida, over which province alone lie
had any jurisdiction.
There seems no doubt that under the British government
the river Appalachicola remained the boundary between East
and West Florida, as it was so established by the proclamation
of the king in 1763 (1 Laws U. S. 444), but it does not appear
that Spain had adopted it in administering the government of
those provinces by any royal order, or that such was a common
opinion of the inhabitants (Record 602 to 604) on the contrary, it appearm that so early as 1785, Don Galvez, then governor-general of Louisiana, considered the district of St
Mark's de Appalachy as a dependency of his government,
and in 1686 placedit under care of the government of West
Florida, and ordered the establishment of a post there by a detachment from the garrison of Pensacola, which acts were
approved by a royal order in March 1787 (Record 306, 197).
These orders were acquiesced in by the governor of East Florida, who appearsfto have exercised no jurisdiction within that

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

territory, or to the west of it, after 1786 (Record 260). There
is abundant evidence in the record that that post, the circumjacent territory, with what lies between it and the Appalachicola, was a dependency on and subject to both the civil and
military jurisdiction of the governor of West Florida, and was
so considered by all the officers of the government, the captain
general and the king, as appears from many documents
(Record 163, 165, 167, 168, 189, 190, 201, 202, 203, 209,
227, 228, 234, 236, 266, 267, 297, -298, 304). The fact of
the exercise of jurisdiction over that territory by the governor
of West Florida is also established by the concurring tqstimony of many witnesses, (Record 582, 600, 601, 602, 604) as
is also the fact of its surrender by him-to the United States as
a part of the territory under his command.
(Record 602,
Laws of 1832, pamphlet 112.)
But evidence of the fact still more conclusive, and its most
solemn recognition by both governments, is to be found in the
formal act of surrendering the sovereignty and possession of
the province by Spain to the United States. The governor
of West Florida "placed the commissioner of the United States
in possession of the country, territories and dependencies of
West Florida, including the fortress of St Mark's, with the
adjacent islands, dependent on said province." (White 198,
Pamphlet Laws 112.) So it was accepted and is yet held by
the United States, and so we must consider it as understood
by congress in the various laws passed since the cession, and
the proceedings therein authorized under the treaty in reference to East and West Florida. The boundary between them
must be taken to be thatwhich existed under Spain from 1785
till 1821, as incontestably proved, and most solemnly admitted by the United States, up to which the powers of the governor of West Florida, whatever they might be, could be
exercised in their plenitude, both as a government de facto
and a government de jure.
It becomes needless to inquire whether, after these solemn
acts, it is competent for the United States to now contest the
existence of such boundary, it suffices for this case, that it is
abundantly established by all the evidence, which is uncontradicted, and that the lands in controversy are situated within
West Florida, according to the boundaries recognised by both

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

governments. This objection cannot therefore be allowed to
prevail. It is next contended, that the power to grant lands
in West Florida was not vested in the governor, but was confided exclusively to the intendant, this is clearly proved to be
the settled law of that province as to royal lands, which were
the property of the crown, and is admitted by the counsel of
the petitioner.
But the reverse is, we think, equally apparent as to Indian
lands, until their right had been abandoned, and the land become annexed to the royal domain by a process in the nature
of an office at common law (White 25, 40, 42, 79, 43, 47,
215.) The relations between the Indians and the government
of Spain, were considered as matters of the deepest political
concern, in nowise connected with its fiscal operations, the
commerce with the Indians was, as a political instrument, entrusted exclusively to the governors, as clearly appears by their
correspondence with each other, the captain-general of Cuba,
and the ministry in the mother country, and-regulated by royal
orders (Record 113-153) with which the intendancy had
nothing to do. (Record 151, 57!, 579, 586, 587, 590, White
32.)
It was a part of the governor's oath, as prescribed by the
laws of the Indies, "that you shall take care of the welfare,
increase and protection of the Indians." (Record 237.) He
was their protector, whose duty it was to examine whether
claims upon them were well founded, and if so, contribute by
all possible means to their being paid, (Record 587) but not to
lend his sanction, or allow the smallest injury to be done to
them. (Record 571, 232.) The fact of the supervision of Indian sales of their land by the governors of provinces and commandants of posts, in acts of confirmation and putting the purchasers in possession, is very clearly established by the report of
the land commissioners of the United States in Louisiana. (Record 325-333.) It was exercised by Don Galvez, governor
general of Louisiana, as early at least as 1777, in confirming
an Indian sale of the great Houma tract on the Mississippi
(1 Laws U. S. 551, 552, 554), and there is no evidence
that this power was ever entrusted to or conferred on any
otaer officer, nor that it was ever exercised by any other.
It was an authority expressly delegated to them by the laws,
(White 232-234) and so reported by-the commissioners (Re-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.I

cord 329), proved also as a fact by the former secretary of the
province (Record 572) and Governor Folch (Record 231234). It cannot, indeed, be well questioned that the governors
and commandants of posts were the appropriate officers for
these purposes, in the absence of any evidence of confirmations by intendants, with positive evidence of their approbation
by the captain-general of Cuba, in making (Record 12) formal
acts of confirmation without objection by the ipteridant-general of Cuba, or by local intendants. When to these considerations is added another, arising from the circumstance of
there being no instance of the rejection or disaffirmance of a
deed confirming an Indian sale by any of the superior authorities in the provinces, or by the king, as is clearly established
(Record 336, 627, 628) and admitted in the argument, we
cannot feel authorized to declare that governor Folch usurped
any powers vested in the intendant, in any of his acts relating
to these lands.
The confirmation of similar grants made by acts of congress,
or by boards of commissioners acting under their authority, are
also powerful evidence of the lawful exercise of the authority
of these officers, and being proceedings under the treaty and
laws, they are made a rule by which among others we may
adjudicate on the claims of the present parties, in doing which
we cannot sustain this objection without overlooking such a
concurrence of evidence of various descriptions, as leaves no
reasonable cause of a doubt of the authority of governor Folch,
especially when we connect with his first permission to make
the purchase of 1804, the condition attached to it, that the
lands should not be disposed of without the giving notice to
and knowledge of the government, and to that of 1811, that
it should be conveyed to the king, if required, at the price at
which it was purchased, and the mode in which that condition was performed and released.
Pursuant to these conditions, John Forbes applied to the
captain-general of Cuba, in 1817, for permission to sell the
land to the petitioner, which being referred to the assessor-general for his advice, he reported that the lands had been transmitted actually and lawfully in full property to Mr Forbes,
with a conditional title, or "titulo oneroso," for which acquisition competent permission was given by governor Folch, who

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitehel and others v. The United States.]

delivered titles of confirmation subsequently, whereupon a
formal permission was given by the captain-general to make
the sale, which was a direct approbation of all the proceedings
authorized by that governor, as well as that he was the officer
designated for such purpose. (Record 12, 52, 53.) Such a
confirmation by an officer subordinate only to the king, performed so long after the acts done by the governor of a province
who was under the control of the captain-general, must be
referred to his legitimate authority competent for the purpose.
It was done also on the deliberate advice of an officer responsible to the crown, which makes the presumption very strong,
if not irresistible, that every thing preceding it had been lawfully and rightfully done. (White 25, 40, 43, 47, 49.) This
proceeding is in the nature of an inquest of office, in analogy
to the writ of ad quod damnum, which by the common law
precedes the grant of any charter, license, or patent of the
king, of any thing which may be injurious to his or the rights
of others, on which an inquesL is taken, on whose report the
king acts, on the advice of the proper officer or tribunal, makes
the grant or withholds it, as advised. (3 Bla. Coin. 259, 17
Vin. Ab. 171, 176, 7 Day's Coin. Dig. 80.)
The report of the assessor-general seems to have been acted
on as an inquisition at common law, finding that there was
no obstacle to the making-use of the powers entrusted to the
captain-general. We should feel it to be an assumption of
much responsibility to declare thaton the evidence inthis record,
and the law arising upon it, that either of the officers referred
to usurped powers not vested in them, or exercised them against
or without the authority of the king.
The counsel of the United States pressed in argument the
decision of this court in the case of Arredondo, as an affirmance
of the right of the intendant of the province, or of Cuba, to
grant Indian lands. In that case the lands granted had been
in the possession and occupation of the Allachua Indians, and
the centre of the tract was an Indian town of that name. But
the land had been abandoned, and before any grant was made
by the intendant a report was made by the attorney and surveyor-general on a reference to them, finding the fact of abandonment, on which it was decreed that the land had reverted
to and become annexed to the royal domain.

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchol and others v. The United States.]

Considering this to be a judicial act in the nature of an inquest of office, and the decree of the intendant as making the
fact a res adjudicata, we did not feel at liberty to look behind
it for the evidence on which it was founded, the consequence
of which was, that by the judgment of a competent tribunal,
the land was part of the royal domain, subject to the disposition of the intendant. There is no pretence of a similar proceeding having been had in relation to these lands, nor could
there well be in opposition to the evidence in the record, especially the report of the assessor-general in 1817, that they were
the lands of the Seminoles at the time of the cession by them
and the confirmation by governor Folch. By the common law
the king has no right of entry on lands which is not common
to his subjects, the king is put to his inquest of office, or information of intrusion, in all cases where a subject is put to
his action, their right is the same, though the king has more
convenient remedies in enforcing his. If the king has no
original right of possession to lands, he cannot acquire it without office, found so as to annex it to his domain. (2 Co. Inst.
46, Saville 8, 9, pl. 20, Hob. 347, Hardress 460, 7 Day's
Com. Dig. 77, Gilbert's Ex. 109, 3 Bla. Com. 257, Fitz.
N. B. 90 b., 4 Co. 58b., 16 Vin. 552, 3Co. 10, 11,9 Co.
95, 96, 98, Hardress 51, 52, Plow 236, 486, 1 Co. 42, 5
Co. 52 b, Plow. 229, 230.) Such, too, seems to be the law of
Spain in the Floridas and Cuba, as appeared in the case of
Arredondo, and as it must have been understood by the Spanish authorities, when they acknowledged the Indian right to
lands in the harbour of Pensacola to be an existing one in 1816.
Nor is there any evidence in the record that their right ceased
to be respected, or that lands wnich had been in their possession became annexed to the royal domain, till some official
proceeding, founded on the law of Spain, in the nature of an
office by the common law, had taken place under the proper
authority. (White 25, 40, 37)
The United States have acted on the same principle in the
various laws which congress have passed in relation to private
claims to lands in the Floridas, they have not undertaken to
decide for themselves on the validity of such claims without
the previous action of some tribunal, special or judicial. They
have not authorized an entry to be made on the possession of

744

SUPREME COURT.

[MitcheI and others v. The United States.]
any person in possession, by colour of a Spanish grant or title,
nor the sale of any lands as part of the national domain, with
any Intention to impair private rights. The laws which give
jurisdiction to the district courts of the territories to decide in
the first instance, and to this on appeal, prescribe the mode by
which lands which have been possessed or claimed to have
been granted pursuant to the laws of Spain, shall become a
part of the national domain, which, as declared in the seventh
section of the act of 1824, is a "final decision against any
claimant pursuant to any of the provisions of the law"
Another objection is made to the title of the petitioner, on
the allegation that by the treaty of Picolata between Great
Britain and the Creeks in 1765, the Indians had ceded all the
lands in controversy between the sea and flow of the tide, in
virtue of which they became the property of the crown and
passed to Spain by the treaty of 1783.
The fifth article of the treaty of Picolata, made to prevent
encroachments on the lands or hunting grounds of the Creeks,
stipulates that the boundary of the province of East Florida
"shall be all the sea coast as far as the tide flows, in the manner settled with the great Tomachiches by the English," with
all the country particularly described therein, which they
grant and confirm to the king.
As this refers to a treaty or compact made with this chief, its
meaning must be sought in it, and unless something can be
found there which will make the expression more definite than
the general terms "all the sea coast as far as the tide flows,"
it will require great latitude of construction, as to an Indian
cession, to extend itfrom the St Mary's around the peninsula
of Florida to the mouth of the Appalachicola. The tract of
country ceded lies on the sea coast, east of a point formed by
a line run from the source of the St John's, which isits southern boundary, the western boundary is a line run from the
junction of the Ocklawaugh with the St John's northwardly
to the St Mary's, nearly parallel to the sea coast, at an average distance of about thirty miles west. It would be stretching the meaning of this treaty very far, to embrace within it
an extent of sea coast and contiguous land within the flow of
the tide to its whole extent, when the extent of the lands
ceded west of a line from the mouth of the Ocklawaugh to

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

the sea was so small. Before we could do it, it must appear
to have been so previously settled between the English and
Tomachiches, as is referred to in the treaty of Picolata. From
the account given in M'Call's history of Georgia, the treaty
with Tomachiches was held in 1733, and the cession of the
sea coast was only between the Altamaha and Savannah,
extending west to the extremity of the tide water. (1 M'Call's
Hist. 37 )
As this is the act referred to, it must be taken in connexion
with the subsequent treaty to make it certain by the reference,
(6 Peters 739) which entirely removes the objection, and
shows the cessions of the sea coast to be confined to that part
which is between the St Mary's and St John's rivers.
The report of the surveyor-general in 1817, is very full on
the subject of the boundaries between the British government
and the Indians in East and 'West Florida. (Record 184194.) He says, "with regard to East Florida, I have never
been able to discover that there has ever been any treaty or
agreement with the natives of that province concerning the
limits of their possession, nor in that of the Spanish authority."
As the surveyor-general had referred to the treaty of Picolata
in his report, it is clear that it was construed by the Spanish
government as it now is by this court.
We now come to consider the nature and extent of the Indian title to these lands.
As Florida was for twenty years under the dominion of
Great Britain, the laws of that country were in force as the
rule by which lands were held and sold, it will be necessary
to examine what they were as applicable to the British provinces before the acquisition of the Floridas by the treaty of
peace in 1763. One uniform rule seems to have prevailed
from their first settlement, as appears by their laws, that
friendly Indians were protected in the possession of the lands
they occupied, and were considered as owning them by a perpetual right of possession in the tribe or nation inhabiting
them, as their common property, from generation to generation, not as the right of the individuals located on particular
spots.
Subject to this right of possession, the ultimate fee was in
the crown and its grantees, which could be granted by the
VOL. iX.-4 T

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.J

crown or colonial legislatures while the lands remained In possession of the Indians, though possession could not be taken
without their consent.
Individuals could not purchase Indian lands without permission or license from the crown, colonial governors, or according to the rules prescribed by colonial laws, but such
purchases were valid with such license, or in conformity with
the local laws, and by this union of the perpetual right of occupancy with the ultimate fee, which passed from the crown
by the license, the title of the purchaser became complete.
Indian possession or occupation was considered with reference to their habits and modes of life, their hunting grounds
were as much in their actual possession as the cleared fields of
the whites, and their rights to its exclusive enjoyment in their
own way and for their own purposes were as much respected,
until they abandoned them, made a cession to the government,
or an authorized sale to individuals. In either case their right
became extinct, the lands could be granted disincumbered of
the right of occupancy, or enjoyed in fall dominion by the
purchasers from the Indians. Such was the tenure of Indian
lands by the laws of Massachusetts (Indian Laws 9, 10, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 21), in Connecticut (40, 41, 42), Rhode Island
(52, 55), New Hampshire (60), New York (62, 64, 71, 85,
102), New Jersey (133), Pennsylvania (138), Maryland (141,
143, 144, 145), Virginia (147, 148, 150, 153, 154), North
Carolina (163, 4, 58), South Carolina (178, 179), Georgia (186
187), by congress, (Appendix 16), by their respective laws,
and the decisions of courts in their construction. (See cases
collected in 2 Johnson's Dig. 15, tit. Indians, and Wharton's
Dig. tit. Land, &c. 488.) Such, too, was the view taken by
this court of Indian rights in the case of Johnson v. M'Intosh
(8 Wheat. 571, 604), which has received universal assent.
The merits of this case do not make it necessary to inquire
whether the Indians within the United States had any other
rights of soil or jurisdiction, it is enough to consider it as a'
settled principle, that their right of occupancy is considered as
sacred as the fee simple of the whites. (5 Peters 48.) The
principles which had been established in the colonies were
adopted by the king n the proclamation of October 1763, and
applied to the provinces acquired by the treaty of peace and

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

the crown lands in the royal provinces, now composing the
United States, as the law which should govern the enjoyment
and transmission of Indian and vacant lands. After providing
for the government of the acquired provinces, (1 Laws U. S.
443-444) it authorises the governors of Quebec, East and
West Florida, to make grants of such lands as the king had
power to dispose of, upon such terms as have been usual in
other colonies, and such other conditions as the crown might
deem necessary and expedient, without any other restriction.
It also authorised warrants to be issued by the governors for
military and naval services rendered in the then late war. It
reserved to the Indians the possession of their lands and hunting
grounds, and prohibited the granting any warrant of survey,
or patent for any lands west of the heads of the Atlantic
waters, or which, not having been ceded or purchased by the
crown, were reserved to the Indians, and prohibited all purchases from them without its special license. The warrants
issued pursuant to this proclamation for lands then within the
Indian boundary, before the treaty of Fort Stanwick's in 1768,
have been held to pass the title to the lands surveyed on them,
in opposition to a Pennsylvania patent afterwards issued. (Sims
v. Irvine, 3 Dallas 427-456.) And all titles held under the
charter or license of the crown to purchase from the Indians
have been held good, and such power has never been denied,
the right of the crown to grant being complete, this proclamation had the effect of a law in relation to such purchases, so
it has been considered by this court. (8 Wheat. 595-604.)
Settlements made by permission of the commanding officers of
posts on lands not ceded by the Indians, have been held to
give a pre-emption to lands in a proprietary government, and
warrants and patents for such lands have been uniformly held
good, when knowingly made by the proprietary or his officers
as lands not purchased from the Indians. (See Wharton's Dig.
tit. Lands 488.) This proclamation also directed that purchases from Indians should be made at a public council or
assembly, in the presence of the governor or commander-inchief of the colony, and be purchased for the king and in his
name. (1 Laws 447.)
The Indian deeds made at the treaty of Fort Stanwick's were
to the king in trust for the grantees. (Colony Titles 82-98.)

SUPREME COURT
rMitehel and others v. The United States.]

Grants made by the Indians at public councils have since
been made directly to the purchasers or to the state in which
the land lies, in trust for them, or with directions to convey to
them, of which there are many instances of large tracts so
sold and held, especially in New York. (Indian Treaties 1338.)
It was an universal rule that purchases made at Indian treaties,in the presence and with the approbation of the officer under
whose direction they were held by the authority of the crown,
gave a valid title to the lands, it prevailed under the laws of
the states after the revolution, and yet continues in those where
the right to the ultimate fee is owned by the states or their
grantees. It has been adopted by the United States, and purchases made at treaties held by their authority have been
always held good by the ratification of the treaty, without any
patent to the purchasers from the United States. This rule in
the colonies was founded on a settled rule of the law of England, that by his prerogative the king was the universal occupant of all vacant land in his dominions, and had the right to
grant it at his pleasure, or by his authorised officers. (Hob.
322, Co. Litt. 1, 41, b, 4 Bac. Abr., Prerog. 153, 7 Day's
Com. Dig. 76.)
The authority of the proclamation is in the right of the king
to legislate over a conquered country, which, as lord Mansfield
says, was never denied in Westminster Hall, or questioned in
parliament. If a king comes to a country by conquest, he
may alter its laws, but if he comes to it by title fnd descent,
it must be with consent of parliament. He is entrusted with
making the treaty of peace, he may yield up the conquest or
retain it on what terms he pleases. These powers no man
ever disputed, neither has it hitherto been controverted that
the king might change part or the whole of the law or political
form of government of a conquered dominion. He comes m
place of the king of Spam, the former sovereign. (Cowper 204,
213), in a case arising under this proclamation.) The proclamation of October 1763, then, must be taken to be the law
of the Floridas till their cession by Great Britain to Spain in
1783, superseding during that period the laws of Spain which
had been before in force in those provinces, so far as they were
repugnant, and according to the established principles of the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

laws of nations, the laws of a conquered or ceded country remain in force till altered by the pew sovereign. The inhabitants thereof also retain all rights not taken from them by him
in right of conquest, cession, or by new laws. It is clear then
that the Indians of Florida had a right to the enjoyment of the
lands and hunting grounds reserved and secured to them by
this proclamation, and by such tenure and on such conditions
as to alienation as it prescribed, or such as the king might
afterwards direct or authorise. The Indians had also a right
to the full enjoyment of such rights of property as the king
might choose to impart to them by any regulation, by treaty
or promise made to them by his authority.
By the treaty of Mobile in 1765 the boundary of the lands
or hunting grounds reserved and claimed by the Chickasaw
and Choctaw Indians was settled, a cession was made to the
king, reserving to themselves full right and property in all the
lands northward of such boundary. (Record 309.)
The treaty of Pensacola in the same year established the
boundary with the upper and lower Creeks, who made a cession of lands, which they granted and confirmed to the king,
(Record 310, 311) and a similar treaty was made with the
Creeks at Picolata, in east Florida, in the same year. (Record 312.)
By thus holding treaties with these Indians, accepting of
cessions from them with reservations, and establishing boundaries with them, the king waived all rights accruing by conquest or cession, and thus most solemnly acknowledged that
the Indians had rights of property which they could cede or
reserve, and that the boundaries of his territorial and propnietary rights should be such, and such only as were stipulated
by these treaties.
This brings into practical operation another principle of law
settled and declared in the case of Campbell v. Hall, that the
proclamation of 1763, which was the law of the provinces
ceded by the treaty of 1763, was binding on the king himself,
and that a right or exemption once granted by one proclamation could not be annulled by a subsequent. (Cowp. 213.) It
cannot be necessary to inquire whether rights secured by a
treaty approved by the king are less than sacred under his
voluntary proclamation.

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

By the treaty of Augusta in 1773, a cession was made to
the king of certain lands for a specified consideration, which
was to be paid to persons to whom the Cherokees and Creeks
were indebted, and to defray the expenses of the treaty. This
cession was made under an asserted claim of a right of property by the Creeks to the ceded lands, and a boundary was
established between their remaining lands and those of the
king in Georgia. (Record 3183-317.) By a subsequent
treaty at Augusta in 1783, and at Shoulderbone in 1786, the
obligation of the Indians to pay their debts is mutually recognized. (Record 317 ) By the treaty of Fort Schuyler in
1788, the obligation of the Indians to make compensation for
injuries committed by them, is also admitted, as is also the
case in treaties with the United States. (1 Laws 371, 407,
409, 410.) It may then be considered as a principle established by the king that the Indians were competent judges of
the consideration on which they granted their lands; that they
might be granted for the payment of debts, and that this principle has been fully recognized by the United States. It can
hardly be contended that while such cessions by the Creeks
were valid in Georgia on one side of a then imaginary line,
they would be void on the other side in Florida, as to lands
held under the same law and by the same tenure. Whether
the grants were made to the king directly, and the debts or
injuries which formed their consideration be paid by him to
the persons to whom they were due, or -compensation made
through him, or directly to the parties by a grant to them,
must be a matter purely in the discretion of the king, or the
officer whom he had authorised to accept or confirm the cessions by his license. Such were the relations between the
Indians and Great Britain as established by the proclamation
of 1763, and confirmed by subsequent treaties between them
'from 1765 to 1779, (Record 186, 188) during the period of her
dominion over the Flondas. This liberality and kindness to
them, with respect for their rights of property in their lands or
hunting grounds, would seem to have arisen more from a
sense of justice than motives of mere policy, when we consider
the position of Great Britain between the treaty of 1763 and
the commencement of the revolution. The undisputed sovereign of the whole territory from the Gulf of Mexico to that

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.J

of St Lawrence, she had little to fear from the rival or hostile
policy of Spain, the only neighbour to her colonies, and who
had been humbled during the preceding war, and weakened
to such a degree that she was no longer formidable in Louisiana. It was far different with Spain. On taking possession
of the Floridas, after the independence of the United States
had been established, with such a formidable, and rival, if not
hostile neighbour along the whole line of a narrow and weak
province, the friendship of the Indians was a most important
consideration. It would have been lost by adopting towards
them a less liberal, just, or kind policy than had been pursued
by Great Britain, or acting according to the laws of the Indies
in force in Mexico and Peru. It was soon found necessary
not only to respect their rights, as they had been enjoyed for
twenty years before, but to place them on the permanent foundation of treaties and direct guarantees by the king. The most
solemn assurances of both were given. (Record 232.)
A treaty was accordingly held in Pensacola in 1784 with the
Tallapoosas or Seminoles, the object of which was declared to
be to make the subjects of the king enjoy the fruits of peace,
by which the Indians acknowledge themselves his subjects,
promising to obey the laws in those points which were compatible with their character and circumstances, conforming
themselves to the usages and municipal customs which are
established (Record 320), observing their contracts with the
traders in good faith (Record 323), and promising to observe
"those orders exacted by reason, equity and justice, the principal basis of this congress." By the thirteenth article, the
officers of the crown promised in the royal name, the security
and guarantee of the lands which the Indians hold, according
to the right of property with which they possessed them, on
the sole condition that they are comprehended within the limits
of the king as the sovereign. (Record 324, 404, 405, 364.)
In 1793 another treaty was held at the Walnut Hills with the
same Indians (among others), it was declared to be a treaty of
friendship and warranty between them and the king, who was
declared their immediate protector and mediator between them
and the American states, in order to regulate their boundaries
with them, and preserve the Indians in the possession of their
lands. They were referred to the governor of West Florida, "as

[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

representing the Icing in it," by the fifth article, with a stipulation in the fifteenth, that the points negotiated would be determined on by the commissaries of the king, with the approbation of the governor of that province, with the same force as if
expressed in the treaty By the nineteenth article, the Spanish
and Indian nations approved and ratified all which was contained it, and mutually promised and swore a mutual guarantee,
the Indians declaring themselves under the protection of the
king, he assuring them of his protection in all cases where they
wanted it. (Record 240-245.) This treaty also ratified all
former treaties made from 1784. (Record 241.) They were
also approved by the king (Record 117, 118), and thereafter
considered by the highest officers of the government in Florida,
Louisiana and Cuba, as solemn guarantees to the Indians of
all the rights they held under Great Britain. (Record 139,
140, 168, 174, 181-189, 228, 229, 232-247, 257, 258, 295,
570, 583.) This right was occupancy and perpetual possession, either by cultivation, or as hunting grounds, which-was
held sacred by th6 crown, the colonies, the states and the
United States; whilethe unauthorized settlement of the whites,
on royal or proprietary lands, gave them not even the right of
pre-emption, unless by special laws, or custom and usage,
sanctioned by proprietary officers. (See Wharton's Dig. ut
supra.)
But Spain did not consider the Indian right to be that of
mere occupancy and perpetual possession, but a right of property in the lands they held under the guarantee of treaties,
which were so highly respected, that in the establishment of a
military post by a royal order, the site thereof was either
purchased from the Indians or occupied with their permission,
as that of St Mark's. The evidence of governor Folch, given
in 1827, -on the nature of the Indian title, is very strong and
full (Record 231-235), and the high respect paid to it by all
the local authorities so late as 1816, is strikingly illustrated in
a report of the surveyor-general of West Florida. It seems
that in that year an application was made for permission to buy
lands on the other side of the Bay of Pensacola, to which the
reply of the governor and sub-intendant was, if the lands are
situated on the side from Yellow Water hitherward, "I am
persuaded they belong to the Indians, even our own careemnig

[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

ground which is zn front of thzs town" (Record 172) which, according to another report from the surveyor-general, belonged
by the treaties with England, to the Indians (Record 175),
and who refers to the limited space of province left to the government, and the necessity of recurring to negotiations with
the Indians to obtain some of the lands, which are the best in
the vicinity of Pensacola. (Record 176.)
When their right is thus regarded as to their lands in the
immediate vicinity of the seat of government of the province
at so late a period, it cannot be doubted, that it was considered
by the officers of the king as at least equally valid in a far
distant part, remote from any habitation of the whites, save
those connected with the house of Panton or Forbes. Although
it may be conceded as a principle of national law, that when
Spain took possession of these provinces, the king could establish whatever form of government or system of laws he
pleased, consider by the law of power, though not of right,
the Indians as his subjects or as mere savages, with whom
there should be no relations but those of peace and trade, and
who held no rights otherwise than at the pleasure of the government, or according to the laws in force in other provinces;
yet, it was his orders to his officers to continue and confirm
those relations which had previously existed, to consider, treat
and protect the Indians as his subjects, and to give them new
and most solemn pledges of his protection in all their rights, as
individuals, and as nations or tribes, competent parties to
treaties of mutual guarantee, for his, as well as their protection
in those provinces, which had not before been done in any of
his dominions.
This was not done for slight reasons, but for such as would
seem in the opinion of all,the great officers of the provinces to
have led to these treaties, and strong stipulations, as indispensable to secure their possession. But their obligation on the
king did not depend on the motives which led to their adoption, they bound his faith, and when approved by him became
the law of the provinces, by the authority of royal orders,
which were supreme, and bound both king and Indians as
contracting parties, in this respect as nations on a footing of
equality of right and power. The consequence was, that
when once received into his protection as individuals, they
VOL. ix.-4 u

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

became entitled by the law of nations and of the provinces, on
the same footing as the other inhabitants thereof, to the benefits
of the law and government, which, in every dominion, equally
affect and protect all persons and all property within its limits,
as the rule of decision, for all questions which arise there,
(Cowper 208) as in this case it must be as to the right of property in the Indians. The situation of the Florida Indians
was well known to the United States, as is most clearly indicated in the fifth article of the treaty with Spain in 1795
CCso that Spain will not suffer her Indians to attack the citizens,
of the United States, nor the Indians inhabiting their teritory."
As thus considered by the United States and Spain, they were
called "her Indians," while those in the United States were
considered as the mere inhabitants of their territory, as the
practical result of the respective treaties which were recognized as subsisting ones between the then contracting parties
and the Indians, of the stipulations of which and their effect,
the United States could not have been otherwise than well
informed at that time, as to the right of property in Indian
lands in the Floridas. When they acquired these provinces
by the treaty of cession, it was not stipulated that any treaty
with the Indians should be annulled, or its obligation be held
less sacred than it was under Spain, nor is there the least reference to any intended change in the relations of the Indians
towards the United States. They came in the place of the
former sovereign by compact, on stipulated terms, which bound
them to respect all the existing rights of the inhabitants, of
whatever description, whom the king had recognized as being
under his protection. They could assume no right of conquest which may at any time have been vested in Great Britain or Spain, for they had been solemnly renounced, and new
relations established between them by solemn treaties, nor
did they take possession on any such assumption of right, on
the contrary, it was done under the guarantee of congress to
the inhabitants, without distinction, of their rights of property,
and with the continued assurance of protection. They might,
as the new sovereign, adopt any system of government or laws
for the territory consistent with the treaty and the constitution, but instead of doing so, all former laws and munwipal
regulations which were in existence at the cession, were con-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

tinued in force. It was not necessary for the United States,
in the treaty of cession, to enter into any new stipulation to
protect and maintain the Indians as inhabitants of Florida, in
the free enjoyment of their property, or as nations, contracting
parties to the treaties of Pensacola and Walnut Hills with
Spain in 1784 and 1793, for by the sixth article of the Louisiana treaty between France and the United States, they had
promised "to execute such articles and treaties as may have
been agreed on between Spain and the nations or tribes of Indians, until by mutual consent, other suitable articles shall have
been agreed upon." (ILaws 137.) These were the treaties
which guarantied to the Seminole Indians their lands according to the right of property with which they possessed them,
and which were adopted by the United States, who thus became the protectors of all the rights they had previously enjoyed, or could of right enjoy under Great Britain or Spain, as
individuals or nations, by any treaty to which the United
States thus became parties in 1803.
When they acquired and took possession of the Floridas,
these treaties remained in force over all the ceded territory by
the orders of the king, as the law which regulated the relations
between him and all the Indians, who were parties to them,
and were binding on the United States, by the obligation they
had assumed by the Louisiana treaty, as a supreme law of the
land which was inviolable by the power of congress. They
were also binding as the fundamental law of Indian rights,
acknowledged by royal orders and municipal regulations of the
province, as the laws and ordinances of Spain in the ceded
provinces, which were declared to continue in force by the
proclamation of the governor in taking possession of the provinces, and by the acts of congress, which assured all the inhabitants of protection in their property It would be an unwarranted construction of these treaties, laws, ordinances and
municipal regulations, were we to decide that the Indians were
not to be maintained in the enjoyment of all the rights which
they could have enjoyed under either, had the provinces reinained under the dominion of Spain. It would be rather a
perversion of their spirit, meaning and terms, contrary to the
injunction of the law under which we act, which makes the
stipulations of any treaty, the laws and ordinances of Spain,

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

and these acts of congress, so far as either apply to this case,
the standard rules for our decision.
On these consideratiois, we are clearly of opinion that the
Indians who claimed the lands in question had, under the government of Great Britain and Spain, a right of property in
them which could not be impaired without a violation of the
laws of both, and the sanctity of repeated treaties, that these
rights continued till the time of the cession, are guarantied by
the treaty and acts of congress in relation to the Floridas, in
perfect conformity with its stipulations and faith, unless the
Indians had previously made a binding transfer to the parties
under whom the petitioner claims them.
The remaining question is, whether he has become invested
with the right of the Indians, either in virtue of their deeds, or
by the grant of the lawful authorities of the king, pursuant to
the laws, usages and customs of the Spanish government of
the province. The proclamation of 1763 was undoubtedly the
law of the province till 1783, it gave direct authority to the
governors of Florida to grant crown lands subject only to such
conditions and restrictions as they or the king might prescribe.
These lands were of two descriptions such as had been ceded
to the king by the Indians, in which he had full property and
dominion, and passed in full property to the grantee, and those
reserved and secured to the Indians, in which their right was
perpetual possession, and his the ultimate reversion in fee,
which passed by the grant subject to the possessory right. The
proclamation also authorized the union of these rights by a
purchase from the Indians, and taking possession with the
leave and license of the crown in favour of an individual, or by
the governor at an Indian council, for and in the name of the
king. This proclamation was also the law of all the North
American colonies in relation to crown lands. The grants of
the governors were universally considered as made by the king

through his authorized representatives, and when his authority
to grant those lands of the crown, the right to which was perfect by the union of the rights of possession with the reversion,
it is scarcely possible that their authority would be more limited as to those in which the king had only a remote ultimate
fee. As a matter of policy, it was for the benefit of the kingand colony to substitute the possession, settlement and culti-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

vation of the whites for the mere occupancy of the Indians in
the pursuit of game, and it cannot be imagined, without clear
proof, that the autograph of the king, or his order in council,
should be indispensable for a license or permission to purchase,
when a patent was valid without either. There is no evidence
in the record or in the history of the colonies that such a distinction existed in law or usage, but is in direct collision with
all the colonial laws relating to purchases from the Indians, as
well as the course pursued at treaties, when deeds were made
to purchasers with the consent of the governor, or to the king,
state, or United States, for their use, or in trust to convey to
them. There is no evidence or reason to induce the belief that
Spain acted in any other manner in the confirmation of Indian
deeds, the usage of her local governors and commandants of
posts in such confirmation, is in precise conformity to that of
the other colonial officers under Great Britain, and was also in
conformity to the existing laws of Spain. (Record 329.) From
the confirmation of the Houma grant in 1777 by the governorgeneral of Louisiana to that of the captain-general of Cuba of
this, in 1811, during forty years, no instance appears of a direct
confirmation by the king, or of his ever having required any
other act than the approbation of the local governor to give
perfect validity to the purchase.
Independently of these considerations there is another,
founded on the treaty at the Walnut Hills, with the Creek and
Tallapoosa Indians, held by the then governor of West Florida,
under the authority of the governor-generalof Louisiana. The
governor of that province is in the fifth article declared to be
"as representing the king in it." Such a stipulation in a treaty
of friendship and warranty would bind the king in good faith
not to disavow his acts declared to be done in the royal name
and authority It would be an imputation on his faith to his
acknowledged subjects, plighted by repeated guarantees, to
suppose that he intended by the treaty of cession to exclude
from confirmation, those lands which his white subjects had
purchased from the Indians under the sanction of treaties, with
the approbation and formal confirmation of his highest officers,
and to confirm only those grants of the royal domain, which
had been made at the mere will of his governors, for such consideration only as they might prescribe. If there could be any

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

foundation for such an imputation in any case, the history,
terms and consideration for the present grants would at once
repel it, and whenwe consider, that the United States accepted
of the cession with a knowledge that they had been made, as
well as the circumstances under which they were made,
connected with the quantity of land embraced within them,
without excepting them from confirmation, we can have little
doubt that it was the meaning and intention of both contracting parties to the treaty, to place them on the same footing as
the grants of lands belonging to the royal domain.
There is nothing in the treaty which authorizes a distinction
between such grants, which operate by their own force as a
transfer of the full property in royal lands, held by the crown
under cessions from the Indians, or deeds of confirmation,
which give validity to grants conveying the Indian right, in
confirming the transfer by the license of the king in the person
of his representative.
The governor was equally the lawful authority of the king
for the one purpose as the other . though he had, by his royal
order, transferred the power to grant royal lands, from the governor to the intendant, he had not affected the authority of
the former, to confirm grants made by the Indians in such form
as to validate the title conveyed. Whether this act of the
governor operated by way of confirmation or grant is immaterial, it gave such effect to the purchase, that the lands
became the property of the purchaser, so that they could not
revert to the crown by the abandonment of the Indians, or any
judicial process known to the law of England or Spain, which
in substance and effect were the same. When we look, too,
to the very remote contingent interest which the king could
have to these lands, consistently with his guarantee to the Indians, there can be no reason perceived why deeds or grants,
operating to confirm in full property to the purchasers from the
Indians, lands thus guarantied to them, should not be held in
a court of equity as valid as original grants of the royal domain.
The Indian right to the lands as property, was not merely
of possession, that of alienation was concomitant, both were
equally secured, protected, and guarantied by Great Britain
and Spain, subject only to ratification and confirmation by the
license, charter, or deed from the governor representing the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

king. Such purchases enabled the Indians to pay their debts,
compensate for their depredations on the traders resident among
them, to provide for their wants; while they were available to
the purchasers as payment of the considerations which at their
expense had been received by the Indians. It would have
been a violation of the faith of the government to both, to encourage traders to settle in the province, to put themselves and
property in the power of the Indians, to suffer the latter to contract debts, and when willing to pay them by the only means
in their power, a cession of their lands, withhold an assent to
the purchase, which by their laws or municipal regulations
was necessary to vest a title. Such a. course was never
adopted by Great Britain in any of her colonies, nor by Spain
in Louisiana or Florida of this fact there is abundant proof
in the record, by public documents, and the testimony of the
highest officers of the local government, the laws, usages and
customs of which were well known to the United States before
the treaty. The report of the commissioners on Opelousas
dlaims was submitted to the secretary of the treasury in 1815,
acted on and approved by congress in 1816, in which report
the commissioners state "that the right of the Indians to sell
their land was always recognised by the Spanish government.
(Record 328.) The laws made it necessary when the Indians
sold their lands to have the deeds presented to the governor
for confirmation. (Record 329.) The sales by the Indians
transferred the kind of right which they possessed, the ratification of the sale by the governor must be regarded as a relinquishment of the title of the crown to the purchaser (Record 333), and no instance is known where permission to sell
has been "refused (Record 330), or the rejection of an Indian sale" (Record 336).
In the present case the Indian sale has been confirmed with
more than usual solemnity and publicity, it has been done at
a public council and convention of the Indians conformably
to treaties, to which the king was a party, and which the
United States adopted, and the grant was known to both parties to the treaty of cession. The United States were not deceived by the purchase, which they knew was subject to the
claim of the petitioner, or those from whom he purchased, and
made no stipulation which should put it to a severer test than

SUPREME COURT.
[Mitchel and others v. The United States.]

any other, and it was made to a house which, in consideration of its great and continued services to the king and his
predecessor, had deservedly given them high claims as well
on his justice as his faith. But if there could be a doubt that
the evidence in the record did not establish the fact of a royal
license or assent to this purchase as a matter of specific and
judicial belief, it would be presumed as a matter of law arising
from the facts and circumstances of the case, which are admitted or unquestioned.
As heretofore decided by this court, the law presumes the
existence in the provinces of an officer authorized to make
valid grants (6 Peters 728, 8 Peters 459), a fortiori, to give
license to purchase and to confirm, and the treaty designates
the governor of West Florida as the proper officer to make
grants of Indian lands by confirmation as plainly as it does
the governor of East Florida to make original grants (8
Peters 452), or the intendant of West Florida to grant royal
lands. A direct grant from the crown of lands in a royal
haven may be presumed on an uninterrupted possession of
sixty years (2 Anst. 614, 1 Dow. Par. Ca. 322, 323), or a
prescriptive possession of crown lands for forty years (3 Dow
Par. Ca. 112). An encroachment on a royal forest by a continued possession of twenty years will be presumed to have
been by the license of the crown or by a grant, if no act of
parliament prohibits it. (11 East 57, 284, 488, 495.) On the
same principle, after a long possession of Indian lands the law
would presume that it was founded on an Indian deed duly
confirmed, or any title consistent with the facts and circumstances in evidence. (1 Paine 469, 470.) Any thing which
would make the ancient appropriation good (Cowper 110), if
it could have had a lawful foundation, for whatever may commence by grant is good by prescription. (1 Roll. Ab. 512, 4
Mod. 55, 1 Saund. 345.) The length of time which brings a
given case within the legal presumption of a grant, charter, or
license, to validate a right long enjoyed, is not definite, depending on its peculiar circumstances, in this case we think
it might be presumed in less time than when the party rested
his claim on prescriptive possession alone. There is every evidence, short of the sign manual or order of the king, approving
and confirming this grant, and if that were wanting to secure

JANUARY TERM 1835.

I
a right of property to lands which have been held as these
have been, the law would presume that it once existed, but
was lost in the lapse of time and change of governments.
The more especially as by the laws of Spain prescription for
the period of ten years has the same effect as twenty by the
principles of the common law
For these reasons we think the title of the petitioner is valid
by all the rules prescribed by the acts of congress, which give
usjurisdiction of the case.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the superior court for the middle district of Florida,
and was argued by counsel on full consideration whereof,
this court is unanimously of opinion, that the title of the petitioner to so much of the lands in controversy as is embraced
within the lines and boundaries of the tract granted by the
deeds, grants and acts of confirmation to Panton, Leslie &
Co. in 1804 and 1806, also to the island in the river Appalachicola, ceded, granted and confirmed to John Forbes in 1811,
also to the lands and islands at and west of the mouth of said
river, which were ceded, granted and confirmed to John Forbes
& Co. in 1811, is valid by the law of nations, the treaty between the United States and Spain, by which the territory of
the Floridas was ceded to the former; the laws and ordinances
of Spain, under whose government the title originated, the
proceedings under said treaty, and the acts of congress relating
thereto and do finally order, decree, determine and adjudge
accordingly. And this court doth in like manner order,
adjudge, determine and decree, that the title of the petitioner to so much of the tract of land which lies east of the
first mentioned tract, between the rivers Wakulla and St
Mark's, which was conveyed to John Forbes & Co. in 1811,
as shall not be included in the exception hereinafter made, is
valid by the laws, treaty, and proceedings as aforesaid, with the
exception of so much of the last mentioned tract as includes
the fortress of St Marks and the territory directly and immediately adjacent and appurtenant thereto, which are hereby
reserved for the use of the United States. And it is further
ordered and decreed, that the territory thus described shall be

SUPREME COURT.
[Alitchel and others v. The United States.]

that which was ceded by the Indian proprietors to the crown
of Spain for the purpose of erecting the said fort, provided the
boundaries of the said cession can be ascertained. If the
boundaries of the said cession cannot now be ascertained, then
the adjacent lands which were considered and held by the
- Spanish government or the commandant of the post as annexed
to the fortress for military purposes, shall be still considered as
annexed to it, and reserved with it for the use of the United
States. If no evidence can now be obtained to designate the
extent of the adjacent lands, which were considered as annexed
o to St Mark's as aforesaid, then so much land shall be comprehended in this exception as, according to the military usage,
was generally attached to forts in Florida or the adjacent colonies. If no such military usage can be proved, then it is
ordered and decreed that a line shall be extended from the
point of junction between the rivers St Mark's and Wakulla to
the middle of the river St Mark's, below the junction, thence
extending up the middle of each river three miles in a direct
line, without computing the courses thereof, and that the
territory comprehended within a direct line, to be run so as to
connect the points of termination on each aver, at the end of
the said three miles up each river, and the two lines to be run
as aforesaid, shall be, and the same is hereby declared to be,
the territory reserved as adjacent and appurtenant to the fortress
of St Mark's, and as such reserved for the use of the United
States. To which the claim of the petitioner is rejected, and
as to which this court decree that the same is a part of the
public lands of the United States.
The decree of the court below is, therefore, reversed and
annulled in all matters and things therein contained, with the
exception aforesaid, and this court, proceeding to render such
decree as the said court ought to have rendered, do order, adjudge and decree, that the claim of the petitioner is valid and
ought to be confirmed, and is and remains confirmed by the
treaty, laws and proceedings aforesaid, to all the lands embraced therein, except such part as is- herein above excepted.
And this court does further order, adjudge and decree, that the
