LIADI PATTERSON.
Georgia. Ejectment for a tract of land in Franklin county, Georgia, held
under a grant to Basil Jones, and conveyed by the attorney of Basil Jones to
the defendant in error. See 11 Wheat. 380,5 Peters 233. A copy of the grant
was produced in evidence, and a copy of a power of attorney, dated 6th of
August 1793, to Thomas Smith, authorizing him to sell the land, executed
in the presence of Abram Jones, J. P. and Thomas Harwood. This copy was
certified from the records of Richmond county, Georgia, and recorded
Ilth of July 1795. The original power ofattorney was lost, and evidence of
the loss, to introduce the copy, was given.
What evidence is sufficient to introduce secondary proof.
The deputy clerk of the Richmond county court, who, as such, had recorded
the original power of attorney, swore that he was well acquainted with
Abram Jones, esquire, and his hand writing, during the year 1793, &c.
That the record of the power of attorney from B. Jones to T. Smith, made
by himself, while clerk of the court, is a copy of an original power of attorney, which he believes to have been genuine, for that the official signature of Abram Jones, must have induced him, to commit the same to record,
and that the copy of that said power of attorney, the one offered in evidenee, had been compared with the record of the original made by himself,
and is a true copy. Upon this evidence, the plaintiff offered the copy in
evidence, and it was admitted by the circuit court. Held, that there was no
error in admitting this evidence.
At the time of the admission of this evidence, it was forty years old. Abram
Jones, the subscribing witness to the original, was long since dead, and it
did not appear that the other witness was alive. The original power did
not exist, so that no evidence of the hand writing of the other witness could
be given. After the lapse of thirty years from the execution of a deed, the
witnesses are presumed to be dead, and this is the common ground for dispensing with the production of them, without any search for them, or proof
of their death, when the original deed is before the court for proof. This
rule applies not only to grants of land, but to all other deeds where the instrument comes from the custody ofthe proper party claiming under it, or
entitled to its custody.
The case of Patterson v. Winn, 5 Peters 233, 244, cited.
The rule is admitted that a copy of a copy is not evidence. This rule properly applies to cases where the copy is taken from a copy, the original
being still in existence, and capable of being compared with it, for then it
is a second remove from the original, or wheli it is a copy of a copy of a
record, the record being in existence, and deemed by law as high evidence
as the original, for then it is also a second remove from the original. But,
it is a quite different question whether it applies to cases of secondary evidence where the original is lost, and the record of it is not deemed in law
as hi gh as the original, or when the copy of a copy is the highest proof in
existence. (In this case, the power of attorney was recorded in Richmond

SUPREME COURT.
[Winn and othersy. Patterson.]
county, and the land in controversy was in Franklin county.) Held, that
this is not the case of a mere copy of a copy verified as such, but it is the
case of a second copy verified as a true copy of the original.
If a certified copy of a duly recorded deed is evidence, it is not necessary to
produce the original book in which the same was recorded.
Therer are cases when grants and securities made contrary to the prohibitions
of a statute, in part, are, upon the true construction of the intent of the statute, void in toto. But it is very different in cases standing merely on the
common law. And, therefore, at the common law, in order to make a grant
void, in toto, for fraud or covin, the fraud or covin must infect the whole
transaction, or be so mixed up in it as not to be capable of a distinct and
separate consideration.
A grant may be good for part of the land granted, and bad as to other parts of
the same.
The case of Patterson v. Jenks,.2 Peters 216, 235, cited.

IN error to the circuit court of the United States for the district of Georgia.
In February 1820, an action of ejectment was instituted in
the circuit court, by the lessee of William Patterson against
Elisha Winn and others, to recover a tract of land in the county
of Franklin, in the state of Georgia. The case has been
twice before this court on a writ of error. 11 Wheat 380, 6
Cond. Rep. 355, and 8 Peters 233. Many of the material
facts in the case will be found in the reports referred to.
At November term 1833, of the circuit court, in pursuance
of the mandate of this court, a new trial of the case took place,
and the plaintiff gave in evidence a grant from the state of
Georgia to Basil Jones for 7800 acres of land, including the
lands in controversy in this suit, dated 24th May 1787, with
a plot of the survey of the said land annexed, a copy of
a power of attorney from Basil Jones to Thomas Smith, Jun.,
purporting to be dated the 6th of August 1793, authorizing
Smith, inter alia, to sell and convey the tract of 7800 acres,
which power purported to be signed and sealed in the presence
of Abraham Jones, J. P and Thomas Harwood, Jun., and
the copy was certified to be a true copy from the records of
Richmond county, Georgia, and recorded there on the 11th
July 1795, and to account for the loss of the-original power of
attorney of which the copy was offered, and of the use of due
diligence and search for the same, the plaintiff read the depositions of William Patterson and others, the particulars of
which, and all the evidence in the case, are stated in the bill
of exceptions. The defendant objected to the evidence, and

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Wina and others v. Patterson.]

the court overruled the objection, and allowed the paper to be
read to the jury. To this decision of the court the defendant
excepted, and the court sealed a bill of exceptions. In the
further progress of the case further evidence was offered, and
certain instructions thereon asked of the court, which were
refused, and the refusal of the court to give such instructions
was the subject of another exception.
The jury, under the charge of the court, found a verdict for
the plaintiff, upon which judgment was entered, and the defendants prosecuted this writ of error.
The bills of exceptions were as follow.
The plaintiff, to maintain the issue on his part, gave in evidence a copy of a grant from the state of Georgia to Basil
Jones, for seven thousand three hundred acres, bearing date on
the 24th day of May 1787, together with a plat of survey of
the said land thereto annexed (a copy of which plat and grant
was in the record); and further offered to give in evidence
to the jury a paper writing, .purporting to be a copy of a
power of attorney from Basil Jones to Thomas Smyth, Junior,
executed on the 6th day of August 1793, by Basil Jones, in
the presence of Abram Jones, J. P and Thomas Harwood,
on which copy there was a certificate under the official seal,
of John H. Mann, clerk of the superior court of Richmond county, stating that it was a true copy from the record
in his office, entered on book, &c., on the 11th July 1795. A
certificate from John H. Montgomery, one of the judges of the
superior court, was annexed, stating that the officer who cerutified the copy, was the clerk of the superior court, that his
signature was entitled to full faith and credit, and that the attestation was in due form. The power of attorney authorized
Thomas Smyth, Junior, to sell and dispose of seven thousand
three hundred acres of land granted to Basil Jones, part of
which is the land for which this ejectment was brought.
To account for the loss of the original power of attorney,
the plaintiff below produced his affidavit, stating his belief that
the said original grant to BasilJones had been lost or destroyed
-this affidavit was made on the 23d of July 1833, also the
deposition of Andrew Fleming, stating numerous and particular acts which he had performed to discover the said origiVOL. ix.-4 I

SUPREME COURT.
[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

nals. This deposition set forth diligent examinations for the
lost papers in various places, and by inquiries of all such persons where and with whom the said papers might probably
have been found, if they had not been altogether lost or destroyed.
Also the answers to interrogatories of Anna Maria Smyth,
the widow of Thomas Smyth, relative to the lost papers, and
stating that she had not been able to find them, among the
papers of her deceased husband, nor had she ever seen them,
although she had the custody of all the papers left by her deceased husband.
And further to account for the loss of the said original
power, Richard H. Wilde, Esq. was examined on interrogatories propounded to him, who stated that he had made diligent
search for the said power of attorney, with the assistance of
the clerk in the clerk's office of the superior court of Richmond county, without success. That he had applied to the
widow of Basil Jones for the paper and for the original grant,
who was unable to find the same, and had advertised for the
same for some months, in two newspapers in Georgia he had
inquired for the, same at the office of the secretary of state at
Milledgeville, and had searched the clerk's office at Columbia,
where Basil Jones formerly resided, and also had made numerous other searches and inquiries. A copy of the advertisement for the lost papers was inserted in the examinaton.
The testimony of John H. Wilde, Esq. was also introduced,
who proved, that by reputation Abram Jones was dead long
since, that he compared the copy of the power of attorney
offered in evidence with the record in the clerk's office of Richmond superior court, and it is a true copy William Patterson,
the plaintiff in the circuit court, he believed had never been in
Georgia.
William Robertson deposed, that he was deputy clerk and
acted as such, of Richmond county, in the year 1794, and
clerk of the said court in 1795, and continued in that office
till 1808 or 1809; that he was well acquainted with Abram
Jones, Esq. and his handwriting, during the years 1793,
1794 and 1795, and before and afterwards. The deponent
further states that the record of a power of attorney from B.
Jones to Thomas Smyth, Junior, made by himself while clerk

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Winn and others v. Patterson]

of that court, is a copy of an original power of attorney which
he believes to have been genuine, for that the official signature
of Abram Jones must have induced him to commit the same to
record, and that the copy of said power of attorney transmitted with deponent's depositions has been compared by himself
with the record of the original made by himself in Richmond
county, and is a true copy.
The plaintiff then offered the paper purporting to be a copy
of the power of attorney in evidence; which was opposed by the
counsel for the defendants, as not admissible evidence.
The counsel for the lessor of the plaintiff, further to prove
the original power of attorney was made and executed, gave
in evidence a deed executed byThomas Smyth, Junior, alleging
himself to be the attorney in fact of Basil Jones, dated 18th
November 1793, which conveyed to William Patterson, the
lessor of the plaintiff, seven thousand three hundred acres of
land in Franklin county, originally granted to Basil Jones, May
24th 1787, which deed also conveyed, or purported to convey,
four other tracts of land situate in Franklin county, and contained the following recital "whereas, the said Basil Jones,
by a certain writing or letter of attorney, dated the 6th day
of August last past, did empower and authorize the said attorney, (Thomas Smyth, Jumor) in his, the said Basil Jones, name,
to sell and dispose of five certain tracts or parcels of land
hereinafter mentioned, situate in Franklin county, and state
of Georgia aforesaid." And the plaintiff offered in evidence
proof that Abram Jones, who signed the original power of
attorney, was, at the time he signed the same, a justice of
the peace, of the county of Richmond, which was admitted by
the defendants' counsel.
The plaintiff's counsel then insisted that the copy of the
power of attorney was admissible in evidence, and should go
to the jury, which was opposed by the defendants' counsel,
but the court admitted the same, and the counsel for the defendants excepted to the said admission.
The plaintiff also offered three W~itnesses before the jury to
prove the identity of the land in dispute, with a plat of the same
given in evidence, and that the defendants were in possession
of the part for which this suit was brought, and also the
location of the land, which witnesses also proved that part of

SUPREME COURT.
[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

the said land, which lay on the south and west of the said
Appalachee river, was not, at the time of issuing the said
grant, situate m the county of Franklin, as the grant purported
it to be, but was without the then county of Franklin, and
beyond the then temporary boundary line of the state of Georgia. Whereupon the attorney for the said defendants prayed
the said justices to instruct the said jury, that if the jury believed that Basil Jones, the deputy surveyor and grantee, under
whom the lessor of the plaintiff claims, by designating the
stream marked in the original plat as "the branch of the south
fork of the Oconee river, instead of the south fork of the Oconee river, and by stating that the land was situate in the
county of Franklin, when a large part of it lay without the
county of Franklin, and without the temporary boundary line
of the state of Georgia, practised a deception upon the governor
of the state, and thereby induced him to to issue the grant,
that such grant is fraudulent and void, and cannot entitle the
plaintiff.to recover;" which instruction the said justices refused
to give to the said jurors. And the said attorney further prayed
the said court to instruct the said jurors, that a grant of land
is an entirety, and that a grant void in part is void for the
whole; which instruction the said justicesalso refused togive to
the said jurors. And they further prayed the said court to instruct the said jurors, that a concealment or misrepresentation
of material facts, calculated to deceive the governor issuing
the grant, renders the grant null and void in law, which instruction the said justices also refused to give to the said jurors,
and the jurors gave their verdict against the said defendants,
upon the issue aforesaid.
The -case was argued by Mr Seaborn Jones, for the plaintiffs,
and by Mr Wilde and Mr Berrien, for the defendant.
Mr Jones contended, that the circuit court erred
1. In permitting the defendant in error to read in evidence
to the jury, a paper purporting to be a copy of a power of attorney from Basil Jones to Thomas Smyth, Junior, for want of
sufficient legal proof of the genuineness, existence and execution of the original, or of the correctness of said paper, offered
as a copy.

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

2. In permitting the defendant in error to read in evidence
to the jury a copy of a grant to Basil Jones, which grant, and
the survey on which it was founded, were contrary to the laws
of Georgia, and therefore null and void.
3. In refusing to instruct the jury that the said grant and
the survey on which it was founded, were contrary to the laws
of Georgia, and.were therefore null and void.
To show that the writing was not admissible in evidence,
until the absence of all the witnesses was accounted for, he
cited, 1 Starkie's Ev. 340, 342, 345, 5 Cranch 13, 18 Johns.
Rep. 60, 2 Serg. and Rawle 44, 1 Overton 187, 1 Dallas's
Rep. 123, Peake's Ev. 146, 152.
There had been no possession to warrant the admission of
the copy of the power of attorney, as an ancient deed. The
rule requires thirty years possession under the deed. No actual
possession of the land has been shown, and constructive possession will not do. No possession can be based upon a presumption. Possession or constructive possession cannot be
presumed, and then from that, the execution of the deed be
presumed. The actual accompanying possession is what gives
credit to the presumption of the execution of a deed. Cited,
3 Johns. 295, 10 Johns. 475, 9 Johns. 169, Buller's Nisi
Prius 254.
But the rule which admits ancient deeds, does not apply to
a copy Peake's Ev 162, 141, 167. There must be proof of
the due execution of the original. I Starkie's Ev. 154, 1
Johns. Cases 402, 409.
The record of the recording an instrument, is no evidence,
unless the deed was recorded by due authority. I Atk. 264,
6 Binn. 274, 1 Marsh. Rep. 205.
The deed was not recorded in the proper county, as no part
of the land lay in the county where the deed was recorded.
There is no law of Georgia which authorises the recording of
powers of attorney, but the courts have considered powers of
attorney as standing on the same footing as deeds.
The enrolment of a deed is no evidence of the contents of a
deed unless made by the authority of law. Cited, 1 Starkie's
Ev. 365, note, Buller~s Nist Prius 255, 1 Har. and John. 527,
1 Taylor's Rep. 25, 2 Wash. Rep. 280, 1 Peters 98.
The evidence offered, was but a copy of a copy. As to copies

of records being evidence: cited, 1 Philips's Ev. 291, 309, 292,
3 Day's Rep. 399, Peake's Ev. 58, 3 Dall. 65, 4 Munf.
310.
There was no evidence, whatever, of the absence of the
witnesses to the power of attorney. Cited, 5 Peters 242.
The grant to Basil Jones was absolutely void, having been
obtained by practising a fraud on the government of Georgia.
The evidence of the fraud should have been admitted. Cited,
1 Wheat. 115, 155, Indian Treaty of 1783, and act of the
legislature of Georgia of 1784, act of 1780, Patterson v. Winn,
11 Wheat. 380, 6 Cond. Rep. 355.
There has been a legislative construction of the treaty of
1784, showing what the boundary line was. This is referred
to for the purpose of showing that the grant was void in part,
the part of the land being within the Indian lines, and was,
therefore, void altogether.
To show that all grants of land within the Indian boundary
were absolutely void, and that the surveys under such grants
were void cited, Prince's Dig. of the Laws of Georgia 268,
275, 278, 304, 363, Walker's Dig. 363, Polk's Lessee v
Wendall, 9 Cranch 99, 3 Cond. Rep. 286.
It is not intended to say, that the legislature could declare
a patent for lands void, if granted for lands within the state, and
which were subject to grants. The law declares, the patent
for land so situated shall not be given in evidence. The
legislature have declared all grants within the Indian boundary void. Prince's Dig. 268, 276. Basil Jones was but a
deputy surveyor, and had no authority to make the survey
The evidence shows he acted fraudulently, as he well knew
the actual boundary of the Indian territory, and knowingly
violated the laws of Georgia, forbidding surveys, of lands not
subject to grant. He acted in violation of his official oath.
A deed which is void in part, is altogether void. 14 Johns.
458. This point was not decided by the court in the case of
Patterson v. Jenks, nor was the question of the admissibility
of the power of attorney decided in that case.
Mr Jones laid before the court certificates from the judges of
the courts of Georgia, and opinions of the judges of those
courts as to the construction of the registry acts of that state,

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[(Winn and others v. Patterson.]

which certificates, he contended, sustained the views he bad
presented, of those laws.
Mr Wilde and Mr Berrien, for the defendant in error, argued, that there was but one point in this case open for argument, as all the other questions had been decided by the court
in the former cases. The defendants in the court below are
shown bv the record to have all resided within the limits of the
county of Franklin, and all the lands in controversy in this suit
are within that county.
The only point in the case is, therefore, that which relates
to the admissibility of the power of attorney to support the
deed from Basil Jones. Did the court err in allowing this evidence to go to the jury '
The rules of law on this question relate either 1. To the
proof of the execution of the original instrument. 2. To the
proof necessary to dispense with the production of an original.
3. To the degree of secondary proof which is necessary when
the production of the original is dispensed with. As the evidence in this case was not the original power, the question is,
whether evidence sufficient to authorize the introduction of the
copy was given. It is contended, that this proof was given in
the evidence of the clerk who recorded the power, and which
is set forth at large in the bill of exceptions.
A copy may be verified by an officer duly authorized for that
purpose, or by the oath of an individual who has compared it
with the record authorized by law, and therefore as the evidence of a private individual, not an officer, the testimony of
the person who made the copy was sufficient.
It is not a copy of a copy. The witness was in possession
of the original, and from that made the copy in the record, and
he swears that the copy is a genuine copy of the original.
The evidence is, that the copy on the record, and the copy
offered in evidence, were both genuine copies of the original.
The counsel then went into a particular examination of the
evidence, and contended, that it fully sustained the right of
the plaintiff below, on every principle of law, to give the copy

of the power of attorney in evidence. The strictest rules of law
were complied with. 1 Stark. Ev. 341, 343.

SUPREME COURT
tWinn and others v. Patterson.]

The handwriting of the other witness to the power of attorney could not have been proved, as the original was lost.
Thirty years had elapsed since the execution of the power
and of the deed made under it, and this authorises the presumption of the due execution of the instrument. Possession
must accompany the deed, but an actual pedis possessio is not
required, and this rule is not applicable to a power of attorney.
In this case, the possession was in accordance with the
deed, and there was no evidence given to show that the defendants were other than mere intruders. Cited, 8 Cranch
229, 4 Wheat. 222, 5 Peters 489. Evidence of loss of papers,
and secondary proof of their contents is addressed to the court.
6 Johns. 195. In Georgia, if proof of loss of an originial
paper is given by the death of the party, a copy will be admitted or proof of its contents. Cited, 5 Peters 242, 2 Serg. and
Rawle 44, 4 Bos. and Pull. 260, 2 Peters 250, 3 Hayward
96, 123.
If the original power of attorney were before this court, the
acknowledgement of it before a justice of the peace, would, by
the law of Georgia of 1785, make it, per se, evidence.
Mr Justice SToRY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a writ of error to the circuit court of the district of
Georgia. The cause, which is an ejectment, has been twice
before this court, and the decisions then had, will be found
reported in 11 Wheat. Rep. 380, and 5 Peters's Rep. 233, to
which we may therefore refer, as containing a statement of
many of the material facts.
At the new trial had in November term 1833, in pursuance
of the mandate of this court. The plaintiff, to maintain the issue
on his part, gave in evidence a copy of a grant from the state
of Georgia to Basil Jones, for seven thousand three hundred
acres, including the lands in controversy, dated the 24th of
May 1787, with a plat of survey thereto annexed. He then
offered a copy of a power of attorney from Basil Jones to
Thomas Smy th, Junior, purporting tobe dated the 6th of August
1793, and to authorize Smyth, among other things, to sell and
convey the tract of seven thousand three hundred acres, so
granted, which power purported to be signed and sealed in the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

presence of "Abram Jones, J. P., and Thomas Harwood,
Jun. ;" and the copy was certified to be a true copy from the
records of Richmond county, Georgia, and recorded therein, on
the 11th day of July 1795. And to account for the loss of the
original power of attorney, of which the copy was offered, and
of the use of due diligence and search to find the same, the
plaintiff read the affidavit of William Patterson, the lessor of
the plaintiff, which in substance stated, that he badnot in his
possession, power or custody, the original grant, and that he
verily believed the original power of attorney and grant have
been lost or destroyed. He also read, for the same purpose,
the deposition of Andrew Fleming, which stated in substance,
the searches made by him among Thomas Smyth's papers, and
the information received by him, leading to the conclusion,
that the same has been lost or destroyed. Also, the deposition of Mrs Smyth, the widow of Thomas Smyth, for the same
purpose. Also, the deposition of Richard H. Wilde, which
stated several searches made by him for the original power, in
the office of the clerk of Richmond county, and m other places,
and an application to the wife of Basil Jones, and to the son of
Thomas Smyth, for the like purpose, and an advertisement in
two Georgia newspapers, for information respecting the same,
all of which proved ineffectual.
The same witness also
stated, that Abram Jones, the supposed subscribing witness,
was, by public reputation, long since dead. It was admitted
that Abram Jones was, at the time of the supposed execution
of the power, a justice of the peace.
The plaintiff also read in evidence the deposition of William
Robertson, who stated that he was deputy clerk of the court
of Richmond county in 1794, and clerk in 1795, and continued in office until 1808 or 1809; that he was well acquainted
with Abram Jones, and his handwriting, during the years
1793, 1794 and 1795, and before and afterwards. That the
record of the power of attorney from B. Jones to Thomas
Smyth, Jun., made by himself while clerk of the court, is a
copy of an original power of attorney, which he believes to
have been genuine, for that the official signature of Abram
Jones must have induced him to commit the same to record,
and that the copy of the said power of attorney transmitted
with the deponent's depositions (the copy before the court),
VOL. IX.-4 K

674

SUPREME COURT.
[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

had been compared with the record of the original made by
himself in Richmond county, and is a true copy
The plaintiff also gave in evidence a deed executed by Thomas Smyth, Jun., as attorney in fact of Basil Jones, dated on
the 18th of November 1793,,conveying, as such attorney, to
William Patterson, the lessor of the plaintiff, certain tracts of
land, and among others, the tract of seven thousand three
hundred acres; which deed contained a recital that Basil Jones,
by his certain writing or letter of attorney, dated the 6th of
August 1793, did empower and authorise his said attorney in
his, Basil Jones, name, to sell and dispose of the tracts mentioned in the deed, which deed was recorded in the records of
Franklin county, on the 25th of July 1795.
Upon this evidence the plaintiff offered the copy as evidence
in the cause. It was objected to by the defendants, and the
objection was overruled by the court, and the copy was admitted in evidence to the jury. And this ruling of the court
constitutes the first ground in the bill of exceptions, upon
which the defendants now rely for a reversal of the judgment
of the circuit court, which was in favour of the plaintiff.
In the consideration of the admissibility of the copy, two
questions are involved. In the first place, whether there was
sufficient evidence of the genuineness and due execution of
the original power of attorney. In the next place, if its genuineness and due execution are established, whether the copy

was, by the principles of law under all the circumstances, admissible proof.
In regard to the first question, we are to consider, that the
original instrument (supposing it to be genuine) is of an ancient date, having been executed in the year 1793, and recorded in the public records as a genuine instrument in 1795, so
that at the time of the trial, it was forty years of age. Abram
Jones, one of the subscribing witnesses, was long since dead,
and it does not appear that Thomas Harwood, the other subscribing witness, was alive, or that the plaintiff had any means of
identifying him or tracing out his residence. The original power
did not exist, so that the plaintiff could not, by an inspection
of his handwriting, ascertain who he was, or where he lived.
After the lapse of thirty years from the time of the execution
of a deed, the witnesses are presumed to be dead, and this is

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

the common ground, in such cases, for dispensing with theproduction of them, without any search for them, or proof of
their death, when the original deed is before the court for
proof. It is a rule adopted for common convenience, and
founded upon the great difficulty of proving the due execution
of a deed after an interval of many years. And the rule applies not only to grants of land, but to all other deeds, where
the instrument comes from the custody of the proper party
claiming under it, or entitled to its custody. 1 Phillips on
Evidence, ch. 8, sect. 2, p. 406, and cases there cited, I Starkie
on Evidence, part 2, sect. 143, 144, 145, and cases there cited.
If, therefore, the original power were now produced from the
custody of the plaintiff, it would not be necessary to establish
its due execution by the production of the subscribing witnesses. It would be sufficient to establish it by other proofs.
This view of the matter disposes of that part of the argument which denies that the proof of the original instrument
can be made without the production of the subscribing witness, Harwood, or accounting for his non production.
Then what is the proof of the genuineness and due execution of the original power of attorneyq Mr Robertson swears
that he was acquainted with the handwriting of Abram Jones
(one of the subscribing witnesses), at the time of its date, as
well as before, and afterwards; that he recorded it in the
county records, that the record is a copy of an original power
of attorney, which he believed to have been genuine, for that
the official signature of Abram Jones must have induced hin
to commit the same to record. Now, What is to be understood by the "official signature" in the language of the witness 1 Clearly, his genuine handwriting, and the annexation of
his official title, J. P., that is, Justice of the Peace, establishing
that he verifies the instrument, not merely as an individual,
but as a public officer. It is impossible that it could be his
official signature, unless it was also a genuine, and not forged
signature of his name. So that here we have from Mr Robertson, direct proof of his belief of the genuineness of the signature of a subscribing witness, from his knowledge of his
handwriting, his examination of the original instrument, and
his having recorded it upon the faith of such belief. It
seems to us perfectly clear, upon the received principles of ie

law of evidence, that this was sufficient prima facie proof of the
genuineness and due execution of the original power, to be left
to the jury for their consideration of its weight and effect.
The next question is, whether sufficient ground was laid in
the evidence to establish the loss or destruction of the original
power, so as to let in secondary proof of its contents. We
think there was, considering the lapse of time since the original transaction, the diligence which had been used, the
searches which had been made, and the other attendant circumstances stated mcthe depositions, to fortify the presumption of such loss or destruction. This was the view of this
point taken by this court in the former decision, in 5 Peters
233, 242, though it was not then so directly before us, and
having heard the new argument addressed to us on the present occasion, we see no reason for departing from our former
opinion.
The remaining question then, is, whether the copy now
produced was proper secondary proof, entitled by law to be
admitted in evidence. The argument is, that it is a copy of
a copy, and so not admissible, and that the original record
might have been produced in evidence. By the laws of
Georgia, act of 1785, deeds of bargain and sale of lands are
required to be recorded in the county where the lands lie.
Prince's Dig. 112. Powers of attorney to convey lands, are
not required by law to be recorded in the same county, though
there seems to be a common practice so to do. The act of
1785 provides, that all bonds, specialties, letters of attorney
and powers in writing, the execution whereof shall be proved
by one or more of the witnesses thereto, before certain magistrates of either of the United States, where the same ° were
executed, and duly certified in the manner stated in the act,
shall be sufficient evidence to the court and jury of the due
execution thereof. Prince's Dig. 113. The present power
was not recorded in the county of Franklin where the lands
lie, but in Richmond county, and therefore, a copy from the
record is not strictly admissible in evidence, as it would have
been if powers of attorney were by law to be recorded in the
county where the lands lie, and the present power had
been so duly recorded. It is certainly a common practice
to produce, in the custody of the clerk, under a subpcena
I

[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

duces tecum, the original records of deeds duly recorded.
But in point of law a copy from such record is admissible in
evidence, upon the ground stated in Lynch v. Clark, 3 Salk.
Rep. 154, that where an original document of a public nature
would be evidence if produced, an immediate sworn copy
thereof is admissible in evidence, for as all persons have a
right to the evidence which documents of a public nature
afford, they might otherwise be required to be exhibited at different places at the same time. See Mr Leach's note to 11
Mod. Rep. 134, Birt v Barlow, 1 Doug. Rep. 171, 1 Starkie
on Evidence, sec. 36, 37. If, therefore, the record itself
would be evidence of a recorded deed, a duly attested copy
thereof would also be evidence.
The present copy does
not, however, (as is admitted) fall within the reach of this
rule. But the question does arise, whether the defendant can
insist upon the production of the record books of the county of
Richmond, in court, in this case., as higher and more authentic
evidence of the power of attorney not properly recorded there,
to the exclusion of any other copy duly established in proof.
We think he cannot. It is not required by any rule of evidence with which we are acquainted.
We admit that the rule, that a copy of a copy is not admissible evidence, is correct in ilself, when properly understood and
limited to its true sense. The rule properly applies to cases
where the copy is taken from a copy, the original being still
in existence and capable of being compared with it, for then
it is a second remove from the original or where it is a copy
of a copy of a record, the record being in existence, by law
deemed as high evidence as the original, for then it is also a
second remove from the record. But it is quite a different
question whether it applies to cases of secondary evidence
where the original is lost, or the record of it is not in law
deemed as high evidence as the original, or, where the copy
of a copy is the highest proof in existence. On these points
we give no opinion, because this is not, in our judgment, the
case of a mere, copy of a copy verified as such, but it is the
case of a second copy verified as a true copy of the original.
Mr Robertson, expressly asserts that the record was a copy of
the original power made by himself, and that the present copy
is a true copy which has been compared by himself with the

SUPREME COURT
[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

record. In effect, therefore, he swears that both are true
copies of the original power. In point of evidence then, the
case stands precisely in the same predicament as if the witness
had made two copies at the same time of the original, and had
then compared one of them with the original, and the other
with the first copy, which he had found correct. The mode
by which he had arrived at the result, that the second is a true
copy of the original, may be more circuitous than that by
which he has ascertained the first to be correct, but that only
furnishes matter of observation as to the strength of the proof,
and not as to its dignity or degree. In each case his testimony
amounts to the same result, as a matter of personal knowledge,
that each is a true copy of the original. We are therefore
of opinion, that there was no error in the court in admitting
the copy in evidence under these circumstances.
In the further progress of the trial, additional evidence was
offered, and thereupon the defendants prayed the court to instruct the jury, 1. That if the jury believed that Basil Jones,
the deputy surveyor and grantee under whom the lessor of
the plaintiff claimed-by designating the stream marked on
the original plat as the Branch of the South Fork of the
Oconee river, instead of the South Fork of the Oconee river,
and by stating that the land was situate in the county of Franklin, when a large part of it lay without the county of Franklin,
and without the temporary boundary line of the state of Georgia
-practised a deception upon the governor of Georgia, and
thereby induced him to issue the grant, that such grant is
fraudulent and void, and cannot entitle the plaintiff to recover.
2. That a grant of land is an entirety, and that a grant void in
part is void-for the whole. 3. That a concealment or misrepresentation of material facts, calculated to deceive the governor issuing the grant, renders the grant null and void in law
The court refused to give either of these instructions, and the
question now is, whether all or either of them ought to have
been given.
The first instruction is couched in language not wholly unobjectionable or free from ambiguity. It assumes certain facts
to be established in the case, without referring them to the
decision of the jury, and on them founds the instruction, which
is certainly not a -orrect practice. It also uses the words

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

"practised a deception," without adding any qualifying words,
whether the deception was knowingly and wilfully practised
for the purposes of fraud, or whether it was by mistake of law or
fact, or by misplaced confidence in the representations of other
persons. And it is certainly the duty of a party asking an instruction to use language of such a definite and legal interpretation, as may not mislead either the court or jury in regard to
the precise nature of the application.
But waiving this consideration, the instruction asked makes
no distinction between the case of a fraudulent grantee and
the case of a bona fide purchaser from such grantee, without
notice, a distinction most important in itself, and in many
cases decisive in favour of the purchaser, whatever may have
been the fraud of the original grantee.
It is unnecessary, however, to rely on this circumstance,
for, stripping the instruction of its technical form, it comes to
this, that if any part of the land included in the grant lay
within the Indian boundary, and the governor was deceived
as to that fact, the grant is void for the whole land, not only
for that within the Indian boundary, but for all that lying
within the limits of the state. This proposition is attempted
to be maintained by the doctrine, that a grant void in part is
void as to the whole. And certain authorities at the common
law have been cited at the bar in support of the doctrine. We
have examined those authorities, and are of opinion that they
do not apply to cases like the present. There are doubtless
cases where grants and securities, made contrary to the prohibitions of a statute in part, are, upon the true construction of
the intent of the statute, void in toto. But Lord Hobart informs us, that it is very different in cases standing merely upon
the common law. For (to use his quaint but expressive language) "the statute is like a tyrant, where he comes, he
makes all void but the common law is like a nursing father,
and makes void only that part where the fault is, and preserves the rest." See also Norton v. Simmes, Hob. Rep. 14,
Maleverer v Redshaw, 1 Mod. Rep. 35, Collins v Blantern,
2 Wilson's Rep. 351. And, therefore, at the common law, in
order to make a grant void in toto for fraud or covin, the fraud
or covin must infect the whole transaction, or be so mixed up
in it as not to be capable of a distinct and separate considera-

[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

tion. The case of Hyslop v. Clarke, 14 Johns. Rep. 458, was
a case of fraud, where both the grantors and grantees and assignees were privy to a meditated fraud against creditors, and
therefore it was held void in toto. The case of Butler v. Dorant, 3 Taunt. Rep. 229, which is very shortly reported, seems
to have proceeded upon the ground, that the statute avoided
the security in toto. If it did not, it seems questionable in its
doctrine.
In the present case, there is no statute of Georgia, which
declares all grants of land lying partly within, and partly without the Indian boundaries, to be void in toto. And the policy
of the legislature of Georgia, on this subject, is sufficiently vindicated by holding such grants void as to the part within the
Indian boundary, leaving the grant good as to the residue.
This very point was, in fact, decided by this court in Patterson
v Jenks, 2 Peters 216, 235. One question there was, whether
the whole grant (a similar grant) was a nullity, because it
contains some'land not grantable. Ir answer to the question,
Mr Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion of the
court, said, " In the nature of the thing, we perceive no reason why the grant should not be good for land which it might
lawfully pass, and void as to that part of the tract, for thegranting of which the office had not been opened. It is every
day's practice to make grants for lands, which have, in fact, been
granted to others. It has never been suggested that the whole
grant is void, because a part of the land was not grantable."
We are entirely satisfied with this doctrine, as equally founded
in law and reason. The land in controversy in the present suit
is within the acknowledged boundary of Georgia, and without
the Indian boundary, and admitting the grant to be void as
to the part within the Indian boundary, it is, in our judgment,
valid as to the residue, notwithstanding the supposed deception
stated in the instruction for that deception did not affect with
fraud any part of the transaction, except as to the land within
the Indian boundary. The instruction, therefore, was rightly
refused by the court.
The second instruction may be disposed of in a few words.
It contains a proposition absolutely universal in its terms, that
a grant of lands is an entirety, and that a grant void in part, is
void for the whole. If this proposition were true, then a grant

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Winn and others v. Patterson.]

of ten thousand acres, which was void for any cause whatever
as a conveyance of one acre, although it might be for want of
title in the grantor, would be void for the remaining nine thousand nine hundred and mnety-nine acres. It is sufficient to
say, that the instruction so generally framed, ought not to
have been given.
The third instruction admits of a similar answer. It is universal in its terms, and states, "that a concealment or misrepresentation of material facts" (not stating whether innocently
or designedly and fraudulently made), "calculated to deceive
the governor, issuing the grant" (not stating whether he was
actually deceived or not), "renders the grant null and void in
law," as to all persons whatever, not stating whether the party
is the original grantee, or a bona fide purchaser under him,
without notice. For the reasons already stated, such an instruction, so generally stated, ought not to have been given.
Upon the whole, we are all of opinion, that the judgment of
the circuit court ought to be affirmed, with costs.
