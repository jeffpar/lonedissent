ELISHA BLooMEn, APPELLANT, V. JOHN14 W. McQuEWAN, ALLEN
R. MCQUEiWAN, AND SAMUEL DOUGLAS, PARTNERS, UNDVR THE

NAME OF McQuEwANs & DOUGLAS.
The patent for Woodworth's planing machine was extended from 1842 to 1843, by
the Board of Cominizsioners.
Under that extension, this court decided, in Wilso-d v. Rousseau, (4 How. 688,) that
an assignee had a right to continue the use of the machine which he then had.
In 1845, Congress, by a special act, extended the time still farther from 1849 to 1856:
Under that extension, an assignee has still the same right.
By the cases of Evans v. Eatofi, (3 Wheaton, 548,) and Wilsonv. Ronss~au, (4 How.
688,) these two propositions are settled, viz.:
1. That a-special act of Congress in favor of a patentee, extending the time beyond
that originally limited, must be considered as ingrafted on the getieral law.
2. That, under the general law in force when this special act of Congress was passed,
a party who had purchased the right to use a planing machine during the period to
which the patent was first limited, was entitled to continue to use it during the extension authorized by that law, unless there issomething in the law itself to forbid it.
But there is nothing in the act of Congress, passed in 1845, forbidding such use; and,
therefore, the assignee has the right.

THis was an dppeal from the Circuit Cotrt of the United.

Wilson's title is set forth in the report of the case of Wilson v.
tousseau, 4 Howard, 646, as is also the act of Congress passed
on the 26th February, 1845, (4 How. 662,) extending the patent
for seven years from the 27th of December, 1.849.
* 'McQuewan claimed, through -two mesne assignments from
Woodw6rth and Strong, by virtue of a'licEnse granted on the
8th of Novembei, 1833.
The bill and answer covered a great deal of ground, which
need not be noticed in this report.
Amongst other averments was this, that the license conveyed
no right to use the machine during the extension for seven years
from 1849, under the act of Congress passed in 1845; and the
deQision of the court being in favor of the defendants below
-upon this point, it is unnecessary to state all the points and
arguments upon other matters.

It was argued by Mr. Keller and Mr. S1. George .T. CampDunlop, for the appellees.
bell, for the appellant, and .Mr.
The fourth point made by the counsel for the appellant was
as follows:
IV. Whether the licensee of a right to use the patented machine for the original term of the patent, is entitled to continue
the use of the'same during the extension by Congregs.
The facts in this regard appearing by the record, are
1. That Collins and Smith, who were assignees for the first
term of the.disfriet in question, granted to 'Barnet thE right for
the city of Pittsburg and Allegnany county, "to construct and
use during the residue of the said terms of fourteen years," the
patented. machine, and by the same assignment covenanted
".not themselves to construct and use," nor to give license to
any other person than Barnet " durinag the te~ms aforesaid," and
Barnet covenanted not to construct more than fifty machines
"during the terms aforesaid."
(The word "terms" is used in the plural, ss it will be perceived by the assignment that the grantors were the awners also
of the Emmons patent, and that the limitation of his right applied to the-duration of both.)
2. Barnet assigns all his "right, title, interest, and claim of
the within patent for Woodworth's planingjnachine to G. Warner and John W. McQuewan, their heirs and assigns," except
seven rights previously given.

co-defendants, and that the machine was made during the first
term of the patent; hence arise the question, have the appellees
the right to continue its use during the congressional exten'sion?
For the appeUants it is'submittedt:
1. That this question, and the principles upon which it must
be decided, have been already passed upon by this court.
In Wilson v. Rousseau, (4 Howard,) the question was of the
right of the license .to continue the use of the machine during
the extension by the commissioner. The court were'divided in
opinion. In that delivered -as their judgment, the right of the
licensee to the continued use was put exclusively upon the terms
of the 18th section, which were "The benefit of such renewal
shall extend to assignees and grantees of the right to use the.
thing patented, to the extent of their respective interests therein."
Without that provision it is conceded by the learned judge, in
delivering the opinion of the court, "that all the rights of assignees or grantees, whether in -a share of the patent or to a
-pecified portion of the territory held under it, terminate-at the
end of the fourteen years, and become reinvested in the patentee
by the new grant." .
" From fhat date he is again possessed of 'the full and exclusive right and liberty of making, using, and vending to others
the invention,' whatever it may be, not only portions of. the
monopoly held by assignees and grantees, as subjects of trade
and commerce, but the patented articles or machines throughout
the country, purchased for practical use ih the business affairs
of life, are embraced within the operation of the extension.
This latter clas's of assignees and grantees are reached by the
new grant of the exclusive right to use the things patented.
Purchasers of the machines, and who were in the use of them
at the time, are disabled from further use immediately, as that
right became vested exclusively in tb patentee. Making and
vending the invention are prohibited by the corresponding terms
of his grant."
And the learned Judge, in expressing the opinion of the court,
further declared that the provision in the .18th section, above
referred to, was "intended to restore or save to them," (those
in use of the thing patented at the time of the renewal,) "that
right which, without the clause, would have been vested again
exclusively in the patentee."
And the learned Judges who dissented from the opinion of the
court did so upon the ground that even this clause of the 18th
section did not confer upon the licensees the right claimed in
their behalf.
Thus it is clear that the extension.of a patent by lawful.
voL. XIv.

SUPREME COURT.
Bloomer v. McQuewan et al

authority revests in the patentee every right originally possessed by him, and that unless the law, by virtue of which it is
extended, contains a provision in favor of licensees or as.ignees,
their right to use ends with the term of the-,r license. (This, of
course, does not apply to cases where the patentee has covenanted to grant any subsequently acquired extensions- none
such is pretended in this case.)
Applying, then, these principles to the act extending this
patent, (February 26, 1845,) it will be seen that it contains no
such provision as is to be found- in the 181h stction of the act
of 1836; and that, therefore, in accordance with the opinion of
all the judges, the efitire right was reinveste l in the patentee.
The general power to renew and extend a patent is conferred
by the 18th section of the-act of 1836, which, after providing for
-the proof of the prerequisites, declares that "it shall be the duty
of the Commissioner to renew and extend the patent, by mreking
a certificate thereon of such extension" for the term of seven
years from and after the expiration of the first term."
The act in question provides that the patent "be, and the
same is hereby extended for the term of seven years from and
after the 27th of December, 1849, and the Commissioner of
Patents is hereby directed to make a certificate of such extension in the name of the administrator of William Woodworth,
and append an authenticated copy thereof to the original letterspatent," &c.; the words being substantially the same as these,
judicially construed, and the intention being still further hiarked,
as-well by the.omission of any provision for the licensees, as by
the express insertion of the name of the party in whose favor
the extensfoz was made, and to whose benefit it was intended
to enure.
The principles upon which the judgment in Wilson v. Rousseau, is founded, are, it is*submitted, if possible, more conclusively applicable to the case of such an extension by Congress
than to one made by the Commissioner.
â€¢Such, too, has been the application made of them by many
of the learned Judges in their circuits; By Mr. Justice Nelson,
July 22, 1850, in Gibson v. Gifford, in a written opiniori delivered
by him; by the late Mr. Justice Woodbury, July; 1850, in Mason
v. Tallman, also in a written opinion; and by Mr. Justice Me
Lean, October 22, 1850, in Bloomer v. Stately.
The opinion of Mr. Justice Woodbury refers" to similar decisions made by the late Justice McKinley, by Judge Ware, and
Judge Sprague.
It may be proper, with reference to the argument founded
upon the supposed intention of Congress, (not declared in the
words of the act'as already shown,) to permit a continued use

the original term, to annex a list of the patents, extended by
special acts, and thus to refer to the provisions in each, .expressly
declaring, where such was intended, the existence of such right,
and providing for its mode of exercise or enjoyment.
The absence of such provision in the act of 1845, must, it is
submitted, conclusively negative any idea of such intention, even
if the judicially decided effect of such an act did not render
a reference to such a source for interpretation, unnecessary.

The point that; by an accidental error in the bill, the word
"fourteen" waa inserted, instead of "vtwety-eight,"
is not
deemed a proper subject bf objection in "this court. No such
ground appears to have been taken below; the patent itself forms
part of the record, and an amendment would have been, it is
submitted, instantly allowed by the court below, had the objection been there made. That the patent on its face was for
twenty-eight years, forms one of the objections of the appellees
to its validity, and the error complained of is set right by answer
of the defendants themselves.
It is not deemed, necessary by the appellants to present any
authorities to meet the point argued by the appellees, that an
act of Congress, extending a patent for seven years, is unconstitutional
and void.
It is therefore
submitted that the decree should be reversed,
and that the appellant is entitled to a perpetual injunction and
an account.
The counsel for the appellees made seveal points, amongst
which was the following:
1. That, defendants are protected as assignees.
The bill (pages 14 to 20) asserts, and the answer admits, that
the respondents claim to use the machine they are alleged to
have infringed, as assignees, from 1833, the year of their purchase, under assignments from the original patentee. Being then
assignees under the original patent, can they claim to continue
unmolested in the use of the machine they pirchased and paid
for, and have erected and used for seventeen years?
Was it the design of the act of 1845, to bring disasters upon
the respondents, to deprive them of the rights they had acquired in good faith, to deprepiate their property, to render
useless their establishments, in which they had invested large
sums of money, to destroy their business, and disable them from
the performance of their contracts? Such flagrant outrages
are not to be imputed to a statute, unless the terms of it imperatively demand it.
The language of the act calls for no such harsh, unreasonable, and impolitic construction. It is a simple extension of the
patent of 1828, and nothing more. Could any design in Con-

gtess to spread such disastprs, be predicated of the simple meaning of this statute?
Chief Justice Gibson, of Pennsylvania, has laid down a rule
which must commend itself to the judgment of every one,- that
in the construction of statutes, the Judges, when one of those
cases of hardship occurs, which -continually arise, should do
what their consciences irresistibly persuade them the legisla.
ture would have done, if the occurrence had been foreseen.
Pennock v. Hart, 8 S. & R. 369.
Aud can any one doubt that if the idea of the propriety of
protecting the purchasers of rights, and the uses of the thing
patent6d, had been suggested, but they would imniediately have
inserted such a clause?
This act of 1845 is a private act, made for the special benefit
of a particular individual, and should not have such construc
tiofi as will be detrimental to others. Chief Justice Parsons, in
the case of Coolidge v. Williams, has laid down the rule to be
that private statutes, made for the accommodation of particular citizens or corporations, ought not to be construed to affect.
the rights or privileges of others, unless such construction, results from express words, or from necessary implication. 4
Mass. 145.
There are no express words in this statute, which demands
the construction contended for by the plaintiff.
We may appeal, too, to the language of Mr. Justice Wash.
ington, in the case of Evans v. Jordan, that arguments founded
upon hardship, would be entitled to great weight, if the language of the act was not so peremptory as -to forbid a construction at variance with the clear meaning of the legislature
9 Cranch, 199.
There are no words in this act to justify such savage construction as urged by the plaintiff It declares a simple extension of
the patent, and manilestly intends an extension similar to that
Which may be confei.red by the Patent-Office, under which the
rights of persons, using the invented machine under license, are
protected in the enjoyment of it.
The same learned Chief Justice of Massachusetts, has also
declared in the case of Wales v. Stetson, that iii the consideration of the provisions of any statute, they ought to receive such
a reasonable construction if the words and subject-matter will
admit of it, as that the existing rights of the public or individuals be not injured. 2 Mass. 146.
If the legislature meant a simple extension of the patent for
seven years, is it not a reasonable construction to suppose that
it meant an extension, as ordinarily understood; as an exten-.
sion of the nature of the 6xtensions of the Patent-Office, and
46 *

SUPREmp, COURT.
Bloomer v. 31cQuiewan et al.

with the restrictions and privileges of such extensions? Is it
not reasonable to conclude that they had in their mind the general act of 1836, and the clause which gave to purchasers and
users of the thing patented, the right to continue that use? Is
it not a reasonable constructign that they meant that this special
act should be construed in reference to the general law of the
land? The language-of the act is, that the patent of 1828 "be
extended for seven years." Now what benefit would that extension be, even to complainant, without an incorporation with
the general law? How c6uld he be assignee of the right? how
could he enjoy the use of the patent? how could he pretend to
recover damages, without an appeal for aid to the act of 1836 ?
The plaintiff is obliged to invoke the aid of the general law, to
maintain this very action. The very plaintiff in this cause is
an assignee, and undertakes to maintain ths action in his own
name, by calling into requisition the act of 1836.
The rule of law undoubtedly is, that laws on the same subject are to be construed together; that laws on the same subject
are to be construed pari passu, and with reference to parallel
legislation. This is clearly the rule as to general laws, which
in relation to the same subject, are to be ccnstrued as one act.
They are to be construed, too, in reference to parallel legislation.
Penn v. Hamilton, 2 Watts, 60; 17 S. & R. 81; 7 Id. 404.
The right of appeal, given by the Pennsylvania ac relating
to divorces a vinculo inatrinonii, was extended by implication,
to the act of 1817, respecting divorces a vensa et thoro. Roberts v. Roberts, 9 S. & R. 191.
So the right to appeal from justices' judgments, in cases of
contracts, was held to extend to trespass, to which the powers
of magistrates had been extended, without expressly giving the
right of appeal. 4 S.& R. 73.
And this wise and safe rule of construction has been held to
'apply to statutes which have been repealed, or may not have
been noticed by the statutes to be construed. Rex v. Loxdale,
1 Burr. 447.
And Lord Mansfield, in that case, said, "that where there are
different statutes in pari materia,though made at different times,
or even expired, and not referring to each other, they shall be
taken and construed together, as one system." In the expressive language of Tilghman, Ch. J., of Pennsylvania, in one of
the cases cited, they were so blended together as -1o form one
statute.
-And from the cases cited from Burrow, tlis blending of statutes, this analogy of legislation, is not condned to public statutes, but that public laws may receive aid in their construction
from private laws, and vice versa; for his Lordship says, in the

case cited, page 448, that the act of Parliament, of 1740, relating
to St. Martins, and the overseers of that parish, (which was, I
apprehend, clearly a private act,) which extended the number of
overseers of the poor to be appointed by two justices, under the
general act of 43 Elizabeth, to the number of nine, "shows"
(says the Chief Justice) "the construction put by the legislature themselves, upon the 43 Elizabeth, on this head, and excepts
this very large parish of St. Martins. out of it.
I need not burden your honors with any name of books on
this, so obvious a rule of construction. This case, in Burrow,
was carefully considered; it had been argued several times beforn Ch. J. Ryder, and afterwards before Lord Mansfield, by great
counsel, and if any case is entitled to respect of courts, it is a
case so considered, and so decided.
But we have cases nearer home, and more german to this iery
matter of private acts, in relation to these very patent-rights.
In the case of Evans v. Eaton, (3 Wheat:454,) it was declared,
that an act of Congress, authorizing the Secretary of State to
issue a patent to Oliver Evans, for his improvements in the
manufacture of 'flour, " was ingrafted on the general act for thd
promotion of useful arts, and that the patent was issued under
both acts," the public and the private one.
So in the case of Evans v. Jordan, 9 Crancl, 199, which was
an action to recover damages under the same private act, Washington, J., said, in declaring the opinion of the court, that "it
should be recollected, that the right of the, plaintiff to recover
damages for using his improvement, after the issuing of his,
patent, arises, not under this law, but the general law of 1793."
If the plaintiff is obliged to invoke the aid of the act of 1836,
he must take the whole of it. It is a'well-established rule of
law, that he who claims the benefit of his title, must admit its
disadvantages. Qui senlit commodum sentire debet et onus.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the eourt.
The bill in this case was filed by the appellants, on the 6th of
July, 1850, in the Circuit Court of the United States, for the
Western District of Pennsylvania, to obtain -an injunction restraining the appellees from -the use of two of Woodworth's
planing Vnachines in the city of Pittsburg. The term for which
Woodworth's patent was originally granted, expired in 1842,
but it was extended seven years by the board established by the
18th section of the act of 1836. And afterwards, by the act of
Congress of February 26, 1845, this patent was extended for
seven years more, commencing on the 27th of December, 1849,
at which lime the previous exteusion would have terminated.
It appears, from the pleadings. and evidence in the case, that

648

SUPREME COURT.
Bloomer v. McQuewan el; al.

shortly after the passage of the act of Congress of 1845, Wil.
liam Woodworth, the administrator of the patentee, in whose
name the certificate of extension was directed to be issueld, assigned all his right to James G. Wilson, fi'om whom the appellant purchased the exclusive right to cp.nstruct and use this.
machine, and to vend to others the right to construct and use it,
in a large district of c6untry described in the grant. Pittsburg,
in which the machines in question are used, is included within
these limits. And the right which the appellant purchased was
regularly transferred to him, by Wilson, by an instrument of
writing duly recorded in the Patent-Office.
In the year 1833, during the term for which the patent was
originally granted, the defendants purchased the right to construct and use a certain number of these machines within the
limits of the city of Pittsburg and Alleghany county; and the
right to do so was regularly transferred to them by different
assignments, deriving their title from the original patentee. The
two machines mentioned in the bill were constructed and used
by the respondents soon after the purchase was made, and the
appellees continued to use them up to the time when this bill
was filed. And the question is, whether their right to use them
terminated with the first extension, or still continues under the
extension granted by the act of 1845.
The 'Circuit Court decided that the right of the appellees still
continued, and upon that ground dismissed the appellant's bill.
And the case is now before us upon an appeal from that decree.
In determining this question we must take into consideration
not only the special act under which the appellant now claims
a ronopoly, but also the general laws of Congress in relation to
patents for useful improvements, and the special acts which
have from time to time been passed in favor of the particular
patentees. They are statutes in pari materia; and all relate to
the same subject, and must be construed together. It was so
held in the case of Evans v. Eaton, (3 Whieat. 518,) where the
court said-that the special act of Congress in favor of Oliver
Evans, granting him a niew patent for fourtaen years, for his improvements in manufacturing flour and meal, was ingrafted on
the general act.for the promotion of useful arts, and the patent
issued in pursuance of both. The rule applies with more frce
in'the present case; for this is not the grant of a new patent,
but an enlargement of the time for which a patent previously
extended under the act of 1836, should continue in force.
Indeed, this rule 6f construction is necessary to give effect to
the special'act under which the appellant claims the monopoly.
For this law does not define the rights or privileges which the
patent shall confer, nor prescribe the remedy to which he shall
-

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

549

Bloomer v. McQuewan et al.

be entitled if his rights are infringed. It merely exterids the
duration of the patent, and nothing more. And we are necessarily referred, therefore, to the general law upon the subject to
ascertain the rights to which the patent entitled him, and also.
the remedy which the law affords him if these rights are invaded.
Now, the act of 1836, in express terms, gives the benefit of the
extension authorized by that law to the assignees and grantees
of the right to use the thing patented to the extent of. their respective interests therein. And under this provision it was
decided, in the case of Wilson v. Rousseau, (4 Howard, 688,) that
the party who had purchased and was using this planing machine during the original term for which the patent was granted,
had a right to coatinud the use during the extension. And the
distinction is there taken between the grant of the right to make
and vend the machine, and the grant of the right to use it.
The distinction is a plain one. The franchise* which'the
patent grants, consists altogether, in the right to exclude every
one from making, using, or vending the thing patented, without
the perynission of the patentee. This is all that he obtains by
the patent. And when he sells the exclusive privilege of making
or vending it for use in a particular place, the purchaser buys a
portion of the franchise which the patent confers. He obtains
a share in the monopoly, and that monolpoly is derived from,
and exercised under, the protection of the United States. And
the interest he acquires, necessarily terminates at the time limited
for its continuance by the law which .created it. The patentee
cannot sell it for a longer time. And the purchaser buys with
referenee to'that period; the time for which exclusive privilege
is to endure being one of the chief elements of its value. "He
therefore has no just claim to share in a further monopoly subsequently acquired by the patentee. He does not purchase or
pay for it.
But the purchaser of the implement or machine for the purpose of using it in the prdinary pursuits of life, stands on different ground. In using it, he exercises no rights created by the
act of Congress, nor does he derive title to it by virtue of the
franchise or exclusive privilege granted to the patentee. The
inventor might lawfully sell it to him, whether he had"a patent
or not, if no other patentee stood in his way. And when the
machine passes to the hands of the purchaser, it is no longer
within the limits of the monopuly. It passes outside of. it, and
is no longer under the protection of the act of Congress. And.
if his right tb the implement or machine is infringed, he must
seek redress in the courts of the State, according to the laws .of
the State, and not in the courts of the United States, nor under

550

the law of Congress granting the patent. The implement or
machine becomes his private, individual property, not protected
by the laws of the United States, but by the laws of the State
in which it is situated. Contracts, in relation to it are regulated by the laws of the State, and are subject to State jurisdiction. It was so decided in this court, in the case of Wilson
v. Sanford and others, 10 Howard, 99. Like other individual
property, it is then subject to State taxation; and from the
great number of patented articles now in use, they no doubt,
in some of the States, form no inconsiderable portion of its taxable property.
Moreover, the value of the implement or machine in the hands
of the purchaser for use, does not in any degree depend on the*
time for which the exclusive privilege i, granted to the patentee; nor upon the exclusion of others from its use. For example, in the various patented articles used in agriculture, in
milling, in manufactures of different kinds, ir steam-engines, or
for household or other purposes, the value to the purchaser is
not enhanced by the continuance of the monopoly. It is of no
importance to him whether it endures for a year or twenty-eight
years. He does not look to the duration cf the exclusive privilege, .ut to the usefulness of the thing he buys, and the advantages he will derive from its use. He buys the article for
the purpose of using it as long as it is fit for use and found, to
be profitable. And in the case before us the respondents derive
no advantage from the extension of the patent, because the
patentee may place around them as many planing inachines as
be pleases, so as to reduce the profits of tao. e which they own
to their just value in an open and fair competition.
It is doubtless upon these Principles that the act of 1836
drais the distinction between the assignee of a share in the
monopoly, and the purchase of one or more machines, to be
used in the ordinary pursuits of business. And that distinction
is clearly pointed out and maintained in the case of Wilson v.
Rousseau, before referred to.
Upon the authority, therefore, of the cases of Evans v. Eaton,
and .Wilson v. Rousseau, these two propositions may be regardedas settled by judicial decision . 1. 'That a special act of
Congress in favor of a patentee, extending the time beyond that
originally limited, must be considered as ingrafted on the gene.
ral law; and 2. That under the general law, in force when this
special act of Congresswas passed, a party who had purchased
the right to use- a planing machine during the ppriod to which
the patent was first limited, was entitled to continue to use it
during .the extension authorized by that law.
Applying these rules to the case before us, the respondents

551

Bloomer v. McQuewan et I.

must be entitled to continue the use of their planiig rmachines
during the time for which the patent is extended by the special
act of Congress, unless there is something in the language of
the law requiring a different construction.
But there is nothing in the law to justify the distinction
claimed in this respect on behalf of the patentee. Its language
is plain and unambiguous. It does not even grant a new patent,
as in the case of Oliver Evans. It merely extends the time of
the monopoly to which the patentee was entitled under the
general law of 1836. It gives no new rights or privileges, to be
superadded to those he then enjoyed, except as to the time they
should endure. The patent, such as it then was, is continued for
seven years longer than the period before limited. And this is
the whole and only provision contained in this special act. In
order, therefore, to determine the rights of the patentee during
the extended term, we are necessarily referred to the general
law, and compelled to' inquire what they were before this special act operated upon them, and continued them'. Indeed, the
court has been obliged to recur to the act of 1836, in everystage of this suit, to guide it in deciding upon the rights of tle
parties, and the mode of proceeding in which th6y are to be
tried. It is necessarily referred to in order to determine whether
the patent under which the complainant claims, was issued by
lawful authority, and in the form prescribed by law; it was
necessary to refer to it in the Circuit Court in order t6 determine whether the patentee was entitled to the patent, as the
original inventor, that fact being disputed in"the Circuit Court;
also, for the notices to which he was entitled in the trial df that
question; and for the forum in which he was authorized to sue
for an infringeinent of his rights. And the rights of the appel,
lant to bring the case before the court for adjudication is derived
altogether from the provisions'of the general law. For there is
no evidence in the record to show that the machines are worth
two thousand dollars, and no appeal therefore would lie from
the decision of the Circuit Court, but for the special provision
in relation to patent cases in the act of 1836. And while it is
admitted that this special act is so ingrafted on the general law,
as to entitle the patentee to all the rights and privileges -hich
that law has 1irovided, for the benefit and protection of inventors, it can hardly be maintained that the one in favor of the
purchaser of a machine is by construction to be excepted from
it, when there are no words in -the special act tor indicate that
such was the intention of Congress.
This construction is confirmed by the various special acts.
which have been passed from time to time, in favor of particular,
inventors, granting them new patents after the first had expired

SUPREME COURT.
Bloomer v. McQuewan et al.

or extending the time for which they were originally granted.
Many of these acts have been referred to in the argument, some
of which contain express provisions, protecting the rights of the
purchaser under the first term, and others contain no provision on
the subject, and merely grant a new patent, or, as in the case
before the court, extend the duration of the old one. And in
several instances special laws in favor of differeft inventors
have been passed within a short time of each other, in one of
which the rights of the previous purchaser are expressly reserved,
and in the other there is no provision on, the subject. And the
act of March 3, 1845, authorizing the patent of William Gale,
for an impiovement in the manufacture of silver spoons and
forks to be extended, was passed only a few days after the act
in favor of Woodworth, and Gale's patent is subjected in express terms to the conditions and restrictions in the act of 1836,
and consequently protects previous purchasers from a new denmand.
It has been contended, on behalf of the appellant, that the
insertion of these restrictions in one special law, and the omission of them in another, shows that, in the latter, Congress did
not intend to exempt the purchaser from the necessity of obtaining a new license from the patentee. And that Congress might
well suppose that one inventor had stronger claims upon the
public than another, and might, oh that account, give him larger
privileges on the renewal.
But this argument only looks to one side of the question, that
is, to the interest and claims of the inventor. There is another,
and numerous class of persons, who have purchased patented
articles, and paid for them the full price which the patentee demanded, and we are bound to suppose that their interests and
their rights would not be overlooked or disregarded by Congress.
And still less, that any distinction would be drawn between
those who purchased one description of patented machines and
those who purchased another. For example, the act granting a
new patent to Blanchard, in 1834, for cut1ing or turning irregular forms, saves the rights of those who had bought under t6e
original patent. And we ought not to presume, without plain
words to require it, that while Congress acknowledged the justice of such elaims in the case of Blanchard, they intended to
disregard them in the case of Woodworth. Nor can it be said
that the policy of 'Congress has changed in this respect after
1834, when Blanchard's patent was renewed. For, as we have
already said, the same jprotection is given to purchasers in the
special01aw, authorizing the renewal of Gale's patent, which was
passed a few days after the law of which we are speaking.
The fair inference from all of these special laws is this, that

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

553

Bloomer v. McQuewan et.al.

Congress has constantly recognized the rights of those who pur.
chase for use a patented implement or machine; that in these
various special laws the patentee and purchasers of different
inventions were intended to be placed on the same ground; and
that the relative rights of both parties under the extension; by
special act of Congress, were intended to be the same as they
were when the extension was granted under the general law of
1836. It would seem that in some cases the attenti6n of the
legislature was more particularly called to the subject,-and the
rights of the purchaser recognized a'nd cautiously guarded.
And when the provision is omitted, the just presumption is, that
Congress legislated on the principle decided by this court in
Evans v. Eaton, and regarded the special law as ingrafted on
the general one, and subject to all of its restrictions and provisions, except only as to the time the patent- should endure.
Time is the only thing upon which they legislate. And any
other construction would make the legislation of Congress, on
these various special'laws, inconsistent with itself, and impute
to it the intention of dealing out a different measure of justice
to purchasers of different kinds of implemebts. and machines;
protecting some of them, and disregarding the equal and just
claims of others.
And if such cotuld be the interpretation of this law, the power
of Congress to pass it would be open to serious objections. For
it can hardly be maintained that Congress could lawfully deprive
a citizen of the use of his pr6perty after he had purchased the
absolute and unlimited right from the inventor, and when that
property was no longer held under the protection and control of
the General Government, but under the protection of the State,
and on that account subject to State taxation.
The 5th amendment to the Constitution of the United States
declares, that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, witlout due process of law.
The right to construct and use these planing machines, had
been purchased and paid for without any limitation as to the
time for which they were to be used. They were the property
of the respondents. Their only value consists in their use.
And a special act of Congress, passed afterwards, depriving the
appellees of the right to use them, certainly could not be regarded as due process of law.
Cong'ess undoubtedly have power to promote the progress of
science and useful arts, by securing for limited times, to authors
and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries.
But it does not follow that Congress may, from time to ti'me,
as often -as they think proper, authorize an inventor to recall

rights which he had granted to cithers; or reinvest in him rights
of property which he had before conveyed for a valuable and
fair consideration.
But we f6rbear to pursue this inquiry, because we are of
opinion that this -special act of Congress does not, and was not
intended to interfere with rights of property. before acquired; but
that it leaves them as they stood during the extension under the
general law. And in this view of the sub ect, the appellant was
not entitled to the injunction he sought to obtain, and the Circuit Court -were right in dismissing the bill.
As the decision on this point disposes of the case, it is unnecessary to examine the other grounds of defence taken by the
appellees.
The decree of the Circuit Court must be affirmed.

Mr. Justice McLEAN.
Woodworth's patent bears date the 27th of ;December, 1828,
and zuns for fourteen years. On the 29th Qt July, 1830, the
patenfees conveyed to Isaac Collins and Barzlllai C. Smith the
right to construct, use, and vend to others, thb planing machine
invented within several States, including Pennsylvania, exdept
the city of Philadelphia. On the 19th cf rlay, 1832, Collins
and Smith transferred to James Barnet the right to construct
and use, during the residue of the aforesaid term of fourteen
y~ars, fifty planing machines, within Pittsburg and Alleghany
county, for which he agreed to pay four thousand dollars. Barnet agreed not to construct or run more than fifty machines
"during the term aforesaid, and Collins and Smith bound themselves not to license during the term, nor to construct or use
themselves during the term, or allow others to do so, in the
limits of Pittsburg and Alleghany county.
On the 27th of December, 1842, the pate at expired, but it was
renewed' and extended for seven years, urnder the act of 1836.
This extension expired in 1849; but Congress, on the 26th of
February, 1845, passed an act which pro-vided that "the said
letters-patent be, and the same is hereby, extended for the term
of seven years, from and after the twenty-seventh day of December, 1849."
The patentee, by deed dated the 14th of March, 1845, and
also by a further deed dated the 9th of July, 1845, conveyed to
James E. Wil~on all his interest as administrator in the letters
patent under the extension by the act of Congress. And Wilson,
on the 4th of June, 1847, for fhe. consideration of twenty-five
thousand dollars, gave to Bloomer, the plaintiff, a license to con-

struct and use, and vend to others to construct and use, during
the two extensions, "all that part of Pennsylvania lying west
of the Alleghany Mountains, excepting Alleghany county, for
the first e.tension, which expires on the 27th day of December,
1849, and the States of Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and
Missouri, excepting certain parts of each State"
The defendants continued to run their machines during the
residue of the fourteen years, for which the patent was granted,
and during the first extension; and the complainant filed his
bill to enjoin the defendants from running their machines under
the second extension, by the act of Congress.
The contract of the defendants was entered into the 19th of
May, 1831, and under it Barnet had a right "to construct and
,use during the residue of the aforesaid term of fourteen yfars,
fifty planing machines," &c. The patent expired on the 27th
of Deceimber, in 1842. The contract of defendants was made
the 19th of May, 1832, leaving about nine years and six months
for the patent to run, and this was the time limited by the contract, and for which the consideration of four thousand dollars
was paid. This was not left to construction from the life of
the patent, but the contract expressly declared the right was
purchased "for the residue of the aforesaid term of fourteen
years."
This term was enjoyed by the defendants, and under the decision of this court, in the case of Wilson v. Rousseau et al. (4
Howard, 646,) the severf years' extension under the act of 1836,
was also enjoyed by the defendants. This construction of the
act of 1836, in my judgment, was not authorized, and was not
within the intention of the law, as was expressed at the time.
That extension having expired, another extension is claimed
under the act of Congress. This claim is set up to an injunction bill, filed by the complainant, who is the assignee of the
patent for a part of Pennsylvania and other States. And by
the decision of four of my brethren, just delivered, the defendants are to enjoy this extension, making fourteen years beyond
their control. This would seem to imply, that, under the act of
1836, and under the act of 1845, the assignees were the favored
objects of Congress. But this is not the case. The patentee
who made the invention, and through whose ingenuity, labor,
and. expense, a great benefit has been conferred on the public,
in justice, is entitled to remuneration, and that only was the
ground of extension, whether-under the law of 1836, or the
special act of 1845.
This, as well as the former debision, was influenced by.the
consideration that the, owners of the -machines are, in equity,
entitled to run them so long as the exclusive right of the patent

556

SUPREME COURT.
Bloomer v. McQuewan et al.

shall be continued. It is said that the machines are property,
and that no act of Congress sh6uld deprive the owners of the
use of their property. But in this view, the property of the
patentee seems not to be taken into the account. He is the
meritorious claimant for protection. The assignee for a specific
time, rests upon his. contract. He has conferred-no benefit on
society. - His investment was made with an exclusive reference
to his own advantage. He has no more claims upon the public
sympathy than he who rents a mill, a f'arm, or engages in a
business, open to all who exlect a profit by it.
But the hardship is supposed to exist, in the fact that, to use
the right, a planing machine rnust be oonstructed at an expense
,of some four or five hundred dollars, ahd this will be lost to the
occupier, if by an extension he shall not be permitted td run his
machine. The answer-is, when he entered into the contract he
Jnew, or is presumed to have known, that the patent might be
extended under the law of 1836 or by special act, and if he desired an interest under the renewed patent, he should have provided for it in his contract. Having failece to do this, it would
seem to be unjust that, under a contract to run the machine less
than ten years, he should be -entitled to run it 'sixteen years.
The consideration paid was limited to the term specified in the
contract. But, it is answered, that the assignee expected to run
his machine after thetermination of the contract on which the
exclusive right would end and Become vested in the public.
Let us examine this plea, and it will be found that a great
fallacy prevails on this subject. A right thaat is common, is no
more valuable to orle person than another, as all may use it.
The injury, then, consists, so far as the licensee is concerned, in
-thereduction of the value of his machine, by the extension of
the exclusive right in the patentee, to the exclusion of the assignee. It is true this deprives him of the. monopoly which his
contract secured to him. But he has enjoyed this to the extent
of'-his contract, and for which he has paid the stipulated consideration. Now his only equitable plea to run his machine during the renewed patent, arises alone from the supposed difference
.n the value of his machine, tinder the renewal, without a
license, and ,where the right becomes vested1 in the public;
, If there had been no renewal, the licensee might run his
machine, and any other person might run one. It is a fact
known to every observing individual, when a new business is set
up,.as a planing machine, supposed to be very profitable gene.
"rally,'a conpetition is excited, which reduces the profit below a
zeasonable compensation for the labor and expense of the businets. If the monopoly continued, as enjoyed under the contiact,*hte consideration paid for the -monopoly would be added

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

557

Bloomer v. McQuewan et al.

to the profits, which would make them large. But when the
mnopoly ceases, the profits, if not destroyed, are reduced by
competition, at least as low, if not below the ordinary profit of
capital employed in other investments.
If the business of the county or city required the number of
planing machines in operation, the licensee could sell his machine at a reasonable reduction for the time it had run. The
machines of the defendant had run, probably, from twelve to
fifteen years. A considerable reduction would be expected by
the purchaser, as a machine could not be expected to last more
than twenty years. But suppose it can be used thirty, then
one half of the value must be deducted for the wear of the
machine fifteen years, which would reduce it to some two hundred and fifty or three hundred dollars.
But suppose the exclusive right should be continued in the
patentee, by an extension of it seven years. Then, if the machines were not more numerous than the public required, they
would be wanted by their owners, or by. others disposed to engage in the business. And I hazard nothing in saying, that,
after deducting the compensation from the profits, paid for the
exclusive right, they would be larger than could be hoped for,
where the right was common.. Under such circumstances, I can
entertain no doubt, that a machine would sell for more money,
under the extension of the patent, than where the right goes to
the public.
The idea that to refuse the use of a machine under the extension of a patent, is an unjust interference with property, I
think, is unfounded. There is no interference with the property
in the machine. The owner may sell it to any one who has a
license to use it. It is not the property in the machine that is
complained of, but because the right to run it longer than the
contract provided for, is not given. The licensee has used the
franchise, as long as he purchased and paid for it; and can he
in justice claim more than his' contract. The extension of the
right to use, while the extended patent continues, does a wrong
to the patentee, by takiig his property, without compensation,
and giving it to the licensee. The franchise is property, and it
can no more be transferred to another, without compensation or
contract, than any other property. It would seem that this
description of property is not governed by contract. That a
contract to use the franchise ten years, does not mean what is
expressed, but may mean a right for twenty years, or any other
terra to which the patent may be extended.
Every man who has sense enough to make a contract, takes
into his estimate the contingency of a loss, to some extent, in
going out of the business. He fixes his own time for the con47*

SUPREME COURT.
Bloomer v. McQuewan el: al.

tract, and if he-wishes to provide for the contingency arising
from the renewal of a patent, he can embrace it in his contract
for a stipulated compensation.
It may be true, that, unless the contrary appear, when the
patentee sells a planing machine, a right to use it may be applied. But the right to construct and the right to use, are distinct. Some purchase of the patentee the right to construct
the- machine, others to use it. This planing machine cannot be
compared to a plough, or afly other article which may be considered the product of the patent. The rnachine is the instrument through which the plank is planed. The plank is the
product, and may be sold in the market as other property. But
the planing machine cannot be used, without a license. The
law protects the franchise, by prohibiting the use of the machine
without a license. When Barnet purchased the franchise for
the fifty machines, he did not buy the machines for a term as
long as the machines could run, but for nine years and six
months. The contract, neither expressly nor impliedly, extended
beyond that term.
In this view, I think that I am not mistaken, and if I am not,
the licehse is not injured a dollar by the termination of his right
to run his machine, as fixed in his contract. But, on whom is the
injury inflicted by extending the contract of the licensee with the
patentee, and that without compensation? In the present case,
the patentee has been injured, by the use of the fifty machines,
at least four thousand dollars, the amount agreed to be paid for
the right to run them less than ten years. And must not the
property of -the patentee be taken into the account, as well as
the imagined rights of the licens~e?
The patentee is justly considered a public benefactor. He
has conferred a great benefit upon the world; and he is entitled,
under our laws, to at least a compensation for his expense, ingenuity, -nd labor.
That the patentee is the only one whose interests are regarded,
as the ground of extending the patent in the act of 1836, is
clear. Now, suppose the patentee has assigned the whole of
the patent, without receiving such a compensation as the law
authorizes; there can be no doubt he is entitled, on" that ground,
to a renewal of the patent; and yet, under the decision now"
given, his assignees would receive all the benefits of the renewal. Should not this fact cause doubts whether the rule of
construction of the statute can be a sound one, which defeats
its avowed object? If this be the consequence of the assignment of the entire interest by the patentee, any partial assignment must produce the same result, though to a more' limited
extent. A principle -which will not bear thds test is not sound.

DECEMBER TERM,

559

Bloomer v. McQucwan et al.
The act of 1845, extending, this patent, annexed no condi-

tions.

The exclusive right was extended to the administrator

of Woodworth for seven years, from the 27th of December,
1849. But the decision now given, in effect declares this exclusive right is not given. Indeed the object of Congress must
be defeated if the machines, in operation at the time of the
passage of the act, are to be continued without compensation.
It is presumed there are few places where planing machines
were not constructed before 1849, the time the renewal took'
effect, if the public required them. On this supposition, the extension of the patent can be of little or no benefit to the heirs
of the patentee. Congress could have granted the act only
upon the ground to remunerate the heirs of the inventor.There seems to be a great mistake as to the profits of this
patent. It was a valuable patent, but, as in all other cases, its
value excited the rapacity of men who seek to enrich themselves by taking the property of others. The records of thecourts show, that piracies were committed on this patent in
every part of the country; and that to sustain it, much expenditure and labor have been required. It is stated that the sum of
near two hundred thousand dollars has been thus expended to
establish this patent. Congress have extended many patents;
in some instances conditions have been imposed, in others, the
franchise has been extended unconditionally. Now, where the
patent is extended by act of Congress, without conditions, I am
unable to perceive how the court can impose conditions. Such
an act would be legislation, and not construction.
By the act of the 15th February, 1847, the patent of Thomas
Blanchard, for cutting irregular forms out of wood, brass, or iron,
was extended for fourteen years, from the 20th of January,
1848: "Provided that such extension shall enure to the use and
benefit of the said Thomas Blanchard, his executors and adnilnistrators and to no othet persons whomsoever, except that a
bond fide assignee of the invention, by virtue of an assignment
from the patentee heretofore made, shall have the benefit of this
act, upon just, reasonable, and equitable terms, according to his
interest therein. And if the said Thomas Blanchard, his executors or administrators, cannot agree with such wssignee, the
terms shall be ascertained and determined by the Circuit Court
of the United States for the district in which such assignee
resides, to be decreed upon a bill to be filed by such assignee
for that purpose. And provided further, that no assignee shall
have the benefit of this act unless he shall, within ninety day's
from its passage, agree with the said Thomas Blanchard as
to the consideration upon which he is to have it, or file his
bill," &c.

560

SUPREME COURT.
Bloomer v. McQuewan ei al.

Every one must perceive the justice and propriety of this act;
under the decision now given, the assignee of Blanchard would
have had the benefit of the extension wthout paying for it.
This act, extending Blanchard's patent, was passed two yeals
after the decision of this court in Wil on v. Rousseau, which,
under the act of 1836, gave the benefit of the extension to the
assignee. This must have been known to Congress, and yet
they deemed a special provision in behalf of the assignee necessary. This act, and several others of a similar character,
cannot fail to convince every one that Congress did not suppose that the courts have power to annex a condition to a legislative grant.
In the case of Evans v. Jordan and Morehead, (9 Cranch, 199,)
this court held, that the act of January, :.808, for the relief of
Oliver Evans, does not authorize those who erected their
machinery between the expiration of their 61d patents and the
issuing of the new one, to use it after the issuing of the latter.
The above act extended the patent fourteen years, "provided
that no person who may have heretofore -jaid the said Oliver
Evans for license to use the said improvemients, shall be obliged
to renew said license or be subject to damages for not renewing"
the same; and provided also, that no person who shall have used
the said improvements, or have erected the same for ise, before
the issuing of the said patent, shall be liable to damages therefor."
This was a much stronger case for equitable considerations
than the one before us. Evans's patent had expired. His improvements were free to the public, and they were adopted by
the defendants before he made appilication to Congress for a
renewal of his patent. - I will cite the reas'ning of the Supreme
Court on that case. " The language," they say, " of this last proviso is so precise, and so entirely free from all ambiguity, that
it is difficult for any course of reasoning to shed light upon its
meaning. It protects against any claim for damages which
Evans might make, those who have used his improvements, or
who may have erected them for use, prior to the issuing of his
patent under this law. The protection is limited to acts done
prior to another act thereafter to be performed, to wit, the issuing of the patent. To extend it, by construction, to acts which
might be done subsequent to the issuing of the patent, would
be to make, not to interpret, the law." "The injustice of denying to the defendants 'the use of machinery which they had
erected after the expiration of Evans's firkt patent, and prior to
the passage of this law, has been strongly urged as a reason
why the words of this proviso should be so construed as to
have a prospective operation. But it should be recollected that

DECEMBER

TERM, 1852.

561

Bloofmer v. McQuewan et al.

the right of the plaintiff to recover damages for using his
improvement after the issuing of his patent, under this law
although it had been erected prior thereto, arises not under this
law, but under the general law of the 21st of February, 1793.
The provisos in this law profess to protect, against the operation of the general law, three classes of persons- those who had
paid Evans for a license prior to the passage of the law;. those
who may have used his improvements; and those who may have
erected them for use before the issuing of the patent."
And the court say, "The legislature might have proceeded still
further, by providing a shield for persons standing in the situation of these defendants. It is believed that the reasonableness
of such a provision could have been questioned by no one. But
the legislature have not thought proper to extend the protection
of these provisos beyond the issuing of the patent under that
law; and this court would transgress the limits of the judicial
power by an attempt to supply, by construction, this supposed,
omission of the legislature. The argument founded upon the
hardship of this and similar cases, would be entitled to great
weight if the words of this proviso were obscure and open to construction. But considerations of this nature can never sanction
a construction at variance with the manifest meaning of the
legislature, expressed in plain and an unambiguous language."
The above views do not conflict with the opinion of the court
in Evans v. Eaton, 3 Wheat. 454. In that case the court
say, "Some doubts have been entertained respecting the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, as both the plaintiff
and defendants are citizens of the same State. The fifth section of the act to promote the progress of useful arts, which
gives to every patentee a right to sue in a Circuit Court of the
United States, in case his rights be violated, is repealed by the
third section of the act of 1800, which gives the action in the
Circuit Court of the United States where a patent is granted,
Ipursuant' to that act, or to the act for the promotion of useful arts. T1,s patent, it has been said, is grapted, not in pursuance of either of those acts, but in pursuance of the act ' for
the relief of Oliver Evans.' but this court is of opinion, that
the act for the relief of Oliver Evans, is ingrafted on the general act for the promotion cf useful arts, and that the patent is
issued in pursuance of both. The jurisdiction of the court is
therefore sustained "
There can be no question that the special law extending the
grant, as to its validity, is subject to the general patent law.
The right was intended to be exclusive, if it be established that
Evans was the original inventbr of the improvements claimed,
and such improvements were stated with the necessary precision.

SUPREME COURT.
Bloomer v. McQuewan et al.

And also that it came under the class of cases on which suit
could be brought in the courts of the United States, without
regard to the citizenship of the parties. But it could not have
been intended to apply to any contract subsequent to the patent,
and it could only be held to embrace those general provisions
of the patent law which relate to the validity of the patent.
Under the act of Congress, a specification was-necessarily iled,
and it seems to be the practice to issue a patent under the act.
This, it appears to me, is unnecessary, as the grant in the act is
stifficient. But the schedule is necessary to show the nature
and extent of the claim, and these must be sustained on those
principles which apply to patents generally.
To give any other construction to the .bove remarks of the
court, would be in direct contradiction to the language used, and
the principle decided, in the case above cited from Cranch. In
fact, the remark that the relief of Evans was ingrafted on the
general law, was made in reference to th jurisdiction of the.
court and cannot be extended beyond that and other questions,
in relation to the validity of the patent.
This argument of the court, in Evans v. Jordan, applies with
all its force and authority to the case before us; and I need only
say it wdis the language of Marshall, of Story, of Washington,
and of. the other Judges of the court, except Judge Todd, who
appears to have been absent. I can add nothing to the weight
of the argument; but I will proceed to nare the Judges of this
court who have given opinions opposed to the decision of this
case by four of my brethren.
. Mr. Justice Wayne being sick, did not sit in the case. In
Wilson v. Rousseau, he held that, under the act of 1836, the
.licensee had no right to run his machine under the extended
patent.
Mr. Justice Curtis having, as counsel, given an opinion op
posed to the right of the defendants, did not sit in the case.
Mr. Justice Thompson and Mr. Justice Story had both given
opinions against the right of the assignee, unless under a special
assignment. This was the opinion of Mr. Jutice Woodbury,
as expressed in 'the case of Wilson v. Rousseau. Mr. Justice
McKinley gave an opinion against the right of the assignee
under the act of 1845, extending Woodworth's patent. The
same decision has been frequently given, by the Justices of this
bench, in the second and seventh circuits.
Sustained by the authority of seven Justices of this court,
and by an argument of the Supreme Court, above cited, which,
I think, is unanswerable, I shall deem it to be my duty to bring
the same question now decided, when it shall arise in my circuit, for the consideration and decision of a full bench.
