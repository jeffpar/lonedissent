B. BOWLER, APPELLANTS, v. THOMAS J. CHAMhBERS.
t belongs exclusively to the political department of the government to recognize or
to refuse to recognize a new government in a foreign country, claiming to have displaced the old and established a new one.
Until the political department of the government acknowledged the independence of
Texas, the Judiciary were bound to consider the old order of things as having
continued.
While the government of the United States acknowledged its treaty of limits and of
amity and friendship with Mexico as still subsisting an. obligatory, no citizen of the
.United States could lawfully furnish supplies to Texas to enable'it to carry on the
war against Mexico.
A contract, made in Cincinnati, after Texas declared itelf independent, but before
its indepe~enc was acknowledged by the United Stc.tes, whereby the complainants agreed to furnish, and did furnish money to a General in the Texan army, to
enable him to raise and equip troops to be employed against Mexico, was illegal
and void, and cannot be enforced in a court of the Unitcd States.
The circumstance that the Texan officer agreed, in consideration of these advances
of money, to convey to them certain lands in Texas, o "which he covenanted that
he'was then the owner, will not make the contract valid when it appears upon the
face dfdit, and by the averments in the bill, that the object and intention of the
complainants in advancing the money was to assist Texas in its military operations.

A contract made in the United States at that time for the purchase of land in Texas,
would have been valid even if the money was afterwards used to support hostilities
with fexico. But in this case it was not an ordinary purchase, but the object of

IN this cause lIr. histice Catronwas absent, because of indisposition, during the hearing before the court, and took no part
in the decision.
This was an appeal from the District Court of the United
States for the District of Texas.
The facts in the case are stated in the opinion of the cour.
There were several causes of demurrer filed in the court below,
but it is necessary to notice only the following, because the
decision in this court turned entirely upon them.
1. The said bill, if the facts therein were true, which is in
no sort admitted, contains no matter o.r thing of equity upon
which to ground any decree, or give the complainants any aid
or relie
2. The complainants' said bill shows no legal or valid agreement upon which to ask the aid or decree of the court; but, to
the contrary, sets out and shows an agreement which was in
violation of the neutrality of the United States towards the
Republic of Atexico in her contest with Texas.
3. The complainants' said bill seeks the aid or assistance of
the court to enforce the specific execution of an agreement made
in the State of Kentucky, between citizens thereof and this
defendant, in violation of the policy of the government of the
United States in her intercourse with foreign governments.
The demurrer was sustained generally by the-court below, and
therefore all the points were open to argument in ,thiscourt; but
it is not necessary to notice any except those upon which the
judgment of the court rested.
It was argued by Ii:r. Snherber, for the appellants, and there
was also a brief filed upon that side by i1r. L. Sherwood On
the part of the appellee it was argued by 31'r. Volney B. Howard.
Mr. Snethien contended that the neutrality and foreign policy
of the United States towards Mexico were regulated entirely by
law, which was found in the 6th section -of the act of Congress

SUP'REM1E COURT.
Xennett et al. v. Chambers.

of the 20th of April, 1818, (3 Stat. at Large, 449.) There is an
entire absence, in the contract, of all declaration or indication of"
the place or country where the propQsed military expeditions
were to be begun, or of the place whence they were to be carried
on. It will not be denied that, to subject an offender to the
pains and penalties of this section, it must be incontestably and
directly shown and proved that the "military expedition or
enterprise" which he may "begin or set on foot," or "provide or
prepare the means for," was begun or set on foot "within the
territory or jmisdiction of the United States," and was "to be
carried on from thence" against a nation with whom they were
at peace. So obvious a proposition hardly needs the weight of
authority to support it. Now the contract, proves no such offence.
The defendant may have done, and intended to have carried on,
all the acts which the complainants enabled him to do, within
and from some other country than tJ)e United States. The place
or country where the forbidden acts were done and wbhence they
were -to be carried on, cannot be inferred from the language of
the contract with any degree of certainty, and the omission cannot be supplied by any known rule of construction.
The 6th section of the act of 1818, is a penal enactment and
must be construed strictly, and the prooJ: to sustain an oflnce
against it must.be direct and positive. The contract affords not
only no such proof, but no proof at all, that the forbidden acts
were done within the United States, and to be carried on from
thence. No such offence, therefore, as that denounced by the
act, when strictly construed, having been -)roved against the parties to the contract, the contract itself consequently was not,
when made, in violation of the neutrality or foreign policy of
this countryv towards Mexico and other :nations, as established
and defined by said section and act.
The same course of argument was pursued by M11r. L. Merwood in his brief for the appellants.
1. Texas, at the time of this contract was an independent
government. And in making the contract the complainants did
not violate the laws of the United States, enacted to preserve
our neutralitywith nations with whom we were at peace, nor
did.they violate our treaty of amity with Mexico. Hence, the
contract was legal, -under the laws of the United States.
The people of Texas, represented by delegates, met in general convention at Washington, in Texas, on the 2d day of
March, 1836, and declared themselves a " Free and Independent
Republic." And then and there set thsmselves at wNork Jo

of " The Republic of Texas," under a written Constitution.
(Laws of Republic of. Texas, vol. 1, page I to 25.)
Then a new nation was born. An independent nation, th'at
maintained her independence and freedom among the nations
of the earth, and was subsequently recognized by them as possessing all the sovereignty and attributes of other nations. As
such Republic, she maintained her independence in fact and in
name, unti] she became incorporated into the government of
the United States, December 29, 1845.
The first question to be determined by this court is, -whether
Texas, at the time before stated; had the right to become, and
whether she did become an independenf government? .
That she had the right so to become, will not be doubted by
any man, nor by any court, who "hold these truths to be self
evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed
by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to
secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That
whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these
ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to
institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.'
Such right your hbnors will not doubt. It was happily incorporated in the first principles of the first truly written ilternaAmerica, the first law that is learned by the
tional law ;-in
courts or by the bar - learned generally, ere professional studies
are commenced, and imbibed almost with the first nourishment
of the American child.
That Texas, at the time to which I have referred, became entirely severed from the Republic of Mexico, is fully shown by
the reference I have made to the first volume of her laws. That
she maintaintu her independence, and was never again subjected to the dominion of Mexico, is a fact, sustained by the
history of her struggles, as well as by the history of our own
government, and other governments in their negotiations. with
her.
Althougn our government had not officially-recognized the
independence of Texas, at the date of this contract, yet, shortly
after that period, official correspondence and intercourse commenced between the United States and the Republic of Texas,
and we find a treaty negotiated between th- 4xvo governments,
as early as April, 1838. 8 Stat. at Large, 610.
It is claimed that this contract is void, as being in violation
of the laws of the United States, provided for the punishment

of persons who. shall, within the territory or jurisdiction of the
United States, "begin or set on foot, or piovide or prepare, the
means for any military expedition or enterprise, to be carried on
from thence against the territory or dominions of any foreign
prince or State, with whom the United States are at peace."
This is a penal statute, and must be construed strictly. And
I respectfully insist, that, while it is the policy of the United
States government, to preserve her neutrality between bellige.
rent nations, there is nothing in this law to prevent one of her
citizens entering into a contract with a citizen of another independent government for the purchase of land lying in that government, even though it be recited in'the contract, that it is the
intention of the person selling his lands "to use the money he
receives for them in raising and equipping volunteers to maintain
and advance the independence of his country.
.It does not appear, from the bill, that the contract was for the
advancement of funds to raise and equip volunteers within the
United States, or to carry on war from thence against Mexico.
For aught that appears, the design of General Chambers was
to raise his volunteers in Texas. And it might as well be presumed that ther were to be raised in Europe, as in the United
States.
Besides, Texas was an independent government. And the
purpose of General Chambers, as declared, was, to maintain her
independence; and not to make incursions from the United
States, or even from Texas, into Mexico.
There is nothing in this statute inhibiting a citizen of the
United States from volunteering in the service of another
.government to maintain her independence, already declared; and
uphold her government, fully instituted; nor declaring it unlawful for a citizen of the United States to contribute means for
such purposes.
Again, it is insisted by the defendant, that this contract is in
violation of, the treaty of amity, commerce ant navigation
betweeA the United States of America and the United Mexican
States, of April 5, 1832.
The 1st article of that treaty is in these words: "There
shall be a firm, inviolable, and universal pee.ce, and a true and
sincere friendship between the United States of America and
the United Mexican States, in all. the extent of their possessions
and territories,, and between their people .and citizens respectively, without distinction of persons or places."
In revolutions/ there must be a time when an old government
ends and a new one begins. And when a ,new one begins, it
must embrace a certain portion of the- earth of which it has
possession. Now with regard to this provision of the Treaty, I

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

43

Kennett et al. v. Chambers.

respectfully insist, that, by a revolution, a portion of what was
before Mexico, ceased to be any part of the possessions or territory of Mexico, and became the possessions and territory of
the new government; and that this provision in the treaty
could no longer bind the United States to regard the revolted
territory as any part of the NlIexican territory.
In regard to the obligations of this Treaty, and its binding
force upon the United S+ates, in September, 1836, the question
is not, whether the United 'ates had recognized the independence of Texas; but whether Tdxas had, in fact, achieved her
independence.
If Texas had not achieved her independence in 1836, when
this contract was executed, then she had not achieved it at a
subsequent period, when the United States government did
officially recognize her independence. And if these citizens of
Ohio, in September, 1836, violated this treaty of amity with
Mexico, then the.United States government violated the same
treaty in March, 1837, by recognizing, and in April, 1838, by
treating -with the Republic of Texas.. Fon when this contract
was made, the revolted colony had already echieved her indepen~lence, established her government, and had never relinquished any part of her territory acquired by the revolution.
The question whether Texas had achieved her independence
in September, 1836, was a historic and governmental fact--a
fact not depending upon any question of recognition by other
and'different nations.
It is true that other governments might or might not, as they
should choose, send to and receive from Texas diplomatic
agents. But whether they did or not, could nuG alter the fact
of Texan independence, so long as Mexico never repossessed
herself of the revolidpg territory. And so far as the fact of
Texan independence was concerned, it was no more the prO-vince of our government than of any other to determine when
that fact transpired. And, as I conceive, no more the 'province
of any government, than of the citizens, except so far as concerns the relations of diplomacy.
The recognition of the independence of Texas, by the United
States, in no way determined the fact as to when she became
independent, any more than did the acknowledgment of the independence of the United States by the British government,
determine the fact as to when the United States became independent. If the time or date of the independence of revolting
colonies depends on the decision of neutral nations, and not
upon the fact whether the revolting colony has established a
civil government which is continued in successful operation, performing all the functions of an independent power, -then we are

all mistaken in the date of our national existence; and instead
of celebrating the anniversary of the 4th of July, 1776, we

independence by other nations, and celebrate them. And thus,
instead of having one national holiday, we would have as many

By such a decision our boys would be delighted, and the interests of pyrotechnists greatly benefited.
31r. Voley RE Howard,for the appellees.
We insist that the bill in this case cannct be maintained, because, -

1. It is shown, on the face of the contra.ct and the bill, that
the obligation was given to enable General Chambers to raise
and equip volunteers, to carry on a war in Texas against the
republic of Mexico, and was therefore in violation of our neutrality laws with Mexico. The contract was entered into in
Ohio, in September, 1836, before this gove-mment had acknowledged the independence of Texas. Contracts to furnish money
to carry on war by revolted subjects, againt a government with
whom we are at peace, are void. 1 Kent, 116, 118, 123;, Dewentz v. Hendricks, 9 Moore, C. B. 586. If the government
does not interfere, it is illegal for citizens to do so. 1 Kent, 24,
.note A, 25, note. And, until the governnent acknowledges the
independence of the revolted province, the courts recognize the
ancient condition. of things, under which this contract would be
illegal. 1 Kent, 25; 9 Ves. 347; 4 Cranch, 272; 13 J. R. 561,
587; 3 Wheat. 324, 610; Wheaton's Elements, 453.
2. It appears from the contract, and the allegations of the
bill, on page 8 of the record, that the contract in this case was
entered into, not only for the purpose of furnishing money to
equip volunteers to carry on a war in Texas against Mexico, in
aid of the revolutionists, but for the further illegal purpose of
raising volunteers to proceed from-this country. The contract
was therefore void, as against tl.e laws cf the United States
and our treaty of amity and friendship with Mexico. The con'ract was executed in Cincinnati, on the 16th September, 1836,
and recites that General Chambers "is nou, engaged in raising,
arming, and equipping volunteers for Texas," &c. Act of Congress, 1836, p. 53; Senate Journal, 1837, pp. 110, 310; Act of

Kennett et al. v. Chambers.
The appellants filed a bill in that court against the appellee,
to obtain the specific execution of an agreement which is set
out in full in the bill; and which they allege was executed at
the city of Cincinnati, in the State of Ohio, on or about the
16th of September, 1836.
Some of the complainants claim
as original parties to the contract, and the others as assignees
of original parties, wh6 have sold and assigned to them their
interest.
The contract, after stating that it was entered into on the day
and year above mentioned, betwee'i General T. Jefferson Chamhers, of the Texan army, of the first part, and Morgan Neville
and six others, who are named in the agreement, of the city of
Cincinnati, of the second part, proceeds to recite the motives
and inducements of the parties in the following words "That the said party of the second part, being desirous of
assisting the said General T. Jefferson Chambers, who is now
engaged in raising, arming, and equipping volunteers for Texas,
and who is in want of means therefor; and, being extremely
desirous to advance the cause of freedom and the independence of Texas, have agreed to purchase of the said T. Jefferson Chambers, of his private estate, the lands hereinafter described."
And after this recital follows the agreement of Chambers, to
.ell and convey to them the land described in the agreement,
situated in Texas, for. the sum of twelve thousand five hundred
d'llars, which he acknowledged that he had received in their
notes, payable in equal instalments of four, six, and twelve
months, and he covenanted that he had a good title to this land,
and would convey it with general warranty. There are other
stipulations, on the part of Chambers, to secure the title to the
parties, which it is unnecessary to state, as they are not material to the questions before the court.
After setting out the contract at large, the bill avers, that the
notes given, as aforesaid, were all paid; and sets forth the manner in which the complainants, who were not parties to the original contract, had acquired their interest as assignees; and
charges that, notwithstanding the full payment of the money,
Chambers, under different pretexts, refuses to convey the land,
according to the terms of his agreement.
It further states, that they are informed and believe that, he
received full compensation, in money, scrip, land, or other valuable property, for the supplies furnished by him, and in arming
and equipping the Texan army referred to in the said -contract,
and which it was in part the object of the said parties of the
second part to assist him to do, by the said advances made by
them, as before stated, and which said advances did-enable the
said Chambers so to do.

SUPREME COURT.
Kennett et al. v. Chamlers

To this bill the respondent (Chambers) demurred, and the
principal question which arises on the demurrer is, whether the
contract 'was a legal and valid one, and such as can be enforced
by either party in a court of the United States. It appears on
the face of it, and by the averments of the appellants in their
bill, that it was made in Cincinnati, with-a general in the Texan
army, who was then engaged in raising, arming, and equipping
volinteers for Texas, to carry on hostilities with Mexico; and
that one of the inducements of the appellants, in entering into
this contract and advancing the money, was to assist him in
accomplishing these objects.
The District Court decided that the contract was illegal and
void, and sustained the demurrer ard dismissed the bill; and
we t.hink that the decision was right.
The validity of this contract deuends upon the relation in
which this country then stood to Mexico and Texas; and the
duties which these relations imposed upon the government and
citizens of the United States.
Texas had declared itself independent a few months previous
to this agreement. But it had not been acknowledged by the
United States; and the constituted authorities charged with our
foreign relations, regarded the/treaties we had made with lexico
as still in full force, and- obligatory upon both nations. By the
treaty of .limits, Texas had been. admitted by our government
to be a part of the Mexican territory; and by the first article of
the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, it was declared,
"that there should be a firm, inviolable, and universal peace,
and a true and sincere friendship between the United States of
America and the United Mexican States, in all the extent of
thpir possessions and territories, and between their people and
citizens respebtively, without distinction of persons or place."
These treaties, while they remained in force, were, by the Constitution of the United States, the supreme law, and binding
not only upon the government, but upoL every citizen. No
contract could lawfully be made in violation of their provisions.
Undoubtedly, when Texas had achieved her independence,
no previous treaty could bind this country "to regard it as a part
of -the Mexican territory. But it belonged to the government,
and not to individual citizens, to decide when that event had
taken place. And that decision, according to the laws of nations, depended upon the question whether she had or had not
a civil government in successful operation, capable of performing the duties aid fulfilling the obligatiors of an independent
power. It depended upon the state of the fact, and not upon
the right which was in contest between the parties. And the

DECEM1BER TERM, 1852.

President, in his message to the Senate, of December 22, 1836, in
relation, tq the conflict betwveen Mexico and Texas, which was
still pending, says: "All questions relative to the government of
foreign nations, whether of the old or the new world, have been
treated by the United States as questions of fact only, and our
predecessors have cautiously abstained from deciding upon
them until the clearest evidence was in their possession, to
enable them not only to decide correctly, but to shield their
decision from every unworthy imputation." Senate Journal of
1836, 37, p. 54.
Acting upon these principles, the independence of Texas was
not acknowledged by the. Government of the United States
until the beginning of March, 1837. Up to that time, it was
regarded as a part of the territory of Mexico. The treaty
which adm-fitted it to be so, was held to' be still in force and
binding on both parties, and every effort made by the government to fulfil its neutral obligations, and prevent our citizens
from taking part in the conflict. This is evident, from an official communication from the President to the Governor of Tennessee, in reply to an inquiry in relation to a requisition for
militia, made by General Gaines. The despatch is dated in
August, 1836; and the President uses the following language:
"The obligations of our treaty with Mexico, as well as the general principles which govern our intercourse with foreign powers,
require us to maintain a strict neutrality in the contest which
now agitates a part of that republic. So long as Mexico fulfils
her duties to us, as they are defined by the treaty, and violates
none of the rights which are secured by it to our citizens, any
act on the part of the Government of the United States, which
would tend to foster a spirit of resistance to her government
and laws, whatever may be their character or form, when administered wfihin her own limits and jurisdiction, would be unauthorized and highly improper. Ex. Doe. 1836, 1837, Vol. 1,
Doe. 2, p. 58.
And on the very day on which the agreement of which we
are speaking, was made, (September 16, 1836,) Mr. Forsyth,
the Secretary of State, in a note to*the Mexican' Minister, assured him that the -government had taken measures to secure
the execution cif the laws for preserving the .neutrality of the
United States, and that the public officers were vigilant in the
discharge of that duty. Ex Doe. Vol. 1, Doe. 2, page 63- 64.
And still later, the Presid, nt, in his message to the Senate. of
December 22, 1836, before referred to, says: "The acknowledgment of a new State as independent, and entitled to a place in
the family of nations, is at all times an act of great delicacy
and responsibility; but more especially so when such a State has

StYPREME

COURT.

forcibly separated itself from another, of which it formed an
integral part, and which still claims dominion over it." And,
after speaking of the policy which our government had always
adopted on such occasions, and the duty of maintaining the
established character of the United States for fair and impartial dealing, he proceeds to express his opinion against the acknowledgment of the independence of Texas, at that tine, in
the following words :
" It is true, with regard to Texas, the civil authority of Mexico
has -been expelled, its invading army defeated, the chief of the
republic himself captured, and all present power to control the
newly organized Government of Texas annihilated within its
confines. But, on the other hand, there is, in appearance at
least, an immense disparity of physical force on the side of
Mexico. The Mexican republic, under another executive, is
rallying its forces under a new leader, and menacing a fresh invasion to recover its lost dominion. Upon the issue of .this
threatened invasion, the independence of Texas may be considered as suspended; and, were there noihing peculiar in the
relative situation of the United States and Texas, our ackiowledgment of its independence at such a crisis would scarcely
be regarded as consistent with that prudent reserve with which
we have heretofore held ourselves bound to treat all similar
questions."
The whole object of this message appears to have been .-to
impress upon Congress the impropriety of acknowledging the
independence of Texas at that time; and the more especially
as the American character of her population, and her known
desire to become a State of this Union, might, if prematurely
acknowledged, bring suspicion upon the motives by which we
were governed.
We have given these extracts from the public documents not
only to show that, in the judgment of our 'government, Texas
had not established its independence when this contract -was
made, but to show also how anxiously the constituted authorities were endeavoring to maintain untarnished the honor of the
country, and to place it above the suspicion of taking any part
in the conffict.
This being the attitude in which the government stood, and
this its open and avowed policy, upon whit grounds can the
parties to such a contract as this, come into a court of jubtice
of the United States and ask for its specific execution? It was
made in direct opposition to the policy of the government, to
which it was the duty of every citizen to conform. And, while
they saw it exerting all its power to fulfil iagood faith its neutral obligations, they made themselves parties to the war, by

DECEB13ER TERM, 1852.

Kennett et al. v. Chambers.

furnishing means to a general of the Texan army, for the
avowed purpose of aiding and assisting him in his military
operations.
It might indeed fairly be inferred, from the language of the
contract and the statements in the appellants' bill, that the volunteers were to be raised, armed, and equipped within the limits
of the United States. The language of the contract is: "That
the said party of the second part, (that is the complainants,)
being desirous of assisting the said General T. Jefferson Chainbers, who is now engaged in raising, arming, and equipping
volunteers for Texas, and is in want of means therefor." And
as General Chambers was then in the United States, and was,
as the contract states, actually engaged at that time in raising,
arming, and equipping volunteers, and was in want of means
to accomplish his object, the inference would seem to be almost
irresistible that these preparations were making at or near the
place where the agreement was made,.and that the money was
advanced to enable him to raise and equip a military force in
the United States. And this inference is the stronger, because
no place is mentioned where these preparations are to be made,
and the agreement contains no engagement on his part, or proviso on theirs, which prohibited him from using these means and
making these military preparations within the limits of the
United States.
If this be the correct interpretation of ihe agreement, the
contract is not only void, but the parties who advanced the
money were liable to be punished in a criminal prosecution, for
a violation of the neutrality laws of the United States. And
certainly, with such strong indications of a criminal intent, and
without any averment in the bill from which their innocence
can be inferred, a court of chancery would never lend its aid
to carry the agreement into specific execution, but would leave
the parties to seek their remedy at law. And this ground would
of itself' be sufficient to justify the decree of the District Court
dismissing the bill.
But the decision stands on broader and firmer ground, and
this agreement cannot be sustained either at law or in equity.
The question is not whether the parties to this contract violated

at that time, within the United States, for the purposes stated
in the contract and the bill of complaint, was a legal and -valid
contract, and such as to entitle either party to the aid of the
courts of justice of the United States to enforce its execution.

tt et al. v. Chambers.

United States in the h,rds of the government, and its decisions
upon these subjects a - obligatory upor. every citizen of the
Union. He is bound t6 be at war with the nation against which
the war-making power has -declared war, and equally bound to
commit no act of hostility against a nation with which the government is in amity and friendship. This principle is universally acknowledged by the laws of nations. It lies at the foundation of all government, as there could be no social order or
peaceful relations between the citizens of different countries
without it. It is, however, more emphatically true in relation to
citizens of the United States. For as the sovereignty resides
in the people, every citizen is a portion of it, and is himself personally bound by the laws which the representatives of the sovereignty may pass, or the treaties into which they may enter,
within the scope of their delegated authority. And when that
authority has plighted its faith to another :nation that there shall
be peace and friendship between the citizens of the two countries, every citizen of the United States is equally and personally pledged. The compact .is made by the department of the
government upon which he himself has agreed to confer the
power. It is his own personal compact as a portion of the sovereignty in whose behalf it is made. And he can, do no act,
nor enter into any agreement to promote or encourage revolt ol
hostilities againsf the territories of a cot.ntry with which our
government is pledged by treaty to be at peace, without a breach
of his duty as a citizen, and the breach of the faith pledged to
the foreign nation. And if he does so he cannot claim the aid
of a court of justice to enforce it. The appellants say, in their
contract, that they were induced to advance the money by the
desire to promote the cause of freedom. 'But our own freedom
cannot be preserved without obedience to our own laws, nor
social order preserved if the judicial branch of the government
countenanced and sustained contracts made in violatign of the
duties which the law imposes, or in contravention of the known
and established policy of the political department, acting within
the limits of its constitutional power.
But it has been urged in the argument that Texas was in fact
independent, and a sovereign state at the time of this agreement;
and that the citizen of a neutral nation mnar lawfully lend money
to one that is engaged in war, to enable it'to carry on hostilities
against its enemy.
It is not necessary, in the case before us, to decide, how far the
judicial tribunals of the United States would cnforce a contract
like this, when two, states, acknowledged to be independent,
were at war, and this country neutral. It is a sufficient answer
to the argument to say that the question whether Texas had or

Kennett et al. v. Chambers.

had not at that time become an independent state, was a question for that department of our government exclusively which is
charged with our foreign relations. And until the period when
that department recognized it as an independent state, the
judicial tribunals of the country were bound to consider the old
order of things as having continued, and to regard Texas as a
part of the Mexican territory. And if we undertook to inquire
whether she had not in fact become an independent sovereign
state before she was recognized as such by the treaty-making
power, we should take upon ourselves the exercise of political
authority, for which a judicial tribunal is wholly unfit, and which
the Constitution has conferred exclusively upon another department.
This is not a new question. It came before the court in the
case of Rose v. Himely, 4 Cr. 272, and again in Hoyt v. Gelston, 3 Wheat. 324. And in both of these cases the court.said,
that it belongs exclusively to governments to recognize new
states in the revolutions which may occur in the world; and
until such recognition, either by our own government or the government to which the new state belonged, courts of justice are
bound to consider the :ancient state of things as remaining
unaltered.
It was upon this ground that the Court of Common Pleas in
England, in the case of De Wutz v. Hendricks, 9 Moore's C. B.
Reports, 586, decided that it was contrary to the law of nations
for persons residing in England to enter int9 engagements to
raise money by way of loan for the purpose of supporting subjects of a foreign state in arms against a government in friendship with England, and that no right of action attached upon
any such contract. And this decision is quoted with ar'robation by Chancellor Kent, in 1 Kent's Coin. 116.
Nor can the subsequent acknowledgment of the independence
of Texas, and her admission into the Union as a sovereign State,
affect the question. The agreement being illegal and, absolutely
void at the time it was made, it ran derive no force -or validity
from events which afterwards happened.
But it is insisted, on the part of the appellants, that this contract was to be executed in Texas, and was valid by the laws
of Texas, and that the District Court for that State, in a controversy between individuals, was bound to administer the laws
of the State, and ought therefore to have enforced this agreement.
This argument is founded in part on a mistake of the fact.
The contract was not only made in Cincinnati, but all the stipulations on the part of the appellants were to be performed there.
and not in Texas. And the advance of money which they

Wiswall v. Sampson.

agreed to make for military purposes was in fact made and intended to be made in Cincinnati, by the delivery of their promissory notes, which were accepted by the appellee as payment
of the money. This appears on the face of the contract. And
it is this advance of money for the purposes mentioned in the
agreement, in contravention of the neutral obligations and policy
of the United States, that avoids the contract. The mere agreement to accept a conveyance of land lying in Texas, for a valu'able consideration paid by them, would have b&en free from
objection.
But- had the fact been otherwise, certainly no law of Texas
then or now in force could absolv& a citizen of the United States,
while he continued such, from his duty to this government, nor
compel a court of the United States to support a contract, no
matter where made or where to be executed, if that contract was
in violation of their laws, or contravened the public policy of
the government, or was in conflict with subsistihg treaties with
a foreign nation.
We therefore hold this contract to be illegal and voidl, and
affirm the decree of the District Couir

Order.
This cause came on to be beard on the transcript of the record
from the District Court of the United States for the District of
Texas, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof it
is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court, that
the decree of the said District Court in this cause be, and the
same is hereby, affirmed with costs.
