becomes necessary, on account of the difference in the modes
of proceeding and practice in the different circuits. This question cannot arise in England, as the time for appeal runs two
years from the enrolment of the decree. (3 Dan. Pr., 131.)
The time of enrolment cannot well be adopted by this court,
as on many of the circuits it is understood, according to the
practice, no enrolment of the decree takes place.
As, upon our view of th6 case, presented on the motion, the
first appeal was regular, the one taken and standing on the
docket No. 106 should be dismissed.

The admiralty jurisdiction of the courts of the United States extends to cases of
collision upon navigable waters, although the place of such collision may be
within the body of a county of a State, and may be above the flux and reflux of
the tide.
The District Courts exercise this jurisdiction over fresh-water rivers "navigable
from the sea," by virtue of the judiciary act of 1789, and not as conferred by the
act of 1845, which extends their jurisdiction to the great lakes and waters "not
navigable from the sea."

THIs was an appeal from the District Court of the United
States for the middle district of Alabama.
The case came up on an appeal from the judgment of the
District Court, dismissing the libel for want of jurisdiction,
after the following agreement had been filed:
Be it remembered, that on the trial of this cause, which was
a libel in admiralty, it was agreed that the question of jurisdiction should be submitted to the court on the facts hereinafter stated, which were admitted to be true; and if the court
should be of the opinion that the court had jurisdiction of the
cause, then the cause should be submitted to a jury for trial.
But if the court should be of opinion that it was without jurisdiction, the"libel would be dismissed, and in the event an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States,
and the judgment of that court should reverse the judgment
of this court, then the cause should be remanded to this court
for trial.
The court agreed so to try the question of jurisdiction on
the facts, which are admitted to be as follows: The steamboat
Wetumpka was a vessel engaged in navigation and commerce

between the port of New Orleans, in Louisiana, and the port
of Montgomery, in Alabania, and was regularly licensed and
enrolled as a coasting vessel, and was of more than thirty tons
burden. The steamboat Magnolia was a boat regularly licensed
and enrolled for the coasting trade, but was built for a packet
boat to be employed between Mobile, Alabama, and Montgomery, Alabama. She was built in the Western country, and
brought round to this State, and has ever since been engaged
in running between Mobile and Montgomery, and has never
been engaged in any other trade.
The collision, which is the subject of the libel against the
Ma-nolia, took place between her and the Wetumpka. 'on the
Ala ama river, about two. hundred miles above tide-water.
The Magnolia is a boat of over thirty tons burden. The foregoing are the ficts in which the question of jurisdiction is
submitted to the court, together with the libel and claim, and
answer thereto.

SEMILE,

For the Libellants.
The case was argued at the preceding term of this court upon
printed arguments by Mr. FrancisLee Smith for the appellants,
and lXr. Jargan for the appellees; also orally by Mr. Phillips
for the appellees.
The difficulty of abbreviating arguments made by counsel
upon constitutional points, and the circumstance that both
sides of the question of jurisdiction are fully presented in the
opinion of the court and in the dissenting opinions of Mr.
Justice DANIEL and Mr. Justice CAMPBELL, are reasons
why the Reporter omits sketches of the arghments of counsel.
It will be perceived, also, that Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered
a separate opinion, although concurring in the judgment of the
court.
Mr. Jxustice GRIER deliveredthe opinion of the court.
The only question presented for our consideration on this
appeal is, whether the court below had jurisdiction.
The libel purports to be in a cause of collision, civil and
maritime. It alleges that the steamboat Wetumpka, a vessel
of three hundred tons burden, was on a voyage from New
Orleans to the city of Montgomery, in Alabama; that while
ascending the Alabama river, she was run into-and sunk by
the steamboat Magnolia, which was descending the same.
The answer of the respondents, among other things, alleges
"that the collision took place far above tide-water, on the

298

SUPREME COURT.
Jackson et al. v. Steamboat Magnolia.

Alabama river, in the county of Wilcox, in the State of Alabama, and therefore not within the jurisdiction of the District
Court sitting in admiralty."

This plea was sustained by the court, and the libel dismissed.
The record does not disclose the reasons on which this judgment was based. It is presumed, therefore, to be founded on
the facts stated in the plea, viz:
1. That the collision was within the body of a county.
2. That it was above tide-water.
1. The Alabama river flows through the State of Alabama.
It is a great public river, navigable from the sea for many miles
above the ebb and flow of the tide. Vessels licensed for the
coasting trade, and those engaged in foreign commerce, pass
on its waters to ports of entry within the State. It is not, like
the Mississippi, a boundary between coterminous States. Neither is it, like the Penobscot, (see Veazie v. Moore, 14 How.,
568,) made subservient to the internal trade of the State by
artificial means and dams constructed at its mouth, rendering
it inaccessible to sea-going vessels. It differs from the Hudson, which rises in and passes through the State of New York,
in the fact that it is navigable for ships and vessels of the largest
class far above where its waters are affected by the tide.
Before the adoption of the present Constitution, each State,
in the exercise of its sovereign power, had its own court of
admiralty, having jurisdiction over the harbors, creeks, inlets,
aud public navigable waters, connected with the sea. This
jurisdiction was exercised not only over rivers, creeks, and inlets, which were boundaries to or passed through other States,
but also where they were wholly within the State. Such a
distinction was unknown, nor (as it appears from the decision
of this court in the case of Waring v. Clark, 5 How., 441) had
these courts been driven from the exercise of jurisdiction over
torts committed on navigable water within the body of a county,
by the jealousy of the common-law courts.
When, therefore, the exercise, of admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction over its public rivers, ports, and havens, was surrendered by each State to the Government of the United States,
without an exception as to subjects or places, this court can
not interpolate one into the Constitution, or introduce an arbitrary distinction which has no foundation in reason or precedent.
The objection to jurisdiction stated in the plea, "that the
collision was within the county of Wilcox, in the State of Alabama," can therefore have no greater force or effect from the
fact alleged in the argument, that the Alabama river, so far as
it is navigable, is wholly within the boundary of the State.

DECEMBER TERM, 1857.

299

.acmon et at. v. Steamboat Mtagnolia.

It amounts only to a renewal of the old contest between
courts of common law and courts of admiralty, as to their jurisdiction within the body of a county. This question has
been finally adjudicated in this court, and the argument exhausted, in the case of Waring v. Clark. After an experience
of ten years, we have not been called on by the bar to review
its principles as founded in error, nor have we heard of any
complaints by the people of wrongs suffered on account of its
supposed infringement of the right of trial by jury. So far,
therefore, as the solution of the question now before us is affected by the fact that the tort was committed within the body
of a county, it must -beconsidered as finally settled by the decision in that case.
2. The second ground of objection to the jurisdiction of the
court is founded on the fact, that though the collision com-

plained of occurred in a great navigable river; it was on a part
of that river not affected by the flux and reflux of the. tide, but
"far above it.
This objection, also, is one which has heretofore been considered and decided by this court, after full argument and much
deliberation. In the case of the Genesee Chief, (12 How.,
444,) we have decided, that though in England the flux and
reflux of the tide was a sound and reasonable test of a navigable river, because on that island tide-water and navigable
water were synonymous terms, yet that "there is certainly
nothing in the ebb and flow of the tide that makes the waters
peculiarly suitable for admiralty jurisdiction, nor anything in
the absence of a tide that renders it unfit. If it is a public navigable water on which commerce is carried on between different States or nations, the reason for the jurisdiction is precisely
the same. And if a distinction is made on that account, it is
merely arbitrary, without any foundation in reason-and, indeed, contrary to it.", The case of the Thomas Jefferson (10
Wheaton) and others, which had hastily adopted this arbitriry
and (in this country) false test of navigable waters, were necessarily overruled.
Since the decision of these cases, the several district courts
have taken jurisdiction of cases of collision on the great public
navigable rivers. Some of these cases have been brought to
this court by appeal, and in no instance has any objection been
taken, either by the counsel or the court, to the jurisdiction,
because the collision was within the body of a county, or above
the tide. (See Fritz.v. Bull, 12 How., 466 ; Walsh v. Rogers,
13 How., 283; The Steamboat New World, 16 How., 469; 'Ure
v. "lauffman, 19 How., 56; New York and Virginia S. B. Co.
v. Calderwood, 19 How., 245.)

300

SUPREME COURT.
."ackson etal. v.Steamboat Magnolia.

In our opinion, therefore, neither of the facts alleged in the
answer, nor both of them taken together, will constitute a sufficient exception to the jurisdiction of the District Court.
It is due however, to the learned counsel who has presented
the argument for iespondent in this case, to say, that he has
not attempted to impugn the decision ot this court in the case
of Waring v.Clark, nor to question the sufficiency of the reasons
given in the case of the Genesee Chief for overruling the case
of the Thomas Jefferson; but he contends that the case of the
Genesee Chief decided that the act of Congress of 1845, "extending the jurisdiction of the District Court to certain cases
'upon the lakes," &c., was not only constitutional, but also that
it conferred a new jurisdiction, which the court did not possess
before; and consequently, as that act was confined to the lakes,
and "to vessels of twenty or more tons burden, licensed and
employed'in the business of commerce and navigation between
ports and places in different States and Territories," it cannot
authorize the District Courts in assuming jurisdiction over
waters and subjects not included in the act, and more especially
where the navigable portion of the river is wholly within the
boundary of a single State. it is contended als.o that the case
of Fritz v. Bull, and those which follow it, sustaining the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty over torts on the Mississippi
river, cannot be reconciled with the points decided in the former case, as just stated, unless on the hypothesis that the act
of 1845 be construed to include the Mississippi and other great
rivers of the West; which it manifestly does not.
But it never has been asserted by this court, either in the
case of Fritz v. Bull, or in any other case, that the admiralty
jurisdiction exercised over the great navigable rivers of the West
was claimed under the, act of 1845, or by virtue of anything
therein contained.
The Constitution, in defining the powers of the courts of the
United States, extends them to "all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction." It defines how much of the judicial power
shall be exercised by the Supreme Court only; aAd it was left
to Congress to ordain and establish other courts, and to fix the
boundary and extent of their respective juris dictions. Congress might give any of these courts the whole or so much of
the admiralty jurisdiction as it saw fit. It might extend their
jurisdiction over all navigable waters, and all ships and vessels thereon, or over some navigable waters, and vessels of a
certain description only. Consequently, as Congress had never
before 1845 conferred admiralty jurisdiction over the lNorthern
fresh-water lakes not "navigable from the sea," the District
Courts could not assume it by virtue of this clause in the Con-

DECEMIBER TERM, 1857.

801

Jckhon et al. v. Steamboat Magnolia.

stitution. An act of Congress was therefore necessary to confer this jurisdiction on those waters, and was completely within
the constitutional powers of Congress; unless, by some unbending law of nature, fresh-water lakes and rivers are necessarily within the category of those that are not "navigable,"
and which, consequently, could not be subjected to "admiralty
jurisdiction," any more .than canals or railroads.
When these States were colonies, and for a long time after
the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, the
shores of the great lakes of the NWorth, above and beyond the
ocean tides, were as yet almost uninhabited, except by savages.
The necessities of commerce and the progress of steam navigation had not as yet called for the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction, except on the ocean border of the Atlantic States.
The judiciary act of 1789, in defining the several powers of
the courts established by it, gives to the District Coarf of the
United States "exclisive original cognizance of all civil cases
of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, including all seizures,
&c., when they are made on waters which are navigable from
the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burden, &c,, as well as
upon the high seas."
So long as the commerce of the country was centred chiefly
on the Eastern Atlantic ports, where the fresh-water rivers
were seldom navigable above tide-water, no inconvenience
arose from the adoption of the English insular test of "navigable waters." Hence it was followed by the courts without
objection or inquiry.
But this act does not confine admiralty jurisdiction to tidewaters; and if the flux and reflux of the tide be abandoned, as
an arbitrary and false test of a "navigable river," it required
no further legislation of Congress to extend it to the Mississippi, Alabama, and other great rivers, "navigrable from the
sea." If the waters over which this jurisdiction is claimed
be within this category, the act makes no distinction between
them, It is not confined to rivers or waters which 'bound
coterminous States, such as the Mississippi and Ohio, or to
rivers passing through more than one State; nor does the act
distinguish between them and rivers which rise in and pass
through one State only, and are consequently "infra corpus
comitatis." The admiralty jurisdiction surrendered by the
States to the Union had no such bounds as exercised by themselves, and is clogged with no such conditions in its surrender.
The interpolation of such conditions by the courts would exclude many of the'ports, harbors, creeks, and inlets, most frequented by ships and cominerce but which are wholly included
within the boundaries of a State or the body of a county.

302

SUPREME COURT.
,Tackson et al. v.Steamboat Magnolia.

It seems to have been assumed, in the argument of this case,
that because the District Courts had not exercised their admi
ralty jurisdiction above tide-water before the decision of this
court of the case of the Genesee Chief, that such jufisdiction
had been exercised by them as conferred by the act of 1845.
It is upon this mistaken hypothesis that any difficulty is found
in reconciling that case with the case of Fntz v. Bull, which
immediately followed it.
The act of 1845 was the occasion and created the necessity
for this court to review their former decisions.
It might be considered in fact as a declaratory act reversing
the decision in the case of the Thomas Jeffirson. We coul
no longer .evade the question by a judicial notice of an occult
tide without ebb or flow, as in the case of Peyroux v. Howard,
(7 Pet., 848.) The court were placed in the position, that they
must either declare the act of Congrcss void, and shock the
common sense of the people by declaring the lakes not to be
"navigable waters," or overrule previous decisions which had
established an arbitrary distinction, which, when applied to
our continent, had no foundation in reason.
In conclusion, we repeat what we then said, that "courts of
admiralty have 'been found necessary in all commercial countries, not only for the safety and convenience of commerce, and
a speedy decision of controversies where delay would be ruin,
but also to administer the laws of nations in a season of war,
and to determine the validity of captures and questions of
prize or no prize in a judicial proceeding. And it would be
contrary to the first principles on which this Union was
formed, to confine these rights to the States bordering on
the Atlantic, and to the tide-water rivers connected with
it, and to deny them to the citizens who border on the
lakes, and the great navigable streams of the Western States.
Certainly, such was not the intent of the framers of the Constitution; and if such be the construction finally given to it
by this court, it must necessarily produce great public inconvenience, and at the same time fail to accomplish one of the
great objects of the framers of the Constitution; that is, perfect equality in the rights and privileges of the citizens of the
different States, not only in the laws of the General Government, but in the mode of administering them."
The decree of the court below, dismissing the libel for want
of jurisdiction, is therefore reversed, and it is ordered that
the record be remitted, with directions to further proceed in
the case as to law and justice may appertain.
Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered a separate opinion, and Mr.

Justice CATROlN, Mr. Justice DA1TIEL, and Mr. Justice
CAMPBELL, dissented. Mr. Justice CATROlN concurred
with Mr. Justice CAMPBELL in the opinion delivered by
him.
Mr. Justice McLEAT:
I agree to the decision in this case; but as I wish to be on
one or two points somewhat more explicit than the opinion
of the court, I will concisely state my views.
The Constitution declares that the judicialpower shall extend "to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction."
The judiciary act of 1789 provides, "that the District Courts
shall have exclusive original cognizance of all civil cases of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction."
The act of the 25th February, 1845, is entitled "An act to
extend the jurisdiction of the District Courts to certain cases
upon the lakes and navigable waters connecting with the
same." This act was considered by Congress as extending...
the jurisdiction -of the District Court; and it was so, very
properly, treated by the court in the case of the Geuiesee Chief.
In the opinion, it.was said this act was not passed under the
commercial power, but under the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction given in the Constitution. No terms could be more
complete than those used in the Constitution to confer this
jurisdiction. In all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdic.
.
tion, such suits may be brought in the District Court.
This jurisdiction was limited in England to the ebb and flow
of the tide, as their rivers were Iavigable only as far as the
tide flowed. And as in this country the rivers falling into the
Atlantic were not navigable above tide-water, the same' rule
was applied. And when the question of jurisdiction was first
raised in regard to our Western rivers, the same rule was
adopted, when there was no reason for its restriction to tides.
water, as in the rivers of the Atlantic. And this shows that
the most-learned and able judges may, from the force of precedent, apply an established rule where the reason or necessity
on which it was founded fails.
In England and in the Atlantic States, the ebb and flo*v of
the tide marked the extent of the navigableness of rivers. But
the navigability of our Western rivers in no instance depends
upon the tide.
By the civil law, the maritime system extends over all navigable waters. The admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, like
the common-law or, chancery jurisdiction, embraces a system of procedure known and established for ages. It may be
called a system of regulations embodied and matured by the
-

most enlightened and commercial nations of the world. Its
origin may be traced to the regulations of Wisbuy, of the
Ianse Towns, the laws of Oleron, the ordinances of France,
and the usages of other commercial countries, including the
English admiralty.'
It is, in fact, a regulation of commerce, as it comprehends
the duties and powers of masters of vessels, the maritime liens
of seamen, of those who furnish supplies to vessels; make advances, &c., and, in short, the knowledge and conduct .required
of pilots, seamen, masters, and everything pertaining to the
sailing and management of a ship. As the terms import, these
regulations apply to the water, and not to the land, and are
commensurate with the jurisdiction conferred.
By the Constitution, "Congress have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and
with the Indian tribes." The provision, "among the several
States," limits the power of Congress in the regulation of commerce to two or more States; consequently, a State has power
to regulate a commerce exclusively within its own limits; but
beyond such limits the regulation belongs to Congress. The
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is essentially a commercial
power, and it is necessarily limited to the exercise of that
power by Congress.
Every voyage of a vessel between two or more States is
subject to the admiralty jurisdiction, and not to any State regulation. A denial of this doctrine is a subversion of the commercial power of Congress, and throws us on the Confederation. It also subverts the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction
of the Federal courts, given explicitly in the Constitution and
in the judiciary act of 1789.
In this case, the steamboat Wetumpka was engaged in a
commerce between New Orleans, in Louisiana, and Montgomery, in Alabama. The Magnolia was running between
Mobile and Montgomery, in the State of Alabama. The Wetumpka, within the State of Alabama, was as much under the
Federal jurisdiction as it was in the State of Louisiana. No
one will contend that one. State may regulate the commerce
of another; nor can it be maintained that the power to regulate the commerce of the Wetumpka in this case was in either
State. It was a commerce between the two States, which
comes within the definition of commerce expressly given to
Congress. While thus protected and regulated by the power
of Congress, the Wetumpka was run into by the Magnolia, and
sunk, in the Alabama river; and it is earnestly contended that
the admiralty can give no remedy for this aggravated trespass.
Since the decision in the case of the Genesee Chief by seven

DEO0EMBER TERM, 1857.
.Tacaon et al. v. Steamboat .agnolia.

judges, only one dissenting, the admiralty jurisdiction has
been constantly applied on all our lakes and rivers of the NVorth;
and some of the cases have been reviewed in this court without objection. .The navigators of the Alabama river must
have been more prudent and skilful than those of the North,
or their voyages were less frequent, if the above collision is
the first that has occurred on the Alabama river.
It is true, the Magnolia was engaged in a commerce strictly
within the State; but this does not exonerate her, as the trespass was on a vessel protected by the admiralty law. Cases
have frequently occurred on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers,
where steamboats, having run down and sunk flat-boats,
were held responsible for the injury in the admiralty. And if
a steamer is liable in such cases, a remedy for an injury done
to it cannot be withheld in the same court.
In the Genesee Chief case, (12 How., 443,) this e6urt held:
"The admiralty jurisdiction granted to the District Courts of
the United States under the Constitution extends to the navigable rivers and lakes of the United States, without regard to
the ebb and flow of the tides of the ocean." It is.difficult to
perceive how this language could have been mistaken, as alleged by the counsel in argument. All the lakes and all the
navigable rivers in the UnIon are declared to be subjectto this
jurisdiction without reference to the tide, and it overrules all
previous decisions on that subject.
It was said in that case the act of 1845 extended the jurisdiction of the admiralty; and this was so, as by the act of 1789
it was limited to rivers navigable from the sea by vessels of ten
tons burden and upwards.
It is alleged that the assumption of this jurisdiction will absorb matters of controversy and the punishment of offences
and misdemeanors now cognizable in the courts of the State,
without the trial by jury, and before a foreign tribunal, contrary to the wishes and interests of a State.
The admiralty and maritime jurisdiction has been in operation on all the navigable rivers of our Atlantic coast since the
organization of the Government, and its exercise has not been
found dangerous or inconvenient. Experience is a better rule
of judgment than theory. If this jurisdiction has been found
salutary in that part of our country which is most commercial,
it cannot be injurious or dangerous in those parts which are
less commercial.
The Federal courts have no cognizance of common-law offences, on the land or on the water. Jurisdiction 'has been
conferred on them of common law and chancery in specified
cases, in every State and Territory of the Union; but I am not
VOL. XX.

aware that this has been considered a foreign jurisdiction, or
one that has been dangerous to the people of any State. Occasional conflicts of jurisdiction have arisen between this tribunal and the State courts, to preserve the rights guarantied
by the Federal Constitution; but this became necessary in
maintenance of the fundamental law of the Union. And if
Congress should deem it necessary for the regulation of our
internal commerce, amounting to more than ten hundred millions of dollars annually, to enact laws for its protection, they
will no doubt be as mindful of the rights of the States as of
those who, by their enterprise and wealth, carry on the commerce of the country.
Every one knows how strenuously the admiralty jurisdiction
was resisted in England by the common-law lawyers, headed
by Coke. The contest lasted for two centuries. The admiralty civilians contended that the statutes of Richard H-and 2
H. IV did not curtail the ancient jurisdiction of the admiralty
over torts and injuries upon the high sehs, and in ports within
the ebb and flow of the tide, which was shown by an exposition of the ancient cases, as was opposed by the common-law
courts; but they continued the contest until they acquired a
concurrent jurisdiction over all maritime causes, except prize.
The vice-admiralty courts in this country, under the colonial
Government, exercised jurisdiction over all maritime contracts,
and over torts and injuries, as well in ports as upon the high
seas, and this was the jurisdiction conferred on our courts by
the Constitution.
But it was not until a late period that the jurisdiction of the
admiralty in England was settled by the statute of 8 and 4 Victoria, c. 67, passed in 1840. This is entitled "An act to improve the practice and extend the jurisdiction of the High Court
of Admiralty in England." And it is gratifying to the bar and
bench of this country to know, that the above statute has
placed the English admiralty substantially on the same footing
that it is maintained in this country. To this remark it is believed there are but two or three exceptions. Insurance, ransom, and surveys, are believed to constitute the only exceptions. The flow of the tide, as before remarked, is used to
designate the navigableness of their rivers. Whether an insurance is within the admiralty, has not been considered by
this court. It is singular, that while the English admiralty, by
its extension, has been placed substantially upon the same
basis as our own, ours should be denounced as having a dangerous tendency upon our interests and institutions, and a
desire expressed to abandon the enlightened rules of the civil
law, and follow the misconstrued statutes of Richard I.

Antiquity has its charms, as it is rarely found in the common walks of professional life; but it maybe doubted whether
wisdom is not more frequently found in experience and the
gradual progress of human affirs; and this is especially the
case in all systems of jurisprudence which are matured by the
progress of human knowledge. Whether it be common, chancery, or admiralty law, we. should be more instructed by studying its present adaptations to human concerns, than to trace it
back'to its beginnings. Every one is more interested and delighted to look upon the majestic and flowing river, than by
following its current upwards until it becomes lost in its mountain rivulets.
Mr. Justice DANIEL dissenting:
Against the opinion of the court in this cause, and the doctrines assumed in its support. I feel constrained solemnly to
protest.
If in the results which have heretofore attended repeated
efforts on my part to assert what are regarded both as the
sacred authority of the Constitution and the venerable dictates
of the law were to be sought the incentive to this remonstrance, this act might' appear to be without motive; for it
cannot be denied that to earnest and successive remonstrances
have succeeded still wider departures from restrictions previously recognised, until in the-case before.us every limit upon
power, save those which judicial discretion or the propensity
of the court may think proper to impose, is now cast aside.
But it is fel~t that in the discharge of official obligation there
may be motives much higher than either the prospect or the
attainment-of success can supply; and it may be accepted
as a moral axiom, that he who,' under convictions of duty,
cannot steadily oppose his exertions, though feeble and unaided, to the march of power, when believed to be wrongful,
however overshadowing it may appear, must be an unsafe depositary of either public or private confidence. My convictions
pledge me to an unyielding condemnation of pretensions once
denominated, by a distinguished member of this court, -"the
silent and stealing progress-of the admiralty in acquiring jurisdiction to which it has no.pretensions;" and still more inflexibly of the fearful and tremendous assumptions of power
now openly proclaimed for tribunals pronounced by the venerable Hale, by Coke, anad by Blackstone, and by the authorities
avouched for their opinions, to have been merely tolerated by,
and always 4ubordinate to, the authority of the common lawan usurpation licensed to overturn the most inveterate principles of that law; licensed in its exercise to invade the jurisdic-.

tion of sovereign communities, and to defy and abrogate the
most vital immunities of their social or political organization.
I cannot, without a sense.of delinquency, omit any occasion
of protesting against what to my mind is an abuse of the greatest magnitude, and one which, hopeless as at present the prospect of remedy may appear, it would seem could require
nothing but attention to its character and tendencies to insure
a corrective. It must of necessity be resisted in practice, as
wholly irreconcilable with every guarantee of the rights of
person or property, or with the power of internal police in the
States.
Having, in cases formerly before this court, (vid. 6 How., p.
395 et seq.,-New Jersey Steam Navigation Company v. Merchants' Bank; 10 How., p. 607, Kewton v. Stebbins; 12 How.,
465, Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh; 18 ]ow., p. 269, Ward v.
Peck;) traced with some care the origin of the admiralty jurisdiction in England, and the modes and limits to which that
jurisdiction was there subjected, no farther reference will here
be made to the authorities by which that investigation has
been guided, than is necessary to illustrate the origin and extent of the like jurisdiction as appertainin," to the tribunals of
the United States. Amongst the novelties which are daily
brought to notice, it would not awaken very great surprise to
hear it contended, in the support of a favorite theory or posision, that the admiralty courts of England were not governed
by the laws and ordinances of that country, or in effect that
England did not govern herself; but has been, and still is,
controlled by some foreign or extraneous authority. Something not unlike this strange idea has, on more than one occasion, been intimated; and with respect to her colonies,
strictly Pubordinate as they are known to have ever been in
political and legislative power to the mother country, it has been
broadly asserted that these have been released fim the restrictions upon the admiralty in the mother country, whilst this
emancipation is coupled with the incongruous position that
they (and the United States, as once forming a portion of those
colonies) are more or less subject to the admiralty regulations
of every petty community-in the world. I-am constrained to
repel such an argument, if argument it can be called, as consonant neither with reason nor historical accuracy. The only
known difference between the administration in admiralty
courts in the mother country and in her American colonies,
was created by express statute, with reference to the revenue;
was limited to the single regulation prescribed by the statute;
and has, by every writer upon the subject, been treated as a
special direction, applicable solely to the matter of which it

treated, an&as neither entering into, nor deducible from, any
regular and constitutional attribute of the admiralty jurisdiction. It was an exception, an anomaly, and in ' its nature and
operation was unique and solitary. Of the 'same character,
precisely, is the provision of the eleventh section of the judiciary act of 1789, which invests the District Courts with jurisdiction in cases of seizure under the laws of imposts of the
United States. This provision confers, in, the first place, in
general terms; without limitation, on the District Courts, admiralty and maritime,jurisdiction. So far, then, as it was the
purpose to constitute these tribunals courts of admiralty, the
jurisdiction conferred by the language of the act just quoted
was complete. The District Courts were thereby created courts
of admiralty to all intents and purposes; but the section goes
on to add to the powers of-the District Courts, the cognizance
of other subjects not regularly appertaining to the jurisdiction
of the admiralty, viz: of seizures under the laws of imposts; subjects belonging to a class which was in England peculiarly
cognizable in the court of exchequer, and under the authority
and process of the common law.
The conclusion, then, from the eleventh section of the judiciary act, is inevitably this: that the power thereby vested with
respect to seizures, is not an admiralty power-was never conferred by the investment of admiralty power in accordance with
the Constitution; bui is in its character distinct therefrom,
and is peculiar and limited in its extent. Such appears to have
been the opinion of two distinguished commentators upon the
admiralty jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States, Chancellor Kent and Mr. Dane; the former of whom, in the 1st vol.
of his Commentaries, p. 876, holds this language: "Congress
had a right, in their discretion, to make all seizures and. forfeitures cognizable in the District Courts; but it may be a question whether they had any right to declare them to be cases
of admiralty jurisdiction, if they were not so by the law, of the
land when the Constitution was made. The Constitution secures to the citizen trial by jury in all criminal prosecutions,
and in all civil suits at common law where the value in controversy exceeds twenty dollars. These prosecutions for forfeitures of large and valuable portions of property, under the
revenue laws, are highly penal in their consequences; and the
Government and its oicers are always parties, and deeply concerned in the conviction and forfeiture. And if, by act of
Congress or by judicial decisions, the prosecution can be turned
over to the admiralty side of the District Court, as being neither a criminal prosecution nor a suit at common law, the trial
of the cause is then transferred from a jury of the country to

810

the breast of a single judge. It is probable, however that the
judiciary act did not intend to do more than to declare the jurisdiction of the District Courts over these cases; and that all
the prosecutiofs for penalties and forfeitures upon seizures under laws of imposts, navigation, and trade, were not to be considered of admiralty jurisdiction when the case admitted of a
prosecution at common law; for the act saves to suitors in all
cases the right to a common-law remedy, where the common
law was competent to give it. We have seen that it is competent

penalties, was much discussed and complained of at the commehcement of the Revolution." Judge Conkling also, in his
Treatise on the Admiralty, vol. 2, p. 391, says: "In England,
all revenue seizures are cognizable exclusively in the exchequer;
and such of them as are coagnizable on the admiralty side of
the District Courts of the 5 nited States are made so only by
force of a legislative act."
From the above exposition of the jurisdiction of the viceadmiralty courts in the British colonies' it-is manifest that
neither by custom nor practice, nor by positive enactment, has
there ever been created in those courts any power or jurisdiction appertaining to their character and constitution strictly as
courts of admiralty, which they did not derive regularly by their
commission from the Lord High Admiral. Brown, in his Civil
and Admiralty Law, vol. 2, p. 490, says of these courts, "that
all powers of the vice-admiralty courts within His Majesty's
dominions are derived from the High Admiral, or the Commissioners of Admiralty in England, as inherent and incident to
that office. Accordingly, by virtue of their commission, the
Lords of the Admiralty are authorized to erect vice-admiralty
courts in North America, the West Indies, and the settlements
of the East India Company; and in case any person be aggrieved by sentence, or interlocutory decree having the force
of a sentence, he may appeal to the High Coult of Admiralty."
So, too, Blackstone, vol. 3,p. 68, says: "Appeals from the

vice-admiralty courts in America, and our other plantations and
settlements, may be brought before the courts of admiralty in
England, as being a branch of the Admiral's jurisdiction."
It may here be pertinently asked, how, with this exposition
of the law, can be reconciled the assertion that at the time of
the American Revolution, and down to the adoption of the
Constitution of the United States, there were vested in the
colonial courts of England, and were appropriate to them as
courts of admiralty, powers which never were vested in their
superior, by whom they were created, and by whom they were
to be supervised aud.ontrolled? With perfect respect, it would
seem to imply an incongruity, if not an absurdity, to ascribe to
any tribunal an appellate or revisory power with reference
to matters beyond its legitimate jurisdiction, and which confessedly belonged to a different authority. Yet is this assertion of jurisdiction in admiralty in the colonial courts beyond
that of their creator and superior, constantly renewed arguefido,
whilst, in reply to repeated challenges of authority by which
the assumption may be sustained, not one adjudication in point
has been adduced. Again, it may be asked whether, in the
history of jurisprudence, another instance can be found in
which it is alleged that a syster, a corpus juris, has grown up
and been established, and yet not an ingredient, not a fragment of any such system can be discovered? But there have
been decisions which were made in this country-decisions
cotemporaneous with the event of the separation from the
mother country; but these decisions, respectable for their learning and ability, so far from sustaining the obiter assertion above
mentioned, divest it of even plausibility; for they affirm and
maintain a complete conformity and subordination of the admiralty jurisdiction in the colonies, to that which had prevailed
in England from the time of the statutes of Richard, and from
the days of Owen, Brownlow, Hobart, Fortescue, and Coke.
I refer to the case of Clinton v. The Brig Hannah, decided by
Judge Hopkinson, of Pennsylvania, in 1781, and the case of
Shrewsbury v. The Sloop Two Friends, decided by Judge Bee,
of South Carolina, in 1786. And, indeed, the phrase "admiralty jurisdiction," except in the acceptation received by us
from the English courts, is without intelligible or definite
meaning, for under no other system of jurisprudence is the
law of the marine known to be admiinistered under the same
organization.
Let us now take a view of the claims advanced for the -admiralty power, in its constant attempts at encroachment upon

the principles and genius of the bommon law, and of our republican and peculiar institutions, at least from the decision in the.

ease of the Thomas Jefferson, in the 10th of Wheaton, p. 428,
to that of the Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, in the 12th of Howard, 443, inclusive; this last a case, to my apprehension, more
remarkable and more startling as an assumption of judicial
power than any which the judicial history of the country has
hitherto disclosed, prior to the case now under consideration.
By the statute of 13th Richard II, cap. 15th, it is enacted,
that "the Admirals and their deputies shall meddle with nothing done within the realm, but only with things done up6n the
sea;" and by the 15th of Richard II, cap. 3d, "that in all contracts, pleas, and quarrels, and other things done within the
bodies of counties, by land or water, the Admiral shall have no
cognizance, but they shall be tried by the law of the land."
The language of these provisions is truly remarkable. By that
of the first is denounced the exclusion, utterly, of the Admiral's
power from the entire realm; by that of the second, is as explicitly denied to him all cognizance of things done in the bodies
of the counties, eiher by land or by water. And the statute of
Henry IV, cap. 11, by way of insuring a sanction of these
exclusions, provides, "that he who finds himself aggrieved
against the form of the statutes of Richard, shall have his action grounded upon the case against him who so pursues in the
admiralty, and recover double damages." Lord Hale, in his
History ofthe Common Law, speaking of the court of admiralty,
says, (p. 51:) "This-court is not bottomed or founded upon
the authority of the civil law, but hath both its powers and
jurisdiction by the law and custom of the realm in such matters as are proper for its cognizance." And again, in an enumeration of matters not within the cognizance of the admiralty,
he continues: "So also of damages in navigable rivers within the
bodies of counties, things done upon the shore at low-water mark,
wreck of the sea, &c.; these things belong not to the Admiral's
jurisdiction." And the cause, the only cause assigned as the
foundation of that jurisdiction, is the peculiar locality of each
instance, viz: its being neither within the body of any county
or vicinage, nor infrafauces terrce, so that the venue or pays can
be summoned for its trial. No one pretends to doubt that thus
stood the admiralty law of the realm of England at the period
of separation from the American colonies, and perhaps in the
particulars above mentioned it may remain the unchanged law
of that country to the present moment, as it is a fact recorded
in history, that for a departure from that law, one of the most
learned and brilliant of her admiralty judges (Sir William
Scott, afterwards Lord Stowell) was condemned in a very
heavy verdict. Such, I say, was the law of the realm of England, and T think that the fallacy or pretence of any change in

DEOEMBER TERM, 1857.

318

.aekon et at. V. Steamboat Magnolia.

the admiralty law proper of that realm, in its application to the'
colonies, has been clearly demonstrated.
The admiralty law of England, according to every accurate
test, was the admiralty law of the United States at the period
of the adoption of the Constitution. It is pertinent in this
place to remark, that the jurisdiction of the admiralty having
been, both by the common law and by the language of the
statutes of Richard II and Henry IV, excluded not only from
the body of the counties, both on the land and on the water,
and even from the realm, it followed, ex consequenti, that the
locality of that jurisdiction was (and necessarily so) within the
ebb and flow of the tide. Hence, it is more than probable,
arose the adoption and use of the phrase as a portion of the
description of the 106us of that jurisdiction, viz: that it was
.maritime, i. e., connected with or Was upon the sea, and was
neither upon the land nor within the fauces terro,nor upon any
navigable water within a county, and was within the ebb and
flow of the tide.
Under such a state of the admiralty law, conceded to be the
law of England, and as I contend, the law of the United States,
came before this court for decision the case of the Thomas Jefferson, in the 10th of'Wheaton, p. 428. In this case, not a single
ingredient required by the English cases to give jurisdiction
existed. It could by no possibility or by any propriety of language be styled maritime, as every fact it presented occurred
at the distance of a thousand miles from the ocean, and it could
not be shown that there ever existed a tide in the water-course
on which the occurrences that produced the suit originated.
Yet, in the absence of these essential ingredients of admiralty
jurisdiction, the court, with that greed for power by which
courts are so often impelled beyond the line of strict propriety,
makes a query, whether, under the show of iegulating commerce,
Congress might not assert a distinctive and original authdrity,
viz: the, power of the admiralty. The court, however, felt
itself constrained to concede the necessity of a locality within
the ebb and flow of the tide, and for the want of that requisite
to deny the jurisdiction.
In the case of Peroux v. Howard, 7 Pet., 524, thd necessity
.for the ebb and flow of the tide to give. jurisdiction is equally
conceded; but the court, in order to maintain its power, deems
itself authorized to appeal virtute offci, not to the.attraction of
the moon, the received philosophic explanation of this phenomenon, but to the current of the Mississippi, whi.ch, iii precipitating' itself upon the waters of the Gulf,occasions, they
say, by conflict with the latter; some changes in the rise and

SUPREME COURT.
Jackson et al. v. Steamboat Magnolia.

tides possesses at least the characteristic of novelty. Whether
it will be accepted, and find a place in the annals of scientific
discovery, may admit of some doubt.
Next follows in order of time the case of the Steamboat
New Orleans v. Phcebus et al., 11 Pet., p. 175. In this case,
as in that of Peroux v. Howard, the vessel libelled was in the
same city of New Orleans, one of the termini of her trading
voyages, and adjudged by the case last mentioned to be within the
ebb and flow of the tide. It was contended by the counsel for
the claimants of the steamboat New Orleans, a gentleman now
upon this bench, that the situation of the steamboat libelled in
each case, as conferring jurisdiction by reason of locality, was
identical; and it surpasses any acumen I possess, to perceive
any real distinction between the cases. ' The court, however,
speaking through the late Justice Story, (whom none could
ever suspect of any leaning against the admiralty,) insisting
with consistent pertinacity on the requisite of the ebb and flow
of the tide, said: "The case is not one of a steamboat engaged
in maritime trade and navigation. Though in her voyages
she may have touched at one terminus of them in tide-waters,
her employment has been substantially on other waters. The
admiralty has not any jurisdiction over vessels employed on
such voyages in cases of disputes between part cwners. The
true test of its jurisdiction in all cases of this sort is, whether
the vessel be engaged substantially in maritime navigation, or
in interior navigation and.trade not on tide-waters. In the latter case, there is no jurisdiction. So that, in this view, the
District Court bad no jurisdiction over the steamboat involved
in the present controversy, as she was wholly engaged in voyages on such interiorwaters."
In the case of Waring et al. v. Clark, in the 5th of How.,
441, and in that of the New Jersey Steam Navigation Company v. The Merchants' Bank, in the 6th of How., 844, anoma
lous as these cases appear to me, and wholly unsustained
either, as I deem them, by English precedent or by that construction of the Federal Constitution which is warranted, nay
demanded, by the language of the Constitution, by history, or
precedent, yet they both concur in establishing the ebb and flow
of the tide as the test of jurisdiction in the admiralty. As, for
example, in the former of these last-mentioned cases, the court
announces the conclusion at which it had arrived, and which
it proposed to demonstrate by argument and authority, in the
following terms, viz: "It is the first time that the point has been
distinctly presented to this court, whether a case of collision
in our rivers, where the tide ebbs and flows, is within the admiralty jurisdiction of the courts of the United States if the locality

be, in the sense in which it is used by the common-lawjudges in
England, infra corpus comitatus. It is this- point that we are
now about to decide, and it is our wis);i that nothing which
may be said in the course of our remarks shall be extended to
embrace any other case of contested admiralty jurisdiction."
Thus, too, in the second of these cases, 1dlson, T., as the organ of the majority of the court, p. 392, propounds these propositions: "On looking into the several cases in admiralty
which have come before this court, and in which its jurisdiction was involved or came under observation, it will be found
that the inquiry has been, not into the jurisdiction of the
court of admiralty in. England, but into the nature and
subject-matter of the contract, whether it was a maritime
contract, and the service a maritime service, to be performed upon the sea, or upon waters within the ebb and flow of
the tide." And again: "The exclusive jurisdiction-in admiralty was conferred on the National Government, as closely connected with the grant of the commercial power. It is a
maritime court, instituted for the purpose of administering the'
law of the seas. There. seems to be ground, therefore, for restraining its jurisdiction in some measure within the grant of
the commercial power, which would confine it in cases of contracts to those concerning the navigation and trade of the
country, upon the high seas and tide-waters, with foreign countries,.
and anongst the several States.. Contracts growing out of the
purely internal commercre of the Statei as well as commerce beyond tide-waters, are generally domestic in their origin and operation, and could scarcely have been intended to be drawn
within the cognizance of the Federal courts."
These several decisions, founded, as they are believed to
have been, in error, and upon a misconstruction of the law, of
the Constitution, and the history of the country, in so far as
they sought to 'permit invasions of the territorial, municipal,
and political rights of the States, are, nevertheless, not entirely without their value. By the limit they prescribed to ihe
admiralty, viz: the ebb and flow of the tide, they at least rejected the ambitious claim to undefined and undefinable judi-cial discretion over the Constitution and the law, (and the
indispensable territorial rights of the States,) and so far fortified
the foundations of a Government, based, in theory at any rate,
upon restricted and exactly-defined delegations of power only.
It was under the stress of the aforegoing decisions, and, as is
well known, upon an application of a portion of this court,
that the act of Congress of February 26, 1845,. cap. 22, was
passed, with the sole view of extending the admiralty jurisdiction to cases arising uoon the lakes, and upon the rivers con-

-

Jakon et al. v. Steamboat Magnolia.

necting the said lakes, on which there were no tides, and which
(i. e., the lakes) were within no State limits. Here, then, we
have the exception, the solitary exception, fortifying the general rule as to the admiralty jurisdiction, which jurisdiction is
again described and defined in this provision of the statute
above quoted, as existing upon the high seas or upon the tidewaters of the United States only.
This interference by the legislative department of the Gov,
ernment, elicited, too, by the judiciary department, whether
within the competency of the former, under the Constitution,
or not, must be received by every reasonable rule of induction
as a concession, by both, that there existed a propriety or necessity for the enlargement of the admiralty jurisdiction over the
lakes, and the rivers which connected them, in which there
were no tides, and that whatever extension was either called
for or made must be the result of legislative action, and not of
mere judicial discretion. The repeated and explicit decisions
of this court already cited, and the act of Congress of 1845,
might, it is supposed, have been regarded as some earnest of
uniformity and certainty in defining the admiralty jurisprudence of the United States, at least upon the points adjudged,
and as to the provisions of the statute; but, in this age of progress, such anticipations are held. to be amongst the wildest fallacies. It is now discovered that the principles asserted by the
admiralty courts in England, or said to have been propounded
by the mysterious, unedited, and unproduced proceedinogs of
the colonial vice-admiralty courts, so often avouched here in
argument; the decisions of this court and the provisions of the
act of 1845, are all to be thrown aside, as wholly erroneous.
That the admiralty power is not to be restricted by its effect
upon the territorial, political, or municipal rights and institutions upon which it may be brought to bear, nor by any checks
from the authority of the common law. That there is but one
rule by which its extent is to be computed, and that is the rule
which measures it by miles or leagues; that the scale for its
admeasurement can be applied only cs the discretion of the
judiciary may determine, upon its necessity or policy, irrespective of the Constitution, the statute, or the character of the
element on which it is to be exerted, or the adjudications of
this court on this last point. That the admiralty of the fixed
and limited realm of England, and as known to the framers of
the Constitution, cannot be the admiralty of this day; and, of
course, theadmiralty of our time and of our present day must
be changed according to the judgment or discretion of the
courts, in the event of further acquisitions of territory.
Such' are the conclusions regularly deducible from the opin-

ion of this court in the case of the Genesee Chief-conclusions,
in my deliberate judgment, the most startling and dangerous
innovations, anterior to that decision, ever attempted upon the
powers and rights of*internal government appertaining'to the
tates. Speaking of the case of Waring v. Clark, the court
say, p. 456 of 12 Bow.: "The majority of the'court thought there
was sufficient proof of tide there, and consequently it was not
necessary to consider whether the admiralty power extended
higher. But that case showed the unreasonableness of giving
a construction to the Constitution which would measure the
jurisdiction of the admiralty by the tide." It may, I think, be
here pertinently inquired, whether the natural and appropriate
limit of a jurisdiction, admitted by all to be maritime, can be
the more reasonably measured by the element on which alone
that jurisdiction is authorized to act, for which alone existence
has'been given it, or by an indefinite, arbitrary, and mutable
mathematical or geographical extension? Again, it is said by
the court, (p. 457,) speaking of the limitation resulting from
the character of the riv-er: "If such be the construction, theii
a line drawn across the river Mississippi would limit the jurisdiction, although there were ports of entry above it, and water
as deep and navigable, and the commerce as rich and exposed
to the same hazards and incidents as the commerce below."
If the experience of a pretty long, official life had not familiarized me with instances, unhappily not a few, in which the
meaning and objects of the Constitution and the just influence
of the actually surrounding condition of the country when that
instrument was framed have been lost sight of or made to yield
to some prevailing vogue of the times, I confess that some surprise would have been felt at the seeming forgetfulness of the ,
court in giving utterance to the expressions above quoted, of
the facts, that when the Constitution was adopted, there was
no such navigation as that on the Mississippi then known-no
such river was then possessed by the United States; that the
Constitution was formed by, and for, a coexisting political and
civil association; was designed to be adapted to that state of
things; and was in itself complete, and fully adapted to the
ends and subjects to which it was intended to be applied. And
but for the reason or the examples above referred to, the greater
surprise would have been awakened by the disregard manifested, in the reasoning of the court, to this great findamental
principle of.republican government, that if the Constitution
was, at the period of its adoption, or has since, by the muta..
tions of time and events, become inadequate to accomplish the
objects, of its creation, it belongs exelusively to those Wbo
formed it, and in whom resides the right to alter or abolish--,

318

to remedy its defects. No such power can exist with those
who are the. creatures of the Constitution, clothed with the
humbler office of executing the provisions of that instrument.
Suppose, at the time of its adoption, the Constitution was universally believed to be defective, in many respects essentially
defective, would such a conviction have rendered it less the
Constitution? Would it have lessened in any degree the obligation of obedience to it, or changed the power whence a remedy for its defects was to be derived? Could the judicialT,
without usurpation, have essayed such a remedy? It is conceded by the court, that at the time of forming the Constitution the admiralty jurisprudence of England was the only system known and practiced in this country; it is admitted, also,
that the English system was limited in theory and practice to
the ebb and flow of the tide. It is further admitted, that at
the time the Constitution was adopted, and our courts of ,dmiralty went into operation, the definition which had been
adopted in England was equally proper here. These admissions
form a virtual surrender of anything like a foundation on which
the decision of the court could be rested, either in the case of
the Genesee Chief or in this case depending on that alone.
For, if it be admitted that at the time of the adoption of the
Constitution the admiralty rule in England limited the jurisdiction to tide-waters, and that the same rule was adopted and
was proper here, it follows, by inevitable induction, that the
jurisdiction intended to be created by the Constitution was
that which was the only one then known, and which, in the
language of this court, was then proper here, (as the Constitution cannot be supposed to establish anything unauthorized or
improper,) and necessarily was complete, and adapted to the
existing state of things. And this inquiry, therefore, forces
itself upon us, viz: if the system was thus limted, and was
known to be so by the framers of the Constitution, and if this
instrument was designed to be applicable to the existing state
of things, and was complete in itself, in all its delegations of
and restrictions upon power, where is to be sought the right or
power to enlarge or to diminish the effect or meaning of the
instrument to make it commensurate with a predicament or
state of things not merely not existing when the Constitution
was framed, %ut which was not even within the contemplation
of those by whom it was created? Such a power could not
exist in the legislature, the only branch of the Government on
which anything like a faculty to originate measures was conferred; much less could it be claimed by functionaries who have
not, and rightfully cannot have, any creative faculties, but whose
capacities and duties are restricted to an interpretation of the

.Tadcon et al. v. Steamboat Magnolia.

Constitution and laws as they should have been fairly expounded at the times of their enactment.
But the court, after having declared the correctness of the
English rule and its adoption here, go on to say, nevertheless,
"that a definition which would at this day limit public rivers
to lide-wdter rivers is wholly inadmissible." And -why? Because the Constitution, either by express language or by necessary implication, recognises or looks to any change or enlargement in the principles or the extent of admiralty jurisdiction?
Oh, no! For no such reason as this. ."But we have now (say
the court) thousands of miles of public navigable water, incluing lakes and rivers, in which there is no tide." Such is
the argument of the court, and, correctly interpreted, it amounts
to this: The Constitution, which at its adoption suited perfectly
well the situation of the couintry, and which .hen was
unquestionably of supreme authority, we now adjudge to have
•become unequal to the exigencies of the times; it must therefore be substituted by something more efficient; and as the
people, and the States, and the Federal Legislature, are tardy
or delinquent in making this substitution, the duty or the
credit of this beneficent work must be devolved upon the judiciary. Itis saidbythe court, "that there is certainly no reason
for admiralty power over a public tide-water, which does not
apply with equal force to any other public waters used for commercial purposes." Let this proposition be admitted literally,.it
would fall infinitely short of a dem6nstration, that because the
Constitution, adequate to every exigency when created, did
not comprise predicaments not then in existence or in contemplation, it can be stretched, by any application of judicial
torture, to cover any such exigency, either real or supposed.
* This argument forcibly revives the recollection of the interpretation of the phrase "necessary and proper," once ingeniously
and strenuously wielded to prove that a bank, incorporated
with every faculty and attribute of such an institution, was not
in reality, nor was designed to be, a bank; but was essentially
an agent, an indispensable agent, in the administration of the
Federal Government. And with reference to this doctrine of
necessity, or propriety, or convenience, it may here be remarked, that it is as gratuitous and as much out of place with
respect to the admiralty jurisdiction, as it was with respect to
the Bank of the United States-perhaps still more so; as it is
certain, and obvious to every well-infbrmed individual, that,
with the exception of some -of the lakes, there is not a watercourse in the country, situated above the ebb and flow of the
tide, which is not bounded on one or on both its margins by
some county. And in the dase before us, it is alleged expressly

Jackson et al. v. Steamboat Maynolia.

in the pleading, and admitted throughout, that every fact in
reference thereto transpired upon an inland water of the State
of Alabama, two hundred miles above the tide, and within the
county of Wilcox, in that State. And by adhering to what is
an essential test of the admiralty jurisdiction in England, and
formerly adopted and practiced upon in this country, there
will be obtained a standard as to that jurisdiction, far more
uniform and rational than that furnished by the tides. I allude
to the rule which repels the pretensions of the admiralty whenever it attempts to intrude them infra corpus comitatus. This
is the true rule as to jurisdiction, as it is susceptible of certainty,
and concedes and secures to each system of jurisprudence, that
of the admiralty and of the common law, its legitimate and
appropriate powers. For this plaiii and rational test, this court
now attempts to substitute one in its nature vague and arbitrary, and tending inevitably to confusion and conflict. It is
now affirmed, that the jurisdiction and powers of the admiralty
extend to all waters that are navigable within or without the
territory of a State. In quest of certainty, under this new
doctrine, the inquiry is naturally suggested, what are navigable waters? Will it be proper to adopt, in the interpretation
of this phrase, an etymological derivation from navis, and to
designate, as navigable waters, those only on whose bosomsships and navies can be floated? Shall it embracwaters on
which sloops and shallops, or what are genera,1y termed river
craft, can swim; or shall it be extended to any water on which
a batteau or a pirogue can be floated? These are all, at any
rate, practicablewaters, navigable in a certain sense. If any
point between the extremes just mentioned is to be taken,
there is at once opened a prolific source of uncertainty, of 'nontestation and expense. And if the last of these extremes be
adopted, then there is scarcely an internal *ater-course, whether
in its natural condition, or as improved under the authority
and with the resources of the States, or a canal, or a mill-pond,
s6me of which are known to cover many acres of land, (and,
as this court can convert rivers without tides into seas, may be
metamorphosed into small lakes,) which would not by this
doctrine be brought within the grasp of the admiralty. Some
of our canals are navigated by steam, and some of them by
sails; some of them are adjuncts to rivers, and form continuous
communications with the ocean; all of them are fed by, and
therefore are made portions of, rivers. Under this new regime,
the hand of Federal power may be thrust into everything, even
into a vegetable or fruit basket; and there is no production of
a farm, an orchard, or a garden, on the margin of these watercourses, which is not liable to be arrested on its way to the next

of appendages; and the simple, plain, homely countTyman,
who imagined he had some comprehension of his rights, and
their remedies under the cognizance of a justice of the peace,
or of a county court, is now, through the instrumentality of
some apt fomenter of trouble, metamorphbsed and magnified
from a country attorney into a proctor, to be confounded and
put to silence by a learned display from Roccus de Navibus,
Emerigon, or Pardessus, from the Mare Clausum, or from the
Trinity Masters, or the Apostles.
A citizen of any State of this Confederacy, bound as he is
by habit, by affection, and fealty, to the soil and the institutions
of his fathers, upon whom this magnificent machinery is
brought to bear, (especially when recollecting by whom, and
for whose sole benefit, this Confederacy was created,) may, as
I have often done when contemplating the ceaseless march of
central encroachment, be led to a tone of reflection like the
following:
"Urbem quam Romam dicunt putavi,
Stultus ego, huic nostrae similem,
Verum hmc tantum, alias inter caput extulit urbes,
Quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi."

Few, comparatively, of the attributes of sovereignty and
equality, presupposed to have existed in those by whom the
Federal Government was created, have remained perfectly intact and exempt from aggression by their own creature; and
by no conceivable agency could they be more fearfully assailed
than by this indefiite and indefinable pretension to admiralty
power, which, spurning the restraints prescribed to it by the
wise caution of our own ancestors, challenges, as occasion suits,
the opinions and practices of all nations, people, and tongues,
however diverse or incongruous with the genius of our own
institutions.
Not the least curious circumstance marking this course, is
the assertion, that it produces equality amongst all the citizens
of the United States. Equality it may be, but it is equality
of subjection to an unknown and unlimited discretion, in lieu
of allegiance to defined and legitimate authority.
In truth, the extravagance of these claims to an all-controlling central power, their utter incongruity with any just proportion or equipoise of the.different parts of our system, would
exhibit them as positively ludicrous, were it not'for the serious
mischiefs to which, if tolerated, they must inevitably leadmischiefs which should characterize those pretensions as fatal
to the inherent and necessary powers of self-preservation and
internal government in the States; as at war with the interVOL. XX.

be reprobated and wholly rejected. For myself, I can only
say, that to whatsoever point they may, under approbation
here or elsewhere, have culminated, they never can offer themselves for my acceptation. but they must encounter my solemn
rebuke. "
Mr. Justice CAMPBELL dissenting:
I dissent from the judgment of the court in this cause, and
from the opinion delivered by the judges composing a majority
of the court.
The judgment ot the District Court affirms that the court
had no jurisdiction as a court of admiralty, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, in a cause of collision
arising in Wilcox county, in the Stafe of Alabama, between
steamboats navigating the Alabama river. The Alabama river
flows entirely within the State, and discharges itself into the
Mobile river, and through that and the Mobile bay connects
with the Gulf of Mexico. The collision occurred two hundred
miles above the ebb and flow of the tide, and on a river
upon which no port of entry or delivery before that time had
been established. This court decides that the judgment shall
be reversed, and that the District Court shall take cognizance
of the cause, against its own sense of obligation and duty.
It is my opinion that this court claims a power for the DisLrict Court not delegated to the Federal Government in the
Constitution of the mJnited States, and that Congress, in organizing the judiciary department, lve not conferred upon
any court of the United States. That this court has assumed
jJurisdiction over a case only cognizable at the common law,
and triable by a jury; and that its opinion and judgment contravene the authority and doctrine of a large number of decisions pronounced by this court, and by the Circuit Courts, after
elaborate arguments and mature deliberation, and which for
a long period have formed a rule of decision to the court, and
of opnion to the legal profession; and that no other judgment
of this court affords a sanction to this. (10 Wheat., 428; 7
Pet., 824; 11 Pet., 175; 12 Pet., 72; 5 How., 441; 6 How., 344;
4 Dall., 426; 2 Gall., 398; The Anne, 1 Mas., 109; 1 Bald., 544.)
The judicial power of the United States extends to all cases
in law and equity arising under the Constitution and laws of
the United States, and treaties made, or-which, shall be made,
under their authority-to all cases of admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction. Whatever other jurisdiction is allowed to the
judiciary department is particular in its nature, depending
upon the character or status of the persons or communities

who are parties to the controversy, and not upon the subjectmatter. This classification of the cases to which the judicial
power of the United States should extend among courts of
law, equity, and of admira lty and maritime jurisdiction, refers
to a division recognised in the .jurisprudence of all the States
that were parties to the Federal compact, and is intimately related to the constitutional history of the colonies and of the
mother'countfy. Neither at the Declaration of Independence
by the Colonies, nor when the Federal Constitution was
adopted, was there a body of municipal law common to the
States, nor a uniform system of judicial procedure in use in
their courts. Until the Constitution was framed, the States
preserved thEir sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and
every power, jurisdiction, and right, which had not been expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.
Whatever reference is made in the Federal Constitution to
any existing system of law, or any modes of judicial proceeding, as the basis of a distribution of power and authority, relates to the system thus rccognised as existing in the several
States as it was received from England.
A portion of that judicial system was esteemed of such vital
importance to the liberty of the citizen, that it was incorporated into the Constitution of the United States, and placed
above the reach of the authority of any department of the
Federal Government. The sections of the Constituti6n, "that
no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise
infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of the
grand jury; that, in all criminal prosecutions,. the accused shall
enjoy the right of trial by an impartial jury of the State and
district wherein the crime shall have been committed," and
"be informed of the nature and cause of his accusation;"
"that in suits at common law, when the value in controversy
shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be
preserved;" "that no person shalffbe deprived of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law;" and others of a like
kind, identify the meni of the Revolution as the descendants
of ancestors who had maintained for many centuries a persevering and magnanimous strurcgle for a constitutional Government, in which the people sould directly participate, and
which would secure to their posterity the blessing of liberty.
The supremacy of those courts of justice that aeknowledged
the right of the people- to share in their administration, and
dirccted their administration according to the course of the
common law, in all the material subjects of litigation-of that
common law which .sprung from the people themselves, and is
legitimate by that highest of all sanctions, the consent of those

who are submitted to it-of that common law, which resulted
from the habitual thoughts, usages, conduct, and legislation,
of a practical, brave, an5i self-relying race-was established in
England and in the United States ony by their persevering and
heroic exertions and sacrifices. Magna Charta, from which a
portion of this Constitution was extracted, was, according to
Lord Brougham, "a declaration of existing and violated
rights."' It was renewed thirty times. To preserve its authority, it was read in churches, published four times a year in the
county courts, sustained by force of arms, and when violated,
the commons vindicated it by the infliction of exemplary punishment upon the guilty authors. A delinquent King at one
time was required to imprecate the wrath of Heaven on those
who transgressed it. The archbishop and bishops, apparelled
in their official robes, with candles burning, "did excommunicate, accurse, and from the threshold of the church cut off
all those who, by any art or device, shall violate, break, lessen,
or change, secretly or openly, by deed, word, or counsel, against
it, in any article whatsoever, and all those that against it shall
make statutes, or observe them being made, or shall bring in
customs, or keep them when they be brought in, and the
writers of such statutes, and also the counsellors and executioners of them, and all those that shall presume to judge according to them."
The old historian, who describes this solemn ceremony, says,
"that when this imprecation was uttered, and when the candles
extinguished had been hurled upon the ground, and the fumes
and stench rose offensive to the nostrils and eyes of those who
observed it, the archbishop cried, "Even so let the damned
souls be extinguished, smoke, and stink, of all who violate this
charter or unrighteously interpret it."
The reign of Richard H was an epoch to be remembered
with interest, and studied with care, by those concerned in
administering the constitutional law of England or the United
States. A formal complaint was made by the Commons of
defects in the administration, as well about the King's person
and his household as in his courts of justice, and redress was
demanded. Measures were taken for placing the judicial institutions of England upon a solid constitutional foundation,
and to exclude from the realm the odious systems of the continent. The first of the enactments was directed against the
usurpations of the great military officers, who administered
justice by virtue of their seignoral powers--the Lords' Constable and the Earl Marshal. The acts of 8th and 18th Richard II
provide that, "because the Commons do make a grievous complaint that the court of the Constable and Marshal have ac

croached to them, and do daily aceroach, contracts, covenants,
trespasses, debts, detinues, and many other actions pleadable
at the common law, in great prejudice to the King, .and to the
great grievance and oppression of the people," therefore they
were prohibited, and their jurisdiction confined "to contracts
and deeds of arms without the realm," and things that touch
more within the realm which cannot bQ determined and discussed by the common law."
The Lord High Admiral received a similar rebuke. The
preamble of the act of 18 Richard II recites, "that complaints
had arisen becauseAdmirals and their deputies hold their sessions within divers places of the realm, accroaching to them
greater authority than belonged to their office, to the prejudice
of the King, &c." It was declared that the Admiral should not
meddle with anything done-within the realm, but only with
things done upon the sea, as had been used in the time of Edward HI. But this did not suffice to restrain the accroaching.
spirit of that feudal lord and his deputies.'
Two years after, the Parliament enacted, "that the court of
admiralty bath no manner of cognizance, power, nor jurisdictlion of any manner of contract, plea, or quarrel, or of any other
thing done or rising within the bodies of counties, either by
land or water, and also with wreck of the sea; but all such.
manner-of contracts, pleas, and quarrels, and all other things
rising within the bodies of counties, as well by land as iby water
as aforesaid, and alsowreck of the sea, shall be tried, termined,
discussed, and remedied by the laws of the land, and not before,
nor by the Admiral or his lieutenant, in no manner. Nevertheless, of the death of a man and of a mayhem ddn in great
ships, being and hovering in the main stream of the geat rivers, beneath the points of the same rivers, and in no. otherplace
of the same rivers, the Admiral shall have cognizance."
In the sixteenth year of the reign of Richard II, the rule of
the Roman chancery, like thatof the Lords' Constable, Marshal,
and Admiral, was banished from England. In that year it was
enacted that, "Both those-who shall pursue or cause to be
pursued, in the court of Rome or elsewhere, any processes, or
instruments, or other things whatsoever, which touch the King,
against his crown and regality, or his realm, shall be outlawed
and placed out of the Tinig's protection." In the following
reign the accroaching spirit of the courts of admiralty received
a further rebuke.
Upon the prayer of the Commons, the statutes of Richard
11 were confirmed, and a penalty was inflicted upon such as
should maintain suits in the admiralty, contrary to their spirit.
This body of statute law served in a great degree to check

826

the usurping tendencies of these anomalous jurisdictions, and
to prevent in a measure the removal of suits triable at the common law ad aliud examen, and to be discussed per aliam legem.
It placed upon an eminence the common law of the realm, and
enabled the Commons to plead with authority against other
encroachments and usurpations upon the general liberty. But,
though a foreign law and despotism were not allowed to enter
the kingdom through the courts martial, ecclesiastical, or admiral, the perversion of judiciary powers to purposes of oppression was not effectually prevented. The courts of the Star
Chamber and of High Commission, originally limited to specific objects, "assumed power to intermeddle in civil causes
and matters only of private interest between party and party,
and adventured to determine the estates and liberties of the
subject, contrary to the law of the land and the rights and privileges of the subject," and "had been by experience found to
be an intolerable burden, and the means to introduce an arbitrary power and government." Among the cases of jurisdiction claimed by the Star Chamber were those between merchant strangers and Englishmen, or between strangers, and for
the restitution of ships and goods unlawfully taken, or other
deceits practiced on merchants.
One of the most practiced proctors of this court has left his
testimony: "That since the great Roman Senate, so famous
in all ages and nations as that they might be called jure mirum
orbis, there hath no court come so near them, in state, honor,
and adjudication, as this." But, by the 16th of Charles I, it
was enacted, both in respect of this and the High Commission
Court, "that from henceforth no court, council, or place of
judicature, shall be erected, ordained, constituted, or appointed,
which shall have, use, or exercise the same or like jurisdiction
as is or hath been used, practiced, or exercised," in those courts.
But the statute did not terminate with this. The patriot
leaders of that time, reviewing in the preamble to the act the
various parliamentary enactments in regard to the legal institutions of England, and reciting those declarations of the public liberties which had extended over a period of four hundred
years, proceeded to add another. It was solemnly enacted, "that
neither his Majesty, nor his Privy Council, have, or ought to
have, any jurisdiction, power, or authority, by English bill, petition, articles, libel, or any other arbitrary whatsoever, to examine or draw in question, determine, or dispose of the lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods, and chattels, of any of the subjects
of this realm, but that the same ought to be tried and determined
in the ordinary courts of justice, and by the ordinary course
of the law."

.Tackson et alv. Steamboat Atagnolia.

This selection of a few sections from various English statutes,
and the historical facts I have mentioned, is designed to illustrate the intensity and duration of the contest which resulted
in placing the judiciary institutions of England on their existing founaation. In the midst of that contest, the settlements
were formed in America in which those institutions were successfully planted.
They have been incorporated into the Constitution of the
United States, and prevail from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. These statutes
show how the courts martial, ecclesiastical, admiral, and courts
proceeding from an arbitrary royal authority, were either limited or suppressed.
The inquiry arises, how would a case like that before this
court have been decided .in England, either at the period of
the Declaration of Independence, or at the adoption of the
Constitution of the United States, in the court of admiralty?
In 1832 a question arose in that court, whether a cause of
collision, arising between steam vessels navigating the river
Humber, a short distance from the sea, within the ebb and flow
of the tide, within the port of Hull, below the first bridges,
when the tide was three-fourths flood, was cognizable by the
court. The judge of the admiralty, an exact and conscientious
judge, answered: "Since the statutes of Richard II and of
Heiry IV, it has been strictly held that the court of admiralty
cannot exercise jurisdiction in civil causes arising if9ra corpus
conilatas." I cite this opinion not simply as evidence of the
law in 1832, but also as affording authentic evidence of the
historical fact it enunciates. (The Public Opinion, 2 Hagg.,
399.)
I proceed now to inquire of the admiralty jurisdiction as
exercised by the courts of vice-admiralty in the colonies and
in the United States before the adoption of the Constitution.
The jurisdiction included four subjects, and a separate examination of each title of jurisdiction will shed light upon the
discussion. These are-prize; breaches of the acts of navigation, revenue, and trade; crimes and misdemeanors on the
high seas; and cases of civil and maritime jurisdiction.
'he prize jurisdiction originated in a special commission
from the King, and is usually conferred at the commencement
of hostilities, upon the Admiral and his subordinates. It is a
part of the ancient jrisdiction of the court, as thus derived.
Congress, by the Artiles of Confederation, were authorized to
appoint courts of appeal to determine finally upon cases of that
kind, and no doubt has ever been expressed that this branch
of jurisdiction, under the Constitution and acts 6f Coligress

828

since the adoption of the Constitution, is vested in the District
Courts of the United States. (The Hunter, 1 Dod., 483; Le
Coux v. Eden, 2 Doug., 613; 13 How., 498; 2 Gall., 325;
ib., 20.)
The admiralty court of Great Britain and the vice-admiralty
courts of the colonies were vested with jurisdiction over cases
for the violation of a series of statutes for the regulation of
trade and revenue in the colonies. The origin and extent of
this jurisdiction are explained in the case of the Columbus, decided in the British admiralty in 1789, on an appeal from the
vice-admiralty court of Barbados. The learned judge of that
court said: "The court of admiralty derives no jurisdiction in
causes of revenue from the patent of the judge, or from the
ancient customary and inherent jurisdiction of the prerogative
of the Crown, in the person of its Lord High Admiral, and exercised by his lieutenant, Not a word is mentioned of the
King's revenue, which seems to have been entirely appropriated to the Cour t of Exchequer, which is both a court of law
and equity. If, therefore, there is any inherent prerogative
right of judging of seizures upon the sea, for the rights and
dues of the Crown, whether of peace or of war, as in the right
of prize and reprisal, that prerogative jurisdiction is put in
motion by special commission or by act of Parliament. The
first statute which places judgment of revenue in the plantations with the courts of admiralty, is the 12th of Charles II,
ch. 18, sec. 1, which act has been followed by subsequent statute's." This lucid opinion has not been cited in any previous
discussion of the subject in this court, from the fact that it is
not published in the regular series of the admiralty reports.
(2 Coll. Jur.,'82; 2 Dod. Adm. R., 352.)
By an act of the 22d and 28d Charles II, to regulate the trade
of the plantations, suits were authorized for breaches of its enactments "in the court of the High Admiral of England, or of
any of his vice-admirals," or in any court of record. The acts
of 7th and 8th of William II,6th George I, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th,
and 8th, of George Iff, confer plenary jurisdiction upon the
same courts, in cases of navigation, trade, and revenue, in the
colonies, and the later statutes extend their authority to seizures upon the land as well as water. The reason for this jurisdiction, as given in the acts themselves, and as repeated by
British writers, is not creditable to the colonists; but, as Justice Chase has assigned in this court a similar reason for the
acts of Congress on the same subject, no offence can be taken
for repeating the British opinion. Reeves, in his History of
Navigation and Shipping, says: " The laws of navigation were
nowhere disobeyed and contemned so openly as in New Eng-

land;" "that in minds tempered as theirs were, obedience
and disobedience 'were much the same thing to the interests
of the mother country;" "that the contraband trade was carried on with skill and courage;." "that the exclusion of all
but native subjects of Great Britain from serving on juries
afforded no corrective;" "that for the purpose of securing the
execution of the acts of trade and navigation, the Government
proceeded to institute courts of admiralty, and to appoint persons to the office of attornby general in those plantations where
such courts and such offices had never before been known;
and from this time there seems to have been a more general
obedience to the acts of trade and navigation." (Reeves's Hist.,
79, 90; Stokes's Const. Col., 360, 361.)
The first of these acts was passed when the colonial settlements in New England and Virginia were in their infancy,
and before those in the remaining colonies had been fairly commenced. The jurisdiction was familiar to the colonists, aiid
these acts explain the origin of the clause of the judiciary act
of 1789 on th6 same subject. The judiciary act confer's on the
District Courts "cognizance of all civil causes of civil and
maritime jurisdiction, including all seizures under laws of impost, navigation, or trade, of the United States, when the seizures are made on waters which are navigable from the sea by
vessels of ten or more tons burden, within their respective districts, as well as upon the high seas." It is difficult td 6omprehend on what principle the court can construe the grant of
jurisdiction in this act over cases of seizure under the law of
impost and trade upon navigable waters, to an extension of the
civil jurisdiction of the admiralty to the same localities. The
admiralty jurisdiction, in cases of seizure, is a special jurisdiction, not belonging to the original constitution of the courts of
admiralty, and this act treats it as such. And so this court,
until the revolution in its doctrines in these latter years, uniformly treated it. The long and painful discussions from
Delovio v. Boit to the INew Jersey Navigation Case, are without meaning on any other hypothesis. If the jurisdiction in
both classes of cases had. been supposed to xest on the same
foundation, the whole controversy would have been settled by
the case of "La Vengeance," reported in 3 Dall., 297.
The civil and maritime jurisdiction of the vice-admiralty
courts extended to thQ same subjects and was exercised under
the same limitations in the colonies as in Great Britain. "Upon
the establishment of colonial Governments," says a learned
judge of one of those courts, "it was deemed proper to invest
the Governors with the same civil and maritime jurisdiction;
and therefore it became usual for the Lord High Admiral or the

330

SUPREME COURT.
.ack8on et al. v. Steamboat Magnolia.

Lords Commissioners to grant a commission of vice-admiral to
them." The office thus conferred on the Governor was precisely the same with that of the vice-admirals in England, and
was confined to that civil and maritime jurisdiction which was
the original branch of his authority. (Stewart's V. Ad. R.,
394, 405.) These courts were subordinate to the admiralty
court of Enoland, and, until the late reign of William

Fl,

it

received appeals from them. (1 Dod. Adm. R., 381.) The
incompatibility of the criminal jurisdiction of the Admiral on
the high seas with the legal constitution of England, was declared and corrected by the 28 I. VIII, ch. 15.
Hawkins, in his Pleas, says that, it being inconsistent with
the liberties of the nation that any man's life should be taken
away, unless by the judgment of his peers or the common law
of this land, that act was passed. (1 Hawk. PI., 251.) And
the same principle is embodied in the Constitution of the
United States, with much enlargement; for the extension of
the admiralty jurisdiction under the laws, professedly of navigation and trade, for the punishment of offences and misdemeanors, in the reign of George IT, was a prominent cause of
the American Revolution. In 1768, John Adams, the Coke
of the Revolution, prepared for the citizens of Boston instructions to their representatives, Otis, Cushing, Samuel Adams,
and Hancock. The citizens said to their representatives, that,
"next to the revenue itself, the late extensions of the jurisdiction of the admiralty are our greatest grievance. The American courts of admiralty seem to be forming by degrees into a
system that is to overturn our constitution, and to deprive us
of our best inheritance, the laws of the land. It would be
thought in England a dangerous innovation, if the trial of any
matter on land was given to the admiralty." They refer to
the statutes passed in the reign of George ll, and declare
that they violate Magna Charta; and they conclude by an
earnest recommendation to their representatives, "by every legal
measure to endeavor that the power of these courts may be confined to
their proper element, according the ancient .English statutes; and
that they petition and remonstrate against the late extensions
of their jurisdictions, and they doubt not that the other colonies and- provinces, who suffer with them, will cheerfully harmonize with them in anyj ustifiable measures of redress." Other
testimony of the same kind might be adduced, to show what
the opinions of the colonists were, as to the legitimate extent
of the admiralty jurisdiction in the colonies. The journals of
the First Congress (1774) render this unnecessary. They are
replete with proof of the pervading sentiment in the British
colonies.

That Congress declare that "the respective colonies are
entitled to the common law of England, and to the benefit of
such English statutes as existed at the time of the colonization,
which had been found suitable to their situation." In their
address setting forth the cause and necessity for their taking
up of arms, they allege that statutes have been passed for extending the jurisdiction of courts of admiralty beyond their
ancient limits. In the several addresses to the inhabitants of
Great Britain, to the people of the colonies, to the people of
Ireland,, and to the King, the enlarged authority of those
courts, their interference with the common-law right of trial
by jury, and their offensive use .of the laws and course of prcceeding adopted from Roman tyrants, are distinctly reprehended. (1 Jour. Congr., 16, 28, 32, 47, 101.)
There can be no room for doubt that the statesmen and
Jurists who composed.the Congress of 1774 regarded the limits
of the courts of admiralty as settled by the statutes of Richard
II, Henry IV, Henry VIII, and the early aots of navigation
and trade, and that the enlargement of this jurisdiction was
such awrong as to justify a resort to arms. Their declarations
bear no other interpretation; and the admiralty system of the
States before the Constitution was administered upon this
opinion. (Bee's Adm. R., 419, 433; 1 Dall., 33.)
Before examining the constitutional history and Constitution
of the United States, it will not be irrelevant to ascertain the
origin of the courts of admiralty in France, and their jurisdiction at the period of the adoption of the Constitution. The
Admiral was, in France, as in England, a great feudatory, with
the seignoral privilege of administering justice by judges of his
appointment. There were there, as in England, contests with
other officers in regard to jurisdiction, and the royal authority
was interposed to settle them. In 1627, the office, with its dig.nity an(! privileges, was'abolished; in 1668, it was revived by
Louis XIV, and conferred upon a member of the royal family;
in 1791, it was suppressed, and its judicial establishment disappeared from history, other courts and authorities being established to perform their functions. The ordinances of Louis
XIV enlarged and defined the jurisdiction of the courts of the
Admiral, to promote the convenience of commerce, to determine
the unsettled jurisprudence concerning maritime contracts, to
define the duties of seamen, the'powers of the officers, and to
provide an adequate police for the ports, harbors, and the coasts
of the sea.
Their jurisdiction extended to a number of cases of contract
specified in the ordinance, and conferred the ancient jurisdiction over piracies and thefts at sea, the desertion of crews, and

generally of all crimes, offences, and trespasses, committed on
the sea, in ports, roadsteads, and havens, and the shores within
the ebb and flow of the tide.
The police and navigation of the rivers of France were not
placed under the admiralty, but were regulated by other officers under other ordinances. Without supposing that the ordinances of Louis XTV have any authority on this subject, it is
yet certain that a cause of collision arising upon one of the rivers of France above the ebb and flow of the tide was. not cognizable before the admiralty of France, in 1789, or for centuries
previously.
The judicial power of the United States was organized to
comprehend all cases that might properly arise under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, and, in addition, cases of whi6h, friom the character of the parties, the decision might involve the peace and harmony of the Union.
This principle was accepted without dissent among- the framers
of the Constitution. The clause "all cases of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction" appears in the draught of the Constitution imputed to Charles Pinckney, and submitted at a very early
stage of the session of the Convention. It was reported by the
committee of detail in their first report, and was adopted without debate. In one of the sittings, in an incidental discussion,
Mr. Wilson, of Pennsylvania, remarked: "That the admiralty
jurisdiction ought to be given wholly to the National Government, as
it related to cases not within the jurisdictionof a particularState, and
to a SCEINE in which controversy with foreigners would be most likely
to happen." (2 Mad. De., 799.) No other observation in the
Convention illustrates this clause.
The judiciary clause is expounded in the numbers of the
Federalist, by Alexander Hamilton.
He says, the judicial power extends-ist, to all those cases
which arise out of the laws of the United States, passed in pursuance of their just and constitutional powers of legislation;
2d, to all those which concern the execution of the provisions
expressly contained in the Articles of Union; 3d, to all those
in which the United States are a party; 4th, to all those which
involve the peace of the Confederacy, whether they relate to
the intercourse between the United States and foreign nations,
or to that between the States themselves; 5th, to all those which
originate on the high seas, and are of admiralty or maritime
jurisdiction; and, lastly, to all those in which the State tribunals cannot be supposed to be unbiassed and impartial.
In regard to the 5th class, he says: "The most bigoted idolizers of State authority have not thus far shown a disposition
to deny the national judiciary the cognizance of maritime

causes. These so generally depend on the laws of .natibns,
and so commonly ffect the rights of foreigners, that they fall
within the, considerations relative to> the public peace. The
most important ofthem are, by the present Confederation, submitted to Federal jurisdiction.".
Similar remarks are to be found in. the debates in various of
the Conventions of the States which adopted the Constitution,.
as incidentally occurring.. In none of the Conventions was the
judiciary clause of the Constitution considerately examined,
except in Virginia; .and in the Convention of Virginia no objection was made to this clause. Gov. Randolph said there,
that "cases of admiralty and maritiiir6 jurisdiction cannot .with
propriety be vested in particular State courts. As our iational
tranquillity, reputation, and intercourse with foreign nations,
may be affected by admiralty decision , as they ought therefore to be uniform, and as there can be no uniforiaity if there
be thirteen distinct independent jurisdictions, the jurisdiction
ought to be in the Federal- judiciary." Mr. Madison, in a
luminous exposition of the article, expressed a similar opinion.
He said: "The same reasons snpportdd the grant of admiralty
jurisdiction as existed in the grant of cognizance of causes affecting ambassadors and foreign ministers." "As our intercourse with foreign natibts will be affected by decisions of this
kind, they ought to be uniform." In the same speech, this
statesman affirmed, that all .controversies directly between citizen
and citizen will still remain with the local courts. And after the
Constitution was adopted, we filiad Chief Justice Jay, in analyzing the judicial power of the United States, and assigning
reasons for the grant, says of this portion of it, "because, as
the seas are the joint property of nations, whose rights and
privileges relative thereto are regulated by the law of nations
and treaties, such cases necessarily belong to a ndtional jurisdiction." The instance jurisdiction of the court, now the object of such ambition and interest, and involving questions so
threatening, was hardly referred to by the ftiends of the Constitution, and not an alarn was expressed by any of ifs vigilant and jealous opponents. The prize jurisdiction of the
court--that which concerned the foreign relations of the Union
in war or in peace, and which is so intimately related to the
honor and dignity of the country-was in the minds of all those
statesmen who referred to the subject.
It did not enter the imagination of any opponent of the Constitution to conceive that a jurisdiction which for centuries had
been sternly repelled from the body of any county could, by
any authority, artifice, or device, assume a.jurisdiction through
the whole extent of every lake and water-course within the

limits of the United States. The collision described in the
libel of the appellants occurred at a place which in 1789 formed
a part of the State of Georgia. Had a similar cause then arisen,
I can affirm with perfect safety that not an individual member
of any Convention, whether State or Federal, who was concerned in the makinig or the ratifying of the Constitution, would
have admitted the existence of an admiralty jurisdiction over
the case. Such being the facts, I affirm that no change in the
opinion of men, nor in the condition of the country, nor any
apparent expediency, can render that constitutional which those
who made the Constitution did not design to be so.
"If any of the provisions of the Constitution are deemed
unjust," said the Chief Justice, in Scott v. Sandford, 19 How.,
893, "there is a mode prescribed in the instrument itself by
which it may be amended; but, while it remains unaltered, it
must be construed as it was understood at the time of its adoption. It is not only the same in words, but the same in meaning, and delegates the same powers to the Government, and
secures the same rights and privileges to the citizen; and as
long as it continues to exist in its present form, it speaks not
only in the same words, but with the same meaning with which
it spake when it came from the hands of its framers, and was
voted on and adopted by the people of the United States.
That the framers of the Constitution designed to secure to
the Federal Government a plenary control over all maritime
questions arising in their intercourse. with foreign nations,
whether of peace or war, which assumed a juridical form
through courts of its own appointment, is more than probable
from the instrument and the contemporary expositions I have
quoted. This was the primary and designed object of the
authors of the Constitution in granting this jurisdiction. It is
likewise probable that the jurisdiction which had been exercised from th6 infancy of the colonies to the reign of George
III, by courts of admiralty, under laws of navigation, trade,
and revenue, was considered as forming a legitimate branch of
the admiralty jurisdiction. Such was the opinion of the First
Congress under the Constitution, and it has been confirmed in
this court. (8 Dall., 897; 2 Cr., 405; 4 Cr., 448; 2 H., 210.)
If the instance jurisdiction of the court was at all remembered,
the reminiscence was not of a nature to create alarm. The
cases for its employment were few and defined. Those did
not depend upon any purely municipal code, nor affect any
question of public or political interest. They related for the
most part to transactions at a distance, which did not involve
the interests nor attract the observation of any considerable
class of persons. -No one could imagine that this jurisdiction,

.Tackson et al. v. Steamboat Magnolia.

by the interpretation of those who were to exercise it, could
penetrate wherever a vessel of ten tons might enter within any
of the States.
The question arises, what are the power and jurisdiction
claimed for the courts of the United States by this reversal of
the judgment of the District Court of Alabama?The Supreme Court requires that court to take cognizance
of cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction that arise on
lakes and on rivers, as if they were high seas. Dunlap, defining the constitutional jul-risdiction in 1885, said, that "it comprehends all maritime contracts, torts, and injuries. The latter branch ip necessarily bounded by locality; the former extends over all contracts, whensoever they may be made and
executed, or whatever may be the form of the stipulation which
relates to the navigation, business, or commerce of the sea."
(Dunlap's Pr., 43.)
This was the broad pretension for the admiralty set up by
.Mr. Justice Story, in Delovie v. Boit, in 1815, under which the
legal profession and this court staggered for thirty years before
being able to maintain it. The definition to be deduced from
the present decision deprives that of any significance.- That
affords no description of the subject.
The definition under this decree, if carried to its logical extent, will run thus: "That the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the courts of the United States extends to all cases
of contracts, torts, and injuries, which arise in or concern the
navigation, commerce, or business of citizens of the United
States, or persons commorant therein, on any of the navigable
waters of the world."
I proceed now to examine the jurisprudence of the courts of
the United States, to ascertain the various stages in the progress to the goal which has been to-day attained. The tendency of opinion in the first years of the existence of the Union
was to limit the admiralty jurisdiction according the constitution of the British court of admiralty. Justice Washington so
declared in 1806; United States v. McGill, 4 Dall., 895; and his
learned successor maintained the same doctrine. (Bald. R., 544.)
This opinion was assailed by Justice Story in Delovio v.Bolt,
2 Gall., 395, in the year 1815.
The question of jurisdiction arose on a libel founded on a
policy, of insprance, and the jurisdiction of the court was sustained. I believe I express a general, if not universal, opinion
of the legal, profession, in saying that this judgment was erroneous. T understand Justice Curtis to intimate the existence
of such an opinion in the Gloucester T.surance Company v.'
Younger, 2 Curt. R., 822.
-

SUPREME COURT.
.Tackgon et al. v. Steamboat Haqn6lia.

The opinion of Justice Story, in the cause of Delovio v. Boit,
is celebrated for its research, and remarkable, in my opinion,
for its boldness in asserting novel conclusions, and the facility
with which authentic historical evidence that contradicted
them is disposed of. The examination of the English authorities resulted in the following conclusions.
In the construction of the statutes of Richard HI and Henry
IV, "the admiralty has uniformly and without hesitation," he
says, "maintained that they were never intended to, abridge or
restrain the rightful jurisdiction of the court; that they meant
to take away any pretence of entertaining suits upon contracts
arising wholly upon land, and referring solely to terrene affairs; and. upon torts or injuries which, though arising in ports,
were not done within the ebb and flow of the tide; and that
the language of these statutes, as well as the manifest object
thereof, as stated in the preambles, and in the petitions on
which they were founded, is fully satisfied by this exposition.
So that, consistently with the statutes, the admiralty may still
exercise jurisdiction: 1. Over torts and injuries upon the high
seas, and in ports within the ebb and flow of the tide, and in
great streams below the first bridges; 2. Over all maritime
contracts arising at home or abroad; 3. Over matters of prize
and its incidents." In regard to the conclusions of the courts
of common law he says:
That the common-law interpretation of these statutes abridges
the jdirisdiction to things wholly done on the sea. 2. That
the common-law interpretation of these statutes is indefensible
upon principle, and the decisions founded upon it are ineonsistent and unsatisfactory. 3. That the interpretation of
the same statutes does-not abridge any of its ancient jurisdiction, but leaves to it cognizance of all maritime contracts, torts,
injuries, and-offences upon the high seas, and in ports as far
as the ebb and flow of the tide. 4. That this is the true limit
of the admiralty jurisdiction, on principle.

In regard to the

case of the -collision between ships and steamboats, we have
the authoritative declaration of the judge of the admiralty. I
have cited it to show that this statement of the English law is
not accurate. And Sir John Kicholl, in the same court, in 3
Hagg., 257, 283, differs materially from other portions of the
same statement. It may be true that the English court of admiralty, with the approbation of the King, took cognizance
of causes arising within the limits of Englandr in despite of
the prohibition by Parliament. But the great charter, and
other statutes of importance to the liberties of the realm,
were also violated by the same authority. It is also true
that the twelve judges of England, a:ad the attorney gen-

DECEMBER TERM, 1857.
.Tackon et al.v. Steamboat Magnolia.

eral, in the presence of the King and the Privy Council,
after solemn debate, in 1632, signed an agreement to concede
to the admiralty a larger jurisdiction. But such an act was
illegal, and by the Judges extra-judicial. Ten of those judges,
four years later, presided in the case against Hampden for ship
money; the attorney general was the inventor of the writ for
its levy; the Privy Council was that which Strafford and Laud
had organized to rule England without a Parliament, and which
was made hateful by its arbitrary and violent proceedings.
And the contract itself was denounced as unconstitutional by
Lord Coke, who, but a few-years before, had prepared the
Petition of Right in which the legal constitution of England
was embodied. For all contracts, pleas, and quarrels, made and
done upon a river, haven, or creek, within the realm of England, he said, "the Admiral, without question, hath not jurisdiction, for then he should hold plea of things done within the
body of the county, which are triable by verdict of twelve men,
and merely determinable by the common law, and not within
the admiralty and by the civil law; for that were to change
and alter the law in such cases." (4 Co. Inst., 135.) And
finally, in 1640, to close the door upon all such attempts of the
King and his Privy Council, the fifth section of the act "For
the regulating of the Privy Council, and for taking away the
court commonly'called- the Star Chamber," which I have already quoted, was adopted.
The great and controlling question of contest in this long
period of contest was as to the supremacy of the Parliament,
and a very important form of that question related to its organization of the courts and its regulation of their jurisdictioi.
When the supremacy of Parliament bad been established -by
the Revolution, its enactments which had defined the constitutional limits of the courts of judicature were no longer opposed or contradicted. The error of the opinion iii D,elovio v.
B oit, on this subject, in my judgment, consists in its adoption
of the harsh and acrimonious censures of discarded and discomfited civilians on the conduct of the great patriots of England, whose courage, sagacity, and patriotism, secured the rights
of her people, as any evidence of historical facts.
But the royal ordinances-of Louis XIV unquestionably afford that support to the decision and opinion in that case which
cannot be found in the English law. The policy of insurance
is enumerated among the contracts submitted to the French
courts of admiralty, and the formulary in which the jurisdiction
as to torts and offences is expressed in the opinion is a free
translation from the French ordinances. I refer to the opinion

exposition of the system which its authorafterwards introduced
as the doctrine of the court, in.the Thomas Jefferson, in 1825;
Orleans v. P h ebus, in 1837; and Coombs's case, in 1838; and
which was more fully sanctioned in the opinions of the court
in subsequent cases; and- because he defends in that opinion
the jurisdiction of the admiralty upon grounds which are
not to be reconciled with the opinion of the court in the present
cause.
In the Steamboat Orleans v. Phcebus, 11 Pet., 173, decided
in 1835, the court say: "The true test of jurisdiction is, whether
the vessel be engaged substantially in maritime navigation, or in
interior navigation and trade, not on tide-waters. In the latter
case there is nojurisdiction." In the United States v. Coombs, 12
Pet., 73, the direct question arose as to the limits of thisjurisdiction. The court answers, as in former cases, "That in cases purely dependent upon the locality of the act done, it is limited to the
sea and to tide-waters as far as the tide flows; and that it does
not reach beyond high-water mark. It is the doctrine repeatedly asserted by this court, and we see no reason to depart
from it." In Waring v. Clark, 5 How., 441, the same question was again considered by the court. The claimants of the
largest extent of jurisdiction for the court expressed their
opinion through Mr. Justice Wayne. He cited the former
decisions with approbation, and said that the question was no
longer open in the court; "that it was res judicata in this
court." Again, in 1848, Mr. Justice Nelson, expressing the
views of the four judges who concurred with Justice Wayne
in the former case, (New Jersey Steam Navigation Company
v. Merchants' Bank, 6 How., 344,) disclaimed jurisdiction over
"contracts growing out of the purely internal commerce of
the State, as well as commerce beyond tide-waters," stating
that "they are generally domestic in their origin and operation,
and could hardly have been intended to be drawn within the
cognizance of the Federal courts." I think it is manifest, that
had the case before the court been produced before it ten years
ago, it would hav.e been unanimously dismissed for the want
ofjurisdiction. From the decision in the Thomas Jefferson,
in 1825, to that of the New Jersey Navigation Company v.
the Merchants' Bank, in 1848, two generations of judges have
agreed to doctrines wholly irreconcilable with the judgment
now given.
In 1851, the case of the Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How.,
443, came before the court. It was a cause of collision between
steamboats navigating Lake Ontario, and engaged in the commerce of different States. The District Court exercised jurisdiction under the act of February, 1845, (5 Stat. at L., 726,)

DEOEMBER TERM, 1857.
-Jacksonetal. v. Steamboat Magnolia.

which provided for such cases on the lakes, and navigable
waters connected with them, in the same manner as if the same
vessels had been employed in navigating the high seas or on
fide-waters within the admiralty jurisdiction, with a proviso
that all the issues of fact might be tried by a jury.
The court decided that the act was not a regulation of commerce between the States, and that the jurisdiction conferred
on the District Court could not be sustained as a regulation of
commerce among the States, and that the judicial power of the
United States could not be extended by such legislation. The
court, after this sound constitutional argument, proceed to say:
"If the meaning of these terms in the Constitution was now for
the first time brought before this court, there could, we think, be
no hesitation in sayingthatthelakes and their connectingwaters
were embraced in them. - These lakes are, in truth, inland
seas. Different States border on them on one side, and a foreign nation on the other; a great and growing commerce between different States and a foreign nation, which is subject
to all the incidents and hazards that attend commerce on the
ocean. Hostile fleets have encountered in them, and prizes
have been made; and every reason which-,xists for the grant
of admiralty jurisdiction to the General Government on the
Atlantic seas, applies with equal force to the lakes. There is
an equal necessity for the instance power, and for the prize
power of 'theadmiralty court to administer. dmiralty law; and
if the one cannot be established, neither can be the other."
All the considerations mentioned in this argument applied
to the Mississippi river in 1789, and some of them do at this
time.
I have stated the entire argument of the court upon the
precise'question, whether the court had jurisdiction of the
cause for damage in that locality. The court say, "the only
objection made to the jurisdiction is, that there is no tide in
the lakes, or the waters connecting them; and it is said that
the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, as known anid understood in Enrland and this country at the time the Constitution
.was adoptea', was confined to the ebb and flow of the tide."
The Chief Justice combats this objection to the jurisdiction of
.the court in that cause, and pronounces for the court that tide
does not form the criterion of jurisdiction. In my opinion, the
argument of the court in favor of jurisdiction is imposing; and
also that the objection taken by the appell2.nts, as reported in
the opinion, does not embody the strength of the objection to
ithe jurisdiction. To ascertain'the scope of the opinion, it is
necessary to examine the argument of the court, and the worth
of the objection taken to the jurisdiction and combated.

SUREME COURT.
Aclon et al. v. Steamboat Magnolia.

The lakes are-certainly not seas according to the signiftation of that word in the law of nations or the Admiral's commission. They are not common highways for all
nations, open to the ships of all, and exempted from the municipal regulation and cofitrol of any. The sovereignty over
them belongs to the riparian proprietors, in the same manner
as over the Rhine or Rio Grande rivers; and the American
States and British Queen have respectively courts to administer their laws within the limits of their several titles, to the
middle of the lakes, against those who may offend against
them. The jurisdiction of the court of admiralty cannot be
supported upon the lakes as seas. But the lakes form an external maritime boundary of the United States, and are a commercial highway, which by treaty is common to the inhabitants
of the two maritime and commercial countries whose possessions border them. The commerce of these countries is great
and growing, and exposed to depredation; and in the absence
of a navy, and without defined boundaries, the police of the
States on this exposed frontier may be inefficient for the protection of the interests of the Union. I shall not inquire
whether these considerations, or those among them which are
applicable to the river Mississippi, authorized the decisions in
the Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How.; and Fritz v. Bull,
12 How., 466; Walsh v. Rogers, 13 How., 283. I have yielded
to the principle of stare decisis, and have applied the decisions
as I found them when I came into this court. But not one of
these considerations has any application to the case before this
court. The Alabama river is not an inland sea. Its navigation was not open to a single foreign vessel when this collision
took place. No port had been established on it by the authority of Congress. The commerce that passes over it consists
mainly of the products of the State, and the objects received
in exchange, at the only seaport of the State.. For its whole
length it is subject to the same State Government, and its
police does not involve a necessity for a navy.
The objection noticed in the opinion of the court in theGenesee Chief; as opposed in the argument against the jurisdiction
of the court, I have said does not meet the force of the adversary opinion. In France, the domain of the Admiral was limited to the sea, its coasts, ports, havens, and shores to the highwater mark, and his seignoral right to dispense justice was
confined to his domain. The contest there was as to the extent of rival seignories. But in Great Britain the contest had
a more profound significance than is to be found in a controversy merely between rival feudatories.
The Admiral's jurisdiction there had no relation to the salt-

ness or freshness of the waters, nor whether the rivers were
public or private, navigable or floatable. The question was,
whether Englishmen should be governed by English laws, or
"whether contracts, pleas, and quarrels, should be drawn ad
aid ezamen, and be sentenced per ali kgem." The English
Commons abhorred the summary jurisdiction of the courts of
civil law, their private examination of witnesses, their rejection
of a. jury of the vicinage, the discretion they allowed to the
judge, and their foreign code. They erected a barrier of penal
statutes to exclude them from the body of any county, either
on land or water.
The people of the several States have retained the popular
element of the judicial administration of England, and the attachment of her people-to the institutions of local self-government. In Alabama, the "trial by jury is preserved inviolate,"
that being regarded as "an essential principle of liberty and
free government." In the court of admiralty the people have
no place As jurors. A single judge, deriving his appointment
from an independent Government, administers in that court a
code which a Federal judge has described as "resting upon
the general principles of maritimelaw, and that it is not competent to the States, by any local legislation, to enlarge, or
limit, or narrow it." (2 Story R., 456.)
If the principle of this dec.ree is carried to its logical extent,
all cases arising in the transportation of property or persons
from the towns and landing-places of the different States, to
other towns and landing-places, whether in or out of the State;
all cases of tort or damage arising in the navigation of the internal waters,'whether involving the security of persons or title
to property, in either; all cases of supply to those engaged in
the navigation, not to enumerate others, will be cognizable in
the District Courts of the -United States. If the dogma of
judges in regard to the system of laws to be administered prevails, then this ,whole class of cases may be drawn ad aliud examen, and placed under the dominion of a foreign code, whether
they arise among citizens or others. The States are deprived of
the power to mould their own laws in respect of persons and
things within their limits, and which are appropriately subject
to their sovereignty. The right of the people to self-government is thus abridged-abridged to the precise extent, that a
judge appointed by another Government may impose a law, not
sanctioned by the representatives or agents of the people, upon
the citizens of the State. Thus the contest here assumes the
same significance as in Great Britain, and, in its last analysis,
involves the question of the right of the people to determine
their own laws and legal institutions. And surely this objec-

SUPREME COURT.
.Tacon et al. v. Steamboat Magnolia.

tion to the decree is independent of any consideration whether
the river is subject to tides, or is navigable from the sea.
This decree derives no strength from the legislation of Congress, but a strong argument is to be deduced from the act of
1845 in opposition to it. The learned author of the opinion
in Delovio v. Boit, and in the case of the Thomas Jefferson,
(Justice Story,) has the reputation of being the author of the
act. He proposed to bring under the judicial administration
of the United States, cases that did not belong to the jurisdiction of the admiralty undQr the authoritative expoqition of the
Constitution by this court. The first suggestion of the feasibility of such a law is to be found in the opinion given in the
case of the Thomas Jefferson, in 1825, and is enough to relieve
this court from the imputation of having decided that case
without a proper appreciation of the magnitude of the question.
The act of 1845 involves the admission, that cases arising on
waters within the limits of the United States other than tidewaters were cases at common law, and that a jury, under the
seventh amendment of the Constitution, must be preserved.
It was framed on the hypothesis that Congress might increase
the judicial power of the United States, so as to comprise all
cases arising on, or which related to, any subject to which its
legislation extended. It is apparent that this court in 1847,
and afterwards in 1848, when the suits of Waring v. Clark,
and the New Jersey.Navigation Co. v. The Merchants' Bank,
were so elaborately discussed, were wholly unconscious of the
fact that this act contained a recognition of any jurisdiction in
admiralty, additional to what had been previously exercised.
The only inference that can be drawn properly from the act
of 1845, in my opinion; is, that Congress recognised the limit
that the decisions in the earlier cases in this court had established for the admiralty and maritime .jurisdiction, and its own
incapacity to confer a more enlarged jurisdiction of that kind.
I have performed my duty, in my opinion, in expressing at
large my convictions on the subject of the powers of the courts
of the United States under the clause of the Constitution I
have considered.
There have been cases, since I came into this court, involving the jurisdiction of the court on the seas and their tidewaters, the lakes, and the Mississippi river. I have applied
the law as settled in previous decisions, in deference to the
principle of stare decisis, without opposing any objectionthough in a portion of those decisions the reasons of the court
did not satisfy my own judgment. I consider that the present
case carries the jurisdiction to an incalculable extent beyond
any other, and all others, that have heretofore been pronounced,

and that it must create a revolution in the admiralty administration of the courts of the United States; that the change will
produce heart-burning and discontent, and involve collisions
with State Legislatures and State jurisdictions. And, finally,
it is a violation of the rights reserved in the Constitution of
the United States to the'States and the people.

TIMOTHY S. GOODMAN,

PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V. JOHN SIMONS.

Where an accepted and endorsed bill of exchange was placed by the drawer as
collateral security for his own debt in the hands of his creditor, and when the
creditor came to sue the acceptor, the court instructed the jury, "that if such2
facts and circumstances were known to the plaintiff as caused him to suspect, or
that would have caused one of ordinary prudence to suspect, that the drawer had
no interest in the bill, and no authority to use the same for his own benefit, and
by ordinary diligence he could have ascertained these facts," then the jury would
find for the defendant-this instruction was erroneous.
The facts of the case examined, to ascertain whether or not there was sufficient
evidence to go to the jury upon these points.
This court again says, that a bonafide holder of a negotiable instrument for a valuable consideration, without notice of facts which impeach its validity between
the antecedent parties, if he takes it under an endorsement made before the same
becomes due, holds the title unaffected by these facts, and may recover thereon,
although as between the antecedent parties the transaction may be without any
legal valldity.
Where a party is in possession of a negotiable instrument, the presumption is that
he holds it for value, and the burden of proof is upon him who disputes it; an
exception being where the defect appears on the face of the instrument.
Itis a question of fact for the jury, whether or not the holder had knowledge-of
defects existing antecedently to the transfer to him.
The English and American cases examined.
Surrendering collateral securities previously given, and affording increased indulgence as to time, furnish a sufficient consideration for the transfer of new col-"
laterals.
