JOHN SIGERSON, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V. EDWARD MATHEWS.
Where the endorser of a promissory note, in conversation with the agent of the
holder, before its maturity, dispensed with a presentation of the note and demand of payment, and promised to pay it, or provide for its payment, at maturity, he could not, when sued, set up as a defence that the note was not presented
foi payment, and demand made therefor when it was due, and that no notice of
its dishonor was given.
If, after the maturity of the note, the endorser promised the agent of the holder to
pay the same, having, at the time of making such promise, knowledge of the
fact that the note had not been presented for payment, and no demand made
therefor, or notice of non-payment, he could not, when sued, set up as a defence
awant of such demand or notice.

THIS case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit
Dourt of the United States for the district of Missouri.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
It was argued by Mr. Cushing and MWr. Gillet for the plaintiff
in error, and by Mr. Blair for the defendant.
The points made by the counsel for the plaintiff in error
were the following:
.First. The note in question was not an accommodation note,
made for the defendant.
The evidence shows that there could be no pretence that the
note in question was made for the accommodation of the defendant; but that it was, in fact, a regular business note, taken
by defendant on the sale of real estate, without security. And
that when, at a subsequent day, the property was re-deeded,
and the remainder of the notes given up, the defendant credited
this particular note on another debt (account) due him from
James Sigerson, the maker. When it was given, and when it
was transferred, the defendant must have confidently expected
that it would be paid by the maker. When he took back the
property, and credited the note to the maker, he clearly relied
upon its being paid by the maker,,or he would not have given
him credit for it until he had actually taken it up, or he have
been discharged from it as endorser.

Second. Unless the defendant agreed, unconditionally, after
the note became due, and after he knew that the note had not
been presented, for payment, to pay said note, he was not liable
therefor.
The note not having been made for the defendant's accommodation, he could only be made liable by presentation at the
bank, demand of payment, and notice of non-payment. His
liability depended upon the holder taking the steps required by
law to charge him. If they had been taken, his liability became
fixed by them, but otherwise not. If he supposed they had not
been taken, and that he had been inade liable, and acted under
a mistake in relation to the facts, he would not be bound by
such action when the real facts are developed.
If he made
any promise, on misapprehension of the facts, lhe is not bound
by it, because the inducement to make it was unreal, and was
not what it appeared to. be. A promise under such circumstances has nothing t6 stand upon. There is no evidence that
the note had been presented to the bank, or that any steps
whatever had been taken to charge the endorser; nor does it
appear that the defendant had been informed of the true state
of the facts in relation thereto at the time of the conversation,
which is now claimed to be a promise of payment;
In Thornton v. Wynn, 12 Wheat., 183, it was held that
where the promisle or agreement was not unequivocal, it would
not authorize a recovery.
Third. An agreement to pay the debt of a third person by
an-end6rser, where the note was not presented at the time and
place of payment, and notice of non-payment duly given,
unless made and signed -by the party to*be charged, upon a
consideration specified therein, is not binding, and cannot be
enforced.
Fourth. The suggestion by the defendant to the plaintiff's
agent, that he need not, prove the note against the estate of
James Sigerson, and that it would be paid at maturity, created
no'liability on the part of the defendant.
The liability of the defendant did not'depend upon the probating of the note, nor did the remark that it would be paid at
maturity amount to a kpromise to pay. It implied that there
wbuld be Tunds ready to take it up at the time and place of
payment, and nothino more. The inference was, that the
means would be supphed by those whose duty it would be to
provide for the payment.
Nor did the suggestion to Elder tend to show that a presentation, demand of payment, and notice of non-payment, were
dispensed with. The remark that the note would be paid at
maturity seems to imply that the defendant expected the note

would be paid at maturity, on being presented in the usual
course of business. It clearly implied that it was expected,
when it matured, it would be presented somewhere to be
paid; and as no place or person was named, the time and place
named in the note must have been intended. It follows, that
there was no waiver by the defendant of the condition of presentation, demand, and notice of non-payment, prior to its
falling due.
The defendant did not occasion the omission of that necessary duty in order to create a liability on his part. Nothing
was said on that subject. The plaintiff's agent was left to take
such steps as his principal directed, or that he deemed expedient, and.the plaintiff must abide the consequences.
Fifth. The court erred in instructing the jury upon questions not raised by the evidence.
Mr. Blair said:
The principle declared by the court amounts only to this, as
has been said in a similar case, (that of the Taunton Bank v.
Richardson, 5 Pickering, 436,) that a party may dispense with
conditions for his benefit; and it has been applied in many cases
similar to this. (See Dinkwater v. Tibbatts, 5 Shepley, p. 16;
Boyd v. Cleveland, 4 Pickering; Marshall v. Mitchell, 35
Maine, 221; Thornton v. Wynn, 12 Wheat., 183; and the Union
Bank of Georgetown v. Magruder, 7 Pet., 287. See also Story

Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a writ of error to the Circuit Court for the district
of Missouri.
An action was brought by Mathews against John Sigerson,
as endorser on a note of James Sigerson, now deceased, dated
the 10th of March, 1852, for the payment of the sum of two
thousand dollars, two years after date, at the Bank of the State
of Missouri, with interest from the date.
It was proved on the trial that, in 1851, Mathews advanced
largely to John Sigerson on. some transactions in pork, whereby Sigerson became indebted to him in the sum of two thousand dollars; that Sigerson wanted two years' time, on which
Mathews required a mortgage an real estate as security; but
Sigerson offered to give the note of his brother James, endorsed by himself, instead of the mortgage; and he repre-

sented that his brother James was the owner of a valuable real
estate near St.*Louis; which offer was accepted, and the note
was given.
Some time in the fall of 1852, Joseph E. Elder, a witness,
received the note from Mathews for collection, soon after the
death of James Sigerson, and before the note became due.
Witness called on John Sigerson, and asked'him if . e should.
have the note protested against the estate-of James Sigerson.
He replied, that the witness need not do so, and that the note
should be paid at maturity. The witness then placed the note
in his portfolio, where it, remained until after due. After it
was due, witness called on John Sigerson, and informed him that'
he bad neglected to put the note in bank for collection, and
asked him what he was going to do; he said he would see
witness in a few days, and arrange it. Afterwards Sigerson
said to the witness that he did not consider himself liable as
endorser, as the note had not been protested.
In February, 1852, John Sigerson sold his interest in the,
T
farm near St. Louis, which was one-half of it, and which contained about one thousand acres, to James Sigerson, who was
to pay off the encumbrances on the land, which amounted to

about sixteen thousand dollars. James executed twenty notes
for two thousand dollars each, payable in six, twelve, and
eighteen months;'and John Sigerson made him a deed. In
July, 1852, James reconveyed the land to John, and the bargain was rescinded. .This was done because James. had not
led his coitract. Nineteen of the notes were given up,
but the note now in suit was not surrendered, and for which
the account of James was credited on the books of John.
James, on hig decease, left'no property.
On the above facts, the court charged the jury, "if they believe, from the evidence, that, before the maturity of the note,
in conversation with the agent of the plaintiff, the defendant
dispensed with a presentation of the note and demand of payment, and promised to pay it or provide for its payment at
miaturity, he cannot now set up as a defence to this suit, that
the note was not presented for payment, and demand made
therefor, when it 'was due, and that no notice of its dishonor
iwas given."
That, "if, after the maturity- of the note, the defendant
promised the plaintiff or his agent to pay the same, having
at.the time of making said promise knowledge of the 'fact that
the note had not been presented for payment, and that no demand had been made therefor, or notice of non-payment given,
the defendant cannot now set up, as a defence to said note, a
want of such demand or notice."

SUPREME COURT.
Sigerson v. Mathews.

"If the defendant dispensed neither with the presentation
of the note and uotice, n6r promised to pay the same, having
knowledge as above stated, the plaintiff cannot recover."
Exception was taken to these instructions.
Certain instructions were asked by the defendant, which
were refused; but it is unnecessary to state them, as they are
substantially embraced in those given by the court.
As there was no formal demand of payment, nor protest
for non-payment and notice, those requisites must have been
waived by the defendant, to make him responsible as endorser;and to this effect were the instructions of the court; and we
think the testimony not only authorized the instructions given,
but also the verdict rendered by the jury. Before the note
was due, the defendant said to Elder, the agent of Mathews,
and who held the note, that he need not tae steps to collect
it from the estate of his brother James, as it should be paid at
maturity. This was an assurance which could not be mistaken, and it was relied on by the agent. He placed the note in
his portfolio, where it remained until after it became due.
After this, the agent called on the defendant, and informed him
that he had neglected to take measures for the collection of
the note, and asked him what he was going to do; he answered, that in a few days he would see the witness, and arrange it. This was an unconditional promise to pay the note,
Which no one could- misunderstand, and which he could not
repudiate at any subsequent period.
A promise by an endorser to pay a note or bill, dispenses
with the necessity of proving a demand on the maker or
drawer, or notice to himself. (Pierson v. Hooker, 8 Johns.,
68; Hopkins v. Liswell, 12 Mass. Rep., 52.) Where the drawer
of a protested bill, on being applied to for payment on behalf
of the holder, acknowledged the debt to be due, and promised
to pay it, saying nothing about notice, it was. held, that the
holder was not bound to prove notice on the trial. (Walker
v. Laverty, 6 Manf., 487.) An unconditional promise by the
endorser of a bill to pay it, or an acknowledgment of his liability, and knowledge of his discharge by the laches of the
holder, will amount to an implied waiver -of due notice of a
demand of the drawee, acceptor, or maker. (Thornton v.
Wynn, 12 Wheat., 188; Bank of Georgetown v. Magruder, 7
Pet., 287.) We think the instructions of the court were correct,
and that, consequently, the judgment must be affirmed, with
costs.
