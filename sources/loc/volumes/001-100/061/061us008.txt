and judgment in granting and allowing the pre-emption rights
to and in the name of Samuel Hemphill was final and conclusive, and cannot be inquired into, or in any manner questioned,
modified, or set aside.
This matter was put ih issue; and the court below, when it
decreed for the complainant, necessarily decided against the
bar to relief set up and claimed under an authority of the
United States.
The question is, have the courts of justice power to examine
a contested claim to a right of entry under the pre-emption
laws, and to overrule the decision of the register and receiver,
confirmed by the Commissioner, in a case where they have
been imposed upon by ex parte affidavits, and the patent has
been obtained by one having no interest secured to him in
virtue of the pre-emption laws, to the destruction of another's
right, who had a preference of entry, which he preferred and
exerted in due form, but which right was defeated by false
swearing and fraudulent contrivance brought about by him
to whom the patent was awarded?
The general rule is, that where several parties set up conflicting claims to property, with which a special tribunal may
deal, as between one party and the Government, regardless of
the rights of others, the latter may come into the ordinary
courts of justice, and litigate the conflicting claims. Such was
the case of Comegys v. Vasse, (1 Peters, 212,) and the case
before us belongs to the same class of ex parte proceedings; nor
do the regulations of the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, whereby a party may be heard to prove his better claim to
enter, oust the jurisdiction of the courts of justice. Wr announce this to be the settled doctrine of this court.
It was, in effect, so held in the case of Lytle v. The State of
Arkansas, (9 How., 328;) next, in the case of Cunningham v.
Ashley, (14 How.;) and again in the case of Bernard v. Ashley,
(18 How., 44.)
It is ordered that the decree of the Supreme Court of Arkansas be in all things affirmed.

Where a person was born at Goliad, then in the State of Coahuila and Texas,
being a part of the Republic of Mexico, which place was also the domicil of her
father and mother until their deaths, and was removed at the age of four years,
before the declaration of Texan independence, to Matamoras, in Mexico, this person is an alien, and can sue in the courts of the United States.

Ber allegiance remained unchanged, unless by her election, which it was incumbent on the opposite party to show.
According to general principles, mere alienage .did not forfeit a title to land, in
Texas; and although the Constitution of Texas provided that no alien should
hold land in Texas, except by title emanating directly from the Government of
that Republic, yet it was afterwards declared that the Legislature should, by
law, provide a method for determining what lands may have been forfeited or
escheated.
In the absence of such a legislative provision, a title emanating from the Government of Mexico, anterior to Texan independence, is not forfeited,
In a court of law, where a grant from the Government is in regular form, it is
not proper to inquire into the'voidability of the grant from equitable considerations.

Tins case was brought up, by writ of error, from the District
Court of the United States for the district of Texas.
The case is stated in the opinion of the court..
It was argued.by .Xr.Jale for the plaintiffs in error, and by
.Mr.Hughes for the defendant.
The principal question in the case was, whether- Catherine
McMasters was a citizen of Mexico or of Texas. The arguments of the counsel upon this point were as follows:
Mr.Hale's first point was this: ,
The District Court should not have sustained the demurrer
to the plea to the jurisdiction pleaded by John R. Tally. It
appeared by the allegations of that plea that the plaintiff was,
at the time of the institution of th suit, a citizen of the State
of Texas. The Constitution of the Republic of Texas declared
that "all persons (Africans, the descendants of Africans, and
Indians, excepted) who, were residing in Texas on the day of
the declaration of independence, shall be considered citizens
of the Republic, and entitled to all the privileges of such."
(Const. Rep. Gen. Prov., see. 10; Hart. Dig., p. 38.) And the
incorporation of the Republic of Texas into the Union, "on
an equal footing with the original States in every respect,"
necessarily converted the citizens of the Republic of Texas
into citizens of the State of Texas and of the United States.
(Joint Resolution for annexing Texas to the United States,
arch 1, 1845, 5 Stat. at L., 797; act of Dec. 29, 1845, 6 Stat.
at L., 1.) It follows, that any person who, within the meaning
of the Constitution of the Republic, resided in Texas at the time
of the declaration of independence, and continued thus to be
a citizen of the Repub lic until the period of annexation to the
United States, became thereby a citizen of the State, of Texas,
and was not competent to bring a suit, in the Distriet'Court of
the United States, against other citizens of the same State.
The only point which presents any difficulty is in relation to

10

SUPREME COURT.
.kne et al. v. McMazters.

the meaning of the phrase, "who were residing in Texas," used
in the Constitution of the Republic. There can be little doubt,
however, that the framers of the Constitution intended this
phrase to be equivalent to the corresponding one, "who had
their domicil in Texas," and did not design to deprive of
their citizenship those who were physically absent from the
country. Many of the most respectable and deserving residents of Texas were not, personally, within the limits of the
Republic at the date of the declaration of independence.
They had been forced to leave the country, temporarily, by
the advance of the Mexican army; they had accompanied their
suffering families to the refuge offered by the United States,
on the eastern bank of the Sabine; they had been sent on
missions by the General Council, to arouse the sympathies of
the Western States; they had returned to their former homes,
to bring their wives and children, left there during hostilities,
to the country now redeemed by their arms. The history and
legal annals of Texas are filled with examples. (Yoakum's
History of Texas, vol. H, pp. 34, 36, 118, 125, 175, 181; Ordinances of Gen. Council, pp. 52, 55, 56, 58; Republic v.
Young, Dallam, 464; The State v. Skidmore, 5 Tex., 469;
Russell v. Randolph, 11 Tex., 464-'6.) It could not be intended
by the Constitution of the new State, then in need of citizens,
and anxious to attract them, to disfranchise such persons by a
rigorous and literal application of the term "resident." And
this conclusion is confirmed by the established meaning of this
term. (Lambe v. Smith, 15 Mees. and W., 434; Hrylton V.
Brown, 1 Wash. C. C. R., 314; Blanchard v. Stearns, 5 Met.,
803; Crawford v. Wilson, 4 Barb., 522.) It is true that in
some instances, especially in cases arising under attachment
laws, it has been said that residence and domicil were not always equivalent terms, and that a citizen domiciliated in one
State, might have a temporary residence in another. But
these decisions were based entirely upon the consideration of
the object and intention of the particular statutes which were
then to be interpreted, and do not deny that in other statutes,
having a more enlarged purpose, the two terms would be regarded as identical. Strictly speaking, the mere fact of inhabitancy does not constitute a domicil; the intention of
remaining must also exist; but it follows, from this very rule,
that a domicil implies and presupposes a residence, and that
one who had his domicil in the Republic of Texas, necessarily
resided there-legally, if not physically. The position here
assumed is strengthened by the fact, that at the time of the
declaration of independence of Texas, the western portion of
the new Republic was filled with the military forces and polit-

ical adherents of the invader. It would be the height of absurdity to suppose that the framers of the Constitution designed
to convert the troops and the supporters of Santa Anna, then
actually within Texas, and with a literal residence in the
country, into citizens of the revolutionary Government.
If, then, the Constitution of the Republic of Texas conferred
citizenship upon those who had their domicil in the countiy
at the time of the declaration of independence, it will follow
that Catherine MfcMasteis was a citizen: of the Republic. It
pp eared by the allegations of the plea that~the domicil of her
birth or origin was in Texas, at the town of Goliad, and that
domicil certainly continues until another is acquired. (Somerville v. Somerville, 5 Vesey, 787; Monro v. Monro, 7 Cl. and
Fin., 876;
Mascard de Prob. con ol. 85, No. 1.) To acquire
another domicil, an intention to abandon the domicil of origin
must exist. (Mdnro v. Monro, 7 Cl. and Fin., 891.) And an
al-sence of fifteen or twenty years is not in itself, without proof
of such intention, suificient to forfeit the original domicil.
(Merlin, Repert. Domicile, § 2; Dalloz, Diet. Gen. Domicile, §
1, Nos. 9-13.) In the case of Saint Germain, absent in India for
forty-five years, it was decided that such absence; without proof
of his intention to, abandon his residence in France, did not
divest himn'of his domicil. (Dalloz, Jur. Gen., vol. 6, pp. 383-'4.)
The intention or animus, thus essential 'to the acquisition of a
new domicil, must be a legal and disposing will, and the voluntaVy act of a mind capable in law of acting. It can only be
evinced by a person sui juris. (Somerville v. Somerville, 5
Ves., 787; Guier v. O'Daniel & Young, note to 1 Binn., 349,
852.) And, a fiortiori, an infant or child cannot be capable of
such an intention; _Piam infans, et qui infanti proximu&est, non
mulum afuioso distat.7 (Inst. IIT, 19, 10,.) A minor, without
parents or legal tutor, can, therefore never lose or abandon
propro marte the domicil of origin. (Story-Confl. Laws,. § 46,
06, note; 1 Burge Comm; Col. Law, 38, 39; Pothier, Cont.
4t'Orleans, Ch. 1, sec. 1, Nos. 12-18; ed. de Brugnet, vol. 1, p.
5; Desduitz de St. Pierre v. Revel, Sirey, 85, p. 2, 556.) '-And
this principle has been repeatedly recognised in *thedecisions
of the Supreme Court of Louisiana-a court the most conversant
with such questions. (Robbins v. Weeks,'5 Mart. N. S., 879;
Succession of M. J. Robert, 2 Rob.. La.-R., 435-'6.) It is true
that the surviving father or mother, that is to say, the natural
tutor, may change, at will, the domicil of the minor, and transfer it to a-different country; (Potinger v. Wightman, 3 Mer.,
67, 79;) but this power does not extend to a mere friend, or to
a person assuming, without the 'direct authority of law, the
custody, of the minor's person. (Robbins v. Weeks, 5 Mart.

12

SUPREME COURT.
Zones et al. v. Mctaiters.

N. S., 379.) These rules are well explained by J. Voet, in his
Commentaries on the Pandects, (Lib. V, tit. I, No. 100,) Where
he says, "Ut enim haud difflciliter admitlendum sit minorennem non
magis posse domicilium mutare quam contrahendo se obligare;
tamen quemadmodum contrahere auctore utore permissum ei est,
itaque et domicilium cum patre matreve, tanquam tutelao ejus aut
saltem educationi preposita,tutoribus cceteris non contradicentibus,
mutare nihil vetat." It is because the authority of the tutor
supplies the defect of legal capacity or volition in the minor,
that the latter acquires the domicil to which he accompanies
the guardian; but as the authority of the delegated or appointed tutor ceases when he removes beyond the limits of the
country, (Johnstone v. Beattie, 10 Cl. and Fin., 42, 87, 113, 148,)
only the natural guardian-the parent of the minor, whose
power remains unimpaired-can change the domicil of his
ward to a new country. (School Directors v. James,,2 Watts
and S., 568, 572.) These principles are substantially recognised
in the case of Hardy v. De Leon. (5 Tex., 234-'8.) Sylvester
De Leon resided in Texas at the date of the declaration of
independence; in 1838, he was removed by the military
authorities of the country to Louisiana, where his son, Fkrancisco Santiago De Leon, was born; the wife of Sylvester died;
the family then removed to Tamaulipas, and the children were
left in the care of their grandmother, while Sylvester returned
to Texas; after a short visit, he again went to Tamaulipas, with
the intention of returning to Texas with his children, but was
killed on the road. Francisco, his youngest son, however,
came to Texas, and lived at Goliad; and iri
a suit commenced
in his name, it was pleaded by the defendants that he was an
alien enemy. The Supreme Court of Texas held that the
plaintiff's father, Sylvester De Leon, had never lost his citizenship in Texas; and if he had, or if his citizenship did not attach
to his infant son, born in Louisiana, still the domicil of origin,
acquired by the birth of Francisco in Louisiana, could not be
forfeited by his removal, during minority, and without his own
volition, to Mexico.
The case made by the present plea in abatement is stronger
than that of Hardy v. De Leon. Catherine McMasters was
a child, less than five years of age, at the time of her removal
from the domicil of her parents and of her own birth, in
Texas, to a foreign country. Her parents were both dead;
she has had no recognised tutor, nor has she been emancipated
by marriage; she was removed by the family of M ianuel Sabriego, with which she has continued to reside; and it does
not appear that the family, which she thus acccompanied, had
any legal authority whatever to control her course in life, or

-decide on her domicil. It was incumb.ent on the plaintiff to
have repelled the legal presumption arising from these facts,
by a replication to the plea; and .the' demurrer should have
been overruled.
These views are confimd by a recent decision : of the
Supreme Court of Texas, made. at Tyler, in 1857, in the case
of Wheeler v.
"uois.p
(See manuscript opinion.- In -the
course of this decision, after refeiring to the doubt as to the
general authority of a guardian to change the domicil of his
ward, the court states its conclusion to be, that a. mother is
'not deprived, by her second marriage, of the natural right of
controlling the person of her child, and determining its future
home; but that this power. does not extend to the, mere legal
guardian, after the death of both parents, nor authorize the
mother, even 'as, natural guardian, -to change the domicil of
the child, td the'injury of its interests or the forfeiture, of its
property. "When an infant has no parents, the law, it is true,
remits him to his domicil of orin or to the. last.domicil of hi parents. But when he has a surviving mother, it is difficult to
perceive, the justice 'or propriety there would be in not permitting her to make her domicil -that of her children." "In
other communities, it. may not be unusual -for children, who
have parents' to have others appointed their guardians; and,
then it may be truly said that the ward is not naturally or ne-'
cessarily a part of theguatdian's family;" "and so it maybe said
where the ward has no parent." And the court cites the opinion
of Ch.J. Gibson in School-Directors v. James,-2 W. and S.7 568,
with approbation, and affirms the'rule, that "whatever may.
be the power of the guardian over the person -and projerty of
the ward, he cannot exercise it'so as to injure the ward himself.
The very end and purpose of his office is protectionj and'there is
no imaginable case in-which the lawinakes it an instrument of
injury by implication.". It is.
evident, from this decision; that
Sabriego had no.powertoremove the infant.plaintiff from the
domidil of origin for any reason, much less to make such removal when itwould work a forfeitureof the minor's lainds in Texas.
This' part of.the case, however, can be put upon higher
ground. The principles of the Spanish law, and not the
law of nations or of nature, controlled the political rights. ofpersons under both the Republics of Mexico and of Texas,
The jurisprudence of Spain in relation to questions of.citizenohp was strictly and perhaps too- exclusively national in its
spirit. It admitted of no divided allegiance; it suffiredno'
expatriation from the native soil. The domicil of the oFrgin
fixed the.political.rights and duties of the subjectand citizen
forever. "By law, no .one .canAenaturalize himnselt"

paragraph: "Originarius hujus 1?egni, qui in aliud se transtulit,

Lopez to Part. IV, 24-'5.) The political existence of Cathethe language
rine .KMasters was attached to the soil, and, in.
of Ciarlina above cited, she was mortgaged to it as her country. She might lose her rights of property by absence, or her
civil privileges by disuse; but the Republic of Texas could
not suffer her to sacrifice the political duties which wedded
her to the country of her birth-much less allow a self-appointed guardian to sever this infant, without power or freedom of choice, from her natural mother.
Mr. H1ughes:
1. This plea shows that plaintiff below did not reside in
Texas at the day of the declaration of independence, but was
then residing, in Matamoras, or elsewhere in Mexico. And
we would say that this settles the question, for a prima facie
case, to say the least, is made, showing that she was not a
citizen of the Republic.
The declaration of the Constitution of the Republic is, "All
persons (Africans excepted, &c.) who were residing in Texas
on the day of the declaration of independence, shall be considered citizens of the Republic, and entitled to all the privileges
of such."--Const. of Rep., Gen. Prov., sec. 10, Hart. Dig., p. 38.
But, to avoid the effect of this provision, it is contended that
the word "residing," in the connection it is found, should be
construed the game as "domicil ;" and to show that there might
be a domicil, without a continued actual residence, numerous

DECEIBER TERM, 1857.

authorities will no doubt be referred to-all of which, as before stated, will be admitted to be good law; but they do not
meet the case. For it is manifest that the Convention which
framed the Constitution did not intend to indicate "domicil"
by the language used; and the error, if error there be, in the
premises or conclusions of counsel, is in supposing that only
by virtue of the provision of the Constitution cited, was t
declared who were citizens of Texas and who werenot. We
suppose
the provision
inserted
was so inserted for the purpose
of providing
for a class
of persons
who, upon general princi-:

pies, might not~be citizens of the new Republic.

There were

and could not have been otherwise than great numbers'of
persons, within the limits of Texas, who had not become citizens, and all such it was intended to make citizens. This will
appear from an examination of the other provisions of-the
same 10th section and other Sections of the Constitution.
But, again, had the word "domicil" been used instead of
"residing," there would have. been something in the argu:ment. DIomicil does not necessarily. indicate residence, for
the authorities show, that though domicil may be accompanied
with residence, it is not always so; but theremay be domicil
without actual residence. Residence. does not always indicate domicil.
If it had been the intention to make a declaration which was
to' determine as to all persons who should be citizens of the
Republic, some other term would have been used; but the use
of the expression inserted shows that there might be other persons who were citizens, besides those provided for-those, for
instance, vho had been, and up to the day of the declaration of
independence continued to be, citizens of the State of Coahuila
and Texas, residing in Texas, but who might be temporarily
absent from the State, on business of the country, &c.
Transientpersons, however, were not provided for, as they
should not have been. The Mexican army in.the west spoken
of, who came to subjugate- Texas, being all transient,, could
not come within the language "residing."
This question will now be -viewed in its true character, not
as a mere question of domestic domicil- but in that more inportant, as a question, of national character.
The plea shows that Catherine Mefasters was, from the time
of her birth up to about the age of four years, domiciled in
Goliad, the place of her birth, but removed therefrom by those
under wh6se charge she was, to Matamoras, before the declaration of'indepehdence. She',then was a native Mexican,
owing allegiance to the Republic of Mexico. Whieh she was
removed, a revolution had commenced, and was subsequently

perfected by the declaration of independence. It'will not be
questioned, it is presumed, that after the close of the revolution, those who had participated in the struggle on either side,
by*reason of their adherence to Texas or to Mexico, were
either Mexicans or Texans, as they adhered to the one side
or the other. But how was it with others, who by no act of
adherence had made an election? It has been,contended for
plaintiff in error, that this was settled by the domicil of each
individual: if within Texas, then they were Texans; if in
Mexico, then they were Mexicans. And in this particular,
Catherine McMasters, being a minor, and incapable of will,
though removed beyond the limits of Texas before independence was ,declared, did not forfeit the domicil of her birth,
that of her parents, and was a Texan. When reasoning as
to domicil, this may all be well enough; but, as before intimated, wle are speaking of national character, under particular circumstances;- and this, in the circumstances in which
Catherine McMasters stood, depended on election. If she had
remained in Texas, she would have been regarded as a Texan
citizen. But having 'been removed to Mexico, she thereby
adhered to Mexico, though she had no will on the subject; but
being a minor, not having power to make an election, she had
time until-majority to make such election; and when made, she
would be a citizen of that State -towhich she adhered; but in
the mean time she could be considered in no other light than
a citizen of Mexico. These principles have been recognised
in this court, and applied to a case'occurring during our revolution.
A native-born American, resident in New York, united himself to the English forces in possession of New York, and adhered throughout the struggle to the British side, and went off
with the British forces, and died in the British dominions. His,
son, born in New York, was taken with him, and continued
under his charge. This son afterwards claimed an estate by
descent, and it was determined that he was an alien, and could
not take by descent; and in delivering the judgment of the
court, Mr. Justice Thompson says: "John Inglis; if born before the declaration of independence, muist hive been very
young at that time, and incapable of making an election for
himself; but he mustf-after such a lapse of time, be taken to
have adopted and ratifiedthe-choice made for him by his father, and still to retain the character of a British subject, and
never to have become an American citizen, if-his father was
to be so-considered. He was taken from this country by his
father before the treaty of peace, and has continued ever
since to reside within the British doiminions, without' signify-

.Tonu et al. v. Acrafaatiers.

ing any dissent to the election made for him; and this ratification as to all his rights must relate back, and hav6 the same
effect and operation as if the election had been made by him
at that time."
Again: "The British doctrine therefore is, that the American ante nati, by remaining in America after the treaty of peace,
lost their character ofBritish subjects, And our doctrine is,
that by withdrawing from the country and adhering to the
British Government, they lost, or perhaps, more properly speaking, never acquired,the character of American citizens."-Inglis
v.The Sailors' Snug Harbor, 3 Peters, 122-3.
And this is the case which sh6ws the distinction between
mere"questions of domestic domicil and the more important
questions as to niional character. In the former, the question'
of domicil of a minor is settled by that of his father, or the last
of the father, when he is dead; while in the latter, the national
character depends upon election, whetlier .the'party be adult
or minor, though the act of the father making his election may
operate an election for the son, if his dissent be not made in
due time.
But did Catherine McMasters either show a dissent or an
election to beepme-a Mexican, instead of a Texan? It will be
seen, by an examination of the plea in question, that she was
about four years of age when she was removed by Manuel
Sabriego to Matamoras, before the declaration of independence, in March, 1936; she was therefore of age eighteen years
afterwards, in the year 1853. We have no evidence of a dissent to the act of removal by Sabriego, or of an election to
become a citizen of Texas; -and upon the principles established
iu the case referred to in this court, it must be presumed that
she ratified the act of her "friend, and remained a citizen of
Mexico, and Was so by relation from the time of removal and
the declaration. But the plea'is contradictory in iegard to the
age of Catherine McMasters,:for after,the statement of her age
before the,'declaration of independence, it is' in another part
alleged that she was a minor at the time of filing said-plea in
1854. This matter of the age is material; and if th contradiction is to have effect at all, one averment destroys the.other, and
then there is no good pleafor the want of material averments.

county of Goliad, in the forks of the San Antonio river and
the Cabaza creek, containing four leagues of land. Four of
the defendants put in a plea of not guilty. At a subsequent
day, John R. Tally was allowed to come inand defend as landlord of Lott, one of the defendants. Whereupon, he put in a
plea to the jurisdiction of the court, upon the ground the
plaintiff was a citizen of the State of Texas. The plea states
that she was born at Goliad, then in the State of Coahuila and
Texas, when it was a part of the Republic of Mexico; that the
domicil of her father and mother were at this place at the time
of her birth, and continued there till their deaths. That the
plaintiff was removed from the Territory of Texas to Matamoras, west of the Rio Grande,in Mexico, when she was about
four years of age, during the revolutionary movements in
Texas, and before the declaration of indcpendence, which was
on the 2d March, 1836. That she was removed in the family
of M. Sabriego, in which she had lived in Texas, and with
whom she has continued to reside since in Mexico. There
was a demurrer to this plea, which was allowed, and the defendant required to answer over. The defendant then put in
a plea of not guilty, and also a special plea in bar of alienage,
and limitation of nine years before suit brought, founded upon
a statute of the State of Texas.
There was a demurrer *to this plea, but undisposed of for
aught-that appears on the record, when the parties went down
to the trial of the issues of fact.
On the trial, the plaintiff proved a title in due form, under
date of the 16th July, 1833, to the land in controversy, in her
grandmother, Maria de Jesus Ybarba Trejo, followed by the
official survey and judicial possession; also, that her grandmother died in possession of the premises, leaving the plaintiff's
mother, her only child, at the death of her mother and father.
Her grandmother and mother died about the year 1834. Her
father was killed in the same year.
The defendants claimed- under patents from the State of
Texas, one dated 15th September, 1849, for three hundred and
twenty acres; the other, the 20th of February, 1847, for like
number; which covered the possessions on the tract in dispute
of two of the defendants.
When the evidence closed, the counsel for the defendants
prayed the court to charge the jury, that if the plaintiff, as a
Mexican citizen, had continued to reside out of Texas from a
period before the declaration of Texan independence, the action
could not be sustained; which was refused, and a charge given,
that her right remained as it was before the revolution, both
according to general principles and by force of the treaty of

Guadalupe Hidalgo; and that if she had a right of property,
that gave her the right to sue here.
The counsel also prayed the court to charge, that if the jury
should believe, from the evidence, that the survey and grant
under which the plaintiff claims title extends so as to include
a large area out of the limits prescribed by law, as dated in the
decree No. 190, of the laws of Coahuila and Texas, and that
the error did not arise from mistake of quantity, but from intention to depart from the legal mode of survey, then the jury
might consider the grant void as to such area as might be out
of the limits prescribed by law, and also that the grant itself
would be void in such cases for want of legal survey. Which
prayer was refused.
The counsel also requested the court to charge, that if the
jury should believe, from -the evidence, that ,the survey and
grant under which the plaintiff claimed extended so as to include a large area-as aforesaid, and 'that the grant and survey
were so made by fraudulent procurement on the part of the
grantee, by an agent in that behalf, then the jury might con,,
sider the grant as entirely'void.
The court so instructed the jury; but with the addition, that
unless the alcalde commissioner was informed, at the time he
gave possession and issued the title, of the fact that-the survey
had been extended so as to include a large area, &c., the grant
would not, be void; that the fraudulent procurement of the
-survey alone would not vitiate the grant.
-The counsel also requested the court to charge, that the grant
.under which the plaintiff claimed is one of the class that might
be forfeited for non-performance of conditions. That ordinarily a law of the Legislature, and judicial action under it, would
be necessary to avoid such a grant. Yet that claimant might
act so as to supersede the necessity of such a judicial determination; and if conduct of plaintiff amounted to an admission
of the forfeiture, she could not afterwards et up the right,
especially against a person who had, in the mean time, acquired.
a grant from the State; and that it was a question for the jury
to determine, whether the conduct of the plaintiff amounted to
an admission of forfeiture., -

-

The court gave the instruction, with the addition, that it
was a question as to the actual intention of the plaintiff; and
the jury shbuld be satisfied, considering the infancy and all
other circumstances, that such was in fact her intention, or
they should find for the plaintiff.
The jury: found a verdict for the plaintiff.
As the practice in the court below permits pleas of-whatever
nature or description to be put in as a defence to the suit at

the same time, and without regard to the order of pleas, as
known to the system of the common law, it will be necessary in
the first place to examine the question raised on the demurrer
to the plea to the jurisdiction. It is insisted that the plaintiff
is a citizen of the State of Texas, according to the facts as stated
in the plea and admitted by the demurrer; and if so, as she is
not a citizen and resident of a different State, but a resident of
Texas, the suit cannot be maintained within the 11th section
of the judiciary act. We think the objection not well founded.
The plaintiff was born under the dominion of the Mexican
Republic, and has lived under it ever since her birth, and beyond all question, therefore, is a citizen of that Government,
owing it allegiance, which has never been interrupted or
changed. There has been no act of hers, or of any one competent to"represent her, or to determine her election, indicating
an intention to throw off this allegiance, and to attach herself to
the new sovereignty of Texas. Having been born and having
always lived under the old Government, the burden rested upon
the defendants, who claimed that she was a citiien of the new
one, to establish the fact of the chaage of her allegiance. (2
Cranch, 280; 4 ib., 209; 1 Dallas, 53; 20 Johns. R., 313; 3
Peters R., 99, 122, 123; 2 Kent C., 40, 41.) The facts set up
in the plea prove the contrary. According to these, the plaintiff was nineteen years old when this suit was commenced, and
between ,twenty-two and twenty-three years when the .plea was
put in to the jurisdiction. If she was competent to make an
election while a minor, but after she had arrived at mature
years, as to the Government .to which she would owe allegiance, the presumption, upon othe facts, is, that she has
made it in favor of the one under which she has lived, since
her birth. If she was incompetent to make it during her
minority, then the allegiance due at her birth continued, and
existed at the time of the commencement of the suit.
We do not enter upon the question of the domicil of a minor
discussed on the argument, nor express any opinion upon it,
as the question here is one of national character, and does not
stand upon the mere doctrines of municipal law, but upon the
more general principles of the law of nations. (3 Peters, 242;
2 J. Cas., 29.)
Assuming that the plaintiff is an alien, and not a citizen of
Texas, the next question is, whether or not she is under any
disability that would prevent her from the assertion of her title
to the premises in question; in other words, whether her absence
and alienage worked a forfeiture of the estate. Thegeneial principle is undisputed, that the division of an empire works no forfiture of a right of property preiously acquired. Kelly v. Ham-

son. (2J. Cases, 29; 7 Pet., 87.) And, consequently, theplaintiff's right still exists in fall effect, unless the new sovereignty
created, within which the lands are situate, have taken some
ste p to abrogate it. The title remains after the revolution,
and erection of the new Government, the same as before. The
10th section of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas,
adopted the 17th March, 1836, provided that "no alien shall
hold land in Texas, except by title emanating directlyfrom the Government of this .Republic."
By the 20th section of the 7th article of the present Constitution of the State, it is provided "that the rights of property
and of action which have been acquired under the Constitution
and laws of the Republic of Texas shall not be divested; nor
shall any rights or actions which have been divested, barred,
or declared null and void, by the Constitution and laws of the
Republic of Texas, be reinvested or reinstated by this Constitution; but the same shall remain precisely in the situation
which they were before the adoption of this Constitution."
And by the 4th section of the 13th article, it is provided "that
all fines, penalties, forfeitures, and escheato, which have accrued
to the Republic of Texas under the Constitution and laws, shall
accrue to the. State of Texas; and the Legislature shall, by
law, provide a inethod for determining what lands may have
been forfeited or'escheated."
It is understood that the Legislature of Texas has not yet
passed any law providing for the steps to be taken to give effect
to e cheats for .alienage, or otherwise; at least, no such laWv
has been referred to, or relied on, in the argument; and the
course of decision in the courts of Texas appears to be, that,
until some act of the Legislature is passed on the subject, effect
cannot be given to the plea of alienage, or, at least, that some
proceeding must be had, on the part of the Government, divesting the estate for this cause, before effect can be given to
it. 15 Texas R.,,495.
The defence of alienage, therefore, was properly overruled
by the court below.
The counsel for the defendants insist that the estate of the
plaintiff became forfeited under the Mexican lhws, by her removal from the State of Coahuila and Texas to Matamoras,
while under the Mexican Government, and a permanent residence taken up there.
But the removal that worked a forfeiture under Mexican
colonization laws, and divestiture of the title'without judiciai
inquiry, was a removal out of the Republic of Mexico, and settlement in a foreign country. The principle has no.application
in this case. 18 How., 235, (MeKenn y v. Sarvego.)

SUPREME COURT.
Bacon et al. v. Howard.

The remaining questions in the case relate to those arising
upon the survey and location of the premises in question. This
survey and location were made by the Government surveyor,
under -the direction of the alcalde and land commissioner of
the municipality, who was deputed by the Governor to cause
the land to be surveyed, and to convey the title in due form.
The counsel for the defendants claimed the right to inquire
into the regularity of this survey and location, and also into
the bonafides of the transaction.
It must be remembered that this is a suit at law to recover
the possession of the land in dispute; and that, although it
may be the course of practice in the courts of the State of Texas,
in a suit of-this description, to blend in the proceeding the
principles of law and equity, in the Federal courts sitting in
the State, the two systems must be kept distinct and separate.
This principle is fundamental in these courts, and cannot be
departed from. The court, therefore, in a suit at law, should
exclude the hearing and determination of all questions that belong appropriately and exclusively to the jurisdiction of a court
of equity. In a case calling for the interposition of this court,
uzan turning upon equitable considerations, relief should be
sought by bill in equity. Many of the cases at law coming
up from the District Court of this State are greatly complicated
and embarrassed, from the want of the observance of this distinction in the proceedings before it. In respect to the survey
and location in the case before us, we perceive no ground that
could warrant the court in going behind them in a suit at law.
They were made by the Government that granted the title, and
there is no ground, or even pretence, for saying that they were
made without authority; and hence, altogether void. If voidable, for' irregularity or other cause, the question was not one
for a court of law in ar action to recover possession, but for a
court of equity to reform any error or mistake. :(9 Peters, 632;
13 ib., 368-'9; 3 Wh., 212, 221; 7 How., 844.) We think a
satisfactory answer might be given to the several objections
taken to the survey and location; but we prefer to place it
upon the ground above stated.
The judgment of the court below affirmed.
JOHN BACON, ALEXANDER SYMINGTON, AND THOMAS ROBINS,
COMPLAINANTS AND APPELLANTS, V. VOLNEY E. HOWARD.
By the laws of the Republic of Texas, no action would lie on a foreign judgment,
and all actions of debt were prescribed in four years.
When about to foriii a Constitution, for the purpose of becoming a State of the
Union, the Legislature passed a-law permitting suits to be brought on foreign
judgments, but limiting them to sixty days when the judgment was of four years
standing and upward.
