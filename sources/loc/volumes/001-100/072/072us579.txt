JONES v. LA VALLETTE.

579

Opinion of the court.

JONES v. LA VALLETTE.
A judgment in the Circuit Court of Louisiana in the ordinary action by pe,
tition and summons upon a promissory note cannot be brought into this
court by appeal.

It must come here, if at all, on writ of error.

A JUDGMENT had been rendered in the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana, in
favor of La Vallette against Jones, in the ordinary action
by petition and summons, upon a promissory note. The
defendants below took an appeal, seeking to bring the case
into this court in that way.
Mr. ,Janin now moved to dismiss the appeal, contending
that appeal was not the proper form of bringing up the case.
Mr. Durant, contra.
The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the court.
The Judiciary Act of 1789 gave appellate jurisdiction to
this court by writ of error, and it was held that under that
act no cause could be brought here by appeal.*
The act of 1803 gave appellate jurisdiction by appeal
"from final judgments and decrees in cases of equity, of
admiralty, and maritime jurisdiction, and of prize or no
prize." No other cases can be brought here in this mode,
and the case in the record is of neither class. It must come
here, if at a]l, upon writ of error.
The appeal must therefore be
DISMISSED FOI

WANT OF JURISDICTION.
