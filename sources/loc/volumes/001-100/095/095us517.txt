3. It was an unalterable condition of the admission of Wisconsin into the Union,
that, of the public lands in the State, section 16 in every township, which
had not been sold or otherwise disposed of, should be granted to her for the
use of schools.
2. Whether the compact with the State constituted only a pledge of a grant in
faturo, or operated to transfer to her the sections as soon as they could be
identified by the public surveys, the lands embraced within them were set
apart from the public domain, and could not be subsequently diverted from
their appropriation to the State. If any further assurance of title was required, the United States was bound to provide for the execution of proper
instruments transferring to the State the naked fee, or to adopt such other
legislation as would secure that result.
3. The right of the Menomonee Indians to their lands in Wisconsin was only that
of occupancy; and, subject to that right, the State was entitled to every section 16 within the limits of those lands.

to sections 16.

This was replevin by Beecher to recover from Wetherby,
James, and Stille, saw-logs, cut and taken by'them during the
winter of 1872 and 1873, from section 16, township 28, range 1

patents from the United States bearing date Oct. 10, 1872; and
the defendants, under patents from that State of Dec. 15, 1865,
and Sept. 26, 1870.
Under the eighth article of the treaty of Aug. 19, 1825,
7 Stat. 272, the Menomonee lands were declared to be "bounded
on the north by the Chippewa country, on the East by Green
Bay and Lake Michigan, extending as far south as Milwaukee
River, and on the West they claim to Black River." The
lands in question are embraced i. this tract.

[Sup. ot.

A treaty concluded with the Menomonees Feb. 8, 1831,
id. 342, confirming those boundaries, was ratified by the Senate,
with a proviso that two townships on the east side of Winnebago Lake should be ceded for the use of the Stockbridge and
Munsee Indians.
By a treaty concluded Oct. 18,1848, and ratified Jan. 23,1849,
9 id. 952, the Menomonees agreed to cede to the United States
all their lands in Wisconsin. The eighth article stipulated that
they should be permitted to remain on the ceded lands for the
period of two years, and until the President should notify them
that the same were wanted.
The act to enable the people of Wisconsin Territory to form
a Constitution and State government, and for the admission of
such State into the Union, approved Aug. 6, 1846, id. 56, provides "that section numbered 16 in every township of the public lands in said State, and, when such section has been sold
or otherwise disposed of, other lands equivalent thereto, and as
contiguous as may be, shall be granted to said State for the use
of schools."
The convention called to form a constitution, on the first
day of February, 1849, accepted the proposition contained in
the organic .act. Rev. Stat. Wis. 1849, p. 45. By an act
entitled "An Act for the admission of the State of Wisconsin
into the Union," approved May 29, 1848, id. 233, such acceptance was assented to by Congress.
A joint resolution of the legislature of Wisconsin, approved
Feb. 1, 1853, Gen. Laws of Wis. 1853, p. 110, gives the assent
of that State "to the Menomonee nation of Indians to remain
on the tract of land set apart for them by the President of the
United States, on the Wolf and Oconto Rivers, and upon which
they now reside, the same being within the State of Wisconsin
aforesaid, and described as follows, to wit: Commencing at the
south-east corner of town 28 north, range 19, running thence
west thirty miles, thence north eighteen miles, thence east
thirty miles, thence south eighteen miles to the place of beginning."
On the 12th of May, 1854, 10 Stat. 1064, a treaty was made
with the Menomonees, "supplementary and amendatory" to that
ratified Jan. 23, 1849, wherein it is recited that, "upon mani-

festation of great unwillingness on the part of said Indians to
remove to the country west of the Mississippi River, &c., which
had been assigned to them, and a desire to remain in the State
of Wisconsin, the President consented to their locating temporarily upon the Wolf and Oconto Rivers;" and, "to render
practicable the stipulated payments therein recited, and to make
exchange of the lands given west of the Mississippi for those
desired by the tribe, and for the purpose of giving them the
same for a permanent home, these articles are entered into."
By the second article of said treaty, the following-described
tract lying on Wolf River in the State of Wisconsin was ceded
to the Indians to be held as Indian lands are held: "Commencing at the south-east corner of town 28 N., R. 16 E.,
4th principal meridian, running west twenty-four miles, thence
north eighteen miles, thence east twenty-four miles, thence south
eighteen miles to the place of beginning, the same being townships 28, 29, and 30 of ranges 13, 14, 15, and 16, according to
public survey."
Under an act of Congress approved Feb. 6, 1871, 16 Stat.
404, entitled "An Act for the relief of the Stockbridge and
MHunsee tribe of Indians in the State of Wisconsin," the two
townships set apart for their use, including the section upon
which the logs were cut, and forming a part of the Menomonee
lands, were sold by the United States, and the plaintiff deraigns
title under its patents.
The exterior lines of the township in which the land in question is situate were run in October, 1852, and the section lines
in May and June, 1854.
There was a judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff then
brought the case here.
Hr. Chlarles TF -elker for the plaintiff in error.
The act was in the nature of an executory agreement, and
by its terms no title to sections numbered 16 could vest in the
State until they were surveyed and designated on the plats filed
in the surveyor-general's office. The sectional or subdividing
lines of the township in question were not run prior to the
treaty of May 12, 1854. The proviso to the act implies a reserved power in the government to sell or dispose of sections 16
while they remained a part of the public domain, and that

BEECHER v. WETHERBY.

[Sup. Ct

treaty did not reserve any section, but appropriated the entire tract as a reservation, and vested the title thereto in the
Indians. l2eade v. United States, 2 Ct. of Cl. 224; United
States v. Brooks, 10 How. 442. The State took title to none
but public land. Land like that in question, continuously and
rightfully in the occupation of an Indian tribe under authority
of the government, is not "public" within the meaning of the
grant. Mr. Justice Davis, in Newhall v. Sanger, 92 U. S. 761,
justly remarked, that the words "public lands" "are habitually
used in our legislation to describe such as are subject to sale
or other disposal under general laws." The treaty ratified
Jan. 23, 1849, allowed the Indians to remain upon the lands
for two years, and until the President should give notice that
they were wanted. His subsequent act setting them apart as
a reservation was a specific appropriation of them. Not having
then been surveyed, no right of the State to sections 16 within
the reservation vested, and they have never since become
"public lands." Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498; Cooper v.
Roberts, 18 How. 173; Leavenworth, &c. Railroad Co. v.
United States, 92 U. S. 733; Spaulding et al. v. Martin,
11 Wis. 262.
The cession to the United States of two townships in the
reservation does not affect the principle contended for: they
were in fact ceded for a reservation for the Stockbridge and
Munsee Indians, and did not become a part of the public lands.
Neither is it material that they were, by the act of Feb. 6, 1871,
directed to be sold for the benefit of those Indians. The relation of the .United States to the property is the same. 16 Stat.
404; Leavenworth, &c. Railroad Co. v. United States, supra.
Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, is not in conflict with these
views. There the lands had not been legally appropriated by
the government before the title of the State vested.
The position that the title did not vest in the State until
the lands were surveyed and the townships subdivided is not
affected by the fact that the subdivision was made in June,
1854, before the treaty of May 12 was ratified by the Senate
Aug. 2 of that year. The rights of no innocent third parties
intervening, the treaty took effect by relation from the day of
its date. United States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691.

It cannot be claimed that the defendants are innocent purchasers. The patents under which they claim were issued, the
one over eleven, and the other over sixteen years, after that
treaty was made, and they bought with knowledge of it.
If it should be held, however, that the survey was made
before that treaty was concluded, the eighth article of the
treaty of Oct. 18, 1848, and the acts of the President subsequent thereto, were a legal impediment to the vesting of any
title in the State.
But if the State ever had any interest, contingent or otherwise, in section 16 in each township of this Indian reservation,
such interest was waived by the resolution of the legislature
of Feb. 1, 1853. An estoppel is available against the State.

At the time of the survey in October, 1852, and the subdivision in May and June, 1854, no legal impediment existed
to the complete investiture of'the title of the State. Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold and Silver 1lining Co., supra.
The fee to the land was in the United States, subject, in
respect to a part, to the right of occupancy by the Menomonees
when Congress passed the enabling act of 1846. It was the
obvious intention that the grant should be executed from time
to time, as that right was extinguished and the surveys designated the sections.
From the origin of the government it had been settled that
the United States might make a valid grant of lands to which
the Indian right had not been extinguished, and that such a
grant passed the title subject to that right. Fletcher v. Peck,

The argument of the plaintiff, that the joint resolution of
1853 operated as a grant of the sixteenth section, is based
upon the assumed fact that the title was then in the, State.
Even if this were correct, the joint resolution is for the following, among other, reasons unconstitutional and void: First, because in Wisconsin such a resolution is simply an expression
of opinion binding on no one, and without the force of law.
Const. of Wis., art. 4, sect. 1; Cooley, Const. Lim. 130, 131.
Second, because it does not contain the enacting clause required
by the Constitution of the State, and is not a bill. Const. of
Wis., art. 4, sect. 17; Rev. Stat. Wis. 1858, p. 30.
MR. JUSTIOE FnELD delivered the opinion of the court.
This was an action of replevin brought by the plaintiff to recover two million feet of pine saw-logs of the estimated value
of $25,000, alleged to be his property, and to have been wrongfully detained from him by the defendants. The complaint
was in the usual form in such cases, and the answer consisted
of a general denial of its averments. The logs were cut by the
defendants from the tract of land in Wisconsin which constitutes section sixteen (16), in township twenty-eight (28), range
fourteen (14), in the county of Shawano, in that State. The
plaintiff claimed to be the owner of the logs by virtue of sundry patents of the land from which they were cut, issued to
him by the United States in October, 1872. The defendants
asserted property in the logs under patents of the land issued
to them by the State of Wisconsin in 1870. The question for
determination, therefore, is, which of these two classes of pat
ents, those of the United States or those of the State, transferred the title. The logs were cut in the winter of 1872 and
1873; they were, therefore, standing timber on the land when
all the patents were issued, and as such constituted a portion
of the realty., Although when severed from the soil the timber became personalty, the title to it remained unaffected.
The owner of the land could equally, as before, claim its
possession, and pursue it wherever it was carried.
The State asserted title to the land under the compact upon

Oct. 1877.]

BEECHER V. WETHERBY.

which she was admitted into the Union. The act of Congress
of Aug. 6, 1846, authorizing the people of the Territory of
Wisconsin to organize a State government, contained various
propositions respecting grants of land to the new State, to be
submitted for acceptance or rejection to the convention which
was to assemble for the purpose of framing its constitution.
Some of the proposed grants were to be for the use of schools,
some for the establishment and support of a university,
some for the erection of public buildings, and some were to be
of lands containing salt springs. They were promised on condition that the convention should provide by a clause in the
Constitution, or by an ordinance irrevocable without the consent of the United States, that the State would never interfere
with the primary disposal of the soil within it by the United
States, nor with any regulations Congress might find necessary
for securing the title in such soil to bona fide purchasers; that
no tax should be imposed on lands the property of the United
States; and that in no case should non-resident proprietors be
taxed higher than residents. And the act provided that if
the propositions were accepted by the convention, and ratified
by an article in the Constitution, they should be obligatory on
the United States. The first of these propositions was "that
section numbered sixteen (16) in every township of the public
lands in said State, and where such section has been sold or
otherwise disposed of, other lands equivalent thereto, and as
contiguous as may be, shall be granted to said State for the use
of schools."
The convention which subsequently assembled accepted the
propositions, and ratified them by an article in the Constitution,
embodying therein the provisions required by the act of Congress as a condition of the grants. With that Constitution the
State was admitted into the Union in May, 1848. 9 Stat. 283.
It was, therefore, an unalterable condition of the admission,
obligatory upon the United States, that section sixteen (16) in
every township of the public lands in the State, which had not
been sold or otherwise disposed of, should be granted to the
State for the use of schools. It matters not whether the words
of the compact be considered as merely promissory on the part
of the United States, and constituting only a pledge of a grant

BEECHER V. WETHERBY.

[Sup. ot.

in future, or as operating to transfer the title to the State
upon her acceptance of the propositions as soon as the sections
could be afterwards identified by the public surveys. In
either case, the lands which might be embraced within those
sections were appropriated to the State. They were withdrawn from any other disposition, and set apart from the public domain, so that no subsequent law authorizing a sale of it
could be construed to embrace them, although they were not
specially excepted. All that afterwards remained for the
United States to do with respect to them, and all that could be
legally done under the compact, was to identify the sections
by appropriate surveys; or, if any further assurance of title was
required, to provide for the execution of proper instruments to
transfer the naked fee, or to adopt such further legislation as
would accomplish that result. They could not be diverted
from their appropriation to the State.
In Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 178, this court gave construction to a similar clause in the compact upon which the State of
Michigan was admitted into the Union, and held, after full consideration, that by it the State acquired such an interest in every
section 16 that her title became perfect so soon as the section
in any township was designated by the survey. " We agree,"
said the court, "that, until the survey of the township and the
designation of the specific section, the right of the State rests
in compact, - binding, it is true, the public faith, and dependent for execution upon the political authorities. Courts of
justice have no authority to mark out and define the land
which shall be subject to the grant. But, when the political
authorities have performed this duty, the compact has an object
upon which it can attach, and, if there is no legal impediment,
the title of the State becomes a legal title. The jus ad rem, by
the performance of that executive act, becomes ajus in re, judicial in its nature, and under the cognizance and protection of
the judicial authorities, as well as the others." In this case, the
township embracing the land in question was surveyed in October, 1852, and was subdivided into sections in May and June,
1854. With this identification of the section the title of the
State, upon the authority cited, became complete, unless there
had been a sale or other disposition of the property by the

Oct. 1877.]

BEECHER V. WETHEPBY.

United States previous to the compact with the State. No
subsequent sale or other disposition, as already stated, could
defeat the appropriation. The plaintiff contends that there
had been a prior reservation of the land to the use of the
Menomonee tribe of Indians.
It is true that, for many years before Wisconsin became a
State, that tribe occupied various portions of her territory, and
roamed over nearly the whole of it. In 1825, the United
States undertook to settle by treaty the boundaries of lands
claimed by different tribes of Indians, as between themselves,
and agreed to recognize the boundaries thus established, the
tribes acknowledging the general controlling power of the
United States, and disclaiming all dependence upon and connection with any other power. The land thus recognized as
belonging to the Menomonee tribe embraced the section in
controversy in this case. Subsequently, in 1831, the same
boundaries were again recognized. But the right which the
Indians held was only that of occupancy. The fee was in the
United States, subject to that right, and could be transferred
by them whenever they chose. The grantee, it is true, would
take only the naked fee, and could not disturb the occupancy
of the Indians: that occupancy could only be interfered with
or determined by the United States. It is to be presumed
that in this matter the United States would be governed by
such considerations of justice as would control a Christian people in their treatment of an ignorant and dependent race. Be
that as it may, the propriety or justice of their action towards
the Indians with respect to their lands is a question of governmental policy, and is not a matter open to discussion in a controversy between third parties, neither of whom derives title
from the Indians. The right of the United States to dispose
of the fee of lands occupied by them has always been recognized
by this court from the foundation of the government. It was
so ruled in Johnson v. HIcntosh, 8 Wheat. 543, in 1823 ; and
in United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591, in 1873. Other cases
between those periods have affirmed the same doctrine. Clark
v. Smnith, 13 Pet. 195. See also Jackson v. Hudson, 3 Johns.
(N. Y.) 375; 'Feederet al. v. Guppy, 3 Wis. 502; and 8 Opin.
Atty.-Gen., pp. 262-264. In United Slates v. Cook, the United

BEECHER v. WETHERBY.

[Sup. Ct.

States maintained replevin for timber cut and sold by Indians on land reserved to 'them, the court observing that the
fee was in the United States, and only a right of occupancy
in the Indians; that this was the title by which other Indians
held their land, and that the authority of Johnson v. McIntosh
on this point had never been doubted. But, added the court,
"the right of the Indians to their occupancy is as sacred as
that of the United States to the fee, but it is only a right of
occupancy. The possession, when abandoned by the Indians,
attaches itself to the fee without further grant."
In the construction of grants supposed to embrace lands in the
occupation of Indians, questions have arisen whether Congress
intended to transfer the fee, or otherwise; but the power of
the United States to make such transfer has in no instance
been denied. In the present case, there can hardly be a doubt
that Congress intended to vest in the State the fee to section 16
in every township, subject, it is true, as in all other cases of
grants of public lands, to the existing occupancy of the Indians
so long as that occupancy should continue. The greater part
of the State was, at the date of the compact, occupied by
different tribes, and the grant of sections in other portions
would have been comparatively of little value. Congress undoubtedly expected that at no distant day the State would be
settled by white people, and the semi-barbarous condition of
the Indian tribes would give place to the higher civilization of
our race; and it contemplated by its benefactions to carry out
in that State, as in other States, "its ancient and honored
policy" of devoting the central section in every township for
the education of the people. Accordingly, soon after the admission of the State into the Union, means were taken for the
extinguishment of the Indian title. In less than eight months
afterwards the principal tribe, the MIenomonees, by treaty,
ceded to the United States all their lands in Wisconsin, though
permitted to remain on them for the period of two years, and
until the President should give notice that they were wanted
9 Stat. 952.
It is true that subsequently, the Indians being unwilling to
leave the State, the President permitted their temporary occupation of lands upon Wolf and Oconto Rivers, and in 1853 the

Oct. 1877.]

UNITED STATES

v. THE "GRACE LOTHROP."

State gave its assent to the occupation; and in -May, 1854, the
United States, by treaty, ceded to them certain lands for a permanent home, the treaty taking effect upon its ratification in
August of that year; and afterwards a portion of these lands
was, by another treaty, ceded to the Stockbridge and Munsee
tribes. But when the logs in suit were cut, those tribes had
removed from the land in controversy, and other sections had
been set apart for their occupation.
The act of Congress of Feb. 6, 1871, authorizing a sale of
the townships occupied by the Stockbridge and Munsee tribes,
must, therefore, be held to apply only to those portions which
were outside of sections 16. It will not be supposed that
Congress intended to authorize a sale of land which it had
previously disposed of. The appropriation of the sections to
the State, as already stated, set them apart from the mass
of public property which could be subjected to sale by its
direction.
It follows that the plaintiff acquired no title by his patents
to the land in question, and, of course, no property in the timber cut from it.
Judgment affirmed.
