COUNTY OF CASS V. JOH-NSTON.

1. The provisions of the act of the General Assembly of Missouri, entitled "An
Act to facilitate the construction of railroads in the State of Missouri," approved March 23, 1868, commonly known as the " Township Aid Act,"
which authorize a subscription to the capital stock of railway companies by
a township, whenever it appears, by the returns of an election duly called
for that purpose, "that not less than two-thirds of the qualified voters of the
township voting at such election are in favor of such subscription," are not
repugnant to sect. 14, art. 11, of the Constitution of that State, adopted in
1865, which ordains that the General Assembly shall not authorize any
county, city, or town to become a stockholder in, or to loan its credit to,
any company, association, or corporation, unless two-thirds of the qualified
voters of such county, city, or town, at a regular or special election to be held
therein, shall assent thereto.
2. Harshman v. Bates County, 92 U. S. 569, so far as it conflicts herewith, is overruled.
8. All qualified voters who absent themselves from an election held on pub
lic notice duly given are presumed to assent to the expressed will of the
majority of those voting, unless the law providing for the election otherwise declares.
4. It is not an objection to the validity of the bonds issued under that act that
the railroad company, to the capital stock of which the subscription was
made by the county court on behalf of the township, was not incorporated
until the day when the election took place.
6. On the bonds in question in this suit the judgment was properly rendered by
the court below against the county, to be enforced, if necessary, by manda7nus against the county court or the judges thereof, to compel the levy and
collection of a tax in accordance with the provisions of that act.

Western District of Missouri.
Johnston, a citizen of Iowa, brought th;s action Sept. 3, 1874,

of certain overdue coupons attached to bonds whereof he alleged that he was the lawful holder. A copy of one of the

The act referred to in the bond is generally known as "The
Township Aid Act." The first, second, third, and fifth sections
are as follows: "SECTION

1. Whenever twenty-five persons, tax-payers and resi-

dents, in any municipal township, for election purposes, in any
county in this State, shall petition the county court of such county,
setting forth their desire, as a township, to subscribe to the capital

[Sup. Ct.

stock of any railroad company in this State, building or proposing
to build a railroad into, through, or near such township, and stating
the amount of such subscription, and the terms and conditions on
which they desire such subscription 8hall be made, it shall be the
duty of the county court, as soon as may be thereafter, to order an
election to be held in such township, to determine if such subscription shall be made; which election shall be conducted and returns
made in accordance with the law controlling general and special
elections; and if it shall appear, from the returns of such election,
that not less than two-thirds of the qualified voters of such township voting at such election are in favor of such subscription, it
shall be the duty of the county court to make such subscription in
behalf of such township, according to the terms and conditions
thereof, and if such conditions provide for the issue of bonds in payment of such subscription, the county court shall issue such bonds,
in the name of the county, with coupons for interest attached, but
the rate of interest shall not exceed ten per cent per annum; and
the same shall be delivered to the railroad company.
" SECT. 2. In order to meet the payments on account of the subscription to the stock, according to its terms, or to pay the interest
and principal on any bond which may be issued on account of such
subscription, the county court shall, from time to time, levy hnd
cause to be collected, in the same manner as county taxes, a special
tax, which shall be levied on all the real estate lying within the
township making the subscription, in accordance with the valuation
then last made by the county assessor for county purposes.
"SECT. 3. The county treasurer shall be authorized and required
to receive and collect, of the sheriff of the county, the income from
the tax provided in the previous section, and to apply the same
to the payment of the stock subscription according to its terms, or to
the payments of interest and principal on the bonds, should any be
issued in payment of such subscription; he shall pay all interest on
such bonds, out of any money in the treasury collected for this purpose, by the tax so levied, as the same becomes due, and also the
bonds as they mature, which shall be cancelled by the county court;
and this service shall be considered a part of his duty as county

treasurer."
"SECT. 5. In all cases hereafter, where a railroad or branch rail-oad in this State shall be built, in whole or in part, by subscriptions
4o its stock, by counties, cities, or townships, the proceeds of all
State and county taxes, levied upon such railroad company or branch
so built, or the property thereof, shall be paid into the treasury of

counties, cities, or townships so subscribing stock, until the whole
amount of such subscription is refunded to them; and such sums
so app ortioned shall be paid over to the county or city treasurer,
and applied to the payment of the interest and principal of the
bonds issued by such county or city on account of their subscription
stock as aforesaid, if any are outstanding, and, if not, it shall by them
be placed to the credit of the school fund in such county, city, or
township2'
The remaining sections do not affect any question here
involved. They declare when the act shall take effect, and
provide for granting to tax-payers certificates convertible into
railway stock.
The Constitution of Missouri took effect July 4, 1865; and
sect. 14, art. 11, is as follows: "The General Assembly shall not authorize any county, city, or
town to become a stockholder in, or to loan its credit to, any company, association, or corporation, unless two-thirds of the qualified
voters of such county, city, or town, at a regular or special election,
to be held therein, shall assent thereto."
In 1871, the legislature of Missouri so amended sect. 2 of the
Township Aid Act of 1868 as to make the tax therein provided
for a tax upon all the real estate and personal property within
the township. The county answered, that said bonds were issued
in payment of a pretended subscription by said county in behalf
of said Camp Branch Township, to the St. Louis and Santa F4
Raih'oad Company, under the authority of the act of March 23,
1868, and that prior to the date of them the township had no
authority to subscribe for stock in said company or issue bonds
therefor, or to have the same done for it by the county court;
that prior to April 20, 1869, said company had not been organized, that on March 13, 1869, twenty-five voters of said township filed a petition, setting forth the desire of said township to
subscribe dollars to the capital stock of the St. Louis and
Santa F4 Railroad Company, proposed to be organized, to build
a railroad through said township, said subscription to be paid
in bonds to be issued by said county court for and on account
of the township; that on that day the co'urt ordered an election

[Sup. Ct.

in said township to be held on April 20, 1869; that on April
20, 1869, articles of incorporation were filed in the office of the
secretary of state as provided by law, and thereby said company in said State became. incorporated ; that at the election
so held two-thirds of the qualified voters of the township did
not vote in favor of the subscription, although more than twothirds of them voted at such election; and that by reason of
the premises said bonds were null and void.
The plaintiff demurred to the answer; and, the demurrer
having been sustained, judgment was rendered that the plaintiff recover of "said county, trustee for said township," the
amount of said coupons, with interest thereon and costs, and
that said county do pay the same "out and from taxes levied
on the taxable property of said township."
The county thereupon sued out this writ of error.
The case was argued by Mr. Willard P. Hall and Mr. John
C. Gage for the plaintiff in error, and by Hr. John B. Henderson for the defendant in error.
The plaintiff in error submitted the following propositions:
1. The Township Aid Act of 1868, under which the bonds
in suit were issued, is repugnant to the Constitution of Missouri
of 1865. It authorizes a municipal subscription to the capital
stock of railroad companies, if two-thirds of the qualified voters
voting at an election held under its provisions are in favor of
it, whereas the Constitution requires the assent of two-thirds
of all the qualified voters to render such subscription valid.
Suffcient notice of this objection appears in the recitals of
the bonds to put the holder on inquiry. State v. lVinkelmeier,
85 Mo. 103 ; State v. Sutterfield, 54 id. 391; Harshman v.
Bates County, 92 U. S. 569.
2. The record shows that the bonds were issued in payment
of a subscription, by the township, to the capital stock of a
railroad company which had no existence when the tax-payers
petitioned for an election to take the sense of the people upon
the question of the subscription, and when the election was
ordered. They are, therefore, invalid, even in the hands of an
innocent holder. Bubey v. Shain et al., 54 Mo. 207; The
People v. Franlin,5 Lans. (N. Y.) 129.
3. The bonds are to all intents and purposes township, not

county, bonds. The county has incurred no liability to pay
them. They are to be paid out of a special fund, derived from
a tax upon the real and personal property within the township.
The levy of that tax is imposed on the county court. A mandamus to compel the requisite levy is the appropriate and
exclusive remedy of the bond-holder. An action on them
will not lie against the county, and the judgment rendered in
this case is evidently erroneous. The State v. Linn Ccunty,
44 Mo. 504; State v. J"ustices of Bollinger County, 48 id. 475.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
The first question presented for our determination in this
case is, whether the "Township Aid Act" of Missouri is repugnant to art. 11, sect. 14, of the Constitution of that State,
inasmuch as it authorizes subscriptions by townships to the
capital stock of railroad companies whenever two-thirds of
the qualified voters of the township, voting at an election called
for that purpose, shall vote in favor of the subscription, while
the Constitution prohibits such a subscription, "unless twotown, at a regular or
thirds of the qualified voters of the ..
thereto."
assent
special election to be held therein, shall
In iarshnanv. Bates County, 92 U. S. 569, we incidentally
decided the act to be unconstitutional; but the point then specially in controversy was as to the applicability of this constitutional prohibition to township organizations. It was impliedly
conceded upon the argument that, if the Constitution did apply,
the law could not be sustained; and we accepted this concession
as truly stating the law of Missouri. Now, however, the ques.
tion is directly presented, whether the provisions of the Constitution and the statute are not substantially the same. On the
one hand, it is contended that the Constitution requires the
actual vote of two-thirds of the qualified voters of the township in favor of the subscription; and, on the other, that the
requisite assent is obtained if two-thirds of those voting at
the prescribed election shall vote to that effect.
The Supreme Court of Missouri has often been calied upon
to construe and give effect to this statute, and has never in a
single instance expressed a doubt as to its validity. The first

COUNTY OF CASS V. JOHNSTON.

[Sup. Ct.

case was that of The State v. Linn County, 44 Mo. 504, decided
in 1869, the year after the law was passed. That was an application for a mandamus to compel the county court to issue
bonds upon a subscription made pursuant to a vote under the
law; and it was contended that the act was repugnant to art. 11,
sect. 14, of the Constitution, because the bonds to be issued
were the bonds of the county and not of the township, and the
voters of the county had not given their assent; but the court
held that they were the bonds of the township, and granted the
writ. Following this are the cases of Ranney v. Baeder, 50
Mo. 600; 3IcPike v. Pen, 51 id. 63, decided in 1872; State v.
Cunningham, 51 id. 479; Rubey v. Shain, 54 id. 207, decided
in 1873; State v. Bates County, 57 id. 70, decided in 1874;
State v. Clarcson, 59 id. 149, decided in 1875; State v. Daviess
County, 64 id. 31 ; and State v. Cooer County, id. 170, decided
in 1876, -in all of which the act was in some form brought
under consideration, and in no one was there a suggestion of
its unconstitutionality by either court or counsel.
It is true that the objection now made to the law was in no
case presented or considered; but this is sufficiently explained
by the fact that in other cases a construction adverse to
such a position had been given to language similar to that em..
ployed in the constitutional prohibition. In State v. Winkel.
meier, 35 id. 103, decided in 1864, just previous to the adoption
of the Constitution, under a law which empowered the city
authorities of St. Louis to grant permission for the opening of
establishments for the sale of refreshments on any day in the
week, "whenever a majority of the legal voters of the city"
authorized them to do so, it was held that there must be a
majority of the voters participating in the election at which
the vote was taken, and not merely a majority of those voting
upon that particular question. The judge who delivered the
opinion of the court did, indeed, say, "The act expressly requires
a majority of the legal voters; that is, of all the legal voters
of the city, and not merely of all those who at a particular time
choose to vote upon the question." But this niust be read in
connection with what follows, where it is said that "it appeared
that more than thirteen thousand voters participated in that
election, and that only five thousand and thirty-five persons

Oct. 1877.]

COUNTY

OF CASS V. JOHINSTON.

voted in favor of giving to the city authority, . . . and two
thousand and one persons voted against it ....
It is evident
that the vote of five thousand out of thirteen thousand is not
the vote of a majority." Taking the opinion as a whole, it is
apparent that there was no intention of deciding that resort
must be had elsewhere than to the records of the election at
which the vote was taken to ascertain whether the requisite
majority had been obtained. But, however this may be, in
1866 a similar question was presented to the same court in
State v. 3l1ayor of St. Joselh, 37 id. 270. There it was provided that the mayor and council of St. Joseph should cause all
propositions "to create a debt by borrowing money," to be
submitted "to a vote of the qualified voters of the city," and
that in all such cases it should require "two-thirds of such
qualified voters to sanction the same." A proposition to borrow
money for the improvement of streets was submitted to a vote
of the voters at an election called for that purpose, and resulted
in a majority in favor of the measure. The mayor declined
signing the necessary bonds, because "he was in doubt whether
the matter was to be determined by two-thirds of all the votes
polled at the special election, or by two-thirds of all the voters
resident in the city, absolutely, whether voting or not." Thereupon a suit was instituted to settle this question, and to compel
the mayor, by mnandamus, to issue the bonds. In giving its
decision, the court said: "We think it was sufficient that twothirds of all the qualified voters who voted at the special election, authorized for the express purpose of determining that
question, on public notice duly given, voted in favor of the
proposition. This was the mode provided by law for ascertaining the sense of the qualified voters of the city upon that
question. There would appear to be no other practicable way
in which the matter could be determined." The writ of mandam us was accordingly issued. The same year the question
came up again in State v. Binder, 38 id. 450. In that case the
point arose under the refreshment act of St. Louis, which was
considered in State v. Winkelmeier. It appeared that the
authority to grant the permission in question was given at a
special election called for that purpose, and that out of a vote
of seven thousand and eighty-five, five thousand and fifty-one

COUNTY OF CASS V. JOHNSTON.

[Sup. Ct.

were in favor of the grant, and two thousand and thirty-four
against it. The cases of State v. Winielmeier and State v. St.
Joseph were both referred to; and, after quoting from the opinion
in the latter case, it was said: "We think the case made here
comes within the reasoning and the principles of that decision,
namely, that an election of this kind, authorized for the very
purpose of determining that question, on public notice duly
given, was the mode contemplated by the legislature, as well
as by the law, for ascertaining the sense of the legal voters
upon the question submitted, and that there could not well be
any other practicable way in which such a matter could be
determined." These decisions had all been made, and had
never been questioned, when the act of 1868, now under consideration, was passed. They were also in force, as evidence
of the law of the State, when the bonds in controversy were
issued; and, so far as we are advised, there has been no disposition since on the part of the courts of the State to modify
them. In State v. Sutterfield, 54 id. 391, the question was as
to the construction of another clause in the Constitution ; and
the decision was placed expressly on the ground of a difference
between the two provisions. That court has in the strongest
language intimated its unwillingness to interfere with its previous adjudications when property has been acquired or money
invested under them. Smith v. Clark County, id. 58; State v.
Sutterfield, supra.
In St. Joseph Township v. Rogers, 16 Wall. 644, this court
gave the same construction to the phrase, "a majority of the
legal voters of a township," as used in an Illinois municipal
aid statute; and Mr. Justice Clifford, in delivering the opinion,
uses this language: "It is insisted by the plaintiff that the
legislature, in adopting the phrase, 'a majority of the legal
voters of the township,' intended to require only a majority of
the legal voters of the township voting at an election notified
and held to ascertain whether the proposition to subscribe for
the stock of the company should be accepted or rejected; and
the court is of the opinion that such is the true meaning of the
enactment, as the question would necessarily be ascertained by
a count of the ballot." Among other authorities cited in support of this proposition is the case of State v. Mayor of St.

Oct. 1877.]

COUNTY OF CAsS V. JOHNSTON.

Joseph, supra. This we understand to be the established rule
as to the effect of elections, in the absence of any statutory
regulation to the contrary. All qualified voters who absent
themselves from an election duly called are presumed to assent
to the expressed will of the majority of those voting, unless
the law providing for the election otherwise declares. Any
other rule would be productive of the greatest inconvenience,
and ought not to be adopted, unless the legislative will to that
effect is clearly expressed. Louisville J' Nashville Railroad Co.
v. The County Court of Davidson et al., 1 Sneed (Tenn.), 688;
Taylor v. Taylor, 10 Minn. 107; People v. Warfield, 20 Ill. 159;
People v. Garner, 47 id. 246; People v. Wiant, 48 id. 263.
We conclude, therefore, that the Supreme Court of Missouri,
when it decided the case of The State v. Linn County, and held
the law in question to be constitutional, did not overlook
the objection which is now made, but considered it settled by
previous adjudications. That case is, therefore, to be considered as conclusive upon this question, as well as upon that which
was directly considered and decided, and, as a rule of State
statutory and constitutional construction, is binding upon us.
It follows that our decision in Harshmanv. Bates County, in so
far as it declares the law to be unconstitutional, must be overruled.
It is further insisted that the bonds sued upon are invalid,
because the railroad company to which the subscription waz
voted was not incorporated until the day of the election; and
Bubey v. Shain, 54 Mo. 207, is cited in support of this objection. That case only decides, if it is to be regarded as authority, that a subscription cannot be made by a township until the
company is incorporated, or, rather, that township subscriptions
cannot be used to bring the company into existence. They
are, to use the language of the judge in his opinion, not to be
made the "nucleus around which aid is to be gathered." Here
the company had been incorporated when the subscription was
made. The decision relied upon, therefore, does not apply,
and we are not inclined to extend its operation. This makes
it unnecessary to inquire whether this defence could be maintained as against an innocent holder.
It is finally objected, that, as the bonds are in fact the bonds of
VOL. V.

[Sup. CL

the township, no action can be maintained upon them against the
county. Without undertaking to decide what would be the
appropriate form of proceeding to enforce the obligation in
the State courts, it is sufficient to say that in the courts of the
United States we are entirely satisfied with the conclusions
reached by the court below, and that a judgment may be rendered against the county, to be enforced, if necessary, by mandamus against the county court or the judges thereof, to compel
the levy and collection of a tax in accordance with the provisions of the law under which the bonds were issued. The
reasoning of the learned circuit judge in Jordanv. 0ase County1,
3 Dill. 185, is to our minds perfectly conclusive upon this subject, and we content ourselves with a simple reference to that
case as authority upon this point.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JusTIcE BRADLEY, with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE
MIaLLER, dissenting.
I feel obliged to adhere to the opinion given in Harshmanv.
Bates County1, 92 U. S. 569. If the Missouri convention which
framed the Constitution of 1865 desired to prevent municipal subscriptions to railroad and other enterprises, except by
the consent of a majority of the people qualified to vote in the
district to be affected, I do not see what language could have
been adopted more apt for the purpose than that which is
actually used in the fourteenth section of art. 11 : "The General Assembly shall not authorize any county, city or town to
become a stockholder in, or to loan its credit to, any company,
association, or corporation, unless two-thirds of the qualified
voters of such county, city, or town, at a regular or special
election to be held therein, shall assent thereto." The literal
meaning of this clause seems to me unmistakably to require
two-thirds of the qualified voters, whether they vote or not.
The language is just as strong as that of the twenty-fourth
section of art. 4, which declares that "no bill shall be passed
unless by the assent of a majority of all the members elected
to each branch of the General Assembly." This clause has
always been construed to mean that no law can be passed
unless a majoiity of the members vote for it, whether all are

CUUNTY OF CASS V. JoE'N:TON.

present or not. And the reason of the requirement in the
former case is as strong as in the latter. The people who are
to pay the taxes for raising a subscription to a railroad ought
not to be subjected to that burden, unless the requisite majority
of the class named, that is, the qualified voters, can be induced
to give their assent to it. In the one case, as in the other,
absence and failure to vote is equivalent to a dissent. . concede that if the Supreme Court of Missouri has given a contrary
construction to the clause, which has become the settled law of
the State, we should be governed by it. But I do not understand that this has been done. In State v. Wnkcelmei'r, 85
Mo. 103, which was decided just before the adoption of the
Constitution, the question arose upon the act of 1857, which
declared that "the corporate authorities of the different cities
in the county of St. Louis shall have the power, whenever a
majority of the legal voters of the respective cities in said
comty authorize them to do so, to grant permission for the
opening of any establishment within the corporate limits of
said cities for the sale of refreshments on any day in the week."
At an election in St. Louis, five thousand persons voted in
favor of giving to the city authority to grant permission to open
establishments for the sale of refreshments on Sunday, and two
thousand voted against it. The court held, that, in order to
confer the requisite authority under the act, it required "a
majority of the legal voters, that is, of all the legal voters, of
the city, and not merely of all those who might, at a particular
time, choose to vote upon the question." This was the express
language of the court; and as at that election more than thirteen thousand voters participated in voting for the officers to
be elected, it was apparent from the election returns themselves,
without looking further, that a majority of the legal voters of
the city had not voted for the authority; and hence it was decided that no authority had been given. It is evident that the
court would have come to the same conclusion had it been shown
in any other way that less than a majority of the legal voters
voted for the authority. The mode of ascertaining the whole
number of legal voters was not prescribed by the law. In that
case, it sufficiently appeared from the election returns themselves.
There is no valid reason why the same conclusion should not

COUNTY OF CASS V. JOHNSTON.

[Sup. Ct.

be deduced from a registry of the legal voters. The objection
that some persons not entitled t6 vote may be registered has
no force to my mind. If any one choose to raise that issue, it
might be open for him to do so; but the registry would certainly furnish primafacie evidence of the number of legal or
qualified voters.
After the Constitution was adopted, a case arose on that clause
of the Constitution which declares, art. 4, sect. 30, " that the
General Assembly shall have no power to remove the county
seat of any county, unless two-thirds of the qualified voters of
the county, at a general election, shall vote in favor of such removal. This was the case of State v. Sutterfield, 54 id. 391;
and the court, in an elaborate argument, again held that these
terms require a positive vote in the affirmative of two-thirds of
the qualified voters of the county; and the court expressly
says, "There is no difficulty in ascertaining what that number is, since the same Constitution provides for a registration,
and points out who the qualified voters are."
In the cases re'ied on by the defendaht in error, the precise
question now under consideration was not presented to the Supreme Court of Missouri. They mostly related to forms of
phraseology different from that under consideration, and are
distinguishable therefrom in several particulars, which it is unnecessary now to examine. The leading case of The State v.
Linn County, 44 id. 504, was cursorily examined in Harshman
v. Bates County. But, not desiring to prolong this opinion by
entering into a critical examination of those cases, I will simply
remark, that, taking them all together, the weight of authority
in Missouri is, in my judgment, on the side of the interpretation which I still feel constrained to give to the constitutional
clause in question.
