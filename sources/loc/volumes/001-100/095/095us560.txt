over passing it through one formed by right lines.
4. There having been no infringement by the defendants of the rights of the

APPEALS from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern District of New York.
This is a suit by Paul Dennis against Daniel Eddy, Walden
Eddy, and Abram Reynolds, doing business as Eddy & Co., for
an infringement of reissued letters-patent No. 1515, granted to
the complainant Aug. 4, 1868, being a reissue of original letters
No. 19,412, which bear date Feb. 23, 1858. The specification
and drawings of the reissue are as follows "To all whom it may concern:
"Be it known that I, Paul Dennis, of Bemis Heights, in the
county of Saratoga, and State of New York, have invented a
new and improved shovel-plow, and I do hereby declare that the
following is a full, clear, and exact description of the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, making a part of
this specification, in which Fig. 1 is a side view of my invention;
Fig. 2, a back view of the same; Fig. 8, a plan or top view of the
same. Similar letters of reference indicate corresponding parts in
the several figures.
"This invention consists in a peculiar manner of constructing or
forming the upper edge of the mould-board, with recesses, so that
the earth, as the implement is drawn along, will pass over the top
of the mould-board and drop into the farrow behind it, and partially or wholly fill the same, thereby leaving the earth in a level

EDDY v. DENNIS.

and also in a loose, light, or pliable state, permeable to air and
moisture, and at the same time preventing earth, sods, stone, &e.
being cast against the growing plants by the mould-board, a contingency of frequent occurrence in using the ordinary plows.
"The invention further consists in the employment or use of a
gauge applied to the implement in such a manner as to admit of
the mould-board penetrating the soil at a greater or less distance,
as may be desired.
"To enable those skilled in the art to fully understand and construct my invention, I will proceed to describe it.
"A represents a metallic bar, which is curved so that the front part
will form the beam of the implement, and the back part an inclined
portion to which the mould-board B is firmly attached. The form
of the bar A is clearly shown in Fig. 1.
"To the bar A, near the centre of its curve or bend, the lower ends
of handles c care attached by a bolt, as shown ata. These handles
are braced by a V-shaped support, D, the lower end of which is secured to the bar A, as shown at b.
"The mould-board B is of shovel form, and is much like those usually made, with the exception that its upper edge or part is scalloped out so as to form a recess c at each side of the bar A, as
shown clearly in Figs. 2 and 3, said recesses extending down
nearly or about one-half the length of the mould-board. The
mould-board may be constructed of malleable cast-iron.
"E is the point or share, which is constructed of steel, the lower
end being pointed, and its sides slightly rounded or curved, so that
the form of the mould-board and point or share, when connected
together, will closely approximate to those which are cast in one
piece, the recesses c being excepted. The point or share E may be
attached to the mould-board B by bolts d, which are attached to
the under side of the point or share, and pass through a projecting
plate, e, at the under side of the mould-board. (See Figs. 1
and 2.)
"F is an adjustable metallic roller, which is attached to the bar A,
just back of the mould-board B. The axis of the roller F is fitted
or has its bearings in armsff, which project obliquely fiom a plate
g, said plate being slotted longitudinally, so that the bolts h I,
which secure the mould-board to the bar, may pass through said
slot, the bolts A having each a nut i on them, by screwing up which
the plate g, and consequently the roller F, may be secured higher or
lower, as desired.
"From the above description it will be seen that the point or share

[Sup. Ot.

E and mould-board B may be made to penetrate the soil at a greater
or less depth, as may be desired, by adjusting the roller F and
draught-chain, said roller serving as a gauge or guide, and the
draught-chain being adjusted at the end of the beam so that the
draught may aid the roller, and the point or share be made to have
a tendency to penetrate the soil or otherwise. This will be understood by referring to Fig. 1, in which it will be seen that, by depressing or lowering the roller on the bar, the mould-board will be less
inclined, and, consequently, if the draught-chain or whiffletree be
properly adjusted at the end of the beam, the point or share will have
a greater tendency to penetrate the earth than if the roller were
higher up on the bar, the roller always bearing upon the earth.
"The mould-board B does not cast the earth from either side as
usual, but the earth, in consequence of the recesses c c, will pass
over the top of the mould-board and drop behind it, so that no
furrow will be formed or left behind the mould-board, but the soil
will be left in a loose, light state, permeable to air and moisture, and
all grass, weeds, roots, and the like perfectly cut up. The mouldboard, by operating in this manner, does not, of course, cast earth,
sods, or stones upon the growing plants, as is frequently the case in
using the ordinary shovel-plows, which cast the earth from either
side of them. This is an important feature of the invention.
"The point or share E, also, in consequence of being made separate,
of steel, and attached to the mould-board, may be readily detached
and sharpened; and, when much worn, a new one may be attached
to the mould-board. The plow is, therefore, not only rendered far
more durable, bat it may always be kept in perfect order; for the
mould-board will last an indefinite period of time, if not being subjected to much wear, and the plow will always be in order, provided
the point or share is kept in proper condition. By my improvement
this can be done; but it cannot be done when the mould-board and
share are cast in one piece.
"The ordinary shovel-plows cannot be regulated by the draughtchain so as to regulate the depth of the furrow, for they have no
guide, the point or share merely penetrating the soil. The roller F
in my improvement diminishes friction, and serves as a more perfect
guide than the land-side of ordinary plows.
"Having thus described my invention, I wish it distinctly understood that I do not claim broadly the idea of passing a portion of
the earth over the mould-board into the furrow behind, as I am aware
that this has before been done.
"Neither do I claim applying a movable mould-board to one of

The court below, upon hearing, was of opinion that the defendants had infringed the first claim of the specification, but
not the second. An injunction was thereupon issued against
the defendants ; and they were decreed to pay the complainant
$596.50 damages, on account of gains and profits resulting from
the infringement. Both parties appealed to this court: Eddy
& Co. from so much of the decree as held them to be infringers,
and Dennis from that part limiting his damages to the amount
awarded him.
Mr.-Esek Cowen for Eddy & Co.
Mr..E
R. Bullard for Dennis.
MR.JUSTICE HUNT delivered the opinion of the court.
Dennis, the complainant below, obtained an injunction and
recovered damages against Eddy and others for an infringement
of his letters-patent for an improvement in "shovel plows."
The original letters were issued on the twenty-third day of
February, 1858, and the patent was reissued on the fourth day
of August, 1863.
The claim made under the reissued patent is in the words
following: -

"Having thus described my invention, I wish it distinctly undeistood that I do not claim broadly the idea of passing a portion of
the earth over the mould-board into the furrow behind, as I am

a movable mould-board to one of the outer edges of the share, as
described in an application of J. Drummond, rejected Oct. 25, 1844.
Neither do I claim the use of projecting blades at the outer ends

of the share, as described in the patent of B. Langdon, granted
June 22, 1842, and others; but,
"Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new and
desire to secure by letters-patent is, 1st, the inclined shovel mouldboard B, formed and mounted substantially as described, and constructed highest at its outer edges, so as to form on each side of tbe
standard A a recess c, through which recesses a portion of the earth
may, after rising upon the mould-board, descend into the furrow in
the rear of the plow.
"2d, The combination with the beam A and mould-board B of
the adjustable wheel F, arranged and operating substantiall) as and
for the p)urposes specified."
The original patent claimed only what is here described as
the second claim. The point of the reissue is in the claim as
first above set forth.
The use of the shovel-plow is in cultivating the soil between
the rows of growing crops, after they are somewhat advanced
in their growth, to stir up and loosen the soil, and to free it
from weeds. This plow is distinct in many parts of its construction, as well as in its intended effect, from the plow used
in breaking up the soil; that is, from the plow in common use.
In first considering the claim contained in both the original
and reissued patents, and in the latter described as the second
claim, we remark, that we concur entirely with the learned
judge who tried this case at the circuit, in his view of it.
The adjustable wheel is the important feature of this claim.
The bar or beam and the mould-board suggest nothing in the
way of novelty, invention, or of peculiarity. The use of the
base of a plow as a fulcrum, by means of which the plowman
can raise or lower the point of the plow, or turn it in different
directions, has long been in use, and on nearly every kind of
plow. Peter Dutton's stay-iron, rejected in 1865, affords an
illustration.
That an adjustable wheel was deemed by the inventor to be
quite a different thing from the simple bar or shoe in ordinary
use, is manifest from the careful description of its advantages
in the original patent. It is described in these words: "F is an adjustable metallic roller, which is attached to the bar
A, just back of the m-mud-board B. The axis of the roller F is

EDDY V. DENNIS.

[Sup. Ct.

fitted or has its bearings in armsff, which project obliquely from
a plate g, said plate being slotted longitudinally, so that bolts A h,
which secure the mould-board to the bar, may pass through said
slots, the bolts h having each a nut i on them, by screwing up
which the plate, and consequently the roller, may be secured higher
or lower, as may be desired."
It is also set forth that the point or share of the plow may
be made to penetrate the soil at a greater or less depth, by adjusting the roller and draught-chain; the roller serving as a
gauge or guide, and the draught-chain being adjusted at the
end of the beams, so that tho draught may aid the roller; the
point or share may be made to penetrate the soil, or otherwise.
The plows proved to have been manufactured by Eddy & Co.,
the defendants, have none of them this element of an adjustable wheel or roller. Their plow rests upon a plain bar or shoe
of iron. It has no mechanical contrivance for fixing the angle
at which the point shall penetrate the earth. This is done by
the strength of the plowman, who uses the shoe as a fulcrum
for that purpose.
No argument is needed to show that there has been no
violation by the defendants of the Dennis patent in this particular.
In considering the effect of the remaining claim of the reissue, we are greatly aided by the clear and explicit statement
of the patentee of what he does not claim as his invention.
There are three mechanical advantages in his plow, which
he says he does not claim to have invented: 1st, The idea of passing the earth over the mould-board into
the furrow behind. This result is really the fundamental advantage in both the plaintiff's and defendants' plows. In other
words, the principal benefit to be derived from either is found
in the fact that the earth, loosened and broken, will be deposited in the furrow behind the plow, the movable mouldboards and the projecting blades at the outer ends of the share
both contributing to this result. But the patentee says that
he is aware that this had been done before his invention,
and he makes no claim to an invention or discovery in this
respect.

Oct. 1877.J

EDDY v. DENNIS.

2d, The patentee does not claim the application of a movable mould-board to one of the outer edges of the share. This,
he says, was described in an application previously made (in
1844) by Drummond.
3d, The patentee does not claim the use of projecting blades
at the outer ends of the share. This had been described in a
patent granted to Langdon in 1842.
To these disclaimers we may add that he does not make a
claim for invention in using the shovel of this plow in an inclined form. He does not even give the angle of inclination at
which it shall be used, whether it shall be 750, like the old
plows, or 450, like this one. Ever since plows have been used,
- and there is no secular history of man in which the plow and
the hoe are not recorded, - we may safely believe that there
has been an inclination, sometimes greater and sometimes less,
in the shovel and mould-board. A perfectly upright shovel
would be nearly immovable, except in a light soil and to a
very sigh t depth, while one perfectly flat would be of little
value.
Remembering these four items as not being parts of the
plaintiff's invention, we are prepared to consider what he claims
to have invented and desires to secure by a patent. In his
own words, it is "the inclined shovel mould-board B, formed
and mounted substantially as described, and constructed highest at its outer edges, so as to form on each side of the standard
A a recess c, through which recesses a portion of the earth may,
after rising upon the mould-board, descend into the furrow in
the rear of the plow."
An inclined shovel mould-board, simply and alone, is not
spoken of as an invention. It had long been in use in other
plows. What the claim means to appropriate is a shovel
"formed and mounted and constructed as described." There
is nothing in the form of mounting- that is, placing it upon the
beam of the plow - that is peculiar. It is the construction that
gives it effect. How is it formed and mounted and constructed?
He says, in the general description, that it is a metallic bar so
formed or curved that the front will form the beam of the implement, and the back an inclined portion to which the mould
is attached, while the upper edge of the mould-board is so scol-

[Sup. Ut.

loped out as to form a recess over which the earth may pass, to
which is attached a metallic adjustable roller; serving as a gauge
or guide to regulate the depth that the point shall penetrate
the earth.
The defendants insisted that, like the other, this claim also
describes a combination, of which the adjustable roller is an
essential element, and that there can be no infringement unless
the roller is used. There is much force in this argument.
There is, also, another view of this part of the case. Eliminate from this description, first, the idea of an inclined shovel
or mould-board, and, second, the idea of passing the earth
over the plow into the furrow, both of which are outside of
the plaintiff's invention, and nothing remains, except a recess
formed by a scolloped edge -on which the earth will pass,
and an adjustable roller in connection with the beam of the
plow.
As has been before said, the defendants have never used the
adjustable roller. The infringement, then, if any, consists in the
use of a recess formed by a scolloped edge over which the earth
will pass. The learned judge at the circuit held that the patent
was good for this claim, and that the defendants had infringed
it. We have reached a different conclusion.
We think the use of the expression, "scolloped out so as to
form a recess," was not intended to say that the particular form
in which the recess was made should be that of a curve. A
scollop may, indeed, imply the idea of a curve, but in a vagne
and indefinite manner. It is as if it had been said, it "shall
be so cut out as to form a recess." The formation of the recess
was the idea in the mind of the draughtsman, with no reference
to any question of curved lines or right lines. That this was
the fact, is made evident by the absence of the, word "scolloped" in the claim itself, although used in the general description. If that form had been deemed material, it would have
been inserted where the patentee sets out with precision what
it is that he claims. In the claim, it is described by the words
"constructed highest at its outer edges, so as to form on each
side a recess" through which the earth may pass. A recess
made by the outer edges being higher than the inner parts was
the effect intended to be provided for, and that only. If it had

Oct. 1877.]

EDDY v. DENNIS.

. 569

been intended to describe a recess made by a curve, to the exclusion of a recess made in any other manner, it was very easy
to say so; but the patentee did not so say, and we think he did
not so mean.
If the patentee here had been the inventor of the mouldboard with a recess for the purpose of passing the earth through
it into the furrow behind, and had described his invention in the
words used in his reissued patent, would it not have included
as well a structure made by right lines as one made by curved
lines? In T'5nans v. Denmead, cited by the respondent's counsel, it is said, "Although a particular geometrical form is best
for a certain purpose, yet other forms, giving substantially the
same result, are infringements. The result need not be the same
in degree if it be the same in kind." 15 How. 344.
If'this be so, it can scarcely be denied that the words used in
this reissued patent include both forms of a recess, and that it
thereby claimed what was previously known and in use; to wit,
a structure for the passage of the earth into the furrow behind.
No testimony is given that the sod will be more thoroughly
broken, the earth better pulverized, or the furrows better filled
by the passage of the earth through a recess made by curved
lines, than by its passage through a recess of the same depth
made by straight lines. The plaintiffs, although witnesses,
gave no testimony to that effect. Of our own knowledge, we
do not know that it is so. As a matter of law, certainly we
are not able to decide that the right-lined recess is any less
efficacious for the purpose desired than a curved-line recess.
There is, indeed, testimony to show that the earth and sod
passing over the low mould-boards of the exhibit M were left
in a worse condition than when passed over the recess of the
Dennis plow.
In speaking on this subject, Henry Holmes says that it left
the furrow behind hard and flat, as if a log had been drawn
between the rows. The witness Broughton speaks of it as
throwing a double furrow outward, and as leaving the furrow
bare behind.
But neither of these witnesses attribute the excellences of the
one plow or the defects of the other to the existence of curved
or straight lines in forming the recess.

EDDY v. DENNIS.

[Sup. Ct.

To recapitulate :
1. The second claim of the plaintiff's specificati(n, "the combination with the beam A and the mould-board B with the
adjustable wheel F, arranged and operating substantially as
used for the purposes specified," gives no cause of action. It
is a claim for a combination of which the adjustable wheel F is
an essential element; and it is not pretended by any one that
the .defendants have ever used an adjustable wheel in the plows
made by them.
2. The first claim does not cover an inclined shovel mouldboard simply, nor does it cover the principle of passing the
earth over the recess of the plow into the furrow behind, nor
does the claim cover the passage of the earth over a recess
formed exclusively with a curved edge. Its effect is to provide
for a recess cut or carved out for the purpose intended. This
is not novel, the evidence showing many instances prior to the
plaintiff's original patent in which the principle and process had
been used and patented.
8. There is no evidence to show that there is any advantage
in passing the earth through a recess formed by curved lines,
rather than through a recess formed by right lines.
For these reasons, the decree of the court below must be
reversed.
As Dennis has no cause of action, the question of the amount
of damages cannot arise.
-Decreereversed, and cause remanded with instructions to dismiss the hill with costs.
