The owner in fee of land and of the buildings thereon, to whom has been issued
a policy of fire insurance, which provides that "if the interest of the assured
in the property be any other than the entire, unconditional, and sole ownership of the property for the use and benefit of the assured, or if the buildings
insured stand on leased ground, it must be so represented to the company, and
so expressed in the written part of the policy, otherwise the policy shall be
void," is entitled, upon their destruction by fire, to recover on his policy;
although, at the time it was issued, there was an outstanding lease for years
of the land to a third party, which fact was neither so represented to the company nor expressed in the written part of the policy.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern District of Illinois.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Mr. Lawrence Proudfoot for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. Bobert Hervey, contra.
MR. JUSTIcE CL=FORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Policies of fire insurance are contracts whereby the insurers
undertake for a stipulated sum to indemnify the insured against
loss or damage by fire, in respect to the property covered by
the policy, during the prescribed period of time, to an amount
not exceeding the sum specified in the written contract. Angell,
Fire and Life Ins. 43.
Insurance was effected by the plaintiffs, on the 9th of May,
1870, in the company of the corporation defendant for the
term of one year, against loss or damage by fire, to the amount
of $3,000, covering the ten buildings therein described, each
of which being insured in the sum of $8300.
It appears by the bill of exceptions that the policy was in
the usual form of policies issued by the defendant, and that it
provided that "if the interest of the assured in the property

be any other than the entire, unconditional, and sole ownership
of the property for the use and benefit of the assured, or if the
buildings insured stand on leased ground, it must be so represented to the company, and be so expressed in the written part
of the policy, otherwise the policy shall be void."
Two other stipulations are contained in the policy, which it
is important to notice: 1. That "the use of general terms, or
any thing less than a distinct specific agreement clearly expressed
and indorsed on the policy, shall not be construed as a waiver
of any printed or written condition or restriction therein."
2. That the policy is made and accepted in reference to the
foregoing terms and conditions, which are declared to be a part
of the contract, and may be used and resorted to in order to
determine the rights and obligations of the parties to the policy.
Nothing was expressed in the written part of the policy indicating or tending to indicate that the interest of the insured
in the property purporting to be insured was any other than
the entire, unconditional, and sole ownership of such property
for the use and benefit of the insured, or indicating or tending
to indicate that the buildings insured stood on leased ground.
Payment of the alleged loss being refused, the plaintiffs instituted the present suit in the State court, which was subsequently removed into the Circuit Court of the same district,
the parties agreeing that the plaintiffs might prove any claim
they have under the common counts as if they should add
special counts, and that the defendants might prove any defence
they have to the action under the general issue the same as if
it was set up in a special plea.
Pursuant to that stipulation, the parties went to trial; and
the verdict and judgment were for the plaintiffs in the sum of
$3,730 damages, with costs of suit. Exceptions were taken by
the defendants to the charge of the court; and they sued out a
writ of error, and removed the cause into this court.
Neither title-deeds nor evidence of the same was introduced
by the plaintiffs; but the defendant admitted at the trial that
"the plaintiffs were owners in fee of the land on which the
buildings insured stood" at the time of the fire, as appears by
the bill of exceptions. Proofs were introduced by the plaintiffs,
admitted by the defendant to be in due form, which showed

INSURANCE

C0.

V. HAVEN.

[Sup. Ot.

that the buildings described in the policy were, on Dec. 31,
1870, destroyed by fire, and that the property insured belonged
to the plaintiffs, subject to the lease mentioned in the proofs
so introduced, to which more particular reference will presently
be made. Other evidence was introduced by the plaintiffs, but
the defendant offered no evidence; and the court directed the
jury to return a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for the amount
of the policy, with interest from the expiration of sixty days
subsequent to the time the proof of loss was exhibited.
Seasonable exceptions were filed to the charge of the court,
upon the ground that the lease mentioned in the proofs of loss
show that the plaintiffs were not at the time of the loss the
entire, unconditional, and sole owners of the property for their
own use and benefit.
Sufficient appears to show that the fee-simple title of the
land was in the plaintiffs, and that they were the entire owners
of the property destroyed, subject to the lease mentioned in
the proofs of loss; and it was admitted by the defendant that
the fire caused a total loss of the property, and that the value
of the buildings exceeded the amount of the insurance.
By the terms of the lease, referred to in the proofs of loss, it
appears that the instrument was for a term of ten years, from
May 1, 1868, to May 1, 1878, and that it covered the land on
which the insured buildings stood, and the buildings and improvements to be built thereon, having been executed before
the buildings were erected, at a rental of $3,500 per annun for
the first five years, and $5,976 per annum for the second five
years.
Ten buildings were to be erected, to cost not less than $24,000;
and the lessor was to pay one-half the amount in instalments,
each instalment to be $1,000, and to be paid when the lessee
had expended twice that amount in the prosecution of the work.
Arrangements of a contingent character are also prescribed in
case the lease is continued or determined, and for the basis of
adjustment in either event and for payment or repayment as
the case may be, which it is not necessary to reproduce in the
present case.
Errors assigned material to be noticed are as follows: 1. That
the court erred in directing the jury to r~turn a verdict in

Oct. 1877.]

INSURANCE

Co.

v. HAVEN.

favor of the plaintiffs for the amount of the policy and interest.
2. That the court should have directed the jury to return a verdict the other way, as the law of the case was with the defendant. 3. That the court erred in not submitting the questions
of fact to the jury whether the plaintiffs were so far the sole,
entire, and unconditional owners of the property insured as to
be entitled to recover in view of the evidence.
Authorities to prove that a fee-simple estate is the highest
tenure known to the law are quite unnecessary, as the principle
is elementary and needs no support; nor is any argument necessary to show that the title of the plaintiffs to the land where
the buildings stood was of that character, as that is admitted
in the bill of exceptions, which constitutes a part of the
record.
Concede that, and it follows that the plaintiffs were, within
the meaning of the policy, the entire, unconditional, and sole
owners of the land where the buildings stood, for their own use
and benefit, at the time of the fire; and, if so, the prhma facie
presumption must be that they held the title of the buildings
by the same fee-simple title, in the absence of any evidence
in the case to controvert that conclusion. None certainly was
introduced by the defendant, and it is not pretended that there
is any thing in the proofs introduced by the plaintiffs to su'pport any different theory, except the lease referred to in the
evidence offered to prove the loss.
Land-owners under a fee-simple title, in the absence of any
proof to the contrary, are certainly presumed to be the owners
of the buildings erected and standing on the premises; the rule
being that the buildings and the lands together are known as
real estate, and the buildings, where nothing is shown to the
contrary, are presumed to be held by the fee-simple owner of
the land by the same title as the land on which the buildings
are situated, from which it follows that the plaintiffs, being the
owners in fee of the same, are also the owners in fee of the
buildings, unless there is something in the terms of the lease
to disprove that theory; and it is equally clear, that, if they
are the entire, unconditional, and sole owners of the buildings
as well as of the land, the assignment of error must be overruled.

INSURANCE C0. V. HAVEN.

[Sup. Ct.

Nor is any thing contained in the lease to support any different theory. Instead of that, the lease shows that the plaintiffs
were the owners of the land, and that the contractor agreed to
erect the ten buildings on the land for the owners; nor does it
make any difference that the owners of the land contracted
with the builder that they, when the buildings were erected,
would lease the same to him for the term of ten years.
Buildings of every kind are frequently erected by land-owners
to be rented; nor is it any thing uncommon that the contract
for lease should be made before the buildings are erected, or
that the contract for a lease should be blended with the contract for erecting the building, as in this case. Leases of the
kind are not uncommon; nor is there any thing in the terms
of the instrument to countenance the theory that the title of
the plaintiffs did not remain as before, - a fee-simple title, as
described in the admission of the defendant.
In the words of the contract, the lessee agreed to proceed at
once to erect ten buildings on the land therein described, to
cost not less than $24,000 for the other party to the instrument,
and "to receive payment for the same at the times and in the
manner therein described," which of itself shows to a demonstration that the buildings when erected became the property
of the plaintiffs, as the terms of the instrument called a lease
show that the buildings were erected for the plaintiffs on their
land, and that they paid the agreed price for their erection.
Decided support to that theory is also derived from another
clause of the lease, by which the lessee bound himself to insure the buildings during the time employed in their erection,
in the name and for the benefit of the plaintiffs, and to deposit
the policies in their keeping and possession. Policies were to
be taken out and kept in force in the sum of $13,000, in the
name and for the benefit of the lessors, during the continuance
of the lease, in companies to be approved by the plaintiffs; and
the stipulation was that the policies should be deposited with
lessors of the property. Other evidence to support the theory
of the defendant is entirely wanting, the record showing that
they offered no evidence at the trial; and inasmuch as the terms
of the lease show that the plaintiffs owned the land in fee-simple, and that they contracted to have the buildings erected and

Oct. 1877.]

INSURANCE CO. V. HAVEN.

paid for their erection, and caused them to be insured in their
own name and for their own benefit, it is clear that the supposed defence that the plaintiffs were not the entire, unconditional, and sole owners of the buildings utterly fails, and that
the charge of the court directing a verdict for the plaintiffs is
correct.
Attempt is made in this case to maintain the theory that the
plaintiffs are not the entire owners of the property, because it
was under lease both when the policy was issued and at the
time of the loss, but it is clear that the theory has no foundation in law or justice. Nor can the theory be sustained which
attempts to separate the ownership of the buildings from the
land, which, it is admitted, is vested in the plaintiffs by a feesimple title. Such an assumption is contrary to the facts exhibited in the record, and can no more be supported than that
the lessees of stores, tenement-houses, or other buildings in our
large cities own the same by mere possession or occupancy of
the particular store, tenement, or building included in the lease
they hold from the owner.
Thousands of cases arise where dwelling-houses, stores, and
)ther buildings of every kind are leased to occupants, for longer
)r shorter periods of time, and upon still more varying condiLions and stipulations, nd yet the owners procure insurance
upon the same without mentioning the names of the lessees in
the policies, or ever suspecting that they have omitted any
duty, or been guilty of any concealment or neglect. Insurance
companies set up no such pretence; and, if they should do so,
they would find no support to such a theory in the courts of
justice.
Stores and other buildings are sometimes erected upon leased
lands by parties who have no title other than what is derived
from their lease, which is a very different thing from the case
where the owner, both of the land and the building, leases
the estate to the occupant for a term of years, without parting
with the fee-simple title to the land or the building. Fee-simple
ownership in such a case is matter of importance to the insurer, especially if the company is a mutual one, as such companies usually have a lien on the premises for the payment of
the premium; nor is the ownership of the land an immaterial

INSURANCE Co. V.

HAVEN.

[Sup. Ot.

matter, even if no such lien arises, as it furnishes an important
element to enable the company to determine whether it is
expedient to take the risk.
Considerations of the kind, it may be presumed, induced the
defendant to insert the condition in the policy of the plaintiffs,
"that, if the buildings stand on leased ground, it must be so
represented to the company, and must be so expressed in the
written part of the policy, otherwise the policy shall be void."
Nothing of the kind is pretended in this case; and, if it were,
it could not be sustained for a moment, as it is admitted in the
record that the plaintiffs were the owners in fee of the land
where the buildings stood at the time of the fire.
Adjudged cases are invoked to sustain the theory of the
defence; but none of those cited support the proposition involved in the theory. Examples of the kind are Gahaganv.
-MutualInsurance Co., 43 N. H. 176, and Warner v. .iddlesex
Insurance Co., 21 Conn. 444, both of which are cases where
the insured represented that the property covered by the policy
was free and unincumbered, when, in fact, it was incumbered
by mortgage. May, Ins., sect. 290; Towne v. Mutual Insurance Co., 7 Allen (Mass.), 51.
Cases are also cited where the insured had only a bond for
a deed, or only a leasehold interest, lnd where the insured
procured a policy as the absolute owner of the property in the
face of those facts. Atlantic Insurance Co. v. Wright, 22 Ill.
474; Smith v. Mutual Insurance Co., 6 Cush. (Mass.) 448;
Brown v. Williams, 28 Me. 252; BYinman v. HYartford Insurance Co., 36 Wis. 167.
Much discussion of such authorities is not required, as it is
clear they do not favor the theory of the defendants. Nor
does the case of Smith v. Colombia Insurance Co., 17 Pa. St.
253, aid the defendants, as it is clear that, if a mortgagee
insures his interest in the premises, he is bound, under a provision calling for incumbrances affecting his interest, to state
prior mortgages on the same premises. May, Ins., sect. 293.
Misrepresentations of material facts, of course, avoid a policy; but there were none such in the case before the court.

INSURANCE

Co. v. HIAVEN.

Where the policy contained the provision that if the property to be insured is held in trust, or on commission, or is a
leasehold interest, or an equity of redemption, or if the interest
of the insured in the property is any other than the entire,
unconditional, and sole ownership of the property, for the use
and benefit of the insured, it must be so represented to the
company, and be so expressed in the written part of the policy,
otherwise the policy shall be void, the Supreme Court of Illinois held, in a case where it appeared that the property had
been sold under judgment and execution against the insured,
that the non-disclosure of the sale and purchase avoided the
policy, though the period allowed for redemption had not expired. Reaper City Insurance Co. v. Brennan, 58 I1. 158.
By the sale and purchase in that case, nothing was left in
the insured but the right of redemption, which would expire
in one year from the sale; and it was well held by the court
that, the paramount title being in a third person, it could not
be truthfully said that the insured had, at the date of the insurance, "the entire, unconditional, and sole ownership of the
property."
Beyond all doubt, the property in the case under consideration vested in the lessors; and, if so, the two cases cited by the
defendant of Mayor v. Hamilton Insurance Co., 10 Bosw. (N. Y.)
537, and ihallor v. Insurance Company, 9 id. 366, are authorities
in favor of the plaintiffs, as the facts in this case show that the
property, in the true sense of insurance law, belonged to the
insured at the date of the policy. Washington & Atlantic
Insurance Co. v. Kelly, 32 Md. 438 ; Hubbard v. Hartford Insurance Co., 33 Iowa, 333.
Unless the true ownership or interest in the property is required by the conditions of the policy to be specifically and
with particularity and accuracy set forth, it will in general be
sufficient if the insured has an insurable interest under any
status of ownership or possession, in cases where no inquiries
are made at the time the application is presented or the policy
executed. May, Ins., sect. 284.
No inquiry was made in this case, although it appears that
the agent of the company who took the insurance resided in
Chicago, where the buildings were situated; nor did the de-

[Sup. ot.

fendant offer any evidence at the trial to show that the unincumbered fee-simple title was- not in the plaintiffs at the time
the buildings were destroyed by the fire; nor did the defendant request the court at the trial to give the jury any instructions upon the subject. On the contrary, it admitted at the
trial that the plaintiffs were the owners in fee of the land on
which the buildings insured stood, leaving it to be inferred by
the jury that the plaintiffs were also the owners in fee of the
buildings.
Enough appears in the terms of the instrument called the
lease to show that both the lessee and lessors treated the buildings "during the process of erection" as the property of the
plaintiffs, and to show beyond controversy that the buildings
when completed vested in the plaintiffs as their absolute property, subject only to the right of the builder to occupy and
use the same, just as in the ordinary case where the owners
of property agree to lease the same to be used by the lessee for
a stipulated rent.
Lessees holding under an ordinary parol lease do not acquire
such an interest in real estate so leased as to avoid a policy
issued to the lessor, even though the insured failed to represent
the matter to the company in a case where no inquiries were
made of the applicant, at the time the policy was issued, as to
the true character of the title or occupancy of the insured
premises, and where no pretence is shown that the insured has
been guilty of any fraud or misrepresentation.
Such a lease is a mere chattel interest, being reckoned as
part of the personal estate of the lessee, and in case of the
death of the lessee goes to his executors, and not to the
heirs-at-law, as appears by all the authorities. 2 B1. Com.

Leases for years, says Taylor, are considered chattel interests arising out of a contract between the parties, and pass
only a transient interest in the land, which is not a freehold,
and might originally be made at common law by parol for any
certain period. Taylor, L. & T. (6th ed.) 22; itosder v.

Two requisites, says Blackstone, were necessary to make a
fief or feud, -1. Duration as to time; 2. Immobility as to
place: and he adds, that whatever was not a feud was accounted
a chattel.
Chattels real, says the same commentator, are such as concern or savor of the realty, including terms for years, and are
called real chattels, as being interests arising out of or being
annexed to real estate, of which they have one quality, to wit,
immobility, but want the quality of indeterminate duration,
the want of which constitutes them chattels. 2 B1. Com. 386;

Insurers, if they desire to object to such a risk, should make
inquiries of the applicant, and should not admit at the trial,
without qualification, that the insured was the owner in fee of
the land, in a case where they offer no evidence in defence.
