The law of laches, like the principle of the limitation of actions, was dictated by experience, and is founded in a salutary
policy. The lapse of time carries with it the memory and life
of witnesses, the muniments of evidence, and other means of
proof. The rule which gives it the effect prescribed is necessary to the peace, repose, and welfare of society. A departurefrom it would open an inlet to the evils intended to be excluded.
Upon the whole case, we are of the opinion that the county isnot entitled to the relief sought.

CONTINENTAL IMPROVEMENT COMPANY V. STEAD.
1. Travellers upon a common highway which crosses a railroad upon the samelevel, and the railroad company running a train, have mutual and reciprocal
duties and obligations; and, although the train has the right of way, the
same degree of care and diligence in avoiding a collision is required from
each of them.
2 That right does not, therefore, impose upon such a traveller the whole duty of
avoiding a collision, but is accompanied with and conditioned upon the duty
of the train to give due and timely warning of its approach.

3 The degree of diligence to be used on either side is such as a prudent man
would exercise under the circumstances of the case in endeavoring fairly to

perform his duty.
4. It belongs to the judge to exercise discretion as to the style and form in which

he expounds the law and comments upon the facts.

His duty is discharged

if his instructions to the jury correctly state, although not in the ipsissirna

verba of counsel, the whole law applicable to the case.

[Sup. Ct.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Submitted on printed arguments by lkessrs. ffughes, O'Brien,
SSmiley for the plaintiff in error, and by fr. J. J. Coombs,
contra.
MR. JUSTICE, BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a case of collision near the village of Lima, in La
Grange County, Indiana, between a train of passenger cars of
the plaintiff in error and the wagon of the defendant in error.
The latter brought the action below to recover the damages
done to himself and his wagon, and recovered a verdict. The
present writ of error is brought to review the instructions given
by the court to the jury on the trial. The case, as appears by
the bill of exceptions, was substantially as follows: The collision occurred. in a cut about five feet in depth, in which the
wagon-road crossed the railroad. on a level therewith nearly at
right angles, descending to it on each side by an excavation.
The train was a special one, coming from the north, and did
not stop at the station, which was four hundred or five hundred feet north of the crossing, and none of the regular trains
were due at that time, although special trains were occasionally run over the road. The plaintiff was going east, away
from the village, following another wagon, and in approaching the railroad track could not see a train coming from
the north, by reason of the cut and intervening obstructions.
There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff, though
he looked to the southward (from which direction the next
regular train was to come), did not look northwardly; that his
wagon produced much noise as it moved over the frozen ground;
that his hearing was somewhat impaired; and that he did not
stop before attempting to cross the track; also, evidence tending to show that the engineer in charge of the train used all
efforts in his power to stop it after he saw the plaintiff's wagon
on the track. The evidence was conflicting as to whether the
customary and proper signals were given by those in charge of
the locomotive, and as to the rate of speed the train was running at the time, some witnesses testifying that it was at an
unusual and improper rate, and others the contrary.
The counsel for the railroad company requested the court tc

adopt certain specific instructions, to the general effect that the
plaintiff should have looked out for the train, and was chargeable with negligence in not having done so; that there was
nothing peculiar in the crossing to forbid as high a rate of speed
as would be proper in the case of other important highways;
that an engineer is not bound to look to the right or left, but
only ahead on the line of the railway, and has a right to expect
that persons and teams will keep out of the way of the locomotive; and that it is the duty of those crossing the railroad
to listen and look both ways along the railroad before going on
it, and to ascertain whether a train is approaching or not.
The judge refused to adopt the instructions framed by counsel,
but charged, in effect, as follows: that both parties were bound
to exercise such care as, under ordinary circumstances, would
avoid danger; such care as men of common prudence and intelligence would ordinarily use under like circumstances; that
the amount of care required depended on the risk of danger;
that, where the view was obstructed so that parties crossing the
railroad could not see an approaching train, the exercise of
greater care and caution was required on both sides: as well
on the part of those having the management of the train as of
those crossing the railroad; that the former should approach
the crossing at a less rate of speed, and use increased diligence
to give warning of their approach; and, if the train was a
special one, it was still more incumbent upon them in going
through such a place to slacken their speed and sound the
whistle and ring the bell, than if the train were running on
regular time; and, on the other hand, that the party crossing
with a team should proceed with more caution and circumspection than if the crossing were in an open country, and not
venture upon the track without ascertaining that no train was
approaching, or at least without using the means that common
prudence would dictate to ascertain such fact; but that, if a
train were not a regular one, no train being due at the time,
the same degree of caution would not be expected on his part
as if it were a regular train and on usual time. In short, the
judge charged that the obligations, rights, and duties of railroads
and travellers upon highways crossing them are mutual and
reciprocal, and no greater degree of care is required of the one

[Sup. Ct.

than of the other. He further charged, that the plaintiff could
not have a verdict unless the persons in charge of the train were
guilty of negligence or want of due care, and unless the plaintiff himself were free from any negligence or carelessness which
contributed to the injury. The evidence of the case was fairly
submitted to the jury in the light of the principles thus announced.
This is the general scope of the charge; and we think it is
in accordance with well-settled law and with good sense. If
a railroad crosses a common road on the same level, those travelling on either have a legal right to pass over the point of crossing, and to require due care on the part of those travelling on
the other, to avoid a collision. Of course, these mutual rights
have respect to other relative rights subsisting between the
parties. From the character and momentum of a railroad train,
and the requirements of public travel by means thereof, it cannot be expected that it shall stop and give precedence to an
approaching wagon to make the crossing first: it is the duty
of the wagon to wait for the train. The train has the preference and right of way. But it is bound to give due warning
of its approach, so that the wagon may stop and allow it to
pass, and to use every exertion to stop if the wagon is inevitably in the way. Such warning must be reasonable and timely.
But what is reasonable and timely warning may depend on
many circumstances. It cannot be such, if the speed of the
train be so great as to render it unavailing. The explosion of
a cannon may be said to be a warning of the coming shot; but
the velocity of the latter generally outstrips the warning. The
speed of a train at a crossing should not be so great as to render
unavailing the warning of its whistle and bell; and this caution
is especially applicable when their sound is obstructed by winds
and other noises, and when intervening objects prevent those
who are approaching the railroad from seeing a coming train.
In such cases, if an unslackened speed is desirable, watchmen
should be stationed at the crossing.
On the other hand, those who are crossing a railroad track
are bound to exercise ordinary care and diligence to ascertain
whether a train is approaching. They have, indeed, the greatest incentives to caution, for their lives are in imminent danger

CONTINENTAL IMPROVEMENT CO. v. STEAD.

165

if collision happen; and hence it will not be presumed, without evidence, that they do not exercise proper care in a particular case. But notwithstanding the hazard, the infirmity of the
human mind in ordinary men is such that they often do manifest
a degree of negligence and temerity entirely inconsistent with
the care and prudence which is required of them, - such, namely,
as an ordinarily prudent man would exercise under the circum
stances. When such is the case, they cannot obtain reparation
for their injuries, even though the railroad company be in fault.
They are the authors of their own misfortune. These propositions are so indisputable, that they need no reference to authorities to support them. We think the judge was perfectly right,
therefore, in holding that the obligations, rights, and duties
of railroads and travellers upon intersecting highways are mutual
and reciprocal, and that no greater degree of care is required
of the one than of the other. For, conceding that the railway
train has the right of precedence of crossing, the parties are
still on equal terms as to the exercise of care and diligence in
regard to their relative duties. The right of precedence referred
to does not impose upon the wagon the whole duty of avoiding
a collision. It is accompanied with, and conditioned upon, the
duty of the train to give due and timely warning of approach.
The duty of the wagon to yield precedence is based upon this
condition. Both parties are charged with the mutual duty
of keeping a careful lookout for danger; and the degree of
diligence to be exercised on either side is such as a prudent
man would exercise under the circumstances of the -case in
endeavoring fairly to perform his duty. The charge of the
judge was in substantial accordance with these views.
The mistake of the defendant's counsel consists in seeking
to impose upon the wagon too exclusively the duty of avoiding
collision, and to relieve the train too entirely from responsibility
in the matter. Railway companies cannot expect this immunity
so long as their tracks cross the highways of the country upon
the same level. The people have the same right to travel on
the ordinary highways as the railway companies have to run
trains on the railroads.
Perhaps some of the abstract propositions of the defendant's
counsel contained in the instructions asked for, based on the

166

CO. V. STEAD.

[Sup. Ct.

facts assumed therein, if such facts were conceded, or found in
a special verdict, would be technically correct. But a judge
is not bound to charge upon assumed facts in the ipsissima verba
of counsel, nor to give categorical answers to a juridical catechism
based on such assumption. Such a course would often mislead
the jury instead of enlightening them, and is calculated rather
to involve the case in the meshes of technicality, than to promote the ends of law and justice. It belongs to the judicial
office to exercise discretion as to the style and form in which
to expound the law and comment upon the facts. If a judge
states the law incorrectly, or refuses to state it at all, on a point
material to the issue, the party aggrieved will be entitled to a
new trial. But when he explains the whole law applicable to
the case in hand, as we think was done in this case, he cannot
be called upon to express it in the categorical form, based upon
assumed facts, which counsel choose to present to him. See
Mills v. Smith, 8 Wall. 27; Nudd v. Burrows, 91 U. S.426.
An examination of some of the principal instructions asked
for by the defendant's counsel will furnish an illustration of
the propriety of these views. The court was asked to instruct
the jury as follows: "cThe uncontradicted testimony in this case shows that the plaintiff was acquainted with the character of this crossing; that he
had frequently travelled it, and on some previous occasions had
stopped to look and listen before going upon the track; that upon
this occasion he went with his team and wagon upon the track without taking any precaution to ascertain whether a train was coming
fi'om the north or not; that he did not even turn his face northward along the track in the direction from which the train was
coming until it was too late for him to stop or turn back; that
his wagon was making considerable noise as it moved over the
frozen ground; that his hearing was to some extent impaired, but
he did not stop to listen before going upon the track.
"Upon this state of facts the plaintiff is chargeable with such
negligence contributing to the accident as deprives him of any right
of action."
Now, although the case may have been so clear of other evi
dence than that stated in the proposed instruction, as that the
judge (had he seen fit) might have adopted it as a statement

CONTINENTAL IMPROVEMENT 00. V. STEAD.

167

of the ultimate facts, yet he was not bound to do so, but was
entirely justifiable in stating the law, as he did, in a more general form, namely: "It is left as a question of fact for you [the jury] to say whether
he [the plaintiff] was guilty of carelessness from the evidence. He
was required to exercise that degree of prudence, care, and caution
incumbent upon a person possessing ordinary reason and intelligence
under the special circumstances of the case, having regard to the
particular character of the crossing and the difficulty of seeing a
train approaching from the north. The fact that his hearing was
somewhat impaired would not exempt him from the necessity of
using the care required of persons in possession of their ordinary
senses or faculties. A person suffering under such an infirmity
should use more diligently his other faculties. If the place was
dangerous and the approach to it by a train obscured, he should
have proceeded with more caution and circumspection than if the
crossing were in an open country; and not ventured upon the track
without ascertaining that no train was approaching, or at least without the use of the means that common prudence would dictate to
ascertain such fact. But as this was not a regular train, or on usual
time, the same degree of caution would not be required on his part
or such as if it were a regular train and on usual time."
And further on: "It is shown by the evidence, and not disputed, that plaintiff
was accustomed to pass this crossing, and may be presumed to know
and be acquainted with the usual rate of speed with which the
trains passed this crossing, and, if this train was not moving at a
greater rate, he should be held as bound to exercise such care and
caution as to avoid collision with such trains moving at usual rates
and times; so that, unless you find that the train was moving at an
unusual and unreasonable rate of speed, you would be warranted in
finding the plaintiff was guilty of negligence which contributed to
the injury, and hence not entitled to recover."
The facts assumed in the instruction proposed depended on
the evidence, and did not by any means comprise all the facts
bearing upon the question; and, aside from the discretion which,
as we have stated, may be exercised by the judge, we think he
did quite right in this instance, after stating the law to the jury,
in submitting the evidence to their consideration.

RAILROAD CO.

v. HEOHT.

(Sup. Ct.

Another instruction asked for was as follows : "It is the duty of every one approaching with his wagon and
team along a highway to the crossing of a steam railroad to listen
and to look both ways along the railroad before going upon it. If
by reason of the character of the ground or other obstructions, or
if by reason of a defect in his sense of sight or of hearing, he cannot determine with certainty whether or not a train of cars is approaching without stopping, and, if necessary, going in advance of
his team to examine, it is his duty to do so. If in such case he goes
upon the track without taking such precaution, he does so at his
own peril, and cannot recover if injury results."
Here is no assumption of facts as in the previous instruction;
but it states the duty of persons approaching a railroad with
wagons and teams in a more absolute and unqualified form than
we think admissible. It states such duty with the rigidity of
a statute, making no allowance for modifying circumstances
or for accidental diversion of the attention, to which the most
prudent and careful are sometimes subject; and assuming, in
effect, that the duty of avoiding collision lies wholly, or nearly
so, on one side. We think that the qualified form in which
the duty of travellers, on highways in approaching a railroad
was stated by the judge in his charge, as applicable to the evidence and circumstances of this case, was all that could be justly
required by the defendants:
Judgment affirmed.

RAILROAD Co0rPA2Y v. HE HT.
1. A statute which prescribes a mode of serving process upon railroad companies
different from that provided for in a charter previously granted to a partic-

ular company, does not impair the obligation of the contract between such
company and the State.
2. The power of a State to regulate the forms of administering justice is an incident of sovereignty, and its surrender is never to be presumed.

8. As against the government, the word "shall," when used in statutes, is to be
construed as "may," unless a contrary intention is manifest.
