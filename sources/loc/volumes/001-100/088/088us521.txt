LANGDEAU V. HlANES.
Statement of the case.

LANGDEAU V. HANES.
The State of Virginia, which, prior to the Revolution, asserted title to the
Northwest Territory, always respected the possessions and titles of the
French and Canadian inhabitants who had declared themselves her citizens; and when she ceded the Territory to the United States in 1783, she
stipulated by the express terms of her grant for their confirmation ;
and the United States, in 1784, in accepting the grant with this provision, bound themselves to perform the stipulation.
The duty of the United States under the cession and acceptance and by the
principles of public law, was to give to such inhabitants such further
assurance as would enable them to enjoy undisturbed possession and to
assert their rights judicially to their property, as completely as if their
titles were derived from the United States.
The United States confirmed, or provided for the confirmation of these existing rights by resolutions and acts of Congress, in 1788, 1804, and 1807.
The patents which the act of 1807 authorized did not convey the title.
In'the legislation of Congress a patent has a double operation. It is a conveyance by the government when the government has any interest to
convey, but where it is issued upon the confirmation of a claim of a
previously existing title it is documentary evidence, having the dignity
of a record, of the existence of that title, or of such equities respecting
the claim as justify its recognition and confirmation.
A legislative confirmation of a claim to land is a recognition of the validity
of such claim, and operates as effectually as a grant or quit-claim from
the government. If the claim be to land with defined boundaries, or
capable of identification, the legislative confirmation perfects the title
to the particular tract, and a subsequent patent is only documentary
evidence of that title. If the claim be to quantity, and not to a specific
tract capable of identification, a segregation by survey will be required,
and the confirmation will then immediately attach the title to the land
segregated.

St. Vincents, and the neighboring villages, who

have professed themselves citizens of Virginia, shall have their
possessions and titles confirmed to them, and be protected in the
enjoyment of their rights and liberties."
This stipulation was embodied in the deed of cession, and
the deed, in the form in which it was subsequently executed,
was incorporated into the resolutions of Congress of 1784,
declaring their readiness to accept the deed.*
By act of March 26th, 1804,t Congress appointed commissioners to hear and determine all claims for land held by
settlers under the French ; and under this act the claim of
the heirs of one Jean Baptiste Tongas, under a grant to
their ancestor for two hundred and ibur acres, came up and
was confirmed.t The commissioners made report of the
titles which they had confirmed, and Congress, on the 3d of
March, 1807, by "An act confirmig claims to land in the District of Vincennes,"ยง enacted:
"SECTION 1. That all the decisions made by the commissioners
appointed for the purpose of examining claims of persons claiming lands in the District of Vincennes, in favor of sjuch claimants . . . be, and the same are, hereby confirmed.
"SECTION 5. That every person or the legal representative of
every person, whose claim to a tract of land is confirmed by this
act, and who had not previously obtained a patent for the same
. . . shall, whenever his claim shall have been located and surveyed,
be entitled to receive from the register of the land office at Vincennes, a certificate stating that the claimant is entitled to
receive a patent for such tract of land by virtue of this act,
which certificate shall entitle the party to a patent for the said
tract, which shall issue in like manner as provided by law for
the other lands of the United States."

A survey of the tract was made in 1820, but no patent
issued until 1872, when one issued reciting the "co firmation" by the act of 1807 of the report of the commissioners

appointed under the act of 1804. The patent purports to
"give and grant" to the heirs of Tongas, in fee, the tract
in question. The plaintiff claimed under these heirs.
The defendant claimed as tenant under one Law, who for
more than thirty years had been in the actual possession of
the premises, under claim and color of title made in good
faith, having purchased the same at a sale under a decree
of foreclosure made by the Circuit Court of Illinois for Lawrence County, and received the deed of the commissioners
appointed by the court to make the sale, and had paid all
the taxes thereon during that time.
By the law of Illinois such a pdssession coustitutes a bar
to any adverse claim.
The court held, as matter of law, under the foregoing
facts:
"1st. That the act of confirmation of 1807 was a present
grant, becoming so far operative and complete, to convey the
legal title when the land was located and surveyed by the United
States in 1820, as that an action of ejectment could be maintained on the same.
"2d. That the patent was not of itself the grant of the land
by the United States, but only the evidence that a grant had
been made to the heirs of Jean Baptiste Tongas.
"3d. That as Law went into the possession of the land under
claim and color of title made in good faith, and had held possession for more than seven successive years, and during that time
had paid all the taxes legally assessed upon the land before the
commencement of this suit, it was a bar to a recovery by the
plaintiff."
To each of these propositions of law the plantiff excepted,
and judgment having been given against him, he brought
the case here.
Messrs. John Hallum and W. B. Thompson, for the plaintiff
in error:
The question is, did the confirmatory act of 1807 pass the
equitable title to the confirmee, or did it pass a legal title to
the fee? The court below held that it passed the latter. Now

we assert that the legal title remained in the United States
until the patent issued for the land. If this is so the statute
of limitations prescribed by Illinois is no bar.
The cases of Bagnell v. Broderiek,* Fenn v. Holme,t Gibson
v. Choulean,T control the case. The last is in point. This
court there held that the power of Congress in the disposal
of the public domain cannot be interfered with or its exercise embarrassed by any State legislation; that such hostile
legislation cannot deprive the grantees of the United States
of the possession and enjoyment of the property by reason
of any delay in the transfer of the title after the initiation
of proceedings for its acquisition from the United States.
That the patent is the instrument which under the laws
of Congress passes the title of the United States; that in the
action of ejectment in the Federal courts for lands derived
from the United States, the patent, when regular on its face,
is conclusive evidence of title in the patentee.
That in actions of ejeetment in the State courts, when
the question presented is, whether the plaintiff or defendant
has the superior title from the United States, the patent is
conclusive.
That the occupation of lands derived from the United
States before the issue of their patent, for the period prescribed by the statute of limitations of a State for the commencement of actions for the recovery of real property, is
not a bar to an action of ejeetment for the recovery of such
lands founded on the legal title subsequently conveyed by
the patent.
That such occupation does not constitute a sufficient equity
in favor of the occupant to control the legal title thus subsequently conveyed, whether asserted in a separate suit in a
Federal court, or set up as an equitable defence to an action
of ejeetment in a State court.

not apply. There the land in dispute was a tract selected by
certain parties in lieu of land damaged by earthquakes at
New Madrid in the year 1812, in which way the lands held
by early inhabitants of New Madrid were in that year materially injured. Congress, in 1815, by way of relief, allowed
them or their assigns to locate an equal quantity of land
to that injured, on the domain of the United States, and it was
such a relocation or new location of land near St. Louis,
which was in controversy in that case. Of course the title
or legal estate to the land thus located in place of that injured was solely in the United States, and from them alone
could any title be derived, and until the conditions under
which the relocation was to be made were complied with,
the United States retained the title. It was accordingly
held that as against the title conveyed by their subsequent
patent, the statute of limitations of Missouri could only begin
to run after the patent was issued,-not previously, that is,
whilst the United States held it, which would seem to be
obvious enough.
In the present case neither Virginia nor the United States
ever owned the land in controversy, or pretended to own it.
'The act of cession and all the acts of Congress are acts of
confirmation of a previously existing claim and right. Besides, if this were otherwise, and the claim of the heirs of
Tongas were a mere equitable title, the legislative confirmation by the act of 1807 operated as a grant or quit-claim of
the government, perfecting the claimant's title; and the
statute of Illinois would begin to run against them after the
title was thus perfected. Had there been a legislative confirmation of the claim under the New Madrid location, in
Gibson v. Chouteau, there would have been no occasion for
the patent of the United States ta perfect the claimant's title.
The statute of limitations would have commenced running,
in that event, from the date of the confirmation.

was claimed by Virginia previous to 1776 to be within her
chartered limits, it was not reduced to her possession until
the war of the Revolution. Previous to that period nunerous settlements had been fbrmed within that portion which
at present comprises the States of Indiana and Illinois, con:
sisting principally of French inhabitants from Canada, who
held the lands they occupied under concessions from French
and English authorities. The possessions and titles of these
people were respected by Virginia, and in her cession of the
territory to the United States she expressly stipulated for
their confirmation. The act of her legislature, passed on
the 20th of October, 1788, authorized her delegates in Congress to execute a deed transferring her right, title, and
claim, as well of soil as of jurisdiction, to the territory, provided that the transfer should be subject to various conditions, and, among others, to this one: "That the French
and Canadian inhabitants and other settlers of the Kaskaskias, St. Vincents, and the neighboring villages, who have
professed themselves citizens of Virginia, shall have their
possessions and titles confirmed to them, and be protected
in the enjoyment of their rights and liberties." The dee&
executed by the delegates embodied the act of Virginia, and
its acceptance by the United States imposed upon them the
duty of performing the condition and giving the protection
stipulated. That duty was to confirm the possessions and
titles of the inhabitants, and to confirm was to give to them
such further assurance as would enable them to enjoy undisturbed their possessions, and assert their right to their
property in the courts of the country as fully and completely
as if their titles were derived directly from the United States.
Such further assurance might have been given by any act
of the new government recognizing the existence of the original possession and defining its limits, which the claimants
could use as evidence of their title under the cession. It
might have been by a certificate of survey, or by a patent
of the government, or by direct legislation. The mode in
which the obligation assumed by the United States should be
discharged was a matter resting in the discretion of Congress.

Oct. 1874.]

LANGDEAU V. HANES.
Opinion of the court.

It was for confirmation of existing possessions and titles
that the deed of cession stipulated, not the transfer of any
new title. Virginia had not repudiated the concessions
made by the French and English authorities to the inhabitants in the territory who had declared themselves her citizens, but had recognized and sustained them. There was,
therefore, no title in her in the lands covered by the possessions of these people to transfer, and she did not undertake
to transfer any. Her language was, that she conveyed "all
right, title, and claim, as well of soil as of jurisdiction," which
the commonwealth had to the territory.' In this respect she
recognized the general rule of public law, that by the cession of territory from one state to another public property
and sovereignty alone pass, and that private property is not
affected. Even in cases of conquest, as Mr. Chief Justice
Marshall observes in United States v. Percheman,*it is unusual
for the conqueror to do more than to displace the sovereign
and assume dominion over the country, and the sense of
justice and right, which is felt by the whole civilized world,
would be outraged if private property should be generally
'confiscated and private rights annulled. "The people,"
continues the Chief Justice, "change their allegiance; their
relation to their ancient sovereign is dissolved, but their relations to each other and their rights of property remain
undisturbed. If this be the modern rule, even in cases of
conquest, who can doubt its application to the case of an
amicable cession of territory? Had Florida changed its
sovereign by an act containing no stipulation respecting the
property of individuals, the, right of property in all those
who became subjects or citizens of the new government
would have been unaffected by the change. It would have
remained the same as under the ancient sovereign."
The United States took, therefore, the territory ceded by
Virginia, bound by the established principles of public law
to respect and protect all private rights of property of the
inhabitants of the country, and bound by express stipulation

Opinion of the court.

to confirm the possessions and titles of the French and Canadian inhabitants and other settlers mentioned in the deed
of cession who had professed themselves citizens of Virginia.
By resolutions passed by Congress under the Confederation, in June and August, 1788, measures were authorized
for the confirmation of these possessions and titles, and
in supposed compliance with the authority conferred upon
the governor of the Territory, numerous confirmations were
made by him, which have been sometimes designated in the
subsequent legislation of Congress as grants by that officer.*
But no system of measures was adopted for a general confirmation until the passage of the act of Congress of March
26th, 1804.t
By that act every person claiming lands within certain
designated limits in the territory north of the Ohio and east
of the Mississippi, by virtue of a legal grant made by the
French government prior to the treaty of Paris of the 10th
of February, 1763, or by the British government subsequent
to that period, and prior to the treaty of peace between the
United States and Great Britain, on the 3d of September,
1783, or by virtue of any resolution or act of Congress subsequent to that treaty, was required to deliver, on or before
the 1st of January, 1805, to the register of the land office of
the district within which the land was situated, a notice
stating the nature and extent of his claim, together with a
plat of the tract or tracts claimed, and at the same time, for
the purpose of being recorded, "every grant, order of survey, deed, conveyance, or other written evidence of his
claim." And the register of the land office and the receiver
of public moneys were constituted commissioners within
their respective districts for the purpose of examining the
claims thus presented. It was made their duty to hear in a
summary manner all matters respecting such claims, to examine witnesses and such testimony as might be adduced

before them and to decide thereon "according to justice and
equity;" and to transmit to the Secretary of the Treasury a
transcript of their decisions made in favor of the claimants,
and a report of the claims rejected, with a substance of the
evidence adduced in their support. This transcript of decisions and the report, the secretary was required to lay
before Congress at its next ensuing session.
Among the claims presented under this act was one on
behalf of the heirs of Jean Baptiste Tongas for two hundred
and four acres, situated in the neighborhood of Vincennes,
a place which is designated in the cession from Virginia as
St.Vincents, such claim being founded upon an ancient grant
to their ancestor. The commissioners decided in favor of
the heirs and confirmed their claim, and transmitted a transcript of their decision to the Secretary of the Treasury, by
whom it was laid before Congress.
By the act of March 3d, 1807,* this decision, and all other
decisions in favor of persons claiming lands in the district
of Vincennes, contained in the transcript transmitted to the
Secretary of the Treasury, were confirmed. This confirmation was the fulfilment of the condition stipulated in the
deed of cession so far as the claimants were concerned. It
was an authoritative recognition by record of the ancient
possession and title of their ancestor, and gave to them such
assurance of the validity of that possession and title as would
be always respected by the courts of the country. The subsequent clause of the act providing for the issue of a patent
to the claimants, when their claim was located and su-rveyed,
took nothing from the force of the confirmation.
In the legislation of Congress a patent has a double operation. It is a conveyance by the government when the government has any interest to convey, but where it is issued
upon the confirmation of a claim of a previously existing
title it is documentary evidence, having the dignity of a
record, of the existence of that title, or of such equities respecting the claim as justify its recognition and confirmation.

[Sup. Ct

Opinion of the court.

The instrument is not the less efficacious as evidence of previously existing rights because it also embodies words of release or transfer from the government.
In the present case the patent would have been of great
value to the claimants as record evidence of the ancient possession and title of their ancestor and of the recognition and
confirmation by the United States, and would have obviated
in any controversies at law respecting the land the necessity
of other proof, and would thus have been to them an instrument of quiet and security. But it would have added nothing to the force of the confirmation. The survey required
for the patent was only to secure certainty of description in
the instrument, and to inform the government of the quantity reserved to private parties from the domain ceded by
Virginia.
The whole error of the plaintiff arises from his theory that
the fee to the land in controversy passed to the United
States by the cession from Virginia, and that a patent was
essential to its transfer to the claimants, whereas, with respect to the lands covered by the possessions of the inhabitants and settlers mentioned in the deed of cession,
the fee never passed to the United States; and if it had
passed, and a mere equitable title had remained in the claimants after the cession, the confirmation by the act of 1807
would have operated as a release to them of the interest of
the United States. A legislative confirmation of a claim to
land is a recognition of the validity of such claim, and operates as .effectually as a grant or quit-claim from the government. "A confirmation," says Sheppard in his Touchstone
of Common Assurances, "is the conveyance of an estate, or
right, that one hath in or unto lands or tenements, to another
that hath the possession thereof, or some estate therein,
whereby a voidable estate is made sure and unavoidable, or
whereby a particular estate is increased and enlarged."* If
the claim be to land with defined boundaries, or capable of
identification, the legislative confirmation perfects the title
* Page 311.

Oct 1874.]

LANGDEAU V. HANES.
Opinion of the court.

to the particular tract, and a subsequent patent is only documentary evidence of that title. If the claim be to quantity,
and not to a specific tract capable of identification, a segregation by survey will be required, and the confirmation will
then immediately attach the title to the land segregated.
We do not understand that the ancient grant to Tongas
was only of quantity, but understand that it was of a specific
tract of two hundred and four acres, and that the decision
of the commissioners in favor of the claimants had reference
to a defined tract. If such were the fact the title of the heirs
was perfected, assuming that previously they had only an
equitable interest, upon the passage of the confirmatory act
of 1807; if, however, the grant was of a certain quantity of
land then undefined and incapable of identification, the title
became perfect when the quantity was segregated by the
survey made in 1820.*
The plaintiff can, therefore, derive no aid from the patent
issued in 1872. The doctrine which his counsel invokes,
that the legislation of a State cannot defeat or impair the
rights conferred by a patent of the United States in advance
of its issue, is sound when properly applied, but it has no
application here. There is no analogy between this case
and the case of Gibson v. Chouleau,t and other cases cited by
him. Here, in any view that may be taken, the title was
perfected in the heirs of Tongas more than half a century
before the patent issued, and for more than thirty years of
that period the landlord of the defendant has been in the
actual possession of the premises under claim and color of
title made in good faith, and has during that time paid all
the taxes legally assessed thereon. His possession has, therefore, ripened into a title, which, under the statute of Illinois,

is a bar to any adverse claim.
