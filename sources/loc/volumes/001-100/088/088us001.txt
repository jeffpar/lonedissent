DECISIONS
IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
OCTOBER TERN, 1874.

Tim

LADY PIKE.

1. Though on appeals in admiralty, involving issues of fact alone, this court
will not, except in a clear case, reverse where both the District and the
Circuit Court have agreed in their conclusions, yet in a clear case it will
reverse even in such circumstances.
2. The master of a steamer which undertakes to tow boats up and down a
river where piers of bridges impede the navigation, is bound to know
the width of his steamers and their tows, and whether, when lashed together, he can run them safely between piers through which he attempts
to pass. Ile is bound also, if it is necessary for his safe navigation in
the places where he chooses to be, to know how the currents set about
the piers in different heights of the water, and to know whether, at
high water, his steamers and their tows will safely pass over an obstruction which, in low water, they could not pass over.
2. The owners of steamers undertaking to tow vessels are responsible for
accidents, the result of want of proper knowledge, on the part of their
captains, of the difficulties of navigation in the river in whibh the
steamers ply.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the Eastern District
of Wisconsin.
The Germania Insurance Company had insured a cargo
of wheat, laden on a barge at Shockopee, on the Minnesota
River, and about to be towed by the steamer Lady Pike
down that river to its junction with the Mississippi, thence
down the Mississippi to Savannah, Illinois; "unavoidable dangers of the river... only excepted."
The cargo was laden on the barge, and the transportation

of it begun. In the course of the voyage, however, the
barge was wrecked. The insurance company paid the loss,
and alleging that the barge had been wrecked- owing to the
negligent manner in which the steamer had towed her, filed
a libel against the steamer to recover what had been paid
for the loss. The owners of the steamer set up that the
wrecking had been caused by an "unavoidable danger of
the river," and was, therefore, within the dangers from which
they had excepted themselves. And whether the catastrophe was caused by an " unavoidable danger of the river,"
or by the steamer's negligence, was the question.
The case was thus:
In April, 1866, there stood in the Mississippi River, just
above St. Paul's, certain piers of a bridge then in process of
construction, beginning on the west side of the river and
numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5; pier No. 3 (a turn-table pier)
being so far unfinished as that when the river was high, barges
like that on which this wheat was laden could pass in safety
over it; though when the water was low they could not. In
low water the pier was exposed. Owing to a gravel point
on the west side of the river which projected itself a little
way into the stream, and against which the water struck,
the current, in high water especially, rebounded and ran
diagonally across the piers towards the east shore, so that
"'
a boat in going between piers No. 3 and No. 4 would drift
from four to six feet towards pier No. 4." Hills bounded
each side of the river for many miles along its course, with
occasional openings, or "coolies"
as the navigators call
them, through which winds blow, that at other places on the
river are arrested by the hills. One of the openings or
coolies existed on the west side of the river opposite to these
piers. The space between piers No. 3 and No. 4 when No.
3 was above the water, was about 116 feet; that between
No. 2 and No. 4 (when No. 3 was below the water) was 264
feet; that between No. 4 and No. 5 was 151 feet. The main
part of the channel was between No. 3 and No. 4; there
was the draw of the bridge, and it was between those piers
that boats and tows going down the river, and sufficiently

narrow to pass through in safety, usually went. The passage
between No.4 and No.5 was at one time obstructed by a
sunken barge, but this was after the time of the transit now
under consideration. That passage-the passage between
NSo. 4 and No. 5-at this time was clear and of sufficient depth
for the Lady Pike and her tow to have passed in safety.
In this state of things, it was-the rivers Minnesota and
Mississippi being at the time full with the spring watersthat the Lady Pike, a stern-wheel steamer, "a high boat,
which would catch a good deal of wind on her sides," set off
from her moorings with three barges in tow, laden with six
hundred tons of wheat; a tow which was to be styled a
heavy tow. One barge, larger than the other two, was lashed
on one side, and the remaining two upon the other.
The width of all the vessels, steamer and barges when
close alongside each other, was 105 feet. They were all
stanch, and the steamer abundantly provided with men,
including two master mariners and two pilots. Scudding
clouds prevented the day from being absolutely clear, and
"puffs, gusts, or squalls of wind," came up from time to
time. These had "bothered" the pilot nowhere, however,
in a way worth mentioning, and the vessels had had no
trouble except a little in going between the piers of another
bridge higher up the stream, between which, however, they
had got safely.
On approaching the piers just above St. Paul, of which
we are now principally speaking-the vessels being under a
headway of about seven miles an hour-no squall then blowing, and no "slow-bell" having been sounded, the pilot of
the steamer, judging by his eye, and thus judging, being
under the impression that he could do so safely, attempted
to run his steamer and its tow between piers No. 3 and No.
4. He was apparently ignorant of the exact width of his
steamer and its tow, ignorant also of the exact distance between the two piers, and ignorant besides of the fact that
in the then height of the water he could have run over pier
No. 3; and ignorant in addition or not appreciative of the
diagonal effect of the current as it set in high water be-

tween the piers. Tho result was that one of the barges
struck pier No. 4, and was wrecked.
The captain and other officers of the steamer swore that

just as they were going through the piers, a squall arose and
drove the barge against the pier; that the accident arose
through no negligence, and was an unavoidable danger of
the river.
The District Court held that this was the true view of the
case, and dismissed the libel. The Circuit Court affirmed
the decree, and the case was now brought here by the insurance company for review.

Messrs. J. M. Carlisle and J. D. McPherson, for the appellants:

1. If the catastrophe did arise from a squall just as the craft
was passing between the piers No. 3 and No. 4, still the decrees
below were clearly wrong. The master had no business to be
between piers No. 3 and No. 4 at all; and he was there only
because he was ignorant of certain capital matters which he
was bound to know, and a knowledge of which, had he possessed such knowledge, would have certainly taken him
elsewhere than between those piers, and have prevented his
being there, and so have prevented the catastrophe which
occurred. We mean to say that he did not know the width
of his craft, the width of the strait through which he was
about to carry it; the fact that he need not, in the then
high state of the river, have attempted to run between pier
No. 3 and pier No. 4 at all, but might have sailed right over
pier No. 3, and so, for his craft of 105 feet wide, have had a
passage 264 feet wide; a width absolutely safe. He was
ignorant also of the fact that a current would affect him,
and in his effort to run his craft of 105 feet wide through a
space of 116 feet would of itself alone carry him six feet out
of his course. Moreover, the captain was bound to .know
that wind might meet him (if any did meet him) at the
"cooly" opposite the piers, and to be prepared for it. If
there was a squall it doubtless came through the "cooly."

2. Had it been necessary to run between piers No. 3 and No. 4

TnE LADY PIKE.
Argument for the owners of the steamer.

the speed was too great. The captain should have gone under a
very slow bell. The space between the piers being just wide
enough to get th.rougb, the craft could, of course, pass in
some way. Had he been going very slowly, the barge might
have grazed, rubbed, been strained, but she might not have
been wrecked. In case of touching the pier her chances
would have been infinitely better when going slowly, than
when dashing ahead at the rate of seven miles an hour. We
simply put this point, asserting however, broadly, generally, and as our principal point, that the vessels should not
have been in such a Dardanelles at all, where a puff of wind
could wreck them, and would not have been there but for
the ignorance of the captain of matters which it was his
high duty to be acquainted with.
3. The accident was not caused by wind. Admitting that the
wind might have risen at the very and exact instant of time
that the craft was going through the piers-a singular coincidence, it may be safely said, and one requiring the fullest
proof-yet no one pretends that it was a great wind, a hurricane. Yet the laws of physics show that nothing short of
a great wind, a hurricane, and this too rising in an instant,
could have produced this catastrophe.
[The learned counsel then went into a calculation in
physics, taking what they assumed that the evidence showed
as to the weight of the cargo, the weight of the boats, the
surface which they exposed to the wind, the depth to which
they were in the water, the fact that the steamer had not
careened, and the place in the barge which was opened, and
the part of the pier at which she struck, to show that it was
impossible that anything short of a hurricane could have
driven the steamer and her tows sufficiently far, during the
time that she was between the piers before the catastrophe
occurred, to have made the collision. This part of the argument they pressed with great apparent confidence.]

Court and one in the Circuit Court on appeal-and upon
both hearings the case having been decided against the
libellants upon the merits, this court will not reverse the decree below, except upon a very clear case made. This is
the well-settled practice of the courts of the United States
and of this court.*
1. The loss was caused by the act of God; a sudden gust
of wind, and there was no want of care and skill. This
point is made out in the proof.
The passage taken was the main channel. It was under
the draw; presumptively, therefore, the very and exact right
place through which to pass.
The case of Andes v. Sterens,t given to us by the old but
good reporter Sir John Strange, is in point. Strange thus
reports it:

"The plaintiff puts goods on board the defendant's hoy, who
was a common carrier. Coming through bridge, by a sudden
gust of wind, the hoy sunk, and the goods were spoiled. The
plaintiff insisted .that the defendant should be liable, it being his
carelessness in going through at-such a time; and offered some
evidence, that if the hoy had been in good order, it would not
have sunk with the stroke it received, and from thence inferred
the defendant answerable for all accidents, which would not
have happened to the goods in case they had been put into 9
better hoy. But the C.J. held the defendant not answerable,
the damage being occasioned by the act of God. For though
the defendant ought not to have ventured to shoot the bridge,
if the general bent of the weather had been tempestuous; yet
this being only a sudden gust of wind, had entirely differed the
case, and no carrier is obliged to have a new carriage for every
journey; it is sufficient if he provides one which, without any
extraordinary accident (such as this was), will probably perform
the journey."
Other cases are to the same effect.1

THE LADY PIKE.
Reply.

If a navigator was to desist proceeding on his voyage because there was a possibility of an injury, he would never
do anything. There is the possibility, perhaps even more,
of the loss of a ship every time she crosses the ocean, yet,
if fair nautical judgment is used, and a loss happens by an act
of God, or a peril of the sea, it is held to be inevitable, and
the carrier is excused. :He must use his judgment. He is
not bound to have the highest nautical skill in the world or
a better judgment than all other people, any more than he
is bound to have the best vessel in existence.
The day was fair, and there was no appearance of wind at
the time they approached the piers, and the barges having
no means by which they could have been floated down between the piers, and being towed in the usual manner through
a place that must be passed, clearly there was no want of
that care or foresight in not anticipating and guarding against
this gust of wind.
2. Want of care in the speed of the Lady Pike as she approached the piers is alleged. Clear proof would be required
that all the officers on watch had neglected anything in relation to passing these piers. They knew their boat and how
the tow handled, and how best to pass the piers. Probably
with a stern-propeller where a course is rightly taken, the
highest speed-that which shoots right through-is the
safest; manceuvring in such places with stern-wheeled vessels is difficult.
8. The opposing counsel endeavor to bring certain mathematical problems to bear upon this question. The- trouble
with all such calculations is that they have no certain bases
to rest upon. The calculation and rule are not admitted to
be correct, but if the rule applied were so, of what use would
it be without certain data? There is nothing in the case so
definite and well defined that will enable us to apply the
rules of mathematics to it. All is speculation upon uncertainties and is only made plausible by assuming things not
proved and not true.
R eply: We fully admit the position of the other side-

one which we long ago contended for in this court*-that
this court will not reverse on questions of fact where the
District and Circuit Courts have concurred, except in a clear
case. And it is because this case is clear, and only because
it is so, that we ask a reversal.
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Appeals in admiralty, it may be admitted, are not favored
where it appears that the subordinate courts have both concurred in the same view of the merits of the controversy;
but it is not accurate to say that the Supreme Court will not
reverse such a decree in a clear case.
Such a proposition cannot be adopted, as a rule of decision, consistently with the provisions in the act of Congress allowing appeals from final decrees rendered in the
Circuit Court to the Supreme Court, in all cases of equity
and of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, where the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds the sum or value
of two thousand dollars.
Decrees of the kind were formerly required to be removed
here for re-examination by a writ of error, but the Congress
subsequently repealed those regulations, and provided that
appeals should be allowed in all such cases, and that upon
such appeal a transcript of the libel, bill, answer, depositions,
and all other proceedings of what kind soever in the case,
shall be transmitted to the said Supreme Court. Provision
is also made by that act that new evidence may be received
here on the hearing of such appeals in admiralty and prize
cases, which affords very strong support to the proposition
that the facts, as well as the law of the case, are open to
revision by this court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.
Considerable weight undoubtedly in such a case should
be given to the decree of the subordinate court, and hence
the rule, which is well settled, that the burden is on the appellant to show that the decree of the subordinate court is

erroneous, but it is a mistake to suppose that this court will
not re-examine the facts as well as the law of the case, as
the express command of the act of Congress is that the
Supreme Court shall "bear and determine such appeals,"
which makes it as much the plain duty of this court to reexamine the evidence in the case as the questions of law
presented for decision.*
Wheat of the quantity and quality specified in the libel
was delivered by the shipper to the master of the steamer at
the place mentioned in the libel, to be transported from the
port of shipment to the port of Savannah, in the State of
Illinois. Such a shipment it was not expected would be
laden on board the steamer, as she was not constructed nor
fitted for the stowage of grain in bulk, nor was it in the contemplation of either party that the wheat would be shipped
and transported to the port of destination in that way, as
the shipper as well as the carriers knew that such freight
was accustomed to be stowed in bulk in barges belonging
to the carriers, and that the respondent steamer was employed in towing barges so laden with such cargoes.
Pursuant to that usage the wheat in question was stowed
in bulk on board the barge described in the libel, and the
barge, with two others of like character, similarly laden,
was taken in tow by the steamer, which furhished the motive power for the whole craft, and the proofs show that the
several barges, as well as the steamer, were commanded by
the same master and manned by the same crew. They, the
steamer and barges, were all arranged. abreast, the larger
barge being lashed to the starboard side of the steamer, and
the smaller of the other two being lashed to the port side
of the steamer, between-the steamer and the starboard side
of the barge containing the wheat which is the subject of
litigation.
Diferent estimates are made by the witnesses as to the
width of the whole craft as arranged, but the evidence taken
as a whole convinces the court that the steamer and the

Opinion of the court.

three barges combined, including the guards of the steamer
and the planking of the barges, could not have been less
than one hundred and five feet, even if they were all closely
lashed together, which is highly improbable. Lashed as
they were, broadside to broadside, of course the stem of the
steamer was much in advance of some or all of the respective
stems of the barges, as she exceeded in length, even the
largest barge, more than fifty feet. Barges for transporting
such products were furnished by the carriers, but the wheat
was put on board the barge by the shipper, it being the duty
of the carrier to have agents present to oversee and regulate
the stowage.
Sufficient appears in the pleadings and proofs to support
the proposition that the wheat, when stowed in the barge
and delivered to the master, was in good order and condition,
and that the master, when he received the wheat, contracted
with the shipper to transport and deliver the same, in like
good order and condition, to the consignees at the port of
destination, as when received at the port of loading, "the
unavoidable dangers of the river and fire only excepted,"
and the libellants allege that the master did not so transport
and deliver the wheat to the said consignees, although no
dangers of the river or fire prevented him from so doing.
Instead of that, the libellants charge that he, the master,
and his mariners and servants, so negligently and carelessly
conducted themselves in the navigation of the steamer and
barges that the barge containing the wheat was sunk in the
river, and that the wheat became and was a total loss.
Process was served and the claimants appeared and filed
an answer, in which they admit the shipment of the wheat
and the contract of the master to transport and deliver the
same, as alleged in the libel, but they allege that the sinking of the barge and the consequent loss of the wheat were
occasioned by the unavoidable dangers of the river, and they
deny that the sinking of the barge was caused by any negligence or carelessness on their part or on the part of those
navigating the steamer or barge which contained the wheat;
and they also allege that when passing in the usual channel

Opinion of the court.

between the piers in the river, near St. Paul, in the usual
way, the steamer and barge were by a sudden gust of wind
blown to the larboard, so that the barge containing the wheat
struck the pier on that side of the barge, which caused the
barge to sink, as alleged in the libel. Proofs were taken
and the District Court, after hearing the parties, entered a
decree dismissing the libel. Hearing was again had in the
Circuit Court on appeal, and the Circuit Court entered a
decree affirming the decree of the District Court. Whereupon the libellants appealed to this court.
Errors assigned here are in substance and effect as follows:
1. That the steamer and barge were not properly manned,
nor were they fit for the voyage, as neither the master nor
pilots had either the requisite knowledge of the vessels under
their command or of the dangers and difficulties of the navigation which they had to meet in the course of the trip
down the river.
2. That the pilot improperly endeavored to steer the craft
midway between piers Nos. a and 4 when he ought to have
known that the latter pier was so far under water that the
craft might have safely passed over it, as was usually done
in times of high water, by which improper and unnecessary
act the barge containing the wheat was brought within five
and a half or six feet of the pier which she struck, whereas
if the pilot had steered the craft farther to the westward and
passed over that pier, as he should have done at that stage
of the water, the distance to the piers on either side of the
craft would have been so great as to have avoided all danger
of collision.
3. That the craft might have been navigated in safety between piers Nos. 4 and 5, which are one hundred and fiftyone feet apart, showing that the craft might have been navigated through that pass, leaving a space on either side of
twenty-three feet, which is manifestly too great to have been
overcome by the alleged gust of wind.
4. That the speed of the steamer with the barges in tow,
in passing between the piers, was improper and unwarrantable, and was the efficient cause of the disaster and loss.

THE LADY PIKE.

[Sup. Ot

Opinion of the court.

5. That it was the course of the current, which was unknown to the pilot, that drove the craft to the leeward, and
not the wind, as alleged in the answer, and the libellants
allege that the pilot, if he had had proper knowledge of the
navigation, might have prevented that movement of the
craft by the exercise of due skill in steering.
1. Applied exclusively to the number of the steamer's
company, the complaint contained in the first assignment of
errors would not be well founded, as the crew was sufficient
in number, and the proofs show that the steamer had on
board two pilots and two master mariners, but the gravamen
of the complaint is that neither the master in charge of the
deck nor the pilot had any sufficient knowlege of the craft
under their command, nor of the dangers of the navigation
in passing down the river in such a steamer with three such
barges in tow arranged in the manner before described.
Proof of the most satisfactory character is exhibited that
they did not even know the width of the craft, as the same
was arranged, nor the actual distance between the piers
where lhe disaster occurred. On the contrary it appears
that they both over-estimated the width of the space between
the piers, and under-estimated the width of the tow, including the steamer, as they were arranged abreast, the distance
between the two first-named piers not exceeding one hundred and sixteen feet and the width of the whole craft being
at least one hundred and five feet. Nor does the fact that
the pier on the starboard side was so far under water that
the craft might have passed over it palliate the rashness of
the act, as the evidence shows that both the master and the
pilot were ignorant of that fact, and that as they approached
the place of danger they put the steamer upon a course to
cause the whole craft to pass midway between those two
piers, which brought the port side of the barge containing
the wheat within five and a half or six feet of the pier on
that side which was not submerged in the water.
2. Attempt is made to excuse the master and pilot for
endeavoring to pass midway between those piers, upon the
ground that they did not know that it would be safe to pass

Oct. 1874.]

TjiE

LADY PIKE.

Opinion of the court.

over the pier on the starboard side, but the sufficiency of
that excuse cannot be admitted, for two reasons: (1.) Because they *oughtto have known both the dangers and the
facilities of navigation before undertaking the responsible
duties in which they were engaged. (2.) Because it was
their duty, if they believed that the pass in question was restricted to the distance between the two piers, to have taken
the other pass, which the evidence shows has the width of
one hundred and fifty-one feet.
Opposed to that is the suggestion that the wider passage
was obstructed by a sunken barge, but the evidence satisfies
the court that the alleged obstruction did not exist at that
time, and that the disaster that caused that barge to sink
occurred at a later period.
3. Unobstructed as the wider passage was, it was plainly
a rash act to attempt to pass down the narrower passage on
a course which brought the port side of the barge containing the wheat within five and a half or six feet of the pier
on that side, which act can only be accounted for upon the
ground of negligence and inexcusable ignorance of the dangers and facilities of the navigation, as it was evidently a
hazardous experiment to attempt to pass between those piers
if the craft could not pass over the pier on the starboard
side, and it is equally clear that it would have been safe to
have steered between the piers forming the wider passage,
which it seems never occurred to the master or pilot.
4. Even if such an attempt could be justified at all on a
windy day when the water was high, it is quite clear that
neither skill nor good judgment was exercised in setting the
course of the craft before passipg between the piers. Beyond all doubt some allowance, though the margin was
small, should have been made for the leeway of the craft, as
the evidence is convincing that the course of the current at
high water tends somewhat to force the craft towards the
pier on the port side. Besides they had met with some difficulty previously during the trip that day,-at the bridge higher
up the river, and, therefore, were forewarned that a like
difficulty might again occur.

THE LADY PIKE.

[Sup. Ct

Opinion of the court.

Ignorance of the danger before them is no sufficient excuse, as the'owner appoints the master and is bound to select
one of competent skill and knowledge, to transport goods
and merchandise shipped on board in safety, which necessarily imposes the obligation to employ a master mariner who
knows enough about the route to avoid the known obstructions and to choose the most feasible track for his route.
Knowledge of the kind, in river navigation, is peculiarly
essential, as the current frequently shifts from one side towards the other, and the track of navigation is often obstructed by snags, sand-bars, and shoals, which no degree
of skill would enable the mariner or pilot to avoid without
a prior knowledge of their existence.
Cross-currents between the piers of bridges which span
the river somewhat diagonally are not infrequent, and as
they are not always fully appreciable to the casual observer,
it is important that master mariners should know of their
existence and something of their force, in order that they
may be able to steer their steamer or othe r vessel properly
through such a passage. Neither the master nor pilot, in this
case, knew that there was any such cross-current between
these piers, and consequently took no precaution to guard
against its influence.
Carriers of merchandise by water, seeking general employment, are to be regarded as common carriers, and like
common carriers by land, in the absence of any legislative
provision prescribing a different rule, are in general to be
held responsible as insurers, and consequently are liable in
all events and for every loss or damage to the merchandise,
unless it happened by the act of God, the public enemy, or
by the act of the shipper, or by some other cause or accident,
without any fault or negligence on their part, as expressly
excepted in the bill of lading or contract of shipment.
Standard authorities show that the first duty of the carrier, and one that is implied by law, is to provide a seaworthy
vessel, well furnished with proper motive power, and furniture necessary for the voyage. Necessary equipment is as
requisite as that the hull of the vessel should be stanch and

strong, and she must also be provided with a crew adequate
in number and competent for their duty with reference to
all the exigencies of the intended route, and, with a competent and skilful master, of sound judgment and discretion,
and with sufficient kpowledge of the route and experience
in navigation to be able to perform in a proper manner all
the ordinary duties required of him as master of the vessel.
Owners of vessels, employed as such carriers, must see to
it that the master is qualified for his situation, as they are
responsible for his want of skill and knowledge in that behalf and for his negligence and bad seamanship. In the
absence of any special agreement to the contrary or exception in the bill of lading or contract of shipment, his duty
extends to all that relates to the loading as well as the safekeeping, due transportation, and right delivery of the goods,
and for the faithful performance of all those duties the ship
is liable as well as the master and owners.*
5. Differences of opinion may arise as to the merits of the
fourth assignment of errors, and inasmuch as enough is
alleged in those which precede and follow it to show that
the decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed, the court
here does not find it necessary to determine the question
whether the speed of the steamer, in view of the conflicting

testimony upon the subject, was or was not greater than the
exigencies of the impending peril would justify.
6. Nor is it necessary to express any decided opinion
whether the fifth assignment of error is or is not supported
by the evidence exhibited in the case, but it is deemed proper
to say that there is much reason to conclude that it was the
course of the current that forced the craft to the leeward,
and not the gust of wind, as was supposed by those in charge
of the deck of the steamer at the time the barge was sunk.
Enough appears to show that the bridge there does not
span the river directly across the current, and that the ten* Abbott on Shipping, 344; Laveroni v. Drury, 8 Exchequer, 166; Clark

river to the leeward, and the evidence is full to the point
that neither the master nor the pilot had any knowledge
that they would have to encounter any such difficulty in attempting to effect the passage between those piers. Support
to that proposition is found in the fact that they did not
think it necessary to adopt any precaution to prevent such a
disaster, except to see that the craft headed midway between
the piers of the narrow passage and to give the steamer a
full head of steam, so as to make the passage as quick as
possible, which shows beyond all.doubt that little or no use
could be made of the helm during the passage, except to
steady the craft on the course adopted just before they entered the passage between the piers where the disaster
occurred.
Reliable means to ascertain with certainty what force it
was which caused the craft to make leeway during the pas
sage is not exhibited in the record, nor is it necessary to
decide that point, as it was plainly a rash act to undeitake
to steer the craft through that passage on a windy day
when the banks of the river were full, in the face of the
dangers which the evidence satisfies the court would necessarily be encountered in such an attempt. Nfeither the state
of the water nor of the wind was such as to furnish any just
excuse for the master or pilot, as they might have chosen
the other passage or have taken proper and seasonable measures to leave back one of the barges for the next trip.
Shipowners are responsible for such a disaster if it results
from the ignorance, unskilfulness, or negligence of the master or those in charge of the vessel. Where the master,
being ignorant of the coast, sailed past the port to which he
was destined and ran into another port in the possession of
the enemy and was captured, the Court of King's Bench
unanimously decided that the implied warranty to provide a
master of competent skill was broken by sending out one
who was unable to distinguish between the two ports.*
