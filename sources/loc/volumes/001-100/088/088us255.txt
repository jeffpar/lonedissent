of the assignee, and that, therefore, those stockholders only
were liable who were such at the date of the execution.
This is the full force of the decisions referred to, and they
give to the plaintiff the right to seek his remedy against any
one who held-stock subject to the incident of individual liability, at the date of the execution against the corporation.
But as the incident of individual liability has been repealed, and neither .the law nor his contract makes the defendant liable for the debts of the company beyond the
amount of its stock, it follows that the decisions of the Supreme Court of Missouri on the point invoked are not applicable.
And so, doubtless, thought that court in its decision of
this case, as the point is not noticed in the opinion.
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

RAILROAD COMPANY V. SMITH ET AL.
1. The law does not require a party to pay for imperfect and defective work
the price stipulated for a perfect structure; and when that price is demanded, will allow him to deduct the difference between that price and
the value of the inferior work, and also the amount of any direct damages flowing from existing defects, not exceeding the demand of the
plaintiffs. The deduction is allowed in a suit upon the contract to prevent circuity of action.
2. The plaintiffs entered into a contract with the Florida Railroad Company
to construct for the company a swinging drawbridge over a river in
Florida, in accordance with a submitted plan and tracings, for a stipulated price. In an action upon the contract for the price stipulated, the
company set up part payment, and alleged defective construction of the
bridge and delays and expenses incident thereto, and claimed by way of
recoupment to deduct from the demand of the plaintiffs the damages
thus sustained. On the trial the deposition of a witness was offered,
to whom interrogatories were put inquiring, whether the structure and
arrangements of the bridge caused any injury or damage, hindrance or
delay, to the company in the running of its railroad; and whether any
hindrance or delay was caused by the imperfect construction of the
bridge to any vessel in the navigation of the river; and whether the
structure or working of the bridge rendered it liable to be injured or

destroyed by vessels navigating the river; and what number of hands
were required to work the drawbridge, and what number would be necessary if it had been properly constructed; Held, that the interrogatories
were pertinent and proper in themselves; that the objection tbat they
related to speculative damages did not apply to the first and last, in
which the damages sustained would be the subject of actual estimation,
and that the facts sought would at least have furnished elements to the
jury for a just estimate of the damages to be recouped from the deiland
of the contractor.
3. To render an exception available in this court it must affirmatively appear
that the ruling excepted to affected or might have affected the decision
of the case. If the exception is to the refusal of an interrogatory, not
objectionable in form, put to a witness on the taking of his deposition,
the record must show that the answer related to a material matter involved; or, if no answer was given, the record must show the offer of
the party to prove by the witness particular facts, to which the interrogatory related, and that such facts were material.
4. Where a contract calls for the construction of a drawbridge upon which
the cars of a railroad company can cross, it implies that the bridge shall
be serviceable for that purpose ang capable of being used with like
facility as similar bridges properly constructed. If a defect in the condition of a pier upon which the bridge is to rest will prevent this result
from being attained, it is the duty of the contractors to insist upon an
alteration of the pier, or to make it themselves, before proceeding with
the construction of the bridge.
5. Where a pier of a bridge was built under the supervision of an agent of
the contractors for the bridge, and in accordance with his directions, he
is held to have knowledge of any defect in the pier, and his knowledge
in this particular is the knowledge of the contractors.

ERROR to the Circuit Court for the Northern District of
Florida; the case being thus:
In November, 1866, Smith and another entered into a contract with the Florida Railroad Company, to construct for
that company a swiuging drawbridge at the crossing of its
road over Amelia River, in Florida, in accordance with a
submitted plan and tracings, for the sum of $4360, the bridge
to be made of iron, except the chords, and ready for delivery
to the company by the 1st of February following, and the
money for its construction to be paid on its completion, in
accordance with the specifications.
The present action was brought against the company upon
this contract, and was in form to recover damages for its
breach, but in fact to recover the money stipulated for the

work, the plaintiffs contending that the bridge was constructed by them in accordance with the contract, and was
received by the company in the summer of 1867. In defence to the action the company set up part payment of the
demand, and also alleged that the bridge was constructed
in an imperfect and defective manner, so as to be unfit for
the uses for which it was designed, and that to remedy its
defects and make it of use, the company was compelled to
incur large expenditures for material and labor, and was
subjected to special damages by the detention it caused
to a vessel on the river. The expenditures thus incurred
and the special damages thus sustained the company sought
by way of recoupment to deduct from the demand of the
plaintiffs.
On the trial the defendant introduced evidence to show
that the bridge was improperly constructed; that the draw,
was defective and worked with difficulty; that the contractors frequently received notice of the defects, and that they
had admitted that the arrangements were imperfect and had
made repeated efforts to remedy the defects until September,.
1869; that the floor beams and stringers placed in the bridge
were made of wood instead of iron, and that the differencebetween their cost and that of iron beams and stringers was.
about $2500; that the bridge was not completed so as to
enable the cars of the company to cross upon it until the
summer of 1867, and although then used by the company
for the passage of cars, it was never formally received as.
constructed in accordance with the contract.
The defendants also offered the deposition of a witness by
the name of Meador, taken in the case, and part of it was
received and read. Some of the interrogatories to this witness and his answers to them were excluded. The deposition, as read, showed that the witness had acted as engineer
of the Florida company during the construction of the
bridge and until the summer of 1869; that its construction
did not fulfil the conditions of an ordinary railroad drawbridge on account of the difficulty in opening and closing
it; that it was not in good working order at any time durvol. xxi.

ing his connection with the road; that the defects in'the
turning arrangements were communicated to the plaintiffs
soon after the bridge was built, and that complaints continued to be made until he came away, in 1869. The interrogatories, the answers to which were excluded, were as
follows:
"1st. State whether the structure and arrangements of said
bridge caused any injury or damage, hindrance or delay, to the
defendants in the running of the railroad on the same; and if
so, state particularly what.
"2d. State whether or not any hindrance or delay was caused
by the imperfect construction of said bridge to any vessel, steamboat, or craft in the navigation of said river over which said
bridge was built; and if so, what.
"3d. State whether or not the imperfect structure or working of said bridge caused danger of its injury or destruction by
vessels navigating said river; if so, the reason of such damage.
"4th. State the number of hands required to work said drawbridge, and how many would be necessary if properly constructed."
The objection to these interrogatories was that they related to speculative damages. The court excluded them
and the answers to them, and the defendant's counsel excepted to the ruling. The answers were not contained in
the record.
The defendants also offered to prove by experts that the
plan of the machinery and the machinery itself on which the
bridge rested and swung was so defective and so unskilfully
put up, and the turning gear itself so defective and unskilfully attached, that it took eight or ten men to swing the
bridge, and that the bridge had to be swung twice a week
on an average at a cost of $15 every time it was swung. And
further, to prove by experts that under a contract to build
such a drawbridge as was specified in the contract between
the parties to this suit, it was the common understanding
among persons skilled in bridge building that the bridge
should be so constructed as to be easily turned in two or
three moments by one man. And further, to prove by ex-

perts that in the construction of bridges of the kind in question, it was always understood that whether the kind of material was specified or not the builders are bound to use
good material and to make strong and substantial work
adapted to the use and purpose for which it is intended.
And further, to prove that in the profession and business of
bridge building it is always understood by a contract to
build a drawbridge that it is to be built of good material
and in a workmanlike manner; and also to prove by experts that the quality of material of this bridge, both wood
and iron, was very bad, and put together in an unworkmanlike manner.
The court ruled that the proof thus offered was inadmissible and irrelevant, and the defendant's counsel excepted.
There was evidence in the case offered on the part of the
plaintiffs tending to show that the imperfect working of the
draw of the bridge was owing to a defect in the pier, consisting in the variation of the pier from a level, as it was originally laid. It also appeared in evidence that the pier was
built under the supervision of an agent of the contractors by
the name of Grant, and in conformity with his directions,
and was accepted by him as sufficient, and that be supervised
also the construction of the bridge.
The court instructed the jury, in substance, that if they
found from the evidence that the difficulty in turning the
bridge arose from the defect in the pier, and not in the
bridge, then the fault would be in the defendant, whose
duty it was to put the pier in proper order to receive the
bridge. The court continued:
"But it is urged that Grant, the agent of the plaintiffs for the
building of the bridge, superintended and directed the laying of

the granite coping of the pier, and, therefore, if imperfectly
done, the plaintiffs were responsible. That may be true if it
were shown that Grant in so doing was acting within the scope
of his authority as agent for the plaintiffs; but unless the jury
find from the evidence that Grant was authorized by the plaintiffs to furnish the pier as well as build the bridge, any direction
of his to the builder of the pier cannot affect or prejudice the

rights of the plaintiffs, or bind them in any degree. There is
no evidence that he had any authority from the plaintiffs to do
anything but build the bridge."
To this instruction the defendants' counsel excepted.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, assessing their
damages at $4014. Upon this verdict judgment was entered,
to review which the case was brought here on writ of error.
Mr. W. M. Merrick, for the plaintiff in error; Mr. J. H. B.
Latrobe, contra.
Mr. Justice FIELD, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court, as follows:
The interrogatories to the witness Meador, the answers to
which were excluded, inquired whether the structure and
arrangements of the bridge caused any injury or damage,
hindrance or delay, to the company in the running of its
railroad, and whether any hindrance or delay was caused by
the imperfect construction of the bridge td any vessel in the
navigation of the river, and whether the structure or working of the bridge rendered it liable to be injured or destroyed
by vessels navigating the river, and what number of hands
were required to work the drawbridge, and what number
would be necessary if it had been properly constructed.
The exclusion of these interrogatories and the answers to
them constitutes the first error assigned for a reversal of the
judgment. The objection to them was that they related to
speculative damages. This objection cannot apply to two
of the inquiries, the first and the last stated. The damages
sustained by the company by any detention of its cars from
the imperfect working of the bridge would be the subject of
actual estimation; and the same thing may be said when the
difference was ascertained between the number of hands
required to work the bridge and the number necessary if
it had been properly constructed. The facts the inquiries
sought to elicit would at least have furnished elements to
the jury for a just estimate of the damages to be recouped
from the demand of the plaintiffs. All damages directly

arising from the imperfect character of the structure, which
would have been avoided had the structure been made pur
suant to the contract, and for which the defendant might
have instituted a separate action against the contractors,
were provable against their demand in the present action.
The law does not require a party to pay for imperfect and
defective work the price stipulated for a perfect structure;
and when that price is demanded, will allow him to deduct
the difference between that price and the value of the inferior
work, and also the amount of any direct damages flowing
from existing defects, not exceeding the demand of the
plaintiffs. This is a rule of strict justice, and the deduction
is allowed in a suit upon the contract to prevent circuity of
action. In some States the law goes further and permits
the defendant to recover judgment for any excess in his
damages over the demand claimed. But although the interrogatories were pertinent and prope r in themselves, we are
unable to decide whether any harm resulted from the ruling
of the court in excluding them and the answers obtained, for
the answers are not contained in the record. For aught
that we can know, the witness may have answered that he
was unable to state what injury or damage, hindrance -or
delay was occasioned to the company in the running of. the
road by the defective character of the bridge, or what number of handsowere employed or would have been necessary
if the bridge had been properly constructed. We cannot,
therefore, see that any harm resulted to the defendant from
the exclusion. Whatever may be the rule elsewhere, to render an exception available in this court it must affirmatively
appear that the ruling-excepted to affected or might have
affected the decision of the case. If the exception is to the
refusal of an interrogatory, not objectionable in form, the
record must show that the answer related to a material
matter involved; or, if no answer was given, the record
must show the offer of the party to prove by the witness
particular facts, to which the interrogatory related, and that
such facts were material. Such has been the decision of this
court in several cases, and was distinctly affirmed at the

present term in the ease of Packet Company v. Clough.* We
must, therefore, dismiss the first assignment of error as untenable.
But the defendant also offered to prove by experts, among
other things, that the plan of the machinery and the machinery itself on which the bridge rested and swings, was so
defective and so unskilfully put up, and the turning-gear
itself was so defective and unskilfully attached that it took
eight or ten men to swing the bridge, and that the bridge
had to be swung twice a week on an average at a cost of
fifteen dollars each time; and that under a contract to build
such a drawbridge as is specified in the contract between
the parties, it is the common understanding among persons
skilled in bridge building that the bridge should be so constructed as to be easily turned in two or three minutes by
one man; and also, that the quality of the material of the
bridge, both wood and iron, was bad, and was put together
in an unworkmanlike manner. The Circuit Court held that
the proof thus offered was inadmissible and irrelevant, and
in this ruling there was manifest error. It in fact denied
the right of the defendant to set up any damages sustained
by way of recoupment. Whereas, that right exists in all
cases where an action is brought upon a building contract,
which imposes mutual duties and obligations, and there has
been a breach of its terms, either in the manner or time of
execution, on the part of the plaintiffs, for which a crossaction might be maintained by the defendants.
The counsel of the plaintiffs seek to avoid the error of this
ruling by insisting, that the imperfect working of the bridge

was owing to a defect in the pier and not to any defect in
the bridge, and that it was the duty of the defendant to put
the pier in proper order to receive the bridge. The court
below took this view of the duty of the defendant, and instructed tbe jury in substance, that for any defects in the pier
the defendant was alone chargeable, and that if the difficulty
in turning the bridge arose from a defect in the pier and not

RAILROAD COMPANY V. SMITH.
Opinion of the court.

in the bridge, the plaintiffs were not responsible to the defendant for the result and consequent damages. The evidence shows that the pier was built under the supervision
of an agent of the contractors, and in accordance with his
directions, and was adopted by him as sufficient. He was
superintendent in'the construction of the bridge, and the
plaintiffs were bound and he as their superintendent was
bound, before proceeding with the construction, to see that
the pier was in a proper condition for the bridge. His adoption of the pier as built was, therefore, directly within the
sphere of his agency. The alleged defect in the pier, if any
existed, consisted in its variation from a level as it was originally laid, and of course, as justly observed by counsel, was
patent to the builders at the inception and at every stage of
the construction. Under such circumstances, the contractors
can no more justify their proceeding with the work without
satisfying themselves of the fitness of the pier for the superstructure intended, than they could justify the erection of
the bridge at some *otherpoint on the river. In the case of
Jones v. MZcDermott,* it was held'that the performance of a
contract to build a house for another on his soil, and that
the work should be executed, finished, and ready for occupation, and be delivered over on a specified day, was not
excused by the fact that there was a latent defect in the soil
in consequence of which the walls sank and cracked, and
the house became uninhabitable and dangerous and had to
be partially taken down and rebuilt on artificial foundations.
The present is a much stronger case for the application of
the same principle. Here there was no latent defect discovered after the work was commenced. Whatever defect there
was, was necessarily known to the agent of the contractors
under whose supervision both the pier and the bridge were
constructed. His knowledge in this particular was their
knowledge. The contract called for the construction of a
bridge upon which the cars of the company could cross, and
implied that the bridge should be serviceable for that pur* 2 Wallace, 7.

pose and capable of being used with the like facility and
ease as similar bridges properly constructed are used. If
the condition of the pier, by its variation from a level or any
other cause, prevented this result from being attained, it was
the duty of the contractors to insist upon its alteration or to
make the necessary alteration themselves. The position of
counsel is, therefore, not tenable, and the instruction of the
court upholding itwas erroneous.
Other exceptions were taken to the rulings of the court,
but as we have noticed those that went to the substance of
the defence and the attempted answer to it, it is unnecessary
to consider the case further.
