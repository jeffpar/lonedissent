such a law, the only proceeding which could have been instituted under it, must have been, to forfeit the articles
seized, and not to subject them to the payment df duties. If
the case be not one of forfeiture, we can"perceive no grdund

of libel, to enforce the payment of duties. No jurisdiction
is c~nferred upon that Court in such a case, either by the

THIS cause was argued by the Attorney General and Mr. Feb. td,
Potter for the appellant, and by Mr. Webster and Mr. D. B.
Ogden for the respondents.
Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the .F'b,91
Court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Court of the United Slates for the First Circuit in the District of Rhode
Island. The case was this:
On the 7th of July, 1817, Peleg Gardner made his last
will, in which, among other things, he devised as follows, "I
give and devise to my beloved son Ezekiel W. Gardner two
third parts of all that my ferry farm, so called," &c. "to
him the Paw Ezekiel W. Gardner, and to his heirs and as.
signs for ever, he, my said son Ezekiel W. Gardner, paying all
my just debts out of said estate. And I do hereby order, and
It is my will, that my son Ezekiel W Gardner shall pay all
my just debts out of the estate herein given to him as aforesaid." The testator gives to his wife, the plaintiff, Hannah,
a part of his real and personal estate for life, in lieu ofdower,
and to his daughter, the other plaintiff, other parts of his
real and personal estate.
Peleg Gardner died soon after the making of his will, and
ht. several dfi sees entered into the estates devised to them
respectively

of a claim of $ 1000 exhibited b) uire Mano. which was disallpwed, and for which a suit has been commenced against
the executrix.
The testator had devised the remaining third part of his
ferry estate to his daughter Isabel who had sold and conveyed the same to her brother Ezekiel. After which Ezekiel agreed to sell the whole estate to the appellant, Elisha
R. Potter, for the amiount of tl 5.000.
'This billis filed by the executrix and devisees of Peleg
Gardner, to subject the purchase money of the ferry estate
to the payment of the testator's debts. The decree of the
Circuit Court was in favour of the plaintiffs below; and
from that decree Elisha R. Potter has appealed to this
Court.
The bill contains many charges of fraudulent combination
between Ezekiel W. Gardner, and Elisha R. Potter, which
it-would be waste of time to review in detail, because they
are not sustained, and because the case rests on principles
of equity, which are believed to be well settled.
The first objection made to the decree is, that theplaintiffs have o right to ask the aid of a Court of equity, because
they cannot assert the claims of the creditors whocould
have proceeded at law against the estate in the hands of Ezekiel, and may now proceed at law against the remaining
estate of Peleg. That the plaintiffs can give no discharge
which will extinguish the rights of the creditors, and that the
creditors ought, for that reason, to have been made parties
to the suit.
The creditors The bill-states, and so is the fact. that tie whole estate of

will be misapplied in the like manner, so that the whole trust

might have been made parties defendants, but we do not
think them parties who may not be dispensed with. So
much of the fund as yet remains may be brought into
Court, and may be distribuled according to the rights of those
who may apply for it. We have, then, no doubt of the jurisdiction of the Court.

exists between the partes. The appeilecs seem to yield to
the authority of those modern decisions which deny the dis.
tinction between lands charged iii the hands of an heir, or
devisee, with the pay ment of debts,'and lands devised to a
tj..otee.for the payment of.debt-.. They admit, that, in
either case, the purchaser who pays the purchase money to
the person authorized i.o sell. is not bound to look to its apDlication. Baxt they contend, that if the purchase money
be misapplied with the co-operation of the purchaser, he remains liable to the'creditors for the sum so misapplied. The
-counsel for the appellants assent to this proposition. It is
scarcely necessary to say, that so much of the purchase money as remained unpoid when this suit was instituted, is liable to the creditors, and is applicable by the Court to the
purposes of the trust. What, then, is really in dispute between the parties? Nothing but the questions how much
of the purchase money remains unpaid, and how much of it
has been applied to .the debts of Ezekiel, with the co-operation of Mr. Potter.
The whole purchase made by Mr. Potter amounted to
15,800 dollars, of which 15,000 dollars were given for the
ferry estate, and 800 for a lot in Jamestown, purchased
by Ezekiel from his sister Isabel. One third of the ferry

fund.
In the arrangement between the parties, Mr. Potter rethined 3,500 dollars for a debt due to him~elf, and paid
debts due from Ezekiel, to the amount, as stated in the answers, of 1,830 dollars, maki'ng, in the whole, 5,330 dollars.
On a subsequent agreement between the parties, Polter
paid a debt of Ezekiel, amounting to 800 dollars, so that
Potter has himself paid the debts of Ezekiel to the amount
of 0,330 dollars, being 330 dollars out of the trust fund.
J]is cash payments, at that time, are stated at 318 dollars
fi6 cents.
In June, 1820. the parties came to a settlement, when a
Talance of7,729 dollars 62 cents, was found to be i the hands
of Potter, bi "whicb lie says, he gave his note, payable.to order; in ga 'd mortgages in South Kingston, or in the State of
New-York; apd a w, ;tiable cash note, payable to the defendarnt's order, for 4000 dollars, on the .25th of .1. rch.
The cash paymcnts sm bd by the defendants, amount- to
1,318 dollars 64 cents. The residue of the purchase money
has either been applied by Potter himself to the payment of
Ezekiel's debts, or is coiiprehended in the note payable in
mortgages, or remains in his hands unaccounted for. In
either case, it is liable, so far as it exceeds the sum of 5,800
dollars. which is not charged by the will, to the creditors of
Peleg Gardner. Tins Court does not enter into minute
calculations to ascertain the precise sum due. An account.
if it be found necessary, comprehending the necessary calculations of interest, may be taken in the Circuit Court.
The note payable in mortgages is not alleged to be paid,
and, not being negotiable, would pass td an assignee, subject
to the equity which was attached to it when in the hands of
Ezekiel W. Gardner.
The defendant, Elisha R. Potter, has been stated to be
liable for the ddbts of Peleg Gardner, for so much of the
purchase money of the trust estate as remains in his hands.
So far he is liable directly and mmediatelv, and is properly

decreed to pay the money into Court. But, so far as hqhae
applied the money to the debts of Ezekiel, his r~sponsibility
is not, we think, imnediate' but depends on ie failure of

Gardner. Ezekiel to pay, the decree ought, in the first instance, to be
against Ezekiel, and, if the money cannot be obtained from
him, then against Elisha R. Potter.
No doubt exists of the right of any of the parties to contest the claim of any creditor. The report of the commissioiuers may be prmafacse,but is not conclusive evidence of
the claim. The creditor may ascertain his debt by a suit in
the State Court, or thq executrix may contest it in the Court
oj the United States. If Elisha R. Potter, or Ezekiel W.
Gardner, suppose the executrix to be ,unfaithful to her duty
in this respect, the Court will permit either of them to use
her name in opposition to the claim.
We are of opinion, that so much of the decree as may
subject Elisha R. Potter to the debts of Peleg Gardner, beyond the purchase money remaining in his hands, and beyond the money paid by him in diicharge of the debts of
Ezekiel W. Gardner, after deducting therefrom the amount
of the estates purchased by the said Ezekiel from his sister
Isabel, ought to be reversed, and that, in all other things, it
ought to be affirmed.

This cause came on, &c. On consioeration
whereof, this Couit is of opinion, that there is error in so
much of the decree of the said Circuit Court as subjects
Elisha R. Potter t9 the payment of a larger sum of money
than now remains in his hands of the original purchase money, added to the sum he has applied to the payment of the
debts of Ezekiel W Giardner, after deductingt therefrom
the amount given for the estates purchased from Isabel
Gardner; and in so much of the said decree as directs the
said Elisha R. Potter to pay the sums he has misapplied to
the debts of Ezekiel W. Gardner, and for which he, the
said Ezekiel, is liable in the first instance, before he, the
said Ezekiel, shah, have fail '1 to pay the same. It is,

the said -decree as is contrary to this opinion, be iEVERSED and ANNULLMD. and that the same be, in all other

Circuit Court, with directions to refoinm the said decree according to this opinion, and to do all other things therein as
equity and justice may require. In taking any account bVetween any of the parties which may be necessary for giving effect to this order, interest is to be computed according
to law'and usage.
