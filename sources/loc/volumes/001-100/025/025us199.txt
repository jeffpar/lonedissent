The bl was instituted bylames Hibbits in his
and a-ter his death the suit was revived tit the names of the
appellees, his heirs at law, after v:hich the defendants, now
appellants, appeared and auswered.
The object of the tnt was, to have delivered up to the
complainant a land warrant of 5,000 acres, which hiad been
issn-itd tit the name of James fl;bbas, upon, an entry made
by him in John ArtnstroiWs office, No. 394., and to restrain
James and Heiir) IN M. Connor, and each of them. Irom
procuring a grant utpo:t a survey which had been made and
returned for die use of James Connor, by virtue of the
warrant, under colour of certain assignis ents alleged by
James and Henry Connor to have been made b) Hitbbits,
and to have those assignments set aside.
It appears, Ihat James Connor held a writing under seal,
dated the 25th of September, 1796, purporting to be signed
and executed by James Hibbits, to the following effect; " I,
James Hibbits, of the county of Iredell, and State of North
Carolina, for and in consideration of the sum of ninetythree pounds ten shillings, of the State aforesaid, have
granted, bargained, and sold, to James Connor, of Mecklenburgh county. and State aforesaid, a 5,000 acre warrant
entered in Colonel John Armstrong's office, No. 394, and I
do authorise Colonel William Polke, or any ofbis deputies,
or any other surveyor, to issue the returns, when'the land .is
surveyed, in the name of James Connor."
The execution of this assignment is contested by the bill,
which suggt-sts, that a mere order for the delivery of the
warrant was given, witioiit any terms of transfer; but its
due execution is expressly averred by the answer, and clearly
sustained by evidnce.
It appears, from the statements of the bill and answer of James Connor, that although this assignment purports to be general and absolute, there was a parol agreement and understanding between the parties at the time of
its execution, qualifying its general import. But the parties

OF THE UNITED STATES,
1827.
differ very materially as to the character and extent of this
parol agreement. Both admit that Hibbits was indebted to
Connor
Connor a sum of money, which it was not convenient then
V.
to pay, but they differ as to its amount. Both agree that Featherstone
the sum so due from Hibbits to Connor, and Connor's agreement to pay to government a balance due upon the entry of
about twenty-four pounds, with the interest thereon due to
the State, and for which the warrant was detained, was the
consideration of the assignment. Hibbits insists, that by
the agreement and understanding of the parties, the assignment was intended as 'a mortgage or security for the debt,
together with the advance to be made to the government.
but Connor, in his answer, expressly denies such was the
character of 'the agreement, and insists it was, that Connor
should be proprietor of the warrant, so far as these sums
would go, at the rate of sixty pounds per thousand acres.
and that the residue should be held by him in trust for Hibbits.
It appears that Connor paid to the government 45 pounds,
17 shillings and four pence. the balance due upon the entry,
with interest, and procured the warrant to issue, and be
delivered to him, on the 29th of November, 1797. It appears, that the adjustment and settlement of their respective interests in the warrant, was the subject of occasional
correspondence and negotiation between them from that
time until 1817, but that, as the land lay in the Indian
country, and could not lawfully be surveyed until the Indian
title should be extinguished by the general government, the
matter lay over until that period.
It appears that in June, 1817, James Connor sent his son.
Henry W M. Connor, with a power of attorney, and instructions, from North Carolina, to James Hibbits in Tennessee, to adjust the business within, eithef by selling to
Hibbits Connor's-interest in the warrant, or purchasing Hibdayof June, 1817.

at Hibbits' own house, a contract was made by Henry Connor, as agent of James Connor, with Hibbits, by which Hibbits agreed to transfdr and assign to James Connor, or his
agent for his use, all" Hibbits interest in the warrant, for
which Conuor agreed to convey to Hibbits by deeds with
special warranty, Connois right in two grants of 1000 acres,

in Connors name, calling to lie on Swift Creek, and also
a bond for the conveyance of 150 acres in Bedford
Connor county, in execution ofwhich agreement an assignment of
Feather-tone the whole warrant was accordingly executed b) Hibbits, and
deeds for the two grants of 1000 acres each, on Swift Creek,
and a bond for the 150 acres in Bedford County, were executed by Henry W i. Connor, as agent for James Connor.
The bill charges that this assignment was procured by
Henry W. MI. Connor "most fraudulently, and in the following manner:"-" that Hibbits was confined to his bed by
a severe and long spell of sickness, under the influence of
which he had laboured several months; that his intellect and
his faculties were so much debilitated and impaired, that he
scarcely knew any thing he was doing; that Henry Connor
represented all the lands he proposed giving for the warrant
as good and valuable lands; and he moreover represented
that the land called for in said warrant lay south of, and
without the limits of the state of Tennessee; all of which
assertions and allegations of said Henry were false, and
known by him to be so at the time. He had been correctly
informed that the land lay in this state, (Tennepsee,) and that
it-was very valuable, he had been offered for part of it six
dollars per acre, and he also knew that the two tracts of 1000
acres ,iach on Swift Creek had never been surveyed, and
that the 150 acres in Bedford county had been taken by a
better claim."
This is the substance of the charges of fraud and misrepresentation made in the bill, all of which are substantially
denied by the answer.
At thehearing of the cause, the Circuit Court decreed that
day of June, 1817, should be
,he assigiment of the

should hold any interest in the warrant by virtue of that as.
signment, and then proceeded to direct what interest the
parties should respectively hold in the warrant, under the as
-ignment and contract of 1796, and directed a release of thi
proportion allotted by the decree to the complainants ac
ordingly.
It is plain that if the assignment of 1817 ought not to b.
%.et aside, the decree must be considered not only erroneous

party should hold in the warrant under the contract and asV.

That matter was adjusted by the contract and assignment of Featherstoe.
1817; and unless that assignment should be set aside for
fraud and imposition, we cannot go behind it.
It is argued that James Uibbits was so diseased in mind
and body as to be incapable of controlling his own conduct,
and that undue advantage was taken of his imbecility by
Henry W. za. Connor. We do not think the allegation
supported by sufficient proof. Thi answer denies it; and
William Cawley is the only witness who speaks directly to
the purpose. William Alexander swears he was once at
Hibbits' house in the summer of 1817; that Hibbits was in
great agony, and then incapable oftransacting business, but
whether from the excess of bodily pain only, or conjointly
from that and mental imbecility, he is silent. The former
we think the fair and only import of his evidence, as he says
nothing of the state of Hibbits' mind, but speaks expressly
of bodily disease. Besides, it is uncertain whether this was
before or after the contract, and cannot, therefore, furnish a
circumstance in aid of Cawley's statements. Many other
witnesses depose as to Hibbits7 mental condition, whose
statements are irreconcilable with Cawleys impressions.
A letter written by Henry W. M. Connor to Adam Miller,
in which he says, "1Mr. Hibbits has found out that I made
an advantageous trade with him, that the land was in the
state of Tennessee, contrary to his expectation, and complains heavily that I took an advantage of him, that he was
a little deranged at the time," is greatly relied on in argument, not only to prove Hibbits' insanity, but to prove Henry W. M. Connor misrepresented the situation of the entry
of 5000 acres, and thereby deceived and defrauded Hibbits.
So far as the letter alludes to the state of Hibbits' mind
at the time ofthe contract, and to "an advantage" having been
taken of him, the writer evidently means to state only Mr.
Hibbits' subsequent complaints, and not the facts or circumstances actually attending the transaction. The letter cannot, then,prove that Hibbits' was deranged, or that Connor
took advantage of him, unless itis inferable from other part;

CASES IN THE SUPREME COURT
of the letter. He says, Hibbits had found out that Connor
Shad made an advantageous trade, but it would be a very
strained construction of this language, to suppose Connor
Connor
V.
Featherstone meant any thing more by it than a good bargain.
He says, Hibbits bad found out the land lay in Tennessee, contrary to his expectation ; and it has been insisted in
argument, that this fixes decisively upon Henry Connor the
imputation of fraud and misrepresentation, as to the situation and value of the 5000 acres of land. We do not think
so. In the very doubtful state of the question, where the
state boundary would run, when ascertained by public authority, the various conjectures and opinions then existing on
the subject, the near proximity of the land to the line, as afterwards established, no inference unfavourable to the fairness of Connor's conduct can justly be drawn from Hibbits'
expectation at the time of the contract that the land was not
in Tennessee, unless it were shown that Connor, by his representations, superinduced that expectation. There isnothing in the letter, and we can discover nothing elsewhere in
the evidence, conducing to prove that Connor, at the time
of the contract, made any representation on the subject of
the land being without or within Tennessee.
In the existing state of circumstances, in relation to the
position of the state line, -which was not fixed or known until
long after, it could at most be but matter of opinion or conjecture, whether the land would or would not fall within
Tennessee. It is not shown that Henry W. M. Connor e::pressed even an opinion to Hibbits on the subject; and if
Hibbits entertained an erroneous opinion, it would be going
too far, in a matter, apparently involved, at the time, in uncertainty, to hold Connor responsible for that error.
The bill charges Connor with falsely representing the
value of the 5,000 acres, but that is also denied by the answer, and there is no proof in support of the bill.
It is further argued, that the deeds made by Connor to
Hibbits for the two tracts of 1,000 acres each, calling to be
on Svift creek, being drawn by Henry W M. Connor, and
containing only a clause of special warranty, is evidence of
the fraud and undue advantage taken of Hibbits' situation.
The clause of warranty in the conveyances is to the follow1827.

above named grant from the lawful claim or claims of any Conner
V.
person or persons whatever; but it is hereby understood Featherstone
thatthe said Henry W. M. Conuor, as agent for James Connor, does not obligate himself to warrant the land called for
in the grant, but only to warrant the grant itself from all
legal claims of anv person or persons."
Whatever singularity may, at first blush, appear in this
clause of warranty, it vanishes when the state of the country.
and the titles in it, are understood. The 5,000 acre entry
of Hibbits, and the land given in exchange for it, in the
contract of 1817, at that time all lay in the Indian country,
and the Indian title tfiereon had not been extinguished. Although the warrant upon the 5,000 acre entry had issued, it
had not been surveyed, and could not be lawfully surveyed
until the Indian title should be extinguished by the general
government. Although grants had issued for the two tracts
of 1,000 acres each, calling to lie on Swift creek, it was
very probable that they had issned, as is understood to have
been the case in many instances, without actual surveys having been executed on the grant By the laws and usages
of the State, as understood to exist at the time, duplicate
warrants could be procured, and located on other lands,
whenever it appeared the land granted could not be identified for want of a survey, or was lost by a superior interfering
claim. In such a state of things, it was evidently a risking
bargain on both sides; and the peculiar clause of warranty
must be presumed to secure to Hibbits the benefit of procuring warrants for the grants, if the land could not be held
by tht grants themselves. The same remark may be applied
to the 150 acres in Bedford county, with this additional observation, that as Henry W. I. Connor did not execute a
deed of conveyance for it at the time of the contract, but a
bond for a conveyance, if the 150 acres is lost, or he is otherwise unable to convey, he is liable upon his bond, unless
he afterwards made a conveyance agreeably to his bond,
and in that case Flibbits would derive 'the same advantage

failed, and the assignment ought, therefore, to be set aside.
But the consideration agreed upon has not failed. Hibbits,
as must be inferred from the deeds for the two tracts of 1,000
acres each, was not to have a good and indefeasible title;
but such title only as the grants might give, with the incidental advantages resulting from them by the laws of the
country. The 150 acres may constitute a claim for damages, but furnishes no ground for setting aside the assignment of 1817.
This Court is of opinion, there is not sufficient evidence
to show that the assignment, dated the
day of
June, 1817, was procured by fraud, or undue advantage
taken of the situation of Hibbits; arid that the said assignment ought not to have been set aside. The decree of the
Circuit Court is, 1herefore, deemed erroneous, and must be
reversed, and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court,
with directions to dismiss the bill, with costs.
