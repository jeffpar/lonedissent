TH

UNITED STATES, APPELLANTS,

v.

GARLAND.

THOMAS CURRY AND RICE

The 9th section of the act of.26th May, 1824, relative to the action of the Attorney-General in cases of appeal, is only directory, and its non-observance does
not vitiate an appeal, provided it be taken by the district attorney and sanctioned in this court'by the Attorney-General.
Azi attorney or solicitor cannot withdraw his name, after it has been entered
upon the record, without the leave of the court, and the service of a citation
upon him, in case of'appeal, is as valid as if served on the party himself.
The opinion of the court in the case of ViUabolos v. The United States (ante, p. 81)
again asserted; viz. that the appellant must prosecute his appeal to the next succeeding term of this court, and whenever the appeal is taken by entering it in
the clerk's office, the adverse party must be cited to appear at that time.
-Therefore, where an appeal was filed in the clerk's office in November, 1846, and
there was no citation to the adverse party to appear on the 7th of December,
1846 (the commencement of the succeeding term of this court), the case was not
removed upon that appeal.
Aparty may take a second appeal where the first has not been legally prosecuted.
Dut in the present case, the order of the court cannot be construed as a grant of
a second appeal.
The appeal must therefore be dismissed, on motion.

THIS was an appeal from the District Court of the United
States for Louisiana, involving the title to a large body of land
in that State. The proceedings of the District Court are
sufficiently set forth in the opinion of the court and in the
argument of Mi. Curry, to which the reader is referred.
Mr. Curry moved to dismiss the appeal, as having been
irregularly brought up.
The motion was argued by Mr. Curry and Mr. Jones, in
favor of it, and Mr. Clifford, Attorney-General, against it.
Mr. Curry said that the proceedings in this case were had
under the law of Congress, passed the 26th May, 1824, "enabling claimants to land (within the State of Missouri, &c.) to
institute proceedings to try the validity of their claims," &c. :
which is revived by the act of the 17th June, 1844, by "An
act- to provide for the adjustment of land claims within the
The first of these acts is in the
States of Louisiana, &c."
4th volume of the Statutes at Large, p. 52; the last one is to
be found in the 5th volume of the same work, p. 676.
The appeal is from the United States District Court for
Louisiana, sitting as a court of equity, under the provisions of
the first-recited act.

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

107

United States v. Curry et al.

The second section of this act provides, "that every petition or suit shall be conducted as in a court of equity, &c.;
and -in all cases the party against whom- the judgment or
decree of said District Court may be finally given shall be entitled to an appeal, within one year from the time. of its rendition, to the Supreme Court of the United States, the decision of .which court shall be final and conclusive between the
parties," &c.
The ninth section of said act has this provision:
That
it shall be the duty of the district attorney of the United
States for the district in which the suits authorized by this
act shall be instituted, in every case where the decision is
against the United States, and the claim exceeds one thousand
acres, to make out and transmit to the Attorney-General of the
United States a statement containing the facts of the case, and
the points of law on which the sanie was decided; and if the
Attorney-General shall be of opinion that the decision of the
District Court was erroneous, it shall be his duty to direct an
appeal to be made to the Supreme Court of the United States,
and to appear and prosecute the said appeal in that court; and
-it shall be the further duty of the district attorney to observe
the instructions given to him by the Attorney-General in that
respect."
The decree of the District Court of Louisiana sought to be
appealed from was rendered and signed on the 26th day of
June, 1846.
On the 5th of November, 1846, the following petition was
filed, upon which the 'following proceedings of the court took
place, viz. : To the Hon. T. H. McCaleb, judge of the District Court of
the United States for the District of Louisiana.
The petition of the United States respectfully shows, that
it is believed there is error in the judgment rendered against
them in this honorable court on the twenty-sixth day of June
last, 1846, in the matter of Curry and*Garland v. The -United
States.
Wherefore they pray that your honor may be pleased to
allow an appeal to be taken from said judgment to the Supreme Court of the United States.

. Upon motion of Thomas J. Durant, United States district
attorney, that the land cause No. 1, and entitled as above, appeal has been granted from the judgment rendered therein to
the Supreme Court of the United States, at Washington, and
that the said appeal has been made returnable on a subsequent
day during the present session of the Supreme Court, and not
on the first day of said term, as the practice generally is; to
the end that said case of appeal might have its chance of being
tried during the present session; and as no object will be
gained by issuing" citatibn to the. appellees, directing them to
appear at any other time than on the first day of the said term
of said court, it is therefore ordered, that the order upon the
said petition of appeal in said cause be so amended as to make
it returnable on or before the commencement of the next
annual session of the Supreme Court.
Mr. Curry further. said, that no citation upon this order
was issued until the 14th of August, 1847. But at that time
the year within which an appeal could be taken had expired
for more than a month. The citation was also irregularly
served. The following extract from the record shows the date
of the citation, and its irregular service.
United States District Court for the District of Louisiana.
To Thomas Curry and Rice Garland, greeting:
You are hereby cited and admonished to be and appear before the Supreme Court of the United States of America, to
be holden at Washington city, on the first Monday of December next, pursuant to an order of appeal granted on the thirteenth day of February, 1847, by the district judge of the
United States for the District of Louisiana, in a certain suit

United States v. Curry et al.

wherein you are plaintiff and the United States~are defendanfs,
to show cause, if any there be, why the decree rendered on
the second day of May, 1846, against the said appellants and

in your favor, should not be corrected, and why speedy justice
should not be done to the parties in this behalf.
Witness my hand and seal, at New Orleans, this fourteenth
day of- August, A. D. 1847.

Marshal's return.
Rec'd, August 27th, .1847, and on the 8th September, 1847,
served copies of the above citation on Win. C. Hamner, in person, at New Orleans, said Win. C. Hammer's name appearing
on the docket as attorney for the above-named plaintiffs.
W , SHtRiEit, D'y U. S. Marshal.
Filed 15th November, 1847.
Mr. Curry therefore moved to dismiss the appeal, on the
three following grounds, viz.: 1. Because it was taken and entered in the clerk's office on
the 5th November, 1846, and no citation issued or was served
before the next term of this court after the appeal was entered;
nor did any issue until -the year allowed to appeal in had
elapsed. Consequently there was no appeal within the year.
See the case of Villabolos v. The United States, decided at
the present term of this court.
2. There was no service of the citation of appeal, even if it
had issued in time, on the appellees, as is required by law.
3. That no appeal has been directed to.be made to the Supreme Coflrt of the United States in this case by the AttorneyGeneral, so far as the record shows, in the manner prescribed
by the .9th section of the act of 26th May, 1824
Mr. Clifford (Attorney-General) contended, on the part of the
United States, that the appeal was not taken in fact until the
13th February, 1847; that an appellant may withdraw an apSpeal and renew it; that the appeal was prayed in open court,
when no citation was necessary; that the citation was not
necessarily a part of the record, and therefore was no part of
a writ of error; that if served at any time before the return
day, the service is good.
For these and other views he referred to 4 La. Rep. 318;
Code of Practice,*art. 594; 2 Smith, Ch. Pr. 14, 37; 2 Cranch,
33; 6 Binney, 106; 6 Mass. 435; 5 Howard, 295; ,4 Cranch,
180; 3 Peters, 459; 7 Peterg, 147.
Mr. Jones, in support of the motion, contended, that -the
9th section of the act of 1824 had not been complied with;
10
voL. vI.

110

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Curry et al.

that the right of appeal was limited and not absolute, under the
2d and 9th sections of that act; that the public interest required
that frivolous cases should not be brought up; that the service
upon an attorney 'Was not sufficient; that it depended on the
rules of the court to make it, so, and here there were no rules that a reference to the record would disprove that the 13th of
February, 1847, was the time of appeal,. and show that this order was merely a m6dification of an existing appeal.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.
A motion has been made to dismiss this case for want of jurisdiction.
The appeal was taken from a!decree of the District Court of
the United States for the Louisiana District, confirming to the
appellees certain lands which they c l imed under a Spanish
grant. The decree was made on the 2d of May, 1846. But a
new trial was afterwards granted, in order that third persons,
who also claimed title to the land, might .have an opportunity
of intervening in the suit, according to the practice of the Louisiana State courts. Subsequently, however, the petition of
the intervenors was withdrawn, and another decree was passed
and signed on the 26th of Jine, 1846, again confirming the title of the present appellees. It is not material to this inquiry
whether the first or second decree is to be regarded as the final
one in the District Court.
This proceeding by new trial (instead of rehearing, as in
chancery) and intervention was irregular. And the court
seems to have followed the Louisiana State practice, when-the
acts of Congress direct that the proceedings in such cases shall
be conducted according to the rules of a court of equity. 5
Statutes at Large, 676; 2 Statutes at Large, 53.
On the 5th of November, 1846, the district attorney presented a petition to the district judge, praying an appeal, who
thereupon passed an order, indorsed on the petition, directing
it to be filed and the appeal granted. Further orders 'of the
district judge 'are also indorsed on the petition, - one directing
the appeal to be returnable to the second Monday of January,
1847; another extending the time to the third Monday in
February; and another dated the 13th of February, 1847, in
the following -words " Upon motion of Thomas J. Durant, United States district
attorney, that the land cause No. 1, and entitled as above, appeal has been granted from the judgment rendered therein to
the Supreme Court of the United States, at Washington, and
that the said appeal has been made returnable on a subsequent
day during the present session of the Supreme Court, and not

on the first day of said term, - - the practice generally is; to
the end that said case of appeal might have its chance of being.
tried during the present session; and as no object will be
gained by issuing citation to the appellees, directing them to
appear at any other time than on the first day of the said term
of said, court, it is therefore ordered, that the order upon the
said petition of appeal in said cause be so amended as to make
it returnable on or before the commencement of the next annual session of the Supreme Court."
Afterwards, on the 14th of August, 1847, a citation was issued, requiring the appellees to appear in this court on the first
Monday in December then next following. The citation states
the decree from which the appeal was made to have passed on.
May 2, 1846, and refers to the order above recited as an appeal granted on the day the order b'ars date. It was served,
as appears by the return of the marshal, on the 8th of September following, on the attorney whose name appeared on the
docket as the attorney for the petitioners, who- are the present appellees. But the affidavit of the attorney has been, filed
here, stating that he was not at that time their attorney, -that
his fee had been paid, and he had been discharged from all duty as attorney or counsel for the parties, and had so informed
the marshal at the time of the service.
In this state of the facts, several objections have been made
to the validity of this appeal. Two qf them -maybe disposed
of in very few words.
It is said that the record does not show that this appeal was
taken by the direction of the Attorney-General, according to the
provisions of the 9th-section of the act of May 26, 1824. We
think there is no force in this objection. That section is merely
directory to the officers of the United States, and intended to
guard'more effectually the public interests. And if the appeal
is taken by the district attorney, and sanctioned in this court by
the Attorney-General, it is sufficient, even though it should appear (which it does not in this instance) that the appeal was
taken without his previous direction.
So, too, as to the service of the citation on the attorney. It is
undoubtedly good, and according to the established practice in
courts of chancery. No attorney or solicitor can withdraw his'
name, after he has once entered it on the record, without the
leave -of the court. And while his name continues there, the
adverse party has a right to treat him as the authorized attorney or solicitor, and: the service of notice upon him is as valid
as if served on the party himself. And we presume that no
court would permit an attorney who had'appeared at the trial,
with the sanction of the party, express or implied, to withdraw

112

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Curry et al.

his name after the case was finally decided. For if that could
be done, it would be impossible to serve the citation where the
party resided in a distant country, or his place of residence was
unknown, and would in every case occasion unnecessary expense and difficulty, unless he lived at the place where the
court was held. And, so far from permitting an attorney to
embarrass and impede the administration of justice, by withdrawing his name after trial and final decree, we think the court
should regard any attempt to do so as open to just rebuke.
The remaining objection is a more serious one. Has this
appeal been taken and prosecuted within the time limited by
the acts of Congress ? The District Court appears to have
acted, in relation to the appeal, as it did in its previous proceedings, under the erroneous impression that it must follow
the practice of the Louisiana State courts ; without adverting
to the acts of: Congress which conferred on the court the special jurisdiction it was exercising, and which prescribe the
manner in which it shall be exercised. There was no necessity for the petition to the district judge to grant the appeal. It
was a matter of right given by law after final decree, which the
court could not refuse. Nor had it any power to prescribe the
time or manner in which the record was to be transmitted, and
the case brought before this court. That, too, is regulated by
acts of Congress, which the court can neither change nor modify.
All the orders, therefore, upon this subject were unauthorized
and void. And the validity of the appeal depends altogether
upon the laws of the United States, without reference t6 the
laws of Louisiana or orders of the District' Court.
The acts of Congress concerning appeals in cases of this
description were fully considered by the court in the case of
Villabolos v. United States, decided in the early part of
the present term, and the previous decisions of this court referred to and examined. And the court in that case held that
the appellant must prosecute his appeal to the next succeeding
term of this ccurt, and the adverse party be cited to appear at.
that time, whenever the appeal is taken by entering it in the
clerk's office. In the case before us, the appeal was filed in
the clerk's office, November 5, 1846. The next succeeding
term of this court commenced on the 7th of December in the
same year. B.t there was no citation to the adverse party to
appear at that time, and consequently the case was not removed
to this court upon that appeal. The citation which issued on
the 27th of August, 1847, would not bring up an appeal returuable to December term, 1846.
It is true, that, although this appeal was not prosecuted, yet
the district attorney might have taken another appeal at any

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

113

United States v. Curry et al.

time within a year from the date of the decree, and brought it
up by a citation returnable to the December term, 1847. The
right of a party to take a second appeal where the first had not
been legally prosecuted was decided in the case of Yeaton v.
Lenox, 8 Peters, 123. In that case, the first appeal was dismissed by the court, for the want of a proper citation. And
the appellant, before the expiration of the time limited by law
for appealing, entered a second appeal in the Circuit Couirt, and
cited the adverse party to appear at the term of this court next
following the second appeal; and the second appeal was held
good. If, therefore, the order'of February 13, 1847, could, as
contended for in the. argument, be regarded as a second appeal,
the case would be regularly before the court, upon. the citation
issued in the August following. But, after very carefully conside *ing that order, the court think that no just construction of
its language will authorize us to regard it as a second appeal.
It was evidently nothing more than a motion to extend the
time for returning the appeal previously taken; and the court
directs that its former order be so amended as to make the citation returnable to the next term of this court. The citation
which afterwards issued, in August, 1847. calls this order an
appeal, and speaks of it as an appeal granted on the day itbears
date. But this description in the citation cannot chahge the
meaning of the language used in the order. It appears, like
the preceding ones, to have been made under the impression
that the District Court had the power to regulate the time and
manner of bringing up the appeal.
It has been said that this objection is a mere technicality,
and may be regarded rather as a matter of form than of substance. But this court does not feel itself authorized to treat
the directions of an act of Congress as it might treat a technical difficulty growing out of ancient rules of the common law.
The power to hear and determine a case like "this is conferred
upon the court by acts'of Congress* and the. same authority
which gives the jurisdiction has pointed out the manner in
which the case shall be brought before us; and we- have no
power to dispense with any of these proviions, nor to change
or modify them. And" if the mode prescribed for removing
cases by writ of error or appeal be too strict and technical, and
likely to produce inconvenience or injustice, it is for Congress
to provide a remedy by altering the existing laws; not for the
court. And as this appeal has not been prosec-uted in the manner directed, within the time limited by the acts of Congress,.
it must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
Mr. Justice WOODBURY dissented:

A

'here a'bill in equity sought to enj 6 in a judgment, and charged that the complain.
ant had a good defence which he did not know of at the time when judgment at
law was rendered against him, and charged also that he was entitled to pay the
debt 'in 'the .depreCiated notes of a particular bank, of which advantage it was
attempted to deprive him by faud and collusion, and this bill was demurred to,
it was error in the court below to suistain the demurrer.

THis case was brought up by writ of-error from the District
Court of the United States for the Northern District of Mississippi.
In the year 1838, Thomas Davis, the plaintiff in error, received three thousand dollars from the Aberdeen and Pontotoa
Railroad and Banking Company in the notes of that institution,
and gave his bond for the delivery of seventyf-five bales of cotton at the town of Burlingham, on the Tallahatchie River, on
or before the 1st day of the ensuing-March. According to his
own statement in, the bill which he afterwards fileit, he paid
$ 1,685.50, and delivered eighteen bales of cotton, subject to
the order of the company. The precise time of this payment
and delivery was not stated.
On the 12th of December, 1839, William M. Tileston and
Charles N. Spofford, residing in New'York, and carrying on
business under the name of William M. Tileston & Co., obtained a judgment in"
the District Court of the United States
for the -Northern District of Mississippi against the Aberdeen
and Pontotoc Railroad and Banking Company, for a stun of'
money, the amount whereof is nowhere stated in the record.
Upon this judgment, a writ, called a writ of garnishment,
was issued by way of' execution, and served upon Davis.
This writ was retuined, duly executed, to June term, 1840.
At December term, 1840, judgment was. rendered against
.Davis and his securities, as debtors to the Aberdeen :and Pontotoc Railroad aid Banking Company for:$ 1,861 ad costs.
