UNITED STATES V. PEROT.

[Sup. Ct.

In actions of ejectment in the United States courts the strict
legal title prevails. If there are equities which would show
the right to be in another, these can only be considered on the
equity side of the Federal courts.
This record shows that plaintiff holds the only legal title
which the courts of the United States can recognize. The
oldest claim, the oldest possession, the oldest legal title, and
the only patent from the United States are with the plaintiff,
and in this action these must prevail.
We are invited by plaintiffs in error into the discussion of
the canon and civil laws of Mexico concerning the titles to
lands held by missions and other ecclesiastical bodies. We
must decline to follow this lead.
If there is any equitable reason why the only strict legal
title and the older Mexican claim and possession should not
prevail, it is not available in a court of law.
Judgment affrmed.

UNITED STATES V. PEROT.
1. Spanish grants made in Texas for lands in the "Neutral Ground," east of
the Sabine, from 1790 to 1800, are valid.
2. The Mexican league applicable to grants of such lands, being a square of
6000 varas on each side, has always been estimated at 4428.4 acres, the
vara being considered 331 American inches.
The true Mexican var is slightly less than 33 American inches; but by use
in California it is estimated at 33 inches, and in Texas at 33J inches.
4. The common usage of a country in reference to its measures should be
followed in estimating them, when mentioned in grants taking effect there.
6. Where countries have been acquired by the United States, its courts take
judicial notice of the laws which prevailed there up to the time of such
acquisition. Such laws are not foreign, but those of an antecedent government.

UNITED STATES V. PEROT.

AR. JusTrICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

The claim in this case is for four leagues of land granted by
Bernardo Fernandez, commandant of the post of Nacogdoches,
under the Spanish government, in the Province of Texas, to
Pedro Dolet, on the 27th of December, 1795, and extended in
possession on the 14th of January, 1796. The land was situated on the bayou of the Adoise, in the settlement of Bayou
Pierre, and in what is known as the Neutral Ground, lying
east of the Sabine River, and west of the arroyo Hondo, the
Kisachey, and the Calcasieu. This territory was then claimed
as belonging to Texas, and was occupied and settled by the
Spanish authorities of that province, though claimed by the
Province of Louisiana, - the Spanish settlements in Texas
having been pushed forward easterly across the Sabine. After
the cession of Louisiana to the United States, it became a
subject of dispute between our government and Spain, and the
Sabine was finally acquiesced in as the boundary line. But as
Spain owned both provinces at the time of this grant, there
can be no question as to its validity. Such a grant for a large
tract of over 200,000 acres of land in the same district was
confirmed by this court in United States v. .Davenport'sHeirs,
15 How. 1. The grant in that case was made in the same year
as the grant in this case, 1795. The court, by Mr. Justice
Campbell, said: "The land comprehended in these grants at
their respective dates was within the unquestioned dominions
of the crown of Spain. The evidence clearly established that
the commandants of the posts at Nacogdoches, before and
subsequently, were accustomed to make concessions to lands in
the neutral territory. This was not at all times an unquestioned jurisdiction, but between the years 1790 and 1800 it
seems to have been generally acquiesced in."
We think, therefore, that the grant must be sustained. The
evidence produced to authenticate it is, under the circumstances,
all that the claimants could be expected to produce.
But the grant is for four leagues only. The claimants
obtained a decree below for four American or English leagues;
and such leagues may have been inadvertently allowed in some
previous cases. But it is evident that no such leagues were in
the minds of the parties. The leagues intended were Spanish

UNITED STATES v. PEROT.

[Sup. Ct.

leagues, such as were used in land measures and grants in
Mexico and Texas at that period. Now we are bound to take
judicial notice that the Mexican league was not the same as
the American league. The laws of Mexico, of force in Texas
previous to the Texan revolution, were the laws not of a
foreign, but of an antecedent government, to which the government of the United States, through the medium of the Republic of Texas, is the direct successor. Its laws are not deemed
foreign laws; for as to that portion of our territory they are
domestic laws; and we take judicial notice of them. Fremont
v. United States, 17 How. 542, 557.
If any doubt existed as to the extent of the Mexican league,
an inquiry might be necessary to ascertain it. But no such
doubt exists. The old legal league, by the laws of Spain, and
which was adopted in Mexico, consisted of 5,000 varas; and a
vara in Texas has always been regarded as equivalent to 331
English inches, - making the league equal to a little more than
2.63 miles, and the square league equal to 4,428A., acres. This
is perfectly well understood in Texas, where controversies
respecting Spanish titles are constantly brought before the
courts.
Strictly speaking, the standard vara of Mexico is somewhat
less than 331 inches. Our engineers, at the close of the Mexican war, brought back with them a copy of that standard
found in the Mexican archives, being one of a set prepared for
distribution among the Mexican States. This standard is still
preserved in the Coast Survey office, and by careful comparison
with our standards by Professor Bache, was found to be only
32.9682 inches. This agrees very closely with the public
reports of the government of Mexico on the subject, which
make their vara 838 millimetres, which are equivalent to
32.9927 inches. Humboldt, in 1803, found it to be 839.16
millimetres, or a slight fraction over 33 inches. But it seems
that a vara measure of somewhat larger dimensions obtained
in Texas from an early period; and the result is, what has
been stated above, 32J inches to the vara, and 4,428.4 acres to
the league. The cordel, a cord of 50 varas, or about 137J feet
in length, was the instrument generally used in measuring
large tracts, one hundred of these making a league; and it is

probable that the cordel originally cmployed in Texas had become somewhat lengthened by use. See the Constitution and
Laws of the Republic of Mexico and of the States of Coahuila
and Texas, New York, 1832; also Yoakum's History of Texas,
vol. i. p. 217; Rockwell's Spanish and Mexican Laws, p. 664;
Halleck's Report, Ex. Doc. No. 17, Ho. Rep. 1st Sess. 81st
Cong. p. 145.
The standard Mexican vara is so near to 83 inches (wanting,
according to the best measurements, less than a hundredth of
an inch of that quantity), that a standard vara measure laid on
an American yard would so nearly correspond with 83 inches,
that the difference could not be perceived by the naked eye.
Hence, in California, after its acquisition by the United States,
a vara came to be considered as exactly equal to 83 inches;
and this result was sanctioned by the General Land-Office as
early as 1852. The United States surveyor-general of California, in a report to the land-office, dated at San Francisco,
Nov. 14, 1851, said: "All the grants, &c., of lots or lands in
California, made either by the Spanish government, or that of
Mexico, refer to the 'vara' of Mexico as the measure of length.
By common consent here, that measure is considered as being
exactly equivalent to tldrty-three American inches." He then
refers to other estimates found in a recent publication, and adds:
"It is important that the relative proportions of their measures
should be clearly settled. I, therefore, have to ask the aid of
the department in doing so." The commissioner, in an answer
to this letter, dated Washington, March 5, 1852, said: "You
state that by common consent it [the Mexican vara] is considered in California as exactly equivalent to 83 American
inches. I can see no reason why there should be any departure
from this ratio, and agree with you that any important change
in the length of the 'vara' recognized and acted upon in California would produce confusion."
It is understood that the department has always, since that
time, acted upon this standard of value of the vara in respect
to surveys in California; which makes the square league of
5,000 varas to the side, equivalent to 4,340.278 acres. In a
letter addressed by Mr. Wilson, Commissioner of the General
Land-Office, to the late Mr. Justice Catron, of this court, on

432

[Sup. Ct.

UNITED STATES V. PEROT.

the 20th of February, 1855, he says that the practice of the
land-office is to consider and allow the vara in California as
equivalent to 33 inches, and the league as equivalent to
4,340.27 acres.
It is important that the uniform practice and usage of a
country should be observed in the construction of all grants
made therein whilst such usage prevailed.
For this reason, we think that in Texas, and in relation to
grants emanating from the Mexican government in that province, before its separation from the parent State, the vara and
league recognized in land measures there should be respected.
Allowing the claimant, therefore, at the rate of 4,428.4 acres
to the league, according to the rate above referred to, he is
entitled to a decree for 17,713-f acres, instead of 23,040, as
decreed by the court below, requiring a deduction of 5,326k-!
acres. If the claimant will remit this excess, he will be
entitled to an affirmance of the decree for the balance, namely,
for 17,713-&.
On filing such remitter, a decree may be entered accordingly;
and it is
