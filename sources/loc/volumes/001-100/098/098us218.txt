ELCOX v. HILL.

[Sup. Ct.

ELCOX v. HILL.
1. A. brought an action against the keeper of a public hotel in Illinois to recover
the value of a stock of jewelry, worth $6,300, which he had in his travellingbags at the hotel while he was there as a guest. One of them was not
locked, and both were left by him overnight in the coat-room of the hotel,
he taking from the boy in charge a check therefor. The next morning, A.
discovered that the jewelry had been taken from the bag which was unlocked. The other bag could not be found. A. had informed no one connected with the hotel of their contents, although there was a safe there
for the custody of such property, and notice of the fact given, as required
by the statute of that State. Held, that in the absence of proof that the
loss was occasioned by the hand or through the negligence of the hotelkeeper, or by a clerk or servant employed by him in the hotel, A. was not
entitled to recover.
2. A hotel-keeper is not liable for a loss occasioned by the personal negligence of
the guest himself.
8. Evidence that a servant admitted that he had stolen the property while he
was employed at the hotel by the landlord is not admissible in an action
against the latter.

ERItOR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern District of Illinois.
This is an action of trespass on the case by Elcox and Larter
against Hill, proprietor of a public hotel in the city of Chicago,
to recover the value of a quantity of jewelry lost by them while
Larter was a guest at the hotel.
The plaintiffs were manufacturing jewellers, doing business
at Newark, N. J. Larter left home for a tour through several
Western cities, with some $6,300 worth of jewelry, which was
contained in two travelling-bags or satchels, like those usually
carried by travellers: one a large leather bag, containing about
$5,300 worth of solid gold jewelry, and the other a small
satchel, containing about $1,000 worth of jewelry. The smaller
bag was not locked and had no key.
On arriving at the hotel, Sunday morning, March 9, 1873,
he registered his name and asked for a room, but one could not
be assigned to him for some three or four hours. During the
time be was waiting he placed his travelling-bags in the coatroom and received a check therefor. Between twelve and two
o'clock, a room was assigned to him on the upper floor of the
house, and his baggage, consisting of the two bags, was taken

Oct. 1878.]

ELCOX V.HILL.

from the coat-room and carried up to the room, where he remained for some time and then came down to dinner. Before
going into the dining-room, he gave the key of his room to the
bell-boy, who had conducted him to the room and carried the
bags, and directed him to go up and bring them down and put
them in the coat-room again; and on coming out from dinner
he received from the boy the coat-room check for them. He
saw them in the coat-room two or three times after that before
he went to bed, the last time being about ten o'clock at night,
at which time William Drum, the boy then in charge of the
coat-room, as Larter said, voluntarily told him that they were
perfectly safe, and that the coat-room would be locked up at
twelve o'clock. Soon after this, Larter went to his room for
the night, and after breakfast in the morning called at the coatroom for his satchels. The small one only could be found, and
from that the jewelry had been stolen. He had previously given
no information of the contents of the bags, nor had he asked to
have them placed in the safe.
At the top of the page of the register, where he wrote his
name on entering the hotel, were printed these words :
"Money, jewels, and valuable property must be placed in the
safe in the office, otherwise the proprietor will not be responsible for
any loss2'
On the door of the room assigned to him, and on the door of
every other room, was a printed notice, containing among other
things the following 119. All guests of the house are cautioned against leaving money,
jewels, or valuables of any description in their rooms, as the proprietor will not be responsible for them if stolen. .Money or valuables, properly labelled,must be deposited in the safe at the office."
And alsb a copy of the statute of the State of Illinois, entitled "An Act for the protection of innkeepers," which is as
follows: "SECT. 1. Be it enacted by the people of the State of Illinois
represented in the General Assembly, that hereafter every landlord
or keeper of a public inn or hotel in this State, who shall constantly
have in his inn Qr hotel an iron safe in good order and suitable for
the custody of money, jewelry, and other valuable articles belonging

ELCOX V. HILL.

[Sup. Ot.

to his guests or customers, shall keep posted up conspicuously at
the office, also on the inside of every entrance-door of every public,
sleeping, bar, reading, sitting, and parlor room of his inn or hotel,
notices to his guests and customers that they must leave their
money, jewelry, and other valuables with the landlord, his agent or
clerk, for safe keeping, that he may make safe deposit of the same in
the place provided for that purpose.
" SECT. 2. That such landlord, hotel or inn keeper as shall comply
with the requirements of the first section of this act shall not be
liable for any money, jewelry, or other valuables of gold, or silver, or
rare precious stones that may be lost if the same is not delivered to
said landlord, hotel or inn keeper, his agent or clerk, for deposit,
unless such loss shall occur by the hand or through the negligence
of the landlord, or by a clerk or servant employed by him in such
hotel or inn: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall apply
to such amount of money and valuables as is usual, common, and
prudent for any such guest to retain in his room or about his
person."
For the purpose of safely keeping the valuables and jewelry of
guests, the proprietor had a very large vault built in the hotel,
which was in plain sight, back of the counter, in the office, immediately in front of Larter when he wrote his name upon the
register.
The coat-room in the hotel was only intended for the reception of ordinary hand-valises, coats, and umbrellas, and not for
valuables or jewelry: the place for valuables and jewelry waÂ§
in the safe or vault.
At the trial, the plaintiffs offered to prove by two witnesses
"eadmission to them by the boy William Drum that he had
stolen the jewelry, but on the objection of the defendant the
evidence was excluded.
The court having charged the jury that the notice (paragraph 9, supra) was a sufficient compliance with the statute,
further instructed them as follows : "If the defendant has made out to your satisfaction from
the proof that he did comply with this law by providing a safe,
and posting notices as required, then the plaintiffs, in order to
hold him liable on the ground that the loss comes within the
exceptions of the statute, must satisfy you it did in fact occur
by the hand of one of the defendant's servants employed in the

Oct. 1878.]

hotel. The mere suspicion that Drum took the goods, or suspicious circumstances, are not enough. The evidence should
be such as to reasonably satisfy your minds that the goods
were so lost by the fault or hand of this servant. The burden
of proof on this point is with the plaintiffs; and the failure or
negligence of the defendant to prosecute Drum on a criminal
charge for stealing this property does not tend to show -that
the boy was guilty, or that the loss occurred through his act.
The defendant was no more bound to prosecute this boy for
this criminal offence than any other citizen. It was a violation of the general criminal law of the land if the boy was
guilty; and any citizen was as much bound to see that he was
criminally prosecuted as was the defendant.
"I come now to consider the last point made by the defendant, and that is, that the goods in question were lost by reason
of the want of due care on the part of Larter. Negligence is
usually, in cases like this, wholly a questioi of fact for the jury.
Negligence is a relative term; that is, what is or is not neglige'nce depends upon circumstances, and you must determine,
from all the circumstances surrounding the transaction as disclosed in the proof, whether Larter's negligence contributed
directly to this loss or not. Every man is bound to act with
such prudence and care as it is presumed would be taken by
an ordinarily careful and prudent man under similar circumstances; and a failure to so act is what is called negligence.
"It is obvious that the degree of care with which a man is
bound to act must depend largely upon the degree of responsibility with which he is charged. For instance, a man who is
the custodian of several thousand dollars should be expected to
be much more prudent and circumspect in his conduct than
one with a very small sum of money; and what might be called
gross negligence in a man with valuable jewelry or a large
sum of money under his charge, might not be deemed negligence at all in a man with but little money and no jewelry or
valuables in his charge.
"The admitted facts in this case are that Larter placed these
two bags containing this large quantity of valuable jewelry
first in the coat-room, then took them to his room with the aid
of the bell-boy, then left them ii his room and sent the bell-

ELCOX V. HILL.

[Sup. Ct.

boy after them, with directions to place them in the coat-room.
Then, by frequent looks and inquiries in regard to his bags,
which he admits making, he may have betrayed such solicitude
for their safety as called attention to them unnecessarily. One
of these bags contained over $5,000 worth of jewelry, and must
necessarily have betrayed its contents, and to some extent its
value, by its weight. The conversation with this boy late in
the evening, and the acceptance of his voluntary assurances
that the bags were perfectly safe where they were, are all circumstances bearing upon the question of negligence, and to be
considered, and it is for you to say whether a person of ordinary prudence, with so responsible a trust, would have so conducted himself.
"Travellers must be presumed to know the relative duties of
the different classes of employ~s about a hotel, that is to say,
that they have no right to intrust their baggage to the care of
the table-waiter, or to the hostler, from the fact that it is not
the duty of such employ6s to look after or care for the baggage,
or take the custody of it; and it is for you to say whether the
leaving of this baggage by Larter in this coat-room was not of
itself an act of negligence, especially when he failed to inform
any one of its contents. If he had said to the landlord or the
clerk in charge of the office, "My satchel is in that coat-room,
it contains valuable jewelry;" and if the landlord or clerk had
left it there after such information, they might be held to have
assented to accept it there, and to have left it themselves in the
charge of the servant in care of the coat-room; but it is a question for you to consider whether it was not such negligence as
might amount to a fraud on the defendant for Larter to leave
this valuable property in such a place, without informing the
defendant or his proper clerk in the office of its value, so that
they might govern themselves accordingly.
"As I said before, negligence is a relative or comparative term.
Probably, if a guest at a hotel should deposit his money or jewelry with a table-waiter, or cook, or bell-boy, without direction
to do so from the landlord or clerk in charge, or leave his
satchel containing money and valuables unprotected in the
halls or public passages, or leave his money exposed in his
room, and his room unlocked, - no one would hesitate to say that

Oct. 1878.]

ELCOX v. HILL.

such an act was an act of negligence to such an extent as to excuse the landlord in case of loss. And it is for you to say in
the light of the proof, and of your own knowledge and experience of the manner in which large city hotels are necessarily
conducted, whether trusting valuable packages, such as jewelry
like this of the plaintiff, to the care of the coat-room boy was
or was not an act of negligence for which the party should suffer the consequences rather than the landlord.
1It is true, as has been urged by counsel, that the innkeeper is
responsible for the acts of his servant; but that does not justify
a guest at a hotel in intrusting valuable merchandise to the
care of a subordinate servant, whose line of duty was not the
charge or keeping of such valuables without the knowledge of
the landlord, or of his clerk in charge.
"The evidence has disclosed to you to some extent the duties
of the servants or employds of the hotel in charge of the coatroom; and it is for you to say in the light of the evidence
whether a prudent man would have intrusted to such a servant
and such a place the keeping of valuable packages like these
lost by Larter, without at least first making inquiries to ascertain
whether aiy more secure place of deposit could be provided.
"In conclusion, then, if you are satisfied from the proof that
the loss in this case occurred through the want of due care on
the part of Larter, under the circumstances, then the defendant
is not liable, even if you should believe from the proof that the
loss occurred by the fraud or the act of the boy Drum. And
if you find from the evidence that the goods in question were
not travellers' baggage, but merchandise, and intended for such
by the plaintiffs, then the defendant is not liable, unless the
defendant, or some one in his employ whose duty it was to
attend to such matters, was informed of the contents of the
bags, and accepted in some form the custody of them.
"As has been said and urged on the part of the plaintiffs, the
loss of the goods makes a prima facie case of liability, and you
must determine whether the defendant has relieved himself
therefrom by showing negligence on the part of Larter."
To all of which charge and instruction the plaintiffs excepted.
There was a verdict and judgment for the defendant, whereupon the plaintiffs sued out this writ of error.

Mr. Melville W. Fuller for the plaintiffs in error.
Mr. Robert Hervey, contra.
MR. JUSTICE HUNT delivered the opinion of the court.
There can be but little doubt that the goods of the plaintiffs
were stolen from them while one of them was at the hotel of
the defendant, in the city of Chicago. They insist thereupon
that their loss shall be made good; but it does not follow,
because they met with a loss, that they can recover the amount
from him.
The defendant contends that he is exempt from liability for
money, jewels, and the like, unless his guest who lost them comVhere a
plied with the statute of Illinois on that subject.
safe for the keeping of such articles is provided by the hotelkeeper, and the notice given as required by the statute, a loser
failing to take the benefit of the protection thus furnished him
must bear his own loss. Hyatt v. Taylor, 42 N. Y. 258; Stewart
v. Parsons, 24 Wis. 241.
To this rule the statute makes one exception. If the loss
occurs "by the hand or through the negligence of the landlord,
or by a clerk or servant employed by him in such hotel or inn,"
the liability remains. The judge submitted that question to
the jury, who found against the plaintiffs.
It is settled by the authorities that where the loss is occasioned by the personal negligence of the guest himself, the
liability of the innkeeper does not exist. Purvis v. Coleman
& Stetson, 21 N. Y. 111; Cook v. The Champlain Transportation
Co., 1 Den. (N. Y.) 91.
The question of personal negligence was properly submitted
to the jury, and was also found against the plaintiffs.
The court refused to receive evidence that William Drum
had admitted that-he had stolen the jewelry in question. If
he was guilty of the offence, the fact should have been established by due proof. If he were on trial himself, his admission
would be competent, but upon no principle could he admit away
the rights of another person.
Judgment afirmed.
