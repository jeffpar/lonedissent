Judgment affirmed.

BLAXE v. HAvUs.
1. An appointment under a power is an intent to appoint carried out, and, if
made by the last will and testament of the donee of the power, the intent,
although not expressly declared, may be determined by the gifts and directions made, and if their purpose be to execute the power, the instrument
must be regarded as an execution.
2. A., who had a power to appoint a fund in the hands of B., made her will,
wherein she declared her intention thereby to execute all powers vested in
her, particularly those created in her favor by certain deeds executed in
1839, whereby she became entitled to appoint that fund. Following this
declaration were various gifts ofpecuniary legacies for charitable purposes,
amounting to $28,500, and also provisions for the payment of certain annuities. Special disposition and appropriation were made of her personal
property, which consisted of household furniture, carriage and horses, a
growing crop upon a farm, a small sum of cash in hand, some petty debts
due her, and about sixty slaves, the latter constituting nearly nine-tenths of
the value of the whole. Certain real estate was also to be sold, and the proceeds applied to a specific purpose. The will declared that if it should
appear at her decease that the bequests exceeded the amount of funds left,
the first five only (those to charities) should be curtailed until brought
within the assets. The fund in the hands of B. was not more than sufficient to pay the legacies. Held, 1. That it was the intention of the testatrix that the legacies to charitable purposes and to pay annuities should
be paid, but not from the proceeds of the personal property which she
owned in her own right, and specifically appropriated. 2. That the will
was an execution of the power, and it appointed the whole fund to her
executors.

3. The "deed of explanation" (infira, p. 317) executed in 1S15 was effectual, and
its operation was to reduce the annuity charged upon the lands in flit dImd
of 189 proportionately as A. reduced the fund charged by h.r appointyear .qual

to six per cent interest on so much of said fund as rcmaizn d unalipr priated or unexpended by her in each and every year repcctively.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Eastern District of North Carolina.
George Pollock, who was seised and possessed of a largc
estate, consisting of lands, slaves, and personal effects, died in
1839. He devised and bequeathed it all to his sister Fraict's,
wife of John Devereux, by whom she had three childrvn,
Thomas P., George, and Frances Ann who intermarried with
Leonidas Polk. George died leaving his children Elizaleth
and Georgina surviving him, the former of whom is the 'wife
of Grinfill Blake, and the latter of John Townsend.
On July 8, 1839, John Devereux and Frances his wife conveyed to Thomas P. Devereux in fee the real estate so devised
subject, however, to charges as follows: -

"First,that the said Thomas P. Devereux, his heirs and assign,
shall, on the first day of March in each and every year during the
life of the said Frances Devereux, pay to the said Frances, into her
own hands, or according to her own order, and to her sole and
separate use, and subject to her own disposal, as if she were a
feme sole and unmarried, the yearly sum of $3,000."
" Thirdly, that the said Thomas P. Devereux, his heirs or
assigns, shall invest for, or pay to, the said Frances, at such times, in
such proportions, and in such manner and form as she shall direct
and require, to and for her own sole and separate use, and subject
to her own disposal by will, deed, or writings in nature thereof, or
otherwise, to all intents and purposes (notwithstanding her coverture) as if she were afeme sole and unmarried, the sum of 65U,000;
but if the said sum of money, or any part thereof, shall remain unpaid,
or shall not be invested during her life, and if the said Frances shall
not by deed, or will, or writing in nature thereof, or by some other
act give, grant, dispose, or direct any payment, investment, or application of the same, then the said sum of money, or so much thereof
as shall remain not paid, given, granted, disposed, or directed to be
invested, paid, or applied, shall be considered as lapsing, and the
charge therefor as extinguished for the benefit of the said Thomas.'

BLAKE V. HAWKINS.

On the same day John Devereux also conveyed to said
Thomas tihe personalty bequeathed by said Pollock.
John Devereux died in 1844, and in 1845 his widow executed a "deed of explanation," which, after referring to that
of July 3, 1839, is as follows:
"And whereas in and by *the same the sum of $50,000 was
secured to the said Frances, together with an annuity of $3,000;
and whereas the annuity was by the said Frances understood to
be the interest of the said sum of $50,000, and not in addition
thereto, and was to abate as the principal of the said sum was from
time to time paid; and whereas doubts have arisen whether the
said deed may not bear a contrary construction, and the said
annuity be chargeable on the said estate over and above the said
$50,000:
Now, these presents are to declare that the true meaning and
intent of the part of the said settlement above referred to is, that
the sum of $50,000, with the annual interest thereon, was to be
hereby reserved to the said Frances, and that the said interest was to
cease pro rata as portions of the said principal sum were from time
to time paid and discharged, in the same manner as if the same
was a debt due by the said estate, and that no annuity except the
said interest was intended to be reserved by the said settlement to
the said Frances."
In 1849 she died. Her last will and testament, bearing date
Dec. 23, 1847, was, after protracted litigation, admitted to probate in August, 1852. The first and introductory clause is as
follows : -

"I, Frances Devereux, of North Carolina, . . . do make and
ordain this my last will and testament, intending thereby to execute all powers vested in me, and enacted in any deed or deeds
heretofore executed, particularly those powers created in my favor
by two certain deeds settling and assuring the estate of my late
brother, George Pollock, to my son, Thomas P. Devereux, dated
some time in the month of July, in the year of our Lord eighteen
hundred and thirty-nine, and executed by my late husband and
myself."
She bequeathed by the first five items five legacies, of $4,000
each, to five several charitable institutions; by the sixth, $500
to her executors for a charitable purpose; by the eighth,

BLAKE V. HAWKINS.

on the same annually to the payment of cert:aiii annuitics
and charities therein specified; by the twelfth, .5500 to S. S.
Souter, for a charitable purpose specified. There is no other
pecuniary legacy, and no residuary devise or beque.t. "lhoiuis
P. Devereux and others were appointed executors. but did
not qualify as such. Seymour W. Whiting, who had be.ii
appointed administrator pendente lite, was, Nov. 16, PI52,
appointed administrator cum testamento annexo. Her heirs-atlaw and next of kin were her children, Thomas P. and Frances
Ann, and her grandchildren, Elizabeth and Georgina. 11er
property at her death consisted of so much of the aforesaid
$50,000 and the annuity of $3,000 per annum as she had not
appointed or expended during her lifetime, upwards of sixty
negro slaves, the growing crop and farming stock and utensils
on her farm in Bertie County in that State, which she was cultivating jointly with a grandson, the household and kitchen
furniture at her residence in Raleigh, and some small amount
in cash on hand and petty debts due to her.
On March 26, 1859, the complainants, said Elizabeth and
Georgina, filed their bill in equity against Thomas P. Devereux, Leonidas Polk and Frances Ann his wife, setting forth
the foregoing facts, and further alleging that the said Thomas's
pretended renunciation of his executorship, and the appointment of said Whiting as administrator with the will annexed,
were as to the complainants wholly void and of no effect; that
the said Thomas was accountable to them in equity, as executor, for their share of the assets of the said Frances remaining
after the payment of her debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, and the legacies, which last, it was alleged, did not
exhaust said assets, but left a large amount in his hands for
distribution, to one-third of which they were entitled.
The bill alleges that said Thomas, both before and after
his renunciation, intermeddled with her assets, and had the
exclusive control and administration thereof; that lie took
possession of them immediately upon her decease, disposed of
them from time to time, and converted them to his own use;
especially that on or about the 7th of October, 1852, he, before
the appointment of Whiting as administrator with the will

Oct. 1878.].

BLAKE V. HAWKINS.

annexed, caused fifty-seven slaves belonging to her estate to be
appraised and divided between himself and Frances Ann Polk;
and that he had then in his possession, or in the possession of
his attorney or agents, the original paper or a copy thereof,
containing the details of said appraisal and division; that said
Whiting was appointed by the procurement of said Thomas
and as a mere form, the latter becoming his bondsman; that
Whiting, if he acted at all in the administration of said: assets,
did so entirely under the direction of said Thomas; that he
never returned an inventory, nor rendered an account of his
administration, and is now deceased; that said Thomas's renunciation was a contrivance to avoid being called to account;
that he procured said renunciation to be accepted by a concealment and suppression of the facts above stated; that he
purchased up the pecuniary legacies for about half their
amount, and claimed for himself the profit derived therefrom;
that he paid debts of the testatrix, and converted the residue
remaining in his hands to his own use; and that her estate
and effects were in fact administered and disposed of by him
before the appointment of said Whiting in November, 1852.
The bill prayed for a discovery and for an account.
The defendants, Leonidas Polk and wife, entered an appearance, but neither demurred nor answered. The defendant
Thomas filed his answer, admitting the main facts set out in
the bill, but denying all fraud, and insisting that if, upon the
proper construction of the deeds made to him, it is somewhat
doubtful whether the yearly reservation of $3,000 was not intended to be a stipulation for the annual payment of the interest upon the sum of $50,000, such was the intention of said
Fiances, and if not expressed, it was a mistake in drafting
them; that after the death of her husband she executed an
instrument declaring such interpretation and intention; and
that he is not liable to account for the said sum of $50,000, nor
for the interest thereon, because she did not appoint the same
by her will, and therefore the same lapsed for his benefit. He
refuses to make any discovery, or to render any account of the
same. He denies that he is accountable to the complainants
as her executor; alleges that he renounced that office; denies
that he intermeddled with the assets in any other manner than

BLAKE V. HAWKINS.

[Sup. Ct.

as is set out in his answer; and in this connection gives an
account of his purchase of the pecuniary legacies from the
several charitable institutions, and of some of the dealings nnd
accounts between himself and Whiting, while the latter aet(-d
as administrator pendente lite, and after he became administrator with the will annexed. He filed other exhibits, the proceedings connected with the caveat of the will, showing his
purchase of the legacies, and his conveyance of part of her
slaves to the trustee of Frances Ann Polk, all executed before Whiting was appointed. He also filed exhibits showing
accounts rendered to him by said Whiting.
The complainants excepted to the sufficiency of the answer,
because it failed to set out whether he had not divided fiftyseven slaves of the testatrix between himself and Frances Ann
Polk, on the 7th of October, 1852, before Whiting was appointed, and a paper writing evidencing said division; because
it failed to set out the disposition made of the $50,000 find
and the $3,000 annuity; because it did not set out the tenor
and contents of certain paper writings, in refereice to the
management of that fund, which he admitted he had 'obtained
from Whiting.
He thereupon further answered, refusing to account for the
$50,000 charge and the $3,000 annuity, and to disclose the
contents of the paper writings received friom Whiting, because they referred to the management of the $50,000 charge;
but he exhibited the paper writing evidencing the division
of the fifty-seven slaves between himself and Frances Ann
Polk.
The plaintiffs filed their replication at the November Term,
1859, but at the June Term, 1860, withdrew it, at request of
said Thomas, who filed an amended answer, and the replication
was then refiled.
At the November Term, 1860, no depositions having been
taken, the cause was set down for hearing upon the pleadings,
exhibits, and proofs.
Thomas P. Devereux having become a bankrupt, that fact
was suggested, and William J. Hawkins and George W. Mordecai, his assignees, were made parties defendant.
Said Thomas having died, the suit was revived against R. C.

BLAKE V. HAWKINS.

Badger, administrator de bonis non, cum testamento annexo, of
Frances Devereux, deceased.
At the June Term, 1869, the court passed an order, referring
the case to a master to state an account, 1, of the payments.
out of the annuity of $3,000, or out of the $50,000 in trust, to
or by direction of Mis. Devereux; 2, of the charitable bequests in the will, and of the sums actually paid in satisfaction
or purchase of them; 3, of the balances, if any remaining, of
the $3,000 and $50,000, after deducting the sums paid to her,
or by her direction, during her life, and in satisfaction of legacies since her death; 4, also of the administration of her
estate, showing the amount of assets (excluding balances, if
any, of the $3,000 and .$50,000), and of the debts paid, and the
balance, if any.
At the November Term, 1873, the master filed his report.
At the June Term, 1874, the case having been heard upon the
pleadings,: exhibits, proofs, order of reference, and report of the
master, and the exceptions filed thereto, the court decreed,1. That Frances Devereux did not by her last will and
testament appoint the fund of $50,000, which, by the deed of
July 3, 1 39, conveying her lands to Thomas P. Devereux, she
had powor to charge upon said land, to be part of her general:
personal estate in the hands of her executors; nor appoint the
said fund at all, except so far as it is necessary to resort to the
same to pay off the pecuniary legacies bequeathed by her in her
said will, after exhausting for that purpose what remains of her
general ,personal assets, after payment of her debts and funeral
expenses, and the costs of administering her estate.
2. That "the deed of explanation," executed by the said
Frances in 1845, was effectual; and that the operation thereof
was to educe the annuity of $3,000 charged upon said lands, in
said deed of 1839, proportionably as the said Frances reduced
the aforesaid $50,000 by her appointments or outlays, so as to
make said annuity, in each and every year, equal to six per
cent interest on so much of said fund of $50,000 as remained
unapp'ointed or unexpended by the said Frances, in each and
every.year respectively.
3., That the plaintiffs are not entitled to any account of the
said fnund of $50,000, except so far as it is necessary to take an
YOL. VIII.

21

BLAKE V. HAWKINS.

[Sup. Ct.

account of the same to ascertain the amount of the aforesaid
annuity, in each and every year during the life of the said
Frances, but that they are entitled to an account of so much of
said annuity as remained unexpended in the hands of 'hI'ionias
P. Devereux at the date of the decease of the said Frances. and
also to an account of so much and such parts of the general
personal estate of the said Frances, including the negro slaves
divided between the said Thomas P. and the defendant, Leonidas Polk, in October, 1852, as came to the hands of the said
Thomas P. after the decease of the said Frances; but the said
Thomas P. is not liable to account with the plaintiffs generally, as executor of the last will and testament of the said
Frances, for all her personal estate; and especially is he not
liable to account with them for so much, or such parts, of
said personal estate as came into the hands of said Whiting,
deceased, to be administered by him, either as administrator
pendente lite, or as administrator aum testamento annexo of the
said Frances.
4. That in taking the account with the estate of the said
Thomas P., now in the hands of the defendants, who are his
assignees in bankruptcy, the said assignees are to be credited
with the amounts which the said Thomas P. expended in purchasing up the pecuniary legacies bequeathed by the said Frances to the several charitable societies, and the said assignees are
not to be credited with the full amount of said legacies, unless
or except where the said Thomas P. paid the full amount
therefor.
5. That, in taking the account last aforesaid, the master
shall regard the paper writing bearing date Oct. 2, 1846,
signed by Frances Devereux, and accompanying the master's
report, as an exhibit, as a stated account between the said
Frances and Thomas P. Devereux, deceased, conclusive of -all
matters of account between them, both in respect to the
$50,000 fund and the 83,000 annuity aforesaid, previous to
and including the twenty-second day of June, 1846, excepting
such matters of account as are, by the express terms of the
said paper writing, saved out of its operation, for future adjustment, by reference or otherwise; ascertaining the balance
due by the said Thomas P. to the said Frances, subject to the

Oct. 1878.]

BLAKE V. HAWKINS.

exceptions and corrections last aforesaid, on the said twentysecond day of June, 1846, to be $29,664.60.
6. That in taking said account the master shall also regard
the paper writing made out some time in the latter part of
the year 1847, signed by William D. Cooke, and accompanying
said report, as an exhibit, as a stated account between the said
Frances and Thomas P. Devereux, deceased, conclusive of all
matters of account between them, in respect to the $50,000
fund and the $3,000 annuity aforesaid, and all other matters,
previous to and including the twenty-first day of June, 1847,
saving such matters of account as are, by the note at the foot
of said paper writing, expressly excepted out of its operation,
for future adjustment, by reference or otherwise; ascertaining
the balance due by the said Thomas P. to the said Frances,
subject to the exceptions and corrections last aforesaid, on the
said twenty-first day of June, 1847, to be $25,086.97.
The complainants having waived a re-reference to the master,
the account was forthwith corrected, so as to conform to this
decree, and a final decree entered, that the complainants recover $722.14 against the assignees in bankruptcy of T. P.
Devereux, deceased; from which decree the complainants appealed to this court, and here assign the following errors :
The court below erred, because, 1. Under the circumstances of this case, Thomas P. Devereux,
as the executor of said Frances, was liable to account with the
plaintiffs for all her personal assets.
2. Her will was an appointment of the whole of the $50,000
charged upon the land, conveyed to him by deed of July 8,
1889, to be part of her general personal assets in the hands of
her executors.
8. The instrument styled "the deed of explanation," executed
by her in 1845, was ineffectual for any purpose, having no
operative words of release or receipt: it was presumptively
fraudulent for him, a trustee, to take it from his cestui que trust.
It cannot be used even as evidence to correct the alleged mistake in the deed of July 8, 1889; and it in no manner affects
the annuity of $3,000, so as to reduce the amoumt thereof.
4. As executor, he ought to be charged with all arrears of
the whole of the $8,000 annuity, created by the deed of July 3,

BLAKE V. HAWKINS.

[Sill. Ct.

1839, charged on his land, which were unexpended or unappointed by her at her death, as part of her personal assets in
his hands.
5. In taking his account as executor, the paper writing bearing date Oct. 20, 1846, signed by her, which was not pleaded or
set up in the answer, ought not to be regarded as a stated account, conclusive of all matters of account between him and her,
before and including.the 22d of June, 1846, the same being at
most but her receipt or admission, affording only evidence of no
very great weight, under the circumstances proved before the
master, of the matters therein admitted.
6. In taking his account as executor, the paper writing bearing
date in the year 1847, signed by William D. Cooke. which was
not pleaded nor set up in the answer, ought not to be regarded
as a stated account, conclusive of all matters of account between
the said Thomas and the said Frances, before and including the
twenty-first day of June, 1847, the same being, at most, only
an admission by her agent, never intended as a memorial of,
nor founded upon, an actual accounting by said Thomas.
Mr. Samuel P. Phillips for the appellants.
Mr. A. S. Merrimon, contra.
MR. JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.

It is a common remark, that, when interpreting a will, the
attending circumstances of the testator, such as the condition
of his family, and the amount and character of his property,
may and ought to be taken into consideration. The interpreter
may place himself in the position occupied by the testator when
he made the will, and from that standpoint discover what was
intended. Brown v. Thorndike, 15 Pick. (Mass.) 388; 1]ostlethwaite's Appeal, 68 Pa. St. 477; Smith v. Bell, 6 Pet. 68.
Such a method of procedure is, we think, appropriate to the
present case.
Mrs. Devereux's will was made on the twenty-third day of
December, 1847, about eighteen months before her death.
There is no reason to believe there was any essential change
in the nature or the amount of her property between the date
of her making the will and her decease, and it may fairly be
assumed that what she had in June, 1849, the time of her

Oct. 1878.]

BLAKE

v.

death, she had when she made her testamentary disposition.
At that time her personal property consisted of her household
furniture, her carriage and horses, a growing crop upon a farm
she was cultivating jointly with her grandson John Devereux,
a small sum of cash in hand, some petty debts due to her, and
about sixty slaves. The slaves, as appears in a subsequent appraisement, constituted the principal part in value, very nearly,
if not quite, nine-tenths of the whole. Iii addition to this, she
owned a house and lot in Chapel Hill, which she directed to be
sold; and she had a power to appoint the unappropriated balance of a fund of $50,000 then in the hands of her son, Thomas
P. Devereux. Such was the property of which she attempted
to make a disposition. Her will commenced with a declaration
of her intention "thereby to execute all powers vested in (her)
and enacted in any deed or deeds theretofore executed, particularly- those powers created in her favor by two certain deeds
settling and assuring the estate of her late brother, George Pollock, to (her) son, Thomas P. Devereux, dated some time in the
month of July, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and
thirty-nine, and executed by her late husband and herself." This
was followed by her testamentary dispositions. By the first five
she gave five legacies of $4,000 each to five several charitable
institutions, to each an equal sum. By the sixth item she bequeathed $500 to her executors for- a charitable purpose. By
the eighth she bequeathed $7,500 to her son, Thomas P. Devereux, to apply the income annually to the payment of certain
annuities and charities therein specified; and by the, twelfth
item she bequtathed $500 for another specified charity. The
will contains no other gifts of pecuniary legacies. The aggregate of these is $28,500. _ Special dispositions are made of her
slaves, horses, cattle, hogs, crops, and farming utensils, and of
the proceeds of the sale of her house and lot in Chapel Hill,
generally, indeed, of all that she possessed in her own right.
Whether this will was an execution of the power reserved to
her by the deed to her son, referred to in the introductory
clause, - whether it was an appointment of so much of the
sum of $50,000 made subject to her appointment by the deed,
as remained undisposed of by her, is the most important question we have now to consider. It must be admitted that the

BLAKE V. HAWKINS.

[Sup. Ct.

avowal by the testatrix in the introductory clause of her will
of her purpose thereby to execute the power was not itself an
execution. It is important only as it may shed light upon the
subsequent dispositions. A previously expressed intention may
serve to explain language afterwards used, and show what its
meaning is; but it is one thing to intend a future act, and quite
another to carry out that intention. While it is true that
whether a power has been executed or not is a question involving a consideration of the intent of the donee of the power,
it is equally true the intention must be found in the acts or
dispositions of the donee, and not alone in any previously expressed purpose. Prior to the English Statute of Wills (1 Vict.
c. 26), - which, so far as it relates to appointments by will,
has been enacted in North Carolina,
certain things had been
generally accepted as indicative of an intention to execute a
power, and as sufficient indications. As expressed in repeated
decisions, these were: first, some reference to the power in the
will or other instrument; second, some reference to the power
or subject over which the power extends; and, third, where the
provisions of the will or other instrument executed by the donee
of the power would be ineffectual or a mere nullity, or would
have no operation if not an execution of the power. The first
of these indications, however, must be understood as a reference to the power in the dispositions actually made. In Lowson
v. Lowson (3 Bro. C. C. 272), a will expressed to have been made
in pursuance of a power which the testator had, was held by the
Lord Chancellor not to have been an execution thereof, because
the subsequent dispositions were apparently applicable only to
his own estate. It may be remarked that Sir Edward Sugden
expresses doubts of the correctness of this decision, for the
reasons given by Lord Thurlow; but he still lays down the
rule, that "although a will be expressed to be made in pursuance of the power, yet if the testator appears to dispose of his
own property only, the power will not be executed by the
will." Sugden, Powers (2d Am. ed.), 364. On the other hand,
if the will contains no expressed intent to exert the power, yet
if it may reasonably be gathered from the gifts and directions
made that their purpose and object were to execute it, the
will must be regarded as an execution. After all, an appoint-

Oct. 1878.]

BLAKE V. HAWKINS.

ment under a power is an intent to appoint carried out, and if
made by will, the intent and its execution are to be sought for
through the whole instrument.
Turning now to the will we have before us, two things are
evident. The first is, that the testatrix did not intend that the
pecuniary legacies given for charitable purposes, and to pay
annuities, should be satisfied out of her own personal property; and the second is, that she did intend that those legacies
should be paid. Substantially all her own property she devoted to other uses. Her horses, cattle, hogs, &c., crops and
farming utensils, her carriage, wagon, and all personal property except negroes, in the possession of her grandson, John
Devereux, she directed to be sold, and the proceeds applied to
the payment of her debts; and she appears to have doubted
whether they would be sufficient. Her house and lot in Chapel
Hill she ordered to be sold, and directed the sum paid for it
to be invested in some productive stock, ordering, however, a
payment out of it, and out of the funds arising from the sale
of some negroes, to satisfy an annuity of $150 during a life
or lives. By these specific appropriations she negatived any
right to apply these funds to the payment of the pecuniary
legacies mentioned in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth,
sixth, eighth, and twelfth items in the will. Nothing of her
own personal property, of any considerable value, remained,
except her slaves. Six of them she specifically bequeathed.
One she ordered to be sold, devoting the proceeds to the distribution of tracts and religious books, and three others were
directed to be sold at private sale, and a portion of the avails,
if not all, she appropriated to the.payment of an annuity. The
remainder of her slaves she provided might be taken at a valuation by her son-in-law and grandson, upon their giving bonds
for payment of the appraised value in ten annual instalments.
These bonds, of course, could not be applied to the discharge of
the pecuniary legacies as they fell due. Thus it appears that
while she gave pecuniary legacies amounting in the aggregate
to more than $28,000, she carefully withdrew from any positive
application to their payment the personal estate she owned in
her own right. It seems necessarily to follow that, if she intended those legacies to be paid at all, she intended them to

[Slip. Ct.

be paid out of the fund over which she had the power of appointment. This appears from the testamentary dispositions
themselves, independent of any reference to the intention to
execute her power, avowed in the introductory clause in the
will. And that avowal tends to support the conclusion. It
is significant, also, that after she had made a specific disposition of all her own property inconsistent with any application
of it to paying those legacies, she refers to their payment again,
and uses this language: "Should it appear at my decease that
the bequests exceed the amount of funds left, my will is that
the first five only shall be curtailed, until brought within the
limits of the assets." This provision was a reasonable one, in
view of the uncertainty there was in regard to the amount
remaining of the funds of which she had the power of appointment. We conclude, therefore, that Mrs. Devereux's will was
an execution of the power, and an appointment of the fund to
her executors. It converted the fund into her own estate,
at least to the extent of $28,500, if there was so much of it
remaining.
We have considered the case thus far without reference to
the North Carolina statute of 1844-45, which is similar to the
act of 1 Vict. c. 26 (Rev. Code of N. C., c. 85, sect. 5), for the
reason that it may be doubted whether that statute is aplplicable to this will. Here there is no bequest of personal property
described in a general manner, nor even a general residuary
bequest, though there are general pecuniary legacies.
Whether, if the fund which remained in the hands of
Thomas P. Devereux at the death of the testatrix had exceeded the sum required to pay the legacies given by her will, that is to say, the sum of $28,500, - the will would have been a
complete execution of the power, covering the whole fund, or
only a partial appointment of so much as was needed to pay
those legacies, it is unnecessary for us now to decide. In the
view which we take of the other questions involved in the
case, that fund had been reduced so far that there was not
more than enough remaining subject to the power to pay the
sums bequeathed by the will. The execution was therefore
complete, and it appointed the whole fund to the executors of
this will, who took it under the appointment as part of the

personal estate of the appointor. Upon this subject see MiIday v. Barnet, Law Rep. 6 Eq. 196; Hurlstone v. Asdton,
11 Jur. N. s. 724; Hawthorn v. Skedden, 3 Sm. & G. 293.
There was, therefore, error in the decree of the Circuit
Court so far as it adjudged that the testatrix, Frances Devereux,
did not appoint to her executors the fund over which she had
the power of appointment, "except so far as it is necessary to
resort to the same to pay off the pecuniary legacies bequeathed
by her in her said will, after exhausting for that purpose what
remains of her general personal assets after payment of her debts
and funeral expenses, and the costs of administering her estate."
The other questions raised by the appeal require a less
extended consideration. The Circuit Court decreed that the
" deed of explanation" executed by Mrs. Devereux in 1845
was effectual, and that its operation was to reduce the annuity
of $3,000 charged upon the lands in the deed of settlement of
1839, proportionably as she reduced the $50,000 charged by
her appointments, or outlays, so as to make the annuity in
each and every year equal to six per cent interest on so
much of said fund as remained unappropriated or unexpended
by her in each and every year respectively. This, we think,
was correct. In 1845 she was sui jurs. Her husband had
died, and she was competent to release whatever rights she
had under her deed to Thomas P. Devereux, or to appropriate
to him any portion, or even the whole, of the fund of $50,000
then remaining. The deed of settlement gave her power to
dispose of the fund, to give, grant, or direct its payment,
investment, or application, at her discretion. If, therefore,
there was no mistake in the deed, the subsequent paper ought
to be regarded as a release pro tanto of her right to the annuity,
and a partial disposition of the fund 'ver which she had the
power. If there was a mistake in the deed, it was quite competent for her to rectify it by agreement; and her "deed of
explanation" was a solemn acknowledgment under her seal of
the mistake, as effective in equity, if properly obtained, as would
have been the decree of a chancellor reforming the instrument.
We see not enough in the relation of the parties to each other
to justify any presumption that undue influence was exerted
over her. The deed of 1839 exhibits the fact that a possi-

ble benefit to her son was even then contemplated. It provided that whatever of the $50,000 fund the mother should
not dispose of should lapse for his benefit. It was quite natural, therefore, for her to execute a declaration for his relief.
What we have said disposes of the fourth assignment of
error, and shows that it is not sustained.
It is next objected by the appellants that the court erred in
directing the paper dated Oct. 20, 1846, and signed by Mrs.
Devereux, to be treated as a stated account between her and
her son, conclusive of all matters of account between them previous to and including the 22d of June, 1846, respecting the
$50,000 fund and the annuity, excepting such matters as are
by its express terms excepted out of it and reserved for future
adjustment. The paper was, in fact, an account stated by a
third person, selected by both parties, agreed to be correct by
Mrs. Devereux, except in four particulars reserved for subsequent arbitrament. It bears on its face evidence that it was
carefully examined and fully understood. After such examination it was signed, and there is no evidence that Mrs. Devereux ever afterwards questioned its correctness.
On the
contrary, she, in substance, ratified it and acknowledged its
correctness at least twice, more than a year afterwards. It is
difficult, therefore, to see why it should not be regarded as the
Circuit Court directed it to be. It is urged on behalf of the
appellants that because the statement was not pleaded, nor set
forth in the answer, the defendants were precluded from making use of it when ordered to account. This is overlooking the
fact that it was not a bar to all claim for an account. Thomas
P. Devereux's liability to account, if it existed at all, continued
after the statement was made, to the extent of all subsequent
transactions, and for the balance ascertained by it to be due
June 22, 1846. It is not set up as a full accounting, but as a
partial settlement. It would have been no answer to the
complainant's bill if Thomas P. Devereux had said, I have
accounted up to June 22, 1846. He denied his liability to
account at all; and it was only when that was adjudged against
him that he could avail himself of the fact that he had partially accounted, and that fact he could use only in stating the
account ordered. We may add that we see nothing in the

circumstances attending the statement sufficient to cast suspicion upon it, or to call upon the defendants to support it by
extraneous proofs. The relation between Mrs. Devereux and
her son, created by the deed of 1839, was more like that of
debtor and creditor than that of trustee and cestui que trust.
It was no relation of confidence reposed. Similar remarks
may be made respecting the second statement, which ascertained the balance due from June 21,1847. The decree of the
court respecting its effect was right.
The remaining exception to the decree of the court is that
it denied the liability of Thomas P. Devereux to account, as
executor of the last will and testament of Mrs. Devereux, for
"all her personal estate, especially for so much as came into
the hands of Seymour W. Whiting as administrator pendente
lite or cum testamento annexo." We think this part of the
decree -was correct. He was required to account for all the
estate that came to his hands; and correctly so required, for he
had made himself an executor de son tort by intermeddling
with the estate of the testatrix, and by taking most of it into
his possession, and undertaking to dispose of it. But he never
qualified as executor of the will, or administrator eum testamento annexo, nor was he even administrator pendente lite.
As such, therefore, he did not become responsible, and as
executor de son tort he was only liable for what came into his
hands. MitchelZ v. .lunt, 4 Mass. 653; Kinard v. Young,
2 Rich. (S. C.) Eq. 247; Leach v. House, 1 Bailey (S. C.),
42. This is clear, upon both reason and authority.
Our conclusion, therefore, is, after reviewing the -whole case,
that there has been no error committed, except the single one
which we first noticed. For that, however, the decree of the
Circuit Court must be reversed, and the case sent back with
instructions to direct a new accounting, and to enter a decree
in conformity with this opinion; and it is
So ordered.
