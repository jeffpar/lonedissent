UNITED STATES V. THROCKMIORTON.

A title which cannot be made good otherwise may be made
so by the ]apse of time or the Statute of Limitations. Is the
vendor to wait until this shall occur? and, in the mean time,
can the vendee, or those claiming under him, remain in possession and enjoy all the fruits of the contract, and pay neither
principal nor interest to the vendor?
Chancellor Kent well says, "It would lead to the greatest
inconvenience, and perhaps abuse, if a purchaser in the actual
possession of land, and when no third person asserts or takes
any measures to assert a hostile claim, can be permitted, on a
suggestion of a defect or failure of title, and on the principle of
quia timet, to stop the payment of the purchase-money, and of
all proceedings at law to recover it." Abbott v. Allen, supra.

Decree affirmed.

UNITED STATES v. THROCXMORT01.
1. It is essential to a bill in chancery on behalf of the United States to set aside
a patent for lands, or the final confirmation of a Mexican grant, that it
shall appear in some way, without regard to the special form, that the
Attorney-General has brought it himself, or given such authority for bringing it as will make him officially responsible therefor through all stages
of its presentation.
2. The frauds for which a bill to set aside a judgment or a decree between the
same parties, rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, will be sustained,
are those which are extrinsic or collateral to the matter tried, and not a
fraud which was in issue in the former suit.
3. The cases where such relief has been granted are those in which, by fraud
or deception practised on the unsuccessful party, he has been prevented
from exhibiting fully his case, by reason of which there has never been a
real contest before the court of the subject-matter of the suit.
4. The Circuit Court of the United States has now no original jurisdiction to
reform surveys made by the land department of confirmed Mexican grants
in California.

the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of California.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

v.

THROCKMORTON.

[Sup. Ct.

delivered the opinion of the court.
In this case a bill in chancery is brought in the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of California, to use
the language of the bill itself, "by Walter Van Dyke, United
States attorney for that district, on behalf of the United
States," against Throckmorton, Howard, Goold, and Haggin.
The object of the bill is to have a decree of the court, setting
aside and declaring to be null and void a confirmation of the
claim of W. A. Richardson under a Mexican grant, to certain
lands, made by the board of commissioners of private landclaims in California on the twenty-seventh day of December,
1853; and the decree of the District Court of the United States,
made Feb. 11, 1856, affirming the decree of the commissioners,
and again confirming Richardson's claim. The general ground
on which this relief is asked is that both these decrees were
obtained by fraud.
The specific act of fraud which is mainly relied on to support the bill is, that after Richardson had filed his petition
before the board of commissioners, with a statement of his
claim and the documentary evidence of its validity, March 16,
1852, he became satisfied that he had no sufficient evidence of
an actual grant or concession to sustain his claim, and with a
view to supply this defect, he made a visit to Mexico, and
obtained from Micheltorena, former political chief of California, his signature, on or about the first day of July, 1852,
to a grant which was falsely and fraudulently antedated, so
as to impose on the court the belief that it was made at a
time when Micheltorena had power to make such grants in
California; and it is alleged that in support of this simulated
and false document he also procured and filed therewith the
depositions of perjured witnesses.
There is much verbiage, repetition, and argumentative matter in the bill; but no allegation whatever that any of the
attorneys, agents, or other officers of the government were false
in their duty to it, or that they assisted or connived at the
fraud, unless a single allegation on that subject, which will
be hereafter considered, sufficiently makes such charge. For
the present, it will be assumed that no such charge is made.
While the bill is elaborate in its statement of matters which
MR. JUSTICE MILLER

are supposed to impeach the decree, and is correspondingly
silent as to any thing tending to its support, there are important facts which, it cannot escape attention, could not be
omitted. Among these is, that, in attempting to negative the
idea that juridical possession of the land was ever delivered
to Richardson by the Mexican authorities, it is incidentally
admitted that at the time the transaction occurred on which
his claim is founded, he was in actual possession and residing
on part, if not all, of the land in controversy. So, also, it is
tacitly admitted that the archives of the Mexican government,
turned over to the office of the United States surveyor-general,
and original documents produced by Richardson, showed an
espediente which was sufficient to establish the claim, except
for thbe want of the final concession. It is, therefore, to be
taken as true that Richardson, being on the land prior to 1838,
made his petition to the governor for a grant of this land,
which was appropriately referred for information, and that the
proper report was had that there was no objection to the grant.
According to Mexican law, but two things remained to perfect
the title; namely, a grant or concession by the governor, and
the delivery of juridical possession. The latter has never been
held by this court as indispensable to a confirmation of the
grant, and least of all when the party was already in possession,
which he had held for many years. It is also important to
observe that the original petition was filed before the board,
March 16, 1852, and its decree was rendered Dec. 27, 1853;
that an appeal was taken to the District Court, where the
case remained until Feb. 11, 1856, when it was affirmed;
that an appeal was again taken to the Supreme Court of the
United States, which was dismissed by order of the AttorneyGeneral on the second day of April, 1857. The case was
pending in litigation, therefore, more than five years before
the decree became final, and more than four years after the
alleged fraudulent grant by Micheltorena was filed in the case.
It is also to be observed that the necessity of such a paper to
the support of Richardson's claim had been made obvious to
the board of commissioners, to the claimant himself, and to the
attorneys representing the government, by the report of the
surveyor-general, that while every thing else seemed right in

UNITED STATES V. THROCKMORTON.

[Sup. Ct.

his office, the important final decree of concession was not
there. The attention, therefore, of all the parties and of the
court must have been drawn to a close scrutiny of any proceeding to supply this important document.
There was also ample time to make all necessary inquiries
and produce the necessary proof, if it existed, of the fraud.
The allegation of the bill is that this simulated concession
was filed with the board of commissioners in January, 1853,
and the decree rendered on December 27, thereafter. The
appeal was pending after this in the District Court over two
years; and after the final decree in that court it remained
under the consideration of the Attorney-General another year,
when he authorized the dismissal of the appeal. The case,
then, unless these officers neglected their duties, underwent
the scrutiny of two judicial tribunals and of the AttorneyGeneral of the United States, as well as of his subordinate in
the State of California, and was before them for a period of
five years of litigation.
The bill in this case is filed May 13, 1876, more than twenty
years after the rendition of the decree which it seeks to annul.
During that time Richardson, the claimant, and the man who
is personally charged with the guilt of the fraud, has died;
his heirs, who with himself were claimants in the suit, are not
made parties, and the land has passed from his ownership to
that of the present defendants by purchase and conveyance.
It is true that the defendants are charged in general terms
with being purchasers with notice.
It is true that the United States is not bound by the Statute
of Limitations, as an individual would be. And we have not
recited any of the foregoing matters found in the bill as sufficient of itself to prevent relief in a case otherwise properly
cognizable in equity. But we think these are good reasons
why a bill which seeks under these circumstances to annul a
decree thus surrounded by every presumption -which should
give it support, shall present on its face a clear and unquestionable ground on which the jurisdiction it invokes can rest.
Let us inquire if this has been done.
There is no question of the general doctrine that fraud
vitiates the most solemn contracts, documents, and even judg-

ments. There is also no question that many rights originally
founded in fraud become - by lapse of time, by the difficulty of proving the fraud, and by the protection which the
law throws around rights once established by formal judicial
proceedings in tribunals established by law, according to the
methods of the law - no longer open to inquiry in the usual
and ordinary methods. Of this class are judgments and decrees of a court deciding between parties before the court and
subject to its jurisdiction, in a trial which has presented the
claims of the parties, and where they have received the consideration of the court.
There are no maxims of the law more firmly established, or
of more value in the administration of justice, than the two
which are designed to prevent repeated litigation between the
same parties in regard to the same subject of controversy;
namely, interest rei publicce, ut sit finis litium, and nemo debet
bis vexari pro una et eadam ca.usa.
If the court has been mistaken in the law, there is a remedy by writ of error. If the jury has been mistaken in the
facts, the remedy is by motion for new trial. If there has
been evidence discovered since the trial, a motion for a new
trial will give appropriate relief. But all these are parts of
the same proceeding, relief is given in the same suit, and the
party is not vexed by another suit for the same matter. So in
a suit in chancery, on proper showing a rehearing is granted.
If the injury complained of is an erroneous decision, an appeal
to a higher court gives opportunity to correct the error. If
new evidence is discovered after the decree has become final, a
bill of review on that ground may be filed within the rules
prescribed by law on that subject. Here, again, these proceedings are all part of the same suit, and the rule framed for
the repose of society is not violated.
But there is an admitted exception to this general rule in cases
where, by reason of something done by the successful party to
a suit, there was in fact no adversary trial or decision of the
issue in the case. Where the unsuccessful party has been prevented from exhibiting fully his case, by fraud or deception
practised on him by his opponent, as by keeping him away
from court, a false promise of a compromise; or where the

defendant never had knowledge of the suit, being kept in ignorance by the acts of the plaintiff ; or where an attorney fraudulently or without authority assumes to represent a party and
connives at his defeat; or where the attorney regularly employed corruptly sells out his client's interest to the other side,
these, and similar cases which show that there has never
been a real contest in the trial or hearing of the case, are
reasons for which a new suit may be sustained to set aside and
annul the former judgment or decree, and open the case for a
new and a fair hearing. See Wells, Res Adjudicata, sect. 499;
Pearce v. Olney, 20 Conn. 544; Tfierich v. De Zoya, 7 Ill. 385 ;
Kent v. Ricards, 3 Md. Ch. 392; Smith v. Lowry, 1 Johns.
(N. Y.) Ch. 320; De Louis et al. v. Meek et al., 2 Iowa, 55.
In all these cases, and many others which have been examined, relief has been granted, on the ground that, by some
fraud practised directly upon the party seeking relief against
the judgment or decree, that party has been prevented from
presenting all of his case to the court.
On the other hand, the doctrine is equally well settled that
the court will not set aside a judgment because it was founded
on a fraudulent instrument, or perjured evidence, or for any
matter which was actually presented and considered in the
judgment assailed. Mr. Wells, in his very useful work on
Res Adjudicata, says, sect. 499: " Fraud vitiates every thing,
and a judgment equally with a contract; that is, a judgment obtained directly by fraud, and not merely a judgment
founded on a fraudulent instrument; for, in general, the court
will not go again into the merits of an action for the purpose of detecting and annulling the fraud." . . . "Likewise,
there are few exceptions to the rule that equity will not
go behind the judgment to interpose in the cause itself, but
only when there was some hindrance besides the negligence of
the defendant, in presenting the defence in the legal action.
There is an old case in South Carolina to the effect that fraud
in obtaining a bill of sale would justify equitable interference
as to the judgment obtained thereon. But I judge it stands
almost or quite alone, and has no weight as a precedent." . The
case he refers to is Crauford v. Crauford, 4 Desau. (S. C.)
176. See also Bigelow on Fraud, 170-172.

Oct. 1878.]

UNITED STATES v. THROCKmORTON.

The principle and the distinction here taken was laid down as
long ago as the year 1702 by the Lord Keeper in the High
Court of Chanucery, in the case of Tovey v. Young, Pr. Ch. 193.
This was a bill in chancery brought by an unsuccessful party
to a suit at law, for a new trial, which was at that time a very
common mode of obtaining a new trial. One of the grounds
of the bill was that complainant had discovered since the trial
was had that the principal witness against him was a partner
in interest with the other side. The Lord Keeper said: "New
matter may in some cases be ground for relief, but it must not
be what was tried before ; nor, when it consists in swearing only,
will I ever grant a new trial, unless it appears by deeds, or
writing, or that a witness on whose testimony the verdict was
given was convicted of perjury, or the jury attainted." The
case seems to have been well considered, for the decree was a
confirmation of one made by the Master of the Rolls.
The case of Smith v. Lowry (supra) was also a bill for a new
trial, on the ground that the witness on whose testimony the
amount of damages was fixed was suborned by the plaintiff,
and that complainant had learned since the trial that a fictitious sale of salt had been made for the purpose of enabling
this witness to testify to the market price. Chancellor Kent
said that complainant must have known, or he -was bound to
know, that the price of salt at the place of delivery would be
a matter of inquiry at the trial; and he dismissed the bill for
want of equity, citing the case of Tovey v. Young with approval.
And he cites a number of cases to show that chancery will not
interfere though new evidence has been discovered since the
trial, which, if the party could have introduced it, would have
changed the result.
In Bateman v. Willoe (1 Scho. & Lef. 201), Lord Redesdale said: "I do not know that equity ever does interfere to
grant a trial of a matter which has already been discussed in a
court of law, a matter capable of being discussed there, and over
which the court of law had full jurisdiction." The rule must
apply with equal force to a bill to set aside a decree in equity
after it has become final, where the object is to retry a matter
which was in issue in the first ease and was matter of actual
contest.

UNITFD STATES V. THROCKMORTON.

[,SUll. Ct.

The same doctrine is asserted in -Dixon v. Graham, 16 Iowa,
310 ; Cottle v. Cole & Cole, 20 id. 482; Borland v. Thornton,
12 Cal. 440; Riddle et al. v. Baker et al., 18 id. 295; Railroad
Company v. Neal, 1 Wood, 853.
But perhaps the best discussion of the whole subject is to be
found in Greene v. Greene (2 Gray (Mass.), 361), where the
opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Shaw. That was a
bill filed by a woman against her husband for a divorce. The
husband had five years before obtained a decree of divorce
against her. In her bill she alleges that the former decree was
obtained by fraud, collusion, and false testimony, and she prays
that this may be inquired into, and the decree set aside. The
court was of opinion that this allegation meant that the husband colluded or combined with other persons than complainant to obtain false testimony, or otherwise to aid him in
fraudulently obtaining the decree. The Chief Justice says
that the court thinks the point settled against the complainant by authority, not specifically in regard to divorce,
but generally as to the conclusiveness of judgments and decrees
between the same parties. He then examines the authorities,
English and American, and adds: " The maxim that fraud
vitiates every proceeding must be taken, like other general
maxims, to apply to cases where proof of fraud is admissible.
But where the same matter has been actually tried, or so in
issue that it might have been tried, it is not again admissible; the party is estopped to set up such 'fraud, because the
judgment is the highest evidence, and cannot be contradicted."
It is otherwise, he says, with a stranger to the judgment.
This is said in a case where the bill was brought for the purpose of impeaching the decree directly, and not where it was
offered in evidence collaterally. We think these decisions
establish the doctrine on which we decide the present case;
namely, that the acts for which a court of equity will on
account of fraud set aside or annul a judgment or decree,
between the same parties, rendered by a court of competent
jurisdiction, have relation to frauds, extrinsic or collateral, to
the matter tried by the first court, and not to a fraud in the
matter on which the decree was rendered.
That the mischief of retrying every case in which the judg-

ment or decree rendered on false testimony, given by perjured
witnesses, or on contracts or documents whose genuineness or
validity -was in issue, and which are afterwards ascertained
to be forged or fraudulent, would be greater, by reason of the
endless nature of the strife, than any compensation arising from
doing justice in individual cases.
The case before us comes within this principle. The genuineness and validity of the concession from Micheltorena produced by complainant was the single question pending before
the board of commissioners and the District Court for four years.
It was the thing, and the only thing, that was controverted, and
it was essential to the decree. To overrule the demurrer to
this bill would be to retry, twenty years after the decision of
these tribunals, the very matter which they tried, on the ground
of fraud in the document on which the decree was made. If we
can do this now, some other court may be called on twenty
years hence to retry the same matter on another allegation of
fraudulent combination in this suit to defeat the ends of justice;
and so the number of suits would be without limit and the
litigation endless about the single question of the validity of
this document.
We have alluded to an allegation concerning the agent representing the United States before the board of commissioners.
The substance of it is that Howard, one of the present defendants, then the law agent of the government before the
board, bad, from the papers in some other suit, derived notice
of the fraudulent character of the Micheltorena grant, and that
he failed and neglected to inform the commissioners of the fact,
or otherwise to defend the interest of the United States in the
matter. If there had been a further allegation that Howard
-was then interested in the Richardson claim, or that Richardson
had bribed him, or that from any corrupt motive he had betrayed the interest of the government, the case would have
come within the rule which authorizes relief. But nothing of
the kind is alleged ;' and the statement is a mere charge of carelessness or negligence on the part of the attorney for the government, which would not have supported a motion for a new
trial in a case at law at the same term, much less a suit in
chancery to set aside a decree twenty years after it had been
rendered.

UNITED STATES v. TiiROCK3ORTON.

[Sup. Ct.

Nor is there any such clear statement of the notice which
Howard had as is necessary to establish his negligence.

In fact, one great if not fatal defect in the bill is the absence
of any declaration of the means by which the fraud has been
discovered or can be now established.
There is another objection to the bill which, though not
going to the merits, is, in our opinion, equally fatal to it in its
present shape.
We are of opinion that, unless by virtue of an act of Congress, no one but the Attorney-General, or some one authorized
to use his name, can bring a suit to set aside a patent issued by
the United States, or a judgment rendered in its courts on which
such a patent is founded.
That is the case before us, and we see nothing in the bill to
indicate to the court that it ever received the sanction of the
Attorney-General, or was brought by his direction. The allegation already cited implies that Mr. Van Dyke, the district
attorney, is the complainant; but if, construing it liberally, we
hold that the United States is the complainant, the statement
is clear that the bill was brought by the district attorney, and
not by the Attorney-General. Leaving out of consideration all
mere questionr of form, there arises no presumption from the
act of Congress which gives the Department of Justice a general supervision over the district attorneys, that this suit was
brought by his direction; for they, in the strict line of their
duty, bring innumerable suits, indictments, and prosecutions,
in which the United States is plaintiff, without consulting him.
In the class of cases to which this belongs, however, the practice of the English and the Ambrican courts has been to require the name of the Attorney-General as indorsing the suit
before it will be entertained. The reason of this is obvious;
namely, that in so important a matter as impeaching the grants
of the government under its seal, its highest law officer should
be consulted, and should give the support of his name and authority to the suit. He should, also, have control of it in every
stage, so that if at any time during its progress he should
become convinced that the proceeding is not well founded, or
is oppressive, he may dismiss the bill.
There is appended to this record, though no part of it, a

Oct. 1878.]

UNITED STATES v. THROCKmORTON.

bond, given by some private persons to the United States, to
save it harmless of costs in regard to this suit. If it is intended
by this to show that the Attorney-General authorized the suit,
it fails to prove it, though the bond recites that that officer had
directed the district attorney to bring the suit.
It is not in this way that the then Attorney-General should
have placed himself on the record as responsible for such a
bill. In confirmation of this view, it does not appear that he
or his successors have ever given the slightest attention to the
case. In the argument of it before us, no officer of the government appeared. It would be a very dangerous doctrine, one
threatening the title to millions of acres of land held by patent from the government, if any man who has a grudge or a
claim against his neighbor can, by indemnifying the govern
ment for costs, and furnishing the needed stimulus to a district
attorney, institute a suit in chancery in the United States to
declare the patent void. It is essential, therefore, to such a
suit, that without special regard to form, but in some way
which the court can recognize, it should appear that the Attorney-General has brought it himself, or given such order for its
institution as will make him officially responsible for it, and
show his control of the cause.
It is unnecessary at this day to say that, as a substantive
matter, standing alone, the Circuit Court has no jurisdiction to
interfere with or relieve against a survey which, by the allegation of the bill itself, is pending before the District Court.
. For these reasons, we are of opinion that the decree of the
Circuit Court sustaining a demurrer to the bill, and dismissing
it on the merits, was right..
