SUPREME COURT.

JOIN SMITH,

T.,

APPELLANT V. THE UNITED STATES.

.John Smith, T. claimed a confirmation of a grant of land by the governor-general of
Loqisiana, made on the 11th of February 1796. Louisiana was ceded by France
to the United States by the treaty of 1803. In 1811 surveys were made under
the grant of several tracts of land, varying in numbers of acres, and several of
them including lead mines. No survey of any land was made under the grant,
until after the treaty of cession. By the decree of the district court, the claim was
rejected, and that decree was affirmed by the supreme court.
It was never doubted by this court that property of every description in Louisiana
was protected by the law of nations, the terms of the treaty, and the acts of congress; nor that in the term " property was comprehended every species of title,
inchoate or perfect; embracing those rights which lie in contracts; those which
are executory, as well as those which are executed. In this respect the relation
of the inhabitants to their government is not changed. The new government
takes the place of that which has passed away." 4 Peters 512
The act of congress of 1804, which submitted claims to land in Louisiana to judicial
cognizance, confined the court to such claims as had been legally made, granted
or issued before the 10th of March 1804, which were protected by the treaty of
1803, and-might have been perfected into a complete title under the laws, usages
and customs of Spain, if she had continued to hold the government of the province.
It was also made the duty of the court to, conduct the proceedings on all petitions
according to the rules of a court of equity, and to decide upon them according to
the principles of justice, and the laws and ordinances of the government under
which the claim originated. In thus consenting to be made defendants in equity
at the suit of every claimant for land in Missouri; the United States waived all
rights which the treaty could give them as purchasers for a valuable consideration
without notice. They bound themselves to carry into specific Execution by patent,
every grant, concession, warrant or order of survey which, before the 10th of March
1804, had created amsy legal or equitable right of property in the land so claimed;
so that in every case arising under the law, one general question was presented for
the consideration of the court: Whether, in the given case, a court of equity could,
according to its rules and the laws of Spain, consider the conscience of the king
to be so affected by his own, or the acts of the lawful authorities of the province,
that lie had become a trustee for the claimant, and held the land-claimed by an
equity upon it amounting to a severance of so much from his domain, before the
10th of March 1804, in Missouri, and the 24th of January 1818, in Florida, the
pebiods fixed by the law in one case, and the treaty in the other.
The principles which have been established by the decisions of the court, in relation
to claims to lands under grants from the crown of Spain, or the officers of Spain
authorized to make grants.
No claim to land in Missouri can be confirmed under the acts of 1824 or 1828, unless
by a grant, commission, warrant oi order of survey for some tract of land described
therein, to make it capable of some definite location, consistently with its terms,
made, granted or issued before the 10th of March 1804, or by an order to survey

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Smith v. The United States.]
any given quantity, without any description or limitation as to place, which shall
have been located, by a survey, made by a proper officer before that time.
Congress did not contemplate the submission of any claims to the court, except such
as, on confirmation, could be surveyed and patented, and on rejection would be
thenceforth held and taken to be a part of the public lands ; though cases of claims
to make a prospective severance of particular tracts from the general domain, when
the grant was wholly indefinite, would require a distinct provision. Spain never
permitted individuals to locate their grants by mere private survey. The grants
were an authority to the public surveyor or his deputy to make the survey as a
public trust, to protect the royal domain from being cut up at the pleasure of the
grantees. A grant might be directed to a private person, or a separate official order
given to make the survey; but without either, it would not be a legal execution of
the power.
The laws of the United States give no authority to an individual to survey his grant
or claim to lands; he may make lines to designate the extent and bounds of his
claim, but he can acquire no rights thereby. Neither in this, or the record of any
of the cases which have been before this court, has it seen any evidence of any law
of Spain, local regulations, law or usage, which makes a private survey operate to
sever any land from the royal domain. On the contrary, all the surveys which
have been exhibited in the cases decided, were made by the surveyor-general of the
province, his deputies, by the special order of the governor or intendant, or those
who represented them. No government gives any validity to private surveys, of its
warrants or orders of survey, and there is no reason to think that Spain was a
solitary exception, even as to the general domain, by 'grants in the ordinary mode,
for a specific quantity to be located in one place.
It is for another branch of the government to decide on the claims of the petitioner,
under the third section of the act of 1828. With that this-court have nothing to
do: its duty terminates by a decision on the validity of his title by any law, treaty
or proceedings under them, according to those principles of justice'which govern
courts of equity.

ON appeal from the district court of the United States for the district

of Missouri.
This case was argued at January term 1830 by Mr Benton for
the appellant, and by Mr Wirt, for the United States, The court
held it under advisement for the reasons stated in the case of John

.Smith,T. v. The United States, 4 Peters 511.
stated in the opinion of this court

The case is fully

Mr Justice BALDWIN delivered the opinion of the Court.

Pursuant to the provisions of the act of 1824, for the adjustment
of land claims in the state of Missouri, John Smith, T. filed his
petition in the district court on the .3d of October 1827, claiming a
confirmation of his title to ten thousand arpents of land in that state,
in virtue of a Spanish concession to James St Vrain, a resident of

. SUPREME COURT;
[Smith v. The United States.]

Louisiana, legally made before the 10th of March of J804 by the
proper authorities. He alleged that his. claim was protected by the
treaty between France and the United States for the cession of Louisiana; and might have been perfected into a complete title under the
laws, usages and customs of the government under which the same
originated, had not the sovereignty of the country been transferred
to the United States.
. His claim is founded on a petition of James St Vrain
to the governor-general of Louisiana, in November 1795, praying for a grant
in full property to him and his heirs of ten :thousand- superficial arpents of land ; with the special permission to locate in separate pieces,
upon different mines, of what nature they may be, salines, mill seats,
and any other place that shall appear suitable to his interest, without
obliging him to make a settlement; which grant as prayed for was
granted by the said governor-general'the 10th of February 1796.
He alleges that he became owner of the grant by p irchase from St
Vrain and wife before the act of 1824, and has caused several parts
.thereof to be located in Missouri, which he'specifies in the petition;
and prays that the validity of his claim may be examined 'by the
court.
On the face of:the petition, the petitioner shows a-case within the
provisions of the first section of the law of 1824; which directs the
.court to.take jurisdiction to hear and-determine it.
The petition of St Vrain to the governor-general of Louisiana
states, that misfortunes.had induced him to settle in Louisiana at St
Genevieve, where he had rendered himself useful in repressing a
certain party; that his knowledge of mineralogy had induced his
father to make over to him the contract which he had with the
government for the supply of a certain quantity of lead. To enable
him to comply with this contract, and to insure him an honourable
,existence, he pratys for a grant as specified in the petition of the appellant. At the foot of this petition there-was the following writing.
"New Orleans, 10th of February 1796. Granted.
"THE BARON DE CARONDELET."

The original petition, with this entry upon it, was produced before
the land commissioners in Missouri in 1806: the signature of the
baron was proved to be in his handwriting, and the residue to be
that of the secretary of the government. The original was lost in
1807 or 1808, but a copy certified from the land records, was produced at the hearing in the court below, and. competent evidence

JANUARY TFRM 1836.
[Smith v. The United States.]

was given of the existence and loss of the original; the district court
did not, in their decree, decide on the effect of this evidence, nor do
we think it necessary to consider it; for thi purposes of this case,
the genuineness of the grant and its loss, are assumed. On the 6th
of February 1808, St Vrain and wife, in consideration of 5000 dollars, conveyed the concession to the petitioner by deed duly record-d.
In 1811 the petitioner caused a survey of two hundred and ninetyfour arpents of land to be made by'a private surveyor, pursuant to
the concession to St Vrain ; other surveys were afterwards made in
like manner of'several tracts specified in the record, varying in quantity from one thousand two hundred to fifty arpents, several of them
including lead mines ; the ute for fifty 'acres being on a mill seat.
The claim was acted on by the United State- hnard of land commisioners in Missouri; who, in December 1811, gave their opinion that
it ought not to be confirmed. The district court of Missouri have
also rejected it by their final decree; from which the petitioner has
taken an appeal to this court, in the manner directed by the act of
1824.
At the January term in 1830, this cause, with that of Soulard,
was very ably and elaborately argued by the counsel on both sidesq:
they were the first cases which came before us since the law giving
jurisdiction to the district court of Missouri. to decide on claims to
land in that state, subject to an appeal to this court. The subject
was a new one both to the court and the bar : the titles and tenures
of land in Louisiana had never undergone a jfdicial investigation,
which could give the court such information as could lead them to
any satisfactory conclusion. Hence, and notwithstanding the full
argument in these cases; there seemed to be much matter for consideration in the developments to be'made of the laws, usages and
customs of Spain, in relation to grants of land in Louisiana. These
cases were held under advisement.
At the next term, finding that appeals had been made in cases
from Florida, arising under a law authorizing a judicial decision on
claims to land in that territory, on the consideration of which the
whole subject of Spanish titles would be thoroughly examined, these
causes were further postponed till the ensuing term. One of the
Florida cases was then decided oh principles which did not apply to
them; and it was thought that still further information must be pre.
sented in some of the numerous cases before us for final adjudication,
VOL. x.-2 R

SUPREME COURT.
[Smith v. The United States.]

and a furiher'postponement was therefore deemedt'advisable. At
each successive term since, it has been our duty to decide on claims
to land under the government of Spain, if not in all the aspects in
which they can be presented, at least in those sufficiently varied as
to enable us to decide this case on principles entirely satisfactory to
ourselves. It was never doubted by this court that property of every
description'in Louisiana was protected by the law of nations, the terms
of the treaty and the acts of congress ; nor that in the term "property
was comprehended every species of title, inchoate or perfect, embracing those rights which lie in contracts; those which are executory,
as well as those which are executed. In this respect the relation of the
inhabitants to their government is not changed. The new government
takes the place of that which lhas passed away " 4 Peters 512. Such,
in 1830, was our general view of the Missouri cases. Our difficulty
was in ascertaining the powers of the governor-g neral, of the intendant and his sub-delegates, and the local governors or commandants of posts to make grants of ldnds ; what acts by either operated
by way of grant, concession, warrant or order of survey;*so as to sever
any portion of land from the royal domain, and create in it a right
of property in an. individual. The law submitting claims of either
of these four descriptions to judicial cognizance, confined the court
to such as had been legally made, granted or issued before the 10th
of March 1804, which were protected by the treaty of 1803, and
might have been perfected into a complete title under the laws,
usages, and customs of Spain, if she had continued to hold the government of the province.
It was also made the duty of the court to conduct the proceedings
on'all petitions according to the rules of a court of equity ; and to
decide upon them according to the principles of justice, and the laws
and ordinances of the government under which the claim originated.
In thus consenting to be made defendants in equity at the suit of
every claimant for land in Missouri, the United States waived all
rights which the treaty could give them as purchasers for avaluable
consideration without notice. They bound themselves to carry into
specific execution by patent every grant, concession, warrant or order
of survey which, before the 4th of Match 1804, had created any
legal or equitable right of property in the land so claimed ; so that
in every case arising under the law one 'general questioim was presented for the consideration of the court: Whether in the given

JANUARY TERM 1836,
[Smith v. The United States.]

case,.a court of equity could, according to its rules and the laws of
Spain, consider the conscience of the king to be so affected by his
own, or the acts of the lawful authorities of the province, that he
had becoie a trustee for the claimant, and held the land claimed by
an equity upon it amounting to a severance of so mnch from his domain ; before the 10th of March 1804, ini Missouri, and the 24th of
January 1818, in Florida; the periods fixed by the law in one case,
and the treaty in the other.
In all our adjudications on either class of cases, we have considered
the term lawful authorities to refer to the local governors, intendants,
or their deputies ; the laws and ordinances of Spain, as composed of
royal orders, of those of the local authorities, and the usage and
custom of the provinces, respectively, under Spain ; that any inchoate or perfect title, so made, granted or issued, is legally made by
the proper authorities. We have as uniformly held, that in ascertaining what titles would have been perfected if no cession had been
made to the United States, we must refer to the general course of
the law of Spain, to local usage and custom; and not to what might
have been, or would have been done by the special favour, or arbitrary power of the king or his officers. It has also been distinctly
decided, in the Florida cases, that the land claimed must have been"
severed from the general domain-of the king, by some grant which
gives it locality by its'terms, by a ref-rence to some description, or
by a vague general grant, with an authority to locate afterwards by
survey making it definite ; 'which grant or authority to locate must
have beenmade before the 24(h of January 1818. That where
the grant is descriptive, a survey in any other place is unauthorized:
and that-where a survey was made of part of a descriptive grant
before that time, an order or permission to survey the residue elsewhere, made afterwards, is void, in contravention of the terms of the
treaty and the act of congress; it being in effect and substance a
new grant, made after the power of the governor to make grants had
ceased. That where the grant was specific, a survey might be made
after the time fixed by the treaty ; and where the grant was vague,
or contained an authority to locate, which was' executed by a survey
made before, it was valid. United States v. Clarke, 8 Peters 466,
467.
The same principles apply to the cases in Missouri; between which
and those from Florida, there is (generally speaking) no other differ-

SUPREME COURT.
[Smith v. The United States.]

ence than that as to the latter, the treaty annuls all claims acquired
after the 24th of January 1818; while the act of 1824 limits the
jurisdiction of the court to cases of claims made in virtue of grants,
&c. made before the-10th of March 1804. This limitation on the
power of the court as e~ffctually prohibits their confirmation of grants,
&c. subsequently made, or tides acquired, as if they had been declared
void by the terms of the law, or the Louisiana treaty.
In his petition to the governor-general, St Vrain asks for a grant
infull property, of ten thousand arpents, to be located at his pleasure
as to-place, time or quantity: it, was considered by him as authorizing locations throughout Louisiana, not only while under the
government of Spain, but after its cession to the United States, and
its division into the two territories of Orleans and Missouri.. So it
was considered by the petitioner Smith, after he purchased from and
held under St Vrain; and such appears t6 be the true construction of
the petition. - The grant is contained in the one word granted, which
must be referred to every thing prayed for in the petition ; its object
was not to obtain.P. grant merely in the upper province, or it would
have been addreised to the local governor: it must have been
intended to extend to both provinces, as it was addressed to the
governor-general, whose power was general over both. He, by his
grant, without qualification or restriction, has acted in the plenitude
•of his authority, which authorizes no construction that could limit it
to the upper province more than to the lower: a limitation to either
would be by an arbitrary decision, without rule ; so would any construction cutting down the cdhcession, by striking from it any right
or privilege prayed for.
This, then, was the nature and effect of the grant, to vest in the
petitioner a title in full property to all the lands in either province
containing saline, mineral, or where there were mill seats; which he
might at any time locate in quantities to suit his own pleasure, or at
any other place that might suit his interest.
When the cession of Louisiana was completed by the surrender to
the United States, the title of St Vrain remained precisely as it was
at the date of the grant in 1796: there is no evidence that he had
done, or offered to do any act, or made any claim, or demand, asserting or affirming any right under the grant. With all the ungranted
salt springs, lead mines, mill seats and valuable spots in Louisiana
at his command; he held his grant dormant in his pocket for eight
-

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Smith v. The United States.]

years under the Spanish government, without making or attempting
to make one location under it.
On the 4th of March 1804, then, no land had been granted to St
Vrain; there was not an arpent on which his right had any local
habitation : until a location was made, it was a mere authority to
locate, which he might have exercised at his pleasure, both as to.
time and place, by the agency of a public surveyor, authorized to
separate lands from the. royal domain by a survey pursuant to a
grant, warrant, or order of.survey. At the time of the cession nothing
had been so severed, either by a public or private surveyor, or any
act done by which the king could be in any way considered as a
trustee for St Vrain for any portion of the ten thousand arpents; and
there was no spot in the whole ceded tetritory in which he had, or
could claim an existing right of property. An indispensable prerequisite to such right was some act by which his grant would acquire such locality as to attach to some spot: until this was done,
the grant could by no possibility have been perfected into a complete
title. It is clear, therefore, that the integrity of the public domain
had in no way. been affected by this grant in March 1804. The only
pretence of any right was one which extended to every vacant spot
in Louisiana, to he located in future, at the option of the grantee:
it so continued till 1811, when the first location was made by the
petitioner Smith, by a private survey, on part of the lands he claims.
It is evident that he had no other right to this tract of land in March
1804, than he bad to all the vacant lands in Louisiana. Had his
claim been presented to the district court while it remained thus
indefinite and incapable 6f definition; there would have been no case
for its jurisdiction, under the act of 1824, to confirm or reject the
claim. The sixth section provides, that on the confirmation of any
claim, the surveyor should cause the land specified in the decree to
be surveyed, a plot thereof to be made, delivered to the party, and a
patent to issue therefor; if rejected, the seventh section directs, "the
land specified in such claim shall.forthwith be held -nd taken as a
part of the public lands of the United States." By the eleventh section, if the lands decreed to any claimant have been sold or disposed
of by the United States, or have not been located, the party interested
may, after the land has been offered at public sale, enter-the like
quantity of land in any land office of the state. These provisions
show clearly that congress did not contemplate the submission of any
claims to the court, except such as, on confirmation, could besur-

SUPREME COURT.
[Smith v. The United States.]

veyed and patented, and on rejection, would be thenceforth held
and taken to be a part of the public lands; though cases of claims,
to make a prospective severance of particular tracts from the general
domain, when the grant was wholly indefinite, would require a distinct provision. If confirmed, no land could be specified in the decree,
none could be surveyed ; nor could lands which never had been the
subject of specific claim, described in no grant or survey, become a
part of the public lands, within the meaning of the law after the
decree, if there had not been some assertion by the claimant of their
having been once his property, by a severance by grant. In providing
for a case where the land had not been located, it was the evident
intention to refer to grants of land by some description before the
10th of March 1804, which had not been surveyed ; it is certain that
it could.not apply to this. Should this grant be confirmed, it must
follow its tenor and purport; the decree must affirm its validity, not
merely to the quantity of land, but with the right of location according to its express terms, which gives St,Vrain the unlimited choice
of the most valutble portions of the public lands. It would be in
direct violation of those rights which constitute the great value of
the claim, which were not the quantity of land granted, but the
unlimited power of selection, to make a decree that they were secured
to him by the law of nations, the treaty and acts of congress, as
inviolable, and in the same decree to limit him to the selection of
such lands in Missouri as should have been offered at public sale,
without any bid beyond the minimum price of the public lands.
Th4b would necessarily deprive him of the very spots to which he
would be entitled under our decree,' whenever he might choose to
appropriate them by a lawful survey.
We are therefore clearly of opinion, that no claim to land in Missouri can be confirmed under the acts of 1824 or 1828, unless by a
grant, concession, warrant or order of survey for some tract of land
described therein, to make it capable of some definite location, consistently with its terms, made, 'ranted or issued before the 10th of
March 1804, or by an order to survey any given quantity, without
any description or limitation as to place, which shall have been located by a survey, made by a proper officer before that time, as was
Soulard's case. Spain never permitted individuals to locate their
grants by mere private survey. The gants were an authority to
the public surveyor or his deputy to make the survey as a public
trust, to protect the royal domain from being cut up at the pleasure

JA!NUARY TERM 1836.
[Smith v. The United States.]

of the grantees. A grant might be directed to a private person, or a
separate official order given to make the survey; but without either,
it would not be a legal execution of the power. No such survey was
made on this grant, so that it had not attached to the land claimed
at the time named in the law.
We have then to inquire, whether a private survey, made in 1811,
could be so connected with the grant of 1796, as to operate by relation to make out a title to the land claimed in March 1804.
The laws of the United States give no authority to an individual
to survey his grant or claim to lands; he may mark lines to designate the extent and bounds of his claim, but he can acquire no rights
thereby. The only effect which we can give to this private survey,
is to consider it as a selection by the petitioner of that piece of land,
as a part of what he was entitled to locate in virtue of his general
grant.
As the United States have put themselves in the place of Spain,
we must view this selection, thus made, as if Louisiana had never
been ceded to them. But neither in this, or the record of any of the
cases which have been before us, have we seen any evidence of any
law of Spain, local regulation, law or usage, which makes a private
survey operate to sever any land from the royal domain. On the
contrary, all the surveys which have been exhibited in the cases decided, were made by the surveyor-general of the province, his deputies, the special order 3f the governor or intendant, or those who
represented them. No government gives any validity to private surveys, of its warrants or orders of survey; and we have no reason to,
think that Spain was a solitary exception, even as to the general
domain, by grants in the ordinary mode, for a specific quantity, ta
be located in one place. d fortiori, where a grant, suigeneris, might
by its terms be so split up as to cover every saline, mineral and water
power site, in the whole territory. Of all others, the survey of such
a grant ought to be made by an authorized officer. If the grant was
a lawful authority for such- selections, its execution by survey ought
to be so supervised that the selections should be made in a reasonable time, quantity of land and number of spots selected
We cannot believe that Spain would have ever consented to the
exercise of such a right, by an individual, over all the most valuable
portions of her domain, when she did not permit the appropriation of
her ordinary lands to be so made ; still less, that a claim of this description would have been perfected into a complete title had she
remained in possession of Louisiana, or that it ought so to have been.

336

SUPREME COURT.,
[Smith v. The United States.]

The claim was unreasonable in its nature, excluding the government
from all control over locations made on a sweeping grant; which by
small subdivisions might be a monopoly of evely valuable spot in both
provinces. Such a grant, with such privileges, has no equity in it,
as against the government of Spain or the United States standing in
their, place. There appears no law, usage or custom to authorize it;
and it is incompatible with those rights which every government reserves to itself, of directing by its own officers the surveys of its lands,
either on specific grants or orders of survey for vacant lands.
The negative evidence in the record is also powerful to lead to the
same conclusion. The unprecedented privilege granted to St Vrai
was of immense value, if asserted in time, before other appropriations
were made of the places of which he had the right of selection, without limit; but it would become less valuable by waiting till others
had obtained grants for them. Neither he or the petitioner Smith
have in any way accounted for the delay. They have shown no
selection made, no application to a public or even private surveyor to
make any survey during the eight years which elapsed, from the
date of the, grant till the cession. The. grant does not appear to
have been recorded or entered in any Spanish office, exhibited to any
Spanish officer, or any notoriety given to it by any assertion of right
under it. .With such powerful reasons for action, it is not a harsh
construction, of this conduct of St Vrain, to attribute it to the conviction that the Spanisat authorities would not have sanctioned his
claim. The power of the governor-general being supreme, his
power would not have been invoked in vain if the grant was good;
and no officer in the province would have disobeyed his order to survey on the selections being made.
It is not for us to say what, it any, acts would have given St Yrain
an equity in any.definite piece of ground; it suffices for this case
that he had none while thecountry was under the government of
Spain, and that the petitioner Smith has acquired none since the
ocession by any acts which he has done, or caused to be done in
milking the location specified in his petition.
It is for another branch of the government to dacide on the claims
.of the petitioner, under the third section of the act of 1828. With
that we have nothing to do: our duty terminates by a decision on
the validity of his title by any law, treaty or proceedings under them,
according to those principles of justice which govern courts of equity.
Being clearly of opinion that the claim of the petitioner to any of the

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Smith v. The United States.]

land claimed by his petition is not valid, and ought not to be confi'med.

The decree of the district court is affirmed.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the district court of the United States for the districtof Missouri,
and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is ordered,
adjudged and decreed by this court, that the decree of the said district
court in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed.
