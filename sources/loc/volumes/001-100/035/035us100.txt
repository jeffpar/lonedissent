ANTOINE SOULARD'S HEIRS V. THE UNITED STATES.
A concession and survey of land in Missouri, which was granted by the lieutepant-,
governor of Upper Louisiana, before the treaty of Louisiana, confirmed; so far as
the land embraced in the same has not been sold by the United States. For the
quantity of land so sold, the owners of the concession may enter a like quantity in
any land-office in Missouri, after the same has been offered for sale.

ON appeal from the district court of the United States, for the

district of Missouri.
A petition was filed on the 22d day of August 1824, by Antoine Soulard, in the district court of the United States for the

district of Missouri, for the confirmation of a tract of land under
the authority of the act of Congress passed May 26, 1824; entititled an act enabling the claimants of lands within the limits
of the state of Missouri and territory of Arkansas, to institute

proceedings to try the validity of their claims; and stating that
on the 26th of April 1796, the lieutenant governor of upper
Louisiana, Don Zenon Trudeau, granted to.him, in consideration
of services rendered by the petitioner to the Spanish government, ten thousand arpents of land, he being then a resident of
the province, to be located on any vacant lands belonging to the
royal domain.
In pursuanance of which decree of concession and survey tle
land was located and surveyed on the river Cuivre, about
sevonty miles north of St. Louis, and about fifteen miles west of
the river Mississippi. The petition stated that no more than
2,067 i % acres are occupied under adverse title, and proved that
the title to all the land which had not been sold by the United
States should be confirmed, and that he should be allowed to locate the residue of the grant on other unsold lands belonging to
the United States.
On the 27th of March, 1825, Julie Soulard, the widow, and
Janes G., Henry G., Eliza G., and Benjamin Soulard, the children and heirs of Antoine Soulard, he having died intestate,
-were, on filing a petition in the district court, made parties to the

cause. After various proceedings in the district court, the following decree was made.
The cause coming on to be debated and heard, in the presence
of the counsel for the petitioners and of the attorney for the United States for the district of Missouri, on the petition, the answer and the testimony which is imbodied in the -recordi it appears that the petition sets forth, in substance, that some time in
the month of April, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-six,
Antoine Soulard, the ancestor of the present petitioners, being
then a resident of the province of Upper Louisiana, and surveyor-general of the same under the Spanish government, presented his petition to the then lieutenant-governor of said province,
Don Zenon Trudeau,praying a grant of a tract of ten thousand arpents of land, to be located on any vacant part of the royal domain.
That in compliance with the said petition, and in order to remnunerate the services of said petitioner, the said Don Zenon Trudeau, lieutenant-governor, did, about the time aforesaid, grant to
the said petitioner ten thousand arpents of.land, and by said decree
of concession, did order the said quantity to be located and surveyed on any part of the royal domain in said province, at the
election of said petitioner. That the said quantity of land was,
afterwards, on the twentieth day of February, one thousand eight
hundred and four, surveyed and located by the deputy-surveyor,
Don Santiago Rankin, on a vacant part of the public land, situate about fifteen miles west of the Mississippi river, and seventy
miles north of the town of St. Louis, on a branch of the river
Cuivre, and bounded as follons: commencing at a point in the
northeast quarter of section twenty-five, township fifty-one north,.
range three west ; runs thence north sixty-eight cast, three hundred and seventeen chains eight links, to a point in the northeast quarter of section fourteen, township fifty-one north, range
two west; thence north twenty-two west, two hundred and fourteen chains and sixteen links, to a point in the southeast quarter
of section thirty-four, township fifty-two north, range two west;
thence south sixty-eight west, three hundred and seventeen
chains and eight links, to a point in the southeast quarter of section eleven, township fifty-one north,.range three west; thence
south twenty-two east, two hundred and fourteen chains sixteen

links, to the place of beginning.. And that a certificate of said
survey was'duly made and recorded in the book .of record of
surveys kept by the said petitioner as surveyor as aforesaid.
That before the time when claims should have been filed pursuant to the act of Congress of the second'. March, one thousand
eight hundred and five, the said decree of concession and certificate of survey were, by mistake, thrown into the fire and destroyed. That in consequence of the destruction of said concescession and certificate of survey, the said petitioner considered
that he was excluded from the benefit of the act. of Congress
passed for the relief of land claimants, and omitted to file any notice of his claim, and has, thereby, been deprived of the benefit of the laws heretofore passed by Congress. 'That of the said
tract of land, one thousand nine hundred and forty-seven acres
and thirty-five hundreds of an acre, have been sold by the United States, and that the residue of the said tract is not claimed
or possessed by any person other than the petitionei. And that the
same has been reserved from public sale 'until the final adjudication thereon by the proper tribunal. The petitioner prays that
the validity of his said claim may be inquired into and decided,
and that his claim and title may be confirmed to all- that part of
the said tract which has not been sold as aforesaid by the United
States, and that, he be authorized. to enter, in any of the land
offices in the state of Missouni, the quantity of one thousand nine
hundred and forty-seven acres and thirty-five hundreths of an
acre of land, the quantity sold as aforesaid by the United States.
it appears, also, that on' he seventeeth day of-March, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five, Julie Soulard, widow of the
said petitioner, and James G. Soulard, Henry G. Soulard, Eliza
Soulard, and Benjamin A. Souiard, children and heirs at law of
the said petitionier, filed their petition setting forth that the said
Antoine Soulard, after having filed and prosecuted his said petition, died, leaving the said widow- and children his only heirs
and legal representatives; and praying that the said cause might
be revived and stand in their names against the.United States;
and the attorney of the United States freely admittiotg all the
facts set forth in the petition of the said widow andclildren, the
said cause was revived accordingly.

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Soulard v. The United States.]

And it also appearing that the answer of the attorney of the
United States sets forth, in substance, that he is wholly uninformed of all the matters and things in the said petition of Antoine Soulard, revived as aforesaid contained, and, therefore, that
he does not admit the same to be true, and that he prays the court
that the said petitioners may be held and required to prove all
such facts, matters, and things, the existence whereof is, or may
be deemed nacessary to the confirmation of the said claim. And,
moreover, that the -said petitioners may be required and compelled to produce and show to the court the law, usage, or custoln, by force and virtue whereof the said claim can or ought to
be confirmed. And it further appearing, by the finding of the
jury empannelled to try the issue directed in this cause, that such
concession was made to the said Antoine Soulard, as in the said
petition is stated. And it also appearing in evidence offered on
the part of the said petitioners, that a survey of the said land was
made, and a plat thereof recorded, as in the said petition is stated. And that it was the practice of the lieutenant-governor of
upper Louisiana to make- concessions of land in virtue of their
office, as such governors, and not in virtue of any commission
as sub-delegate. And after debate of the matters aforesaid, and
the court having inquired into the validity of the title of the
said petitioners; and for that it appears to the court that no
grant of the king's domain could have been legally made, unless
made in virtue of some law or authority from him. And for that
the regulations of Count O'Reily, of the eighteenth of February,
in the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy; and of
governor Gayoso, of the ninth of September, one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-seven; and of Morales, the intendant, of
the seventeenth of July, one thousand seven hundred -and ninety-nine, exhibit- a general intention and policy on the part of the
Spanish government, in relation to the disposition of the public
domain, which excludes every reasonable supposition of the existence of any law, usage, or custom, under and in conformity
to which the alleged concession might have been perfected into
a complete title, had not the sovereignty of the country been
transferiaed to the United States, and for the principles, commands,
and prohibitions in those regulations contained, are not to be re-

SUPREME COURT.
[Soulard v. The United States.]

conciled with-any idea of the legality of the said concession, and
are incompatible with the existence of any law, usage, or custom in confomity with which the said concession might have been
confirmed, had no change of sovereignty taken place. The court
doth, therefore, find the alleged concession and claim of the petitioners to be illegal in its origin, and invalid ; and doth, therefore, decide, adjudge, and decree against the yalidity of the
same ; and doth further order, adjudge, and decree, that the said
petitioners pay all costs and charges occasioned in and about the
'prosecution and defence of this suit.
The petitioners entered an appeal to this court.
At January terni, 1830, the cadse was argued by Mr. Benton,
for the appellants, and by Mr. Wi -t, attorney-general, for the
United States. rhe court held the case under advisement, as
stated in the opinion reported in 4 Peters 511.
The appeal was again argued at 'January term, 1835, by Mr.
White, for the appellants, and by Mr. Butler, attorney-general,
for the United States ; and was held under advisement to this
term ; when
Mr. Justice BALIDWIVN delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is an appeal from the decree of the district court of Missouri, on the petition of the plaintiffs, praying for the confirmation of their claim to a tract of land, pursuant to the act of 1824,
for the settlement of claims to land in that state.
The petition was in due form, setting forth such a case as gave
jurisdiction to the court below, who decided the claim to be invalid ; the appeal. is regularly taken according to the terms of
the law. It is in full proof that, on the 20th April, 1796, the
iieutenant-governor of upper Louisiana, in consideration of the
services rendered to the Spanish government by Antoine Soulard,
the ancestor 'of the petitioners, made a concession or order of
survey to him and his heirs forever, of a tract of land of ten thou.
sand arpents, French measure, to be surveyed and located on any
vacant land in the royal domain. Pursuant to this order, a survey, was made in February 1804, and recorded in the office of
the surveyor-general of the district, in March following.

[Soulard v. The United States.]

To the confirmation of this title various objections were made,
on the ground that such concession was not authorized by the
laws of Spain; but as they have all been fully considered and
overruled in the numerous cases which have been decided by
this Court, in claims to land in Florida, under the treaty with
Spain, and in Missouri under the treaty with France, and the
various acts of Congress on the subject; it is deemed unnecessary to notice them. To the survey no objections have been made,
if the concession is valid ; of which we can haue no doubt, consistently with the principles heretofore established by this court.
We are therefore of opinion, that the claims of the petitioners
to the land described in their petition is a good and valid title
thereto by the law of nations, the laws, usages, and customs of
Spain, (under whose government the title originated,) the treaty
between France and the United States for the cession of Louisiana, and the stipulations thereof, as well as the acts of Congress
in relation thereto ;and that it ought to be confirmed to the petitioners agreeably to the prayer of their petition.
The Court doth therefore finally order, adjudge, and decrethat the decree of the district court of Missouri be, and the same
is hereby annulled and reversed, except as to such part or parts
of the land surveyed to the said Soulard, pursuant to the aforesaid concession, as had been sold by the United States before the
filing of the petitions in this case, as to which the decree of the
district court is hereby affirmed, and the land so sold confirmed
to the United States. And this Court, proceeding to render such
decree as the district court ought to have rendered, doth further
order, adjudge, and decree, that the title of the petitioners to all
of said land embraced in said concession and survey, which has
not been so sold by the United States, is valid by the laws and
treaty aforesaid, and is hereby confirmed to them, agreeably to
said concession and survey. And the Court doth further order,
adjudge, and decree, that the surveyor of the public lands in the
state of Missouri shall cause the land specified therein and in
this decree, to be surveyed at the expense of the petitioners, and
to do such other acts thereon as are enjoined by law on such
surveyor. Also, that such surveyor shall certify on the plots and
certificates of such survey to be so made, what pait or parts of

[Soulard v. The United States.]

the originail survey of such land has been sold as aforesaid by
the United States, together with the -quantity thereof. Which
being ascertained, the said petitioners, their heirs or legal representatives, shall have the right to enter the same quantity of land
as shall be so certified to have been so sold by the United States,
in any land office in the state of Missouri,' after the same shall
have been offered for sale, which entry shall be made, conformably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided.
