EXECUTOR OF ROBERT BRENT, USE
APPELLANT V.

THE

PRESIDENT

AND

DIRECTORS OF THE BANK Cf- WASHINGTON..

Robert Brent was the holder of six hundred and fifty-nine shares of stock in the Bank
of Washingtbn; and was indebted to the bank as indorser on certain promissory
notes, one of which became due after his death. He was also indebted to the
United States, as paymaster; and lie made an assignment-of his property to satisfy
the debt. The assignees did not accept the assignment. He died some time afterwards. The bank, under the provision of their charter, which gives a lien on the
stock held by a debtor for the payment of debts due to them before the transfer of
the stock held by a stockholder, insisted on the lien, against the claim of priority
by the United States; and their-claim was sustained by the court.
It has been the uniform construction of the fifth section of the act of 1797, 1 Story's
Laws 464; and of the similar provision in the sixty-fifth .section of the collection act
of 1799,1 Story's Laws 630, that whether in a case of insolvency, death or assignment, the property of the debtor passes to the assignee, executor or administrator ;
the priority of the United States operating, not to prevent the transmission of the
property, but giving them a preference in payment out of the proceeds
This preference is in the appropriation of the debtor's estate; so that if, before.it has
attached, the debtor has conveyed or mortgaged his property, or it has been transferred in the ordinary course of business, neither fre overreached by the statutes;
and it has never been decided that it affects any lien, general or specific, existing'
when the event took place, which gave the United States a claim of priority.
Another rule is settled by these cases ; that the priority does not attachto property
legally transferred to a ,creditor on Tespondentia; though he may hold it subject to
an account, equity or trust for the borrower. Such transfer will be protected
against the United States; though not an out and out sale in the course of business,
so as to divest the oquitable as well as the legal interest of the party.
Every stockholder of a bank who draws or indorses a note to procure a loan from the
bank, is bound to know the terms of the charter and by-laws; his signature to
the note is an inchoate pledge of his stock for security, if so provided in the charter; lfis
stock gives credit to his name, and the bank grant the loan on its faith.

APPEAL from the circ'uit court of the United States for the county
of Washington in the District of Columbia.
Robert Brent, a paymaster of the army of the United States, having
become indebted to the United States, and being in an infirm state
of health ; on the 17th of May 1819, executed an assignment, stating
the situation of his health, and his earnest desire to satisfy and adjust
the claim of the government against him as paymaster as aforesaid,
and to do justice. to others ; and, that the better to secure these ob-

jects and puvposes, the assignment proceeded in,
the following terms:
"I have conveyed and assigned, and do by these presents' convey
and assign, in consideration of the premises, and for the sum of one
dollar to me in hand paid, to George Graham, Joseph Pearson and
Robert Y. Brent, all my real and personal estate, and property, in
whatsoever consisting, and wheresoever situated, to them, the said
George Graham, Joseph Pearsonand Robert Y. Brent, their executors and administrators, and to the survivor of them, nevertheless,
for paying and satisfying all just claim or claims of the government
as aforesaid ; as well as for satisfying all just claim or claims of all
others, as far forth as the said estate and property above conveyed
will answer, with full power and authority to them, or the majority
of them, to sell and convey, and to make good and sufficient titles
to All or any part of the property referged to, in conformity with the
intention and pulpose of this writing : it being well understood that.
the said trustees, after satisfying the purposes of the said trust, shall
well and fully account with the said Robert Brent, his heirs, executors or administrators, for the execution of the trust aforesaid, and
fully restore to the said Robert Brent, his heirs, executors or administrators, any overplus or surplusage that may remain of the estate
aforesaid ; and, it being also understood, that the said Robert Brent
reserves to himself the possession and use of such part of the property
aforesaid as may be for his reasonable support and maintenance;
and, likewise, the privilege of disposing of any part of the trust
estate, with the consent of the trustees, for the objects designated
above."
It was agreed that the assignees refused to accept the assignment, or to act under it.
Robert Brent died on the 7th of Septembe. 1819, leaving real and
personal estate ; and the executors qualified, and took possession
of his estate in 1820. At the time of his death he held six hundred and fifty-nine slhar"s of stock in the Bank of Washington
and at 'that time he was indebted to the bank, as indorser, on
two promissory notes: one for 1000 dollars, drawn by Thomas
L. Washington, and'indorsed by Robert Brent, due and protested
on the 22d of May 1819 ; the other for 667 dollars, also drwin
by Mr Washington, and indorsed by Mr Brent, diue and protested
on the 29th of May 1819 : lie wvas also, at the time of hris death,

which became due and was protested on the 19th of November

1819:'making, together with the other notes, the sum of 2067
dollars ; of which 1667 dollars only were due at his decease.
Some years after the death of Robert Brent, the Bank of Washington instituted a suit against the executors on the iote of 400 dollars, and on the note of 667 dollars ; and on a plea of the statute of
limitations, a verdict and judgment. were rendered for the defendants.
The ele'vcnth sec'tion of the charrer of the Bank of Washington
provides, that "alf'debts actually due and payable to the bank, (days
of grace for payment being passed) by a stockholder requesting a
transfer, must b.e &atisfied befbre such transfer shall be made, unless
.the president and directors slial direct to the contrary."
' The same scction of the charter also declares : " that the shares
of capital stock at any time owned by any individual stockholder,
shall- be transferable only on the books of the bank, according to
such rules as may, conformably to law, be established in that behalf
by the pqesident and directors."
The certificates of stock issued by the bank declare, that " the
shares are to be tLnsferred at the bank by the stockholder, or his
attorney, on surrendering the certificateof the same." There is also
-a provision :in the section, which authorizes the directors to make
regulations for the..governtent and t-aitciioiis of the bank, "conformable to law."
The executors of Robert Brent, in the Year 1820, called upon the
Ba k of Iashington, anc requested to be allowed to transfer the,
stock held by their testator.'. This was refused, without the payment
of the notes Ate bank claiming the ,same under the provision of the
charter : which, it was insisted, gives the bank a right to be so paid.
In 1835 the bank had retained dividends on the stock, and had sold
a part of it, amounting to 289 dollars and 80 cents.
Bills were'filed in tle circuit court, by the surviving executor of
Robert Brent, for the use of the United States, against the Bank of
Washington, c(aiming right to transfe the stock for the payment
of the debt due to the United States ; on the allegation of the right
of priority given to tle United States by the acts of congress. The
Bank of Washington, at the sane, tinie, filed a bill claiiningdto appro

them ; and asserting tlwir right to a lien and to payment under the
provisions of the charter.

the parties to these suits.

"It is agreed by and between the said parties, that if the court-sbll

SUPREME COURT.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

The circuit court, on the 261h of January 1826, made the following decree in the two cases.
",These causes coming on to be heard upon the bill, answers and
exhlbits,'and the facts stated in the agreement entered into between
the complainants and defendants, it is this 22d day of January, in
the year 1836, ordered, and decreed by the court, that the stock of
Robert Brent deceased, standing in his name, in the Bank of Washington, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the several
notes in the said agreement specified, be. sold at public vendue, on
the credit of sixty or ninety days, the purchasers to give notes with
good indorsers, as the trustee may approve ; notice being first given
of the day.of sale in one of the city newspapers, and that J. Hellen
be, and he is hereby appointed a trustee to make said sale, aid after
paying the expenses of sale and costs of suit to defendants, he shall
apply the proceeds of the sale to the payment of all the notes of said
Brent, enumerated in the above statement as due to said defendants ;
and it is further decreed, that the balance of said stock shall be transferred to the United States by said, defendants, on the books of said
bank.",
The United States prosecuted this appeal
The case was argued by Mr Butler, attorney-general, for the United
States; and by Mr Key, for the appellants; and by Mr Hellen, for
the appellee.
For the United jStates it was contended, that at the time of the
execution of' the assigilment nothing was due by Robert Brent to
the.Bank Pf W hiugt6n. His liabilities were as indorser on certain pronlis.iry notes, which, to the amount of 1667 dollars, became
due after, theassignment was made ;' and the residue of the debt
claimed-by the bank, 400 dollars,, became due after Mr Brent's detease.
The provision of the charter is in favour of debts actually due,
and the'days of grace on a note must have expired before the debt
can be claimed. Thus, then, the United States, by the terms of the
assignment, as well as by the operation of the statutes giving them
a right of priority, became entitled to payment of the debt due to
them, to the exclusion of the claims of the bank. The deed was an
act of insolvency. In addition to the general principles which give
the United States the prior right to the property of their insolvent

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.)

debtor, so as to exclude all other creditors: the decree bf the circuit
court is erroneous, even if these principles do not apply; as the Bank
of Washington is-allowed to claim payment of the two notes on
which suits were instituted, and judgfients obtained in favour of the
executors, on the plea. of the statute of imitations.
. The priority claimed by the United States rests
in this case on the
fifth section of the act of congress of 1797; 2 Laws U. S. 595; which
extends the right of priority to all cases of insolvency. The United
States v.-Fisher, 2 Cranch 358. The act of 1799 relates to duty
bonds only.
It is said that there is no proof that Robert Brent was indebted to
the United States. The precise amount of the debt is not stated;
but the-whole proceedings in the case go upon the ground that he
was so indebted. , The assignment of 17th May.1819, contains an
acknowledgement that he was indebted; and the agreed facts authorize the court to assume that he was a public debtor.
The next question is, whether Robert Brent became insolvent.
It is objected that the assignment is not of all the property of the
assignor ; but an inspection of the instrument will satisfy the court
that it is full and sufficient for the purpose of enabling the trustees
to carry its purposes into effect, by selling the whole estate of the
assignor.
If the trustees did not accept of the assignment, and no action took
place under it, th6'objection to the claims of the United States under
it may not be valid : but still the assignment is evidence of the insolvency of Mr Brent; and, the fact of his insolvency being thus
established, to.give, from the period of its execution, a-right of the
United States to be paid the debt due to them; that right could not
afterwards be disturbed or affected.
The right of the United States to be paid by the executors in opposition to the claims of the bank, if not under the assignment made
•by their testator, exists under the provision which gives the priority
in cases of the decease of persons indebted to the United States:
One of the notes was not due until after the decease of Mr Brent;
and there was, therefore, at the time of his death, no more thin a
contingent liability for that note. He was indorser on the note of
John Cook for 400 dollars; which became due and was protested on
the 19th November 1819. The rights of the United Stales were.
absolute, and were fixed before the claim by the bank existed. As
indorser, up to the failure of the drawer to pay, and until after demand

[Brent v. The Bank of Washington. ]

and protest,'no debt was due by him. The drawer of a note is said
to be a debtor. from the date of the note : his debt is debitum in presenti, solvendurn in futuro; but not so an indorser.
The bank has no claim "on the.notes sued for, and in which suit
a judgment, on the statute of limitations, vas rendered against the
bank. The obligation to pay the debt was at an end, when the
judgment was given. Thus, if the bank had a lien on the stock, as
they elected to sue out the notes, the lien was abandoned. While
in England it may be different; in the United States, after the statute
of limitations has attached, the debt is gone, and a new promise is
absolutely necessary to re-create the debt.
It is not admitted that a construction can be given to the charter
of the bank which will interfere with the priority of the "government.
Whatever effect the provisions of the charter, giving the bank a lien
on the stock of their debtors, may have in the case of Individuals;
no such effect can exist as will interfere with'the right of the United
States to their priority.. The object of the charterwas not to repeal
laws already established'and in full force; and least of all, laws
which are deemed essential to the fiscal operations of the government, such as those which give the government priority of claim in
cases of the insolvency or decease of their debtors. The whole of
the eleventh section of the charter must be taken into consideration.
It empowers the directors to make regulations conformable to. law.
From these words it may be inferred, that congress did not intend
by the charter to alter any existing laws. They-recognised in this
provision the laws as established and in force; and' the rules'and
regulations of the bank were to be in ,harmony with them.
Mr Hellen, for the appellees, observed,, that before he proceeded to
discuss the several propositions arising in the cause, it would be necessary to state, that the record provided the proof of every fact that
could, on the part of the bank, be 'required, to charge the-stock of
the deceased, by virtue of the, eleventh. clause of the act of congress,
entitled an act to incorporate the Bank of Washington, passed the
15th February 1811.
It is admitted by the appellants, that their.testator died indebted
to the bank, on the respective notes described in the statement of
facts agreed upon by all the parties to both the suits set for hearing
in the court below. It is admitted, that at the time of his death,
Robert Brent held six hu'ndred and fifty-nine shares of stock in the

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

bank. That the notes were severallyprQtesled, andcthat due notice
of their non paytment was regularly given to him in his lifetime, or,
to his executors since his decease., That the notes were yet due and
unpaid.
The record thus substantiating the debts due to the bank, he should
respectfully submit to the consideration of the court, in support of
the decree rendered in favour of the bank by the circuit court, the
following propositions- 1st. That the eleventh clause of the charter
of the bank, which required "that all debts actually due and payable to the bank, (days of grace for payment being passed) by a
stockholder requesting a transfer, must be satisfied before such transfer shall be made, unless the president and directors shall direct to
the contrary ;" gives the bank a lien on the stock held by Robert
Brent at the.time of his death.
2. That the act of 1799, which directs "that in all cases of insolvency, or where an estate in the hands of executors, administrators, or
assignees, shall be insufficient.to pay -all the debts due from the deceased, the debt.or debts due to the U.nited States shall be first
satisfied ;" gives to the United States a simple priortty of payment,
and no lien ; and that it cannot divest the bank's lien.
3. That even if the United States have a priority of payment, by
the act of 1799, the charter of the -bank affects it; there being in the
charter no exception in favour of the United States.
4. That this- stock never has been an estate in the hands of the
executors, but as incumbered with the lien.
5. That the deed of Robert Brent,jn favour of the assignees,
never was accepted by them; and it is therefore void.
-6. That the stock can only be transferred as the charter directs.
7. That the statute of limitations cannot discharge the lien.
Mr Hellen remarked, that the first proposition was so obvious, that
he would even pass it by without comment, were it not necessary
to fix a precise idea of the extent of the rights of the bank, as provided, by the clause of the charter.
The clause is itself imperative. The words " all debts actually
due and payable to the bank, must be satisfied, before such transfer
shall be made, (days of grace being passed)" are "absolute, explicit,
and peremptory ;" and show that no discretion is given : and when
that is the case, even affirmative words make a statute imperative.
The fundamental rule for expounding statutes is, "that if it can
be prevented, no clause, sentence or word should be deemed su-

SUPREME COURT.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

perfluous, void, or insignificant.". To say, then, that the stock
can be trarisferred, before the debts of the stockholder .are satisfied, is to rerider every word inoperative, insignificant and entirely
nugatory. The right, of the bank to be first paid, before the
stqck -can, be transferred, must be wholly annihilated, before the
United States can, by the legal fiction, have it vested in the executors at the death of their testator, so as to make it an estate in
their hands, to authorize a-priority of payment to the government.
This makes it a conflict between a right secured by the charter and
a legal fiction. The doctrine of relation cannot, however,,divest any
right legally Vested in another ; as where rent was-due to laxidlord
'who died, and execution was levied on.the tenant's goods before letters granted,.on a notice by administrator to the sheriff, to pay him a
year's rent, agreeably to the statute of 8 Anne, ch. 17; the court
held that relations, which are but legal fictions of law, should never
divest any right legally vested in another. I Williams on Executors 398. He should show hereafter, when he -undertook to discuss
the fourth proposition, that the Maryland statute placed an executor
on the same footing as an administrator by the common, law ; and
at this time, merely asked the court to apply this doctrine of relation
to the note of 400 dollars, which'fell due after the death of Robert
Brent. That note fell due on the 19th of November 1819; Robert
Brent died on the 7th September 119, and letters testamentary were
not granted until 1820. So that the note having fallen due before
.the executors had a right to demand of. the bank a transfer of the
stock, which right only accrued to them by virtue of the letters testamentary, this legal fiction cannot divest the right of the bank
(which was perfected when the note fell due) to be satisfied,
before they could enforce a transfer of the stock. He also stated,that all the shares were bound for the payment of the note due
on the 22d May 1819; and that alone operated to destroy the
common law right, by which an estate vests in the executor at the
death of the testator. Suppose, instead of stock, it was a movable
chattel of the testator's in the bank, which the charter providedshould- not be assigned, or delivered up, before the notes were "satisfied." How could an executor, by virtue of this constructive right
to the property, proceed to enforce that right? Tlhus test the extent
of his.powers. He could not maintain an action of trover, because
there would be no illegal conversion. Replevin would not lie, because there would be no tortious taking of the property. Detinue

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

would*not aid him, because he has:no right to.the immediat* possession ; for,. in the language of the.charter, the debt must be satisfied before a transfer shall be made. It cannot be contended, that
the death of a stockholder changes the rights of his representatives.
Executors stand in the place of their deceased, and are bound by his
covenants, although not named in the deed. His act has the same
effect. - They'take subject to the rights of the bank, as secured by
the charter. In Wilkinson v. Leland and others, 2 Peters 658, it is
expressly ruled, "that where an heir takes real estate, his title is
incumbered with all the liens, created by the party or the law; at
his decease." This court, in the case of the Union Batik of Georgetown v. Laird, 2 Wheaton 390, decided that the charter of the bank
conferred a lien on the stock.
Having thus by authorities of the most commanding character,
clearly established the lien ; he should proceed, with a full conviction of the magnitude of the subject, to invite the attention of the
court to the important principle involved in the examination of his
second proposition. Can the priority of the United States, by the
act of 1799, divest a lien ? In stating the question in this form, lie
suggested that it permitted the United States, very improperly, to
advance a move in the game. The true question is not whether
the acts of congress aul divest alien, by virtue of the priority; as
whether a debtor on whose property a lien has attached, can by his
conveyance, assignment, or death, divest that lien?
By. the acts of congress, an estate is to be "in the hands of executors or assignees," before the priority of the government accrues.
This arises in the one case by the act of God, which, when it happens, never defeats vested rights. The other depends on the act
and deed of the debtor. He must convey, and the priority of the
United States is dependent on that conveyance. If a debtor can by
his own deed or grant to assignees, defeat a prior lien, this he can
effect by any bona fide alienation. A marriage settlement or contract will accomplish it. If it can be done by an insolvent debtor,
the solvent debtor, by a conveyance, can also discharge pre-existingliens.
If adebtor by his conveyance can discharge a lien, he can discharge any and every lien, such as the parties create by contract;
such as arise by operation of law; such as are created by statutes.
Suppose then, that these statutes gave to the United States, not a
simple privilege, but a lien on the property of their debtors. Could

SUPREME COURT.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

it be contended, that the c6nveyance of the debtor in the one case,
would defeat the lien, or that his death in the other, where there
were judgment creditors, would entitle them toa preference in payment out of the very property which was incumbered Withftlie lien?
If this be the law, it demonstrates that what you call a lien "is an
unreal mockery," a non-descript, uninbstantial, and over which the
creditor has no controlling interest. This, however, is not so. Such
a position is exploded by the argumentum ad absurdum. If it could
be sustained, it would expose all legislative or statutory liens to the
charge of the most inefficient and fatuitous folly.
But suppose a contract provides in its very terms, that the creditor
shall have a lien on a chattel, and congress should pass an act displacing the lien of the creditor. This would be a law impairing the
obligation of a contract, and consequently void. Now, if it cannot be
impaired by direct legislation, it cannot be done indirectly. The tenth
section of the first article of the cohstitution of the United States, prevents the states 4rorn passing a law impairing the obligation of a
contract. , Congress has no power to pass such a law. No such
power is delegated to congress ; and the tenth amendment to the constitution, reserves to the people the powers not delegated to congress.
He should now refer to adjudicated principles; and inasmuch
as he should refer to English cases, he would first advert to the
laws of the crown, as this regarded the debts of the subject. In
Ram on Assets 19, we find, that by the statutes of 33 Hen. 8, ch.
39, and 13 Eliz. ch. 4, the crown has a lien on personal property,
from the date of the writ or bond ; on real estate, the moment the
subject takes office. The laws of this country are different ; bit the
fallacy of the notion that a priority of payment, which is not a'!ien,
can divest a lien, flows immediately by taking the converse princi.
pie. In Fisher v. Blight, 2 Cranch 358, this court decided that
these laws did not confer a lien on the debtor's goods; and the reason apparently assigned for it is, "that no transfer of property in the
ordinary course of business was overreached." Suppose then that
these laws of congress, as the English statutes do, declared it to be
a lien ; would it not "overreach a bona fide transfer of property, in
the ordinary ,way of business." If it could, not, the consequence is
that it confers no security at all, if the goods be not thereby bound.
The same reasoning will apply to the case of the United States v.
Hoe, 3 Cranch 73. The next case to which he would invoke the
consideration of the court, was that of Conard v. The Atlantic

JANUARY TERM 1836.

607

[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

Insurance Company, 1 Peters 441, 444. What is there asserted
as to -this priority of the United States I - "Why 4hat it is obvious,
that the priority of the United States cannot divest a lien, because it
is not equivalent to a lien." In that case, it is also remarked, that
the authority of Nathan v. Giles, 5 Taunton 578, would require very
grave consideration, before any such principle should be sanctioned,
as that this priority of the United States can divest a lien. This is it.'
"When a factor had a lien on acargo, which was attached by a creditor, the court directed theproceeds of sale to be paid to the factor."
-But in England the king's prerogative. has never been sufficiently
strong to divest a lien, greatly as it exceeds this comparatively
feeble power of priority given by these acts to the YUnited States.
In Rex v. Lee and others, 6 Price 369, wher'e a factor had a lien on
goods, and -they were seized by an extent, in .favour of the crown,
against the principal, the court ordered the proceeds of the sale to
be applied in discharge of the lien.- Suppose that the principal
had died, could it be pretended, that this thereby defeated the lien,
so as to give the crown a right to the proceeds, when'i the lien or
right to it still existed ? . Rorke v. Dayrell, 4 Term Reports 402, also
decides "that where goods are seized on a. fieri facias, as the
king's debtor's, and before they are sold, an extent *comes, at the
king's suit, grounded on a bond debt, tested'after delivery of the fieri
facias; the extent cannot affect those goods." The case of Thelluson v. Smith presents a very simple question. A junior judgment
creditor seizes land which was bound by a prior judgment; and the.
senior creditor, instead of enforcing payment, by levying on the land
in the possession of the purchaser, trys to have the proceeds of the
sale applied to the payment of his senior judgment. This he had
no right to do, but instead of the sale of the land divesting his lien,
it was still liable; and by issuing a scire facias, against the purchaser,
so as to put his judgment in a condition for execution, that lien could
be enforced.
In order to show that the death of the party could not defeat
the lien creditor's rights, so as to vest the estate in the hands
of executors discharged of the lien ; he cited, Bolton v. Tate,
1 Swanston 84: also, Montague on Lien 61; who states, "that
solicitor of plaintiff, who dies, has a lien upon the sum decreed in
preference to bond creditors." In Hammond v. Barclay, 2 East
227, it.was argued, that the death of a debtor annulled the lien by
revoking the authority. The court said, "such a position was inconsistent with the justice of the case."

SUPREME COURT;
(Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

If this argument should be sanctioned as the law of the land, he beseeched the court to consider the dreadful consequences which would
ensue from such a principle. A ship owner has a lien on the cargo for
freight. He makes his voyage, that is to say,'he is in sight of land;
and before his arrival in port, the owner of the cargo dies. His estate
is insolvent, and the consequence is, that his lien is utterly defeated.
So also, the hardy tar, who perils the dangerof the sea, is to go unpaid,
after making, probably, a voyage to the distant Indies. But specification is useless. This deleterious and shameful perversion of justice
can be confined to no order. It will inflict ruin upon th6 adventurous
mariner, the enterprising merchant, the careful and- industrious
mechanic;'and before the jurisprudence of the country should be
stained with so odious a principle, it was right that it should receive
te grave consideration of this court.
Should the court be even disposed to sanction the principles contended for by the appellant; yet the record in this case furnished no
evidence of any one fact which could Fustain the claim of the government..
It has been already settled by this court, that "on an appeal, the
court can only take notice of matters of fact appearing upon the record." Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 9 Peters 110 ; 5 Peters
248. There is no proof on the record that Robert Brent died indebted to the United States. No bond or transcript of his account is
certified in due form by the proper officers of the government. There
is no proof of his having committed a legal insolvency. There is no
proof on the record, that his estate in the hands of his executors is
insufficient to pay his debts. The answer does not admit it. No
account of assets; no schedule of his debts establishes the fact.
There is no proof, that he held the stock when he made the deed.
The appellants admit that the trustees did not accept the deed ; and
that at the time of its execution Robert Brent owned a large estate
in fee simple. This admits the deed to be void; and if it were not,
by the decision in United States v. Hoe, p. 73, it must convey all
his property to give z. priority. In this deed there are no words of
inheritance ; and, of course, it cannot vest an estate in fee simple.
Robert Brent made a will; and that is sufficient to show that the
deed did not include all his estate : so that the appellant has no
proof to authorize a reversal of the decree. The priority cannot
affect the lien of the appellees ; because the charter contains no exception in favour of the United States. It is also matter of subsequent creation to the act of 1799.

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Brent v. -Te rBank of Washington,]

It is admitted, that th king of Great Brittm, by virtue .of his prerogative, is not affected by either of these objections. He is not
bound by any act unless named. He should, however, insist, that
before the United States can claim the benefit of this prerogative,
they must introduce it into the system of the body politic by a legislative act. Until the legislative power bf the government, in a lawful way, by a positive statute, asserts a claim to this prerogative, it
continued a dormant, inoperative and powerless right, inherent in
the constitution, but to be born of congress before it can be nursed
by the judiciary, or even be considered as a vigorous, practical and
active principle. The judiciary is constituted for the express object
of expounding the laws of the country. A law there must be emnanating with the legislature, before the functions of the judiciary can
commence.
Should this distinction be not carefully observed by each coordinate branch of the government; which it was the great object
of the framers of the constitution to provide, in separating their
poNers, and allotting to each its distinct duties: then the rights
of the legislative department are disregarded.
Blackstone on
the King's Prerogative, vol. 1, p. 240, observes, that "it was customary, in the early history of England, for the king to sit as a judge
to expound the laws in his own courts." This alone accounts for
the manner in which the prerogative of the king has been cherished
by judicial authority. To illustrate, however, the precise import of
this principle, he would take the prerogative, which gave priority in
payment to the king. Suppose that congress had never legislated
on this subject. It is admitted that the power to make the law exists in congress. Without a law, could the attorney-general, on the
death of a citizen indebted to the United States, by virtue of this
prerogative, compel an executor to prefer the debt of the government?
Suppose he should sue him, and allege a devastavit, because he paid
judgment creditors in preference to the debts due to the United
States: would the court allow this prerogative to operate against
the executor? Tho king has also the right to erect beacons, light
houses, &c. He. can take the money from the public treasury to
make the erection., In this country congress possesses such power.
They can, by statutory Vnactments, authorize their erection. But
neither the'executive nor the judiciary can claim the prerogative.
If thisbe not so, then the social fabric, the constitution of the country, is placed upon no solid bttsis of delegated powers. He admitted
VOL. x.-4 B

1,

SUPREME COURT.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

that the common law had been received in civil cases as a part of
the jurisprudence of the United States; where it did not conflict
with the fundamental principles of its republican form of government.
.This prerogative of the king is an exception to the general principle
of the common law. "By the word prerogative, we usually understand, that special pre-eminence which the king hath over and
above all other persons, out of the ordinary course of the common
-law,. in right of his regal dignity." 1 Black. 240.
But this charter is a contract, a grant, a franchise. All its rights
are beyond the reach of the government. He would not stop to apply this principle; but would refer to the case of the Dartmouth
College, 4 Wheat. 518. He would say, however, that congress gave
the bank a right to hold the stock until the debt was paid; and this
right was valuable to the institution. This stock is not assets in the
hands of execuiors: "where a testator pledges goods, they are not
assets until redeemed." 2 Williams on Executors 1015. By the
act of Maryland of 1798, c. 101, sub. c. 3, "an executor or executrix named in a will cannot dispose of the chattels oi interfere therewith until letters issue: he must give bond within twenty days.
The court must direct a sale. By this modification he stands as an
administrator at common law, and' had nio right to ask a transfer
before letters issued.
As to the fifth and sixth points, the attorney-general admitted the
deed to be inoperative, the trustees not having accepted it. As to
limitations, it goes to the remedy, and does not affect the debt. He
cited Montague on Lien, app. 38, to show that the lien was not discharged by the statute. Indeed, the very essence of a Jien was a
right to retain the chattel until he debt was satisfied,
Mr Justice BALDWIN delivered the opinion of the Court.
Robert Brent, the testator, owned six hundred and fifty-nine shares
of the capital stock of the Bank of Washington in this District, which
stood in his name on their books at the time of his death in September 1819: when he was indebted to the bank 1667 dollars as indorser
of two notes drawn by J. L. Washington;. one of which was protested on the 19th, the other on the 22d of May preceding, and due
notce thereof given. He was also indorser of a note of John Cooke
due said bank, payable on the 19th of November 1819, which was
also duly protested, and notice thereof given. On the 17th of May
1819, he made an assignment of all his estate, real and personal, 1,'

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

secure the United States, to whom he was indebted, and all other
creditors; which was recorded the same day, but never was accepted
by the trustees, and became inoperative.
In 1820 the complainants, as executors, administered on the estate,
when they called on the bank to allow them to transfer the stock
belonging to the estate; which was refused by the bank on the claim
of a lien for the amount of the above notes, of which they demanded
payment before they would permit a transfer thereof on their books.
Suits were afterwards brought by the bank against the executors, to
recover the amount of the three notes; in one of which they obtained
a verdict: on the two others, verdicts were obtained in favour of the
executors, on the plea of the act of limitations.
In 1827 the executors filed their bill on the equity side of the circuit court, praying for a decree to transfer the stock discharged from
any alleged lien of the bank for the debt due by the testator; on the
ground, that being a debtor -to the United States. to a large amount,
and his estate insafficient to pay his debis, the debt due to them
ought to be first paid, pursuant to Lhe provisions of the fifth section
of the act of 1.797, 1 Story 464, 465 ; and that the debts claimed by
the bank were barred by the act of limitations, 'and the verdict rendered for the defendants. These are the only-questions in the case.
The act of congress referred to is in these words: "that where any
revenue !'fficer or other person hereafter becoming indebted to the
United States by bond or otherwise, shall become insolvent; or where
the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of executors or administrators, shall be insufficient to pay all debts due from the deceased,
the debt due to the United -States shall be first satisfied."
It has been the uniform construction of this act, and the similar
provsion in the sixty-fifth section of the collection act of 1799, 1 Story
630, that whether in a case of insolvency, death or assignment, the
property of the debtor passes to the assignee, executor or administrator; the priority of the United States operating, not to prevent the
transmission of-the property, but giving them a preference in payment out of the proceeds. Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Company,
I Pters 439.
This preference is in the appropriation of the debtor's estate; so
that if, before it has attached, the debtor has conveyed-or mortgaged
his property, or it has been transferred in the ordinary course of'business, neither are overreached by the statutes, I Peters 440: and it
has never been decided that it affects any lien, general or specifio

SUPREME COURT.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

existing when the event took place which gaVe. the United States a
claim of priority. In the case of Conard v- The Atlantic Insurance
Company, above quoted, in Con,-rd v. Nicholl, 4 Peters 291, and
Conard v. The Pacific Insurance Company, 6 Peters 262, 279, this
court considered the effect of the priority of the United States, in
cases where their debtor had taken up money on respondentia bonds,
on an agreement- that the bill of lading of the goods therein mentioned, should be indorsed to the lenders as a collateral security for
the loan; that the return cargo should be consigned to them- on their
account and risk, the bills of lading to be so expressed, indorsed in
blank and delivered to them,. and the property be delivered to the
order of the shippers, as a continuation of the collateral security.
This was held, in all these cases, to amount to a transfer of the absolute legal right to the property composing the return cargo, to the
holders of the bonds; so as to enable them to recover their value from
the marshal, who had levied on them by virtue of an execution at
the suit of the United States, and detained them after a demand of
delivery. They recovered damages commensurate with their legal
right of property; and the court would not inquire whetlier, in any
event, the lenders on respondentia could be considered as trustees for
the borrower, his creditors or assigns; deeming it immaterial. 6 Peters 272.
Another rule is settled by these cases: that the. priority does not
attach to property legally transferred to a creditor on respondentia,
though he may hold it subject to an account, equity or trust for the
borrower. Such transfer will be protected against the United States;
though not an out and out sale in the course of business, so as to
divest the equitable as well as the legal interest of the party. Such
a transaction approximates to one which merely gives a lien; its
object is security, not a sale : it is in law a sale by the shape of the
contract and securities, but if the goods were of greater value than
the debt due, equity would compel an account. for the surplus, considering the Whole transaction to have been one of loan and priority
merely. On the other hand, if the borrower, his creditor or assignee
should come into equity to ask such -account, it would be decreed to
him only after the payment of the debt due ;.the holder of the security would be aUowed to retain it for such purpose, however defective it might be at law. Nor'would a court of equity take from the
lender any legal right, which he might have to the possession of the

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

property, or to prevent its transfer to another, whereby such right
would be impaired; if his conduct had been bona fide.
Whatever may be the defects in the rights of a bona fide creditor
at law, equity will protect him in their enjoyment, till they are lost
at law; if his conscience is not so affected as to bring him within the
jurisdiction of a court of conscience, which does not administer legal
remedies for legal rights. Its action is on equitable rights, by equitable
.remedies; or legal rights for which the law provides no remedy,
(3 Peters 447) or none so adequate as equity, so beneficial or complete. 9 Wheat. 845. This is a case of that description, or the plaintiffs have no standing in equity; for if they have a complete legal right
to priority of payment out of the stock of ME Brent, -ad a remedy to
enforce it, plain, adequate and complete at law, the sixteenth section
of the judiciary act, 1 Story 59, is a proviso on the jurisdiction of a
court of equity ; and it is not a case in equity, under the third article
of the constitution.
In the bill of the complainants, they do not contest the lien of the.
bank by any paramount' right in themselves as executors; they are
the mere conduits through whom the United States claim the benefit
of the legal priority given them by law; which the executors are compelled to assert, in order to save themselves from the consequences'of
their. paying any other debt than that due to the United States before it is satisfied, as prescribed by the sixty-fifth section of the collection act.
If Mr Brent was such a debtor as is contemplated by the law, and
died without property sufficient to pay his debts; the right to satisfaction out of his estate, in preference to any other creditors, is un-.
doubtedly in the United.States. The record does not. contain any
evidence of insolvency : but as the case has been argued on the assumption that it existed, and that Mr Brent was a debtor within the
purview of the law ; the court will so consider him and his estate.
Assuming then the right of the United States as respects the executors, and all his creditors, except the bank, to priority of payment, to
be complete ; we find them, through the executors, plaintiffs in
equity, claiming a decree for the transfer of the stock of the teotator
standing on the books of the bank, in order to have it sold for the
exclusive payment of their, debt. A court of law cannot do this, for
by the eleventh section of the bank charter, the stock is transferable
only on the books of the bank, according to such rules as may, conr
formably to law, be established in that behalf by the president and

SUPREME COURT.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

directors. Davis's Laws Dist. of Col. 224. On a similar provision
in the charter of the Union Bank of Georgetown, this court, in the
Union Bank v. Laird, declared, that "no person could acquire a legal title to any shares, except under a regular transfer, according to
the rules of the bank." 2 Peters 393. The executors cannot sustain a suit at law in their own right, for refusing to permit such
transfer; inasmuch as, by another clause of the same article in the
charter, it is provided : "but all debts actually due and payable to
the bank, (days of grace for payment being past) by a stockholderrequesting a transfer, must be satisfied, before such transfer shall be
made, unless the president and directors shall direct to the contrary."
As Mr Brent owed the debts now claimed by the bank, on the
notes due and protested before his death, this would be a complete
answer to a suit at law by his executors, for not permitting a transfer; and the same objection would he fatal to a suit in their name for
the use of the United States. The defence is a legal one : the case
provided for by the charter and by law had happened; the bank had
a perfect right to hold on to the stock; and this court has decided in
the case of Laird, that a rule of the bank imposing such. a restriction
on the transfer of stock, is conformable to law. 2 Wheat. 392, 393.
The United States have no pretence of a legal right to a transfer
of the stock to themselves, or to recover damages for refusing it: the
right to hold the stock devolves on the executors, to whose. hands it
must come for sale and distribution : the proceeds, not the stock, go
to the United States in virtue of their priority : such are the words
of the law-" the estate of any deceased debtor in the hands of executors or admtinistrators.". Thus compelled.to come into equity for
a remedy to enforce a legal right, the United States must come as
other suitors, seeking.in the administration of the law of equity, relief; togive which, courts of law are wholly incompetent, on account
of the legal bar interposed by the bank. This court, in the United
States v. Mitchell, 9 Peters 743, have recognized the principle in the
common'law, that though the law gives the king a better or more
convenient remedy, he has no better right in court, than the subject
through whom the property claimed comes to hi hands. 2 Co. Ins[.
573; 2 Ves. Sen. 296,297; Hard. 60,460.. This principle is also carried
into all the statutes, by which the appropriate courts are authorized
to decide, and 'under which they do decide on the rights of a subject
in a controversy with the king, according to equity and good conscience between subject anti subject. 7 Co. .19; 6 Hard. 27, 170,
230,-502; 4 Co. Inst. 190.

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

It is not difficult, in this case, to decide what the rules of equity
and good conscience require. The bank have lent their money on the
name, credit and stock of Mr Brent, before the United States could.
have any claim of preference. Two notes were due, protested, and
the legal lien of the bank for their payment complete: as to the
third, the time for repayment had not arrived before such right attached on the property of Mr Brent in the hands of his executors ;
but it was confined to what belonged to, and was part- of the assets of the estate. The right was a legal one ; the claim of the
United States was a statutory one; but its existence was not founded
on any bad faith of the bank, its conscience was unaffected, and by
law they held the legal control of the transfer of their stock: their
consent was necessary to the transmission of the legal title to the
executors; and the only ground on which the aid of a court of equity
is asked to compel them to give their consent, is a legal claim to the
proceeds, by a right which will deprive the bank.of all security for
their debt. In good conscience there can be no claim more equitable
thin that of the bank for money lent; and if the law has placed
them on the tabula in naufragio, it little comports with the principles
of equity.to take it from them, merely because, by the death of Mr
Brent before the protest of the third note, the legal lien, secured by
their charter, had not become consummated, before the legal right of
the United States had attached to priority of payment out of his
estate. An individual asserting such a claim in equity against the
bank, in virtue of an act of bankruptcy, an execution or assignment,
between the date and the prote~t of the note, would be compelled to
do equity before he could enforce his legal right: and we can perceive
no reason why the United States should be exempted from this fundamental rule of equity, subject to which, its courts administer their
remedy.
Every stockholder who draws or indorses a note to procure a loan
from the bank, is bound to know the terms of the charter and bylaws; his signature to the note is an inohoate pledge of his stock for
security ; his stock gives credit to his name, and the bank grants the
loan on its faith.
Though the charter has not made the note a lien on the stock till
the note is protested; so as to give the bank both a legal and equitable right to refuse the transfer till it is paid; yet it has given them
the power to prevent a transfer unless on their books, by such rules
as they may prescribe ; which gives them: power to prevent the legal

SUPREME COURT.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.] ,

title'from. passing to a purchaser. .Connecting this with the power
to make by-laws for the government of the bank and the managemert of their, concerns, the bank would have a strong case in equity,
had the later clause in the eleventh section of their charter been
omitted.
Under the usual clause in the charter to the Hudson Bay Company to make by-laws, &c., they had made one respecting the trans
fer of their stock, so that it should be first liable for debts due to the
company by.their own members, or to answer the calls o( the company on their stock. One of the stockholders, indebted to the company for money received for their use, became bankrupt; his as-.
signees brought a bill to compel a transfer of his stock, which was
opposed by the company in virtue of their by-laws. The chancellor
declared "the by-law a good one; for the legal interest of all the
stock is in the company, who are trustees for the severai members,
and nay order that the dividends to be mrale, shall be under particular restrictions or terms; and by the same reason that this by-.
law is objected to, the common by-laws of companies, to deduct. the
calls out of the stocks of the members :efusing to pay their calls,
may be said to be void." Child v. Hudson Bay Co., 2 P. W. 207,
2O ; S. P. 1 Str. 645 ;'1 Eq. Cas. Ab. 9, pl. 8; 13 Ves. 428, 429.
In Waln's Assignees v. The Bank of North America, it was l1d
by the supreme court of Pennsylvania, that when, by the -known
usage of a bank, the stock of a debtor was not transferable till the
debt was paid, such usage was binding on his assignees ; the bank
having, by their charter, power to make by-laws, and having made
one requiring all transfers to be made on their books, in the presence
of its officers. 8 S. &R. 73, 86. In giving such power by charter, and
executing it by such a by-law, the intention'of the law of incorporation is, most evidenly, to give a security to the bank: by pertrmitting
a transfer and giving a certificate to the .holder, the bank give up all
claims on the stock; the legal right . to supervise tht transfer was
intended for their benefit. On this principle, this court say, "no
person, therefore, can acquire a legal title to any shares, except under a regular transfer, according to the rules of the bank; and if
any person takes an equitable assignment, it must be subject to the
rights of the bank under the act of incorporation, of which he is
bound to take notice." 2 Wheat. 393.
The principle of these cases covers the present in all its bearings.
It, is admitted that the bank have a legal right to withhold the

JANUkRY TERM 1836.
[Brent v. The Bank of Washington.]

transfer till payment of the notes protested in the lifetime of Mr Brent;
the case is equally clear in equity as to the note indorsed by him
and discounted by the bank, though not protested till after his death.
A commission of bankruptcy relates to the act of bankruptcy, having the effect of an execution; it prevents the transmission of the
bankrupt's property from that time to any but his assignees; the
same effect follows a voluntary assignment: both operate to transfer
the property itself; whereas the priority of the United States attaches
only after the transfer is made bir the party, or by operation of law
at his death. If then the lien of a corporation attaches to an
actual transfer of the stock, so as to make it subject to all'their
equitable demands upon, it; -afortiori, it must remain on it when
a preferred creditor can claim payment only out of the proceeds in
the hands of.the assignees, or personal reresentatives of the debtor.
So long, then, as this note remains due and unpaid, the complainants are not entitled to a transfer of the stock owned by their testator,
But they allege that the debt is extinguished by the verdict in
their favour, rendered %ina plea of the statute of limitations.
In the Bank of.the United States v. Donnelly, 8 Peters 361, this
court laid it down as an established principle, that the act of limitations operated only to bar the remedy, not to extinguish the right or
cause of action; and that a judgment on a plea of the statute was
only to bar the remedy on a contract, when sued for in Virginia, as
the limitation act of that state embraced:the one declared on; but
did not operate to extinguish the contract when sued for elsewhere,
or in Kentucky, where by the lex loci it was not affected by any
limitation. lb. 370.
We cannot take this case out of this/established rule: the legal
remedy is barred, but the debt remains as an unextinguished right;
and the bank, when called into a court of equity, may hold to any
equitable lien, or other means in their hands, till it is discharged.
The decree of the circuit court is affirmed.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the circuit court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the county of Washington, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is decreed and ordered
by this court, that the decree of the said circuit-court in this cause
be and the same is hereby affirmed with costs.
