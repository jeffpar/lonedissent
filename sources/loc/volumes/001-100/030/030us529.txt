DE'ENDANT IN ER-

Ifthe particular terms of artich ot partnership are unknown to the public,
they have a right to deal wilh thu i-i, in respect to its business, upon tile
general principles and piesmnptions of limited partnerships of a like nature; and
any special restrictions inthe articles, do not affect them. In such pailnerships,
it is within the general mithority of the partners "to make and endorse notes.
and to obtain -ailvances cml credits for tle husines; ani benefit oi the firn;
and if such was the general usage of trde, thaf authority must be'presmined
to exist; but not to extend to transctions beyond the scope and objects of
the co-partnership.
Partnerships for commercial purposes, for trading with'the wbrld, for buying
and selling from anl to a great number of individuals, are necessarily governed by many general principles which are known to the public; which subserve the purposL3 of justice; and which society is concerned in sustaining.
One of them is, that a man who shares in the profit, although his name may
not be in the firm, is r,.ponsible for all its debts. Another is, that a partner,
certainly the acting paftnei, has power to transact the whole business of the.
firm, whatever that may be; and, consequently, to bind his partners in such
transactions as entirely as himself This is a general power, essential to thewell conducting of. business, which "simulied in thQ existence of a partnership.
When a partnership is formed for a particular purpose, it isunderstood to be in
itself a grnt of power to the acting members of the company, to transact its
business in the usual way. If that business be to buy and sell, then the individual buys and sells for the company; and every person with whom he
trades in the way of its business, has a right to consider him as the company,
whoever may compose it. It is usual to buy and sell on credit; and if it be so,
the partner who purchases on credit, in 'the name of the firm, must bind the
firm. This is a general authority held out to the world, and to which the
world has a right to trust.
The trading world, with whom the company is in'perpetual intercourse, cannot
individually examine the articles of partnership; but must trust to the general powers contained in all partnerships, The anting partners are identified
with the company; and have power tw'conduct its usual business, in the usual
way. This power is conferred by entering into the partnership, and is per.
haps never to be f6und in the articles. If it iksto be restrained, fair dealing
requirei that the restriction should be made known. These stipulations may
bind the partners, but ought not to affect those to whom they are unknown,
and who trust to the general and well established'commercial law.
The responsibility of unavowed partners, depends on the general principle of
commercial law, not on the particular stipulations of the articles.
If promissory notes are offered for discount at a bank in the usual course of
the business of a partnership, by the partner entrusted fo conduct the business

of the partnership, and are liscounted by the bank, and such discount was'
within such business, the subsequent misapplication of the money; the holders
not being parties or privy thereto; or of the intention to misapply the money;
would notbe deprived of their right of action against the dormant partners in
uch a co-partnership.

ERROR to the ciicuit court of the United States for the
district of Massachusetts.
This was anaction of assumpsit brought by the defendants in,
error against John Winship, Amos Binney, and John Binney,
the present plaintiffs in error, as co-partners, under the name
of John Winship.
The declaration contained seveii counts, six of which set
forth six -different promissory notes, describing them. The
notes were of different dates and amounts, drawn by Samuel
Jacques, Jun. and. payable to, and endorsed by John Winship, Jun.: the declaration alleging the notes To be pdyable to
Amos Binney, John Binney and John Winship, Jun. by the
name and description of John Winship, and so endorsed to
the Bank of the. United States. Demand and notice were alleged to have been dlly made. The "sevenih count was for
fourteen thousand dollars, money lent.
The defendants pleaded the general issue. The plaintiffs
below offered the testimony of Samuel Jacques, Jun. the drawer
of the'notes, which evidence was objected to on the following
facts: on the 28th day of August 1825, Samuel Jacques, Jun:
having failed in business, made an assignment of his property ta Samuel Etheridge and Henry Jacques, in trust for
the payment of his debts, and among them of the claims which
John Winship might have upon him on the promissory notes
stated ivthis declaration. These notes are thus described:
,And among the creditors in this schedule, are also to be
included banks- and individuals, who are or may become
_holders of any of the notes in the following list, which have
either been made by Samuel Jacques; Jun. -as promissor, and
John Wibshipas indorser, or by saidWinship as promissor, and
said Jacques as indorser; but such banks or holders are to be
considered creditors for the purpbses of this instrument, only
for such part of the contents of such notes as came to said
Jacques's use and possession, but for no more; and the assignees
are to that extent, to indemnify said Winsbip .for said proportion of said notes pro rata with other creditors of this class,

JANUARY TERM 1831
EWinship eta!. ',s. The Bank of the United States.]

and said Winship may execute this instrument as representing his interest in said notes when paid."
"1And accounts betweei said Samuel Jacques, Jun. and said
Winship, touching former transactions; are to be adjusted;
and the balance, if in favour of said Jacques, is to go towards
the indemnity above provided for said Winship, and if in favour of said Winship, is to be a debt in this second class of
debts, as abov6 stated."
Then follows a schedule of the notes drawn by Samuel Jacques, Jun. in favoui of John Winship, amounting to 14,250 dollars, and of three notes drawn by John Winship in favour of
Samuel Jacques, Jun. amounting to 4200 dollars.
John Winship was, with other -creditors of Jacques, a party
to this assignment, and released the assignor in these terms :
' The creditors of the said Samuel Jacques, Jun. do hereby consent to and accept this assignment, and in consideration of the
same, and of the covena.nts of the s.aid Samuel Etheridge and
Henry Jacques herein contained, for themselres respectively andtheir respective heirs, executors, administrators, and
assigns, have hereby demised, released, and forever quit claim
to the said Samuel Jacques, Jun. his executors and administra"ors, all claims, demands, and causes of action ,hieh they
have, or may hereafter have, for, or on account bf the several
debts and sums of money set opposite to their respective
names on schedule, and do hereby acquit and discharge him
-and them therefrom."
The court overruled the objection to the admission of Jacques; and he testified, - that he knew of the existence of a copartnership between the defendants by general reputation, but
had never seen any articles of agreement between them ; he
considered that the Binneys were concerned with Winship in
the.soap and candle business, and he knew that it was generally
so understood ; that Winship-did no other business to his knowledge : that he and Winship both lived in Charlestown, and
saw each other every day : that he had dealings with Winship
soon after the commencement of the partnership, and supplied
him with rosin-perhaps to the amount of 400 or 500
dollars per year, sometimes more and 'sometimes less. And
that he sometimes gave a note for the balance'tigned John Winship : that witness always took-such notes on the credit of the

SUPREME COURT.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

Binneys, with -full confidence that they were interested and
were men of property.
"And. at some time in the year 1823, and perhaps a little
preViously, and until 1825, witness and Winship were in the
habit of exchanging notes, which were discounted at the different banks ; they, began at the Manufa6turers' Bank; there
were none at the Branch Bank till 1824. They began with
small notes, -and finally exchanged notes. for 2000 and
2500 dollars, sometimes signed by one and ,indorsed by the
other, and vice versa. These notes were discounted at the dif'ferent banks, but that he believed that none were discounted
at the United 'States' Bank, until, at later periods ; and that
Winship usually applied for the discounts. That he, Jacques,
indorsed these notes, on the credit of the firm. That Winship
always -represented them to be for the partnership apcount, and
that witness never understood that they were on his private
account.
"1The notes in suit were generally presented by Winship for
'discount, but that witness might have presented some of them;
" There were some notes for his private account$ but that
he believed those in suit to have been for the firm.
"cHe could nbt state what portion of the money obtained on
these notes he had received; but that as he and Winship exchanged notes; he could not ,say that he never received'
any-oi it. Some of those notes were given for renewals at
this bank, and some To take up notes at other banks.
"It was his impression that some of the money thus obtained went to pay for rosin; and that one of them for 1500
dollars was originally made to take up a. note which had been
previously given at the Manufacturers' and Mechanics' "Bank
for rosin, being a material used in defendant's factory. -He
knew no particulars concerning the appropriation of the moneys obtained upon these notes, and knows of no other which
Winship has made, but for the use of the firm.
"The business of the firm reqciired a great capital, and
Winship often spoke of buying barilla and tallow for the factory; but that witness does not know that he alluded to these
paiticular notes, nor that the proceeds of them were applied to
any other business.
"This business of exchangina notes continued.until 1825,.

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et al.w. The Bank of the'United States.]

when he and Winship stopped payment Winship kept a
little notebook, but witness having great confidence in him
kept no accurate accountq.
"'The particular occasion of witness stopping payment was
the non-payment of his acceptance on a draft drawn on him by
Winship for barilla, an artidle such as is used in the factory.
He told Mr A. Binney of it, who said he would do nothing about
it. He furnished the factory of defendarits with'rosin,. from
1822 'to 1825; he sometimes might have received payment
in cash, but it was generally in notes. He has endeavoured.
to trace- the origin of the notes in suit, but can trace only
two; that of eight hundred dollars and one of eight hundred and six dollars, originally given for rosin, were eventually
included in thh notes in suit, for one thousand nine hundrea1
dollars, by means of successive renewals. Winship sometimes
came to witness, and stated that he wanted his name instead of
Amos Binney, because he was absent; and got his name accordingly. He has a memorandum in his note book, bf August 15tb, 1825, stating that Winship applied to him to take
up a note of Amos Binney, of that date, for one thousand five
hundred dollars, stating that he was out' of town. This note
originated 9th of Oct6ber 1824, and was at first for two thousand dollars, 'and renewed successively till the 15th of August
1825, when it was. reduced to one thousand fiv& hundred dollars; that the original note was Amos Binney's, not the last
o kie.I
Upon cross examination -hetestified, "'that he had known
John Winship about twenty. or twenty-five years; that he
was in partnership with Messrs Hydes, and that their
names were in good credit, before his contiexion with Binney, and not in extensive business. There are accommodation
notes of this kind,, now outstanding, -amounting to about
twenty-one thousand dollars. No particular agreement ever
subsisted between him and Winship, concerning the proceeds
of these accommodation notes; they sometimes divided
the money and each took a portion. And sometimes he lent
his name to Winship, and Winship lent his name to him. And
at the conclusion of the whole inatter they bundled up all
the notes that had been taken up, and agreed to consider them
,9ssettled and discharged,

SUPREME COURT.
vs. The Bank of the United States.]
[Winship et al.

"And as to the outstanding twenty-one thousand dollars,
he applied to adjust it with Winship, but he said that the papers were all in Binney's hands. He never applied to him
to adjust them., When he went to Winship, the notes and
checks were in a mass, and they agreed to consider them cancelled, to bundle them up :and to pass receipts; and as to the
residue, which were outstanding, that they should be adjusted
as well as they could.
"He has checks of Winship's amounting to about one thousand seven hundred, or two thousand dollars, and some notes;
and that Messrs Binneys hold notes and checks signed by him,
and'given to them by Winship.
cc He was engaged in an extensive speculation in hops; was
indebted and mortgaged his estates in 1824 to Messrs Thomson, for about ten thousand dollars. He never knew any actual
use, for the benefit of the firm, for money obtained on the accommodation notes, unless the taking up of the rosin notes,

as'stated in his testinony, be so considered.
"He understood that Winship was engaged in some shipments of the manufactures of the firm, and also of some other
articles, but always supposed them to be on account of the firmi
and Winship always told him so.
"He was called upon to take up one of these accommodation
notes signed by him, and borrowed money of Amos Binney
upon collateral security, by a mortgage of land for that purpose; and nothing "was said to Binney about his.being liable to pay the note, according to his recollection.
"The plaintiffs also introduced the testimony of other witnesses, who among other things stated that they learnt the existence of a co-partnership between Winship and the Binneys,
iry
the soap and candle business, by report, and the declaration
of Winship; but none of them ever learnt it from either of the
Binneys. One witness stated that Winship offered to exhibit
to him the articles of co-partnership; and Parker stated that
the Binneys were engaged in large business as merchants,
and he did not khow that any one ever supposed that they
and Winship were connected, except in the soap and candle
business."
The defendants gave in evidence the articles of agreement
entered into by the defendants at the formation of the co-

(Winship et al. vs. The Bank, of the United States.]

partnership. The agreement was exdeuted on the 25th of
September 1817, and was between Amos Binney and John
BInney of Boston, and John'Win'ship of Charleston, Massachusetts, "9for the manufacture of soap and candles."
Amos and John. Binney agreed to furnish, for that purpose
a capital stock of ten thousand dollars, at such times as the.
same should be required to purchase stock and materials for
carrying-on the 'manufacture, and Winship agreed to conduct
and superintend the same " under the name and firm of.John
Winship;" to keep books open to the inspection of the parties;
exhibit an annual statement of the capital or business,. interest
to be paid on the capital; and the profits to be divided, one half
to Wiughip, and one half to A. and J. Binney, and losses to be
apportioned in the same manner. The agreement was to continue in force for two years, and for a further term if the parties agreed thereto.
The. capital was afterwards increased to twenty thousand
dollars, Amos Binney and John Binney advancing the same
in equal proportions. This was acknowledged by. John
Winship on the back of the agreement.
They also gave in evidence a bond given'by John Winship
to Amos Binney on the 25th day of September 1817, in the penal sum of ten thousand dollars, with the condition following:
','The conditions of this obligation are such, that whereAs
the above bounden John Winship has this day made an. agreement with Amos* Binney and' John Binney, both of Boston
aforesaid, for the purpose of carrying on a manufactory of s9ap
and candles in joint account of the parties aforesaid; and whereas
the said A. Binney hath engaged to e~dbrsc the notes given
by'the said John Winship, foil the purchase ofistock and raw
materials for manufacturing, when necessary to purchase on a
cr*edit, and in consideration of which, the said' lohn Winship
htith engaged not to endorse the notes, paper, or become in any
manner responsible or security for any jerson or persons, other
than the said Amos Binney, for the term of'tivo years fiom.
the first (lay of October one thousand eight hundred and seventeen.
"Now, therefore, if the said John Winship shall faithfully
observe the conditions, and wholly abstain from becoming the
surety or endorser of any person t6 any amount,-other than

SUPREME COURT.
[Winsliip et al. us. The Bank of the United States.]

the same Amos Binney, for the aforesaid term of two years
from the first day of October 1817, then this obligation to b2
void and of no effiect; otherwise to remain in full force and
virtue."
A witness, the clerk of Amos Binney,. testified on the part
of the defendants below, that having all the books and papers
of Winship in his hands after the failure of Winship, he examined them, and could find no entry of any of the notes in
suit, and qoneof which are stated to he renewals, except two,
one for eight hundred-dollars, the other for eight hundred and
six dollars; which in the note book are marked paid. That
regular business notes appear to have been entered in the bobks,
and the payment of them entered in the cash book; but no entries of these accbmmodation notes appear. There are entries
of notes signed by Winship and endorsed by the defendant to
a large amount. Amos Binney advanced very large sums to
pay the debts of the concern, amounting in all to about fortysix thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight dollars; and
the whole amount sunk and lost to Amos and John Binney
was about seventy thousand dollars.
William Fermenter said that he was clerk to Amos and John
Binney from 1814 to 1824, and never heard of any of the accommodation notes of Winship.
Mr Gould stated' that he was foreman in the factory, and
kept the books of the concern in a counting room; that he
never saw John Binney there; nor Amos Binney, more than
once or twice, for the whole time uritil about the time of
the failure. That he had carried on the business since Winship's-failure, and it had been profitable.
And several other witnesses stated, among other things,
that Amos and John Binney were severally engaged in other
extensive business, and in good credit as- merchants; .Amos
Binney being esteemed wealthy.
-The plaintiffs also introduced William Gordon, who testified that he had always understood that there was q co-partnership in the manufacture of soap and candles. That Winship bought real estate, and that it was commonly reported
that he bought and shipped other articles than those used in
the manufactory.
Also, Thomai. R. Thompson, S61omon Harvy, Samuel Ray-

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship eta). vs. The Bank of the United States.]

mond and Thomas Pike; who testified that it was generally
understood that the defendants were co-partners, and that
Winship shipped Articles other than soap and candles, or factory goods. It is not stated that any of the witnesses ever
learnt the existence of the partnership from either of theBinneys.
The first exception tken on the trial in the circuit court; as
stated in the bill of exceptions, was: that the counsel for the defendants insisted that the co-partnership was in contemplation of law a secret. co-partnership, and did not authorize the giving of credit to any other name than that of the
said Winship; but to this the counsel for the plaintiffs did then
and there insist before the said court, that this was an open or
avowed, and not a secretico-partnership. And the presiding
justice of the said court did state his opinion to the jury on this
point, as follows: "4that according to his understanding of the
common meaning of ' secret partnership;' those were deemed
secret, where the existence of certain persons as partners was
not avowed, or made known to the public by any of the partners. That where the partners were all publicly known,
whether this was done by all the parties, or by one only, it
was no longer a secret partnership; for secret partnership was
generally used in contra-distinction to notorious and open partnership: that whether the business was carried on in the name
and firm of one partner only, or of him and company,
would, in this Tespect, make no, difference: that if it was the
intention of the Binneys that their names should be concealed,
and the business of the firm was to be carried on in the name
of Winship only, and yet that Winship, against their wishes,,
in the course of the business of the firm, publicly did avow
and make known the partnership, so that it became notorious
who were the partners; such partnership could not, in the common sense of the terms, be deemed any longer a secret partnership; that if Isecret' in any-sense, it was under such circunistances, using the terms.in a peculiar sense. That, however, nothing important in this case turned upon the meaning
or definition of the terms ' secret partnership;' since the case
must be decided upon the principles of law, applicable to such
a partnership, as this was in fact proved to be. That there
was no stipulation for secrecy a6 to the Binnevs being partVOL. V.-3 S

SUPREME COURT.

ners on the face of the original articles of co-partnership; and
when those articles, by theirown limitation, expired, the question what the partnership was, and how it'
was carried on for
the future; whether upon the same terms as were contained in
the original articles or otherwise, was matter of fact from the
whole evidence; that if the evidence was believed, Winship
constantly avowed the partnership, and that the Binneys were
his partners in the soap and candle manufactory business, and
obtained credit thereby."
But he left the jury to judge for themselves as to the evidence.
Second exception. And the counsel of the defendants
did then and there further insist, that the jury had a right
to infer from the evidence aforesaid, notwithstanding the
entries of shipments in the invoice book kept by said
Winship, that the said Amos Binney and John Binney had no
knowledge thereof; and therefore could not be presumed to
have adopted or ratified the conduct of said Winship making
said shipments. But the presiding judge did then and there
instruct the jury as follows:
"That whether the -said Amos and John Binney, or either
of them, knew of the said entries or not, was matter of fact for
the consideration of the jury, upon all the circumstances of the
case. That ordinarily the presumption was that all the parties had access to the partnershipL books, and might know the
contents thereof But this was a mere presumption from the
ordinary course of business, and might be rebutted by any circumstances whatsoever, which either positively or presumptively repelled any inference of access; such for instance, as
the distance of place in the course of business of the particular
partnership, or any other circumstances raising a presumption
of non-access."
And he left the jury- to draw their own conclusion as to the
knowledge of the Binneys of the entries in the partnership
books from the whole evidence in the case.
Third exception. And the counsel of the defendants did
then and there further insist, that by the tenor of the said recited articles of agreement and bond, the -said Winship had no
right or authority to raise money on the credit of the said firm;
or to bind the firm by his signature for the purpose of borrow-

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

ing money. But.the presiding judge did then and there instruct the jury as follows:
"That if the particular terms of the articles of co-partnership were not known to the public, or to persons dealing with
the firm in the course of the business thereof, they had a right
to deal with the firm, in respect to the business thereof, upon
the general principles and presumptions of limited partnerships
of a like nature; and that any secret and special restrictions
contained in such articles of co-partnership, varying the general rights and authorities of partners in such limited partnerships, and of which they are ignorant, did not affect them.
That the case of Livingston v.9. Roosevelt; 4Johns. Rep. 251,
had been cited by we defendants' counsel, as containing the
true principles of law on this subject; and this court agreed to
the law, as to limited partnership, as therein held by the court.
That it was not denied by the defendants' counsel, and was
asserted in that case, that it was within the scope and authority of partners generally in limited partnerships, to make
and bndorse notes, and to obtain advances and credits for the
business and benefit of the firm; and if such was in fact the ordinary course and usage of trade, the authority must be preumed to exist. The court knew of no rule established to the
contrary. That the authority of one partner in limited partnerships did not extend to bind the other partners in-transactions, or for purposes, beyond the scope and object of such partnerships. That in the present articles of co-partneship, Winship was in effect constitutcd the active partner) and had general authority given him to transact the business of the firm.
That he had so far as respects third persons, dealing with and
trusting the firm, and ignorant of any of the restrictions of sueh
articles, authority to bind the firm, to the same extent and in
the same manner as partners in limited partnerships of a like
nature usually possess, for the objects within the general scope
of such a firm.
"That the articles limited the partnership to a particular period, after which it expired, unless the parties chose to give it
a future existence. That no new written articles were proved
in the case; and the terms and circumstances under which it
was *subsequently carried on, were matters to be decided upon
the whole evidence. The fair presumption was. that it was

SUPREME COURT.
EWinship et a]. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

subsequently carried on on the same terms as before, unless
other facts repelled that presumption. That the bond, executed
at the time of the execution of the articles, ,ought to be considered as a part of the same transaction and contract."
And the said counsel of the'defendants did then and there
further request the court to instruct the said jury, as follows,
to wit:
-First, that if upon the whole evidence they are satisfied that
the co-partnership, proved to have existed between the defendants under the name of John Winship, was known or understood by the plaintiffs to be limited to the manufacturing of
soap and candles, they must find a verdict for the defendants:
unless they are also satisfied that these notes. were given in the
ordinary course of the co-partnership business, oi that the moneys obtained upon them went directly to the use of the firm,
with the consent of Amos Binney and John Binney; and that
if they are satisfied, that any part of these moneys did go to
the use of the firm with such consent, that then they must find
a verdict for the plaintiffs for such part only, and not for the
residue, And
Secondly, that if they are also satisfied that the Messrs
Binneys furnished Winship with sufficient capital and credit
for carrying on the business of the firm, no such consent can
be implied from the mere fact that Winship applied these moneys, or any part of them, to the payment of partnership debts.
But the presiding judge refused to give the instruction first
prayed for, unless with the following limitations, explanations,
and qualifications, viz : " that the defendants, as co-partners,
are not bound to pay the notes sued on, or money borrowed
or advanced, unless the endorsements of the same notes, and
the borrowing of such money, was in the ordinary course of
the business of the firm, for the use andon accoqnt of the firm.
But if the said Winship offered the notes for discount, as notes
of the firm, and for their account, and he was entrusted by the
partnership as the active partner, to conduct the ordinary business of the firm, and the discount of such endorsed notes was
within such business: then, if the plaintiffs discounted the
notes upon the faith of such notes being so offered by the said
Winship, and as binding on the firm, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover; although. Winship should have subsequently

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of tho United States.]

misapplied the funds received from the discount of said notes,
if the plaintiffs were not parties or privy thereto, or of any
such intention. And if Winship borrowed money or procured any advances on the credit and for the use of the firm,
and for purposes connected with the business of, the firm in
like manner, and under like circumstances, and the money was
lent or advanced on the faith and credit of the partnership; the
rponey so borrowed and advanced bound the partnership, and
they were liable to pay therefor: hlthough the same had been
subsequently misapplied by Winship, the lender not being
party or privy thereto, or of any such intention.
And with these limitations, explanations, and qualifications,
he gave the instructions so first prayed for.
And the presiding judge. gave the instructions secondly
prayed for, according to the tenor thereof.
The defendants in the circuit court excepted to"these opinions and decisions of the court; and a verdict and judgment
having been rendered for the plaintiffs, the defendants prosecuted this writ of error.
The case was argued by Mr Sprague, for the plaintiffs in error : and by Mr Sergeant and Mr Webster, for the defendants.
Mr Sprague contended, that Jacques was interested in the
event of the suit, and ought not to have been peitnitted to
testify in the cause. Such was his situation, that if the plaintiffs below did not obtain payment from the defendants, they
could call upon him for the whole amount of the debt, he being the maker of the notesin suit. But, if the defendants were
compelled to pay the same, they could have no remedy over
against him, having discharged him from all liability by a release, executed after the date and before the.maturity of either
note.
It was competent for the parties to enter into such contract; and to make an effectual release as between themselves:
whether Vinship was the holder of the notes at the time, or
had previously -transferred them with his owu' liability as indorser.
Jacques was in failing circumstances; and by a species of
conventional bankruptcy transferred his property to assigneesj
to be appropriated, pro rata, to, those debts from which his

SUPREME COURT.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

creditors should discharge himi by executing the indenture.
That indenture expressly names and identifies the notes in
suit; and declares, 1. That those who are or may 'e holders
thereof may participate in the fund; 2. That the assignees are
to indemnify Winship against his liability as indorser; 3.
That if on a settlement of accounts a balance shall be due
Winship, he is to hold it towards this ipdemnity: and it contains a release, duly and legally executed by Winship, of all
claims or demands which he had, or in any event might have,
on account of these notes. Cited Gibbs vs. Bryant, 1 Pick.

The instructions to the jury, as coitained in the first and
third exceptions, when brought together and compared, and
applied to the same case; will be found to be inconsistent with
each other: and one of them, therefore, must be erroneous.
In the' first instruction, it appears that it having been contended by the counsel for the defendants that this was 4 secret
partnership, and did not authorize the giving credit to any
other name than that of Winship; the court instructed the
jury "that nothing important in this-case turned upon the
meaning of the terms secretpartnership, since the case must
be decided upon the principles of law applicable to such a
partnership as this was in fact proved to be," &c.
In the third exception, it appears, that the counsel for the OIefendant itaving contended that by the tenor of the articles of
agreement and bond, Winship had no right or authority to
raise money on the credit of the firm; the judge instructed the
jury, "that if the particular terms of the articles of copartnership wore not known to the public, or to persons dealing
with the firm in the course of the business thereof, they had
a right to deal with the firm in respect to the business thereof,
upon the general principles, and presumptions of limited partnership of a like nature; and that any secret and special restrictions-contained in such articles of copartnership, varying

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

th' general right and authorities of partners in such limited
partnerships, and of which they are ignorant, do not affect
them.
In the first place, the jury were informed that it was of no
importance for them to determine whether this partnership
was secret as to the business or-not; because their liabilities
were to arise from the terms of the partnership, such as they
should in faat be proved to be; But in the last, they were
instructed that the liabilities of the Binneys are not to be
limited or restricted- to the terms of the partnership, as proved
in this case, but to arise from certain "general principles and
-presumptions."
The latter ruling is correct only in cases of open and avowed
partnerships; and it was most important therefore for the jury
to.determine whether this was secret as to the Binneys, so as
to limit their liabilities to the special terms of their agreement;
or open, so as to subject them to the operation of the presumptions referred to by the court.
And then it becomes of importance to determine whether
another part of the first instructions be correct: that the avowal
of the partnership by Winship, when intended to be kept
secret, and against the will of the Binneys, could extend their
liability.
The legal responsibility of partnership is not to be determined by any classification into limited and unlimited. We
must search deeper, and look to the real nature of the subject.
In strictness there are no unlimited partnerships.: all have their
boundaries. They vary in extent, from a-single joint adventure, to the most enlarged business of general merchants. But
each has its sphere more or less comprehensive: and to that
sphere it is confined.
The general principles of liability are the same in dli; it may.
flow from two sources: one, that credit was given on the faith
of the name of the partner: the other, that he participated in
the consideration of the contract, by its going to the benefit
of the firm.
In the first, if he has authorized his name and credit to be
pledged, he is bound; although the goods purchased or the
money obtained are squandered by his co-partnei, and never
came to the use of the firm. In the other, if he be a secret

SUPREME COURT.
[Winshijet a]. vs. The Dank of the United *States.]

or a dormant partner, and'has never authorized his name or
credit to be pledged; still, if the goods or money have gone
to the partnership funds, they have come to his use;-and he is
bound, not on the ground of previous iuthority given, but
subsequent reception and use.
No man's credit can be pledged except by himself. If it be
by the intervention of another, that other must have authority
from him. When the ground of liability is, that credit was
given to the name, then the liability is co-extensive with the
authority which the partner had to pledge the name. This
power is usually conferred by the avowal of the co-partnership; and is known, limited and defined, by its nature and ex
tent. But it is not always so: a person may avow br profess
himself a general partner, when he is in fact a special partner,
or no partner at all: or, on the other hand, the aathority to use
his name may be more restricted than his interest, or withheld
altogether. In these cases the question is, was the credit ob-"
tained on his name, authorized by him in any manner; if so,
he is a surety from the beginning?
In this case, was Winship authorized to pledge the credit of
the Binneys ? If he was so, the authority must be derived
eithef from the written agreement, or from acts and declarations of the Binneys. It is not derived from the written contract. By that contract, the Binneys furnished the funds,
but limited their liability: first, by its being secret in the name.
of Winship alone; second, by binding Winship not to become
responsible for any other person; third, by Amos Binney
agreeing to indorse Winship's notes for .stock and raw materials when necessary. The court declared these were restrictions on Winship, binding as to those who knew -them.
2. "9Actsand declarations." There were none by the Binneys: if they had avowed the partnership, they would have
been liable according to the iniport of the avowal, and could
not avail themselves of restrictions which the business did not
import.
Winship's declarations were no proof: those who trusted
him did. so on his credit; and if they required' a fuither responsibility they should have demanded the articles, or have
called upon the Binneys. Not only were Win§hip's declarations no evidence, but he could not prove them his co-part-

This judgment hasbeen rendered against the Binneys, wholly
upon the ground that they were liable as avowed co-partners
for debts contracted upon their credit. It is contended, then,
first, that it was important to determine whether they were
avowed co-partners or not. Second; That Winship's avowal,
when int~nde'd by all to be kept secret, cannot extend the
liability of the Binneys. Third; At all events, Winship could
avow only such a partnership as actually existed. He could
not, by misrepresenting it, extend the liabilities of others beyond what they would be if he had stated only the truth.
Fourth; Winship's authority was derived wholly from the
written instrument, which gave him no power to pledge the
credit of the Binneys to any persons; whether such persons
knew the articles of the firm or not. Fifth, no one has any
right or claim against the Binney's except by virtue of the
writings; and of course subject to all their restrictions.
The court were requested to instruct the jury, that unless
these notes were given in the ordinary course of the partnership business, or the money obtained from them went to the
use of the firm, with the consent of Amos and John Binnley,
they are not responsible for their payment. The consent
contemplated might be either direct or indirect, express or
implied. The instructions prayed for show that it was not
intended to be confined to direct or express assent, but might
be implied from the fact of partnership, or the nature*of the
connexion, or any other circumstance from which the law
would raise the implication, or the jury deduce ft. This instruction, thus prayed for, the couirt refused to give, except
with certain limitations, explanations, and qualifications;
but the law being absolutely as set forth in the reqluest, it
was the right of the defendants below to have it so laid down
to th6 jury without limitatipn or qualification.
Mr Sergeant and Mr Webster for the defendants in error.
I. The first question iri this case is, as to the competency
of Jacques as a witness. *Tothe objection -to his admission,
VOL. V.-3 T

SUPREME COURT.
EWinship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

there are several answers. First, the interest of the witness,
if any, was created by the act of the defendants, after the plaintiff had become entitled to his testimony. It is -not in the
power of one party, by any management, to deprive the other
party of the benefit of testimony to which he would have
been otherwise entitled. If this exception is admitted, it will
be the first case in which a witn*ess is declared disqualified by
a release given by one party, when he is called by another.

The principles sustained by these cases are very reasonable.
Second. It does not appear that Winship had any interest arising from the release. The bank could only come inas a creditor
for so much of the proceeds of the notes as went to Jacques's
use. The release was .only co-extensive with this: and if this
were not so, by the terms of the indenture, it would be so from
the nature of the case. The notes therefore did not constitute
a debt by Jacques. It does not appear that any part of the
money raised by these notes went to his use; his being drawer
makes-no difference. It does not therefore appear that there
was any thing upon which the release operated.
Third. This is not such an interest as to disqualify the witness. The interest must be certain and immediate. The distinctions between competency and credibility are known and settled. The bias of a witness is an exception only to his credit.
Winship and Jacques were both answerable to the bank for all
the notes. The liability of Jacques remained whether the bank
recovered or not; His interest consisted in this; that if he
brought in a better debtor, and the bank could get the debt of
that person, the bank might not proceed against him. But
this judgment is no bar to a claim upon him until it shall be
satisfied. His interest is therefore a mere hope that the bank
would satisfy itsjudgment out of its claims upon the.Binneys.
This hope was founded upon the situation of the parties, not ori
their rights.
Reverse the situation of the parties: let Jacques be solventi

[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

would an objection be sustained to his evidence? It is the right
of action which constitutes the interest. Will Jacques gain or
lose by the event of this suit; or can the verdict be given in
evidence for or against him? However minute the interest, it
is equally fatal; and that is a reason for holding the rule strictly.

All the cases cited by the counsel for the plaintiff in error
come within these principles. No one of them 'resembles the
present. In all of them, there was an immediate interest.
II. The instructions given in the circuit court are correct;
those instructions were not a dissertation or treatise on the
law of partnership generally, but are to be considered in reference to the subject before the court and jury. It is contended,
1. That there is no inconsistency between the first and third
exception.
The distinction is obvious between a secret partnership, and
a secret stipulation between partners, limiting the'authority of
each partner. They are essentially different. The substance
of the instructions is resolved into this position; that the act
of one partner within the scope of the partnership business,
and also within the general scope of the authority of partners,
would by law bind the other partners. The law is here laid
down carefully and correctly.
2. The whole matter rests upon two or three general well
established principles. That which constitutes a partnership is the agreement to participate in profit and loss. The
liability of the partners, is a legal consequence of that agreement; it is a construction of law, not a matter of agreement:
and this is equally true of general partnerships and of special
ones; of open partners and of secret partners. Such .is our
law.

SUPREME COURT.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

To ascertain the liability of partners therefore, we do not
look to their agreements or their acts between themselves. It is
not in their power to limit their liability. The intention to
do so is inconsistent with law. The attempt to do so is unavailing. Their agreements are good between themselves: they
are vain as to third persons.
3. The authority of a partner is derived from the law; is a
construction of law. The only limitation is that it must be
within the scope of the partnership. The name is nothing.
If within the scope of a general authority, strangers are not
bound to distinguish. They may be affected by actual
knowledge. The circuit court went as far in behalf of the defendants as the law would warrant.
Taking the whole of the instructions together, there can be
no doubt, if the facts were found correctly by the jury, that
the defendants below were liable. With the facts, the court
here have nothing now to do.
But it was most unequivocally proved: 1. That a partnership was established in 1817, and continued for eight years;
under the agreement and'after the- agreement expired. It
was rather a general-than a special partnership: the business
was general and the establishment permanent.
2. It was an open, not a secret partnership. It was a matter of notoriety.
3. It gave the ordinary authority of a co-partnership to
give notes, &c. The agreement expressly contemplated this.
4. The credit was given to the firm. This is proved by
the evidence of Harris, as well as that of Jacques.
5. Some of these notes are distinctly traced to the business
of the partnership. All the notes were understood to be for
the partnership concerns.
Thus, then, the-ease is no more than an ordinary one of a partnersbip, carried on under the name of one parther; and the use
of an individual name ought to operate against all the partners. It enables them to practise unduly upon third persons:
to obtsin loans without the usual'pledge of a double responsibility- 'In this very case, partnership notes were given in
the ordinary business of the partnership, drawn by Winship,
and, indorsed by Amos Binney, and thus the drawers and indorser were the same persons. This species of partnership

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

produces a confusion, uncertainty, and disputes; and should
receive no favour.
Mr Sprague in reply:
In answer to the position that the bank had a right to
Jacques's testimony, of which they could not be deprived
by the release of Winship, one of the defendants; he argued
first: That it does not appear, that any such right existed before the execution.of the release by Winship, on .the 28th of
August 1825. None of the notes were then payable. Second: Upon a critical examination of all the authorities, it will
be found that the rule contended for extends only to cases
where one party created an iiterest in -the witness, for the purpose of depriving his adversary of the testimony: which, being
a fraud, shall not succeed. It does not apply to a bona fide
contrpet made in the course of business, much less to a 'cas.e
like the present
Mr. Sprague then examined the case of Barlow vs. Doweh,
Skinner 586, and the other cases relied on y the counsel for
the defendanis in:error.
It is said that the interest was created by the act of the defendants. In the first place, it was by a fair and bona fide contract in the course of business, and without adly design to exclude the witness.: This is manifest frdm the facts stated in the
record.
In the next place, it was not the act of the defendants who
are contesting this demand. The Binneys only have an interest to resist this action. The-interest of Winship is adverse to
theirs; as he seeks to reader/them equally'liable with himself.
If he can make them his partners, he thereby transfers one half
of this debt from himself, and throws it upon them. He alone
made this release: the Binneys had no knowledge of it. It
was not a partnership act; and it was an instrument under seal.
So strong is Winship's interest against the Binneys, that itwould exclude him from testifying against them to pr-oye the
partnership. To allow Winship then to create an interest
in Jacques, which would induce him to testify that the Binneys were his partners; is to enable himto bribe the witness
to accomplish his purpose.
It was said that no interest is proved, because it does not

SUPREME COURT.
[Winsbip et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

appear that the money bbtained on the notes went to Jacques's
U Q.

-

He was the first witness, and then appeared to the court
only-as the real maker of the notes. The release created an
interest which his testimony could not purge; and if it could,
his testimony would only show that some of the notes were
for Winship's use.
If Jacques was, as is contended by the counsel for the defendants in error, an accommodation maker, he would have a
direct interest in making the Binneys responsible. He would
thus obtain their liability for his ultimate indemnity; but if
he failed in proving them to be the partners of Winship, he
must rely solely on the insolvent Winship. So that whether
a.real or an accommodation maker, Jacques was so interested
as to be incompetent.
It has been strongly urged, that as satisfaction is necessary
to protect the witness rom the plaintiffs below, he has no
direct and certain interest in the event of this suit; and that
the judgment would not be evidence for him. This is the
first instance in which such a nice and hazardous distinction
has been attempted. It is no where to be found in the books:
no case has ever recognised it: but, on the contrary, decisions
almost innumerable have been made, that ah ihterest, depending
,
not merely on the rendition ofjudgrrcnt, but on judgmet-and
satisfaction, is such a direct and certain interest as to affect the
competency.
It is said the plaintiffs -maynever enforce the judgment, and
therefore the interest is not certain. This uncertainty is only
as to the acts of the party, not as to the operation of law; and
it is always uncertain whether a, party will pursue his case to
judgment and execution. But still the witness is excluded;
because, if the plaintiff should follow up his legal rights, an interest would accrue. It is certain that the law gives the power to the party, and it is to be presumed that he will exercise it.
In nearly all the cases cited in -the opening, judgment alone
would be inefficacious; but satisfaction was also necessary to
create the rights or liability of the-witness.
It is insisted that dormant partners are equally liable when
discovered, as if the debts had been originally contracted upon
the credit of their names : that is, that there is no substantial

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.1

distinction between secret and avowed partnerships. This is
confounding things widely different, and broadly distinguished
by the authorities.
It is true, as to one class of debts, the liability of dorant
partners is equal to that of the avowed partners, where the
property actually came to the use of the firm. There the obligation to pay arises from participation in the consideration ;
but if the property never name to the use of the firm, secret
partners are not liable, although they would have been, if avowed ; because their credit would then have been pledgedIt is said.that the authority of each to bind the"others is a
conclusion of law. This is true, and so is that of every agent
to bind his principal. But it is a conclusion of-law from factsi
and varies or ceases as they change.
The written instruments did not authorize the pledging the
credit of the Binneys to those who knew'their terms. -This
is ruled by the court, and not controverted. If, then, Winship
had exhibited the articles, he could not have bound his co-defendants to the payment of the notes in suit; all his authority
being derived from the articles. Could he by suppressing
them -enlarge his own powers? Could he, by a suppressio veri,
clothe himself with an authority which no one had imparted?
If he could suppress thelimitations upon the special partnership, why might he not also the restrictions upon -the general?
Why not merely declare himself a partnergenerally,And bind
his associates upon the principles and presumptions arising from
the general partfiership thus avowed?
Each member stands in the same relation .to the firm as an
agent to his-principal, and the authority to bind rests upon the
same foundation. Can an agent, then, having no other source
of authority than a -written letter of attorney, e.darge his
power by suppressing the instrument? Can a principal, who has
merely signed a written power, and has neither said nor done
any thing, or caused or suffered or acquiesced in any. act or
declaratibn by any otlfer person, from which authority couldbe deduced, be bound beyond the extent of the power which
he has subscribed, by the mere suppression of the truth by,
the agent.
Where a person is responsible, merely and exclusively by

SUPREME COURT.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

virtue of written articles, can he be rendered liable beyond
the extent of those articles?
Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This was an action brought in the court for the first circuit
and district for Massachusetts," against John Winship, Amos
Binney and Johri Binney, merchants and paitners, trading under the name and firm of John Winship, as indorser of several
promissory notes, made by Samuel Jacques, Jun. At the trial
the maker was called by the plaintiffs, and sworn. He was objected to by the defendants as an interested witness, an instrument being produced purporting to be a release in the name of
John.Winship of all liability of the maker on the said notes.
The operation of the said instrument, as a release -of the notes
in suit, was controverted by the plaintiffs. It is unnecessary
to state the instrument, or to discuss the question arising on it,
or on the competency of the witness; because the court is
divided on the effect of the instrument and on the competency
of the witness.
The witness testified that he knew from general reputation
that the defendant, John Winship, was concerned with the
other defendants, Agios and John Binney, in the soap and candle business; that Winship avowed the partnership; that he
had dealings with Winship soon after its commencement, and
supplied him with rosin, for which he- sometimes -gave a note
signed John Winship, which the witnes always took on the
credit of the Binneys. Winship and the witness were in the
habit of lending their names to each other, and Winship arways represented that the notes made or indorsed by the witness for his accommodation were for the use of the firm.
Several other witnesses were examined on the part of the
plaintiff to prove the partnership, whose testimony was rendered unimportant by the production of the articles themselyes. The defendants exhibited them, and they are in the
following words:
"The memorandum of an agreement made this twenty-fifth
day of September 1817, bet~veen Amos -Binney and John
Binney of Boston, county of Suffolk, and John Winship, of

JANUARY TERM 1831.

of Massachusetts, for the manufacture of soap and e=ndles,
witnesseth.:
"That the said Amos and John Binney agree to furnish for
the above puipose the sum or capital stock of ten thousand
dollars, at such times as may be wanted to purchase stock or
materials for carrying on the aforesaid manufacture; and the
said John Winship agrees on his part to conduct and superintend the. manufactory, and to pay his whole and undivided attention to the business; to manufacture or cause to be manufactured, every article in the best possible manner, and to use
his utmost skill and exertions to promote the interest of the
establishment, under the name and firm of John Winship, and
without any charge for his personal labours, and to keep a fair.
and regular set of books and accdunts, open and subject at all
times. to the inspection of the parties interested in the concern,
and annually on the first day of October of each year, to make
and exhibit a"statement of the state of. the business, the amount
of purchases and sales, and the profits, if any, of the business,
that have been made; the expenses of conducting the business;
and the profits to be divided in the following manner: to say,
from the profits is to be paid interest for the capital stock of
ten thousand dollars, at the rate of six per centum per annum,
all expenses of rent, labour, transportation, fuel, and utensils,
that it may be necessary to purchase or have, and the remainder of the profits, if any, to be.equally divided between the
said Winship and Binneys, one half thereof to the said John
Winship and the other half to A. and J. Binney; and in case
no profit should be made, but a loss, then the loss is to be borne
and sustained one half by the said A. and J. Binney, and the
other half by the said John Winship,
"The agreement to continue in force for two years from the
first day of October next ensuing, and then for a further term,
provided all parties agree thereto. And to the true and faithful performance of the foregoing conditions each party bind
themselves to the other in the penal sum 6f ten thousand dollars."
On the back of which were receipts signed by said Winship, acknowledging that he had received of Amos Binney
one thousand dollars on the 6th of September 1817, and four

VoL. V.-3 U

SUPREME COURT
[Winship et al"

thousand dollars on the 9th of October 1817; and on the 27th
of December 1827 he had in his hands ten thousand dollars, as
said Amos's proportion of the capital; and that he had received
of John Binney two thousand five hundred dollars on the 1st
of October 1817, and five hundred dollars on the 3d of November 1817, and five hundred dollars on the 17th of November 1817, and one thousand five hundred dollars on the 13th
of June 1820, and on the 2d of June 1821, he had in his
hands ten thousand dollars, as said John's proportion of the
capital stock.
They also gave in evidence a bond given by said Winship
to said Amos, on the 25th of September 1817, in the penal
sum of ten thousand dollars, with the condition following:
"The conditions of this obligation are such, that whereas the
above bounden John Winship has this day made an agreement
with Amos Binney and John Binney, both of Boston aforesaid, for. the purpose of carrying on a manufactory of soap
and candles on joint account of the parties aforesaid; and
whereas the said A. Binney hath engaged to indorse the notes
given by the said John Winship, for the purchase of stock
and raw materials for manufacturing, when necessary to purchase on a credit, and in consideration of which the said John
Winship hath engaged not to indorse the. notes, paper, or become in any manner xesponsible or security for any person or
persons other than the said Amos Binney, for the term of two
years from the first day of October 1811'.
"N
Now, therefore, if the said John Winship shall faithfully
observe the conditions, and wholly abstain from becoming the
surety or indorser of any person to any amount other than
the same Amos Binney.for the aforesaid term of two years
from the first day of October 1817, then this obligation to be
void and of no effect; otherwise to remain in full force and
virtue."
The defendants also produced witnesses whose testimony
furnishe4 some foundation for the presumption that the money
arising from the notes, on which the suits were brought, was
not applied by Winship to the purposes of the firm. Other
testimony led to the belief that a part, ifnot the wholq of the
money was so applied. All the notes in suit were discounted
by and applied to the credit of John Winship.

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

The testimony being closed, the counsel for the defendant
insisted, First, "that the said co-partnership between them was,
in contemplation of law, a secret co-partnership, and did not
authorize the giving of credit to any other name than that'of the
said Winshiol;" but to this the counsel for the plaintiffs did
then and there insist before the said court, that this was an
open or avowed, and not a secret co-partnership. And the
presidjng justice of the said court did state his opinion to the
jury on this point, as follows: "That ace6rding to his understanding of the common meaning of ' secret partnership,' thbse
were deemed secret, where the existence of certain persons as
partners was not avowed or made known to the public, by any
of thr partners. That where the partners were all publicly
known, whether this was done by all the partners, or by one
only, it was no longer a secret partnership; for sedret partnership was generally used in contra-distinction to notorious and
open partnership: that whether the business was carried on in
the nan and firm of one partner only, or of him and company,
would, in this respect, make no difference: that if it was the
intention of the Binneys that their names should be concealed,
and the business of the fitm was to be carried on in the name
of Winship only; and yet that Winship, against their wishes,
in the course of the business of the firm, publicly did avow and
make known to the partnership, so that it became notorious
who were the partners; such partnership could-not, in the common sense of the terms, be deemed any longer a secret partnership: that if ' secr.et,' in any sense, it was under such circumstances, using the terms in a peculiar sense. That, however, nothing important in this case turned upon the meaning
or definition of the terms ' secret partnership;' -since the case
must be decided upon the principles of law, applicable to such
a partnerihip, as- this-was in fact proved to be. That there
was no stipulation for secrecy as, to the Binneys being partners, on the face of-the original articles of co-partnership ; and
when those articles, by their own limitation) expired, the question what the partnership was, and how it was carried on for
the future; whether upon the same terms as were contained inthe original articles or otherwise; was matter of fact from the
whole evidence: that if the evidence was' believed, Winship
constantly avowed the partnership, and that the Binneys were

his partners in the soap and candle manufactory business, and
obtained credit thereby."
But he left the jury to judge for themselves as to the evidence.
Second exception. And the said counsel of the defendants
did then and there further insist, that the said jury had a right
to infer from the evidence aforesaid, notwithstanding the
entries of the shipments in the invoice book kept by said
Winship, that the said Amos Binney and John Binney had no
knowledge thereof; and therefore could not be presumed to
have adopted or ratified the conduct of said Winship making
said shipments. But the presiding judge did then and there
instruct the jury as follows:
"That whether the said Amos and John Binney, or either
of them, knew of the said entries or not, was matter of fact
for the consideration of the jury, upon all the circumstances of
the case. That, ordinarily, the presumption was, that all the
parties had access to the partnership books, and might know
the contents thereof. But this was a mere presumption from
the ordinary course of business, and might be rebutted by any
circumstances whatsoever, which either positively or presumptively repelled any inference of access; such for instance, as
the-distance of place in the course of business of the particular
partnership, or any other circumstances raising a.presumption
of non-access."'
And he left the jury to draw their own conclusion as to the
knowledge of the Binneys, of the entries in the partnership
books, from the whole evidence in the case.
Third exception. And the said counsel of the defendants
did then and there further insist) that by the tenor of the said
recited articles of agreement and bond, the said ,Winship had
no right or authority to raise money on the credit of the said
firm, or to bind the firm by his Aignature for the purpose of
borrowing money. But the presiding judge did then and there
instruct the jury as follows:
"That if the particular terms of the articles 6f co-partnership.were not known to the public, or to persons dealing with
the firm in the course of the business thereof, .they had a right
to deal with the firm in respect to the business thereof, upon
the general principles and presumptions of limited partnership

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United Stales.]

of a like nature; and that any secret and special restrictions
contained in such articles of co-partnership, varying the general rights and authorities of partners in such limited partnerships, and of which they are ignorant.,, did not affect them.
That-the case-of Livingston vs. Roosevelt, 4 Johns. Rep. 251,
had been cited by the defendants' counsel as containing the
true principles, of law on this subject; and this court agreed to
the law, as to limited partnership, as therein held by the court.
That it was not denied by the defendants' counsel, and was
asserted in that case, that it was within the scope and authority
of partners, generally, in limited partnerships, to make afid indorse notes, and to obtain advances and 'credits for the business and benefit of the firm; and if such was in fact the ordinary course and usage of trade, the authority must be presumed
to exist. The court knew of no rule established to the contrary. That the-authority of-one partner in limited partnerships did not extend to bind the other partners in transactions,
or for -purposes,'beyond the scope and*object of sqath-partner.ships. That in thepresent articles of copartnership Winship
was in effect constituted the active partner, and had general
authority given him to transact the business of the firm. That
be had, so far as respects third persons, dealing with and trusting the firm, and ignorant of any of the restrictions in such
articles, authority to bind the firm, to the same extent and in
the same manner as partntrs iu limited partnerships of a like
nature usually possess in the business or for the objects within
the general scope of such a firm.
"That the articles limited the partnership to a particular period; after which it expired, unless the parties chose to, give it
a future existence. That no new written articles were proved
in the case, and the terms and circumstadces under which it
was subsequently carfied on, were matters to be decided upon
the whole evidence. The fair presumption was, that i't was
subsequently carried on, on the same terms as before, unless
other facts repelled that prsumption. That the bond execute&
at the time of the execution of the articles ought to be considered as a part of the same transaction and contract."
And the said counsel of the defendants did then and there
further request the' said court to instruct the said jury as follows, to wit:

SUPREME COURT.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

First. That if upon the whole evidence they are satisfied that
the co-partnership, proved to have existed between the defendants, under the name of John Winship, was known or understood by the plaintiffs, to be limited to the manufacturing of
soap and candles, they must find a verdict for the &dfendants,
unless they are also satisfied that these notes were given in the
ordinary course of the co-partnership business, or that the moneys obtained upon them went directly to the use of the firm,
with the consent of Amos Binney and John Binney; and that
if they are satisfied that any part of these moneys did go to
the use of the firm with such consent, that then they must find
aVerdict for the plaintiffs for such part only, and not for the
residue. And,
Secondly. That if they are also satisfied that the Messrs
*Binneys furnished Winship with sufficient capital and credit
for carrying on the business of the firm, no such consent can
be implied from the mere fact that Winship applied these moneys, or any part of them, to the payment of partnership debts.
But the-presiding judge refused to give the instructions
first
prayed for, unless with the following limitations, explanations,
, and qualifications, viz. 6c that the defendants as co-partners
are not bound to pay the notes sued on, or money borrowed
or advanced, unless .the indorsements of the same notes and
the borrowing of such money, was in the ordinary course of
the business of th&firm, for the use and on account of tht firm.
But if the said Winship offered the notes for discount, as notes
of the firm, and for their account, and he was entrusted by the
partnership as the active partner, to conduct the ordinary business of the firm, and the discount of such indorsed notes was
within such-business; then, if the plaintiffs discounted the notes
upon the faith of such notes being so offered by the said Winship, and as binding on the firm, the plaintiffs were entitled to
recover; although Winship should have subsequently misapplied the funds received fronythe discount of said notes; if the
plaintiffs were not parties or privies thereto, or of any such
intention. And if Winship borrowed money or procured any
advances on the credit and for the use of the firm, and for purposes connected with the business of the firm, in, like manner,
and under like circumstances, and money was lent or advanced
on the faith and credit of the partnership, the money so bor-

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et a]. vs. The Bank of the United 9tates.]

rowed and advanced bound the partnership; and they were liable to pay therefor; alth6ugh the same had been subsequently
misapplied by Winship, the lender not being party or privy
thereto, or of any such intention.
And with these limitations, explanations, and qualifications,
he gave the instructions so first prayed for.
And the presiding judge gave the instruction secondly prayed for, according to the tenor thereof.
To these opinions and decisions of the court, the defendants
excepted.
A verdict was found for the plaintiffs, and judgment entered
thereon; which is brought before this court by writ of error.
The exceptions will now be considered. All ibust admit that
the opinion asked in the first instance by the counsel for the
defendant in the circuit court, ought not to have been given.
That court was required to decide on the fact as well as law
of the case, and to say on the whole testimony, that it did not
warrant giving credit to any other name than that of John
Winship. But, though this prayer is clearly not sustainable,
the counsel for the plaintiff in error'contends, that the instructions actually given were erroneous.
The first part of the charge turns chiefly upon the definition
of a secret partnership, which is believed to be correct; but the
judge proceeds to say, that if incorrect, it would have no
influence on the cause; and adds, "that the case must be decided on the principles of law applicable to such a partnership
as this was in fact proved to be;" "that when the original
articles expired by their own limitation, the question what the
partnership was, and how it was carried on for the. future,
the original
whether upon the same terms as were contained in.
article or otherwise, was matter of fact fr6m the whole evidence."
The error supposed to fie committed in this opinion is in the
declaration, that nothing important in this case turned on the
meaning or definition of the -terms "secret partnership.'"
This is not laid down as an abstract proposition, universally
true, but'as being true in this particular case.. The articles
were produced, and the judge declared that the case must
depend on the principles of law applicable to such a partnership as this was in fact This instruction could not, we think,

SUPREME COURT.
[Winsbip-et a]. vs. The Bahk of the United States.]

injure the. plaintiff in error. Its impropriety is supposed to
be made apparentby considering it in connexion with the third
exception.
The second instruction appears to be unexceptionable, and
the counsel for the plaintiff in error is understood not to object
'to it.
The third instruction asked in the circuit court, goes to the
construction- of the articles of co-partnership. The plaintiff
in error contenids, that those articles gave Winship no authority to raise money on the credit of the firm, or to bind it by
his signature, for the purpose of borrowing money.
The instruction given was, that if the particular terms of
the articles were unknown to the public, they had a right to
deal with the firim in respect to the business thereof, upon the
general principles and presumptions of limited partnerships of
a like nature; and that any special restrictions did not affect
them: that in such partnerships, it was within the general
authority of the partners to make and indorse notes, and to
obtain advances and credits for the business and benefit of the
firm; and if such wasthe general usage of trade, the authority
must be presumed to exist- but that it did not extend to transactions beyond the scope and object of the co-partnership.
That in the present articles, Winship was in effect constituted
the active pariner, and has general authority to transact the
business of the firm, and a right to bind the firm in transacting
its ordinary business with persons ignorant of any private restriction, to the same extent that partners in such limited partnerships usually possess.
The amount of the charge is, that if Winship and the two
Binneys composed a joint company for carrying on the soap
and candle business, of which Winship was the acting partner,
he might borrow money for the business on the credit of the
company, in the manner usually practised in such partnerships;
notwithstanding any secret restriction on his powers, in any
agreement between the parties: provided such restriction was
unknown to the lender.
The counsel for the .plaintiff 'in error has objected to this
instruction with great force of reasoning, He contends
very truly, that in fact -scarcely any unlimited partnerships

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

exist. They are more or less extensive; they may extend to
many or to few objects; but all are in some degree limited.
That the liability of a partner arises from pledging his name,
if his name is introduced into the firm, or from receiving profits if he is a secret partner.
No man can be pledged but by himself, If he is to be
bound by another, that other must derive authority from him.
The power of an agent is limited by the-authority given him;
and if he transcends that authority, the act cannot affect his
principal, he acts no longer as an agent. The same principle applies to partners. One binds the others, so far only as
he is the agent of the others.
If the truth of these propositions be admitted, yet their influence on the case may be questioned. Partnerships for commercial purposes; for trading with the world; for buying and
selling from and to a great number of individuals; are necessarily governed by many general principles, which are known
to the public, which subservethe purpose of justice, and which

society is concerned in sustaining.

One of these is, that a

man who shares in the profit, although his name may not be

in the firm, is responsible for all its debts. Another, more
applicable to the subject under consideration, is, that a partner,
certainly the acting partner, has power to transact the whole
business of the firm, whatever that may be, and consequently
to bind his partners in such transactions, as entirely as himself. This is a general power, ssential to the well conducting of business; which is implied In the existence of a partnership. When then a partnership is formed for a particular
purpose, it is understood to be in itself a grant of power to the
acting members of the company to transdct its business in the
usual way. If that business be to buy and sell, then the individual buys aud sells for the company, and every person
with whom'he trades in the way of its business, has a right to
consider him as the company, whoever may compose it. It
is usual to buy and sell on credit; and if it be so, the partner
who purchases on credit in the name of the firm must bind
the firm. This is a general authority held out to the world,
to which the world has a right to trust. The articles of copartnership are perhaps never published. They are rarely
if ever seen, except by the partners themselves. The stiVOL. V.-S V

SUPREME COURT.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

pulations they may contain are to regulate the conduct and
rights of the parties, as between themselves. The trading
world, with whom the company is in perpetual intercourse,
cannot indihidually examine these articles, but mtist trust to
the general powers contained in all partnerships. The adting
partners are identified with the company, and have power to
conduct its usual business, in the usual way. This power is
conferred by-entering into the partnership, and is perhaps
never to be found in the articles. If it is to be restrained, fair
dealiig requires that the restriction should be made known.
These stipulations may bind the partners; but bught not to affect those to wh6m they are unknown, and who trust to the
general and well established commercial law. 2 Hen. Black.
235. 17 Ves. 412. Gow. on Part. 17.
The counsel for the plaintiff in error supposes, that though
these principles may be applicable to an open avowed partnership, they are inapplicable to one that is secret.
Can this distinction be maintained? If it could, there would
be a difference between the responsibility of a dormant partner, and one whose name was to the articles. Buit their responsibility, in all partnership transactions, is admitted- to be
the same. Those who trade with a firm on the credit of individuals whom they believe to be members of it, take upoh
themselves the hazard that their belief is well founded. If
they are mistaken, they must submit to the consequences of
their mistake; if their belief be verified by the fact, their
claims on the partners, who were not ostensible, are as valid
as on those whose names are in the firm.' This distinction
seems to be founded on the idea that, if partners are not openly named, the resort to them must be connected with some
knowledge of the secret stipulations between the partners, which
may be inserted in the articles. But this certainly is not correct. The responsibility of unavowed partners depends on
the general principles of commercial law, not on the particular stipulation of the articles.
It has been supposed, that the principles laid down in the
third instruction, respecting these secret restrictions, are inconsistsaut with the opinion declared in the first; that in this
case, where the. articles were before the court, the question
whether this was in its origin a secret or an avowed partner-

JANUARY TERM 183.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

ship had become unimportant If this inconsistency really
existed, it would not affect the law of the case; unless thejudge
had laid down principles in the one or the other instruction
which might affect.the party injuriously. But it does not
exist. The two instructions were given on different views of
the subject and apply to different objects. The first respected the parties to the fiim, and their liability, whether they
were or were not known as members of it: the last applies to
secret restrictions on the partners, which change the power
held out to the world, by the law of partnership. The meaning of the terms "secret partnership," or the question whether
this did or did not come within the definition of a secfet partnership, might be unimportant; and yet the question whethera private agreement between the partners, limiting their responsibility, was known to a person trusting the firm, might
be.very important.
The propusition of the defendants in the circuit court was,
that Winship had no right or authority to raise money on the
credit of the firm, or to bind the firm by his signature for the
purpose of borrowing money.
This can scarcely be considered as a general question. 'In
the actual state of the commercial world, it is perhaps impossible to conduct the business of any company without credit.
Large purchases are occasionally made on credit; and it is a
question of convenience to be adjusted by the parties, whether
the credit shall be given by the vendc- or obtained at the
bank. If the vendor receives a n6te, he may discount it at the
bank. If, for example, the notes given by Winship to Jacques for rosin to carry on his manufacture, which have been
mentioned by the witness, had been discounted in bank, it
would not have beenf distinguishable from money borrowed in
any othei"form. The judge said, that if it was within the scope
and authority of partners generally, in limited partnerships to
make and indorse notes, and to obtain advances and credits for
the business and bene t of the firm, and if such was in fact the
ordinary course and usage of trade, the authority must be presumed to'exist. Whether this was the fact or not was left to
the jury.
Does any thing in the articles of agreement restrain this general authority?

SUPREME COURT.
[Winship et al. -is. The Bank of the United States.]

The articles state the object of the company to be, the manufacture of soap and candles; the capital stock to be ten
thousand dollars, which sum is to be paid in by Amos and
John Binney; John Winship to conduct and superintend the
manufactory; the name of the firm to be John Winship; the
profit and loss to be divided. They are silent on the subject of borrowing money. If the fact that the Binneys advanced ten thousand dollars for the stock in trade implied a
restriction on the power of the manager to carry on the business on credit, it would be implied in almost every case.
But the bond given by Winship to Amos Binney, which is
admitted by the: judge to constitute a part of the partnership
agreement, is supposed to contain this restriction. The condition of the bond recites that "whereas Amos Binney had
engaged to indorse the notes given by the said John Winship
for the purchase of stock and raw materials for manufacturing,
when necessary to purchase on credit, in consideration of which
the said John Winship hath engaged not to indorse the notes,
paper, or become in any manner responsible or security for
any person or persons, other than the said Amos Binney."
I"Now, if the said John Winship shall faithfully observe the
conditions, and wholly abstain from becoming the surety or
indorser of any person, to any amount, other than the said
Amos Binney, then,?" &c.
The agreement recited, but not inserted in this condition,
that Amos flinney would indorse the notes of Winship when
it should be necessary to purchase on credit; while~it implies
that the power was incident to the act of partnership; was not
in itself a positive restriction on that power. The affirmative
engagement on the part of Amos Binney, that he will indorse,
is not a prohibition on Winship to obtain any other indorser.
The exigencies of trade might require the negotiation of a note
in the absetne of Mr Binney, and this may have been a motive for leaving this subject to the discretion of the acting
partner, If he has abused this confidence, the loss must fall
where it always falls when a partner, acting within his authority, injures his co-partners. If, then, the agreement between Amos Binney and John Winship contains nothing
more than is recited ^in the condition, it contains no inhibition on Winship to negotiate notes in the ordinary course of

JANUARY TERM 1831.

565

[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

business.

The restriction on Winship is not in this recital,

but in bis engagement expressed in the condition of the bond.
He engages not to indorse the notes, paper, or become in
any manner responsible or security for any person or persons,
other than the said Binney.
The obvious import of this engagement is that Winship will
not make himself responsible for another. Had he made an
accommodation note for Jacques; it would have been as much
a violation of this agreement as if he had indorsed it. . The
undertaking is not to indorse notes for another. But this
note is indorsed for himself. It is negotiated in bank in the
name of the firm, and the money is carried to the credit
of the firm. Had not Winship misapplied this money, no.
question would have arisen concerning the liability of his
partners on this note. The stipulation in the bond, not to indorse or become security for another, would not have barred
the action. But, be this as it may, this stipulation between
the parties is a secret restriction on-a power given by commercial law and usage, generally known and understood- which is
obligatory on the parties, but ought not to affect those from'
whom it is concealed.
The counsel for the defendants in the circuit court then
prayed an instruction to the jury, that if they were satisfied
that the partnership was known to the plaintiffs to be limited
to the soap and candle business, they must find -br the defendants; unless they were also satisfied that these notes were given
in the ordinary course of the partnership business, or that the
moneys obtained upon them went, directly to the use of the
firm, with the consent of Amos Binney and John Binney5
and that if they aro satisfied that any part of these moneys did
go to the use the firm with such consent, that then they must
find a verdict for such part only; and not for the residue.
This instruction was not given as asked, but-was given with
"limitations, explanations, and qualifications."?
The judge instructed the jury, in substance, that the defendants were not bound to pay the notes sued on, unless the indorsements thereon were in the ordinary course of the business of the firm, for the use and on account of the firm; but if
they were satisfied that the notes were so offered and discounted, and that the said Winship was entrusted by the partner-hip, as the active partfnfr, to conduct the ordinary }usiness of

SUPREME COURT.
[Winship et Al.vs. Fe Bank of the United States.]

the firm, and the discount of such indorsed notes was within
such business, then the plaintiffs were entitled to recover; although Winship should have subsequently misapplied the
funds, received from the discount of said notes, if the plaintiffs were not parties or privies thereto, or of any such intention.
The plaintiffs in error contend, that the instruction ought to
have been given, as prayed, without any qualification .whatever.
The instruction required is, that although the jury
should be satisfied that the money went to the use of the firm,
they should find for the defendants; unless they should be also
satisfied, that the consent of Amos and John Binney was given
to its being so applied. That is, that a note discounted by the
acting and ostensible partner of a firm for the use of a firm,
the money arising from which was applied to that use, could
not be recovered from the firm, by the holder, unless the application was made with the consent of all the partners.
The counsel f6r the plaintiffs in error is too intelligent to
maintaili this as a gene.'al proposition. He must confine it to
this particular case. He is understood as contending, that under the secret restrictions contained in the bond given by
Winship to Amos Binney, Winship was restrained from discounting these notes even for the use of the firm; and that no
application of the money to the purposes of the co-partneLship
could cure this original want of authority, and create a liability
which the note itself did not create; unless such application
was made with the consent of all the partners. So understood,
it is a repetition of the matter for which the third exception
was taken, and is disposed of with that exception. The instruction, therefore, ought not to have been given as prayed.
Still, if the court has erred in the instruction actually given,
that error ought to be corrected. That inst'uction is, that if
the notes were offered in the usual course of business for the
firm, by the partner entrusted t6 conductits business, and were
so discounted, and if such discount was within such business;
then the subsequent misapplication of the money, the holders
not being parties or privies thereto, or of such intention, would
not deprive them of their right of action against the co-partnership.
. We think this opinion entirely correct. It only affirms the
common principle that 'the misapplication of funds raised by

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States,]

authority, cannot affect the person from whom those funds are
obtained.
We think there is no error in the opinions given by the
judge to the jury. The court being divided, on the competency of Samuel Jacques as a witness. The judgment is, affirmed, with costs and damages at the rate of six per mutum
per annum, by a divided court.
Mr Justice BALDWIN dissenting.
The plaintiffs sue in this case as the indursces of six promissory notes drawn by James Jicques, and indorsed by John
Winship, which came to their hands as the discounters thereof,
being offered by John Winship, and the proceeds thereof
placed to his credit in the bank. They were not notes indorsed
to the plaintiffs in payment, or as collateral security for the
payment of an antecedent debt, or the performance of any
pre-existing contract. The bank are prohibited in their charter from dealing in goods, unless for the sale of such as are
pledged for the payment of debts. 4 L. U.S. 43. Ninth fundamental article of the charter of the bank.
This was not then the case of goods sold by plaintiffs to defendants, as partners, on thefaith of the partiership in the course of
their business. Neither'is it a case of mone y previously lent,
and a note or bill indorsed'over in payment or security. The
case finds, and the circuit court considered it a case of discount,
which is a purchase of the note on stipulated and well known
terms. The purchase or discount of a note is a contract wholly
unconnected with the objects, uses, or application of the money
paid. A party who sells a bill or note, iheurs no liability to
the discounter by the mere contract of discount, where he
does not indorse it: nor does the discounter who pays for the
discounted bill or note in other bills and notes, without indorsement, guaranty their payment. The contract is one of sale;
and in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation, the rights of
the parties are tested exclusively by the only contract which
the nature of the case imports; of sale and purchase as of any
other article in market.
Where a purchase is made or money borro-wed on partnership account, an immediate debt is created: a note or bill given
or indorsed is for payment of the existing debt: and if not

SUPREME COURT.
tWinship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

paid, the debt remains, unless the bill or note has been accepted
as payment. So .if the bill or note is given as collateral security. And the law is the'same, whether one or all the partners
do the act;. there is an antecedent debt binding on all, or an
indemnity to -be provided; the-obligation is not impaired by
giving or transferring an ineffectual security. But thepresent
case is wholly different. The defendants owed no antecedent
debt to the bank, for which these notes were transferred to
them. They were neither offered or accepted as payment or
indemnity; but sold by Winship, and purchased by the bank
at their value. That value is, in my opinion, to be ascertained
with reference to the names on the bill, who are the parties
to the contract, and in my view of the law, the only parties.
The bank bought from John Winship the promise of James
Jacques, guarantied by Winship, on known conditions. This
distinction between passing or pledging a note in payment, and
discounting it, has been wholly overlooked in the opinion of
the circuit court; and the case seems to have been considered
throughout as governed by the same rules which apply to purchases, loans, and other partnership engagements. The case
before them was a pure case of discount, which is governed
by its own principles; which, in my opinion, would have produced a different result in the cause, had they been laid down
to the jury.
These principles .are fully illustrated and established in their
various bearings on cases which have been adjudicated, and
laid down in terms too clear not tor be understood. 15 East's

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winship.et a]. vs. The Bank of the United States.3

Resting on these authorities, I shall consider the case on
the evideaee as one of discount, not of loan, purchase or
any other pre-existing liability. As the evidence of Jacques
proves that these notes were accommodation, and not notes of
business; as Mr Harris, the discount clerk, testifies that all the
notes were 'discounted at Winship's request, and the proceeds
passed to his credit; that it is easy to distinguish accommodation notes from others; and that he considered these in suit to
be of that description; and -that the bank had frequently discounted notes drawn by Winship, and indorsed by Amos Binney: and Mr Parker, one of the directors of the bank, testified,
that when the bank discounted these notes, it was understood
that Amos and John Binney were bound by them. Witness
understood that they were bound as partners in the soap and
candle business, not general partners. Did not know as to
John Binney, whether plaintiff considered him answerable,
but that they did so consider Amos Binney; that a number of
notes of this kind were discounted, while other notes indorsed
by Amos Binney were in bank; tht Amos and John Binney
were engaged in larg business as merchants, and witness does
not know that any one ever supposed defendants to be partners, except in the manufacture of soap andcandles.
I cannot do injustice to the plaintiffs by founding my opinion on this testimony. Mr Parker was present at the making
of the contract of discount of these notes; he was one of the
agents of the bank in making it, and a party to it, as a member
of the corporation, directly interested. His evidence is the
solemn admission on oath of a party to the contract, and ought
to be taken as true. The'defendants have a right to its full
benefit as explanatory of the nature, terms, and circumstances
under which it was made. Mr Harris, the discount clerk, was
the.appropriate agent of the bank in -consummating the contract of discount, by paying to Winship the proceeds of the
discounted notes; and I cannot err in' saying from the record,
that these were the only witnesses examined at the trial touching the discount of these notes; the only contract, in my
opinion, which the law raises between the plaintiffs and defendants. What, then, was the obligation which this contract
of discount, as proved by-Harris and Parker, imposed on
Amos and John Binney, by the bank's purchasing these notes

at the request of John Winship, and paying or passing the
proceeds to his credit?
The notes were accommodation, so understood by the plaintiffs, and discounted as such. The bank, then, knew that they
were not what they purported to be; they are set forth in the
record, are all drawn for value received, and thus bear a falsehood on their face, known to the bank. Such notes, Mr Harris says, are easily distinguishable from notes of business; and
the bank did not discount them as representing a purchase, a
loan, or any pre-existing obligation by Jacques to pay the
amount to Winsiip, but as the lending of his name by Jacques
to Winship, to enable him, to raise money by the sale of the
notes, There was in this respect no fraud on the bank. They
knew they were not purchasing hotes given and indorsed in
the usual course of business. They did not come to their
hands as innocent indorsers, taking them to be what they imported to be, for value received. The bank-are purchasers, it
is true, for a valuable consideration; but not innocent, or without notice. They took the notes with a known taint on their
very face, which can only be effaced by some subsequent indorsee or holder, who takes them in the course of business
without notice, and takes them as'between the payor and payee,
as,having been given for value received. But the plaintiffs
have become the indorsees by discount, knowing that by the
acknowledged principles of commercial law, as between the
original parties in all their relations, Winship was the drawer
and Jacques the indorser. As between them and the bank,
their relations were the same, whether the notes were of business or accommodation: they wer6 liable in the capacitiei they
respectively assumed on fhe face of the notes. When the discounter 'or the indorsee of an accommodation note, known by
him to be such, seeks to recover the amount from a person
whose name does not appear on the note, he.must prove that
the person charged had made himself a party to the note; had
authorized its negotiation or transfer, previously, or afterwards
assented to, ratified, or adopted the indorsement as his own.
Had there been no previous connexion between the Binneys
and Winship, and the Binneys bad procured the discount from
the bank without their indorsement, they would be no more
answerable to the bank than by receiving payment of a check.

JANUARY TERM

[Winsbip et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

On the face of these notes the Binneys are strangers to the
bank. The contract of discount which they made with Winship, does not, per se, create one with the Binneys. Being accommodation notes, they were discounted as such; that is, as the
notes of Winship indorsed by Jacques; for such is the acknowledged character of such notes in the commercial world. The
line separating business from accommodation paper, is clearly
defined by law and usage.. There is the same difference between the indorser of a note known not to be what it purports
to be, and one which represents a real debt from the drawer
to the drawee, as between the purchasers of real estate with
or without notice of an incumbrance, or the defect of title; so
far as respects their standing in courts of justice, in relation
to third persons, nQt parties to the contract. Those who purchase in good faith, without notice of fraud, and pay.their
money, confiding in the face of the transaction, ignorant of
any thing which can affect its legal or equitable character, are
entitled to the protection of all courts as their most favoured
parties.
A peculiar sanctity is thrown round the obligation of negotiable paper, actually negotiated in the usual-course of business,
and in the hands of an innocent holder, for a valuable consideration, without notice. Every presumption which the law car
raise, is in favour of such a holder, whether he receives the note
in payment, or bydiscount. It becomes divested of this peculiar
obligation when the paper in its original concoction or neotiation becomes divested of these attributes, and remains in the
hands of a holder who has a knowledge of all the circumstances
attending both. I know of no,decision of apy court, no principle of law, nor usage of merchants, which confounds the distinction between these two kinds of paper in the hands of indorsees, with or without notice; it is too well established to
require support from argument or authority. The same distinction exists in paper negotiated after it is due, or partnership notes given for the private debt of a partner. Notice is
the distinguishing criterion in all these cases, and settles the
question as to the burthen of proof. So I find the law laid
down by tie supreme court of Massachusetts, in the case of
the Manufacturing and Mechanics.' Bank vs. John Winship,
et al. 5 Pickering,. 1.
The suit wag brought on an accom-

[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

modation note drawn by John Winship to Jacques or order,
indorsed by him and discounted by ,the plaintiffs in the usual
course of banking business. The chief justice charged the
jury, that the burthen of proof wus in the plaintiffs; and that if
no proof was given by them that the money was raised for
the business of the firm at the manufactory, the jury should
find the fact for the defendants. In giving judgment for the
defendants, the court affirmed the charge of the chief justice as
to the burthen of proving the note to have been given dn
partnership account being on the bank; that no recovery
could be had agaihst the partners, so long as it remained
doubtful whether they have or. have not made the contract
declared upon; that from the fact of the note being found to
be .an accommodation one between Winship and Jacques, it
would seem more likely that it related to the private concerns of
Winship than to those of the partners; at any rate, the uncer.tainty resting on the face of the note would still continue.
The plaintiffs knew or might have known that Winship was
openly engaged in commercial speculations, which were
wholly unconnected with the business of the manufactory;
and that his signature might relate to one concern as well as
another. If, therefore, they meant th it the note should be
eiforced against the partnership, they should have ascertained
that the signature of Winship was intended for the signature of the firm. But they made no such inquiry, and it does
not appear that Winship or Jacques ever made any representation to that effect. And although it appears that the
plaintiffs supposed the Binneys would be answerable, because
they were partners with Winship in the manufactory, yet
they gave no intimation whatever to the parties to the note
to be discounted, that such was their understanding of the
contract.
There are few courts whose opinions may be more safely
confidedlin, as to the rules of the common law; there is none
wlfiose authority I feel more bound to respect, as to the common law of Mdssachusetts, than its highest judicial tribunal.
The law of the state where a contract is made and carried into
effect, Aeems to me to be the law which must control its obligation; and until evidence of the common law of that state

[Winship et'al. vs. The Bank or the United States.]

is furnished me, I feel it my duty to respect and adopt-it: believing that in doing so, I violate no principle 'Which has
ever been sanctioned by this court. In some particulars the
evidence in the cause rdferred to was more favourable to the
bank than in this. The note was discounted at the bank, on
the belief that the Binneys were liable as partners of the
manufactory at Charlestown only. This was found by the
jury: but it was not found, and there appears to have been no
evidence that the bank or its officers knew the note to be an
accommodation one. The judgment of the court was on the
fact being so found, not on its being known to the plaifitiffs.
In this case the notice is brought home to the plaintiffs by
the evidence of their discount clerk. TvIr Parker, the director, does not say the note was discounted on the belief that the
Binneys were liable as partners; all he says on that subject is,
when the bank discounted these notes, it was understood the
Binne,,s were bound by them. He immediately corrects
this, and says, he does not know as to John.Binney, whether
plaintiffs considered him answerable;. but they did so consider
Amos Binney. This is certainly very lame evidence of 'the
notes being discounted on the credit of both Amos and John
Binney; and much weaker than the fact found by the jury in
the other case. The bank had notice of the course of business between Winship and Amos Binney, byhisindorsing Winship's notes, and the bank discounting them. The Binneys
were in good credit; and being reputed wealthy, it was not to
be presumed they would borrow credit from Jacques. These
cireumstances ought to have put the bank on inquiry, as
Binney was a customer residing in the place. The court
placed no reliance on these circumstances, or on the fact of
the notes being discounted with the knowledge that they
were notes of accommodation.
Nor did the court, in my opinion, correctly define the
difference between a dormant and an open partnership. It
seems to me tobe this: where the names of the partners do or
do not appear in their accounts, their advertisements or their
paper; where the business is carried on in the name of all,
it is open; but if any are kept back, it is dormant: that the
knowledge which the public may have is not the test,
when it is acquired froin the acts or declarations of the acting

SUPREME COURT.
[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

avowed partners: it may enable them-to reach the dormant
one, if the transaction is one in which he had an interest, but
does not alter its nature. The partnership remains dormant
as to all, whose names do not appear on its transactions. The
dormant, the sleeping, inactive partner may be known by reputation, or the declaration of his co-partner, but these do not
make him an avowed or active one without the avowal and
pledge of his name or paper. If credit is given to the other
names on the faith of such reputation or representation, the
persons so trusting must do it at the risk of suffering, if their
information is not true. The declarations of one of a firm are
not evidence of another person's being a partner, in any particular transaction, unless a previous connexion is established,
which gives him authority to bind by his acknowledgement, or
proofgiven of subsequent assent: reputation is not, per 8e, evidence,unless broughthometo the party charged; then his silence
may be deemed acquiescence or assent. 11 Serg. and Rawle,

The language of some ot th6 cases is, that it is rather on the
ground of agency, than partnership resulting from the comrnunity of interest in the subject matter of the contract. The
principle which makes a dormant partner liable is this: having
an interest in the profits which are a part of the fund to which
a creditor looks for payment, he shall be bound. 2 Black.

-Black. 45, &c. As his name is not pledged, his liability arises
only from his interest, 16 East. 174, 175; and the burden of
proving such interest is on the party suing. The language of
the court, in 2 Nott and M'Cord, 429, is very emphatic.
"To charge defendant as partner, one of two things is necessary; either he must have permitted his name to be used as
one of the firm, thereby holding it out as a security to the
community; or he must have participated in the profits." As
the Binneys never pledged their names on these notes, they
were not, discounted on their faith. There is then wanting in
this case tfiat fact on which the p6wer of one-partner to bind
the firm by negotiable paper is created, the use of the names.

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Winsbip et &L.vs. The Bank of the United States.]

The plaintiff who seeks to make those parties to a note, whose
names do not give it currency or credit, must make them parties by affirmative proof of an interest in profits, previous authority, or subsequent recognition. It is true, that when a
dormant partner is discovered, he is liable; but then he must
be shown to be one by an interest in the subject matter of the
note. Till this is brought home to him, he is no party to it. I
know of no authority for saying, that the mere existence of a
partnership composed of names not avowed or pledged to the
public, makes them when discovered liable for any other than
contracts in which they have an interest; one who suffers his
name to be used on paper is liable as a partner, though there is
in fact no existing partnership; but the man who does not suffer
his name to be used or pledged, is bound only by virtue of his
interest.
This furnishes, I apprehend, the true distinction between
dormant and open partnerships, and that it does not depend on
the knowledge which the public may have, or the representation made by the contracting partner, when* he is giving or
negotiating a note. The reason which makes a note drawn or
indorsed by one partner, in the joint name, though for his own
-use, binding on the firm in the hands of an innocent holder,
is, because it has been taken on the faith of his name. 3 Kent.
Com. 18. The case of Van Ramsdyke's vs. Kane, shows the
importance attached to the names of the partners'appearing on
a bill. One partner was authorized bhy the others to take up
money on the credit of the partnership concern, and draw
bills therefor on a house at A. He took up money, drew a
bill directing it to be charged on the account of all the partners: but -it was signed by himself alone: the court held, that
the representative of a.deceased partner was liable in equity to
a payee, who trusted his money on the faith of the joint credit:
but expressed themselves with great doubt and caution as to
the liability of the partners at law. 2 Gall. R. 30.
It seems to me that the circumstance which would excite a
doubt in that case would remove it in this. But when all the
names are not used, the reason and the law cease together.
Where the liability attaches to the oame, proof of the signature
is enough: where it depends on the mere participation of the

[Wintbip -etal. vs. The Bank of the United Statee.]

-

profits, that must be proved by the holder: as he claims to hold
persons bound whose names were not held out on the paper
as inducements to fake it, he must show that the law has
placed their names upon it. In proving a partnership assignment, it must appear that the party making it had a right to
sign the name of the firm, and that his act is the act of all the
partners. 5 Cranch, 300. A party claiming the money due
on a note, indorsed to him in the name of the firm, must show
the indorsement to be made in the name of the firm by a person duly authorized. 7 Wheat. 669. The case of Leroy vs.
Jnhnson in this court 1 Peters, 186, was this. Hoffman and
Johnson were partners, under the firm of Hoffman and Johnson;-so-advertised in the papers, so publicly known, and so
carried on, under articles of partnership. Hoffman drew a
bill on London, in Alexandria, in his own name, which the
plaintiff, residing in New York, purchased from Hoffman.
The bill was drawn to raise money to pay anote of the firm,
and sent to New York by Johnson for the purpose of selling
it. Not succeeding, Hoffman' went on, and assisted by letters
of recommendation from merchants of Baltimore, negotiated
the bill, and with the proceeds paid a partnership note. The
circuit court of the district were asked to instruct the jury,
1. That on the evidence of partnership and the application of
the proceeds of the bill to partnership purposes; 2. That if the
bill was drawn with reference to the business of the concern;
3,-That if the name of Jacob Hoffman was sometimes used in
relation to the business of the firm, that the bill was drawn in
his name, and so negotiated for the firm, and to pay their.
debts: that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. These instructions were refused, and judgment rendered for the defendant,
which was afirmed: this court holding it indispensable for
the plaintiff to prove, that the name of Hoffman was used in
the transaction as the name of the firm, and that the parties so
.traded and carried on their business; that the jury would be
well warranted from the facts bf the case in believing that
Hoffman dealt in his individual name, and on his sole re-.
sponsibility, without even an allusion to the partnership;
though the bill was drawn for partnerslip purposes, With the
knowledge of Johnson, and by him sent to New York for sale,

JANUARY TERM 1891.
[Winship et a].
vs. The'Bank of the United States.]

and the proceeds applied in good faith. The attention of the
court was not drawn to the distinetioii between notes disdounted, and those received in payment; nor was the bill in
question an accommodation one. There was no fraud in the
transaction, as between the partners. It was drawn, negotiated,
and the proceeds applied, with the consent of both, and the aid
of letters of recommendation. It came to the hands of the
holder by fair purchase in market, in the usual and regular way
of businessj yet Johnson was not bound: his name was not on
the bill; the plaintiff did not prove it to be the name of the
firm in the paiticular transaction, though Ioffman's name was
sometimes used alone in partnership transactions.
If, n addition to these defects in the plaintiff's case, it had
appeared that the bill drawn in the name of Hoffman had been
one of accommodation, known to Le Roy to be so, and purchased as such, without the knowledge of Johnson of its having been drawn or negotiated, or the application of its proceeds
to partnership purposes, and with a knowledge by Mr Le Roy,
derived from his having been in the frequent habit of discounting bills drawn by one and discounted by the other, understanding there was a special partnership between them; it is
not presuming too much to think, that this court would have
deemed -thesecireunatances strong presumptive proof and reasonable notice of their accustomed mode of raising money for
partnership purposes, by discount; and that a known accommodation note drawn by a stranger, and indorsed by Hoffman
alone, was riot a partnership note, when offered by him.for discount, without the name of Johnson. It would seem to me to
furnish the very case which this court, in delivering their
opinion in Le Roy v&. Johnson, make a proviso of the liability of the members of a firm, whose names 'appear'on a bill
negotiated, and in the hands of an indorsee. The court say: a
bill drawn or accepted by a firm, by their usual name and style i
is presumed to be on their joint account and authority, and
that third persons are not bound to inquire whether it was so
done or not, "9unless the contrary be shown, and that the persons with whom the partner deals had notice or reason to believe that the former was acting on his separate account."
This restriction to the liability of partners, whose names apVOL. V.-3 X

[Winship et al. vs. The Bank of the United States.]

pear on a joint note in the hands of an indorsee, to whom the
faith of a partnership is publicly pledged, seems to me conclusive in a case circumstanced like this; where the agents, who
effect the discount of the note in question for the bank, prove
distinctly their own knowledge of the nature, extent and objects of the partnership, the mode adopted to raise funds for
the firm in the same bank, and of these notes being for the accommodation of Winship, and his receiving the proceeds.
Under the circumstances of this case, I cannot consider the
plaintiffs as innocent indorsees of the negotiable paper of a
firm actually negotiated by them on its pledged credit, without notice or reason to believe that Winship was acting on his
separate account. The testimony of Harris is conclusive on
my mind to prove, that the officers of the bank perfectly understood the nature ofthe transaction; that the notes were not
discounted on any representation made by Winship, or on the
belief that they were the notes of the firm. The bank may
have thought the Binneys, or one of them, liable; but accordirng to the testimony of Parker, could not have believed the
indorsement to represent a regular and authorized partnership
transaction. The statement of Mr Parker was at first that
they understood the Binneys were liable, but he afterwards
corrected himself and said, he did not know, as to John Binney, whether the plaintiffs considered him so answerable, but
that they so considered Amos Binney. They evidently
thought Amos liable because he had been in the habit of indorsing Winship's notes, but could by no possibility have believed Amos and John liable as partners under the signature
of Winship, when one of the directors who made the discount could not say that the bank ever considered ohn Binney to be liable.
Finding, on a careful examination of the charge of the circuit court, that none of the restrictions and qualifications of
the liability of a dormant partner, whose name does not appear.-in an indorsement of-an accommodation note, discounted'
under known circumstances of suspicion, have been laid down
or explained to the jury; I im constrained to say that it is erroneous, and that the judgment ought to be reversed. I cannot, on a subject so important as this, silently dissent from the
opinion of the court, when my.judgment has been made up on

what seems to me the best established principles of commercial law: nor can I consent to overrule a decision of the supreme court of the state where this contract was made, executed and enforced; without the highest possible evidence of
their having been mistaken in their judicial exposition of their
common law.
