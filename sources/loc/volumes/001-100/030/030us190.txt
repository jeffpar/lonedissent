THE MATTER OF JAMES JACKSXOX EX DEM. OF JOHN JACOB
ASTOR AND OTHERS vs. NATaANIEL CRANE AND JAMES
JACKSON, EX DEM. Of JOHN JACOB ASTOR AND 'OTHERS VS.
SAMUEL KELLY.

The supreme court has power to issue a mandamus directed to a circuit court of
the United States, commanding the court to sigh a bill of exceptions in a case
tried before such court.
In England the writ of mandamus is defined to be a command issuing in theking's
name from the court of king's bench, and directed to any person, corporation
or inferior court of judicature within the king's domini6ns, requiring them to
do some particular thing therein specified, which appertains to their office and
duty, and which the court of king's bench has previously determined or at least
supposes to be consonant to right and justice. It issues to the, judges of any
inferior couxtcommanding them to do justice according to the powers of their
office, wherever the same in delayed. It is apparent that this definition and
this description of the purposes to which It is applicable by the court of king's
bench, as supervising the conduct of inferior tribunals, extends to the case of
a refusal by an inferior court to sign a bill of excrptions, where it is an act
which appertains to their office and. duty, and which the court of king's bench
supposes '!to be consonant to right and justice."
The judicial act, section 13, enacts that the supreme court shall have power to
issue writs of prohibition to the district courts, when proceeding as courts of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and writs of mandamus in cases warranted
by the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed, or persons holding offices under the authority of the United States'. A mandamus to an officer is said to be the exercise of original jurisdiction, but a mandamus to an interior court of the United States is in the nature of appellate jurisdiction. A
bill ofexceptionsisamode of placing the law of the case on a record, wb;cb
is to be brought beforethis court by writ.of error.
That a mandamus to sign a bill of exceptions is "warranted by the principles
and usages of law," is, we think, satisfactorily proved by the fact that it is given
in England by statute; for the writ given by the statute of Westminister, the
second, is so in fact, and is so termed in the books. The judicial act sr " :3 el
usages of law generally, not of common law. In England it is awarded by the
chancellor, but in the United States it is conferred expressly on this coutt;
which exercises both common law, andtchancery powers, is invested with appellate power, and exercises extensive control over 0]1 the courts of the
United States. We cannot perceive a reason why the single case of the refusal
of an inferior court to sign a bill of "exeepjions, and thus to place the law of the
case on the record, should be withdrawn from that general power to Issue writs
of mandamus to inferior courts, which is contbrred by statute.
The judicial act confers expressly the power of general superintendence ofinferior
courts on this court. No other tribunal exists, by which it can be exercised.

during the trial, cannot ba taken in such a form as to bing the whole charge of
the judge before this court; a charge in which he not only states the results of
the law from the facts, but sums up all the evidence.
The decision of this court in the case of Carver v#. Jackson, ex dem, of Astor,
4 Peters, 80, re.examined and confirmed.

MR Hoffman moved the court for a writ of mandamus to be
directed to the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York in the second circuit, commanding
that court to review its settlement of certahi bills of exceptions, which were tendered on the part of the defendants on the
trials of those cases in the circuit court, and to correct, settle
and allow, and insert in, the said bills, the charges to the jury
in each case, or the substance thereof; and also for such other
and further order and relief in the premises, as the court
shall deem just and proper.
This motion was made after notice to the plaintiffs in the
ejectments, and was founded on an affidavit made by Green C.
Bronson, Esq. the attorney general of New York, who was of
counsel for the defendants in the circuit court, a copy of which
affidavit had been served upon the counsel for the plaintiffs in
the suits.
The facts set forth in the affidavit and. the papers referred
to, are'fully stated in the opinion of the court.
The case was suhmitted to the court, without argument by
Mr Hoffman and Mr Webster for the relators, and by Mr Ogden and Mr Wirt for the plaintilfs in the circuit court.
Mr Chief Justice WARsHALr. delirered ihe opinion of the
Court.
These suits were decided in the court of the United States
for the second circuit and southern district, of New York, in
May term 1830. At the trial the court gave opinions.on seyeral points of law, which were noted at the time, and a right
to except to them reserved. According to the practice ip
New York, bills of exceptions were prepared by counsel invacation, and tendered to the circuit judge for his signature.
The bills comprehend not only the points of law made at the
trial, but the entire charge to the jury. The judge corrected
the bills by striking out his charge to, the jury. This niomiom

is made for a writ of mandamus." to be 4irected to the circuit
court of'the U6nited States for the southern 'distict of New
York in the second circuit, commanding the said circuit court
to review its settlement of the proposed bills of e9ceptions,"
"4and to correct, settle, allow and insert, in the said bills, the
charge delivered, to the said jury in each case, or the substance
thereof."
A doubt has been suggested respecting the power ot the
court to issue this writ. The question was not discussed at
the bar, but has been considered by the judges. It is proper
that it should be settled, and the opinion of the court announced. We have determined that the power exists. Without -ping extensively into this subject, we-think it proper to
state, briefly, the foundation of our opinion.
In England the writ of mandamus is defined to be a command issuing in the king's name, from the court of king's
bench, and directed to any person, Corporation, or inferior
court of judicature within the king's dominions requiring
them to do some particular thing therein specified, which appertains to their office and duty, and which the court of king's
bench has previously determined, or at least supposes t be
consonantto right and justice. Blackstone adds, "that it issues
to the judges of any inferior court, commanding them to do
justice according to the powers of their office, whenever
the same is delayed. For it is the peculiar business of the
court of king's bench to superintend all other inferior tribunals, and'therein to enforce the due exercise of those judicial
or ministerial powers with which the crown or. legislature
have ingested them: and this, not only by restraining their
excesses, but also by quickening their negligence, and obviating their denial of justice." 3 BI. Com.
Itis, we think, apparent that this definition, and this description of the purposes to which it is applicable by the court of
king's bench, as supervising the conduct of all inferior tribunals, extends to the case of a refusal by.an inferior .Qurt to
sign a bill of exceptions, when it is an act which "4appertains
to their office and duty," and which the court of king's bench
supposes "4to be consonant to right and justice." - Yet we
do not find-a case in which the writ has issued from that

court.

It has rarely issded froi any cou#; but there hre in-

sltances of' its being sued out of the court of chancery, and its
form is given in the register. It is a mandatory Wryit commanding the judge to seal it, if the fact alleged be truly stated:
"si ita est."
There is some difficulty' in ' ecouuiting for tneh
fact, that no
mandamus has ever issued from the court of klngl' be66eli, directing the justice of an inferior court to sign- a bill of, exceptions." Asthe court of chancery was the great officina hrevium
Of the kingdom, and the language of the statute of Westminster
the second *as understood as requiiing the king's writ to the
iustice, the- application to that court for tle writmight be supposed proper. In 1 Seh. and Lef. 75, the chancellor superseded a writ which had been, issued by the cursitor, on application; declarin& that it'could be granted only by order of-the
court. 'He appears, however, to have entertained no doubt of
his power to award the writ on motion. Although'the course
sdem4 to have ben to apply to the chancellor, it has.-never.
been determined that a mandamus to sign a bill'of exceptions
may' not be granted by the court of king'lsbench.
Itis said by counsel in argument in Bridgman vs.Holt, Show.
P. C. 122, that by the statute of Westminster the second, ch. 31,
in case the judge refuses, then a writ to command him, which is
to issue out of chancery, quod apponatsigillumsuurn. The
party grieved by denial, may have a writ upon the statute
commanding the same to be done, &c. "That the law is
thus, seems plain, though no precedent can be showh for such
a writ: it is only for this reason, because no judge did ever refuse to seal a bill of exceptions; and none was ever refused,
because none was ever tendered like this, so artificial and
groundless."

The judicial aet, sect. 13, enacts, that the supreme coUrt
shall have power to issue writs of prohibition to the district
courts when proceeding as courts of admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction; and writs of mandamus In cases warranted by
the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed, or
persons .holding offices under the authority, of the United
States. A mandamus'to-an officer is held to be'the exercise of
original jurisdiction; but a mandamus to an inferior court of
the United States, is in the nature of appellate- jurisdiction.

Vol[. V.- Z

SUPREME COURT.
[Ex parte Crane and another.]
A bill of exceptions is a mode of placing the law of the case
on a record, which is to be brought before this court by a writ
of error.
That a mandamus to sign a bill of exceptions is 4"warranted
by the principles and usages of law," is, we think, satisfactorily proved by the fact that it is given in England by statute;
for the writ given by the statute of Westminster the second, is so
in fact, anA is so termed in the books. The judicial act speaks
of usages of law generally, not merely of common law. In
England it is awarded by the chancellor; but -in the. United
States it is conferred expressly on this court, which exercises
both common law and chancery powers; is invested with appellate power; and exercises extensive control over all the
courts of the United States. We cannot perceive a reason
why the single case of a refusal by an inferior court to sign a
bill'of exceptions, and thus to place the law of the case on the
record, should be withdrawn from that general power to issue
writs of mandamus to inferior courts, which is conferred by
statute
In New York, where a statute exists similar to that of Westminster the second, an application was made to the supreme
court for a mandamus to an inferior court to amend a bill of exceptions according to the truth of the case. The court treated
the special writ given by the statute as a mandamus, and dedared.that it was so considered in England; and added, that
"though no instance appears of such a writ issuing out of the
king's bench, where an inferior court refused t6 seal a bill of
exceptions, there is no case denying to that court the power
to award the writ."' "It ought to be used where the law has
establishedno specific remedy, and where in justice and good
government there ought to be one.'
"There is no reason
-why the awarding of this particular writ does not fall within
the jurisdiction of this court, or why it should be exclusively
confined to the court of chancery."
In the opinion then of the very respectable court, which decided the motion made for a mandamus in Sikes vs. Ransom,
6 Johns. Rep. 279, the supreme court of New York possesses
the power to issu6 this writ, in virtue of its general superintendence of inferior tribunals. The judicial act confers the
power expressly on this court. No other tribunal exists by
which it can be exercised.

JANUARY TERM 1831
[Ex parte Crane and another.]

We proceed to the inquiry whether a proper case has been
made out, on which the writ ought to be issued.
The affidavit of Mr Bronson, the attorney for the defendants
in the circuit court, is the evidence on which the motion is to
be sustained. He says "-ihat the suits'were tried on a full
understanding, thateach party was to be considered as excepting to any decision or -opinion of the sa
court which he
might desire to review on a writ of erior,.whether such e3ception was formally announced at the trial or not;. and it was
also fully understood, in the event of verdicts for the plaintiff,
that the deponent would, after the trials, prepare bills of exception, and carry-the- eases by writs of error to the supreme
court of the United States." The charge of thejudge-was formally excepted to in one'of the cases, before the jury left the bar.
In the case of Nathaniel Crane, the counsel for each party submitted certain written points or questions of law for the decision of the court, which were decided: after which the presiding judge delivered a charge to the jury, in which he went at
large into the law and facts of the case.
In the case of Samuel Kelly, the- counsel for the defendant
submitted certain legal questions growing. out of the. facts of
th-e case, and requested the cdurt to decide them, before the
cause should be argued to thejury; to the end that he might'
know what questiofis Would be left to the jury. This was not
done, and the cause was argued; afterwhich the court delivered its opinion on the said questions of law, and then the presiding judge delivered acharge on the law and facts of the case.
That in each case the decision of the proposed points of law
consisted, as to most of the questions, in giving an affirmative
or negative answer to the propositions; but in the charge subsequenitly delivered in each case, the judge went at large into
the law of the cases, and commented upon it to an extent and
in a manner much more likely to impress the minds of the
jury, than in the brief answers previously given. That in the
judgment of the deponent, the remarks of the judge in his
charge, did in effect present the law of the case to thejiiry differently from what it had been given- to them, in answer to
some of the points submitted; and in such a manner that a full
and fair review of the judgments-of the circuit court cannot
be had without putting the charge In each case upon the re-

cord. He therefore, in each case, inserted the substance of
the charge in the bill of exceptions. That in the charge :the
remarks of the judge upon the law and facts of each case
were so blended, that the deponent did not, and does not believe it practicable to separate the renarks upon the law from
those upon the facts of tle 'ase, in such a manner as to give
the defendants a full and fair opportunity to review the judgments of the circuit court.
The bills of exceptions, which had been offered in December
to the presiding judge for his -signature, were returned. the
whole.of the charge in eaelf case being stricken out.
The subject was again brought before the judge, who returned'the folloiving answer to the application..
I.Dear.Sir:---I'have read the letteryou put into my hands
thin morning, which you had received, from Mr Bronson., in
relation to the bills of exceptions in the Astor causes. The
charge, as contained in the bills of exceptions, was stricken out
in conformity to what I understand to be the rule laid down
in the supreme court in the case of .Carver. It purports to set
out at length, the whole charge (how far this is correctly 'done,
I do not stop to, inquire); which I understand the supreme
court to say is a practice they decidedly,disapprove. There
can be no doubt that a-party is entitled to his exception, if he
sees fit to take one, upon every question of law stated to the
jury. .'I have not the bill of exceptions now before me, I am
net aware of any question of law arising, upon, the charge,
.which is not embraced within some one of the points specifically submitted to the court, and upon- which the court gave
an opinion: all which are e.ontained in the bill'of exceptiobs.
If this is not the case, and it is pointed out, it ought to be added to the bill of exceptions, and I will again look at it. But
the exception must be confined to some matter of law."
The counsel fo the defendants still insisted that the whole
scope and bearing of the charge, rather than any particular
expression in it, tended to lead the jury to a different result
from what they would have been likely- to attain from the
law,, as laid down in answer to the points made at the bar.
He designed to complain, that "though It may not in terms
have departed from the instructions given in answer to those
points, yet it did so in effect."2

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Ex parte Crane and another.]

The jurdge still refusing to sign the bill of exceptions -containing the whole charge, this motion is made.
The affidavit of Mr Lord, counsel for the plaifitiff in the
circuit court4 is also exhibited. He states the proceedings'at
the trial. The counsel for the defendants requested the opinion of the court on various propositions of law, "and the
court did then and there, in presence of the jury and of courisel, pronounce distinctly its opinion and decision upon every
such proposition;" after which the judge proceeded to charge
the'jury on 'the -evidence. After the conclusion of his remarks, in the case against Urane, 'some discussion arose betweeil the defendants' counsel and the court, in presence of the
iury, in which some passages of the charge appearihg not to
iIuve been rightly understood by the defendants', counsel, or
uot to have been'- learly stated;" the court again stated to'the
jury its charge on the points thus stated anew.
The bills of exceptions, prepared by the tounsel for the
defendants, were submitted to the deponent as counsel for the
:,laintif, who objected to the insertion of the charge, and stated
'ais reasons 1dr the bbje'tion. The counsel on.both iides atzended the judge, who said, " that he considered that which
in the biltl..of exceptions Is called the charge, and which purports to contain all the remarks of the judge on the evidence,
iproper to be inserted in the -bills of exceptionsj and not pr.
witted by law or the practice of thd court; that it was incumbent .on the party excepting, to specifythe matters of law
complained of, and that if any thing,could-be specified, which
wis-not expressed in the decisions aforesaid of the points spbmitted- (which decisions -are stated in the bills of exceptions),
It would allow the same-to be inserted in the bills of exceptions; but if that were not done, he shQuldallow the amendment of -the plaintiff, and the "statement called- the charge, to
he strufak out."
The jddga then'was willing to allow exceptions to his opinions.,on the questions of law which were made in the cause.
He-was also willing to sign exceptiofis to, any matter of law
advanced by him to the jury, which was not contained, in the
points reserved at the trial. The counsel for the defendants
insisted on spreading the Whole charge upon the record.

SUPREME COURT.
[Er parte Crane and aadther.J

.It appears to be customary in- New York, as in several
other states, for the judge; after the arguments are closed, to
sum bp the evidence at length to the jury, ana to state the
law applicable to faets; leaving it'to the jury, however, to decide what facts that evidence-proved. Such a charge must
necessarily consist chiefly of a compendium of the testimony.
To spread the charge upon the record, is to bring before the
appellate court the view taken by- the. judge of the testimony
given to the jury. If any law was mixed with this summary
of evidbnce, the right of either party to except is admitted.
The, question is whether an exception is allowable which
brings before the superior court so much of the charge as relates to evidence.
In-Carver's case, 4 Peters, 80, this-court said, "we take this
occasion to, express our decided disapprobation of the practice
(which -seems of late to 'have gained ground) of bringing the
charge of the court below, atlength,before this courtfor review.
It is an unauthorized practice, and extremely inconvenient both
to the.inferior and to the appellate court. With the. charge of
the court to the jury, upon mere matters of fact, and with its
commentaries upon the weight of evidence, this cour has
nothing to-do. Observations of that nature are understood to
be addressed to the jury, merely for their -consideration, as the
ultimate judges of matters of fact; and are entitled to nomore
weight or importance, than the juryiq,-the exercise of their
own judgment choose to give them. They neither are, nor
ave they understood to.be binding upon theit, as the true a4d
conclusive exposition of the evidence,. If indeed, in the summing up, the court should mistake the law, thatjustly furnishes
a. ground for an exception; but the exception should be stictly
confined to that mis-statement: and by being -made known at
the moment, would often etiable the court to correct- ai qrroneous expression, or to expl*in or- qualify, it in such a manner as to make it wholly unexceptionable, or perfectly dis,
tinct. We trast, therefore, that this court will hereafter be
spared the necessity of examining the general bearing of such
charges."
After such an expression of the opinion-of this- court, it
could not he-expected that a judge -on his cireuits would so

[Ex parte Crane and another.]

utterly disregard it, as to allow an exception to his whole
charge. If, however, the opinion.be unsupported by law, it
ought to be reconsidered and reversed.
At common law, a writ of error lay for error in law apparent on the record, but not for an error in law not apparent on the record. If a party alleged any matter. of law, at
the trial, and was overruled by the judge, he was without redress. the error not appearing on the record. 2 Inst. 42. To
remedy this evil the statute was passed, which gives the bill
of exceptions. It is to correct an error in law. Blackstone,
speaking of this subject, says; 9"and if either, in his directions
or decisions, he (the judge) mistakes the law by ignorance, inadvertence or design, the counsel on either side may require
him publicly to seal a bill of exceptions stating the, point
wherein he is supposed to err." "This bill of exceptions is
in the nature of an appeal." 2 Blackstone, 372.
It is also stated in the books, that a bill of exceptions ought
to be upon some point of law either in admitting or denying
evidence, or a challenge on somb matter of law arising upon a
fact not denied, in which either party is overruled by the
court. A bill of exceptions is not to draw the whole matter
into examination again; it is onl ? for a single point, and the
truth of it can never be doubted after -the bill is sealed. The
judges in Bridgman vs. Holt, speaking of evidence to be .left
to a jury, say; but no bill of exceptions ivill lie in such a case
by the statute when the "evidence is admitted and left to the
jury. *Show. P. C. 120. Bul. Nisi Prius,. 316.

If an exception may be taken in such form as to bring the
whole charge of the judge before the court, a charge in which
he not only states the results of law from the facts, but sums
up all the evidence, the exception will not be on a single
p9int; it.will not bring up some matter of law arising upon a
fact not denied: it will draw the whole matter into examinaiion again.
The affidavit in-support of the motion gives us the strongest reason for the course the mover has pursued, that the remarks Qf the judge upon the law and facts were so-blended,
that it was believed to be impracticable to separate the remarks
upon the law from those upon the facts of'fhe case, in such a

The difficulty, then, which appeared fo the cotinsel to be
insurmountable,-must be' overcome by this court. We must
peform, the impracticable task of -separating the rhmarks on

The inconvenience of -this practice, has been seriously felt
and has been seriously disapproved., We think it- irregular

.-Mr Justice BALDWIN dissenting.-:.The common lew definlition.of a mnandamus; which is adopted in this cottrt, is, "a

'court of judicature within the king's, dominion,, requiring
thenito do some particular thing-therein specified, *hich appertains to'their office or duty, and which the court of king's

consonant to right-and justice."

Marbury, v8; Madison, 1

Cranch, 168.
As-the first question which this motion presents is oie of
the jurisdiction and power of this court to grant the writ
prayed'forixi this casei it will be following the rule established
to c6nsidef it first (S Cranch, 172,. 1 Peters's Condensed
Reports, 169; 4 Cranch,221; 10Wheaton, 20; 1 Cranch, 91;
9 Wheaton, 816): a rule which never ought to be disregarded,
where'a question of power ariseS.
Though the questiorn of jurisdiction may not be raised by
cbtunsel,' it can never escape the attention of the court; for it
is one which goes to the foundation of their authority, to take
judicial, cdgnizanee of the case, if they cannot in the appropriate language of the law hear and determine it. The cause
is.coram -no judice, and every act done is a nullity. If I
take this case into judicial consideration, this is an assumption
of jurisdictinpthat necessarily results from a decision whether
this is or is not a proper case for a mandamws; for the cQurt
hear and determine the motion on its merits. Their refusal to
grant the -moion is not on the 'ground that they hive not
power to consider it, but that on consideration they reject it.

SANUARY TERM 1831.
[Ex parte Crane and another.]

This is as much an exercise ofjurisdiction as to issue, the writ;
as by examining the grounds of the motion the court assume the
power to decide on it, as the justice of the question may seem to
require. In my opinion, no new question of.jurisdiction ought
to be acted on without an inquiry into the power of this court to
grant the motion, 'or to issue the process. .The silent uncontested exercise of jurisdiction may induce the profession to
claim it as a right founded on precedent, though the judgment
of the court may never have been given on the question of
power, or their intention have been drawn to it by the counsel. If then process should issue improvidently, and the court
should find itself called upon for the first time to examine its
jurisdiction and power to issue it; when obedience should be
refused' by the court to which it was directed, and the question came before us.on this return: "the court is unanimously
of opinion that the appellate power of the supreme court of
the United States does not extend to this cburt under a sound
construction of the constitution of the United States: that the
writ of ma~zdamus in this case was improvidently issued under the authority of the twevtty-fifth section of the judiciary
act of 1789: that the proceedings thereon in the supreme
court were corarn non judice in relation to this court, and
that obedience to its mandate be declined by the court:"
this court would find itself in avery unenviable predicament, if,' on a careful revision of the constitution and laws,
they should be tompelled to sanction the open contempt of
their process or decree, by an inferior court, to whom an order had been sent from this high tribunal, which it found itself
forced to declare null and void. It is hard to say which would
be most fatal to its influence and authority, thp example or
the consequences.
The judicial history of this court presents one instance of
such a return on its records, and another ir which the military force of a state was in actual array in obedience to a law
for opposing the execution of a mandate; and a very recent
occurrence might have furnished a third incident, bad not a
writ of error abated by the death of the party suing it out.
The proceedings which have attended the assertion of the
unquestionable jurisdiction of the court over cases wiich,

ings, have been -olemfily decided, afford no uncertain indication of the results to be expected from the exercise o their
power without discussion or inquiry into its existence, and
over subjects on which it may, on exIamination, be found incapable of acting.
When questions of jurisdiction arise, they'must be settled
by a reference to tne constitution and acts of congress. All
cases embraced within the judicial power of the government
are capable of being acted upon by the courts of the union.
Those on which the original jurisdiction of this court can be
exercised are defined and cannot be enlarged. 6 Wheat. 395,
396, 399. Ithas no inherent authority to assume it over any
others, and congress are incapable of conferring it bylaw. 1
Cranch, 173. Where the constitution has declared the juris.
diction shall be original, congress cannot give it in its appellate
form, and vice versa. Marbury vs. Madis on, 1 Cranch, 174.
1 Peters's Condensed Reports, 267. 6 Wheaton 399. 9
Wheaton, 820, 821.

Though the coutts of the United States are capable of exercising the whole judicial power -as conferred by the constitution; and though congress are bound to provide by law for
its exercise in all cases to which that judicial power extends;
yet it has not been done, and much of it remains dormant for
the want of legislation to enabld the courts to exercise it, it
having been repeatedly and uniformly decided by this court,
that legislative pkovisions are indispensable to give effect to a
power, to bring into action the constitutional jurisdiction of the
supreme and inferior courts. 5 Cranch, 500, 2 Condensed
Reports, 588, 589. 1 Wheaton, 337. 6 Wheaton, 375,604.
9 Wheaton, 819, 820, 821. 12 Wheaton, 117, 118.
These principles remain unquestioned. They have long been
settled as the judicial exposition of the constitution on solemn
argument and the gravest consideration; and they are binding
on all courts and judges. I shall ever be found among the
last to oppose my opinion in opposition to the results of the
deliberate judgment of the highest judicial tribunal, when thus

on judicial interpretation, will change with the change of
judges. There may be exceptions to this rule.' When they
do occur, my hope is, that my reasons for a departure will be
found in the great principles of the government, which meet
with general assent in their adoption, thouglh the most able and
upright may differ in their application. But in any cases
*whichhave arisen or may arise, in which -the jurisdiction and
power of this court over the subject matter of the parties is
not questioned by counsel and deliberately considered by, the
judges, or should be unnoticed in .the opinion of the court, I
cannot acknowledge it as an authority affording a rule for my
decision, or a guide to my judgment. Such a dedision ought
neither to control my reason or settled conviction of pre-existing rules and principles.of law.
These remarks are deemed proper, as there are some cases
in which writs of mandamus have been issued under circumstances such as have been referred to, or refused on the merits;
but "the question of jurisdiction was not moved, and still remains open " accordifn to the rule laid down by this court in
Durousseau vs. The United States, 6 Cranch, 307, on a question
whether a writ of error could issue from the supreme court to
the district court of Orleans: and by the chiefjustiee, in alluding
to the case of The United States-vs. Sims, 1 Cranah, 252, "no
question was mide in that case as to the jurisdiction; it passed
sub .silentio,and the court does not consider itself as bound
by that case." 6 Cranch, 172,
These are the principles on which I shal examine the question of jurisdiction. The first inquiry then will be, has this
court by law the power to issue a mandamus to a circuit court
to sign a bill of exceptions, under the thirteenth and fourteenth sections of the judiciary act, which have been relied on
as authorizing it? So far as this act gives the power to issue a
mandamus to executive officers, they have solemnly declared
the law to be unconstitutional and void, and that the power
does not exist. It being considered by the court to be an exercise of original jurisdiction, it remains to inquire whether it
can be issue to any courts. appointed under the authority ofthe United States; and if so, in what casds.
T his power is defined in Marbury vs. Madison, I Crancb,
175, in these words: "9to enable this court, then, to issue a

SUPREME COURT.
[Ex parte Crane and another.]

mandamus, it must be shown to be an exercise of appellate
jurisdiction, or to be necessary to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. It is the essential criterion of'appellatejurisaiction,
that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already
instituted, and does not create that cause." In The United
States vs. Schooner Peggy, I Cranch, 110, we are furnished
with this-as the judicial definition: "it is in the general true
that the province -of an appellate court is only to inquire
whether a judgment when rendered is erroneous or not."
That case furnished an exception in these words: "but if subsequent to the judgment, and.before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and. positively changes the rule
which governs, the law must be obeyed or its obligation be
denied." In M'Cluney vs. SiUiman they lay down the same
rule: 'the question before an ippellate court is, was the
judgment corredt, not the ground on which the judgment professes to proceed." 6 Wheaton, 603. Appellate jurisdiction
being thus defined; its source can only befound iih the constitutioh which confers it, both' as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make,
(t'Lawi U. S. 68), and the judiciary act which makes these
exce ptions and regulations. 'The thirteenth section provides
that the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction friom
the-circuit courts, and the courts of the several states in the
cAses hereafter specially provided- for. These are defined in
the twenty-second section, as to the circuit courts, and in the
twenty-fifth section, as td the state courts. ,2Laws U. S. 64,65.
This court, from its first organization until this time, have
held that this enumeration of the cases in which it had appellate jurisdiction, was an exclusion of all others. 1 Cranch,
174, 175, . ;; 3 Cranch, 172; The United States vs. Moore,
6 Cranch 313, 314, 318; 7 Cranch, 32, 44, 287, 108, 110;

131, 132, 133, 203. The general principle the court have
acted .onis tlis: "that they imply a legislative exception from
its. appellate constitutional power in the legislative affirmative
description of these powers." 6 Cranch, 314. But if the appellatejurisdiction of this'court is described in general terms,
so as to comprehend the case, and there is no exception or
regulation whili..would exclude it from its general provisions

[Ex parte Crane and another.]

(as in Wilson vs. Mason, I Cranch, 91,'which was a writ of
error to the district court of Kentucky, on cross caveats, for
thp same tract cif land): or if it was the obvious intention of
the legislature to give the power, and congress have riot excepted it, as on the question which arose in the case'of Durousseau (6 Cranch, 3"12, 318), whether this court could issue
a writ of error to the district court of Orleans, they deelared
it "to be the intent of the legislature to place those courts precisely on the footing of the court of Kentucky in every respect, and to subject their judgments in the same mander to
the revision of the supreme court," and therefdre gave th6
lave of 1804 (page 809) a liberal "construction. Cohens vs .
Virginia, 6 Wheaton, 400, S.-P.
But where the law of 1803 authorized a writ of error from
the circuit to the district court, and dmitted to provide one
from this court to the circuit court, it was held not to be
within its appellate jurisdiction (The United States vs.'G-oodwin, 7 Cranch, X08 to 110), though the law giving this juriSdiction to the circuit court authorized appeals to the supreme
court from the circuit court from all final decrees and judg312ents rendered or to be rendered in any,'ircuit court, or, any
district court having circuit court jurisdiction, in any cases of
equity, or. admiralty, or maritime jurisdiction, prize, or no
prize, where the sum in controversy exceeds two thousand
dollars (3 Laws U. S. 561): and the twenty-second section of
the judiciary act authorized it on judgments of- the circuit
court in civil actions, in cases removed there by appealfrom
the district courts. This too was an action of debt, and the
sum in controversy fifteen thousand dollars; but it being on a
writ of er.or from the circuit -iirt, and not an appeal in the
words of the twenty-second section, this court gave it its literarconstruction, which had been settled in the case of Wischart
vs. Dauchy, cited by judge Washington in delivering the opinion of this court in Goodwin's case. "An appeal is a-civil
lav prodess, and removes the'cause intirely, both as to law
and fact, to-a review and new trial. A writ of error is a common lai;' process, and removes nothing for a re-examination but
the law." This statute observes. this distinction. 7 Cranch,
I10, 111 3 Dallis, 324, 1 Condensed Reports, 144.
Tliese seem to me to be the only two cases in which the

SUPREME COURT.
[Ex parte Crane and another.]

appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court can be exercised;
appeals and writs of error. This corresponds with the definition given by the court itself, as to its own powers, and the
strict construction which they have (with the two excepted
cases) given' to the twenty-second and twenty-fifth sections,
which are in their terms confined to final judgments and decrees of circuit and state courts, and these are the only cases,
where this court have ever exercised appellate jurisdiction.
They have uniformly refused where the judgment or decree
6 Wheat. 603. 12
was not final, (3 Wheat. 434, 601.
Whea t.- 136); and it cannot well be contended, that a refusal
of a circuit court. to sign a bill of exceptions is a final judg'ment or decree, or that it partakes in any degree of the character of either. -Thejurisdiction of circuit courts, over causes
removed from state courts is considered as appellate. But the
time,. the process, and the manner, must be subject th the absolute legislative control of congress. 12 Wheat. 349. The same
may be said of the jurisdiction of this court over causes senE
from th6 circuit court2 'n a 'certificate of division; but this is
by a special provision of'the law of 1802, 3 Laws U. S. 482,
which has been construed with the; 'same strictness as t"act
of 1789. 6 Wheat. 547. 10 Wheat. 20. 12 Wheat. 132.
6 Wheat. 363, 368.
The writ of mandamus contains no order to remiove a cuse
or any proceedings therein to the court issuing it, nor has it
that effect. The cause remains in the court below, whether
the writ be obeyed or not- the sole object being to.compel
them to act'on the matter themselves, not :to remove it for revision. That can only be done by writ of error or appeal.
These considerations make it evident that the issuing a mandamus is not only not an exercise of appellate jurisdiction,
but wholly different in its nature, object and effect.
It-was so considered in this court, in the case of MlIntire -vs.
Wood, 7.Cranch, 499, 000, 2 Cond. Rep, 588;- in which it wasdecided "4thatthe power of the circuit eourt to issue the writ of
mandamus is confined exclusively to those cases, in which
it may be necessaiy to the exercise of their jurisdiction," and
that cannot be the exercise of appellatejurisdiction; which in
this case, and in Marhury and Madison, the coiurt consider as
a case wholly distinct. A mandamus being a writ to com-

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Ex parte Crane and another.]

pel the performance of a ministerial act by a judicial officer,
is not, and cannot b6 a subject matter for the 'cognizance of an
appellate court, which acts only on the judicial acts, the judgments, and the decrees of inferior courts. In the United States
vs. Lawrence, 3 Dallas, 42,45,43, it was uninimously decided,
that this court could not issue a mandamus to a district
judge, acting in a judicial capacity; that they had no power to
compel a judge to decide according to any judgment but his
own. So in 1 6 ranch, 171, "1where the head of a department acts in a case in which executive discretion is to be exercised, in which he is the mere organ otfexecutive will, it is
again repeatedt that any application to control in any respebt
his conduct would be rejected without hesitation. In A'Cluny
vs. Silliman, it was determined that this court had not jurisdiction to issue this writ to the register of a land office, where
it had been refused by the highestcourt of.the state in Which
it was located; And in the same case in 6 Wheaton, 598,. it
was distinctly decided, that the power existed neither in the
circuit or supreme court; and all the prineiples herein stated
were reaffirmed and finally settled. If judicial authority is to
be respected, it.is useless to pursue this branch of the inquiry
any further.
I think then that.the issuing of a mandamus hy this, or a
circuit court, is not an exercise of hppellate jurisdiction.
There seems to be no judicial opinion in favour of the affirma.
tive of the proposition, and the cases referred to have been
decided iii the true construction of the thirteenth section of
the judiciary act, which declares, "that the supreme court shall
have appellate jurisdiction from the circuit courts of the several
states, in cases specially hereinafter provided for." This
is a distinct clause, and does not include the power to issue a
mandamus, as an act of appellate jurisdiction.
The next clause giving this power is, "and shall have power
t6 issue writs of prohibition to the district courts, when proceeding as courts of admiralty gad maritime jurisdiction, and writs
of mandamus in cases warranted by the principles and usages
of law to any courts appointed or persons holding office unaer the authority of the United States." This is an express
declaration of congress, that the power of this court to issue a
mandamus is not conferred as appellate jurisdiction in the

SUPREME COURT.
[Ex parterane and another.3

cases specially provided for in the subsequent part of the law,
but only in cases warranted by legal principles and usages,
not'referring to the constitution and laws of congress, but, a
will appebr hereafter, to theprinciples and usages of coprts of
common law. For it cannot be the'sound construction of this
section, that the power to issue a mandamus in a case not
mentioned in the" law, can be raise by implication in a ease
not within the express.power given in a subsequent clause of
the same section.
The issuing this writ not then being an act of appellate
jurisdiction, I now come to the examination of the second
branch of the proposition laid down by the court in Marbury
vs. Madison.
Is the issuing of this writ within the fourteenth section of
the judiciary act; which provides "1that all the before mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to inue
writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not
specially provided for by statutewhich maybe necessary for the
exercise of their respectivd jurisdictions, and agreeable to the
principles and usages of law." The words and evident meaning
of this law carry its construction on:its face. .It enumerates twQ
writs, but. does not mention'a-,-andamus. "Thereason is obvious; that had been provided for in the preceding, section:
congress could not have foreseen, in 1789, that any part of
their legislation on the subject of mandamus would have
been declared unconstitutional and void in-1803, and the decision in Jiarbury and Madison can have no bearing on the
fburteenth section. It must be construed as if the powers conferred in the preceding section had been constitutional, and
in full exercise by this court to the extent named in the law:
.that is to every court appointed, and to all persons lolding
office under the authority of the United States, in all cases
warranted by the usages and principles of law. 'This is certainly an express and plenary power, ample -to embrace a case
where the power Was necessary to.exercise the jurisdiction-of
this eourt. It took-away the necessity of a mandamus,under
the power given in the fourteenth section, and left it without
any application to such a case as the present, if the mandamus was warranted by the principles and usages of 1aw, and.
if it was not so warranted$ then it is excluded by this-section.

JANUARY TERM J831.
fEx parte Crace and anoth6r.]

BesiiIes, the thirteenth section gives the power expressly to
issue this writ by name; the fourteenth gives it only by implication. I do not feel at liberty to .rejecet a power expressly
delegated, and-seek for one by mere implication and constructiqn, taken from a subsequent part of the sme, law; withcut a
violation of the well settled principles of construing statutes
and the very words of this.- The authority to issue any'other
writsv thanfien fgcias and habeas corpus is confined to those
"not specially provided for by statute;"1 a mandamus 'was
provided for by the preceding section 6f the, same statute,
and therefore was not within this authority. The same rule
bf construction which this. court has applied to the thirteenth
must be carried to the fourteenth, section;, and the grant-of an
affirmative power in a specified ease or class of.cases excludes
all others, according to the-cases before cited.
Construing these-two sections then as if the power confer
red by-,both -were valid it is apparent that the fourteenth section could not have beery intended to embrace a mandamus to
a court. of the' United States: the very case. provided for by
that part of the thirteenth section, which -has never been de.
clared unconstitutional. It thbs-appears clearly tomy mind,
that the decisions of this iourt andrthe act of '1789 negative
both parts of the proposition, which ii laid down in I Cranch,
175, as necessary to make out a power in this -cortto ssue a
mandamus to a court of the United States. 'But, if the affirmative of this -proposition is admitted, the law requires some-thing more. The power does not arise unless in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law. Is this such a
case?
This court has repeatedly declared their sense of the meaning of these terms in acts of congress, organizing and confering powers upon the federal courts. They do* not apply to
the usages, principles and practice of the state courts, but to
those of common law, equity and admiralty jurisdiction of
England. There was an obvious reason for this: most of the
states had a local common law. The English common law
was a system which was intended to be applied to the exercise
of the ,judicial- power of the courts of the union, who were
vested with an appellate jurisdiction over the highest courts
of every statey and the necessity Js obvious of proceeding acVOL. V.-2 B

Wheat 222. Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 45. Fullerton
vs. Bank of the United States, 1 Peters, 613. Bank of the
United States vs. Ifalstead, 10 Wheat. 56.
The principles and usages of law, which warrant the issuing
of this writ, are clearly laid down in I Cran-eh, 168, 169:
" whenever there is a right to execute an office, perform a
'service, or exercise a franchise, more, especially if it be a
matter of public concern or attended with profit, and a person
is kept out of possession of such right, and has no other specific legal remedy, the court ought to assist by mandamus
upon reasons of public policy to preserve peace, order and
good government; this writ oughf to be used upon all occasions where the law has established no specific remedy, and
where in justice and good government there ought to be one."
These are the words of the court of king's bench adopted
by ,this. They further observe: "still to render the mandamus a proper remedy, the officer to whom it is to be directed must be one to whom such writ may be directed; and
the person applying for it must be without another specific
or legal remedy: .both must concur. 1 Cranch, 169.
It is a prerogative writ, Comyn's. Digest, tit. Mandamus
A, issuing from the court of king's bench, by virtue of its general and supervising powers, 3 Burr. 1265, 1267, on motion,
and for cause shown. This is a court- of special jurisdiction,
limited in the exercise of its powers to specified cases: it has
no prerogative powers and. can issue no prerogative writs: it
possesses no, general supervisory powers over inferior tribunals: and can in no ease grant a mandamus on its inherent
authority. 6 Wheaton, 600. Its implied powers are to fine
for a contempt, imprison for contumacy, enforce the observance of order. 7 Cranch, 34. -It may regulate process and
practice, but under'an -authority given by law. 10 Wheat.
22i 55, 64. This then is not a court which by the principles
and usages of the common law can issue a mandamus; not having ageneral superintending jurisdiction'like the king's bench;
but having no power to do it unless by express and delegated
authority. In New York the supreme court has claimed this.

power'on a mandamus to an inferior court to sign a bill of
exceptions; but the reason assigned is, "4we have the general
superintendence of all inferior courts, and are bound to enforce obedience to the statutes, and oblige subordinate courts
and magistrates to do those legal acts which it is their duty
to do. "The court admits,.however, that so late as 1810,
the application is entirely -new; that no-instance appears of
sucb a writ issuing out of the king's bench, when an inferior
coutt refused t9 seal a bill of exceptions; and if complaint
shQuld be made against this court or one of its judges, for refusing to seal a bill of exceptions, then the writ must, ex necessitate, come from chancery, if any where; but in no other
case can it be indispensable. Sikes vs. Ransom, 6 John. Rep.
279, 280. ,The writ founded on and reciting, the statute
of Westminster the second, 13 Edward I, ch. 31, is to be
found, in Ruffhead, 99, loo, commanding the judges to put
their seals to the exceptions, as is -prescribed by the statute
aforesaid,, and that on periculo quod incumbit nullatores.
The writ is set forth at large in the Registrum Brevium, 182
a, title Brevia de Statuto, ind was devised to enforce obedience to the statute,,made out bythe court of ehancery;. it is
issued on special application, founded on the right of the crown
to compel its -officers to pay obedience, to the statutes. It is a
sori of, prerogative writ, a mandatory writi The judges to
whom it is directed are supposed by the writ to have donewrong. They mayobey the, writ by sealing the exceptions;
or they may make a special return, which-ast be made to
the king in-chancery, and can be made no where else: and in
issuing the writ the court of chancery acts as' much judicially
as the court of hing'. bench does in grantinga mandamus.
If the judges make a false returni', an action may :be brought
against them. 1 Sch. and Lefr. 78, 79. Lord Redesdale

In the Rioters' case (1 Veinon, 175), a motion was made to
grant a mandatory writ to the chief justice of the king's bench,
and they produced a precedent where inlike cases such a writ
had issued out of chancery to the judge of the sheriff's court
of L.ondon; "but the lord keeper denied the tmotion, for that

could not presume but the chief justice of England .would do
what should bejust in the case: for possibly'you may tender a
bill of 'exceptions which has false allegations and the like, and
then he is not bound to sign it, for that might be to draw him
into a snare; and said if they'had wrong done them they might
right themselves by an action on the case."
In Bridgman vs. Holt, how. Par. Cases, 111, a writ of error
to the court of king's bench was pending in the house of
lords: an order was prayed foi to the. judges to seal a bill of
exceptions (which the Qourt had refused at the trial), to the
end that the said case might, as by law it ought, come entirely
before their lordships for judgment; &c. The house ordered
opies of this petition to be given to the judges, that they
should put in their answers in-writing. They, replied by protestation and saving their rights, declaring, "so that if th'e
pretended. bill was duly teuidered to these respondents, and
was such as they were bound to seal, these respondents are
answerable for it by the course of the common law in art action to be .rought on the statute of Westminster the second,
ch. 21, 'which ought to be tried by a jury of twelve honest
and lawful men of England, by the course of the common aw,
and not in any other manner:
"And the respondents further show, and humbly offer to
your lordships' consideration, that the petition is a complaint
in 'the nature of an original suit, charging these respondents
with a crime of a very high nature; in acting contrary to the
duty of their office, and so altogether improper, for your lordships' examination or consideration, not being any more triable
by your lordships than every information or action for breaeh
of any statute law is; all which matters are by the common
law, and justice of the land, of common right to be tried by a
jury.
"And the petition is wholly of a new nature, and without
any example or precedent, being' to compel judges, who are
by the law, of the land-to act according to their own judgments without any constraint or compulsion whatsoever, and
trenches upon all meqs' rights and'liberties, tending manifestly to destroy all trials by jury.
"And it is further manifest that this complaint is utterly
improper for your lordships' examination, for that your lord-

ships cannot apply the proper and only remedy which the law
hath given the party in this case, which is by awarding damages to the party injured (if any injury be done), for these are
only to be assessed by a jury. And they these respondents are
so far from apprehending they have done any wrong to the petitioners in this matter, that they humbly offer, with your
lordships' leave, to wave any privilege they have as assistants
to this honourable house, and appear gratis to any suit which
shall be brought against them in Westminster hall,.touching
the matter complained.of
"And they further, with all humility, offerto, your lordships' consideration, that as they are judges they are, under the
solemn obligation of an oath to do justice (without respect to
persons), and are to be supposed to have acted in this matter
with and under a due regard to- that sacred obligation; and
therefore to impose any thing contrarr upon them may enddnger the breaking of it, which they humbly believe your
lordships will be tender of.
"9And they further humbly show to your lordships, that
by a statute made in 25 Edward IIL ch. 4, it is enacted,
that from thenceforth none shall be taken by petition or suggestion to the king or his council, unless by indictment or
presentment of good and lawful people of the neighbourhood,
or by process by writ original, at common law; and that none
sha-ll be put out of his franchise or freehold, but by the course
of the common law. Andby another statute-in the twentyeighth of Edw. I11. ch. 4, it is expressly provided that no man
shall be put out of his lands or tenements, or imprisoned or
disiuherited, but by due process at law. .And by another statute, made in the forty-second Edw. III. clL 3 it is enacted,
that ;o man shall be put to answer without presentment before justices, or matters of' record on du'e-process and original

" And the respondents further say that inasmuch as the
petition'is a complaint in the nature of an original cause for a
supposed breach of an-act of.parliament, which breach (if any
be) is only examinable and triable by the course of the common law, and cannot ba in any other manner; and. is -in the

never to see the .judges of the highest court in a republic
afraid, when their judgment tells them that they stand on .the
written cbnstitution, and law of the nation; and their duty is
called into action on a proper occasion, to assert and maintain
those great principles of jurisprudence avowed in the highest
court in a monarchy, by judges of a subordinate one, under a
constitution unwritten, and which could give no control to a
legislative power, which was omnipotent. The'right of disobedience to a writ from a superior court to an inferior one, is
not alone to be found in.the courts of a foreign country.
That it may and ought to be exercised by a district court of
the United States, to a writ from the circuit court, whichthey
have no power to issue, has received the deliberate sanction
of this court. "The court deem it proper to take some notice of the mode of proceeding, for removing this case from
the district to the circuit court: it is believed to be noyel in
the practice of the court of the United States, and it certainly
wants the authority of law to sanction it. There.is no act of
congress which authorizes a circuit court to issue a compulsory
process to the district court, for the removal of a cause
from their jurisdiction, before a final judgment or decree is
pronounced. The district court therefore might, and ought
to have refused obedience to the writ of. certiorariissued in
this case by the circuit court; and either party might have
moved the court for a procedendo, after the transcript of,the
record was removed, into the circuit.court, or might h.ave pursued the cause in the district court, in like manner as if.the
record had not been removed."
Patterson vs. The United
Stetes, 2 Wheat. 225, 226: opinion of the court delivered by
Mr Justice. Washington.
The eircuit court have unquestioned appellate jurisdiction over the .district court. The fourteenth section of the
judiciary act authorizes :all the courts of the- United. States
to issue all other writs not spepiall provided for'by,statute,
which may be necessary forthe exercise of- their respective jurisdiction, agreeably, to the principles and usages -of
law. The writ of. certiorari is not specially provided for
by any statute; it is a common law writ issued by all superior appellate courts to ixLferior ones, and' by them to ma-

gistrates; it 'is the peculiar and 'appropriate process for orilring a record or proceeding to be certified to a superior tribuZil. 'But. being novel in practice, authoriied by no act of
congress, it ought to be-resisted, it was a:,nullity. The record though removed in fact *to the circuit, remained in the
district in law, and their pover to hear and determine it remained as full as before the writ *as obeyed. It is not necessary for me to inake adetailed application of t1hat case to this;
it applies to all cases where process is applied for to a court
which, has-no power to issue it. Ida new case therule laid
down by the chancellor in 1 Vern. 170, is a sound and safe
one: "but the lord .keeper told him that though he had the
custody of The great seal, yet he would make no use thereofi
but according to the course for the cburt."
Questions of jurisdiction and power. ought neither to be
sought -nor avoided; a great one has arisen in a very small
case, but such cases generally lead to the development of the
mighty principles which subvert and -found governments.
We are asked to issue a mandamus' to the circuit court of
New York, under circumstances which would-nQt justify one
to a county court. This part of the case was very properly
submitted without argument, and if the application could have
been rejected on- its merits, -without jurisdiction, to hear and
determine, " oyer and terminer," the merits, and to refuse or
issue the writ according to the justice and law of the case, I
should-have required no consideration: but as the existence.
of jurisdiction must precede its exercise, I have been forced
to tht investigation of this case, which, simple as it is on the
merits, necessarily involves principles which are the foundation and corner-stones of the judiciaF department of this government.
I am abundantly satisfied that the judicial power does not
extend to this case; that the~constitution and acts of congress
do not authorize a mandamus from this to a circuit court to
si'gn a bill of exceptions; that it is warranted b'y no principle
or usage of law, either the common law of this country or of
England; that the issuing of it is neither an exercise of appellate jurisdiction under the thirteenth, nor necessary to
the exercise of the jurisdiction of this court, within the
piovisions"of the fourteenth section of the judiciary act; thaf"

if the writ can be issued at 61, it is specially provided by statute, and can in no case issue from this court, as called for by
this motion, agreeably to the principles and usages of law.
This court have repeatedly decided, that this means the common law of England, as administered in her courts of lawand
equity. In tracing their qourse since the adoption of the statute of Westminster in 1285, I find, that the court of king's
bench, the only court in the kingdom which by virtue of its
high general prerogative and superintending jurisdiction can
issue the high prerogative writ of mandamus to any court of
record, 'has never issued one to sign a bill of exceptions: that
such a -writ is not an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, or necessary to it, but of original inherent power: that the power
to issue it.to the court of king's bench was solemnly denicd to
the highest appellate court in England: that the mandatory
and kind of prerogative writ, which has been devised and
founded on the statute of Westminster, as the only process
by which its provisions are enforced, issues from the king in
chancery, on application to the keeper of his conscience: and
that the high court of chancery has no appellate jurisdiction
over any court of record: that the writ when issued is not in
virtue of appellate jurisdiction in that court, or as necessary to
its exercise. These are the only cases in which, according to
the solemn opinion of this court in Marbury vs. Madison' it
cari issue the writ; thus adjudging and declaring that the-union
of the legislative and judicial.power of this government was
incompetent to authorize one to the secretary of state; in a case
appropriate for its exercise, and warranted by the principles
and usages of the common law, as defined by Blackstone and
Lord lansfield, and adopted by this court. In the absence of
a solitary precedent in England since the 13 Edw. I. or in this
court from its first organization, although- this statute forms a
part of the law of every state coart of record, and of the federal courts in civil cases, which come here for revision; I am
constrained to withhold.my assent to the exercise of any power
over the subject matter of this motion. It seems to me to be
as inconsistent with our own decisions, as with the principles
and usages of the common law.
There is another objection to the exercise of this power in
this case equally fatal. Two things must concur to authorise
VOL. V.--2 C

[Ex parte Crane and another.]

a mandamus. The officer to whom it is directed, must be
one to whom on legal principles such .writ can be issue-: and
'the person applying for it must be without any other specific
or legal remedy. The cases referred to clearly negative the
first requisite. It cannot be issued to a judge of the highest
court in the land; to a judge of an inferi6r court to perform-a
judicial act, or compel him to decide according to any judgment but his own; to an executive officer who may act or not
according to his own discretion, or is subject to the discretion
of another.
As the matter contained in the bill of exceptions forms a
part of the record, the supreme court must take ii as true. It.
admits of no contradiction by any proof. ' The signing of it by
the circuit turt is not a ministerial adt; but is in its nature judicial, relating to the admission or rejection of what is offered
in evidence, or mat(er of law, given in'-charge to the jury or
withheld by the court. An order from a superior 'to an inferior court to make that a parf of the record which they do not
feel it their duty to do, is in effect to compel them to decide.
by the judgmentof others, and not according to their own.
The next requisite which the supreme court say is necessary
is manifestly wantirig. There is, by the principles and usages
ci" the commhon law, a specific legal remedy provided for the
very case, by a special writ from chancery, returnable before the
king in, chancery, reciting the mandatory parts of the stattute
of Westminster. Though no act of congress authorises this
writ to issue fr-6m any court, there is a. specific and legal
remedy by an action in the statute for a f,'lse return, and a
special. actiob on the case, if the judges retuse to seal the bill
of exceptions when duly taken and tendered. This abundantly
appears by the writ in. the register, and the opinion of- lord
chancellor King,.in 1 Vernon; of lord Redesdale, in.1 Sch.
and Lefr.; of the co~urt of king's bench in Bridgman vs.
Halt; of justice Buller in his Nisi Prius, 316; and of the supreme court of New York, in 6, Johnson: and in the absence
of e'ven a dictum to the contrary. These opinions and cases
must be taken as clearly showing the law to be Well settled,
that these remedies are both specific and legal: the writ in the
Register is alone sufficient to show this. Lord Coke declares
original writs to be the foundation of 'the law. Preface to
8th Reports.

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Ex parte Crane and another.]

As the absence of such remedy forms a part of the definition of the only-cases in which, according to the doctrine
of the court of king'd bench, adopted in 1 Cranch, 168, 169.
'by this catirt, a mandamus can issue; the opinions of both"
coincide in declaring this not to be such a case.
It may be proper to notice sbme cases from which it may
be inferred that these principles have not been uniformly adhered- to. I The Lessee of Martha Bradstreet vs. Daniel
Thomas, 4 Peters, .102, an application was made to direct a
mandamus to the district judge of the northern districtof
New York, to sign a bill of exceptions: a nile to' show cause
was granted at the January term 1829, but discharged at the
next term on the merits. The question of jurisdiction was
not moved, and passed sub silentio;thus affbrding, in the language .of the court in 6 Cranch, 31-7, and of the chi'fjustice
in 3 Crafrch, 172, a sufficient answer to the supposed authority
of Mrs Bradstreet's case.
The same answer, applies to The United States vs. Peters,
5 Cranch, 115, 134, in Which a mandamus'was issued fo the
district judge of Pennsylvania, to order an atta.chment in the
celebrated case of Olmatead. No objection was! made to the
writ; and the cause was submitted without argument, for reasons apparent in the return of the judge, who had previously
rendered a-final sentence. The case of LivingSton vs. Dorge
nois) was a writ of error to the district court of Orleans. ' The
counsel for 'the appellant dismissed his writ of error without
the opinion of the court having been delivered. He then
prayed ai writ of mandamus nisiin the nature of aprocedendo,
which was granted without argument or question of jurisdiction. 7 Cranch,. 557, 589. The writ of procedendo to a
district court is within the words of the thirteenth section of
the judiciary act.
The decisions nf state courts, deriving their authority from
state constitutions or laws, are no test of the powers of the
courts of the United States; nor have their -usages or practice
ever been adopted by any act of congress or rule of the supreme cotirt, except so far as relates to the federal courts sitting within a state: but as much reliance has been placed on
the case in 6 Johnson, 278, 280, I think proper to observe
that the claim of the supreme court in that case was expressly

foufided on their general .controlling supervisory power over
all inferior courts and tribunals under the laws of New York,
placing them on the same footing as the court of king's bench
in England: a power not pretended ter exist in this.
If, however, this case is any authority, it is directly opposed to the power which we are now called on to exercise.
If, say that court, a complaint was made against them or one
of its judges, for refusing t 9 sign a bill of, exceptions, the
writ must, ex'neceessitate, come from chancery, if any where:
but in no other case can it be indispensable. If this assertion by that court of its power to issue this writ to any
inferior court, for such purpose and for such reasons as they
assign, is to be followed in this court as a safe guide to its
powers under the constitution and lpws of the Uniteal States;
then we may, as representing the court of king's bench in ifs
high prerogative character, issue a prerogative mandamus to
any district court; and- as representing the king in chancery,
and the chakicellor- as the keeper of his conscience and the
-great seal of the kingdom, issue the special mandatory sort of
writ prescribed by the statute of Westminster, Those who
feel themselves invested with such authority, as part, of the
judicial power of the government, must exercise it; but for
myself, I must disclaim it, as neither conferred by any act of
congress, or the principles and usages of the common law. I
do not f6el justified in' adopting them from any state court
acting under state-laws and usages; especially where that court
declares the assertion of the principle to be new, more than
thirty years after the federal courts were organized. Having
no authority under the twenty-fifth section to revise that opinion, I am not disposed, extra-judicially, to question its authority
in the state where it was pronounced: but believing it to be
contrary to the best establishefd rules and principles of the
conmon law, as well as to the uniform construction which this
court haq"given to the thirteenth and fourteenth sections of the
judiciary act,-in its general principles, I cannot adopt them.
Though no one respects more than myself the adjudication of
that courtyet I should be utterly wanting in that which is
due to the 'onstitution, the acts of congress; and the course of
this court for more than forty years, by making a state decision the standard of -our constitutional powers.

I have thus searched among the fountains, and consulted
the written oracles of the common law. The streams of justice which have flowed from the one have run in one unbroken current for five hundred and forty-six years, without such
a mandamus as this seen floating even on the surface. The responses from the other are the voice of the, law, speaking
through all ages, in one unvarying tone; delivering the results
of human wisdom, developed in principles, matured, digested,
explained, enforced and supported during five centuries,
amidst all the conflicts of party vengeance, civil war, and regal oppression.
But in reply to the question, has such a writ as this now
asked for, ever formed a pait of the principles or usages of
the common law of England, the response through all time.
has been the same: it is not the lineal descendant of the venerated mother of our best institutions. "1have drawn largely
on the adjudications of this high tribunal; and sought in the
principles established by the great men who have formed an
embryo system of American jurisprudence, that will not coweF
before any which has required centuries to build up in Europe. There too I find no writ issued, no power asserte~d, to.
command a circuit court to seal a bill of exceptions. Without
a rule to bind my faith, a decision to influence my judgment,
a reason to enlighten my understanding, and without one precedent to justify me in disobeying the settled convictions of
my conscience, I have a plain course to take, a plain line to
guide me in the path of duty. Believing that the law of the
land does not authorize this writ, that it is the exercise of a
power neither inherent nor conferred; I am compelled. to resist it: my judgment has been formed on the constitution and
laws of the union, the common law of England, of all the
states dnd the'nation, and cannot be surrendered to human authority. I am well aware of the weight of that against which
on several questions of jurisdiction, my duty has compelled
me to stand alone, and may again compel me: it is against
odds truly fearful, but to act against-my conscience and conviction -of duty would be more fearful still. Internal calm.
and peace of mind are too prdcious at my time of life to- be,

sit on cushions of down, while administering the supreme law
of the land in this court, their constitutional powers are not
-like those of the other departments of the government, though
the -case arises which brings them into existence, their exercise'
is discretionary. 6 Wheat. 404. But wth us, power and
duty to bring it into action are inseparable: whenever a case
calls for it, the call is imperative. Questions of jurisdiction are
important in all governments, but most powerful in this. 'They
must be approached with caution, arrd examined with delibera•tion; but cannot be avoided. When made by counsel or suggested by oueselves, we must examine them with the greatest
assiduity; when not aided by the researches, and enlightened
by the display and conflict of the talents and intelligence of
,ie bar, and without the responsibility of even an argument,
this court is called on to assert a power, which in the forty-two
years of its existence it has never exercised, that power growing out of a statute under which it hag never been exercised,
during the more than five centuries which have elapsed since
its enactment even in the country in which it was first adopted; to be exercised by a prerogative writwhich can be granted only by one high prerogative court in England, in which
the ring is presumed to be present, and the -proceedings to
be " coram dominiregisubicumquefuerimuw in dngtfaco;'"
which 'Pan issue the writ only by virtue of its great supervisory powers over all inferior courts, magistrates, officers and
corporations, to force obedience to the statutes, and compel
them to do those legal acts which it is their duty to do: I
must follow my own judgment, and' dissent in the threshold:
obsta principiis--8taredecisis.
The importance of the principles involved in this case, not
only as they1bear on the jurisdiction of this court in issuing
prerogative writs to the inferior courts of the United States,
but also on the appellate power conferred on them bv the constitution and the twenty-fifth section of 'the judiciary act over
the state courts, has made it a high duty to give this application a m6st deliberate examination. Compelled to dissentI
was bound to give my reasons, and cite the authority on
which my judgment was formed. Another reason is equally
imperious. Sitting here or elsewhere, it is my duty to exercise all the powers given by the constitution, which the legis-

[Er parte Cranb and another.]

lation of congress has authorized tht court to bring into action
on the cases which" may properly arise, and call for their aplication, and to enforce the judgments and decrees of either
tribunal of which I am a member, by all the process and physical means which the laws have placed at its command, and
on the failure of these to apply to the executive to see that
the laws are executed; I approach all questions of power and
jurisdiction with caution, and shall stop in the beginning unless satisfied that the constitution and laws empower and enjoin it as a duty to .proceed and finish what we can begin.
Fully satisfied that on the discreet exercise of the powers of
this court much of the strength and public usefulness of the
government depends, I have no fear that its judgments will
ever cease to command the support and confidence of the
country, while they are applied only to subjects clearly within the judicial power, according to the laws which regulate
,their exercise. But I do most seriously tpprehend consequences of the most alarming kind by the extension of its powers
by any analogy to the supreme prerogative jurisdiction of the
court of king's bench or a state court, aud its application to
process hitherto unknown in the history of the jurisprudence
of England or this court. Via trita, via tutd.
Mr Justice Johnson concurred, verbally, with Mr Justice
Baldwin in- the opinion, that the court had no authority to
grant the mandamus as prayed for: and he was of opinion that
the whole charge as delivered to the jury, by-the court, should
be stated ih a bill of exceptions; if fequired by the counsel who
took the exceptions.
Motion overruled, and mandamus prayed for refused.
