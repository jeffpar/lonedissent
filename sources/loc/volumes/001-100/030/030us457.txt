JOHN HAWKINS AND WILLIAM MAY, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR

vs. JosauA BA-EY's LEssEE, DEFENDANT IN ERROR.
The decision of this court, as to the validity'of the law of Kentucky, commobly
called the occupying claimants la*', does not affect the question of the validity
of the law of Kentucky, commonly called the seven years possession law.
The seventh article of the compact between Virginia and Kentucky, declares
" all private rights and interests of lands within the said district (Kentucky),
derived from the laws of Virginia, prior to such separation, shall remain valid
and secure under the laws of the proposed state, and shall be determined by the
laws now existing in this state (Virginia)." Whatever course of legislation
by Kentucky, which would be sanctioned by the principles and practice of
Virginia, should hie regarded as an unaffected compliance with the compact.
Such are all reasonable quieting statutes.
From as early a date as the year 1705, Virginia has never been without an act of
limitation. and no class of laws is more universally sanctioned by the practice
of nations, and the consent of mankind, than those laws which give peace and
confidence to the actual possessor and tiller of the soil. Such laws have frequently iiassed in review before this court; and occasions have occurred in
which they have been particularly noticed, as laws not to be impeached on the
ground of violating private rights.
Itis impossible to take any reasonable exception to the course of legislation pursued by Kentucky on this subject. She has in fact literally complied with the
compact in its most rigid construction. For she adopted the very statute of
Virginia in the first instance, and literally gave her citizens the full benefit of
twenty years, to prosecute their suits before she enacted the law now under
consideration. As to the exceptions and provisos and savingsin such statutes,
they must necessarily be left, in all cases, to the wisdom or discretion of the
legislative power.
It is not to be questioned, that laws limiting the time of bringing suits constitute a part of the lex fori of every country;-the laws for administering justice, one of the most sacred and important of sovereign rights and duties, and
a restriction upon which must materially affect both legislative and judicial
independence. It can scarce be supposdd that Kentucky would have. consented to accept a limited and crippled sovereignty: nor is it doing justice to
Virginia, to believe that she would have wished'to reduce Kentucky to a state
of vassalage. Yet it would be difficult, if the literal and rigid construction
necessary to exclude her from passing the limitation act were adopted, to assign her a position higher than that of a dependant on Virginia.
The limitation act of the state of Kentucky, commonly known by the epithet of
the seven years law, does not violate the compact between the state of
Virginia and the state of Kentucky.
Where a patent was issued for a large tract of land, and bysubsequent conveyances
the patentee sold small parts of the said land within the bounds of the original
survey; it has been decided by the courts of Kentucky, that the party of-

or excepted.

ERROR to the circuit court of Kentucky.
In the circuit court, the lessee of Joshua Barney brought
an ejectment for fifty thousand acres of land in -the state of
Kentucky, which he claimed under a patent from the commonwealth of Virginia, to Philip Barbour,-dated the 27th December 1786, and a deed from Barbour to-him dated the 7th
of August 1786. The defendants, William May and John
Hawkins; derived their title under a junior grant to William
May, for four thousand acres of land; and they proved on the
trial.in the circuit court, that John Crdemer who had conveyed
part of the land included in the grant to William May, settled
on the land in 1790, and that both of the defendants in the
ejectment have had possession of the land claimed by them
ever
Thesince.defendants introduced and read in evidence
a deed
from Joshua Barney to John Oliver, dated the 6th of January 1812, by which the 50,000' acres, conveyed to him
by Philip Barbour, were conveyed to John Oliver. The
deed contained a recital that he had previously sold and conveyed to John Berryman, 11,000 acres of the land, and
other small tracts to Charles Helm, in detached parcels.
The plaintiff then produced and read a d&ed in evidence, a
deed executed by John Oliver and himself, on the 6th January 1812, in which the former conveyances were recited, and
in which it appeared that the conveyance made -by him to
John Oliver on the 6th of January 1812, was to secure the
payment of twenty thousand dollars within three years, with
power to John Oliver to sell the land or any part of it, if Barney did not repay the sum which had been loaned to hini
by Oliver: he also produced 'in evidence a deed executed by
Robert Oliver; on the 21st October 1816, as the attorney in
fact of John Oliver, by which the title of John Oliver,- to the
whole of the land is released to Barney. This deed also
recites the previous conveyances to Berryman and others.
The power of attoney from John Oliver to Robert Oliver
was dated at'Baltimore on the 12th of October 1815, and was

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Hawkins et al. vs. Barney's Lessee.]

as follows: "And further I do hereby authorize and empower my said attorney to contract and agree for the sale, and
to dispose of as he may think fit, all or any of the messuages,
lands, and tenements, and hereditaments of and belongig to
me in any parts of the United States, or held by me in trust
or otherwise. And to sell, execute, and deliver, such deeds,
conveyances, bargains, and s&les, for the absolute sale and disposal thereof, or of any part thereof, with such clauses, covenants and agreements, to be therein contained, as my said attorney shall think fit and expedient. Or to lease and let such
lands and tenements for such periods and rents as may by him
be deemed proper, and to recover and receive the rents due
and to become due therefrom, and to give aquittals and discharges for the same, hereby meaning and intending to give
and grant unto my said, attorney my full power and whole au'V"thority
in all cases without exception or reservation, in whichf
it is or may become my duty to ac, whether as executor, administrator, trustee, agent, or otherwise."
It was In evidence that neither John Oliver or Joshua
Barney had ever been within the limits of the state of Kentucky, until within three mouths before the institution of the
ejectment, when Joshua Barney came into the state. It was
also proved that the debt due by Joshua Barney-to John Oliver
was still unpaid.
On the trial, the circuit court instructea the jury, that the
deed to John Oliver, and from Oliver to Barney, did not show
such an outstanding title as the defendants could allege; and
refused to instruct generally that the plaintiff had no right to
recover.
The court also refused to instruct the jury, that the plaintiff had no right to recover, unless he showed that the 11,000
acres did not cover the defendants, recited to have been conveyed to Berryman.
The court, also, refused to instruct the jury that the law was
for the defendants; if they found from the evidence that the defendants had had the land twenty years in possession before
the bringing of the suit.
The defendants excepted to the opinion of the court, and
prosecuted this writ of error.

SUPREME COURT
[Hawkins et al. vs. .Barney's Lessee.]

The case was argued by Mr Wickliffe for the plaintiffs in
error, and by Mr Jones for the defendant.
For the plaintiffs in error it was contended: that the defendant in error has not exhibited such a title in himself as
will entitle him to recover in this action, when taken in connexion with the proof introduced by the defendants below.
1. By the deed to John Oliver he divested.himself of the
legal title; and the deed by Robert Oliver, the agent, does not
reinvest hi~n with that title: the mortgage money not having
been paid, the conveyance was unauthorized by the letter of
attorney.
2. According to the recitals-in the deed of Barney.to Oliver
and from Oliver to Barney, Barney had conveyed distinetparcels of the 50,000 acres, to Berryman and Helm; and before
he was entitled to the verdict and judgment against the defendant, it was incumbent upon him to prove that Hawkins's
possession was not only within the boundary of the 50,000
acres, but that it was without the tracts conveyed to Helm and
Berryman.
The plaintiff was not entitled to recover, because the defendant proved an adverse possession, continued for more than
twenty years, before the commencement of this action; and
his absence from the commonwealth cannot avail himlbecause
of the provisions of-the act of the legislature of Kentucky of
1814.
If, however, the provisions of the last recited act are inoperative; that 'the plaintiff ought not to recover because of the
provisions of the act of the legislature of February 9th, 1809:
which law inhibits the recovery in this form of action, in a
suit commenced after the 1st of January 1816, when the defendant had resided upon. the land, claiming to hold under an
adverse title in law or equity, for seven years.before the commencement of the suit, or action at law.
Mr Wickliffe argued that Barney had not shown a right of
entry to the 50,000 acres, patented by the commonwealth of
Virginia to Philip Barbour,
That he'had not shown that he was entitled to that part of
the land in possession of the plaintiff in error.
The conveyance by Barney to John Oliver 'was absolute on.

[HaWkins et al.

its face, and recites the former conveyances of part of the laud;
but by the instrument which was executed at the same time, that
deed became a mortgage; the amount secured to be repaid in
three years. The title remained in Oliver. The reconveyance is said tb rave been made in 1816, by Robert Oliver, as
attorney in fact for John Oliver; but it is denied that the power
of attorney authorized that conveyance. The money which
was due to John Oliver was not paid before the reconveyance
by Robert Oliver, as his attorney; and was not therefore
within the scope and purpose of his powers. It was therefore a void deed. A mortgagor cannot maintain ejectment
after the time fixed for the payment of the money, unless he
can show that the same was paid. The legal estate is in the
mortgagee. 1 Marshall's Rep. 52.
The recitals in the deed from Barney to Oliver, show that
11,000 acres of the land had been conveyed to Berryman;
and Barney was bound to show that the defendants lived out
of the part so conveyed. 3 Marshall, 20. Madison vs Owen,
6 Littell, 281. 3 Littell, 334.
The case shows an adverse possessiodi in the plaihtiff's in error for twenty years; and adverse possession under a claim of
title. from the commonwealtl of Kentucky. for seven years.
The act of the legislature of Kentucky, which protects the
possession of the plaintiff in error, does rnot depend on the
same principle with theact of 1812, which has been declared
void, as to the provision for occupying claimants, by the court
in the case of Green vs. Biddle. No advocate for the rights
of the state of Virginia, under the compact, ever meant to
deny to the state of Kentucky the right to legislate over the
land within her teifitory; so as to quiet possessions, and prevent litigation, for the purpose of sustaining old and dormant
titles.
The seventh and, eighth article* of the compact between
Kentucky and Virginia have been supposed to be violated
by the limitation law. By that compact the rights relating
to lands were to be determined by ihe laws of Virginia.
The laws of Virginia established limitations of actions, amd
those of Kentucky are in the same spirit, and on the same
principles with the Virginia laws from 1750 or 1760; and the
same principles have been maintained and establiihed by the

SUPREME COURT.
[Hawkins et al. vs. Barey's tessee.]

laws of other states; they are to be found in the legislative
enactments of Pennsylvania, of Tennessee, of North Carolina,
of Massachusetts, and of other states.
The compact was only intended -to adopt and secure the
general principles of the Virginia land' laws, and cannot be
construed as a total inhibition to Kentucky to legislate in relation to the lands in the state. 1 Bibb's Rep. 22. Such has
been the uniform construction given to this compact. 1 Littell, 115. 3 Littell, 330.'
The. statutes of 1809 and 1813 are only-statutes of limitation, and do not"impair the obligation of any contract. Such
laws may by some be considered unjust; but they are pfospective, and affect remedies without operating on rights. 1

Mr Jones for the defendant in error.
The first objection is that the plaintiff below did not make
out a title. That he was a mortgagor, and could not maintain
the action after a forfeiture, without showing payment of the
money advanced by John Oliver. But the evidence shows
that Barney had ceased to be a mortgagor before the suit was
brought. A mortgagor may maintain a suit against a mortgagee. 19 Johns. 325. The mortgage is a mere security;
and a stranger cannot set up an outstanding mortgage.
But the power, of 'attorney was sufficient to authorize all
tha was done under it; and this was subsequently-tatified by
John Oliver. The power was full to the purposes of a release;
and if so extensive, its operation to that effect was all that was
,required.
Mr Jones denied that it was the duty of the plaintiff in the
-circuit court, to show that the land sold to Berriman was not
included in that for which this suit was brought. The authorities upon this point establish the principle, that the defendant
must show that fact.
He contended that the statutes of limitations violated the

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Hawkins et al. vs. Barney's Lessee.1

contract. The decisions of the state court, upon the vsadity
of the law, are not authority. The construction and meaning
of a statute of a state belongs to the tribunals of the state. But
questions, which go to the validity of the statute, are subject to
the supervision of this court; whether such a law be constitutional, is an inquiry here, by the express words of the judiaiary
act. The acts of Kentucky make a material distinction between residents and non-residents, excluding the latter entirely
from its operation. It requires actual possession by one claiming title, and the possession of a tenant is not sufficient. The
law of 1814 repeals the law of 1796, and does not affect the
savings in the Virginia statutes.
It is inquired whether the act of limitations is consistent
with the contract? As a general rule it has been said that statutes of limitation relate to the remedy. But this distincti6h
is not sound. There caii be ndo right without a remedy to secure it
It is not in the power of Kentucky, by any legislation, to
take away a right to land which was vested before the compact, except such as is warranted by the laws of Virginia.
He denied that any such warrant existed.
•Mr Justice JoHiNsox delivered the opinion of the Court;

Mr Justice BALDwiN dissenting..
This is a writ of error to a judgment of the circuit 'court of
Kentucky, brought to reverse the decision of that court on a
bill of exceptions.
The suit was ejectment, by-Barney, brought to -recover a
part of a tract of 50,000 acres of land, in possession of Mr
Hawkins, within the limits of his patent Both parties claimed under Virginia patents, of which Barney's was the eldest.
The plaintiff below proved a grant toBarbour, and a conveyance
from the patentee to himself. The defendant below proved
a grant to oie May, a conveyance from May to Creemer, and
from Creemer to himself. He then proved that Creemer entered
into possession under May, in 1796, and resided on the land
so conveyed to him, until he sold to defendant below; who
has had peaceable possession 'of the premises ever since, until
the present suit was brought, which was May 4th, 1817.

-

SUPREME COURT.
[Hawkins et al. -s. Barney's Lessee.]

This state of facts brings out the principal question in the
cause, which was on the constitutionality of the present limitation act of that state, commonly known by the epithet of the
seven years law. The court charged the jury in favour of
Barney, and -the verdict was rendered accordingly.
It is now argued that, by the seventh article of the compact with Virginia, Kentucky vas precluded from passing
such a law, And that this court has, in fact, established this
.principle, in their decision against the validity of the occupying claimant-laws.
I am instructed by the court to say that such is not their
idea of the bearing of that decision.
On a subject so often and so ably discussed in this court and
elsewhere, and on which the public mind has so long pondered, it would be an useless waste of time to amplify. A very
few remarks only will be bestowed upon it.
The article reads thus: "All private rights and interests of
lands within the said district, derived from the laws of Virginia prior to such separation, shall remain valid and secure
under the laws of the-proposed state, and shall be determined
by the laws now existing in this state."
Taken in its literal sensei it is not very easy to ascribe to
this article any more than a confirmation of present existing
rights and interests, as derived under the laws of Virginia.
And this, in ordinary cases of transfer of jurisdiction, is exactly what would have taken place upon a k nown principle of
international and political law, without the protection of such
an article. We have an analogous case in the thirty-fourth
section of the Judiciary Act of the United States; in which it
is enacted that the laws of the several states shall be rules of
decision in the courts of the United States; and which has
been uniformly held to be no more than a declaration of what
the law would have been without it: to wit, that the lex loci
must be the governing rule of private right, under whatever
jurisdiction private right comes to be examined.
And yet, when considered in relation to the actual subject
to which this article was to be applied, and the peculiar phraseology of it; there will be found no little reason for inquiring
whether it does not mean something more than would be

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Hawkins et al. vs. Barney's Lessee.]

implied without it; or, why it was introduced if not intended to
mean something more. It had an almost anomalous subject
to operate upon.
I perceive that in the copy of Littell's laws, which has been
sent to our chambers, some one has had the perseverance to
go over the legislation of Virginia, relating, to the lands of
Kentucky whilst under her jurisdiction, and to mark the various senses to which the word rights has been applied, in the
course of her legislation. It is curious to observe how numerous they are. Her land system was altogether peculiar, and
presented so many aspects in which it was necessary to consider it, in order to afford protection to the interests inparted
by it, that it might, with much' apparent reason, have been
supposed to require something more than the general principle
to secure those interests. So much remained yet to be done
to impart to individuals the actual fruition of the sales or
bounties of that state, that there must have been, unavoidably,
left a wide range for the legislative and judicial action of the
newly created commonwealth. When about then to surrender the care and preservation of rights and interests, so novel
and so complex, into other hands; it was not unreasonably
supposed by many, that the provisions of the compact of separation were intended to embrace somethiiyg beyond the general assertion of the principles of international law, in behalf of
the persons whose rights were implicated in, or jeoparded by
the transfei'.
Such appears to have been. the view in which the majority of this court regarded the subject in the ease of Green
vs. Biddle; when upon examining the practical operation of the occupying claimant laws of Kentucky, upon -the
rights of land-holders; they were thought to be like a disease
planted in the vitals of men's estate, and a disease against
which no human prudence could have guarded them, or at least
no practical prudence, considering the state of the country, and
the nature of their interests. And when again. upon looking
through the course of legislation in Virginia, there Was found
no principle or precedent to support such laws, the court was
induced to pass upon them as laws .calculated in -effect to annihilate the rights secured by the compact, while they avoided
an avowed collision with its literil meaning. But in all their
VOL. V.-3 I

SUPREME COURT.
[Hawkins et a]. vs. Barney's Lessee.]

reasoning on the subject, they will be found to acknowledge,
that whatever course of legislation could be sanctioned by the
principles and practice of Virginia, would be regarded as an
unaffected compliance with the compact.
Such, we conceive, are all' reasonable quieting statutes.
From as early a date as the year 1705, Virginia has never been
without an act of limitation. And no class of laws is more
universally sanctioned by the practice of nations, and the consent of mankind, than laws which.give peace and confidence
to the actual possessor and tiller of the soil. Such laws have
frequently passed in review before this court; and occasions
have occurredl in which they have been particularly noticed
as laws not to be impeached on the ground of violating private
right. What right has any one to complain, when a.reasonable time has been given him, if he has not been vigilant in
asserting his rights ? All the reasonable purposes of justice
are subserved, if the courts of a state have been left open to
the prosecution of Au'its for such a time as may reasonably
raise a presumption in the ocaupyer of the soil that the fruits
of his labour aire effectually secured beyond the chance of
litigation. Interest reipublime ut. finis sit litium;-and
vigilantibs non dormientibus succurritI&T; are not among
the least favoured of the maxims of the law.
It is impossible to take any reagonable exception to the course
of legislation pursued by Kentucky on this subject: She.has
in fact literally complied with the compact. in its most rigid
construction: for she adopted the very statute of Virginia
in the first instance, and literally gave to her citizens the full
benefit of twenty years to prosecute their suits, before she
enacted the law now under consideration. As to the exceptions and provisos and savings in such" statutes, they must
necessarily be left in all cases to the wisdom or discretion of
the legislative power.
It is not to be questioned, that laws limiting the time of
bringing suit, constitute a part of the lex fori of every country: they are laws for administering justice; one ofthe most sacred
and important of sovereign rights and duties: and a restriction whith must materially affect both legislative %nd judi
cial independence. It can scarcely be supposed tlat Kentucky
would have consented to accept a limited and crippled sovereignty: nor is it doing justice to Virginia to believe that she

JANUARY TERM 1831
[Hawkins et a!. vs. Bamey's Lessee.]

would have wished to reduce Kentucky to a state of vassalage.
Yet It would be diflict.lt, if theliteral and rigid construction
necessary to exclude her from passing this law were to be
adopted; it would be difficult, I say, to assign her a position
higher than that of a dependant on Virginia. Let the language of the compact be literally applibd, and we have the
anomaly presented of a sdvereign state governed by tfie laws
of another sovereign; of one half the territory of a sovereign
state' hopelessly and forever subjected to the laws of another
state. Or a motley multiform administration of laws, under
which A. would be subject to one class of laws,.because holding under a Virginia grant; while B., his next door neighbour,
claiming from Kentucky, would hardly be conscious of living
under the same government.
If the seventh aiticle of the compact can be constr.ed so as
to make the limitation act of Virginia perpetual and unrepealable in Kentucky; then I know not on what principle the same
rule can be precluded from applying to laws of descent, conveyance, devise, dower, courtesy, and in fact every law applicable to real estate.
-It is argued, that limitation laws, although belonging to the
lex fori, and applying immediately to the remedy, yet indirectly they effect a complete divesture and even transfer of

right. This is unquestionably true, and yet in no wise fatal
to the validity of this law. The right to appropriate a derelict is one of universal law, well~known to the civil law, the
common law, and to all law: it existed in a state of nature,
and is only modified by society, according to the discretion of
each community. What is the evidence of an individual
having abandoned his rights or property? It is clear that the
subject is one over whiph every community is at liberty to
make a rale for itself; and if the state of Kentucky has established the rule of seven years negligence to, pursue a remedy,
there can be but-one question made upon the right to do so:
which is, whether, after abstaining from the exercise of this
right for twenty'y ears, it is possible now to impute to her tho
want of good faith in the execution of this compact.
Virginia has always exercised an analogous right, not only
in the form of an act of limitation, but in requiring actual
seating and cultivailon.
In the early settlement of the country, the man who re-

SUPREME COURT.
[Hawkins et al. v$. Barney's Lessee.]

ceived a grant of land and failed, at first in three, and afterwards in five years, to seat and improve it, was held to
have abandoned it: it received the denomination of lapsed
land, was declared to be forfeiled (Mercer's Abr.); and any
one might take out a grant for it. The last member of the
eighth article of this compact, distinctly recognises.the existence of the powez in Kentucky to pass similar laws; notwithstanding the restrictions of the seventh article, and also the
probability of her resorting to the policy of such laws. It
restricts her from passing them for six years: and what is
remarkable, the protection of this restriction is expressly confined to the citizens of the two states; leaving the plaintiff
below, and all others, not citizens of Virginia, to an uncontrolled exercise of such a power. Forfeiture is the word'
used in the old laws, and forfeiture is that used in the compact, and the term is correctly applied; since it supposes a revesting in the commonwealth: and it is remarkable how scrupulously Kentucky has adhered to the Virginian principle in
her seven years law, since the benefit of it is confined to such
.only as claim under a grant from the commonwealth; thus
literally applying the Virginian principle, bf a revesting in the
commonwealth and a regranting to the individual.
Upon ihe whole, we are unanimously of opinion that the
court below charged the jury incorrectly on this point; and if
it stood alone in the cause, the judgment would be reversed.
But as it must go back, there are two other points raised in
the bill of exceptions which it.is necessary to consider here.
, The one is upon the sufficiency of the power of attorney
executed by John to Robert Oliver, and under which the latter
executed a deed to Barney to revest in him the fee simple of
the land. Upon looking into that instrument, we are satisfied
that although not professional in its style and form, it contains
sufficient words to support the deed; and there was no error
in the decision of the court as to this point.
The other question is one of more difficulty. Upon the
face of the deed from Barney to Oliver, and the reconveyance
from Oliver to Barney, there are recited several conveyances
of parcels of the tract granted to Barbour, to several individuals,
and particularly to one of 11,000 acres to one Berriman. The
case on which the instruction was prayed makes out that Barney proved Hawkins to have trespassed within the limits of

JANUARY TERM 1831.
[Hawkins et al. vs. Barney's Lessee.]

the 50,000 acres; but it was insisted that he ought also to have
proved the trespass to be without the limits of the tract shown
to have been conveyed away by himself. On the other side
it was insisted that, the onus lay on Hawkins, to prove that his
trespass was within the limits of one of those tracts,,and the
court charged in favour of Barney.
This we conceive to be no longer an*open question; it has
been solemnly decided in a series of cases in Kentucky, that
the party, offering in evidence a conveyance containing such
exceptions is bound to show that the trespass proved is without the limits of the land so sold or excepted. 3 Marshall, 20.
6 Littell, 281. 1 Monroe, 142.
The only doubt in this case was as to which of the two parties this rule applies, since both,'and Hawkins first in order,
produced in evidence a deed containing the exceptions. But,
whether by the exceptions or by the deed, Hawkins's purpose
was answered if he proved' the whole land out of Barney.
Not so with_ Barney; for in the act of proving the reinvestment of the estate in himself, he proved it to be with the exceptions mentioned, and therefore the rule unquestionably applied to him.
From these observations it results, that the court below erred
in refusing to instruct the jury according to the prayer of
Hawkins; to wit, "cthat if they believed the eviaence, the
plaintiff, Barney, had no right of entry when this suit was instituted, and that unless he showed that the 11,000 acres recited to be conveyed to Berriman by Barney did not cover
the land in question, he was not entitled to recover in that
suit."
The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for a
venire facias de novo.
