this court. This is so obviously an interlocutory decree, that
we do not think it necessary to examine it in detail, to show
that a further and final decree is necessary, to give to the com'plainant any of the advantages to which the court in its
previous directions has declared him to be entitled.
For th ieasons given in the opinion in the case of Roswell
Beebe et al., appellants, v. William Russell, we therefore
direct this cause to be dismissed for want ofjurisdiction.

ARCHIBALD BABCOCK, APPELLAwT, v. EDWARD WYMi.
Paol evidence is admissible to show that a conveyance of property, absolute upon
the face of it, was really a mortgage or deed of trust.
In the present case, parol evidence, taken in conjunction with corroborating
circumstances, shows that the deed was not intended to be absolute.
The statute of limitations is not applicable, because the possession was not adverse.
So, also, the trustee is not protected by the statute, although he sold the land
and received the proceeds six years before the bill was filed, because it was his
duty to apply those proceeds to the reduction of the interest and principal of the
debt due to him when the deed was made.

TmS CAUSE.]

Tas was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the.United
States for the district of Massachusetts, sitting in equity.
The bill was filed by Edward Wyman, a citizen of Missouri,
and an assignee of Nehemiah Wyman, by a deed of conveyance made in 1853. The facts of the case are particularly
stated in the opinion of the court, and need not be repeated.
The decree of the Circuit Court was as follows, viz:
This case havinig been heard on the.bill of complaint filed
therein, and upon the answer'of the defendants thereto, and
upon the proof exhibited by the respective parties, and the
arties having been heard by their counsel, this court doth
eclare the conveyance of Nehemiah Wyman to said defendan4.
bearing date the twentieth day of November,. in the year one
thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, to have been a
mortgage to secure the debts, the amount whereof is named
in said deed, as the consideration of the same; and that, at
the times of the sales of the lands in said conveyance set fortl
by the defendant, the assignor of the complainant had the
-right to redeem the same; and doth declare that the absolute
sales and conveyances by defendant of said land to bona fide
â€¢purchasers for valuable consideration, without notice, was a
constructive fraud upon the rights 9f the assignor of complainant; and that therefore he became entitled, as against the

defendant personally, to an account of the value of the land
and of the rents and profits thereof, and, after deducting the
amount of principal and interest due said defendant, to the
payment of the balance; and doth decare that the complainant, as assignee, has succeeded to those rights.
And said cause having been referred to a master, to take the
necessary accounts, in pursuance of the foregoing declaration
of this court, and said master having made his report in the
premises, and the same being duly considered and the respective parties heard therein, this court doth order and decree that
there be paid by said defendant to said complainant the sum
of twelve thousand and sixty-seven dollars and nine cents,
together with costs taxed at four hundred and sixty-nine
dollars and seventy-four cents.
Babcock appealed to this court.
The case was argued by lXr. Loring and Mir. Xlferwin for the
appellant, and by Mkr. Bartlett for the appellee.
The reporter can notice only that part of the arguments of
counsel which related to the admissibility of parol evidence in
this case, to establish that the deed, absolute in its terms, was
intended to operate only as a mortgage.
The counsel for the appellant treated this point in the
following manner:
I. The first question is, whether, under the circumstances
-of this case, it is competent to show, by parol evidence, that a
deed absolute in terms'was intended to operate only as a mortgage. The respondent contends that it is not competent, but
is in direct violation of the statute of frauds.
The well-settled rule in equity is, that it is not competent
to show by parol evidence that an absolute deed was intended
only as a mortgage, except upon the ground that the written
defeasance was omitted by fraud, accident, or mistake. (1
Story Eq. Jur., sees. 153, 154, 155, 156; 4 Kent's Com., 142.)
It is clear, upon the facts, that a written defeasance was not
omitted through any accident, mistake ignorance, or fraud.
On the contrary, the parties executed all the papers they
intended to, and the form of the conveyance was precisely
what they intended it should be. (Hunt v. Rousmanier's
Ex'rs, 1 Peters, 1.)
According to the testimony of both 1ehemiah and William
Wyman, the present conveyance was in exchange for the
mortgages which the said Nehemiah had previously given to
the respondent and Francis Wyman, the parties well knowing

DECEMBER TERM, 1856.

291

Babcock v. Wyrman.

the distinction between the- two forms of conveyance, and
their different legal effect.
It is a1so certain, upon their evidence, that no defeasance
was contemplated, and that it was not omitted through any
any misapprehension, by
through
of the
respondent,
fraud
of theornature
or effect of is deed.
lTehemiah
Wyman,
The proposition, therefore, which the complainant must
maintain in this case is, that it is competent, by parol evidence
of the admissions of the grantee at the time the conveyance
was made, to convert an absolute deed into a mortgage,
although the grantor, well knowing their different legal effect,
deliberately, and in defiance of the statute, gave an absolute
conveyance.
Such a proposition is not warranted.by the decisions, and is
entirely subversive of the statute of frauds.
The fraud against which equity relieves, is not the refusal
of one of the parties to acknowledge or perform a void parol
contract, the parties having voluntarily assumed the risk of
the statute-but it relieves where the parties did intend to'put
their contract int6 writing, conformably to the statute, and
have failed to -do so, through the fraud of one, or by.mutual
mistake.
"Where there is no fraud, and the part relies upon ihe
honor, word, or promise, 6f the defendant, th9 statute making
that promise void, equity *ill not interfere." (Lord Hard.
wicke, in Montacute v. Maxwell, 1 P. Wms., 118.)
To extend the doctrine beyond this, and to allow a party to
offer parol evidence of an agreement, on the ground that the
mere refusal to acknowledge or perform that agreement
(which the statute itself declares- is void) is such a fraud as
will avoid the statute, and render the parol evidence competent, amounts to a judicial repeal of the statute.
.lUpon this ground, there can be no case to which the statute
of frauds can possibly apply.
The fallacy of this theory is, that it admits the evidence
prohibited by the statute, for the purpose of first proving a
fraud by proving a refusal to perform a parol agreement, and
then uses that fraud as- the reason for admitting the parol
evidence to prove the agreement.
To allow, then, the complainant, under the circumstances
of the case, to control the legal effect of the conveyance of
Nfehemiah Wyman to the respondent, byparol evidence of his
declarations or admissions made at the time the deed was
executed, would violate the statute of frauds, and would also
be contrary to the decided woight of authority.
In England, it has been uniformly held that parol evidence

292

SUPREME COURT.
Babcock v. Wym.

was inadmissible, except to show that the defeasance was
omitted through -fraud, accident, or mistake. (Walker v.
Walker, 2 Atk., 99; Young v. Peachy, 2 Atk., 257; Jones v.
Statham, 3 Atk., 389.)
And the great preponderance of authority in this country is
to the same same effect. (4 Kent's Com., 142; 2 Story Eq.,
sec. 1,018; Marks v. Pel], 1 John. Ch. R., 594; Stevens v.
Cooper, 1 John. Ch. R., 429. Strong v. Mitchell 4 Johns.
Ch. R., 167, and James v. Johnson, 6 Johns. Ch. R., 417, are
not to the contrary. Rathbun v. Rathbun, 6 Barb., 98; Webb
v. Rice, 6 Hill, 219; Lyod v. Ex'rs Iglis, 1 Des., 337; Fitzpatrick v. Smith, 1 Des.,- 340; Bond v.- Susquehannah Co., 6
Har. and J., 128; Watkins v. Stocket% Adm'r, 6 Har. and J.,
435; Merrills v. Washburn, 1 Day, 139; Brainerd v. Brainerd,
15 Conn., 586.)
t
In Massachusetts, the decisions are very pointed. (Waler
v. Locke et al., 5 Cush., 90; Peabody v. Tarbell, 2 Cush.,
226, 232.)
The decision of Judge Story, in Taylor v. Luther, 2 Sumn.,
228, is inconsistent with the doctrine stated by him in 2 Story
Eq., sec. 1,018.
And in 3 Story, 203, he said, "In Taylor v. Luther, I had
occasion to carry the doctrine one step further."
1o decision of this court authorizes the doctrine which the
complainant must maintain in this case.
Conway's Ex'rs v. Alexander (7 Cranch, 238) simply decided that the court in construing an instrument, may read it in
the light of the extrinsic circumstances.
Morris v. Nixon et al. (1 How., 118, 133) was decided on
the ground that the letter of Nixon to the complainant, either
showed that the transaction was intended as a mortgage, or
that Nixon had a design to mislead the complainant into that
belief.
I Russell v. Southard et al.; (12 How. U. S., 139,),a written
memorandum was given by the grantee, and the question was,
whether the transaction was a mortgage or conditional sale.
According either to the understanding' of this respondent,
the ground of that decision was, that thd parties did intend a
mortgage in due form, and that, through mistake or the fraud
of Southard, the memorandum failed to be so expressed; or
else, that if the transaction, as really understood by the complainant at the time, was a conditional sale, yet that the bargain was so unconscionable, and took such advantage of the
complainant's necessities, that it amounted in equity to a fraud.
Otherwise, if the memorandum did show a conditional sale, if
the complainant so understood it, and the bargain was a fair

one, it would be difficult to conceive upon' what ground it
could be set aside, and held to be a mortgage only.
Mr. .Bartlett, for the appellee, referred to the point as follows:
Upon the question, whether oral evidence is admissible to
show that a deed, absolute on its faee, was-id fact given as security for a debt, and is-a mortgage, appellee forbears to trouble
the court with any authorities beside those referred to in the
opinion of the Circuit Court, which seem conclusive, and are
as follows: Taylor v. ,Luther, 2 Sumner, 229; Jenldns v.
Eldridge, 8 Story, 293; Conway v. Alexander, 7 Crandh, 238;
Sprigg v. Bank of Mt. Pleasant, 14 Peters, 201; Morris v.
Nlixon, I Howard, 126; Russell v. Southard, 12 Hov'ard, 139.
Mr. Justice McLEANf delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court for
Massachusetts.
The bill states the following facts: Nfehemiah Wyman wag
seized in fee of about eleven and a half acres of land in Charleston, purchased bly him of Tuft's administrator, one acre of
which he sold to Foster, who gave A mortgage to secure the
payment of the consideration of $600, which sum was not paid
when due, and he entered to foreclose. The entire tract on
the 1st of December, 1820, had been mortgaged by him to
Francis Wyman, his brother, to secure three notes of that
date, one for $676, payable in one month; another for $6&0,
payable in six months; the third for $704.39, payable in one
year; interest to be paid on each note semi-annually.
Shortly after this, Francis Wyman, by his will, dated 14th
June, 1822, devised to defendant, Babcock, all his estate, including said notes and mortgage, in trust for testator's wife
and children, and made Babcock his executor. The testator
died in August, 1822. On the 1st of December, 1824, Nfehemiah paid Babcock, as trustee-and executor, the note for $704
and interest; and from time to time paid the interest on the
other notes, up to December, 1826.
In 1825 or 1826, Nqehemiah became embarrassed, and having entire confidence in his brother-in-law, Babcock, he, by
deed, 26th April, 1826, mortgaged the eleven acres of land as
security of a note to Babcock of that date, for $1,200, payable
in one year, with interest. At this time, little, if anything, was
due to Babcock, but it was understood, between them, that
Babcock would become security for him, or advance money to
him, the mortgage to stand as a security. Before the 20th of
November, 1828, Babcock did become bound for and advanced

294

SUPREME COURT.
.Babcock v. Wyman.

to him-upwards of $400. In addition to this, there was due
to Babcock as executor, for rent, $136.71. On a settlement,
Nehemiah executed to Babcock three notes, one dated 7th November, 1828, for $486.79, of which $400.08 were due Babcock individually, and $86.71 to the heirs of Nehemiah Wyman,. sen.; another note for $8.10, and third for $50, due to the
heirs of the same, were given.
Nehemiah being thus indebted to Babcock, as trustee and
executor, and liotbeing able to pay the interest, Babcock and
William Wyman, brother of Nehemiah, urged him to make a
clear deed in fee 4for the land aforesaid, to Babcock, that he
might
manage an improve the same, and apply the rents and
profits to pay interest on the ehcumbrances, and to the gradual
liquidation of the principal. And finding that this conveyance to Babcock was made a condition of further advances, he
eventually conveyed the estate to Babcock, it being expressly
agreed by Babcock, that, notwithstanding the foirm of the conveyance, it should stand as security only for the sums due to
him.
That on the 20th of November, 1828, a. memorandum was
made out of the sums thus due, and handed to Nehemiah, as
evidence of the amoupt for which the land was held.
At the time this deed was executed, no one of the notes held
by Babcock was surrendered, nor the mortgage to Francis
Wyman, deceased. All the evidences of indebtedness remained
in the hands of Babcock, Nehemiah holding only the memorandum of the sums. The total amount of the notes in said
memorandum, with interest to the 20th November, 1828,
amounted to the sum of $2,083.87.
Upon receiving the above deed, Babcock took possession
under it, not only of the eleven acres, but of the adjoinin&acre.
Babcock, it is alleged, received annually, from sales of clay,
grass, and ledge stone, from the land, nore than enough to pay
interest and taxes. Nehemiah having removed to the West,
regardless of his trust, Babcock sold the land at private sale,
without notice to the said Nehemiah, and in fraud of his rights,
for eight thousand dollars.
In the sale, Babcock represented himself to be the sole.owner
of the premises. On the 4th of February, 1853, Nehemiah
conveyed his right to redeem to Edward Wyman, the complainant, &c. Within two years, Babcock has promised Wil1iam Wyman, acting for his brother, that he vould come to an
account with Nehemiah for the price of the land, and pay him
the proceeds of the sales, deducting the debts aforesaid, if he
-would take his notes on time; and would refer the question of
amount of rents and profits to the arbitrament of neighbors.

DECEM3ER TERM, 1856.
Babcock v. Wymn.

Babcock has frequently, recently, admitted that it was originally intended that said deed should stand as security for the
amount set forth in the memorandum; and that he always intended to do right in the matter, but that he had been advised
by counsel, that the agreement, not being in writing, could not
be enforced, and this was the reason he refused to perform it.
The bill prays for an account, and the defendant in his answer admits the conveyance stated in the bill, and that the
land was subject to the mortgages. He avers the consideration
named in the deed was the amount then due defendant in his
own right, and as executor and trustee; and the further sum
of $8.10, due the defendant, and $50 due as agent. He admits
no additional consideration was paid; but he states the land
was not worth more than $1,900; that he consented to receive
the deed in payment of the sums due him personally, and upon
an agreement that if he should be able to obtain therefrom, in
addition, enough to pay the sums due to him as executor and
trustee, he would pay these sums, and upon no other trust or
confidence whatever.
That, upon the delivery of the deed, he cancelled the notes
of Nehemiah held in his own right, and either surrendered
them to him or destroyed them. That he did not cancel the
notes held by him as executor or trustee, because he was not
satisfied that he should receive enough from the land to pay
the same; and in order to prevent the presumption that he had
so agreed absolutely, he made a minute thereon to the effect
that he did nbt guaranty the payment thereof, it being the
-understanding between him and lNehemiah, that lNehemiah
should be personally liable therefor.
That he made no other agreement, and he denies that it was
understood or agreed, that the land was conveyed to him on
the trust set forth in the bill; but insists that the conveyance
was absolute, in payment of the sums due him, and liabilities
incurred; and the only understanding was, that if the defendant should realize therefrom more than enoqgh to pay his own
claims, he would pay the debts due him as executor and trustee.
Defendant took possession of the land, and for eight years
occupied it, Nehemiah never claiming any interest in it. He
denies the allegations of the bill, as to the trust; sets up the
defence, that the agreement, not being in writing, carinot be enforced. He denies that he proposed a compromise, if his notes
would be taken on time, as alleged, and he pleads the statute
of twenty years limitation, &c., and avers the profits of the land
did not exceed the taxes, &c.
Three points may be considered as embracing the merits of
this case:

296

SUPREME COURT.
Babcock v. Wymanm

1. Was the deed executed by Nehemiah Wyman to Babcock,
for the eleven and one-half acres of ground, given in trust?
2. Can this trust be established by parol evidence?
3. Does the statute of limitation or lapse of time affect the
I . I
complainant's rights?
No one can read the history of this case, as stated in the bill,
without being impressed with the c.onfidential relations of the
parties. The grantor and the grantee were brothers-in-law,
and the advisers bore the same relation to the grantee. Itwas
a family concern, designed, as it would seem from the bill, to
aid an embarrassed member of it, without a probability of loss
by the other members.
The bill charges, when the deed in question was executed,
the sums .which it was intended to secure were stated, and
handed to Nehemiah. This is not denied in the answer, and
William Wyman, the brother, being present, swears, as a witness, to the sums so stajed, amounting in the whole to the sum
of $2,033.87, the consideration named in the deed. This list
was in the handwriting of the son of Babcock, and the paper
was delivefed to Nehemiah' in the presence of the witness.
The deed was drawn by the witness, and be knows that, the
sums named included -all the debts which Nehemiah owed to
Babcock individually, or as trustee. â€¢The witness remembers
Babcock said, after the statement was made, add sixty-two
cents for recording the deed, which made the sum inserted as
the consideration in the deed. Nehemiah hesitated to sign
the deed, when Babcock said, he can have the land again, at
any time he shall pay the debts secured by it.
The answer avers, when the deed was executed, the defendant gave up the notes of Nehemiah held in his own right, and
either surrendered them to him or destroyed them. But it is
proved by the same witness'that he did neither. These notes
were given to the witness without explaining to whom they
belonged. Witness supposed they belonged to the estate of
Nehemiali Wyman, sen.
The witness says, the property, at the time it was sold, was
worth thirteen or fourteen thousand dollars, and that it was
sold greatly below its value.
The bill charges, that the defendant promised William Wyman, acting for his brother, that he would come to an account
with Nehemiah for the price of the land, and pay him the proceeds of sales. This is denied in the answer. "William Wyman swears, that on the 8th of November, 1851, he showed to
Babcock the memorandum of the sums named, to secure the
ayment of which the deed was executed. He was much emarrassed, and admitted the handwriting was his son's, the.

deceased. He then expressed a willingness to settle it up,
and asked tho witness, how shall this be done? Witness replied, that he should first charge Nehemiah with all his notes
and interest, and then credit him with the proceeds of the
land, and what he received froifi the land, with interest, and be
allowed a fair compensation for his trouble. He then said, I
can't tell how much I have received from the land, but we will
leave it to two good men; and that he would give his note for
What should be due.
A short time after this, Babcock told witness that he had
consulted counsel, who advised him to pay the amount due
the estate of Nehemiah, sen.,"and no more; and this he offered
to do,if the witness would execute a bond of indemnity against
any farther claim. He said that he had been advised, as the
deed was absolute on its face, and no writing showed that the
land was conveyed in security of adebt, the obligation could
not be enforced.
The witness sigfiified to Babcock, some time before the sale
of the land, that he would redeem it for his brother.
Nehemiah Wyman, having transferred all his interest to the
complainant, was examined as a witness, *ho stated, at the
time he executed the deed to Babcock, he owed him, as an individual, as executor and agent, the sum of $2,033.87, which
included sixty-two cents for recording the deed; ,and that sum
was stated as the consideration in the deed. Of this sum, only
$408.18, and interest, were due to Babcock in his. individual
capacity.
. In his answer,, the defendant states that the-conveyance was
made in payment of the sums due him personally; that he did
not cancel the notes held'by him as executor or trustee, because he was not satisfied that he should receive enough from
the land to pay those debts. But the proof shows, that the
debt due him as executor and agent, and also his individual
debt, were all included in the consideration named in the deed.
The defendant made no advance to the witness, on the note
and mortgage for twelve hundred dollars; but, at the date of
the subsequent conveyance, the defendant had advanced to
him $400.08, and $8.10, which, as above stated, constituted
the debt due to the defendant on his personal account.
The conveyance. was made to the defendant, the witness
swears, with the express understanding, that Babcock was to
have the entire management of the land, so as to apply the
proceeds in payment of the interest, and witness was to have
the landagain on paying the'sums specified: He was induced
to make the conveyance by the urgent request of his brother
William, and Babcock; his brother told him, if he did ndt

298

SUPREME COURT.
Babcock v. Wyman.

make it, he would not assist him in his pecuniary matters.
On the execution of the deed, none of the notes held by Babcock were cancelled, or surrendered to the witness; but they
are still held against him.
. The witness says that Babcock promised to keep an account
of the receipts of the land conveyed to him; but in his answer
he says he kept no account, "because the land and rents and
profits were his own, without any liability to account to any
one."
Such a transaction as set out in the bill, between brothersin-law, in the nature of things might be suppoied t6 have
taken place in the mutual confidence of the parties; and in the
final adjustment there should be no evasions or subterfuges to
gain an advantage. So far as regards the deed under consideration, all the material allegations of the bill are proved, and
all the material averments of the answer seem to be unfounded.
In coming to this conclusion, we do not rest alone on the witnesses, Nehemiah and William Wyman. There are strong
circumstances which corroborate the witnesses, and satisfy the
mind beyond a reasonable doubt.
In his answer, the defendant avers that the land was conveyed to him in payment of the sums due him personally. It
appears from the oaths of both the Wymans that this is not
correct; and, in addition, it is shown by the memorandum made
out at the time, stating the sums for which the land was conveyed, in the handwriting of the son of the defendant.
Taking the statement of the defendant as true, that he did
not intend to make himself responsible for the debt due to him
as executor and ageht at the time the deed was executed, presents him in' an unfavorable light. The land for which he
received a deed from Xiehemiah Wyman,. he was aware, had
been previously mortgaged to secure the-debt in his hands as
executcr of Francis Wyman. Could he have carried out this
declared intention, he would have been unfaithful to the trust
committed to him.
William Wyman seems to be a man of business. He drew
the conveyance from his brother Nehemiah to his br6ther-inlaw Babcock, and he took, in other-respects, an active agency
in the transaction; and he states the facts as alleged in +h'e
bill, and his statement is in .every respect corroborated by his
brother NTehemiah; and although the trust is denied in the
answer, there are circumstrnces in the case which go strongly
to establish -it.
The defendant admitted all the facts to William Wyman,
and promised to settle the account, and spoke of the principles
oh which it should be adjusted, but eventually he took refuge

BabwAc v. Wyman.

under the statutes of frauds, of limitations, and the ]apse of
time. We think there can be no reasonable doubt that the
deed in controversy was intended to be a mortgage. And this
brings us to the second point of inquiry:
Can the trust be established by parol testimony?
If the doctrine of this court is to be adhered to, as laid down
in the case of Russell v. Southard, (12 How., 154,) this is not
an open question. In that case the court say: "To insist on
what was really a mortgage, as a sale, is in equity a fraud."
And in Conway v. Alexander, (7 Cranch, 238,) Chief Justice
Marshall says: "Having made these observations on the deed
itself, the court will proceed to examine those extrinsic circumstances whidh are to determine whether it was a sale or a mortgage." In Morris v. Nixon, (1 How., 126,) the court say:
" The charge against Nixon is substantially a fraudulent attempt to convert that into an absolute sale, which was originally
meant to be a security for a loan. It is in this view of the case
that the evidence is admitted to ascertain the truth of the
transaction, though the deed be absolute on its face."
In Edrington v. Harper, (3 J. J. Marshall, 355,) the court
say: "The fact that the real transaction between the parties
was a borrowing and lending, will, whenever or however it
may appear, show that a deed absolute on its face was intended
as a security for money; and whenever it can be ascertained
to be a security for money, it is only a mortgage, however artfully it may be disguised."
In- Jenkins v. Eidredge, (3 Story's Rep., 293,) Mr. Justice
Story said: In 4 Kent, 143, (5th edit.,) it is declared, "a deed
absolute upon the face of it, and though registered as a deed,
will be valid and effectual as a mortgage between the parties,
if it was intended by them to be mnerely a security for a debt.
And this would be the case, though the defeasance was by an
agreement resting in parol; for parol evidence is admissible to
show that an absolute deed was intended as a mortgage, and
that the defeasance had been omitted by fraud or mistake."
In 2 Sumner's Rep., 228, 232-23, Judge Story said: "It is the
same, if it be omitted by design upon mutual confidence between the parties; for the violation of such an agreement
would be a fraud of the most flagrant kind, originating in an
open breach of trust against conscience and justice."
In Foy v. Foy, (2 Hayward, 141:) "In North Carolina, it is
said the law on this subject is the same as the English law
was before the statute of frauds, and .parol declarations of
trust are valid.'- "Where a testator gave by will all his estate
to his wife, having confidence that she would dispose of it according to his views communicated to her, and it being alleged

800

that the testator, at the time of making the will, desired his
wife to give the whole of the projerty to B, and that she
promised to do it, it was held, that the allegation being proved,
a trust would be created as to the whole of the property iii
favor of B." (Podmore v. Gunning, 7 Simons, 644.)
Parol proof is admissible to show fraud, and consequently a
resultin trust, in a deed absolute on its face, notwithstanding

.

In Boyd v: McLean, (1 John. Oh. Rep., 582,) it'was held,
after an examination of the cases, "that a resulting trust might
be established by parol proof, not only against the face of the

purchasers denying the trust, and even after the death of such
purchaser." The statute of frauds in Rhode Island contains
no exception in favor of resulting trusts, but Mr. Justice Story
considered the exception ipnmaterial, for it has been deemed
merely affirmative of the general law.' (1 Sumner, 187.)

The case of Walker v. Locke et al. (5 Oushing, 90) is considered as having no application to the case before us. It is
well. known that until within a few years the courts of Massachusetts had no chancery jurisdiction. The jurisdiction, when
frst conferred by statute, was limited to cases of specific exq-

cution of contracts and trusts, not including fraud as a ground
ofrelief. Within some one or two years past, the jurisdiction
has been extended to frauds, but this has been done since the
decision in the case above cited.
If the decision had been n~ade since the extension of the
jurisdiction beyond the construction of the local statutes, we
should consider it only as the decision of a highly respectable
and learned court, and not as a rule of decision for this court.
It is admitted that the authorities on the question before us
are conflicting in this country and in England; but as this
court in several cases have decided the point, and it is now
and has been for several years past a rule of decision, we are
4ot prepared to balance the State authorities, with the view of
ascertaining on which side the scale preponderates.
The third point regards the lapse of time and the statute of
limitations.
In his answer, the defendant avers that the pleadings show a
possession by him of more than twenty years before the institution of this suit, and that that possession has never been
disturbed; and also that the proceeds of sale were received
more than six years before the bill was filed, and these facts
are relied on to bar the right of the complainant.
It is clear that the statute cannot constitute a bar in the
present case. Courts 'of equity apply the statute by analogy
to cases at law; but in this case, the trust being established,
there was no adverse possession in favor of whici the statute
could run. The possession was consistent with the intentions
of the parties, until the fraud was discovered, in 1851. Nor
can the statute bar the right of the complainant to the proceedsof the land, as Babcock was bound to apply these to the
payment of interest on the debt6, and in discharge of the principal.
The decree of the Circuit Court is afirmed witth costs.

Mr; Justice CATRON dissenting.
The opinion just pronounced maintains that a deed in fee,
without conditions, and made in that form, according to an
agreement of the parties at the time, may.be proved to have
been a mortgage by parol evidence, establishing that a defeasauce was part of the agreement when the'absolute deed was
executed; but that it was left. out by design. And that this
parol proof may be made, after the lapse of more than twenty
years from the date of the deed before the grantee was sued;

he having been in possession of the land conveyed, holding it
under the deed from its date up to the time when the suit was
brought.
The defendant (among other things) relied on the statute of
frauds as a flefence to the suit. Lord Hardwicke lays down
the rule (in Montacute v. Maxwell, 1 P. Williams, 618) to be,
that where there was no fraud or mistake in the original transaction, and the word or promise of the defendant was relied
on, the statute of frauds declaies such promise void, and equity
will not interfere. And in this doctrine I understand the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts to concur. (Walker v.
ocke, 5 Gush., 90.)
The effect of the defeasance here set up, by parol evidence,
is, that it defeats the absolute deed, and makes it void on payment of a sum of money. On general principles the rule is,
that where there is a written contract, all antecedent propositions, negotiations, and parol interlocutions, on the same subject, are deemed to be merged in such contract. (1 Story Com.,
p. 178, sec. 160; 2 Story, p. 286, see. 1,018.)
There must b4 fraud or mistake in making the agreement,
if it can be reformed. (Id., sec. 157, p. 169.)
I think the parol proof was inadmissible both by the statute
of frauds of Massachusetts, and according to the general rule
referred to; and that the decree should be reversed, and the
bill dismissed.
Mr. Justice CAMPBELL dissenting.
The defendant, in the year 1828, entered upon the land conveyed to him by Nehemiah Wyman, and retained it until 1844.
He then sold it as his own property, and appropriated the price
to his own use. During this whole period, there was no act on
the part of Wyman from which the relation of a mortgagor or
debtor can be inferred, and no account was rendered by the
defendant, nor was any act performed by him inconsistent with
his deed.
The evidence relied on to engraft a trust on this deed consists of conversations reported by Nehemiah Wyman, the
debtor, and his brother William, as contemporaneous with the
deed, and other conveisations reported by William Wyman as
occurring in 1844 and 1851; and also the statements of the
answer.
No interc6urse between Nehemiah Wyman and the defendant took place between 1828 and 1851, directly or mediately,
relative to-this subject.
The witness, Nehemiah. Wyman, is not, in my opinion, a
competent witness. This suit is brought by his son upon an

was found that sufficient evidence did not exist to support
-It
the claim, and machinery was resorted to, calculated to introduce the evils of champerty and maintenance.
The witness sold his clain, with a concession to the assignee
to employ him as a witness to establish it.
Such a practice holds out to parties a strong temptation to
commit perjury. (Bell v. Smith, 5 B. and C., 188, J. Bayley's
.Opinion; Maury v. Mason, 8 Part., 212; Clifton v. Sharpe, 15
Ala. k., 618; 1 Penu. R., 214; 12 Pet., 140.)
The testimony of Edward Wyman is open to much observation; and I feel entirely indisposed to rest a decree upon his
evidence. Nor do I see intrinsic difficulties in the inconsistencies of the answer, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that
nothing has been done between these parties for above twentythree years inconsistent with the relations of vendor and vendee, or consistent with the relations of a creditor and debtor,
except the detention of the evidence of the original debt by
the defendaht, and the most important part of that evidence
.was cancelled in 1830 by him.
I dissent'from the opinion of the court in reference to the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the United States in Massachusetts. It is admitted that, in the courts of Massachusetts,
this trust could not be incorporated into the deed. The statute
of frauds prevents it. (Walker v. Locke, 5 Cush., 90.)
This statute constitutes a rule of property for the State. In
the present case, the'subject of the suit is a contract made in
Massachusetts, by citizens of that State; and affecting the title
there. In my opinion, the statute law of Masto real property
-sachusetts
furnishes
a rule of decision to the courts of the United States.

Where there was a judgment for costs against the-plaintiff, in a suit where the defendant pleaded a discharge in bankruptcy, and- the attorney for the defendant
taxed those costs, directed the property upon which an execution should be levied
for their collection, prepared the advertisements for the sale of it, caused a sale
to *befhade of fourteen thousand acres of land, to produce a few dollars as costs,
and then became himself the purchaser, the sale will be decreed fraudulent and

void, and ordered to be set aside.

THIS was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the eastern district of Arkansa, sitting inequity.
