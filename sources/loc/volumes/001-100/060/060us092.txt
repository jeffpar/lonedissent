SUPREME COURT.
United iStates v. Brig Neurea.

This is nothing more than an agreement for a special and
limited partnership iin the business of transporting freight and
passengers between New York and San Francisco, and the
mere fact that the transportation is by sea, and not by land,
will not be sufficient to give 'the court of admiralty jurisdiction of an action for a breach of the contract. It is not one of
those to which the peculiar principles or remedies given by
the maritime law have any special application, and is the fit
subject for the jurisdiction of the common-law courts.
The decree of the Circuit Court is therefore affirmed.

THE UNITED STATES, APPELLANTS, v. THE BRIG :NEUREA, HER

SUPREME COURT.
tnited Statu v. Brig ffeurea.

'The court below sustained the demurrer and dismissed the
libel, from which decree the United States appealed.
It was argued for the United States by Mr. Cushing, (Attorney General.)
Mr. Justice GRIER delivered the opinion of the court.
The Swedish brig Neurea was seized by the collector of
customs at San Francisco, as*forfeited to the United States
under the passenger act of 1847. The record in this case exhibits the libel for information, filed on behalf of the United
States, a demurrer thereto by the claimant, and, a decree of
the court below dismissing the libel. The appeal, therefore,
brings under review the question of the sufficiency of the libel.
The claimant sets forth the following grounds of demurrer:
1. That the said libel states no sufficient cause of cond~mnation of said ship.
2. Because the said libel states no offence against the laws
of the United States.
8. Because the said libel does not aver that the excess of
passengers carried or imported on said ship were so carried or
imported on the lower deck of said brig, or the orlop deck
thereof.
4. Because the facts stated in said libel do not constitute a
v.olation of the passenger act of the United States of 1847, or
an other law of the United States.
The first, second, and fourth, are but different forms of the
same general assertion, "-that the libel states no offence."
The third, which is more specific, objects to the libel for
want of an averment that the passengers were carried on the
lower deck.
An information for forfeiture of a vessel need not be more
technical in its language, or specific in its description of the
offence, than an indictment. As a general rule, an indictment
for a statute offence is sufficient, if it describe the offence in
the very words of the statute. The exceptions to this rule
are, where the offences created by statute are analogous to
certain common-law felonies or misdemeanors, where the precedents require certain technical language, or where special
averments .are necessary in the description of the partidular
offence in order that the defendant may afterwards protect
himself under the plea of autrefois acquit or convict. (See on
-this sAbject United States v. Gooding, 12 Wheaton, 474.)
The offence created by the statute on which this libelis
founded has no-analogy to any particular common-law crime.
,f, therefore, the libel sets forth the offence in the words of

DEOEMBER TERM, 1856.
United Statu v. Brig .eurea.

the statute which creates it, with sufficient certainty as to the
time and place of its commission, it is all that is necessary to
put the claimant on his defence.
The object of the act in question is the protection of the
health and lives of passengers from becoming a prey to the
avarice of ship owners. In order to test the sufficiency of the
libel, it will be necessary to set forth at length the two sections
under which it was framed:
The first section provides, that no master ."shall take on
board such vessel, at any foreign port or place, a greater -number of passengers than in the following proportion to the space
occupied by them and appropriated to their use, and'unoccupied by stores or other goods not being the personal baggage
of such passengers, that is to say, on the lower deck or ,2atform,
one passenger for every fourteen clear superficial feet of deck,
if such vessel is not 'to pass within the tropics during such
voyage; but if such vessel is to pass within the tropics during
such voyage, then one passenger for every twenty such clear
superficial feet of deck; and on the.orlop deck, (if any,) one
passenger for every thirty such superficial feet in all cases,
â€¢with.intent to bring such passengers into the United States of
America, and shall leave such port, or place, with the same,
and bring the same, or any number thereof, within the jurisdicdiction of the United States aforesaid, or if any such master of
vessel shall take on board of his vessel, at anyport or place within
the jurisdiction of the United States aforesaid, any greater number of passengers than the proportions aforesaid admit, with the
intent to carry the same to any foreign port or place, every such
master shall be deemed guily of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction thereof before any circuit or district court of the
United States aforesaid, shall, for each passenger taken on
board beyond the above proportions, be fined in the sum of
fifty dollars, and may also be imprisoned for any term not exceeding one year: Provid,that this act shall not be construed
to permit any ship or vessel to carry more than two passengers
aforesaid, shall exceed the number limited by the last section,

to the number of twenty in the whole, such vessel shall be forfeited
to the United States aforesaid, and be prosecuted and distributed as forfeitures are under the act to regulate duties on imports and tonnage."
Now, the libel conforms strictly to the requirements of this
It avers, that the master "took on board the Neurea at

SUPREME COURT.
Seymour et at. v. McCormic_.

Hong Kong, in China, on the 1st of June, 1854, two hundred
and sixty-three passengers. That this wai a Ireater number
than in proportion to the space occupied by them, viz: "on
the lower deck or platform" one passenger for every fourteen
clear superficial feet, with intent to bring said passengers to
the United States. That he afterwards, viz: on the 26th day of
_August, did bring them on said vessel to the port of San Francisco. That the passengers so taken on board and brought
into the United States did exceed the number which could be
lawfully taken, to the number of twenty in the whole, &c.
The act does not require an averment that the passengers
"were carried or imported on the lower deck or the orlop
deck."
The libel sets forth every averment of time, place, numbers,
intention, and act, in the very words of the statute. It was not
necessary to specify the precise measurement of the deck, or
to show by a mathematical calculation its incapacity; nor to
state the- sex, age, color, or nation, of the passengers; nor how
many more than twenty their number exceeded the required
area on deck. All these particulars were matters of evidence,
which required no special averment of them to constitute a
complete and technical description of the offence.
The decree of the District Court is therefore reversed, and
record remitted for further proceedings.

WILLIAM H. SEYMOUR AND LAYTON S. MORGAN, PLAINTIFF9 IN
ERROR, V. CYRUS H. MCCORMICK.
The act of Congress passed on the 3d of March, 1837, (5 Stat. at L., 194,) provides
that a patentee may enter a disclaimer, if he has included in his patent what he
was not the inventor of; but if he recovers judgment against an infringer of his
patent, he shall not be entitled to costs, unless he has entered a disclaimer for
the part not invented.
It also provides that if a patentee unreasonably neglects or delays to enter a disclaimer, he shall not be entitled to the benefit of the section at all.
In 1845, McCormick obtained a patent for improvements in a reaping machine, in
which, after filing hia specification, he claimed, amongst other things, as follows, viz:
"2d. I claim the reversed angle of the teeth of the blade, in manner described.
413d. I claim the arrangement and construction of the fingers, (or teeth for supporttIg the grain,) so as to form the angular spaces in front of the blade, as and for
the purpose described."
These two clauses are not to be read in connection with each other, but separately.
The first claim, viz: for "the reversed angle of the teeth of the blade," not being new, and not being disclaimed, he was not entitled to costs, although he recovered a judgment for a violation of other parts of his patent.
Under the circumstances of the case, the patentee was not guilty of unreasonable
neglect or delay in making the disclaimer, which is a question of law for the
court tb decide.
