would not in any respect have resulted to his benefit.

MARY D,

There is one difficulty of which the Court are fully i.xs. co.
aware, *hich is, that the interest assigned in the abandonment ifestimated in rubles will be inversely as the
rate at which the ruble is estimated, so that he who
pays most would acquire least. But in this &ase the
objection does not arise; as the Plaintiff by a compromise with the underwriters on some of the other policies has reserved a suflicient interest ii the subject of
abandonment, to meet the just claims of these underwriters. And in no case would this consideration create a difficulty as between the parties to a policy.
Among the underwriters alone in the distribution of tile
proceeds of the thing abandoned would it be necessary
to determine on the correct rule to be applied in such a
case.
Had the policy, which is the subject of this suit, been
a valved policy, and declared the value of t'e whole
cargo to be 9 43,929, the actual amount at the stipulated
valuation of the ruble, the same objection would have
presented itself, but certainly would not have availed to
prevent a recovery.
The judgment below must therefore be reversed and
!he case remanded.

This case is very distinguishable from that of Bar.

Ist. Tn that case, the voyage was interrupted
as tn
the ultimate and only'port of destination. Here,there
was an interupti.i as to an intermediate port only,
which cannot, we contend, constitute a total loss. The
adventkre from Teneriffe to Philadelphia, might have
been as profitable as the acconmplishment of the whole
voyage.
Anlther distinction between the two cases ariSes from
the diffierent phraseology eniph.yed in the respective
policies. The English policy employs general words,
so as to include any detention of pinces, &c. Here,
the policy is limited to uniauful detention of princes,
&c. Unlessm, therefore, this detention can be shown to
be unlawful, the case is not within'the plicy; and it is
clear, that it was not unlawful, tinless the blockade was
so. But this is not contended; the blockade was maintained by an adew:-ate force, and was in every respect
oonformable to the law of nations.

The abandonment itself, in the tase .now before the
Court, is liable to objebtion. An abandonment, to be
valid, ought to' be anhe during the impediment that
causes the loss. But in this case, the abandonment was
not made till long after the impediment had ceased.
PiEN EEY, same side.
It was contended by the Defendants in the Court below, that they were not liable for the loss in this case,
1st. Because, under the words of the policy, that loss
did not arise from any peril insured against
2d. Because the Plafntiffs had violated their warranty
of neutrality.
3d. Because at the time when the abandonment was
made, the property was not under the restraint of princes.
The same grounds of defence are now relied upon.
And, first, as to the words of the policy. This instrutient insures against i unlaful arrests, restraints
and detainments of all kings, &c. The word "unlalvfid" is that which the Defendants consider as taking the
present case out of the policy., This word is not inserted in the English policies, but has been introduced into
those of the Marine Insurance Company and some other American offices. Some meaning must be given to
t.he term, and that can be no other than the most usual
meaning; so that unless it can be made to appear that
the detainment in this case was unlawfld, the Defendants
cannot be considered as liable. But, as has been said
before, the blockade, which was the cause of the detain.
ment, was lawful ; the detainment itself was therefore
lawful. under the acknowledged law of nations.

FEBRUARY TERM 18i1.
2d. As to the warranty of neutrality.

M'CALL
'V.

When the voyage was undertaken, and the policy un- MARINE
derwritten, neither party knew that the port of destina- INs. co.
tion was blockaded; but the underwriters protected
themselves by a warranty of neutrality, and the assured consented to give it.
The import of the warranty is that the voyage shall
be performed in a neutral. manner; and, consequently,,
that if the vessel should find the 'port blockaded, she
will discontinue the voyage. She does find it blockaded; and not only physical force, -but the law of nations and the warranty oblige her to forbear the completion of the voyage. She, nevertheless attempts to enter
the port, and that, too, after being warned off by the
admiral commanding the blockading squadron. Has
the assured- in such a case, a right to set up the compliance with his own warranty as the foundation of a
total loss, or of any loss ? With such a warranty in the
policy, can the underwriter be considered as engagin.9
that, if the port of destination should be found blockaded, the voyage shall be completed? If such i his engagement, then he stipulates that the vessiel shall violate the warranty ; because without a violation of i.,
she cannot reach her port of destination, if she finds it
blockaded. It is plain that his undertaking is only for
a neutral voyage; and, therefore, that, the iioment it
becomes unneutral, the policy is discharged by force o'
the warranty acting upon the whole contract.
Cases upon tle British orders in comicil are far less
strong than this; for they made no blockade acknowledged by the law of nations. Physical force was there
every thing; and neutral duties were not affetted by
them. But here, the neutral obligations of tie vessel
turn her back, and intercept her path, and extract the
case out of the policy.
3d. Here was no restraint of princes. Restraint must
be physical; and an abandonment, to be of any avail,
must be made during such restraint. In the present
case the physical restraint continued but one day; all
afterwards was mere moral restr-aint, arising from the
11ireat of capture and confiscation as prize of war. But

ist. With regard to the wording of the policy. It is
unnecessary to examine what effect the term, "unlawful," may have upon the subsequent words, inasmuch
asthe declaration states the loss to have been occasioned by men of war, with which the word , unlawful"
had no connexion. But if such examination be made,
it will appear that thi3 term applies on]) to the v ord
,,arrests," which, in the original printed form of the
policy, was separated from the following part of the
sentence by a comma, and was theri'ore the only word
qualified by the preceding term 66undawful." The pointing of the sentence was the act of the parlti' s. aii1, as
sach, rnaterial, and as much a part of the cuntract as
the wordsthemselves.
2d. As to the violation of the warranty of neutrality.
The loss was complet" before the second attempt to
enter the blockaded port; and therefore could not have
happened by reason of that att nrpt; con.sequiintly, the
right of tihe Plaintiffs to recov.-r, could not 4e alf cled
by trat or any other act of the master, subseqaent to
the original l6ss, however inconsistent with neutrality
that act might be.
3d. Witl regard to the time of abandoning: the
Plaintiffs abandoned immediately after the arrival of
the Cordelia at Phila'l lphia, which gAve them the first
information of the loss. To hay.' expectedl them to
abandon before they knew any thing of the loss wbuld
have been absolutely inconsistent with reason.

STORY, J. after stating the facts of the case, delivered the opinion of the Court as follows :
The Court below, at tie trial, held that the Plaintiff,
under the circumstances, was not entitled to abandon
as for a total loss; and the corrctness of that opinion
remains for the decision of this Court.
Whether the turning a-%yay ot'a ship from the port of
destination in conseqiuence of a blockade, be, in any
case, a good cause for abandonment, so as to entitle the
assured to recover from the underwriter as f,r a total
loss by the breaking up of the voyage; and, if so, whetier the doctrine could apply to a policy with a warranty of neutrality, the legal effect of such warranty
b(ing to compel the party to abandon the voyage, if it
cannot be pursued consistent with neutrality, are questions of great importance, upon which the Court do'not
think it necessary to express any opinion, because this
cause may well be decided upon an independent ground.
The loss of the voyage, in the case at bar, was occasioned (if at all) by the arrest and restraint of the
British blockading, squadron. The right to blockade
an enemy's p. rt with a competent force, is a right secured to every belligerent by the law of nations. No
neutral can, after knowledge of such blockade, lawfully
enter, or attempt to enter, the blockade port. It would
be a violation of neutral character, which, according to
established usages, would subject the property enga., d
therein to the penalty of confiscatiorr. It such a case,
therefore, the arrest and restraint of neutral ships attempting to enter the port is.,a la'wful arrest and restraint by the blockading squadron. It would follow,
therefore, from this consideration, that the arrest and
restraint, on account of which a recovery is now sought,
is not a risk within the policy against which the unde'
writer has engaged to indemnify the Plaintiff.
"
VOL. VIII.

V.
.1ARIll,

But it is contended by the counsel for the Plaintiff,
in order to escap , from this conclusion, that the word
66

unlaNful," in the policy, is confined in its operation

iNS. co. to arrests, and does not extend to - restraints and detainments." To this construction the Court cannot-assent. The grammatical order of the words and the coherence of the sentence require a different construction.
It is not against every ",unlawful arrest" that the underwriter undertakes to indemnify, but against iunlawful arrests, &c. of all kings, princes, and people,"
which have always been hehi to mean the arrests of
kings, princes, or people, in their sovereign and national capacity, and not as individuals. The necessary
connexion of the sentence, therefore, requires that-"arrests, restraints and detainments," should be coupled
together; and, if,
so, the qualification of unla-wful must
be annexed to them all. The intent of the parties, also,
urges to the same conclusion ; for every arrest is a restraint and detainment; and it would be strange if the
party coulil, unider the allegation of a restraint, recover
a loss from which the underwriter is expressly exempted by -an unambiguous-exception in the policy.
On the whole, the uourt are of opinion that the judg
ment of the Circuit Court must be affirmed.
