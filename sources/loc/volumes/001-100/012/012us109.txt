STORY,

tionlaw of 2d

March, 1799,
which requires
a permit for
the landing of
goods imported, appliei to
goods the lir.

of
portation
The principal question .in. this .case is,. whether
. goods
"
which wasprand merchandize, the importation of which into the hlbhed bylaw.
United States was prohibited by the act of 18th ofV.pril,
1806, vol. 8, p. 80; were \Nithin the purview of the 50th
section of the collection act of 2d of March, t709, vol. !, I;

360, so that the unlading of'thdin 'vithout a l)ermit, &c.
was an offence subjecting thei to forfeitiui e.
It has been contended on behalf of the claiman't that
they were not wifthin the purviow of the 5oth section,
because that section applies olidy to goods, 'wares and
merchandize, the importation of which is lawful. To
this construction the Court cannot yiefd assent. The
language of the 50th section is, that - no g'oods, wares
or merchandize, &c. sh~tl be unladen, &c. without a permit ;" it is therefore broad enough to cover all goods,
whether lawful or unlawful. The case, being then
within the letter, can be extracted from forfeitere only
by shewing that it js not within the spirit of the section.
To us it seems clear that the case is within the policy
and mischief of the collection act, since the necessity of
a permit is some check upon unldwful impqrtations, and
is one reason why it is required. The act of 1806 doeÂ§
not profess to repeal the 50th section of the collection
act as to the prohibited goods, and a repeal by implication ought not to be presumed unles from the repugnance of the provisions the inference be necessary and

unavoidable. No such manifest repugnance appears to
the court. The provisions may well stand together and
indeed serve as mutual aids.

the same had been dischar. ed from the ship

From the

transcript in the case, it appears that the Emulous was
owned by John Delano and others, citizens of the Uoited
