The United States v. Guillem.

We deem it unnecessary to examine the other excejiions, as
we are all of the opinion, that the title to the property in controversy did not pass to the assignee, under the decree in bankruptcy. The judgment of the District Court is, therefore, affirmed.

v. BAITISTE
or SPECIE.

GUILLE,%i

CLAIIANT

A neutral leaving a belligerent country, in which he was domiciled at the commencement of the war; is entitled to the rights of a neutral in his person and property,
as soon as he sails from the hostile port.
The property he takes with him is not liable to condemnation for a breach of blockado by the vessel in which he embarks, when entering or departing from the
port, unless he know of the intention of the vessel to break it in going out.

Tnis was .an appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court of
the United States for the District of Louisiana, sitting as a
prize court.
Baptiste Guillem, a French citizen, was domiciled in Mexico,
and had resided there about three years before the war with
the United States was declared. His occupation was that of
cook in a hotel, and he was engaged in it in Vera Cruz when
hostilities with this country commenced. He was not natural.
ized and had taken no steps to become a citizen of Mexico.
He continued in Vera Cruz, pursuing his ordinary business,
until he learned that an attack was about to be made on the
city, by sea and land, by the~forces of the United States. He
immediately prepared to leav the country and return to France,
with his family, carrying with him all the money he had saved.
He intended to embark in the British steamer, which .was
expected to arrive at Vera Cruz early in March, 1847, afid
obtained a passport from the French consul for that purpose.
But the steamship was wrecked on the island of Cuba, and'
iid not reach Vera Cruz, and Guillem was still in that city
when General Scott landed and closely besieged it.
The port of Vera Cruz had been blockaded by the naval

forces of the United States from the commencement of the
war. When the land forces arrived, and the siege was about
to commence, General Scott and Commodore Perry (who
commanded the blockading squadron) agreed to leave the
blockade open to the consuls and other neutrals, to pass out to
their respective ships of war, until the 22d of March, after
which all communication with the besieged city was interdicted.
On the 13th of March, a French vessel called La Jeune Nelly
came into the port, having run the blockade. She came in
in the daytime, with her colors flying, nor is there any evidence
in the record to show that it was known in Vera Cruz that she
had come into pdrt without permission from the blockading
ships. - She sailed again on the 19th of March, bound for
Havre, in open day, and without manifesting any desire for
concealment, but yet in breach of the blockade. But there was
no evidence that Guillem knew she came in or was sailing out
in breach of the blockade. Guillem took passage on board of
this vessel with his family, and took with him in gold and silver two thousand eight hundred and sixty dollars, - the whole
amount of his three years' earnings in'Mexico. The Jeune
Nelly had no cargo and sailed in ballast. The money of
Guillem was not shipped as cargo, nor invoiced, but was taken
with him as a part of his personal effects. The money was
chiefly in two bags, which were kept in his state-room, but a
part of it was in a belt about his person.
The Jeune Nelly was captured by the blockading squadron
a few hours after she sailed; and on the night following was
wrecked and totally lost on one of the islands near the port;
but the passengers, crew, and all the money and property on
board, were saved. The passengers and crew were immediately released, and the money of Guillem and other property on
board were taken possession of by the orders of Commodore
Perry, and sent to New Orleans for adjudication. It was libelled in the District Court, and condemned, as lawfully seized.
Guillem appealed from this decree to the Circuit Court, where
it was reversed, and the money in question directed to be restored and refunded to him. The captors appealed from this
last-mentioned decree to the Supreme Court.
It was argued by 1lr. Crittenden (Attorney-General), for the
appellants, and 1M1r. Souli, for the claimant.
Mrl. Critlenden, fbr the appellants.
As it has been set up and insisted on that Guillem, in embarking on board the Jeune Nelly, acted under permission of
General Scott, it is necessarv to ascertain what actually took

place at the time at Vera Cruz. The correspondence of General Scott,.as to the operations of the army before Vera Cruz,
will be found annexed to President Polk's message to Congress
of December, 1847, in 1 Senate Docurients, p. 216, et seq.
From this correspondence it appears that the landing of the
troops was effected on the 9th of March, and that on the 13th,
in answer to a request of the French and Spanish consuls that
in his operations he might respect the persons and property of
French and Spanish subjects, he communicated to them, that
in carrying the city, whether by bombardment or assault, it
would be exceedingly difficult, particularly in the night-time, for
his forces to see the consular flags, or to discriminate between
the persons and property of friends aid the persons and property of the enemy; he could, therefore, only promise to do all
that circumstances might possibly permit to cause such discrimination to be observed. He also sent them safeguards under his signature. (p. 219.) By a letter of his to Commodore
Per.ry, of the 22d, it appears that up to that time intercourse
had been allowed between the neutral vessels of war and the
city and castle of Vera Cruz, but was then put an end to.
(p. 228.) And a communication to that effect was made by
Commodore Perry to the commanders of the neutral ships
of war. (p. 228.) It was not until the 24th that the British,
French, Spanish, and Prussian consuls addressed General
Scott, praying him to suspend hostilities, and to grant a truce,
to enable their countrymen to leave the place with their women and children. (p. 229.) In a despatch to the Secretary of
War, under date of the 25th, General Scott says: - " All the
batteries, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, are in awful "activitvthis morning. The effect is no doubt very great, and I th.ink the city
cannot hold out beyond to-day. Tomorrow morning many
of the new mortars will be in a position to add their fire, when,
or after the delay of some twelve bours, if no proposition to
surrender should be received, I shall organize parties for carrying the city by assault. So ar, the defence has been spirited
and obstinate.
"I inclose a copy of a memorial received last night, signed
by the consuls of Great Britain, France, Spain, and Prussia,
within Vera Cruz, asking me to grant a truce to enable the
neutrals, together with Mexican women and children, to withdraw from The scene of havoc about them. I shall reply, the
moment that an opportunity may. be taken, to say, - 1st.
That a truce can only be granted on the application of Governor Morales, with a view to a surrender. '2d. That in sending
safeguards to the different consuls, beginning as far back' as
the 13th instant, I distinctly admonished them, particularly the
VOL. XI.

French and Spanish consuls, and of course through the two
the bther consuls, of the dangers that have followed. 3d. That
although at that date I had already refused to allow any person whatever to pass the line of investment either way, yet the
blockade had been left open to the consuls and other neutrals,
to pass out to their respective ships of war, up to the 22d instant. And, 4th. I shall inclose to the memorialists a copy of
my summons to the governor, to show that I had fully considered the hardships and distresses of the place, including
those of w.omen and children, before one gun had been fired in
that direction. The intercourse between the neutral ships of
war and the city was stopped at the last-menti6ned date, with
my concurrence, which I placed on the ground that that intercourse could not fail to give to the enemy moral aid and com.
fort." (pp. 225, 226.)
General Scott accordingly, on the same day, addressed a
communication to the consuls of the nature above indicated,
,in which he says that he deeply regrets the lateness of their
application, for up to the 22d- instant the communication between the neutrals in Vera Cruz and the neutral ships of war
lying off Sacrifieio was left open, mainly to allow those neutrals an opportunity to escape from the horrors of the impend.
ing siege, of which he gave to the consuls every admonition in
his power. (pp. 230, 231.) This communication was -made
known to the Mexican general, and led to the capitulation.
From the preceding narrative it appears that the only permission to neutrals given by General Scott or Commodore
Perry, was to pass from Vera Cruz to the ships of war of their
respective nations.
No treaty stipulations between the United States and
France, on the subject of blockade, were in existence at the
date of these occurrences. There was a convention made be.
tween them on the subject, in 1800, but which was to last
only eight years. After the expiration of that time, it does not
seem to have been renewed.
The cause is now to be heard in the Supreme Court, on an
appeal taken by the United States from so much of the decree
of the Circuit Court as is in favor of Guillem for the amount
claimed by him.
There can be no question that the Jeune Nelly was liable to
capture for breach of the blockade, and such was the answer of
our own government to that of France, when it made reclamation on behalf of the owner for the value of the vessel. She
was guilty of a violation of blockade, both in going into Vera
Cruz and coming out of it.
The guilt of a breach inward is not discharged until the end

of the return voyage; and if a vessel is taken in any part of
that voyage, she is taken in delicto. The Frederick Molke, 1
Rob. 87 ; The Lisette,.6 Rob. 395 ; The Joseph, 8 Cranch, 451.
The act of egress is as culpable as the act of ingress. The
case of the Frederick Molke, above cited, is identical with
the present. The Vrouw Judith, 1 Rob. 151; The Neptunus,
1 Rob. 171; The Adelaide, 2 Rob. 111, note. The cases of
the Juffrow Maria Schrceder, 3 Rob. 153, and the Welvaart
Van Pillaw, 2 Rob. 130, decide that the offence of running a
blockade' outward is not purged until the end of the voyage,
and that until then the vessel so grilty is subject to capture by
any cruiser of the blockading power.
There are exceptions in the case of egress. "A ship that
has entered previous to the blockade may retire 'in ballast, or
taking a cargo that has been put on board before the blockade."
The Juno, 2 Rob. 118. That a belligerent may lawfully
blockade the port of his enemy is admitted; but it is also admitted that this blockade does not, according to modern usage,
extend to a neutral vessel found in port, nor prevent her coming
out with the cargo which was on board when the blockade was
instituted. Olivera v. Union Insurance Company, 3 Wheat.
194; 1 Kent, 147. The Jeune Nelly does not come within
either of these exceptions. There are other exceptions, for
which see Wheaton's Elements, 548, and 2 Wildman, 201, but
which have no bearing in this case.
Bat to come to the question in the case, Were the property
and effects of the neutral Guillem, on board the Jeune Nelly
when she broke the blockade outward, liable to capture ? The
court below has decided they were *not, on the ground that
Guillem had left Mexico with an intention to return to France,
and therefore was no longer a resident of the power with whom
the United States were at war. It is a weil-known law, that,
if a neutral reside in the country of one of the belligerents, his
property and effects sent from that country are liable to capture by the other, as enemy's property, wherever found on the
ocean. 1 Kent's Com. 75. A national character, however acquired by residence, may be thrown off at pleasure by a return
to the native country, It is an adventitious character, and
ceases by non-residence, or when a party puts himself in motion, bonld fide, to quit the country, sine anino revertendi, and
such an intention is 'essential to enable him to resuine his
native character. 1 Kent's Com. 78.
But with all due deference it is submitted that these doc-'
trines have no application in a case of capture for breach of
blockade. A blockade has the effect to seal and shut up-the
blockaded port against all trade whatsoever. Sir William

52

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Guillem.

Scott says it would not properly be a blockade unless neutrals
were restricted.
" A .blockade may .be more or less rigorous, either for the
single purpose of watching the military operations of the
enemy, and preventing the egress of their fleet, as at Cadiz;
or on a more extended scale, to cut off all access of neutral
vessels to that interdicted place, which is strictly and properly
a blockade; for the other is, in truth, no blockade at all, as far
as neutrals are concerned. It is an undoubted right of belligerents to impose such a blockade, though a severe right, and
as such not to be extended by construction ; it may operate
as a grievance onneutrals, but it is one to which, by the law
of nations, they are bound to submit." The Juffrow Mlaria
Schrceder, 3 Rob. 154.
The decision in the case of the Vrouw Judith, 1 Rob. 151,
which was a case of violation of blockade outward by a neutral, says: "Now, with respect to the matter of blockade,. I
must observe that a blockade is just as much violated by a
vessel passing outwards as inwards. A blockade is a sort of
circunvallation round a place, by which all -foreign connection
and correspondence is, as far as human, force can effect it, to
be entirely cut off. It is intended to suspend the entire commerce of the place, and a neutral is no more at liberty to assist'the traffic of exportation than of importation."
" To shut up the ports of a country, and exclude neutrals
from all commerce, is a. great inconvenience upon them,
although it is one to which they are bound to submit; for
there is no principle of the law of naticns better established,
than that a belligerent has a right to impose a blockade on the
ports of his enemy." The Juno, 2 Rob. 117.
On the part of the United States it will therefore be contended:1. That the money of Guillem was liable to capture.
The consequence of a breach of blockade is the confiscation
of the ship, and the cargo is always prirndfacieimplicated in the
guilt of the owner and master of the ship. 1 Kent's Com. 151.
In the case of the Mercurius, 1 Rob. 84, it is decided that,
to make the conduct of the ship affect the cargo, it is necessary
to show that the owners of the cargo were conusant of the
blockade before the cargo was shipped; or to show that the
act of the master binds them.
The blockade of Vera Cruz was established shortly after the
declaration of war, in May, 1846. Now Guillem was at that
time, and up to the day of his' departure, living in the city, and
must have daily seen the blockading squadron cruising off the
port, and could not pretend ignorance of the blockade. Both

in his claim and examination as a witness, he admits that he
knew of it; yet, with full knowledge of its existence, and as
if in defiance and derision of it, he embarked his property on
board. H6 was, therefore, by his own admission, guilty, and
his property is good prize. " A breach of blockade subjects
the property of all those coAcerned in it to confiscation. The
penalty attaches to all those who are privy to the fraud, by
themselves or their agents. 2 Wildman, 203. referring to the
case of the Wasser Hundt, Dodson, 27.
But it is said that this money is not good prize, because it
was not shipped as cargo. In maritime warfare, private prop.
erty taken at sea, or afloat in port, is indiscriminately liable to
capture and confiscation. Wheaton's Elements, 405.
Besides, money has been recognized by Congress as good
prize of war. 'By the eighth article of the rules and regulations
of the navy, (2 Stat. at Large, 46), it is declared: " That no
person shall take out of a prize, or vessel seized as prize, any
money, plate, goods, or any part of her rigging, unless it be for
the better preservation thereof, or absolutely necessary for the
use of any of the vessels of the United States, before the same
shall be adjudged lawful prize by a competent court; but the
whole, without fraud, concealment, or embezzlement, shall be
brought in, and judgment passed thereon, upon pain that every
person offending herein shall forfeit his share of the capture,
and suffer such further punishment as a court-martial, or the
court of admiralty in which the prize is adjudged, shall impose."
And by the ninth article it is declared: " That no person in
the navy shall strip off their clothes, or pillage, or In any manner maltreat persons taken on board a prize, on pain of such
punishment as a court-martial shall adjudge."
It has been before remarked, that Lieutenant McLaughlin
must have been misinformed as to the money being taken from
the persons of the people found on board the Jeune Nelly.
Guillem himself admits that, with the exception of the ninetyseven and a half doubloons, it was taken by the boats of the
Mississippi from the wreck to that vessel,.in buckets, the bags
-containing it having burst. As to the imputation cast upon an
offider who is not named, as to the ninety-seven and a half
doubloonsi there is not a paticle of evidence in the case to
sustain it.
2. That no permission had been given either by General
Scott or Commodore Perry, at the time Guillem left Vera
Cruz, allowing neutrals to leave that port with their property.
By the letters of General Scott and Commodore Perry-before referred to, all the permission allowed to neutrals was to,

54

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Guillem.

have intercourse with the vessels of war of their respective
countries, and even that permission was withdrawn on the 22d
of March.
General Scott, in his letter of that date to Commodore
Perry, says: "I have this moment received your note of this
date, inquiring whether, in my opinion, it may not be a necessary measure of expediency to stop, for the present, the intercourse heretofore allowed between the neutral vessels of war,
off this coast, and the city and castle of Yera Cruz." General
Scott approved of the course suggested.
Commodore -Perry, in his letters to the commanders of the
foreign vessels of war, on the same day, says:." The city and
castle of Vera Cruz being now closely besieged and blockaded
by the military and naval forces of the United States, it has
become necessary to prevent all communication from outside,
unless under a flag of truce. I am, therefore, constrained to inform you, that all inteicourse between the vessels and boats
under your command, and that part of the Mexican coast encompassed
by the United States forces, must for the present
3
cease.
General Scott, in his letter to Secretary Marcy under date
of the 25th of March, says: " That, although on the 13th of
March I had already refused to allow any persons whatever to
pass the line of investment either way, yet the blockade had
been left open to the consuls and other neutrals, to pass out to
their respective ships of war up to the 22d instant," and that
this intercourse was then stopped.
General Scott's letter to the consuls is to the same effect,
speaking only of communication between the neutrals in the
city and the ships of war of their respective nafions.
There is not one word in these letters which affords a pretence to say that neutrals were allowed to ship their property.
. This case has been presented as one of hardship. On this
subject the court said, in the case of the Joseph, 8 Cranch,
454 : "Although these considerations, if founded in truth, present a case of peculiar hardship, yet they afford no legal excuse
which it is competent to this court to admit as the basis of its
decision."

Mr, &,Soul,for the claimant, made the following points : 1st. Guillem was a native of France not naturalized, had
resided in Mexico only three yea rs, was not a merchant or
"trader, but only a cook. The, money carried by him was not
shipped as cargo, .did not appear on any manifest, and was
his necessary means of support; and was no more to be interfered with than if it had been a bill of exchange or bank-notes.

DECEMBER TERM,. 1850.

Guillem.

2d. As soon as neutrals who reside in an enemy's country
turn their back on the enemy's country, they resume their neutral character. Wheaton on Int. Law, P71, 374, 375, 378; 1
Kent's Com. 75, 77, 78.
3d. Any one has a right to embark, even in a vessel -guilty
of the violation of the blockade, as a passenger, and himself and
his personal effects are not to be interfered with. The guilt of
the vessel does not attach to the passenger and his effects. By
personial effects are meant his baggage, wearing apparel, and
other property attached to his person, in contradistinction to
goods and merchandise.
4th. The permission of General Scott to leave Vera Cruz,
and repair on board of tuitional vessels, justifies Guillem in
going on board of the Jeune Nelly , 'and his having taken his
passport to go by the British steamer in FCbruary, 1847, shows
that it was not his intention to violate the blockade; and his
embarking in the Jeune Nelly must be bonsidered as an act of
necessity and distress, there being no other means of leaving
Vera Cruz.
First Point. The nationality of Guillem is proved by his
own oath, by the testimony of Cassalet, and thlie passport of
the French qonsul; and the same evidence proves that he was
not naturalized, and that his residence had been pnly three
years. Sir William Scott lays it down that the shortest period
of time to establish a residence is four years; and 'all the authorities seem to consider that the rule of residence and identification with the enemy attaches more particularly to the commercial character, and the property captured is always spoken
of as cargo or merchandise. In the present case Guillem was
a cook; what he had with him was money, which is a personal effect. In countries where no banks exist, a man travels
with gold and silver. The most extraordinary part of this
transaction was, that Guillem had ninety-seven and a half
doubloons in his pocket; and when invited to change his
clothes, which were wet, and he was emptying his pockets for
that purpose, an American officer who had proffered him the
change of clothes laid his hand upon the money. A cook, no
more than any other person, can travel wvith a wife and children without money. The present case bears riot the slightest analogy to the 'case of Henry Rogers et al. and United
States v. The American Schooner Amado. In that case,
Rogers had resided thirteen years in Mexico, and still remained there. The cargo was taken in a vessel sailing under Mexican colors, which was owned by Rogers, who was
a merchant. His residence, the nature of the cargo, and the
circumstances under which it was captured, all stamped the.

56

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Guillem.

vessel and cargo as Mexican. It has been said by an able
writer, that truth depends upon distinction, and that law is the
science of distinction. It is impossible for a mind accustomed
to discrimination not to perceive the most manifest distinction
between the two cases.
Second Point. The second point is fully sustained by the
authorities cited; and we have only to inquire whether the
facts of the case bring Guillem within the exception laid down
in the law. Sir William Scott, in the case of the Harmony
(2 Rob. Adm. 324), says: " Time is the grand ingredient in
constituting domicile." In most cases it is unavoidably conc]usive; and -in that case that eminent person decided that
Jur years were sufficient, to fix the domicile of the party. In
the case of the Indian Chief, determined in 1800, Sir William
Scott said (Wheaton on Int. Law, 371): " Taking it to be
clear that the national character of" Mr. Johnson, as a British
merchant, was founded in residence only, that it was acquired
by residence, and rested on that circumstance alone, it must
be held that, from the moment he turned his back on the
country where he had resided, on his way to his own country,
he was in the act df resuming his original character, and must
be considered as an American. The character that is gained
by residence ceases by non-residence. It is an adventitious
character, and no longer adheres to him from the moment that
he puts himself in motion, bondfide, to quit the country, sine
animo revertendi." In the case of the Ocean, determined in
1804, Sir William Scott says (Wheaton on Int. Law, 375):
" It would, I think, be going further than the law requires, to
conclude this person by his former occupation, and by his constrained residence in France, so as not to admit him to have
taken himself out of the effect of supervening hostilities, by the
means which he had used for his removal. On sufficient proof
being made of the property, I shall be disposed to hold him
entitled to restitution." Again, in the case of the Drie Gebroeders (Wheaton on Int. Law, 375), Sir William Scott observes,
that "1retences of withdrawing funds are, at all times, to be
watched with considerable jealousy; but when the transaction
appears to have been conducted bondfide with that view, and
to be directed only to the removal of property which the accidents of war may have lodged in the belligerent country, cases
of this kind are entitled to be treated with some indulgence."
Wheaton, Int. Law, 378, says: "But this national character
which a man acquires by resiaence may be thrown off at
pleasure by a return to his native country, or even by turning
his back on the country in which he resided, on his way to another.. The reasonableness of this rule can hardly be disputed.

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

57

The United States v. Guillem.

Having once acquired a national character by residence in a
foreign country, he ought to be bound by all the consequences
of it until he has thrown it off, either by an actual return to his
native country, or to that where he was naturalized, or by
commencing his removal, bondfide, and without an intention
of returning. If any thing short of actual removal be admitted
to work a change in the national character acquired by- residence, it seems perfectly reasonable that the evidence of a bond
fide intention should be such as to leave no doubt of its sincerity." The same doctrine is recognized by Kent, as being
the rule of decision in the courts of the Uited States. See
Kent's Com. 75, 77, 78, and the authorities there cited.
Guillom comes completely within the rule. The war between Mexico and the United States broke out very unexpectedly in May or June, 1846, without formal declaration, and more
resembled the incursions of our aborigines than the usual mode
.of. making war adopted in a civilized country. Commissioners
to make peace accompanied our invading army, and no one
could realize that there was to be any permanent war between
the United States and Mexico, and proposals of peace were
expected to acbompany every despatch. It was fully expected that, when the Northern army should reach Monterey, the
war would certainly come'to a close. These circumstances
fully explain and account for the stay of Guillem from June
1846, to Februaiy, 1847. Some time might be necessary to
collect what was due to him; his term of contract might not
have expired, and the blockade itself interposed a difficulty
against leaving Vera Cruz, for it was not possible to leave
Mexico and go to a neutral country otherwise than by sea.
But as soon as it was found that the war had assumed a permanent character, that an army had been sent to invade
Mexico, Guillem resolved to leave with his wife and children,
and the result of their industry and economy, and accordingly
pxepared to embark in February in the British steamer. The
wreck of that vessel on the island of Cuba defeated his inten-'ion. His own statement and that of Cassalet of the manner
in which La Jeune Nelly entered- Vera Cruz, in open day in
fine weather, on the 13th of March, might well induce him to
believe that she had entered by permission. This was the very
day-on which, according to General Scott's despatch, he had
given permission to neutrals to withdraw. This communication had doubtless been made known to the French naval
authorities. It does not appear that La Jeune Nelly took in
cargo; and for aught we know sh might have considered herself within the permission granted by General Scott, with the
consent of Commodore Perry, to leave the blockade open to
the consuls and other neutrals, to pass out to their respective

58

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Guillem.

ships of war, up to the 22d of March. If the blockade was
left open to neutral persons to pass out, it was surely left open
for the neutral vessels which should convey them; and the
guilt of La Jeune Nelly in running the blockade, if indeed she
did run it, was purged by the permission thus given to neutrals to pass out in neutral vessels, and was the reason why
La Jeune Nelly left Vera Cruz on the 20th of March in open
day, with her colors flying and fearless of interruption. And
-this is the reason why the capture of that vessel and her shipwreck have been made cause of claim against the government
of the United States. And surely, under these circamstances,
the property of Guillem, a neutral who left Vera Cruz with the
blockade open, cannot be condemned. La Jeune Nelly was
on her way from 'Vera Cruz to Sacrificios when she was captured and wrecked; and if neutrals were permitted to go to
Sacrificios, their movements afterwards cannot be controlled.
All these circumstances should be cofistrued very favorably
towards a party so peculiarly situated.
Third Point. But admitting that La Jeune Nelly had violated the blockade, and that the permission of General Scott
and Commodore Perry to neutrals to depart did not purge the
violation, and that she was a guilty vessel, and with her cargo
was subject to condemnation, it is contended for the claimant,
that this guilt and liability to condemnation, do not in any
manner extend to a passenger and his effects. The French
crew of La Jeune Nelly could not be made prisoners of var,
nor punished in any other manner, nor could their personal
effects be confiscated; -a fortioi could not those of a passenger. The decided cases settle beyond dispute, that the person
and property of a neutral, withdrawing himself after the breaking out of war from the enemy's country, even on board of an

-not protect any enemy's property in neutral bott4m, and neutral property, if not contraband of war, is not condemned by
the character of the flag or of the bottom; and if, in place of
being gold and silver, the currency of the country and the personal effects of the neutral, Guillem had converted his property into any of the productions of Mexico, and sailed in a
Mexican vcssel with his family, and with the undoubted purpose of withdrawing himself from the Mexican dominions, his
property would not have been liable to condemnation. This

personal effects of Guillem, it is impossible to conceive how
the conclusion is ever to be arrived at, that they are subject to
condemnation because he embarked in a guilty vessel. In favor of neutrals, the laws of war are to be strictly construed. A
neutral vessel, violating a blockade, and her cargo, are to be condemned as prize of war; but was it ever heard of that the neutral individuals were made prisoners, their watches taken-from
their pockets, or their money from their purses? No such case
can be produced, and the judge would be considered as having
a fhror for condemnation, who should establish the precedent.
Whether or not gold and silver are to be considered as merchandise in regard to the laws of war, will depend on the purposes for which they are shipped. If sent for the purpose of paying a debt, or for the purpose of purchasing merchandise, they
may well be considered as cargo; but if carried by a man who
is emigrating to a foreign country or returning to his own, and
nsed as the means of taking his property along with him, they
cannot be considered as cargo. Every case of this kind must
depend on the circumstandes which surround it. Guillem leaving Mexico with his wife and children, ignorant of commerce
and not confiding in the engagements of merchants, and -perhaps unable to procure them, carried with him his small fortune, in the only shape and form of money with which he was
familiar. Is there no difference between money carried as the
personal property of the passenger, and money shipped for the
ordinary purposes of commerce? If this distinction be made,
it is impossible to understand how the three thousand dollars
of gold and silver carried by Guillem, one half of it on his person, can be condemned as the cargo of La Jeune Nelly.
Fourth Point. The statement of this point carries its own
argument with it. If the blockade was raised for the purpose
of permitting neutrals to go on board of the neutral ships of
war, it is to be supposed they would be permitted to carry their
clothes, personal effects, baggage, and money with them. We
must suppose that they could have gone to the neutral ships
of war either in cutters or other small craft of those vessels, or
in Mexican craft. It was to be supposed that General Scott
and Commodore Perry were in good faith in giving this permission, and in raising the blockade for the escape of neutrals,
and so long as neutrals took advantage of this permission in
good faith, and did not attempt to cover Mexican property, our
courts would respect and enforce the rights thus conferred.
The libel in the present case is said to be for the benefit of*the
officers and men of the vessdls of the squadron in the Gulf of
Mexico. This squadron was commanded by Commodore Perry, and neither he, his officers, nor men will be allowed to profit
by the breach of the permission thus given to neutrals to with-

draw themselves. When once on board of the neutral ships
of war, the neutrals are at liberty to go where they please;
whether the raising of the blockade extended to La Jeune
Nelly or not, is a qiiestibn which remains to be settled between
the governments; but it is presumed that the courts will compel respect to such a permission given by the commander of
the naval and land forces of the United States. In every point
of view, therefore, in which the case can be considered, it is
believed that this court will affirm the judgment of the Circuit
Court, and will decree that the costs be paid out of that part
of the property seized which was condemned.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.
There is no dispute about the material facts in this case.
The claimant was a citizen of France who had been domiciled
in Mexico about three years, following the occupation of a cook
in a hotel, and was returning with his family to reside in his
own country when the capture was made. They sailed from
Vera Cruz in a French vessel bound to Havre. The money he
bad with him, and which is now in question, was not shipped
as cargo, or for the purposes of trade. It amounted to only
two thousand eight hundred and sixty dollars; and was the
earnings of his industry in Mexico, and taken with him for the
support of himself and his family upon their return to France.
The hostile character which his domicile in Mexico had impressed upon him and his property had therefore been thrown
off; and as soon as he sailed from Vera Crui he-resumed the
character of a French !itizen, and as such was entitled to the
rights and privileges of a neutral, in regard to his property, as
well as in his person. The rights of the neutral in this respect
have always been recognized in the prize courts of England,
and were sanctioned by this court in' the case of the Venus, 8
.13ranch, 280, 281. Indeed, we do not understand that the
appellants claim to have this money condemned upon the
'ground that it was liable to be treated as the property of an
enemy, on acec6unt of the previous domicile of Guillem. But
it is insisted that, if 'it is regarded as the property of a neutral,
it was shipped in violation of the blockade; and that the charActer of the vessel in which it 'was found 'also subjects it to
condemnation.
. So. far as concerns the breach of blockadfe,
the attempt to
pass out of the port with this money was' not of itself an
offence, apart from the vessel in.which he sailed. . The blockade had been opened for the purpose of enabling consuls and
other neutrals to pas§ out to their respective ships of war, soon
after General Scott landed and invested the town. And it
continued open for that purpose until -the 22d of March. It is

true that the permission was confined to ships of war. But
the reason is obvious. They were the only vessels that could
be safely allowed to communicate with the town fhen closely
besieged. And the permission was restricted to them, because
it was believed that commanders of national vessels wpuld not
suffer a privilege granted to neutrals from motives of humanity
to be used for improper purposes.
But the object and intention of this order were evidently, not
merely to enable the neutral to avoid the hazards of the approaching bombardment, but to afford him ,an opportunity to
leave the enemy's country, and return to his own, if he desired
to do so. The neutral was not required or expected to remain
on board the ship of war. The permission opened to him a
path by which he might escape altogether from a courltry about
to be visited with the calamities of war. It therefore necessarily carried with it the permission to take'with him the
means of supporting himself and his family, on their voyage
home and after their return. The order contains no restriction
upon this subject, and to imply any would be inconsistent with
the motive by which it was evidently dictated. The Jeune
Nelly, in which the claimant embarked, sailed on the 19th of
March, while the blockade was still open for the purposes
above mentioned. It was no breach of the blockade, therefore,
for the claimant to pass out of the town at that time on his
voyage home, and to take with him the sum of money his industry had accumulated, and which was necessary for the support of himself and his family on their arrival in their own
country. The port was not then closed against the egres of
neutrals from the hostile country; nor were they forbidden to
take with them the money necessary for their support. And
if Guillem had gone on board a French ship of 'war for the
purpose of returning home, and taken with him this small sum
of money, his right to do so could not be questioned.
But it is supposed that the character of the vessel in which
he embarked subjects his property to forfeiture. La Jeune
Nelly had entered the port ii violation of the blockade; and
endeavored to break it a second time by leaving the port without permission. She was undoubtedly liable to capture and
condemnation. But it does not by any means follow, that the
property of the claimantis implicated in the guilt of the vessel, or must share in the punishment- There is no evidence to
show that he had knowledge of the previous breach of blockade, or of the intention to break it again in going out. She
was a neutral vessel belonging to his 6wn country, and had
come into the port in open day under the French flag; and
she sailed again in a manner .equally open, and without any

apparent design of concealing her movements from the blockading squadron. The permission granted by the American
commanders had as a matter of course been made public in
Vera Cruz; and Guillem must without doubt have sden citizens of neutral nations daily leaving the city for the ships of
war, and taking with them the necessary means of support for
themselves and their families. He appears to have done nothing more than avail himself of the most convenient opportunity
that offered in order to afcomplish the same object; and if he
did not participate in the design of breaking the blockade, his
property is not affected by the misconduct of the vessel in
which it was shipped. Even in the case of cargo shipped as a
mercantile adventure, and found on board of a vessel liable to
condemnation for a breach of blockade, although it is prinid
facie involved in the offence of the vessel, yet, if the owner can
show that he did not participate in the offence, his propert3 is
not liable to forfeiture. This is the rule as stated by Sir
William Scott in the case of the Alexander, 4 Rob. 93, and in
the case of the Exchange, 1 Edwards, 39, and recognized in
1 Kent's Coin. 151. And yet, in the case of a cargo shipped
for the purposes of commerce, the breach of blockade is almost
always committed by the vessel for the benefit of the cargo,
and to carry out some mercantile speculation injurious to the
rights of the belligerent nation whose ships are blockading the
port. The, case before us is a stronger one in favor of the
claimant than that of the innocent owner of a cargo. The
money in question was not shipped as cargo or as a mercantile
adventure. Guillem was a passenger on board, with his whole
family, and the money was a part of his personal effects necessary for their support and comfort. The shipment of the
money could give no aid or comfort to the enemy. And in
taking his passage in the Jeune Nelly, his intention, as far as it
can be ascertained from the testimony, was merely to return to
his own couritry, in a mode better suited to his humble circumstances and more convenient to his family, than by passing
through the ships of war. In the opinion of the court, the
money he took with him was 'not liable to condemnation on
account of the guilt of the vessel, and the decree of the Circuit
Court is therefore aifirmed.
