CLEMENTS, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V. DANIEL BE-RY.

Where the marshal of the United States had levied an execution upon certain prop.
erty under a judgment in the Circuit Court, which was taken out of his custody
by a writ of replevin issued by a State court, and the Supreme Court of the State
decided adversely to the claim of the marshal, it is within the jurisdiction of this
court to review that dision.
It is the uniform practice of the federal and State courts in Tennessee to test executions as on the first day of the term ; and as between creditors, the lien attaches
equally to all the judgments entered at the same term.
Where a judgment by default, in an action upon a promissory note, was entered
upon the 8th day of the month, but not fully entered up as to the amount due un.
til the loth, and upon the loth, a few minu:tes before the court opened, the debtor
recorded a deed of trust conveying away all his property, this deed cannot defeat
the lien of the judgment.
The judgment by default created the lien; it was a mere clerical duty to calculate
and enter up the amount due.
To note the precise time when deeds are left for record is attended with no difficult)
as between deeds; but to settle the exact comparative creation of a lien between
a recorded deed and a judgment by a court is attended with much embarras.
ment. The timepiece of the register cannot settle the validity or invalidity of a
judgment lien.
The process act of 1828, passed by Congress, refers to State laws for the creation
and effect of liens; but the preparatory steps by which they aie created depend
upon the rules adopted by the United States courts.
Tis
case was brought up from the Supreme Court of Ten.
nessee, by a writ of error issued under tie twenty-fifth section

of the Judiciary Act.
Clements, the plaintiff in error, was the' marshal of the
United*States District of Middle Tennessee.
The action was a replevin brought by Berry against Clem.

-(State court), and upon the trial in that court the following
statement of facts was agreed upon.

EWING & WHITWORTH, Attorneys for .Plaintiffs.
Upon this agreed state of facts, the Circuit Court of Davidson County were of opinion that the law was with Clements,
the defendant, and gave judgment accordingly. Berry carried
the case to the Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals of
Tennessee, where the judgment of the Circuit Court was reversed. Clements sued out a writ of error under the twentyfifth section of the Judiciary Act, and brought the case up to
this court.
It was argued by 1r. Fo-g, for the plaintiff in errgr --p4
Mr. Andrew Ewin, for the defendant in error.
1iir. Fogg, for plaintiff in error.
The act of Congress of 8th May, 1792, requires all writs and
processes, &c. to bear teste of the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, and the uniform practice in the State and Federal
courts in Tennessee is to teste the executions as of the first
day of the term from which the execution issues. Executions
are liens on personal property, and relate to their teste. When
a judgment awards an execution, what does it award? A process that bears teste from the first day of the court. In Johnson v. Ball, 1 Yerger, 291, it was decided, and is the settled
law of Tennessee, that the statute 29 Charles I. § 3, providing
that the personal property of a debtor should only be bound
from the delivery of the execution to the sheriff, is not in force
in Tennessee, but that it bound as at common law. Preston
v. Surgoine, Peck, 80. It is true that in the case of Murfree's Heirs v. Carmack, 4 Yerger, 270, it was decided that,
where a mortgage deed for land was registered on the same
day judgment was obtained, and no proof was given as to

404

SUPREME COURT.
Clements v. Berry.

the precise time of the judgment, the mortgage would take
preference of the judgment, the judgment being only a lien
from the day of its date; but at the same term of the court, in
the same~book, p. 358, the same court decided, in the case of
Porter v. Earthman, that judgments rendered upon different
days of the same term relate to the first day of the term as between creditors, although the records may show the day upon
which each was rendered. Can the statute requiring the
minutes of the court to be read every day, and to be signed by
the judge, be intended for any other purpose than to prevent
errors and mistakes, and can such statutes have any effect upon
the lien of executions and judgments in the federal court?
The same reason applies to prevent the debtor from giving a
preference by deeds of trust to other creditors, as would apply
among creditors themselves. The debtor knew a judgment by
default had been rendered against him on the 8th of March;
that it would be absolute if he did. not set it aside; and he
chose to give a preference by deed on the 10th of March. Is it
doing injustice to third persons, the creditors provided for in
that deed, to say, that the judgment and execution would
overreach that debt?
In the case of Farley v. Lea, 4 Devereux and Battle's
Law Reports, p. 169, the Supreme Court of North Carolina
decided, that judgments of a court of record, on whatever day of
the term they may be rendered, in law relate to, and are considered judgments of; the first day of the term, so that an execudwi tested on the first Monday of a court, being the 8th of
May, 1833, upon a judgment rendered on the 12th of May, 1833,
would overreach a deed of trust executed and registered on the
9th of May, 1833. Judge Gaston in his opinion says, that
this kgal relation of a judgment to the first day of the judicial
term isas perfect as was at common law the relation of an
act of Parliament to the first day of the legislative session.
The law of relation applicable to judgments has been in part
changed in that country by the statute of 29th Charles II.; but
in this State (North Carolina), and also in Tennessee, it remains
as it was at common law. He also says, that in England the
statute 29 Charles II. has provided that, against purchasers,
no writ of execution shall bind the goods, but from the time
such writ was delivered to the sherit There being no such
statute in North Carolina or Tennessee, the writ of execution
binds against all persons from the teste, as it yet does in England, where purchasers are not concerned. The teste of our
writ offierifacias,being froni the first Monday in March, 184S,
the execution overreached the deed of trust. In Coutts V.
Walker, 2 Leigh, 268, the Court of Appeals of Virginia decid-

ed that a judgment rendered on the 2d of March, 1821, the term
commencing the 21st of February preceding, overreached a
deed of trust executed on the 28th of February, and registered
the 2d of March. See 4 Comyn's Digest, Execution, D, 1, and
authorities there cited. In Wynne v. Wynnis, 1 Wilson, 39,
the reason of the rule is stated: "The general intendment of
the law is, that every judgment has relation to the first day of
the term, because the court cannot determine every suitor's
case in one day." Another reason, as stated by the judge in 2
Leigh, may have been to prevent debtors from withdrawing
their property from the effects of judgments against them, by
alienations made after it was known that, in the course of a
term, a judgment would pass.
The practice of the Circuit Courts in Tennessee is regulated
by rules which have been in force for a long period. The rule
applicable to the suit upon which the execution in this case
was founded provides, "that, if the pleadings are not filed by
the defendant on or before the first day of the term, the court
may on that day fix the time when the pleadings are to be
closed, and judgments entered." The day fixed for closing the
pleadings was the 8th of March, and judgment by default vas
then entered, and the only thing remaining to be done was to
draw that judgment out formally by the clerk, and calculate the
interest, which was not done, owing to a press of business by
the clerk, until the 10th of March, the day of the execution of
the deed of trust. It is believed that the judgment by default on
the 8th of March was not, in the words of the Supreme Court
of Tennessee, "wholly inoperative." It- might have been so,
had it not been-affirmed on the 10th of March, during the same
term ; but the entry of the last date refers to the judgment of
the 8th, is founded upon it, adopts and affirms it. It is true,
if no judgment had been entered during the same term, and
the cause had been continued, and the final judgment had
been entered at a subsequent term, there would have been
no relation to the 'Preceding term, and the execution would
then have been tested on the first day of the term, when the
final judgment was entered.
All the cases decided upon the subject of the lien of executions in Tennessee,-except two, are collected in Meigs's Digest,
title Execution, 959. Those two are the present case, and that
of the Union Bank v. MeClung, which will be reported in 9
-umphreys, p. 91, and is upon the relation of an alias execution.
The English doctrine is in 2 Tidd's Practice, 998, where he says
the fieri facias must be tested in term time, and made returnable in term time. By the law of Tennessee, and the practice
of the federal courts from their first establish'ment, all execa,

tions bear teste from the first Monday of the term from which
they purport to have been issued, and are made returnable to
the first Monday of the succeeding term. There is no difference in the form of the process from the State and federal
courts, except thoat the former are tested by the clerks, and the
latter, by the act of Congress of the 8th of May, 1792, bear teste
of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The plaintiff in error submits that the execution in the cause
which came to his hands, authorized him to levy upon chattels
belonging to the defendant on the 6th day of March, 1848, the
first day of the term, or at all events upon the personal property
that he owned on the 8th of March, when the judgment by default was obtained.
-tr.Andrew Ewing, for defendant in error.
There are two questions presented for consideration in this
court: 1st. Whether the court has jurisdiction of the cause?
2d. Which had the prior lien, the execution or the deed ?
The defendant in the State court was the marshal, and acting under the authority of the Circuit Court of the United
States in levying the execution; but this suit does not dispute
his authority or deny his right to its proper exercise; he is sued
as a trespasser, for going beyond -ven the claimed limits of his
legal power. If the property levied upon-belonged rightly to
Daniel Berry, then he was improperly exercising his power, and
this was a question of law and fact equally competent for decision in the federal or State tribunals. If the facts of the
case proved that any question was raised in the -Jtdte court in
regard to the validity of the judgment or execution under which
the marshal acted, or the legal authority of the marshal to levy
on the property of the defendant in the execution, then the
jurisdiction would have been clear in a decision against their
validity; but here the only question decided by the State court
was the title.of the property levied upon. The defendant in
error had no forumn for the ascertainment of his rights but the
State tribunal, and as he did not question the validity of the
judgment or general author"iy of the- marshal, the case does not
come within the spirit or the letter of the Judiciary Act of 1789.
2d. The question as to the priority of the liens is, under the
process act of 1828, entirely dependefit upon what may be the
law of Tennessee on this subject, and was therefore a peculiarly
fit subject for decision in the State court. It has long been
held in Tennessee,that the statute of 29 Charles II., in regard
to the lien of judgments and executions, is not in force in that
State; the lien of an execution remains, therefore, as at com-

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

401

Clements v. Berry.

mon law, subject, however, to the statutory modifications of
that lien. We find it generally stated, in the earlier common
law authorities, that the lien of an execution commenced from
its teste, and, as the whole term was regarded as one day, the
execution was tested of the first day. The general rule of law,
however, was, that fictions which were intended for the attainment of justice never should extend to work an injury. See
3 BI. Com. 48. Whenever, therefore, a fiction would woik injustice, because of its inconsiotency with the truth, courts of
law ought to look to the real facts. See 3 BI. Com. 317; 2
Burr. 962. In accordance with this rule of law, it had repeatedly been decided in England that anterior to the statute of
29 Charles II. the lien of an execution only commenced, as
against bondfide purchasers from the debtor, from the true date
of the award of the execution. See 8 Coke, 171; Cro. Eliz.
174; 2 Showers, 480; Bingham on Executions, 190. These
authorities .bave been recognized in Tennessee. See 1 Yerg.
292; 7 Yerg. 529. The awarding of an execution in England
is a judicial act, and the forms of all of our judgments in
Tennessee award an execution in pursuance of the English
practice; until the rendition of the judgment "the issuance of
an execution would be a void act, and would have no foundation on which to rest. The lien of a judgment in Tennessee
has been confined by statute to the date'of its rendition. See
Nich. & Car. 419. It would be singular, therefore, to hold that
the execution (which is the incident) had a superior lien to the
judgment, which is the principal. In accordanee with this
view, the Supreme. Court of Tennessee say, in this very case:
"Under our practice, the proceedings of the term are, contrary
to the practice of the common law, separated and distinguished
by the division of days; the record shows the day on which the
judgment is rendered, and the date thereof is indorsed upon
the execution; to the end, perhaps, that the officer, charged
with the execution of the process, might be enabled more
easily to discriminate between such alienations of property as
were valid, and those which were void as against the judgment
and execution. Inasmuch, therefore, as under our law the
precise day on which judgment is rendered is fixed and ascertained by the record, it necessarily follows, upon common law
principles, that it cannot relate beyond that' day as against
bond fide purchasers for valuable consideration; nor can the
execution issued thereon, if tested of the same term as the judgment, as against such purchaser, relate beyond the date of the
judgment; and as the hour of meeting of the court on each
day of the term, under our practice, is also ascertained by the
record, the relation of the judgment or execution cannot extend,
beyond that hour."

This investigation into the fraction of a day, for the ascertainment of truth, where there is record evidence to be obtained, is amply supported by the 'authorities. See 2 Stark.
787; 7 Com. Dig. 398; 2 B. & A. 596.
Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This case is brought here by a writ of error-to the Supreme
Court of the State of Tennessee, under the twenty-fifth section
of the Judiciary Act.
The jurisdiction of this court is the first question to be considered. The plaintiff sets up a lien on certain personal property, under a judgment rendered by the Circuit Court of the
Uiited States, held for the Middle District of Tennessee. The
defendant asserts a lien under a deed of trust for the property,
from Charles F. Berry, and the Supreme Court of Tennessee
held that the lien of the deed was paramount to that of the
judgment. This brings the case within the twenty-fifth section, as the decision was against the right asserted by Clements, under the authority of the United States.
The judgment was obtained by the firm of Inskeep, Moulton, & Woodruff, at March term, 1848, for $ 1,316.68, against
Charles F. Berry. The declaration was filed on the 1st of
March; rule for plea by the 8th of March; no plea being filed
within the rule, ajudgment-was entered'by default. On the 10th
of March "the plaintiffs appear by their attorney, and a judgment by default having been taken in this cause on the 8th of
March, 1848, and no motion having been made to have the1
same set aside, it is therefore considered by the court that said
judgment by default be affirmed," &c.
The deed of trust was received at the register's office fiftyone minutes after nine, A. AT., on the 10th of March, the same
day the deed bears date. The court, it seems, was opened on
the 10th, at ten o'clock, A. M.; so that the deed was deposited
with the register nine minutes before the court opened on that
day. The register, by law, is required to enter on a record the
exact time that an instrument is filed for record, and the lien
attaches from such entry.
Execution was issued on the judgment, tested the first Monday of March, the day at which the term commenced. 'It was
levied upon part of the goods assigned in the deed of !rust, and
those goods were replevied by Daniel Berry, the trustee, from
Clements the marshal.
It is the uniform practice of the federal and State courts of
Tennessee, to test executions as on the first day of the term;
and the lien is held equally to attach to all the judgments, as
regards creditors, entered at the same term. This rule would

not apply, perhaps, to a bondfide purchaser of real estate for a
valuable consideration, beyond the day on which the judgment
was rendered. It is admitted that the -tatute of 29 Charles
IL, as to the liens of judgments and executions, is not in force
in Termessee.; and that the lien is regulated by the common
tu, modified, to some extent, by statutes. As against a boa
fide purchaser of personal property, the lien would not attach
prior to the award of- execution. But the trustee in thig case
cannot be considered a purchaser, as the assignment was made
to him, rlot on a purchase for. a valuable consideration, but for
the benefit of certain creditors.
It would present a singular anomaly in judicial proceedings,
if the fruits of a judgment could be defeated by a-transfer of
all the property of the defendant, on the day of -its rendition;
and with the express view of avoiding the claim of the plaintiff in the judgment, by giving a preference to 'other creditors.
That such an assignment would be fraudulent, as tending to
delay and defeat creditors, is clear, but no such defence was
made in the State court.
The decision must turn upon the effect of the entries made
on the minutes of the Circuit Court. The term of the court
commenced on the 6th of March. The declaration was filed
on the 1st of March, and a rule for plea was taken in court by
the 8th. The rule of court provides, that if the pleadings
are not filed by the defendant on or before the first day of the
term, the court may on that day fix, the time when the plead.
ings are to*be closed and judgment entered.
The plea not being filed within the rule, a judgment by de-'
fault was entered. No- a judgment by default is interlociitory or final. When the action bouids in damages, at c6venant, trover, trespass, &c., it is only interlocutory, that the
plaintiff ought to recover his damages, leaving the amount of
them to be afterwards ascertained. 1 Tidd's Pr. 568. But
where the'amount of the judgment is entered by the calculation of the clerk, no further steps being necessary, by a jwuy " or
otherwise, to ascertain the amount, the judgnient is final. And
of this character was the judgment entered 'on the 8th of
March. The action was debt, brought upon several notes of
hand; the default admitted the execution of the n6tes, and the
judgment which followed was final, leaving the- clerk to make
it up in form. The affirmance of this judgment on the 10th
of March was unnecessary, as the judgment of th&- coUrt. on
the 8th concluded the mattet in controversy. It was a mere
clerical duty to make the oalculation and enter the judgment
in form; and the entry on the 10th can be considered, in.
regard to the lien in question, in effect as nothing more thain

the performance of this clerical duty, which had been authorized by the entry 6n the 8th. It was an affirmance of that
which already had been fixed, by the judgment of the court.
What remained to be done was matter of form, as it added
nothing to the legal effect of the judgment by default. Had
the defendant been called and a default entered against him,
the case would have stood for judgment at a future call of the
docket. But under the rule of the court, " the pleadings were
to be closed on the 8th and judgment. entered."
The defendant failed to plead, and a judgment by default consequently followed. The action being debt, founded upon notes
of hand, which were admitted to be genuine by the default, the
court saw that no inquiry was necessary, and the judgment
was therefore directed to be entered. That judgment was
final according to the forms of entering judgments at the common law. The omission by the clerk to make the calculation
of the amount of the judgment, and enter it in form, on the
8th of March, was supplied by the entry on the 10th. Such
entry, therefore, we think, may be considered as having relation
to the first judgment.
It is said to be a legal absurdity to suppose that the lien of
the execution can attach prior to the judgment. An execution
can be of no validity which has not a judgment to support it.
But the judgments entered on the last day of the term, by the
law of Tennessee, have relation to the first day of the term, so
as to place all the judgments entered at the term on an equality in regard to liens. This it is said is proper to do equal justice to creditors, whose judgments were necessarily entered on
different days of the term, from the arrangement of the causes
on the docket. But it is said, that a bond fide purchaser for a
valuable consideration would limit the lien of the judgment
and execution to the time the judgment was rendered. If this
be so, it is not percei"ved how the principle, can be applied to
the case before us, unless the defendant in error be considered
a bona fide purchaser. He cannot place himself in that-attitude. He holds the property in: trust for the creditors named,
having paid 'at the time no consideration for it; and having, as
rnmay be presumed from the'circumstances, a knowledge that
the assignment was made to avoid the effect of the judgment
against the assignor. It would be difficult to maintain that
this was a bonafide transaction, and especioly that it was entitled to the favorable consideration of the court. In no sense
can it be considered a bon4fide sale for a valuable consideration. The trustee is made the agent to pay the creditors
named, and he represents their interests as creditors. But if
the property had. been sold bona fide, from the effect of the

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

judgment by default, and the relation to it of the formal juidgment of affirmance subsequently entered, the lien would attach from the judgment on the 8th.
We admit that the lien of the judgment and execution in
the federal courts arises under the State laws; and that the
lien may be considered as a rule of property, and a rule of decision under the thirty-fourth section of the Judiciary Act of
1789. But the preparatory steps, by which the judgment is
obtained and the lien established, depend upon the practice of
the court; and that practice is settled by the federal courts,
and not by the courts of the State. The process act of 1828
"adopted the forms of mesne process, except the style and
forms and modes of proceeding in suits in the courts of the
United States held in those States, &c., subject, however, to
such alterations and additions as the said courts of the United
States respectively shall, in their discretion, deem expedient, or
-to such regulations as the Supreme Court shall prescribe."
The entry by the register of the precise time at which all instruments are deposited with him for record, as required by the
act of Tennessee, is no doubt a very proper regulation. It is
salutary in relation to instruments deposited for record on the
same day. 'In such cases the priority of time may be ascertained with certainty ; but when the fractions of a day
are to be compared, under such entries, to a judgment lien,
the propriety of the rule is not so apparent. The case before
us would present a point of no small, difficulty. From the entry, the trust deed appears to have 'been deposited for record
nine minutes before the court was opened. And this is to
render inoperative the lien of the judgment. Now, how is the
fact to be ascertained with certainty ? 'Where shall the exact
standard of time be found. A variation of nine or ten minutes is not uncommon in chrononieters; and the timepiece of
the register, it is supposed, could have no exclusive claim to
regulate judgment liens. Whether good or bad, it would an.
swer the purpose designed by showing the priorities of instruments left for record. But the test in regard to judgment liens
would be uncertain and unsatisfactory. As a rule of propery
it would seem to be, at least in many cases, impracticable.
How can one, five, or ten minutes be ascertained with the
requisite certainty, to lay the foundation of a right? It would
hardly be contended that the entry of a ministerial officer,
though made by authority of law, should limit or defeat a
judgment lien in such a case. No other decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee th'an the one now before us is applicable to this question. And if the case to be reviewed is to
constitute the rule for our decision'5 as insisted, the power of
revision would be useless.

SUPREME COURT.
Clements v. Berry.

Whilst we follow the construction of a State statute, established by the Supreme Court of the State, care must be taken
that our jurisdiction and practice shall not be limited or controlled by the statutes or decisions of the State, beyond the
acts of Congress.
The judgment of the State court is reversed, and the cause
is remanded to thatcourt for further proceedings in conformity
with this opinion.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY, Mr. Justice CATRON,
Mr.
Justice DANIEL, and" Mr. Justice NELSON dissented.
Mr. Justice CATRON.
By-rule of court made when only one term was held in the
year for the Districts of Tennessee, the United States Circuit
Court adopted a rule requiring a copy of the declaration to be
dent out with the writ, in all cases of suits on written agreements for the payment of money, where the plaintiff desires to
obtain judgment at the return term. If a copy of this declaration is served with the writ on the defendant thirty days before
the court commences, then the defendant is required to plead
before the, first day of the term; and if he fails to do so, it is
the-duty of the clerk to enter judgment by default at his office.
This fact he reports to the court in all cases. And then such
further time is given for.makin4 up the pleadings as may be
deemed proper by the court itself; thus extending thb titne
usually three days. But at March term, 1848, only two additional days to plead were allowed.
This office judgment has no force in itself, further than to
Apeed the final judgment. It stands over, like other causes,
triable on an issue. When it is reached on the docket in due
course, a jury inquires of damages; or if the sum be certain,
then a regular and binding judgment is entered of record by
the court.
An execution is uniformly awarded in terms by the final
judgment, and to which the execution on its face refers, by a
brief recital.
To this award of execution thefierifaciasrelates, and binds
personal property of the defendant.
The United States courts are governed by the State laws
creating a lien; and the State laws are settled by uniform adjudications that the lien attaches by a final judgment and
award of execution. From that time defendant's property is
in custody of the law. Johnson v.'Bal1, 1 Yerger, 292.

ing to the face of this record. By the law of Tennessee the
deed of trust took effect the moment it was delivered to the
register to be recorded. It was his duty by express law to indorse on the deed the exact time of delivery. After that, all
liens were cut off. This was done before the judgment was
rendered. It mattefs not whether defendant parted with his.
property on the day the judgment was rendered, or on a subsequent day, as he was divested of it the moment the trustee
delivered the deed to be recorded. If it was otherwise, and the
execution related to a judgment by default (which might remain unconfirmed for months), all executions or final judgments, where a default had been entered, would bind from the
first day of the term, and overreach sales made by retail dealers to an alarming extent; a doctrine unknown and altogether
inadmissible in the State of Tennessee, or elsewhere, so far as
I know.
The Supreme Court of Tennessee (to revise whose decision
this writ of error is prosecuted) laid down the law correctly, as
I think, in its opinion in this cause, and I am of opinion that
the judgment ought to be affirmed; And I am instructed to
say for my brother Nelson, who heard the cause but is now
absent, that this is his opinion also.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Supreme Court of the. State of Tennessee)'and

here ordered and adjudged by thi court, that the judgment
of the said Supreme Court in this cause be, and the same is
hereby, reversed, with costs, and. that this cause be, and the
same is hereby, remanded to the said Supreme Court; for fur-'
ther proceedings to be had therein, in conformity to the opinion
