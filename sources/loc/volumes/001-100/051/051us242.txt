HUGH MAXWELL, PLAniTIrF IN ERROR, v. NATHANIEL L. GRISWOLD,
GEORGE GRISWOLD, GEORGE W. GRAY, AND GEORGE GRISWOLD,

JUNIOR.
The points ruled in the preceding case of Greely v. Thompson and Forman adopted
and applied to this case also, so far as they are applicable.
Where the collector insisted upon either having the goods appraised at the value at
the time of shipment, the consequence of which would have been an addition of so
much to the invoice price as to subject the importer to a penalty; or to allow the
importer voluntarily to make the addition to tha invoice price and so escape the
penalty, and the importer chose the latter course, thi3 was not such a voluntary
payment of duties on his part as to debar him from bringing an action against the
collector for the recovery of the excess thus illegally exacted.

THIs case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Southern District of New
York.
Like the preceding case of Greely v. Thompson and Forman, it was an action brought by the defendants in error against
Maxwell, the collector at the port of New York, for the return
of duties paid under protest
In January, 1850, the defendants in error imported into New
York, in the ship Matilda, from Manilla, sundry bags of sugar
and bales of hemp. The goods were purchased in. March and
April, 1849, but not shipped until about the 24th of July, 1849,
wheri the market prices had risen very considerably. The assistant appraiser reported upon the value of the articles, meaning by the word value "the actual market value at the time of
shipment to the United States in the principal markets of the
country of produce."
The importers paid the duties under protests, one of which
was the following.

" New York, Tanuary 3d, 1850.
"H.

MTAXwELL, ESQ., Collector :

"We hereby protest against the duties demanded from us
by the collector on this importation of plantain bark, or hemp.
"One objection is, that the duties, contrary to law and justice, are assessed upon a greater value than the cost of the
same when purchased for us for shipment to the United States;
the hue costs and charges, being the value in the foreign
market (Manilla), at the time when purchased for shipment,
amount to $ 38,197.95, say thirty-eight thousand one hundollars. We are required to pay
dred and ninety-seven
duties upon an estimated and fictitious value, amounting,
with charges, &c., to $47,662.95, and we are compelled to
enter the goods at their estimated and fictitious value tosave penalties and forfeitures, and to get possession of -our
property.
" We protest against being committed to any thing by the
form of the entry, which we submit to upon compulsion, insisting that they are not according to the truths of the transactions. The sixteenth section of the tariff law of 1842 fixes
the date of purchase for shipment as the time in reference to
which the value is to be ascertained, except in the case of
goods imported into the United States from some country
other than that of the growt or manufacture of the imported
articles. There is nothing in the eighth section, or any part of
the tariff act of 1846, nor in any other law of the United States,
inconsistent with the sixteenth section of the act of 1842.
d We give notice that we intend to seek redress by suit atlaw and otherwise, as we may be advised, for the wrong done
to us in respect to the excessive duty imposed upon this importation.
" We rely upon the objection we have made, and upon such
other objections founded in law and in fact as belong to the
case, and we now offer to specify them to the collector, more
particularly if requested so to do.
"The sum of money now illegally extorted from us, over
and above the true and honest duties, is $ 2,366.25,
W. G. more or less, being 25 per ceht. on the valuation over

which it is not deemed advisable to set forth in extenso, because it contained all the invoices, entries, depositions, and circulars from the Secretary of the Treasury, the whole amounting
to nearly thirty printed pages. The following summary of
the bill will b6 sufficient.
Southern District of New York, ss.
Be it remembered, that on the 13th day of June, in the year
1850, as yet of the stated term of the said courtj commencing
on the first Monday of April, in the year 1850, held at the
'City Hall, in the city of New York, in the Southern District
of New York, before the Hon: Samuel Nels6n, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting in the
said Circuit Court the issue within contained joined between
the said Nathaniel L. Griswold, George Griswold, George W.
Gray, and George Griswold, junior, plaintiffs, and Hugh Maxwell, defendant, came on to be tried, and the said parties, by
thdir respective attorneys, before the said justice came; and the
jurors of the jury in this behalf duly summoned also came; and
to say the truth also in this behalf are elected, tried, and sworn.
I And the counsel for the said plaintiffs, to maintain and
prove the said issue in their behalf, producediand gave in evidence the invoices, entries, and protests,. in the words and figures following: (Then followed the invoices, entries, and profests, the entries
:showing that the 'appraisers had added to the amount "to
make value at time of shipment.')
And proved that said protests were made and lelivered to
the defendant at and before the payment of the duties on the
goods in said invoice and entries contained, and that the sum
of $ 12,493.50 was paid by-the plaintiffs tQ the defendants -on
the 8th day of January, 1850, as duties on the plantain bark
named in said foregoing entry thereof, of which amount
$ 2,425.50 was duty on the sum of $ 9,702, added with commissions in said entry as therein expressed, "to make market
value of bark"; and on the 15th day of the same month the
plaintiffs paid to the defendant the further sum of $ n,91, as
dutiei on the sugar named in said foregoing entry thereof, of
which amount $ 615 was duty on the sum of $ 2,050, added
with commissions in said last-mentioned entry as therein expressed, "to make value at time of shipment."
And further to maintain and prove said issue on their part,
the counsel for said plaintiffs called the following witnesses,
who, being severally duly sworn, testified as follows, that is to
say: - -(Then followed the depositions of -several -witnesses, sho-w-

ing the purchases at Manilla, and that the prices were the regular market prices at the time of purchase.)
The plaintiff's counsel, further to maintain and prove said
issue on their part, produced and gave in evidence certain circulars of the Secretary of the Treasury, in the words and
figures following, viz.: (Then followed a series of circulars from the Secretaries of
the Treasury, beginning with the year 1833, and coming down
to October, 1849, being nineteen printed pages.)
The plaintiff's counsel, further to maintain and prove said
issue on their part, called the following witnesses, who, being
severally duly sworn, testified as follows.
A. B. Mead testified that he was assistant appraiser from
about the fall of 1846 to the fall of 1849, and during that time
had the almost exclusive charge of appraising iron and other
metals, "and that, under the instructions of the Secretary of
the Treasury, the examiners and appraisers at the port of New
York have in all cases been required, under the provisions of
the tariffs of 1842 and 1846, to ascertain, and appraise, and report, the wholesale market values of all merchandise in the
principal markets of the country of production or manufacture, at the period of the exportation of the merchandise to
the United States, and not at the period of the purchase or
production of the merchandise in the country whence imported, and that such has been the uniform practice up to this
time, so far as known to the deponent."
G. F. Thompson testified that he was assistant appraiser of
the port of New York from 1844 to June, 1848, and that, under
the instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury, the examiners and appraisers at the port of New York have in all cases
been required, under the provisions of the tariffs of 1842 and
1846, to ascertain, and appraise, and report, the wholesale
market values of all merchandise in the principal markets of
the country of production or manufacture, at the period of the
exportation of the merchandise to the United States, and not
at the period of the purchase or production of the merchandise
in the country whence imported, and that such has been the
uniform practice up to this time, so far as known to the deponent.
SamueL5. Willis testified that he was one of the principal
appraisers at the port of New York from the year 1844 to July,
'1849, and that, under the instructions of the Secretary of the
Treasury, the examiners and appraisers of the port of New
York have in all cases been required, under the provisions of
the tariffs of 1842 and 1846, to ascertain, and appraise, and report, the wholesale market values of all merchandise in the
21*

Maxwell v. Griswold et al.

principal markets of the country of production or manufacture,
at the period of the exportation of the merchandise in the country whence imported, and that such has been the uniform practice up to this time, so far as known to the deponent.
The counsel for said plaintiffs then rested, and the counsel
for said defendant thereupon insisted and prayed the court to
charge and instruct the jury, as matter of law, as follows:
1. That the payment made in this case by the plaintiffs to
the defendant was a voluntary, and not a coercive payment;
and so that the plaintiffs could not maintain their action; that
the evidence showed that the collector had been entirely passive
in this whole matter, and had done no act, and made no demand, which compelled the plaintiffs to-pay the entire amount,
which they did pay upon their own advisement; that the collector merely received the sum tendered to him by the plaintiffs,'
and never made the payment a condition precedent to the delivery of the goods, nor threatened to raise the valuation expressed on the face of the invoice; all that was done was done
by the plaintiffs themselves voluntarily, without the least coercion or action on the part ( f the defendant, and that the verdict should therefore be in his favor.
2. That the acts done by the collector were all done in obedience to written instructions made by circulars addressed by
the Secretary of the Treasury to the collector (which are set out
in schedule Z, annexed to this case), and in compliance with
the acts of Congress therein referred to.
That these instructions had all the authority of law, so far as
the collector was concerned, and he could not disobey them.
That all the money received by the collector in this case was
collected by him in obedience to law, and paid immediately
into the Treasury of the United States under a like compulsion, and that the collector could not be made liable to refund
any part of this money to the plaintiffs, even although the construction put upon the revenue laws by the Secretary of the
Treasury may have been erroneous.
That the act of Congress approved February 26tb, 1845, entitled "An Act explanatory of an Act making appropriations for
the civil and diplomatic expenses of government for the year
one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine," did not apply to
this case the defendant being compelled, by laws passed by
Congress subsequently to that year, to pay over without delay
into the Treasury of the'United States all moneys received by
him as eollectorrand that by authority of the case of Carey v.
Curtiss (reported in the third of Hammond's Reports, page 236)
the defendant co Id not be made liable in this action.
3. That there was no error in the proceedings at the custom-

house, the valuation there made being the true valuation according to law, and hence this action could not be naintained.
Whereupon the court then and there charged and instructed
the jury, that by law duties were only to be assessed upon the
actual market value of the said plantain bark, or hemp, and
sugar, at the time of their purchase by the plaintiffs, and
not upon such market value at the time of their shipment
by them; and that the payment of duties by the plaintiffs
upon the increased amount, being the difference between
such market value at the time of shipment and at the time
of purchase, was, on the part of the plaintiffs, a 'payment
by coercion, and having been accompanied with the protest
the plaintiffs were entitled to a verdict for the sum paid as
duties on such increased amount, with interest thereon from
the date of its payment; that the fact that the defendant, in
taking duties upon the market value..of the merchandise at the
time of shipment, had acted in obedience to the circular instructions to that effect from the Secretary of the Treasury, did
not render such mode of assessment of duties legal, or preclude
the plaintiffs from recovering the excess paid by them above
the duties upon the market value of the merchandise at the
time of its purchase. And the court further refused to charge
or instruct the jury in conformity with the points insisted upon
by the defendant's counsel, and in conformity with which he
had prayed the court to charge and instruct the jury as aforesaid.
And the counsel for said defendant then and there excepted
to the said charge of the court, and to the refusal of the court
to charge the jury in conformity with which the said counsel
had so prayed the court to charge the jury, as aforesaid.
And thereupon the jurors of the jury aforesaid found a verdict for the plaintiffs for three thousand two hundred and six
dollars and forty-four cents.
And because the said several matters so offered and given in
evidence, and the matters insisted upon by the said defendant,
and the decision of the said court, and the charge of the said
court, and the said exceptions taken to the same, do not appear
by the record of the verdict aforesaid, the said defendant has
caused the same to be written on this bill of exceptions, to be
annexed to said record, and has prayed-the said justice, holding
the said 'ourt, to set his hand and seal to the same. Whereupon the said.the hoftorable Samuel Nelson, the associate Justice before whom the said issue was tried, an-d the said exceptions were taken, has hereto set his hand and seal, this 2d
day of January, in the year 1851.

SUPREME COURT.
Maxwell v. Griswold et al.

Upou this bill of exception, the case came up to this court.
It was argued by Mr. Crittenden (Attorney-General), for the
plaintiff in error, and M~r. . S. .fc Culloh, for the defendants in
error.
For 111r. Crittenden's argument, see the preceding case of
Greely v. Thompson and Forman.

Mr. Mc Gulloh made the following points: I. The duties were exacted by coercion and duress, and
were not a voluntary payment without condition or reserve.
II. The right to maintain this action under the act of 26th
February, 1845, is not imnpaired or taken away by laws or circulars of a date prior or subsequent thereto.
III. The dutiable value of the merdhandise was illegally estimated and appraised by the appraisers and collector, at the
market prices of the period of shipmeit, and their'acts, being
illegal thereon, are not conclusive on the importer, but are null
and void.
1. The payment was coercive and by duress, and not voluntaiy and without reserve.
The sovereignty of the United States has, as its incident, the
power to prohibit imports and lay impost duties, and in the
exercise thereof has appointed officers to execute its regulations.
Boarding officers are to search and seal boxes, &c. Act of
1799, c. 22, § 97. Mlasters and mates are fined $ 1000 for allovwing merchandise to be landed without permit and in open day
(179, c. 22, § 27), and merchandise so landed is forfeited (1799,
c. 22, §§ 27, 50).
The collector and naval officers are to estimate the duties in
gross, and indorse the amount on entry (1799, c. 22, § 21, 49),
and no permit to land is granted until this amount is paid
(799, c. 22, § 62), and a bond for redelivery of the merchahdise on demand of the collector is executed according, to the
act of. 1830, c. 147, 6 8 (4 Stat. at Large, 411.)
The entry; which is to be made before the goods are landed
(1799, c. 22, §§ 21, 27, &c.), is to be sworn to by the importer,
and on it he has to make the additions, which, by § 8 of the
tariff act of 1846, are authorized in the cases of purchased
goods; and if the additions are not then made, the Secretary
of the Treasury refuses to relieve under the act of 1797, March
3d, from any penalty that may be inflicted where the appraisers
put up the value (see Circular of Secretary of the Treasury,
11th June, 1849), and in remitting the penalty, only the half of
the United States would be returned, if the residue shall have

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

249

Maxwell v. Griswold et al.
been distributed among the officers of the customs (Circular,
25th May, 1845).
The Circular of 6th July, 1847, had expressly directed all appraisements to be based on the market values at time of shipment, instead of the time of purchase, and under this and the
subsequent circulars the importer's would inevitably have suffered the penalty, had they not raised their invoice-purchase
prices to the market values of shipment.
Upon suspicion by the collector of intended fraud in stating
the value, or otherwise, the importer is liable, after entry, to
have the goods seized (Act of 1842, c. 270, § 21, 5 Stat. at
Large, 565; 1799, e. 22, §§ 66, 67; Rankin v. Hoyt, 4 Howard, 333) ; and if the importer succeeds in establishing his
good faith, he still cannot recover from the United States the
costs expended by him.
See 3 Howard, 252, opinion of
Justice Story; Shaw v. Woodcock, 7 Barn. & Cres. 73, 84;
Irving v.Wrilsohi, 4 T. R. 485; Snowdon v. Davis, 1 Taunt.
;358.
2. The right to maintain this action, under the act of 26th
February, 1845, c. 22 (5 Stat. at Large, 729), is not impaired or taken h-waay by laws and circulars of a date prior or
subsequent thereto.
The power given to the Secretary of the Treasury, under
§§ 23, 24 of the tariff act of 1842, to establish "regulations not
inconsistent with the laws of the United States," to secure
just and impartial appraisals of goods, is a special and very
guarded power, and is but a repetition of former similar provisions. Act of 1832, c. 227, § 9 (4 Stat. at Large, 592).
The collector who exacts duties under instructions inconsistent with the law, cannot plead in defence an act of a superior,
which in itself is null and void. See Opinions of AttorneysGeneral, 1015.
The personal inconvenience of the collector is not to be considered. Tracey v. Swartwout, 10 Peters, 98.
The act of 1839, March 3d, § 2, was in effect but the reiteration of former provisions of law (1799, c. 22, § 21, 1 Stat. at
Large, 644) ; nor is there any act gubsequent to 1839 that overrules the act of February 26th, 1845.
The second clause of the act of 26th February, 1845, provides for the maintaining of actionsq snd trials by jury for subsequent extortions, and any enactment to repeal this provision
must be wholly repugnant to and inconsistent with it, or the
two taws must consit together as part of an entire system;
and the courts will jealously restrict the construction of laws
exempting officers from responsibility for oppression in the exercise of powers which tend to produce fines and penalties

(Jones v. Estis, 2 Johns. 379), which derogate from the common
law (19 Vin. Abr. 524, § 125; 4 Hill, 76, 92), which derogate
from the rights of. property (Smith v. Spooner, 3 Pick. 2;30),
and the illegal exercise of which has always been held to subject officers to rec6mpense the damages arising therefrom. The
Mariana Flora, 11 Wheat. 1; Ripley v. Gelston, 9 Johns. 302;
Gossly v. Barlow, 1 Anstruther, 23; Bostock v. Saunders, 2
-Black. 912.
It is to be observed that this exaction is made under the
general regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury,
under § 23 of the tariff act of 1842, and not by a special decision, under the twenty-fourth section of said oct.
3. In support of the point that the appraisement on the market value of shipment was illegal, and the acts of the officers
based thereon were nullities, the following authorities are relied
upon.
Under the revenue laws pasued prior to 1823, the assessment
of merchandise subjcct to ad valorern duties was based on its
"actual cost, in labok and materials," and .not on its actual
market value. Ninety-five Bales v. United States, 1 Paine's
C. C. 149; 1789, c. 5, § 22 (1 Stat. at Large, 42);- Tappan v.
United States, 2 Mason's C. C. R. 402; 1790, c. 35, § 46 (Ibid.
169); Tappan v. United States, 11 Wheat. 419 ; 1799, c. 22'
466 (Ibid. 677) ; Act of 1818, 0.792 §79 (3 Stat. at Large, 435.)
By the subsequent laws the a&sessment was based on the
actual wholesale market value of the'goods. Acts of 1823, c.
21, §§ 4, 52 8, 13, 15 (3 Stat. at Large, 732, 733,. 734, 735);
1828, c. 55, § 8 (4 Stat. at Large, 273) ;-1830, c. 147, § 4 (Ibid.
•410) ; 1832, c. 227, § 7. (Ibid. 591) ;.1842, c. 270, § 16 (5 Stat.
at Large,. 503).
By the acts of 1823, c. 21, §§ 5, 13, 16 (3 Stat. at Large, 733,
735), and 1842, c. 270, §§ 16, 17 (5'Stat.' at Large, 563, 564),
the actual wholesale market values, in the chief markets of the
country of production, are to-be estimated and ascertained at
the time of the purchase of the goods, except that, in case the
importation is from a country other than that of the original
production, then the values are to be found as of the time of
the exportation to the United States; and by the act of 1846,
c. 74, § 8 (Pamphlet Laws, 69), the rules prescribed by then
existing laws are regnacted in regard to merchandise subsequently imported.
The value so to be ascertained is the " n et," " prime,"
"wholesale price," after deduction of discounts, bounties, and
drawbacks ; Act of 1823, c. 21, §§ 5, 16-(3 Stat. at Large, 732,
735); Act of 1842, c. 270, § 16 (5 Stat. at Large, 563); and
after allowance for-" depreciation" in the "foreign moneys" in

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

251

Maxwell v. Griswold et al.

which these values are required to be expressed. Act of 1799,
c. 22, §336, 61 (1 Stat. at Large, 655, 673) ; Act of 1789, c. 5,
§ 13 (1 Stat. at Large, 39) ; Act of 1801, c. 28, § 2 (2 Stat. at
Large, 121).
The argument of the plaintiffs in error is,, that the "proviso"
of § 16 of the tariff act of 1842 (5 Stat. at Large, 563) overrules or repeals the body, of that section, as to the time of ascertaining the market values. (See Treasury Circular of 6th
July,. 1847.)
But this view has not been maintained even by the Treasury
Department, (see Cir. 9th September, 1846,) and that it is erroneous is evident, because the proviso contemplates an importation from "a country other than that of production," whilst
the purview of the section refers to an importation "from the
country of original production."
The general object of a "proviso" is to qualify or restrain
the generality of the "purview" of an act. Minis v. United
States, 15 Peters, 445. And where the "proviso" may operat
as a separate and substantive clause in itself, differently from
the rest of the enactment, it must be so construed. Rex v.
Harris, 4 T. R. 202; Rex zy.Robinson, 2 Burr. 799; The
Emily & Caroline, 9 Wheaton, 381.
In Churchill v. Crane, 2 M. & P. 415, it was held that where
a general intent is expressed, and then a special intent, the last
i an exception.
To repeal the "body" of an enactment by the "proviso"
requires that it be wholly repugnant to the "p arview." I Kent
Cum. 462. The substitution of one enactment for another must
be entire and repugnant, in order to repeal by implication. See
United States v. Heth, 3 Craneh, 399; Goodenow v. Butterick,
7 Mass. 141. And clauses that are repugnant to a law and the
system are held to be null in order to sustain the general provisions. Mendon v. County of Worcester, 10 Pick. 235.
It has been adjudged by the Cirduit Court of the United
States for Massachusetts, in the case of Thompson and Forman v. Greely, decided in October, 1850, that by the acts of
1823, c. 21, §§ 5, 8, 13, 16, and 1842, c. 270, § 16, the appraisement of merchandise is to be made "if .actually bQught as of
the time of purchase,,and if imported for account of the pro.
ducer or manufacturer, at the time when manufactured or produced." So held in Grinnell v. Lawrence, Ct. Ct. U. S. New
York. The estimation and appraisal, therefore, to be final and
conclusive on the importer, must have been made in strict
compliance with the requirements of law.
In Rankin v. Hoyt, 4 How. 327, which, was a case of suspicion of fraud, the 'court say that the appraisers are a sort of

SUPREME COURT.
Maxwell v. Griswold et a].

legal referees under the act of 1830, c. 147, § 8, and are to be
presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have
done their duty. But it is to be observed that the execution
of a special power is not final and conclusive, whoever the actor may be, unless the requirements of law be accurately fulfilled.
The exercise of a delegated discretion cannot exceed the
power given (Schell v. Bridgewater Manuf. Co., 24 Pick. 296),
although the burden of showing this excess or departure from
the trust delegated is thrown on the importer (see Tappan
v. United States, 2 Mason, 406, 407; 11 Wheaton, 419), the
presumption of law being in favor of the validity of acts done
until impeached. Rankin v. Hoyt, 4 Howard, 327.
By an appraisement as of the time of shipment, no other
future steps can remedy the illegality, and the provisions of
17 of the tariff act of 1842 (5 S at. at Large, 574) do not
mnake any appraisement final 4nd conclusive, unless the mer-hant neglects or refuses to furnish proof or answer interrogatories, or unless the collector having by writing notice of the
dissatisfaction of the importer, has a merchant appraisement
conformably to law. Such steps were taken by the collector
in the cases reported in 2 Mason, and 4 Howard, 327.
The fluctuation of the markets in foreign countries makes the
period when the value is estimated a matter of substance, and
is of far more importance than the non-compliance with requirements of form alone, which have been adjudged sufficient to
destroy the validity of 'acts, and subject the actors to damages
in suits at law when executing specially delegated powers or
summary proceedings, the performance of which must be
strictly carried out, because they tend to produce fines and
penaLes, to derogate from the common law, and from the
rights of property, and to appropriate private property to public
use, which, being- contrary to natural right and justice, is only
tolerated in cases of necessity, and upon full compensation.

Court of N. Y., Sept. 1850).
The power of the collector to make appraisements of foreign
merchandise is a summary and special power, and it was extended from time to time, to apply to other and additional instances, until finally it was made applicable to all cases.
It was originally applied to cases of imports without an invoice; Acts of 1789, c. 5, § 16 (1 Stat. at Large, 41); 1790, c. 35,
§ 37 (Ibid. 166); 1799, c. 22, §§ 52, 66 (Ibid. 665, 671); to imports suspected to be fr-audulent, or invoiced in fraud; Acts of
1789, c. 5, § 22 (1 Stat. at Large, 42); 1790, c. 35, § 66 (Ibid
175); 1799, c. 22, §§ 66,67 (Ibid. 677); to goods damaged on the
voyage of importation; Acts of 1789, c. 5, § 16 (1 Stat. at Large,
41); 1790, c. 35, § 37 (Ibid. 166); 1799, c. 22, § 52 (Ibid. 665).
These appraisements were made by two merchants, one
chosen by the collector, the other by the importer; but afterwards, by the acts of 1818, c. 79, § 9 (3 Stat. at Large, 435),
and 1823, c.21, § 16 (Ibid. 705), the President was to appoint
persons who should, "whenever directed by the collector," make
the appraisements "he required."
By the acts of 1818, c. 79, § 11 (3 Stat. at Large, 436), and
1823, c.21, §§ 13, 12, 15 (Ibid. 734, 735), penalties were imposed on "goods suspected to be fraudulently invoiced, and
raised by the appraisers."
By the act of 1828, c. 55, § 9 (4 Stat. at Large, 274), ,all
goods were directed to be appraised, and by the acts of 1830,
c. 147, § 3 (4 Stat. at Large, 409), 1832, c. 227, § 7 (Ibid. 591),
1842, c. 270, § 16 (5 Stat. at Large, 563), all goods were to be
appraised by the collector.
The power to review appraisements was, under the act of
1823, c. 21, §§ 18, 19, 21 '(3 Stat. at Large, 736), by two merchants acting with the two United States appraisers; under act
cf 1818, c. 79, § 9 (3 Stat. at Large, 435), by two United States
appraisers and one appointed by the importer; under acts of
1832, c. 227, § 8 (4 Stat at Large, 592), and 1830, c. 147, § 3
(Ibid. 409), by one appraiser appointed by the collector, and

one by the importer, who was to make oath as prescribed, &c.
rankin v. Hoyt, 4 How. 327. And under the act of 1842,
c. 270, § 17, by two merchant appraisers appointed by the collector.
The act of 1842 thus repeals the provision of 1830 and
1832, by prescribing a different mode of revision.
Giving power to one person expressly to.do a thing, excludes
all others. Lyon v. jerome, 26 Wend. 485. And substituting
provisions o4 the same subject, is a virtual repeal of the former
provisions. United States v. Heth,' 2 Cranch, 399; Gage v.
Currier, 4 Pick. 399; Davis v. P.airburn, 3 How. 636.
.In addition to these enactments, there are others which answer any argument founded on supposed necessity to make the
time of shipment the period of valuation of the merchandise.
The importer must produce a sworn invoice of cost; Act of
1823, c. 21, § 4 (3 Stat. at Large, 731); and must enter by it;
Act of 1799, c. 22, § 36 (1 Stat. at Large, 655). The Secretary
of the Treasury can "require testimony" in such manner as he
deems proper; Act of 1823, c. 21, § 18 (3 Stat. at Large, 736) ;
"can establish rules to secure fair, impartial appraisals" ; Acts
of 1832, c. 227, § 9 (4 Stat. at Large, 592), and 1842, c. 270,
§ 23 (5 Stat. at Large, 566); can require a bond from the importer, to produce, in a specified time, such proof as the Secretary of the Treasury may demand. Act of 1830, c. 147, § 8 (4
Stat. at Large, 411).
There is therefore no reason, under the. present revenue
laws, for turning the power of appraisal into an engine of
oppressive extortion against American merchants engaged in
foreign commerce, whose transactions are open to the world.
Mr. Justice WOODBURY delivered the opinion of the court.
This'case presents two points, similar to what have just been
decided in Greely v. Thompson et al. In respect to the first
one, which related to the proper time for fixing the value of
goods imported from -the country of their growth or manufacture, this court there held it was the time of their procurement
when not purchased, and the time of their purchase when they
had'been actually purchased abroad, rather than the time of
their exportation or shipment. The goods in this case were
valued at the latter time, though they had been previously
purchased, and at.a lower price. For the reasons assigned in
the other case, the instruction given that this time was wrong,
must be considered legal.
Another point decided in Qreely v. Thompson et al, and
which is a ground of exception here, was, that though the
.money was collected in ob6edience to orders frqm the Treasury

Maxwell v. Griswold et al.

Department, which the collector, so far as regards the Departrnent, was bound to follow, yet this did not justify him as to
others, or bar a recovery by third persons if not liable in law to
pay so high duties. For the reasons there assigned,-this exception is likewise one which cannot be sustained.
The other points in that case do not arise here,-but one does
arise which did not exist there, and which w'e now proceed to
examine.
The importer had put in his invoice the price actually paid
for the goods, with charges, and proposed to enter them at the
value thus fixed. But the collector concluded in that event to
have them appraised, and the value would then, by instructions
and usage at New York, be ascertained as at the time of the
shipment, which was considerably higher, and would probably
subject the importer, not only to pay more duties, but to suffer
a penalty.
The importer protested against this, but-in order to avoid
the penalty, under such a wrong appraisal, adopted the following course.
This being a case of purchase of goods abroad; and not procurement, it came clearly within the eighth section of the act
of 1846, and therefore the importer, as that act permits, was
allowed to make, and did make, an addition to his invoice, so
as to escape the penalty, by means" of the addition, and the
payment of the consequent increased duties. (Pamphlet Laws
or 18-46, p. 69.)
This increase of duties, thus obtained, the present action is
instituted to recover back, they having been paid under protest
and unwillingly. The government, however, insist that this
excess of duties was caused and paid voluntarily, and hence,
though illegal, cannot be recovered back. If they were paid
-voluntarily, some precedents would seem to countenance the
inability to sustain this suit. Elliot v. Swartwout, 10 Peters,
137.
But the gist of the point is, were these increased duties in
truth paid voluntarily, in the meaning of that term as applicable to the present subject? We have already seen, that the
importer did not at first propose to enter his goods of such a
value as; to justiry these increased duties. On the contrary, he
insisted on entering them at only the price for which he purchased them, withchalges, and thus agreeing with his original
invoice, while the collector virtually insisted on having them
appraised at their increased value as at the time of the shipment, such being the usage in.the custom-house at New York,'
and such the requirement of the circular of the Secretary of the
Trbasury, November 24th, 1846. The importer, knowing that.

COURT.

this would subject him to a severe penalty, in order to avoid it,
felt 'ompelled to add to his invoice the amount which the price
had risen between the purchase and the shipment.
But this addition and consequent payment of the higher
duties were so far from voluntary in him, that he accompanied
them with remonstrances against being thus coerced to do the
act in order to escape a greater evil, and accompanied the payment with a protest against the legality of the course pursued
towards him.
Now, it can hardly be meant in this class of cases, that, to
make a payment involuntary, it should be by actual violence,
or any physical duress. It suffices, if,'the payment is caused
on the one part by an illegal demand, and made on the other
part reluctantly and in consequence of that illegality, and without being able to regain possession of his property except by
submitting to the payment. (See cases cited hereafter.)
All these requisites existed here. We have already decided,
that the demand for such an increased appraisal was illegal.
The appraisal itself, as made, was illegal. The raising of the
invoice was thus caused by these illegalities in order to escape
a greater burden in the penalty. The payment of the increased
duties thus caused was wrongfully imposed on the importer,
and was submitted to merely as a choice of evils.
He was unwilling to pay either the excess of duties or the
penalty, and must be considered, therefore, as forced into one
or the other by the collector, colore offcii, through the invalid
and illegal course pursued in having the appraisal made of the
value at-the wrong period, however well meant may have been
the views of the collector.
The money was thus obtained by a moral duress, not justified by law, and which was not submitted to by the importer,
except to regain possession of his property withheld from him
on grounds manifestly wrong. Indeed, it seems sufficient to
sustain the action, whether under the act of February 26th,
1845, or under principles of the common law, if the duties
exacted were not legal, and were demanded and were paid
under protest. 5 Stat. at Large, 727; Clinton v. Strong, 9
Johns. 370; .11 Wheaton; 1 Miller, 536; 1 Bos. & Pul. 139;
Irving v. Chitsowdt, 4 D. & E. 485,'553: Cowp. 69, 805.
All these circumstances existed here, and henec the judgment below mast be affirmed.

JAMES

B.

GILIER, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, v. GEORGE POINDEXTER.

On the 30th of January, 1835, Poindexter purchased from Thomas a right of entry
in certain lands in Louisiana, with authority to locate the lands in the name of
Thomas, and they were so located. Subsequently to such location, viz. on the
27th of November, 1840, Thomas, by notarial act, transferred to Poindexter all
the right which Thomas then had, or thereafter might have, to the land so located,

and authorized Poindexter to obtain a patent in his own name. The patent,.however, was issued to Thomas, and not to Poindexter. This did not vest in Poindexter
a kgal title, which would enable him to recover in a petitory action, which corresponds with an action Af ejectment. Poindexter did not take a legal title, either by
direct conveyance or by estoppel.
On the 20th ot November, 1835, Poindexter, by a conveyance of record, conveyed
his right in the lands in question to Huston, and on the same day, by articles of copartnershipwith Huston, not of record, uthorized Huston to apply these lands for
the mutual benefit of Poindexter and Huston.

A purchaser from Huston without notice is not affected by these articles.

THis case was brought up, by ,Nvrit of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana.
On the 30th of June, 1834, Congress passed an "Act granting to General Philemon Thomas, of Louisiana, a tract of land,
in consideration of the military services rendered by him in
taking possession of that portion of West Florida included in
the District of Baton Rouge." By this act, Thomas was authorized to enter, without payment, two sections of land on any
of the lands of the United States in the State of Louisiana.
On the 30th of January, 1835, Thomas executed a deed to
George Poindexter, in which, for the consideration of $ 7,500,
he "granted, bargained, and sold unto him, the said George
Poindexter, his heirs and assigns, for ever, all the right, title,
interest, and claim whatsoever, which lie, the said Philemon
Thomas, may have, or might hereafter have, in and by virtue
of the recited act of Congress; and the said Philemon Thomas
doth hereby authorize and empower the said George Poindexter to make the location or locations of the said twelve hundred
and eighty acres of land for his own proper use and benefit, or
proper use and benefit of his heirs or assigns, in the same manner, and with the same effect, as he, the said Philemon Thomas,
might have done in his own name if this conveyance had not
been made."
