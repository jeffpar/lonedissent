SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Brooks et al.

THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR, V. JEHIEL BROOKS AND
OTHERs, DEFENDANTS.
A supplementary article to a treaty between the United States and the Caddo Indians, providing that certain persons "shall have their right to the said four leagucs
of land reserved for them and their heirs and assigns for ever. The said lands to
be taken out of the lands ceded to the United States by the said Caddo nation of
Indians, as expressed in the treaty to which these articles are supplementary. And
the four leagues of land shall be laid off," &c., - gave to the reservees a fee simple to all the rights which the Caddoes had in those lands, as fully as any patent
from the government could make one. Nothing further was contemplated by the
treaty to perfect the title.

THIS case was brought up, by writ of eryor, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana.
The facts are very fully set forth in the opinion of the court,
to which the reader is referred.
It was argued by Mr. Crittenden (Attornay-General), for the
United States, and Mr. Walker, for the defendants.
.Mr. Crittendenz made the following points: I. That the first supplementary article of the treaty does not
make a grant or reservation in favor of the Grappes of four
leagues of land, but the true meaning and import is simply
that the Grappes shall have their right, whatever it may be, to
the four leagues of land stated as being reserved to them in
1801, in the preamble-; and there was, therefore, error in the
refusal of the court to give the first instruction prayed for.
This, it is corntended, is the true construction. The language
of the second supplementary article, relating to the donation to
Edwards, is very different in its terms, and imports a present
grant. "There shall be reserved to Larkin Edwards, &c., one
section of land."
IL That the recital of the reservation to the Grappes, in
1801 does not relieve the defendants from producing the primordial title on which they must rely, and the court, therefore,
erred in refusing to give the F":cond instruction prayed for, and
in charging as it did on this point under the second head of the
charge as given.
The law of Louisiana, borrowed froth the civil law, is
against the court below. The 2251st article of the Code declares that "recognitive acts do not dispense with the exhibition of the primordial title, unless its tenor be there specially
set forth." In this case its .tenor is not set forth, and the primordial title must therefore be produced. The recognitive act
is no proof of the contents of the primordial, even when the
latter is fully set forth, unless it also be shown that the latter

is lost. 1 Evans's Pothier, §§ 742,743, p. 44 3 ; Brooks v. Norris,
6 Rob. 181.
But had the Spanish authorities in 1801 any power to au.
thorize and sanction the reservation? That they had no such
power has been decided many times in this court, in-the case
of the Perdido boundary. The country embraced within the
limits of Louisiana, west of the M\lississippi, stretched far beond even the Sabine, and it was not until the treaty with
Spain of 1819, that the .United States relinquished their claim
to it, and ceded what lay west of that river to Spain. The
United States claimed it from the first. In the act of 20th
February, 1811 (2 Stat. at Large, 641), to authorize the people
of the Territory of Orleans to form a State government, the Sabine is declared to be the western boundary of the new State.
Besides, it is to be remembered, that the fourteenth section of
the act of 26th March, 1804 (2 Stat. at Large, 287), declares
that all grants, and every act and proceeding subsequent to
the treaty of St. Ildefonso, of whatsoever nature, towards thd
obtaining of any grant, title, or claim to land in Louisiana,
under whatsoever authority transacted or presented i shall be
null and void.
In addition to all this, it may here be mentioned that the
Caddoes themselves never claimed Rush Island, or ever used it
in any way. It was occupied by whites, and was never intended by the Caddoes to be included in the teaty or given
to ,the Grappes.
III. That by the law of Spain-the Caddo Indians had no
primitive title to any land, and had no power to alienate without consent of the Spanish authorities; and these authorities
at Natchitoches had no right to sanction the donation mentioned in the preamble and supplementary article. Mitchel
et al. v. The United States, 9 Pet. 714. The Spanish officers
at Natchitoches had no control over the Caddoes, the territory
they inhabited being within the jurisdiction of the post of Nacogdoches. See 2 Martin's History of Louisiana, 20.2,203,261,
262; see also House Doe. No. 49, 1st Session, 24th Congress.
IV. That there was error in the court refusing to give the
fourth instruction prayed for, because the matters therein mentionedLwere part of the history and public archives of the
country, on which it was the duty of the court to inform the
jury: See the state papers above referred to.
• V. That the court erred in refusing to give the fifth instruction prayed for, and in charging as in the third point of the
charge given.
VI. That if there is no title in Brooks, there can be none in
the purchasers under him

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Brooks et al.

VII. That the court erred in not admitting as evidence in the
cause the letter of General Cass to Mr. Garland, of the 17th.of
March, 1836, and the memorial of the Caddoes to the Senate
of the United States, of the 19th of September, 1837, and the
report of the House and depositions therein, and in the case
of Brooks v. Norris; and in admitting copies of the affidavits
of David, Trichel, and D'Ortlont.
11ir. Walker's points were as follows:1. Defendants' title rests upon a grant by treaty to the
Grappes, a bondfide sale by them to Jehiel Brooks, and a bond
fide sale of part of the land by him to the other d( fendarits.
, The treaty of 1st July, 1835, being ratified and con irmed by
the President and Senate, becomes the supreme la-,, and cannot be set aside by the courts, on any ground whatever, not
even upon an allegation of fraud. Const. U. S., art. 6, § 2;

Nos. 1, 4, 6,8,11, and 12; 1 Kent, 286,287; 6 Cranch, 136, 139.
2. The boundaries of the Indian lands ceded to the United
States by the treaty are fixed therein, and cannot now be disputed by either party thereto, nor can they be altered but by
the consent of both parties; the right -of the Indians to the
lands ceded is admitted by the treaty, and by the general
policy of the government in treating with them. Story on

in writing, and cannot be varied or contradicted by them.

cannot be varied or contradicted by parol proof. 2 Peters's Digest, 153, No. 35; 161, No. 128; 172, No. 238.
4. The treaty, by its terms, declared that the Caddo Indians
had previously donated the lands in dispute to the Grappes,
the defendants' vendors, and confirmed that donation to them;
which treaty having.the force of a law, it is equal in dignity
and effect to a complete ,-ant by the United States, and they
cannot go beyond that grankt. 9 Pet. 746; Johnson v. McIntosh, 8 Wheat. 571; 6 Peters, 342;.2 Howard, 344.
5. The motives that induced the President and Senate to
ratify the treaty containing this grant, or the reasons, if any,
that should have influenced them to reject that part of the
-treaty, are not proper subjeets of inquiry in any court, but all

such acts must be received as conclusive on all subjects within
the scope of their power. 6 Cranch, 129, 131; Story on Const.
567.
6. Congress cannot, by legislation in any form, divest a citizen of rights acquired under a treaty, or previous act of Congress. 6 Cranch, 132, 133, 135.
7. Brooks is a bond fide purchaser from the Grappes, who
acquired a good legal title under the treaty, which title cannot
be questioned by the grantors of his vendors. 6 Cranch, 133,
134; Story on Const. 567.
8. Fraud cannot be charged on Brooks, as United States
commissioner, in negotiating the treaty, without charging the
same on the President and Senate, for he was their agent, and
they made his act their own by their confirmation of the treaty.
Story on Const. 557.
9. Congress have not authorized the inquiry of fraud to be
made, but expunged it from the House resolutions, 38. Resolution of Congress, 30th August; 1842 (5 Stat. at Large,
584).
10. The fact of Brooks having been commissioner to negotiate the treaty did not disqualify him from purchasing long
afterwards, and when his functions had ceased, land reserved
in said treaty, and such purchase is no evidence of fraud in
negotiating the treaty. 2 Peters's Digest, 357; 3 Wash. C. C.
R. 556 et seq.
11. The question of fraud was, however, submitted by the
court to the jury, and decided in favor of the defendants, as
appears by the record.
12. Report of commissioners, Doe. 1035, and record of Brooks
v. Norris, not admissible. 1st. The depositions not taken in
any suit nor in any issue joined before any judicial tribunal,
nor any other tribunal having power to try or decide title to
property. 1 Phil. Ev. 14 (and note 42), 378, 394, and 395;

Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
This is another chapter in our dealings with Indians, and it
illustrates our character and theirs in such transactions. The
case will be better understood from its history, than by the
discussion of points which it suggests. After the narrative,

SUPREME COURT.

446

The United States v. Brooks et al.

The case is brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana.
It was a petition filed by the United States in consequence
of the passage of the following joint resolution of both houses
of Congress, on the 30th of August, 1842:" Resolved, &c.,'That the District Attorney of the United
States for the Western District of Louisiana be, and is hereby,
directed to institute such legal proceedings in the proper court
as may be necessary to vindicate the right of the United
States to Rush Island, which is alleged to have been improperly included in the limits of the lands ceded by the Caddo
Indians to the United States, by the treaty of the 1st July,
1835, and reserved by said treaty in favor of certain persons
by the name of Grappe2' (5 Stat. at Large, 584).
The facts in the case were these.
On the 28th of January, 1835, the President of the United
States received the following letter from the Caddo Indians: To his Excellency the President of the United States.
" The memorial of the undersigned, chiefs and head men of
the Caddo nation of Indians, humbly represents : "That they are now the same nation of people they were,
and inhabit the same country and villages they did, when first
invited to hold council with their new brothers, the Americans,
thirty years (sixty Caddo years) ago; and our traditions inform
us that our villages have been established where they now
stand ever since the first Caddo was created, before the Americans owned Louisiana. The French, and afterwards the Spaniards, always treated us as friends and brothers. No white
man ever settled on our lands, and we were assured they never
should. We were told the same things by the Americans in
our first council at Natchitoches, and that we could not sell
our lands to any body but our great father the President. Our
two last agents, Captain Grey and Colonel Brooks, have driven
a great many bad white people off from our lands; but nrw
"

our last-named agent tells us that he is no longer our agent,
and that we no longer have a gunsmith or blacksmith, and
says he does not know what will be done with us or for us.
"This heavy news has put us in great trouble. We have
held a great council, and finally come to the sorrowful resolution of offering all our lands to you, which lie within the boundary of the United States, for sale, at such price as we can
agree on in council one with the other. These lands are
bounded on one side by the Red River, on another side by
Bayou Pascagoula, Bayou and Lake. Wallace, and the Bayou
Cypress; and on the other side by Texas.

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

447

The United States v. Brooks et al.

"We have never consented to any reservation but one, to be
taken out of these lands, and that was made a great many
years ago. The Caddo nation then gave to their gr6atest and
best friend, called by them Touline, but known to all the
white people by the name of Frangois Grappe, and to his
three sons then born, one league of land each, which was to
be laid off, commencing at the lowest corner of our lands on
the Red River, (as above described,) and running up the river
four leagues, and one league from that line back, so as to make
four leagues of land. We went with our friend and brother
Touline (otherwise Grappe) before the Spanish authority, and
saw it put down in writing, and gave our consent in writing,
and the Spanish authority ratified our gift in writing. But,
before the Americans came, our brother's house was burned,
and the writings we have mentioned were consumed in it.
Touline (otherwise Grappe) was a half-blood Caddo; his
father was a Frenchman, and had done good things for his
son when a boy. When he grew to be a man, he returned
among us, and continued near to us till he died. He was always our greatest counsellor for good. He was our French,
Spanish, and American interpreter, for a great many years; our
brother now is dead, but his sons live.
"1We,therefore, the chiefs and head men of the Caddo nation, pray that the United States will guarantee to the sons
now living of our good brother, deceased, Touline (otherwise
Grappe), the whole of our original gift, - four leagues to him
and to them; and your memorialists further pray, that your
_xcellency will take speedy measures to treat with us~for the
purchise of the residue of our lands, as above described, so
that we may obtain some relief from our pressing necessities ;
and your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray," &c.
This letter was signed by twenty-four chiefs.
Upon the back of this memorial, the President made the
following indorsement.
"The President incloses to the Secretary of War the memorial of the Caddo chiefs, for his considerat;oij, whether it will
not be proper to appoint a commissioner, to obtain a complete
cession of their lands to the United States. There will be
about half a million of acres, it is supposed. Care must be
taken in the instructions that no reservations shall be made in
the treaty; and, if the request [for one of their friends] in the
memorial be adopted at all, it must be in a schedule, which
may be confirmed or rejected by the Senate, without injury
to the treaty.

On the 30th of May, 1835, Jehiel Brooks, the Indian agent,
commenced a negotiation with the Caddo Indians for the
,ession of their land, which continued until the 1st of July,
when the following treaty was made, which was ratified by
the Senate on the 26th of January, 1836, and proclaimed by the

At the ensuing session of Congress, memorials were presented by some of the persons who claimed land situated upon
Rush Island, which was included within the boundaries of the
above cession; and a correspondence was 'xhibited between
Rice Garland, one of the members of Congress from Louisiana,
and Lewis Cass, then Secretary of War. These circumstances
are mentioned here, because they are referred to in the bills of
exceptions. The memorialists alleged that Rush Island had
never belonged to the Caddo Indians, and was fraudulently included in the treaty. On the 30th of December, 1836, a committee of the House of Representatives reported that the title
to the reservation did not pass to the Grappes.
On the 18th of 'January, 1837, Jehiel Brooks, the commissioner, obtained deeds from the devisees of Grappe, he having
devised all his property to his children, by a will duly executed
and recorded. These deeds eonveyed all the land included
within the reservation.
On the 19th of September, 1837, the following memorial
was presented to the Senate of the United States. It was
signed by twenty-one chiefs, many of whom were parties to the

To the Honorable the Senate of the United States :
"The undersigned chiefs, head men, and warriors of the
Caddo tribe of Indians would most respectfully represent unto
your honorable body, that they have, this 19th day of September, 1837, heard the treaty read and interpreted to them by a
white man who understands and speaks their language well, by
which treaty, (concluded between Jehiel Brooks, the Indian
agent, on the one part, and the chiefs, head men, and warriors
of the Caddo Indians on the other part,) the said chiefs, head
nen, and warriors sold to the United States their land; that
they discover that the bounds and limits of the treaty are not
such as they understood at the time of the treaty; that they
contain lands that the Indians never claimed, and never sold,
which land the Indians believed belonged to the United States,
or to the French or Spanish; that the land sold by them to the
United States is contained within the following bounds, to
wit: Bounded on the west by the north and south line which
separates the United States and Mexico, between the Sabine
and Red Rivers, wheresoever the same shall be defined and acknowledged to be by the two governments; on the north and
east by the Red River, from the point where the said north and
south boundary line shall intersect said Red River, following
the western waters of said river down to where the Bayou Cypress empties into the same; thence up Bayou Cypress, following the meanders of the stream, to the western boundary
line; that the said Indians never claimed any of the low lands
between the Bayou Pi'-re (the western channel of Red River)
and the main Red River, which is the eastern channel; that
they know that the land between the Bayou Pierre and the
main channel of Red River has, for a long time, been exclusively settled and claimed by the white people; that the Indians
did riot claim said land, and never requested the Indian agent
to remove them; and further, that they, the said chiefs, head
men, and warriors of the said Caddo Indians, never made any
reserve to any person in the treaty atoresaid, except to Mr.
Larkin Edwards, an old white man that lived among them a
long time; that Mr. Brooks, the Indian agent, told them that
they could give Larkin Edwards a small piece of land if they
wished to do so; that they then told Mr. Edwards that they
would give him a small piece of land anywhere he wanted it
in their lands. The said chiefs, head men, and warriors would
further represent unto your honorable body, that Jediel Brooks
told one of the chiefs that one Jacques Grappe requested him
to ask the Indians for a piece of land on Red River, in the
bottom and on the east side of the Bayou Pierre (the western
water of Red River); that the said chief told Mr. Brooks that
"

The United States v. Brooks et al.

it was not their land, and Mr. Brooks told him that it was their
land. The chief then told Mr. Brooks that, if it was their land,
he was willing to give Jacques Grappe a little piece; but that
they never made any reserve to Franois Grappe, or any of his
heirs or representatives, by the treaty, within the limits of land
they claimed or sold to the United States.
"In witness of the truth of the above statement the said chiefs,
head men, and warriors have hereunto set their hands, the day
of the date above."
On the 22d of May, 1838, a committee of the Senate reported that Rush Island never belonged to the Caddo Indians,
and recommended a confirmation of the titles of certain settlers who were living on it anterior to the treaty between the
United States and Caddoes.
In 1840, memorials were again presented to Congress by
these last-mentioned settlers, and much testimony was taken
by the authority of Mr. Bell, chairman of the committee to
whom the memorials were referred.
In April, 1842, a committee of the House of Representatives
reported in favor of confirming the titles of these settlers, anfd
on the 6th of July, 1842, an act of Congress was passed confirming them. (5 Stat. at Large, 491.)
On the 30th of August, 1842, the joint resolution was passed
which is set forth in the commencement of this statement.
On the 24th of February, 1846, S. W. Downs. the District Attorney of the United States, filed a petition in tie Circuit Court
of the United States for the District of Louisiana against the parties named in this report, alleging that they had unlawfully and
fraudulently taken possession of the land therein described. The
claim of the United States is thus set forth in the petition : "Petitioners allege, that they are the true and lawful owners
of the above-described land and premises, and that the pretended claim of the said possessors is illegal, invalid, and fraudulent; that by the treaty of cession of the province of Louisiana by the French Republic to the United States of America,
and by the treaty between Spain and the United States of
America in 1819, the United States succeeded to all the rights
of France and Spain, as they then were in and over said province, including all lands which were not private property, and
that the aforesaid tract of land, ever since the said treaties, remained vested in the said plaintiffs, who are now the true and
legal owners of the same; that plaintiffs have suffered damage
to the amount of twenty thousand dollars by the disturbance
and occupation of said land by said possessors."
On the 18th of March, 1846, Brooks answered the petition.

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

The United States v. Brooks et al.

He set forth the treaty, its ratification and proclamation; alleged that the heirs of Grappe acquired a perfect title under
the reservation which he had since purchased, and that under
the joint resolution of Congress the District Attorney of the
United States was not authorized to allege fraud against him
as commissioner; that he had sold and delivered sundry parts
of the land to other persons, who were also defendants.
On the 13th of April, 1846, the District Attorney of the
United States filed the following notice to the defendants of
certain evidence which he proposed to offer upon the trial of
the cause.
"UNITED

STATES V. JEHIEL BROOKS ET AL.

" The defendants in the above-entitled cause will take notice that the plaintiffs will offer, as evidence on the trial of this
cause, so much of Report 1035 of the House of Representatives
of the United States of the 27th Congress, second session, as
is hereafter mentioned, to wit: The various reports of the.committees embraced in this report, and the following depositions,
that of Lewis Naville Rembin, Charles Rembin, Thomas Wallace, Jacob Irwin, Joseph Valentine, Sylvester Poissot, Cesair
Lafitee, John Joseph Le Bars, Michel Lattier, Francis Lattier,
Pierre Rublo, Manuel Lafitte, D. M. Heard, Athanase Poissot,
and all the depositions which were taken on the part of the
United States embraced in this report aforesaid ;- also, plaintiffs
will offer in evidence the same depositions, embraced in a similar report and admitted by consent of parties in a suit between Jehiel Brooks v. Samuel Norris, in the District Court of
the parish of Caddo, in said State, said Norris holding title
under the United States, on Rush Island, in which the same
issues were made as in this suit, and said Brooks, plaintiff in
that suit and defendant in this. DefF-ndants are hereby notified to make objection, if any they have, on Friday the 17th
instant, why the testimony aforesaid should not be admitted
on the trial of this cause; said reports and depositions are
herewith filed for reference," &c.
On the 28th of April, 1846, the court overruled so vnrch of
the above motion as proposed to introduce, as evidence, the
report made by a committee of Congress, and disposed of the
remaining part of the motion, viz. that part of it which proposed to introduce certain testimony, by the following order,
applicable to that part of the motion : " UNITED

"cBe it remembered, that on the 13th of April, 1846, a rule

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Brooks et aL.

was taken in this camuse by the plaintiffs, calling on the defendants to show cause on the 17th of the same month why the
depositions of certain witnesses named in said rule, and taken
as therein stated, should not be read in evidence in thi's cause,
when the same shall come on to be tried, as appears in said
rule, which is hereunto annexed, and made a part of this bill
of exceptions; and on the said 17th of April, 1846, Jehiel
Brooks, by his counsel, Thomas H. Lewis, appeared and
showed cause against the said rule, and contended that the
said rule ought to be dismissed and discharged on the following grounds:"1st. The court cannot entertain this rule at the present
stage of the suit, because the only law authorizing such a rule
is an act of the legislature of the State of Louisiana, entitled
'An Act to amend the Code of Practice,' approved Mrarch 20,
1839, (see Acts 1839, page 168, section 17,) and said act does
not apply to the present case, but is only applicable to depositions taken under commissions issued by the court, and in the
suit in which such depositions are offered as evidence.
"2d. The court cannot be called upon to decide upon the
admissibility of any evidence in a cause before the same shall
come on for trial, except in the case pointed out in said act of
20th March, 1839, and these depositions do not fall within the
exception provided for by that act.
"3d. These depositions were not taken in any action or suit
pending before any judicial t-ibunal, or by authority of any tribunal having power to decide upon title to property, or to bind
parties litigant by its decisions.
"4th. There is no evidence before the court of any such suit
as that of Jehiel Brooks v. Samuel Norris, or that these depositions were read in evidence, by consent or otherwise, on the
trial of such suit, and these facts are not admitted.
"5th. If such a suit as Brooks v. Norris did exist, and if said
depositions were read in evidence on the trial thereof, still they
are not admissible in this cause, because the parties to this suit
are not the same as the parties to that of Brooks v. Norris.
" Which grounds of objection being sustained by the court,
the counsel for plaintiffs tendered this bill of exceptions, which
was signed and sealed.

"TPE UNITED STATES V. JEHIEL BROOKS ET AL.

"In the Circuit Court of ihe United States for the Fifth Circuit
and District of Louisiana, Hon. T. H. MeCaleb, Judge ol
the District Court, alone presiding; April term, 1848.
"Be it remembered, that on the trial of this case, on the 5th
day of May, 1848, after the arguments of counsel on both sides
had been closed, and before the-jury had retired to consider on
their verdict, the attorney of the United States prayed the
court to charge the jury as follows, to wit: " First. That the first of the supplementary articles to the
treaty between the United States and the Caddo Indians,
made at the agency-house of the Caddo. nation on the lot of
July, 1835, does not amount in law to a grant of four leagues
of land from the United States to Francois Grappe and his
sons, nor does it amount in law to a reservation then made of
said lands to the said Grappes, but it is simply a reservation
of whatever right the said Grappes may have acquired to said
land by the donation mentioned in the preamble to the supplementary articles to the said treaty.
" Second. That the recital in the said preamble and supple.
mentary articles, of a donation to the Grappes in 1801, does

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

459

The United States v. Brooks et al.

not relieve the defendants from the necessity of producing the
primordial title or Oonation of 1801, nor does said recital prove
the existence of said donation.
" Third. T.at by the laws of Spain, which governed the
loculs bi quo in 1801, the Indians had no primitive title to any
land on this continent; and that in 1801 the Spanish authority
at Natchitoches had no legal right to ratify and confirm the
donation recited in the aforesaid reamble and supplementary
articles.
" Fourth. That, by the laws and usages of the government
of the United States, the Caddo Indians did not hold their land
by the usual Indian title, but that they had been merely permitted to live upon it.
" Fifth. That the legal construction of the Caddo treaty of
the 1st of July, 1838, is, that those Indians merely relinquished
to the United States their permissive' possession of the lands.
" Sixth. That, as all the other defendants, besides Brooks,
are his vendees, and hold title under him, if the jury think
from the evidence that Brooks has no title to the land, then
that the other defendants stand in the same category, and are
also without title.
"But the court refused so to charge the jury, and did charge
them as follows :"First. That the treaty between the United States and the
Caddo Indians on the 1st of July, 1835, and the articles supplementary thereto, having been ratified by the President and
Senate of the United States, is part of the supreme law of the
land, and as such must be respected and enforced by the courts
of the United States.
" Second. That the first supplementary article to the said
treaty, and the preamble thereof, contain a recognition of title
in Franeois Grappe and his three sons to the land described
in said preamble and article, and dispensed them, and those
who hold under them, from producing any other title to said
lands.
" Third. That the United States, by treating with the Caddo
Indians for the purchase of their lands, recognized in said Indians a right to said lands, similar to the rights to lands generally recognized in Indian tribes with whom the United States
have made treaties.
Fourth. That the testimony offered on behalf of the United
States, to prove the lands reserved by the treaty in question to
the Grappes had been fraudulently included within the limits
of the territory ceded to the United States by the Caddo Indians, by the defendant, Jehiel Brooks, while acting as comnmissioner of the United States in making said treaty, was

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Brooks et al.

properly admitted to be read to the jury, and they should consider the same; and if they found said Brooks guilty of fraud,
they should find a verdict for plaintiffs against said Brooks.
" Fifth. That the other defendants stood in a different light
before the court from Brooks, and the jury should inquire (if
they found fraud in Brooks) whether said defendants had notice or knowledge of such fraud when they purchased the land
held by them; and if the jury believed, from the evidence, that
these other defendants (purchasers from Brooks) had notice or
knowledge of such fraud, they should find also against them.
But if, on the contrary, these purchasers had no such knowledge
or notice, then the fraud in Brooks, their vendor, would not
affect their title.
" Whereupon the attorney of the United States for the District of Louisiana excepted to the said refusal and charge, and
tenders this as his bill of exceptions, which he prays may be
signed and made part of the record.
(Signed,)
THEO. H. MCCALEB, U. S. ATudge."
A -writ of error, sued out on behalf of the United State.,
brought these several rulings before this court.
Such is tie history of this transaction before and since it
was brought into court by the United States.
All of us concur in opinion, that no exception was taken by
the counsel of. the United States-to the rulings of the District
Court in this cause, which can be sustained here.
- We think that the treaty gave to the Grappes a fee simple
title to all the rights which the Caddoes had in these lands, as
fully as any patent from the government could make one.
The reservation to the Grappes, "their heirs and assigns for
ever," creates as absolute a fee as any subsequent act upon
the part of the United States could make. Nothing further
was contemplated by-the treaty to perfect the title.
Brooks-being the alienee of the Grappes for the entire reservation, he may hold it against any claim of the United States,
as his alienors would have done.
We have nothing to do, in our consideration of the case,
with the conjectural intimations, which were made in the argument of it, concernifg the influences which were used to secure
the reservation, or the designs of the commissioner in having
it done. The record shows that he became a purchaser for a
valuable consideration. Whether for an adequate one is not
for us to say. His right to the land against the claim of the
United States, as that has been asserted in this case, we think
good, and we shall direct the judgment of the court below to
be affirmed.

The Louisville Manufacturing Co. v. Welch.

Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District
of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel. On consideration
whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court,
that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be,
and the same is hereby, affirmed.

THE LOUISVILLE MANUFACTURING COMPANY, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V.
MICHAEL WELCH.
The following guaranty, viz. "I hereby guaranty the payment of any purchases of
bagging and rope- which Thomas Barrett may have occasion to make between
this and the 1st of December next," extends the liability of the guarantor to purchases upon areasonable credit, made anterior to the 1st of December, although
the time of payment was not to arrive until after that day.
The vendor was not bound to give immediate notice to the guarantor of the amount
furnished, or the sum of nioney for which the guarantor was held responsible. It
was sufficient to give this notice within a reasonable time after the transactions
were closed, and the question what was a reasonable time was a question of fact
for the jury.
If the principal debtor be insolvent at the time when the payment becomes due, even
this notice is not necessary, unless some damage or loss can be shown to have
accrued to the guarantor in consequence of his not receiving such a notice. And
in no instance, in case of a guaranty, will the guarantor be exempt from liability
for want of the notice, unless loss or damage is shown to have accrued as a consequence.
But when a party intends to avail himself of the guaranty by making sales on the
faith of it to the person to whom it is given, sueh~party must give notice, within a
rcasonable tirae, to the guarantor, of his acceptance aid intention to act on it.
Where the guarantor took defence upon the ground that he had before notice given
up securities belonging to the receiver of the guaranty which would have made
him whole, the time of his doing this should have been given to the jury as an essential ingredient for their judgment upon the question whether or not'he had recived reasonable notice of his liability.
.1he admission of the guarantor, when called upon for payment, did not conclusively
bind him as a matter of law, because it may not have been made with a full knowloge of all the facts in the case. It was tlerefore properly left to thL jury to decide whether so made or not.

Tis case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United Srates for the District of Louisiana.
The Louisville Manufacturing Company was incorporated
by an act of the legislature of Kentucky, and was domiciliated
and transacting business in that State.
On the 3d of May, 184-5, Michael Welch gave to one Thomas Barrett the following letter of credit, viz.: " hereby guaranty the payment of any purchases of bag39 *i,
