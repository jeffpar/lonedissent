The verdict and judgment being against the Defendant, he brought his writ of error.
E. I. Ira, for 4he Platntijj z error, contended,
I. That the Plaintiff's evidence did not maintain his
action.

If he- had any cause of 'action it was upon the sealed
instrument. There was no evidence of. the request of
the Defendant to the Plaintiff to pay the money, and he
was under no legal obligation to pay it. He was not a
party-to the judgment on the pripon-bounds-bond. The
receipt states the judgment to be paid by the notes of
the Plaintiff and others; but it does not appear that the
Plaitliffhas ever paid this note.

!Z.There is no evidence to take the case out of the
statufe of limitations, exceptthe testimony of II,'Donald,
which is too vague and indefinite.
a. The Defeidant bfing been discharged under the
insolvent act, no suit can be maintained against him
without showing that he has, acquired new property
since his discharge.
SwA N, contea.

i. The Plaintiff was no party to the sealed instrument. He is only named in the recital. It contained
no contract gn the part of the Defendant to pay the
Plaintiff. But it is evidence from wInch the jury iight
infer that the Plaintiff had paid the money at his request. It is true there was no positive evidence that
the, note had been paid, but there are circumstances
from which the jury might infer it.
2. The recital in the instrument acknowledging the
debt was on the i5th of July, 1801, and the suit was
brought upon the ist of July, 1809 so that b years had
not elahled.
S. The'discharge tinder the insolvent law,, only dischargegs the person-it is no bar ta an action.
farch th.... lUthe Judges (except Dtrvalt, J.) bezvg
present,
MiAsHA.L, Oh. .T. delivered the opinion of the court
to the following effect:

In this case the whole evidence is spread upon the
record by the bill of exceptions, and the Court belowrefused to instruct the jury (as requested by the Defendant) that it was not sufficient in law to enable the
Plaintiff tor recover in this action.
If the Court ought to have given this instruction,
their refusil'is certainly error.
The evidence shows that a note was given, or money
paid by the Plaintiff for the use dft the Defendant, but

it is,
v.
Defendant. If the Plaintiff was not blound :to pay it,

and if it was paid without te request of the Defendant,

Rwnnin.

it is certain that the Plaintiff is.not entitled to recover .
Butthe Court thinks that theatcital in the deed of as-.
signment is evidence from winchthe jury mightinfitr a
request,
The Court is also of opinion thit the recital in the,
dee.d&is sufficient to take the case out of the statute of
limitations. .Although the Court is not v illing to. extend the. effect of casual or accidental -pxpressions fartber than it has b'dn, to take a case out of that stattute,
and although the Cnurt nght be of- opinion -that, the
cases on that point have gone too farp yet this is not a
casual or incautious expression. the deed admits the
debt to be due on the Vth of July, 1801, alifive years
bad not afterwards elapsed before the suit was brought.
Then it is objected that -there is no evidence of the
payment of the. money'by'the PIaintiff, but the Court
thinks- that the recital of the deed is evidence from
which the jury might"infer the.payment.
There was no error respecting. the discharge, lner
the insolvent act. It was only a discharge-,of the person, and could not affect the judgment.
