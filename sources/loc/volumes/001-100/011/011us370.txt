Lewis Hipkins, deceased, and in the month of June in

that year the cause came on to be heard by consent of

Lewis Hipkins be sold and the money broughtinto Court.

UiAbtni T

The report of the salb does not appear on the record,
but an entry was made that the report was made and
confirmed by the Court.
Under this decree the pre.mises were sold and con-veyed to the Defendant, E. L Lee, who purchased in
trust for P R. Fendall, one of the executors of Lewis
lipkins. On the deed of conveyance is a miemorandum
stating that the property was sold subject to dower.
Lee conveyed the premises to the other Defendants,
trustees of P R. Fendall, for the purposes of a trust
deed which had been previously executed conveying to
them the other two thirds of the same estate on certain
trijsts in the deed recited.
The trustees sold and conveyed to the Defendant, Joseph Deane.
The bill states that the Defendant, Joseph Deane,
bad not paid the purchase money, and was willing,
should the Court decree dower in the premises, to give
an equivalent in money in lieu thereof.
Soon after the trust deed from Susanna Hipkins to
John and Westley Adams she intermarred with the
Plaintiff, Richard Wren.
Philip R. Fendall continued to pay the Plamtiff, Su-

.ianna, during her widowhood, and the Plaintiffs, Rich-

ard and Susanna, after their intermarriage, one third
part of the, rent accruing on the premises devised to
hlin by Ilipkins and wife until the year iS03 since
which he has refused or neglectedto pay the same.

The Circuit Court determined that the lim. of the
Plaintiff, Susanna, to dower 'was not liarred, and decreed her a sum in gross as an equivalent therefor.
From this decree the trustees of Philip Richard Fen-.

In a suit in Cfiancery, if a question of dower arise,

will send it to a Counst of law to be tried.
The Courts of the United States are forbidden by

there is a remedy at law. A Court of equity takes cognizance of no case of dower which does not inv1ie

None of the facts upon which the claim of dower is

right is founded on particular facts thereit'stated.

of law and equity have a concurrent jurisdiction in
dower, if the facts are not denied upon whch the claim
of- dower is founded, such as seizure, &c. In general
a -Court of Chancery i the proper tribunal. A discqvery is alvnost always sought; partition is frequently

In this case a partition was necessary, and that is a
special ground of equitable jurisdictiQn.
But the property had been sold by order of Court,
expressly subject to dower, and the deed to Deane contamed a covenant to indemnify hun against the claim of
dower. A Court of Chancery can call allparties before
-it, -and by decreeing a compensation in lieu of land,
prevent circuity of action. The widow and the purchaser had consented to sucha decree. An account of
rents and profits was also necessary. The act of Congress prohibiting the resort to Chancery where there is
a remedy at lawo,is only an affirmance of a principle of
the common law.

But the most formidable objection arises upon the devJse to her by the will. That devise was not exprpssly

accepted the lands devised in lieu -of dower; nor that
her husband was seized of such an estate in those lands
as would be a bar if she had accepted them.

expressly, or by averment, in lieu Qf dower," &c. "suh

IThe Court had no right to decree money
in Ilieu of
the land without consent of the creditors.
No arrearages of dower can be recovered for the time
preceding the demand.
February 26th....MARSHALL, Ck. J1. after stating the
case, delivered the opinion of-the Court as follows
The material questions in the cause are
1. Has a Court of equity jurisdiction in the case?
2. Is the Plaintif, Susanna, entitled to dower?
a. If these points be in her favor what decree ought
the Court to make?
According to the practice which prevails generally
in England, Courts of equity and Courts of law exercise a concurrent jurisdiction in assigning dower.
Many reasons exist in England in favit of this jurisdiction. one of which is, that partitions are made and
accounts are taken in chancery in a manner highly favorable to the great purposes of justice. In this case
dower is to be assigned in an undivided third part of an
estate, oo that it is a case of partition of the original
estate as well as of assignment of dower in the part of
which Lewis lipkms died seized.

FEBRUARY X1R

101

An additional reason afiid a conclusive oii6 in -favoir utn.RTu
bf the jurisdiction of a Court of equity is this. The & OTHERS
V.
lands are in' possession of a purchaser who has not yet
paid the purchase money. A Court of law could ad.. wnni
judge to the Plantiffs only a third part of the land it- &onTHES,
self. Now, if the Plaintiffs be willing to leave the purchaser undisturbed, to affirm the sales and to receive a
compensatioh for her dower instead of the land itself, a
Court of equity ought never, by refusing its aid, to
drive her into a Court of law and compel her fo'receive
her dower in the lands themselves, Tins is therefore
a proper case for application to a Court of' Chanceryi
2. It is perfectly clear that the provision made by
Lewis Hipkmns in his last will is no bar to a claim of
dower for several reasons, of which it will be necessary
to mention only two.
i. It is not expressed to be made in lieu of dower.
2. It is not averred that she has accepted the pro.
stn and still enjoys it.
3. It remains to inquire what decree the Court ought
fo make in the case.
The first question to be discussed is thins. Is the
PlaintifT, Susanna, entitled both to dower and to the
provision made for her m the will of her late husband?
The law of Virginia has been construed to authorxz
an averment that the provision in the will is made in
lieu of dower, and to support that averment by matter
dehors the will. But, with the exception 'of this allowance to prove the intention of the testator by other
testimony than may be collected from the will itselt, the
act of the Virginia legislature is not understood in any
respect to vary the previously existing conunon law:
In the English books there are to be found many de.
cisions in which the widow has been put to her electioui
either to take her ower and relinquish the provision
made for her in the will, or to take that provision and
pelinquish her dower. There are othe- casea in whwk

she has been permitted to hold both. The principle
& OTHEiRS upon which these cases go appears to be this
iEizniRT
"V.

It is , maxim in a Court of equity not to peizmit tho
&oTHERs. same person to hold under and against a will. If tbore,
fore it be manifest, from the face of the will, that the
testator did not'intend the provision it contains for his
widow to be in addition to her dower, but to be in lieu
of it; if. his intention discovered in other parts of the
w-ill must be defeAted by the allotment of dower to the
widow, she must renounce either her dpwer, or the benefit shre claims under the will. But if the two provisions
may stand well together, if it may fairly be presumed
that the testator intended the devise or bequest to his
wife as additional to her dower, then she May hold both.
WRN

The cases of Arnold v. Kempstead and wife, of Villarael and 'lord Galway, and -f Jones v. Collier and
others, reported hy Ambler, are all cases in which,
uion the principle that has been stated, the widow was
put to her election.
In the case under consideration neither party derives
ny aid from extrinsic circumstances, and therefore the
case must depend on the will itself.
The.value iQf the provision made for the wife compared with the whole estate is not in proof but so tar
as a judgment on this point can be formed on the evidence furnished by the will itself, it was supposed by
him to be as ample as his circumstances would justify
The orjly fund provided for themaintenance and edu,
cation of his five children is the rent of 1401. per anium, payable by P R. Fendall. Since he has made a
distinct provision for his wife, the presumption is much
against his intending that this fund should be diminished by being charged with her dower.
That part of the will, too, which authorizes P R. Fendall, in the event of building a mill and not receiving
from the sons of the testator their half of its value, to
hold the premises until the rent. should discharge that
debt, indicates an intention that in such case the whole
rent should be retained.

FEBRUARY TERM 1813.
The clause, too, directing the residue of his estateto TmuR,,i'r
be sold for the payment of debts is indicative of an ex- & oTimRs
v.
pectation that the property stood discharged of dower,
and is a complete disposition of his whole estate. The wnHN
testator appears 'to have considered himself as at liber- &OTHEns.
ty to arrange his property without any regard to the
,ucumbrance of dower.
Upon this view of the will it is the opinion of the
majority of the Court that the testator did not intend
the provision made for his wife as additional to her
dower, and that she cannot be permitted to hold both.
She has not however lost the right of election. N9
evidence is before the Court that she has accepted the
provision of the will, nor that she still enjoys it.
Indeed there is much reason to suppose the fact to be
otherwise. The decree of :.8035 does not except the
lands decreed to her for life from its operation, nor is
the Court informed by the evidence that those lands
were not sold under it.
But if she had accepted that provision and still enjoyed it, there is no evidence that she considered herself
as holding it in lieu of dower. On the contrary, she
was in the actual perception of one third of the rent accruing on the lease held by P R. Fendall, and in the
deed executed by her in 1797, before heir second mar-.
riage, she conveys her dower in the lands leased to Fendall, and also her dower in the lands devised to her by
her deceased husband. It is therefore apparent that
she never intended to abandon her claim to dower.
The next enquiry to be made by the Court is, to
what profits is the Plaintiff, Susanna, entitled in consequence of the detention of dower?
It is unnecessary to decide whether, in general, a person claiming dower from a purchaser can recover
profits winch accrued previous to the institution of her
suit. In this case the Plaintifr was in the actual enjoyment of dower. She received one third of the rent ac
cruing from the premises for nine years; She was
therefore in full possession of her dower estate, and
when afterwards the land was sold under a decree of a

SUPREME COURT U. S.
0 riuaw Court, P R. Fendall was one7 of the'executors who made
& OTEMUS tile sale, and was himself in effect the purchaser of the
v.
estate. Upon no principle could he justify the refusAl
vRB.N to pay that portion of the rent which was equal to her
&oTIERs. doWer in, the- land, unless on the'pnncaple that she was
- Qt entitled to dower. In this case therefore the Plaintiff is entitled to one third of it0l. per annum for the
remaining four years of the lease under which P 14
Fendall held the land, anil to an account for profits after
the expiration of the lease.
But th6 Plaintiff, Susanna, cannot claim the profits
on her dower and hold any portion of the particular
estate devised to her, or of the'profits on that estate.
An account therefore must be taken, if required by the
Defendants, showing what she has received under the
vill of-her husband. TIq must be opposed to the profits to which she to entitled for dower, and the balance
laccd to the credit of the party in whose favor itmay be.
It remains to enquire witethet- the allowance of a sum
in gross in lieu of dower in the land itself, or of the interest on one third of the purchase ntoney, might legr.t,y bo made,
This must be considered as a compromise between
the Plaintiffs and the Defendant, Deane. His assent
being averred in 'the bill, and The bill being taken pro
confesso as to him, this may be considered as an arrangeinebt to wich he has consented. 'Tis, however, cannot affect the other Defendants. They have a right to
insist 'that, instead of a sum in gross, one third of the
purchase money shall be set apart and the interest therepf paid annually to the tenant in dower during her life.
If the parties all concur in preferring a sum in gross
to the decree which the Court has a right to make, still
it is uncertain on what priiciple seven years were' taken
as the vitdue of the life of the tenant in d6wer. It is
probably a reasonable estimate, but this Court does not
perceive on what principles it was made, nor does the re.
cord furnish the means of judging of its reasonableness.
.This Court is of opinion that there is error Xn the
decree of the Circuit Court in not requiring -the Plain-

manded for further proceedings in conformity with the'&oTAiElS,
following decree
This Court is of opinion that the Plaintiff, Susanna,
is not barred of her right of dower in the lands of which
her late husband, Lewis Hipkms, died seized, but that
,.she cannot hold both hei dower and the property to

Lewis. She ogght therefore to have made her election
either to adhere to her legal rights and renounce those
under the will, 'or to adhere to the will and renounce
her legal rights, before a decree could be made -in her
favor.
This Court is farther of opinion .that the Plaintiff,
Susanna, having been in possession of her dower by the
receipt of rent for several years after the death of her
late husband, Ls, in the evetit of her electing to adhere
to her.claim of do'wer, entitled to receive from the estate of P R. Fend-all the profits winch have accrued on

Defendant, Jostph Deane, and is entitled to receive from
the said Joseph Deane the profits which have accrued
thereon since the same. was sold and conveyed to him,
to ascertain which an account ought to be directed.
And the Court is further of opinion that an account
ought also to be directed to ascertain how much the said
Susanna has received from the estate of her late husband, and what profits she has receive.d from'the estate
devised to her in his will: all which must We deducted
from her claim for dower.
The Court'is .further of opufton that if the parties or
either of them shall he dissatisfied with the allotment of
a sum in gross, and shall prefer to have one third part
of the purchase money, given by the said Joseph Deane
for the lands in which the Plaintiff, Susanna, claims
dower, set apart and secured to her for her life, so that.

It is the.opinion of this Court that there is no error
in the decree of the Circuit Court for the county- of

was entitled to dower in the estate of her late husband,
Lewis Hipkmns, deceased, but that there is error in not
requiring her to elect between her dower and the provision.iade for her in the will of her late husband, and
in not decreeing profits on the same. This Court doth
therefore reverse and annul the said decree, and doth

remand the cause to the said Circuit Court with instructions to reform the said decree according to the directions hereito contained.
