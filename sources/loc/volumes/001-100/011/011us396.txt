In January, 1805, the legislature of Virginia, at the
request of the society, passed a law changing the ori.
ginal plan of the institution, by separating the town
buildings from those in the country, and making the
town buildings liable only for town losses, and the
country buildings for country losses. Thi law directed that there shQidd be' a re-valuation of the buildings
which had'been previously insured, and authorized the
society, as in the first instance, to fix the rates of hazard, and make such by-laws, rules and regulations as
they myght think prqper,
The society was authorized to recover its debts by
inotion, in a summary manner.
Under the act of 1805. the society made a new tariff1
of rates of hazard.

The houses of the Defendants were re-valued under
the act. The re-valuation was less than the original
waluation, but the rate of hazard, or in other words,
tie premium for the insurance, was increased underthe
new regulation,

"which according to the new rafos of hazard ought to b

In July, 1805, the Defendants, Korn and Wisemiller,
agreeably to a form prescribed by the society, made a
declaration, under their hands and sgals, as follows.
fWVe do hereby declare and affirm, that we hold the
-abovementioned buildings, with the land on which
- they stand, in fee simple, and that they are not, nor
" shall be insured elsewhere, and that -we wilt abide, ob" serve and adhere to the.constitution, rules and reguhere-lations;which are already established, or may

' sen~t in person or by representatives, or by the ma,,jority of thle property -insured, represented either by
f' the persons themselves, or their proxy duly auMthor' rized, or their deputy, as establisked by law, at any

To this declaration were annexed, a plat, ,description

that thei.zn
proprietors of houses in Alexandtia, still continued

members of the society, notwithstanding their separa,
tion from the state of Virginia, and were bound by allthe by-laws and regulations of the society.

The only remaining question is whether the Defendants are liable for the new rates of premium. It was
just that the old members and the new should stand on
the same ground and pay the same. rates of premium
where the risl was the same.

C. L,,

contra.

The former case has settled the point that the Defendants are boind by their original contract in 1796.
1 he legmlature had no right to alter or vacate that
contract. There was nothing unjust- or hard im the
case. The additional premium ought to be confined to
cases of excess upon re-valuation.
SAYAWN, In rCply.
The act of assembly of 1805 was passed at the request of the society, of which the Defendants were members, and bound by the acts of the majority.
MIarch 3d....JoHivso , J. delivered the opinion of the
Court as follows:
In the case decided between. Atkinson- and these
Plaintiffs, February term, 1810, the question arose on
.the construction of the 7th section of the act of 1805,
and the additional premium in that case was .imposed
upon a re-valuation without relation to a change in the
rates of premium, but resulting from the increased vilt-

ation.

In this case the sum demanded arises from the
changes made in the rates of prmiium. arming from a

centage to be paid by the present members of the cornpany, in conformity to what is to be imposed upon stqb- Kor-9 &
sequent applicants for insurance. And it is contended wisFMILthat the contract being cemplete between the parties, LER.
the insurers cannot add to thie consideration to be paid
for insurance. In general this doctrine is unquestiona,bly correct, buteculiar circumstances except this from
ordinary cases. This ,subject was considered in the
quoted case decided between these same parties in February, 1810. It is there laid down, and on reflection we
are confirmed in the opinion, that in the capacity of an
individual of the body corporate the Defendants are
bound by the by-law of the society as far as is consistent with the nature of its institutibn.
This case is within the 4th section of the 8th article
of those by-laws, and therefore the judgment below
ought to have been for the Plaintiffs.
