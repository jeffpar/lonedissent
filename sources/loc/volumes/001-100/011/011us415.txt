the declaration was not recovered-ta& the suit then depending for the recovery th6feof, -whereas the coiitract HARWOOD.
produced in evidence contained no limitation to a recovery in that particular suit. We are satisfied however that the Plaintiff has leclared according to the true
intent of the parties as apparent on the contract. It
could never have been their intention to postpone the
right to a return of the tobacco or its value, beyond the
time of a recovery or failure in the suit then depending.
Any other consti:.ction would have left the rights of
the.parties in suspense for an indefinite. period, wholly
inconsistent with the avowed objects of thp contract.
On the whole, it is the opinion of the Court that the
judgment be affirmed -with costs.

CHESAPEAKE

INS. CO.

On a case stated, the judgment of the Court below
was for the Defendants, ojn which the Plaintiff brought
his writ of error.
IIARPER f0e Flaintiff u error,contended,

1. That where an insurance is made in gross, as in
total loss of this case, upon a cargo consisting of a number of sepathe cargo.
rate distinct things there may be a total loss upon some
of them, though the rest are saved, and
have prevented an actual

2d. That as consequently the loss here upon the hides
fished up would have been total but for the labor and
care of the assured, they are entitled to be reimbursed
the expense, by the underwriters, under the stipulation
in the policy on that subject, viiotwithstanding the declaration in the memorandum, exempting hides from
particular average.
1. The obvious construction and meaning of the memorandum is, that where The cargo is divisible, there
may be a total loss of part. The average loss mentioned is loss by deterioration. If one out of many bales of
cloths shoudd be lost, it would be a total loss of that
bale.-But if one piece in a bale should be damaged
and lost, it would be an average, loss. especially as to
memorandum articles. If a cat-go should consist of
500 casks of wine, and 499 of thvim shottld be lost, one
only being saved, this would be a total loss of the 99
casks.
In the absence of allluthority, we must resort to general principles. Such cases must have existed oftenbut no case is found in the books like the present. The
inference is, that it must have been considered as a total loss.
2. The 2d point, (as to the salvage) is 'perhaps a
-point of more difficulty, but it depends in part upon
the first. Where the object o" the expense is to preveut
a total loss, the underwriters are liable. Here the sal'vage loss prevents a total loss.
If a literal construction be given to the two stipulations in the policy, one Would destroy the other. The

SUPREME COURT U S.
Iznrsg
v.'
enEsAP?,AKx
ir's. co.

Whatever may have been the motive to theintroduction of this clause into policies of insuiiance, whichwas
done as early as the year ,71,9, and most probabiy with
the intention o protecting insurers against losses arising solely from 4 deterioration of the article, by its
own perishable quality--or whatever anibiguity may
once have existed from the term average being used in
different senses, that is as signifying a contribution to a
general loss, and also a particular.orpartial inujuy falling
on tile subject insured, it is well understood at the present day, with respect to such articles, that underwriters are. free from all partial losses of every kind, which
do not arise from a contribution towards a general ave_rage It mnly remains then to examine, and so the question has properly been treated at bar, whether the hides,
which were sunk and not reclaimed, constitted a total
or partial loss within the meaning of this policy. It has
been considered as' total By the counsel of the assured,
but the Court cannot perceive any ground for treting it
in that way, inasmuch as out of many -thousand hides
which were on board, not quite eight hundred were lost,
making in.point of value somewhAtt less than one sixth
part' of tie 'um insured by this policy If theme were
jio memorandum in the way, and the Plaintiffhad gone
on to recover, as in that case lie nught have donei it is
perceived at once that he must have had judgment only
for a 'paitial loss, which would have been equivalent to
the injury. actimlly sustaid. But without having recourse to any reasonmg on the subject, the proposition
appears too self evident not to command universal asseut. that when, only a part of a cargo, coiisisting,all
of'the same kind of articles, is lost in any way what.eV(, and -the residue, (which in this case amowits to

Puch the greatest part.) arr~ives in safety at its port of
Alestination, thle loss cannot but be partial, and that this
umst fbrev~e be so, as lon g as a part continues to be le,-s
than the 'whole. This loss then being a particular Ion
bily, and.'not resulting from a general average, the
Court is of opinion that the Defendants, are not liable
for it.

Having disposed of this point, it would seem as if
much difficulty could not occur in deciding the other
question, which has been made in this cause, and that
is,-whether the assured is not entitled to recover the

This liabiliy is supposed to result from that clause PEAiLz

in the policy, which authorizes the assured, " in case ims.'co;
'of any &wsordatmage, to sue labor and'travel for, in
-"and about the defence, safeguard and recovery of the
"sgoods, or, any part thereof, to the charges whereof
",the assurers will contribute-according-.to the amount
" of the sum insured." If this clause bo.construed with
reference to what is most evidently its sulject matter,
that is a loss with ii the policy, and in connexion with
other parts of the instrument, it seems irnpossibleto mnu.,
understan4 it, or that it should receive so extensive an
applicatioi as the plaintiff. is desirous of giving to it.
The parties certainly meant to apply it only to the case
of those, losses or hnjuries for which the assurers, if
they had happened, wodld have been responsibi.Having, in such cases only, an antereft in rescuing or
relieving the property, it is reasonable tha then ,only
they should defray the charges ircurred 4y an effort
made for that purpose, hut when a loss tukes place.
winch cannot -be thiown on them, it would require
much stronger and more explicit stipulation than we find
in the policy to render them tible to contribute to rich
exp.enses. If a cargo be insured for a long voyage
against sea risks only, and a capture intervene thervery
day after the vessel leaves port; it is very clear'that the
underwriter is not only not liable for such a loss, ,but
that lie derives ar advantage from it, as his risk may
be terminated thereby, and' the whole prcmiym be earned, and yet if the construction now endeavoured to be
put on thls clause should prevail, all the expenses of

claimimg a propertyj in which lie had no interest, and
which if. condemned is a -matter of indifference.to him,
and all the costs of pursuing it through an almost endless litigation, would )e thrown, whether the pursuit
were successful or otherwise, or an insurer who, had
taken care to restrict his liability to losses by perils of
the sea only The Court cannot subscribe to such an
interpretation, when a more. natural, rational, and obvious one, and that without departini from the letter of
the instrument, presents itself, which i., that tins clause
tan never applV but in such cases as %ould, if they hap-.
