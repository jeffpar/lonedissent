In this case a majority Of the Court is of opinion
that the rule adopted in ordinary cases is not applicable to a case circumstanced as this is, where the receiver is a public officer not interested in the event of the
suit, and who receives on account of the United States,
where the payments are indiscrimmatoly made, and
where different sureties, under distinct obligations, are
interested. It will be generally admitted that moni-s
arising due, and collected subsequently to tile executibn
of the second bond, cannot be applied to the discharge
of the first bond, without manifest injury to the surety
in the second bond and vzce -versa, justice between the
different sureties can only be done by reference to the
collector's books, and the evidence which they contain
may be supported by parol testimony, if any in the
possession of the parties interested.
The Court is of opinion that the Circuit Court erred
in the opinion given, and that it be reversed.
