A doubt having been suggested, whether tins Court

was submitted to this G qurt without argument.

GOODWIN.
WASHINGTON,

3. delivered the opinion of the Coifrt--

as follows
This case stands upon a writ of .error to the Circuit
Court, for the District of Pennsylvania. Bythe record,
it appears, that an action of debt was brought, in the
name of the United States, against the Defendant in error,-mn the District Court of Pennsylvania, in which
judgment was rendered for the United States. On a
writ of error to the. Circuit Court for that District, that
judgment was reversed;- and upon like process,the
cause has been brought into tins Court, for re-examination. A .rule has been obtained by the Defendant in
error, upon the Uhited States, to show cause why the
writ of error should not he dismissed, and the ground of
the rule is, that, as the cause was not removed from the
District into the Circuit Court, by appeal, but by writ of
error, there is. no -provision in any of the laws of the
United States, giving jurisdiction to this Court, to reexamine thejudgment- of the Circuit Court, upon a writ
of error or otherwise. This question can only he decided by an attentive consideration of the different acts
of Congress on this subject.
The 21ist section of thejudicial law of'I789, declares,
that from final decrees in a District Court in cases of admiralty and maritime 3ursdiction, where the mattfr in
dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds 300 dollars, ai appeal shall be allowed to the Circuit Court. The 22d section
provides, that final decrees and jupgments ingivil actions,
in a District Court, where the matter in dispute-exceeds
thevalue-of 50 dollars, exclusive of costs., may he re-examined and reversed or affirmed in a Circuit Court, upon a writ of error This section thbn 'proceeds to dedare, that, upona Iike.process, (that is to say, upon a writ
of error,) may final judgments and decrees n civil actions
and suits i Equity, in a Circuit Court, brought there
by original process, or removed there from the State
Courts, or by appeal from a DistrctCourt, wher the valueexceeds 2,000 dollars, exclusive of costs, be re-examined *nd reversed' or affirmed in the Supreme Court,

far changes the above sectious of the act of 1799, that
GooD-iN. whereas the latter allows an appeal, from the District to
the Cirpuit Court,.only in admiralty and maritime cases,
where the vAlue in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds
300 dollars, the former provides, an appealfram allfinal

and also an appealto the Supreme Court, from all final decrees andjudgments in a Circuit'Court, in cases of Equity, of Admiralty and Maritimejurisdiction, and of prize.
dr no plize,. where the value, exclusive of costs, exceeds
2,000 dollars. Ifuttths law makes no provision for the
'appellate jurisdiction of the Supr'eme Courtin any other
cases than those above mentioned. Consequently, we
must refer,tb the sections of the act of 1789, before noticed, (vhifch are still in force, except so far as they are
inconsistent with the provisions of the act of 1803,) t,
see in what- cases, other than those provided for by
'the act of 1803, the Supreme Court can review the de,c sions of the Circuit Courts. If has been shown, that
,.1 final jujlgments or decrees in"civil actions and suits
in equity,4n. a Circuit Court, brought t'a(re by original
process, ,or rem ved from the State Courts, or by appeal
from a Distrt Court, may be re-examined in the Suprome Court; upon':awrit of error. But no case can,
under-this act, be-removed from a District Court byappeal, except itlbe of admiralty and maritime, jurisdiction, and, eonsequently, under the literal construction
of
Jawi- no other cases could be carried from the
jis
Circuit. Court to the Supreme Court. The question
then, is, whether tjie word appeal, in the 22d section, is
to be understood technically, or merely as descriptive
of the appellate jurisdiction of the Superior Court,
without regard to the particular mode by which a cause
is transmitted to. that jurisdiction? This question appears- to have been cdisidered by the Supreme -Court
so ea4y as the year 1796, ia the case of Wisearl v.
Dauchy. Chief Justice Ellsworth, in deliverjug the
opibion of the Court in that-uaSe, expresses hiiself, as
follows -- ,, The act-of 1789, speaks of appeal and writ
of-errorbutdoes not confound them. They are to be understood acqording, to their ordinary acceptation. An
appeal is a-civil law process, and removes a cause entirely, subjecting the law and fac, to a review alid re-

maritimeocauses, an appeal-is allowed from the District ..
to-the Circuit Court, if,
the iiatter in dispute exceeds
300 dollars, and yet decrees and judgments in civil actions'may be removed by writ -of error, from the Disp
trict to the Circuit Court, though the value barely exceeds 50 dollars." In another part of this opinion, the
judge adds, ",that as to the appellate jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court, the 22dsection says, and qort a likeprocess,.that is, upon a writ of error, shall finaljudgmenta
afid decrees in civil actions, viz cases not -criminal,

be brought to the Supreme Court, by writ of error, are
cases wlichhad been removed to the 'Circuit Court, ty

of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction."
The objection made to this interpretation of the word

only. in a Circuit Court, if -well founded in itself, could
not, with any propriety -be addressed to courts, after

technical distinctioir between a writ of error and an appeal, pnd between the different cases to which they were
applicable; was clearly niarked in the act-of 13th February, 180i, which was afterwards repealed by the
act*of the 8th of March, 1802. The former act, after
providing for the removal of all fnal judgments or decrees, above the value of 50 dollars, from a District to
a Circuit Court, ty appeal, and by a like -proceeding'
for a removal to, the Supreme-Court, of those cases only,- wluch were of equity, of admiralty "..
d.maritime
jurisdiction, and of prize or no prize, proceeded toprovide for civil actions at common law, originating in
a District Court, by declaring that final j udgmenfs, in
such cases, if of a certain value, might be removed, at
'nce, fromu the District to the Supreme Court, by writ
of error. So, that as-the law'stood at that time, a par
ty, in cases at common -law, had an election to carry his
case, where it exceeded 2,000 dollars, by writof error,
from the District to the Circuit Court, umder the 92d
