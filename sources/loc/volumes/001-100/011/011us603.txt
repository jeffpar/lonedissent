There is also a condition to avoid the grant, as to so
much of the granted premises as should not be possessed, inhabited or planted by the means or procurement
of the patentees, their heirs or assigns, in the space~of
21 years.
The third and last of*the letters patent referred to,

The said act of assembly then rccites,'that Thomas
'lord Fairfax, heir at law of lord, Culpeper, had become
",sole proprietor of-the said territory, 'with the ajpurtenanwes, and the above recited letters patent."
By andther act, of assembly, passed in the year 1748,
[Rev. Cod, 'v. I. ch. 4, p. 10] certain grants from the
crown, made while the txach boundaries of the North-

determined, were, with the express consent of lord Fairfax, confirmed to the grantees, to be held, nevertheless
of hin, and all the rents, services, profits and emoluments, (reserved by such grants) to be paid and performed to him.

In another act of assembly, passed May, 1779, for
establishing a land office, and ascertaining the terms
.and manner of granting waste and unappropriated
lands, there is the following clause, viz.. [vide Chy
Rev, of 1783, ch. 13, s. 6, p. 98] " And that the proprietors of land within this commonwealth, may no
longer be subject to any servile, feudal or precarious
tenure, and to prevent the danger to a free statb from

quit rents, and all other reservations and conditions in
the patents or grants of land from the crown of England, under the former government, shall be, and are
hereby declared null and void, and that all lands, thereby respectively granted, shall be held in absolute and
unconditional property, to all intents, and purposes
whatsoever, in the same manner with the lands hereafter to be granted by the comnionwealth, by virtue of
this act."
2 . As respects the actual exercise of his proprietary
rights by lord Fairfax.

It is agreed that he did, in the year 174,8, open and
conduct, at his. own expense, an office within the Northern Neck, for granting and conveying what lie described and called the -waste and ungranted lands therein, upon certain terms, and accordi.ig to certain rules

and demising or lives and terms of years as aforesaid,
and received and enjoyed the rents annually, as they
accrued, as well under the grants in fee, as under the
leases for lives and years. It is also agreed. that lord
Fairfax died seized of lands in the Northern Neck,
equal to about 300,000 acres, which had been granted
by him in fee, to one T. B. Martin upon the same tbrms
and conditions, and in the same form, as the other
grants in fee before de'scribed, which lands were, soon
after being so granted, reconveyed to lord Fairfax in
fee.
3d. Lord Fairfax being a citizen and inhabitant of
Virginia, died in-the month of December, 1781, and- by
his last will and testament, duly made and published,
devised the whole of Ins lands, &c. called or known by
the name of the Northern Neck of Virginia, in fee to
DennyaFmrfax, (the original Defendant in ejectment)
by the name and description of the reverend Denny
Martin, &c. upon condition of his taking the name and
arms of Fairfax, &c. and it is admitted that he fully
complied-mith the conditions of the devise.
sth. It is agreed that Denny Fairfax, -the devisee,
was a native born Britith subject, and never became a
citizen of the United States, nor any one of them, blt
always resided in England, as well dnrifig the revolutionary war, as from his birth about the year 1750, to
his death, which happened some time between the years
796 and 1803, as appears from the record of the proceedings in the Court of Appeals.
It is also dmitted that lord Fairfax left, ht his dpath,
a nephew named Thomas Bryan Martin, who was always a:-citizen 'of Virginia., being the younger brother
of the said devise, and the second-son of a sister of the
said lord Fairfax, which sister was still living, and
had always been a British subject.

C. LrE and JoNE.s, on the paif of the Plaintiff in error, conteuae,
Ist. That lord Fairfax was, at his deatlip seized of
an abstilute and unconditional estate of niheriinice in
the w.hole of'that description of land, within the bouuniaries of his letters patent, designated by m as ", waste
and ungs'anted ;" that is to say, in all the lands within
thbse boundaries, except such as had been parcelled out
into tenements, and granted in fee, by himself or his
ancestors, or predecessors, or by his or their consent or
authority , and tat he was in the actual seizin and
possession of the soil, with the like title to the immediate per-ancy and fruition of the profits, and under the.
like sanctions. as ordinary lrprp.(tors in fee, under
grants derived from the crown prior to the revolution.
2d. That the estitte, by virtue of the will of lord Fairfax, vested in Denny Fairfax, the devisee. and has
never been divested out of him. by office found and
seizure, nor by any equivalent made of confiscationikatsoever, and that the treaty of peace found hni
seized of the estate unaltered from the condition in
which it was originally taken under the devise;
3d. That the treaty of peace prohibited the confiscation of the estate, whether by inquest of office, or by
any other mode whatsoever, and so operated a release
and confirmati,:n to the British :proprietor, whose title
was again explicitly acknowledged and confirmed by
the' treaty of 1 79-, wihi h completely removed every in..
capacity and disability that might possibly be supposed
to remain-in him, as a landed proprietor.

Virginia, enacted expressly in execution of the treaty,

and strictly enjoining the observance of its stipulatibns HU!NTEUR'S
with good faith and, therefore, thesaid patent conveys 1ESSEE.
no title to the Defendant in error.
1. Upon the first point they'relied upon the'expregs
words of the grant., from the crown to the original patentees, and the following cases 2, Wash. 113, Picket

Curry 'v. Burns-, Wash. 34, Birch v. ,Alexander-anl
2, Dall. 99, .XICurdy v. Potts.
2. The estate, bv the devise, vested in Denny Fairfax, who continued to hold the same till the treaty of
peace. Although an alien-pnemy, lie could take and
hold until office.found. The law is perfectlysettled
that an alien can take by purchase, although lie cannot take by descent. In this respett there is no differ.
en'e between an alien enemy and avalien friend. He
took a fee simple subject to the right of the so-vereign
to seize it. Co. Lit. 2, (b)-5, Co. 52, .Page's case-9.
Co. 141 (a)-2, Bl. Corn. 293, Powell on,apv. 316-2,
Vent. 270.
It is essential to the Plaintiffs title that the -state
should have vested in Denny Fairfax, for if itdid not,
it could not escheat to the commonwealth under .wloea
the Plaintiff claims.
It is one of the principles of the common law, upon
which the security of private property from the grasp
of power depends, that the crown can take only by matter
of record. 3, BL. Com. 259. Those authorities which
-.ay an alien may take, but cannot holtd, clearly mean
that he cannot hold agamnt the claim of the crown asserted in a legal manner-Co. Lit. 2, a 4-.b. An alien
may suffri- a common recovery-Goldsb.102.4, Leon, 82.
Bro. tit. Denizen and .lien, 17 And it is expressly
laid down that only the tenant of the freehold can suffer a common recovery-3, Bl. Coin. 356-7 But he
could not be tenant of the fi'eehola unless the estate
vested and remained in him-i, Bac. ab. 133. The case
of an alien purchasing and being afterwards made a

lands be forfeitable they descend. This could not be

the estate will survive upon the death of the alien, unless office be found, consequently the estate remained
in the alien until his death. It is expressly decided in

In this case no office was found, nor any equivalent
act done to vest the estate in the commonwealth before

'This manifests no intention to confiscate. On the contrary by making the entries for lands in the Northern

The treaty of peace then found the freehold of the
land in Denny Fairfax.
3. That treaty released the forfeiture and no subsequent act of the legislature could affect the title.
The 5th article engages that CDngress shall earnestly
recommend the restoration of confiscated estates, and
the 6th article stipulates that "cno further confiscation
shall be made."
The term "'coifiscation" embraces every case of the
money or estate of an individual, brought'into the treasury in virtue of any forfeiture, and ii this sense it is
generally used in treaties. Cowell Tit. confiscation, 1.

have been wholly nugatory There was no provision,
in the treaty, to protect restored estates, but the prohibition of future confiscations contained in the 6th artitle.
If in one case the term, coiftscatibu, in that article,
meant confiscation by reason of that alienage which
was the consequence of the part taken in the war, why
not give it the same meanug in all cases of alienage
arising from the same cause ? Denny Fairfax became
an. alien by reason of the part he took i,the war. He
chose to take part with Great Britain, and thereby became an alien, whereby .ns land became liable to confiscation according to the laws of Virginia. Whether
the confiscation was to be mediately or immediately the
consequence of the part taken in the war, was iminaterial. It would have been a ffidure confiscation by
reason of the part taken by him in the war." A'ny
ssequent act of confiscation therefore by the state of

1. As to the nature of lord Fairfax's title to the waste
and unappropriated lands.
This title was not that or a common subject. It was
a grant by the crown, of the same right to dispose of the
lands which the sovereign had. It was a right to grant
the lands to individuals, and to receive the services and
quitrents due therefor. It was not contemplated that
lie himself should occupy the lands. It was a mere
delegation of a part of the suvereign power, and so far
as it was executed by him, it passed, with the other
rights of sovereignty, to the commonwealth of Virginia,
at the time of the revolution.

SUPREME COURT U, S:
SxnRuAx's This %vasthe construction -put upon it by lord Fair. fax himself-for when he intended to appropriate any
,DEvIsE
.T.
part of the lands to his own use, he granted it to a third
nuuTx's person, and then took back the title frbm his own granLESSEE. tee. His deeds were not in the common form, but were
made to resemble those of the crown.
The Defendants in error still contend that there is a
difference between an alien friend and an alien enemy,
as to the right to hold lands. In the latter case an office is not nece.ssary The right and possession aro
-both thrown upon the commonwealth.
3. But the principal question is, what effect had the
treaty of peace upon this devise?
It is said that the proiision, that no future confiscations should be made, removea the disability of alienage.
The itle ofthe comknonwealti of Virginia was complbte before the treaty of peace. Nothing more was
necessary than to 'pursue the legal proceedings to put
,the state into possesswn. The office is no part of the
title. This was complete at the death of lord Fairfax.
It vested eo tastanti in the commonwealth. If it passel
to Denny Fairfax, it was to the use of the commonwealth- But if any title vested in Denny Fairfax, what
kind of title was it? It could not descend from him.
Upon bis death the right and possession were cast upon
the commonwealth. He h~td no beneficial interest. He
was only a tt ustee of an ectate at will-Co. Lit. 2, (b,)
Plowd. 229. An office is only a suit brought bv the
king to establish his title by proof of the facts upon
which his title depends. It is not to grve title, but to
prove the fact of alienage. The office is the remedy,
not the right. It is only the means of gain )ossesou in. Attornment to an alien is an attornment to the
use of the king-Co. Lit. 310, (b.)

thing but a nated possession. It is said lie is a good
tenant to the precipe, and may suffer a common recovery, but it is for the use of the king.
The treaty of peace does not protect the title

If this be not the generdi'meaning of the. word ,, confiscation," it is the meaning of it as used in the treaty
The contracting parties were speaking of the acts of the
state governments wich were intended as punishments
for the part which certain persons had taken in the war.
The estates to be restored were not such as had escheat..
ed by reason of alienage, but such as had beefi confiscated on account of the part taken in the war.
If the title was not protected by the treaty, then upon the death of Denny Fairfax it vested completely in
gie, commonwealth.
The Faurfax title was extinct.
The commonwealth was estopped by its deed from claiming it, .o that the title of Hunter was unquestionable.
As to the 9th article of the treaty of 1794, Denny
Fairfax could continue to hold only what he then held,
and as lie then held. If lie held any thing, it was, at
most, an estate for life, remainder to the commonwealtli
in fee defeasible, durihg his life, by office found. Consequently, at lis death, the commonwealth bad an estate
in fee. The treaty of 1791 was intended to protect
those only who became aliens, by the separation of the
two countries, while they held the estates, and not those
who were aliens when their estates accrued. Ifit'had intended to protect the latter class, it would have protected
estates acquired by descent as well as those acquired by
devise for they are both within thc same reason, yet it
cannot be said that an alien, who, but for his alienag.e,
would have inherited an estate upon a descent cast before 1794, is benefitted by that treaty. It cannot be said
that lie then held the estate of his ancestor which his alienage had prevented from descending upon hin.

STORY, J. delivered their opinion as follows, (MAi1sHatiL Ch. J.'and TODD J. bezng absent.)

ituNTER's

The first question is, whether lord Fairfax was proproprietor of, and seized of the soil of the waste and
unappropriated lands in the Northern Neck, by virtue
of the royal grants, 2 Charles, 2 and 4 James 2, or
whether he had mere seignoral rights therein as lord
paramount, disconnected from all interest in the land,
except of sale or alienation.

.EssE ..

The royal charter expressly conveys all that entire
tract, territory, and parcel of land, situate, &c. together with the rivers, islands, woods, timber, &c. mines,
quarries of stone and coal, &c. to the grantees and
their heirs and assigns, to their only.use and behoof,
and to no other use, intent or purpose Whatsoever.
It is difficult to conceive terms more explicit than
these to vest a title and interest in the soil itself. The
land is given, and the exclusive use thereof, and if the
union of the title and the exclusive use do not constitute
the domnnum directun. k utile, the complete and absolute dominion in property, it will not be easy to fix
any which shall constitute such dominion.
The grouid of the objection would seem to have been,
that the royal charter had declared that the grantees
should hold of the kin- as tenants vt capite, and that it
proceeded to declare that the grantees and their heirs
and assigns should have power ", freely and without mo,lestation of the king, to give, grant, or by any ways
' or means sell or alien all and singular the granted
s, premises, and every part and parcel thereof, to any
,, person or persons being willing to contract for and
ii buy the same," which words were to be considered as
restrictive or explanatory of the preceding words of
the charter, and as confining the rights granted to the
mere authority fo sell or alien.
But it is very clear that this clause imposes no restriction or explanation of the general terms of the
grant. As the graitees held as tenants in capite of the
king, they could nt sell or alien without the royal li.
cense. and if they did, it was in ancient strictness an

absolute forfeiture of the land.

2 ins. 66 , and after FAIRFAx's
the statute I Edw. 3 ch. 12, though the forfeiture did DEVISEE
not attach, yet a reasonable fine was to be paid to the
v.
king upon the alienation. 2 Ins. 67 Staindf.Prer 27 nuxrn's

charter, (12 Ch. 2 ch. %,) that all fines for. alienations
and tenures of the king t capite were abolished, 2 B1.
Com. 77 So that the object of this clause was mamfestly to give the royal assent to alienations without the
claim of any fine tlerefor.
We are therefore satisfied, that by virtue of the
charter and the intermediate grants, lord Fairfax
at ie time of his death, had the absolute property of
the soil of the land in controversy, ana the acts of ownership exercised by him over the whole waste and unappropriated lands, as -,tted in the case, vested in him a
completc scizin and possession thereof. Even if there
had been no acts of ownvrshi) proved, we should have
been of opinion, that as tnere was no adverse possession,
and tne land was waste and unappropriated, the legal
seizin must be, upon principle, considered as passing
with the title.
On this point we have the satisfaction to find, that.
our view of the title of lord Fairfax seems incidentally
confirmed by the opinion of the Court of appeals of VirgM-ma, in Picket -v. Dowdell, 2 Wash. 106. Johnson 'v.
Buffington, 2 Wash. 1Â±6, and Curry v. Burns, 2 Mash.
121.
The next question is as to the nature and character of
the title which Denny Fairfax took by the will of lord
Fairfax, lie being, at the time of the death of lord Fairfiax, an alien enemy
It is clicar by the common law, that an alien can take
lands by purochase, though not by descent, or in other
words he cannot take by the act of law, but lie may by
the act of the party This principle has been settled in
the year books, and has been uniformly recognized as
sound law from that time. i Hen. -, 26. Us,, Hen. 4,

Sheafe v. O'.Neile, 1 Jfass. Rep. 256. Though Co. Litt.

that lie can convey a defeasible estate only, which an
office found will divest. It seems indeed to have been
held, that an alin cannot maintain fi real action for the
recovery of lands. Co.Lit. 129 b. T hel. Dig. ch. 6. Dyer, 2. b. but it does not then follow that he may not de'fend, in a real action, hIs title . the lands against all
persons but the sovereign.
We do not find that in respect to these general rights
and.disabilities, there is any admitted difierene between
alien fi-rnds and alien enemies. During the war, the
property of alien enirms~is subject to confiscation 3ure
bei, and their civil capacity to sue is suspended. Dyer,

It has not been attempted to place the title of Denny
Faitrfax upon the ground of nis being an antenatus,born
tinder a common allegiance before the American revolution, and this has been abandoned upon good reason,
for whatever doubts may have been formerly entertained. it is now settled that a British subject born before,
cannot, sice the revolution, take lands by descent in the
united States. 4 (ranch, 321, Dawson's Lessee v. Godfirey.
But it has been argued$ that although D. Fairfax

of the testator, lord Fairfax, the title vested in the
.commonwealth, and left but a mere naked possession in
the devisee.
If we are right in the position, that thc capacity of an
alien enemy does not differ in this respect from an alien
friend, it will not be easy to maintain this argument. It
is incontrovertibly settled upon the fullest authority
that the title acquired by an alien by purchase, is not
divested ilit office found. The principle is founded upon the ground, that as the freehold is in the alien, and
he is tenant to the lord of whom the lands are holden,
it cannot be divested out of him but by some notorioun
act, by which it may appear that the freehold is in another. I Bac. .tbr .Alien C.p. 133. Now an office of entitling is necessary to give this-notoriety, and fix the title in the sovereign. So it was adjudged m Page'scase

67 Park. 1%4. Hob. !231. Bro. Denzev, pl. 17
Co. Litt. 2. b. And the reason of the difference, why
when an alien dies, the sovereign is seized without office found, is because otherwise the freehold would be in
abeyance, as an alien cannot have any inheritable blood.
Nay even after office found, the king is not adjudged in
possession, unless the possession were then vacant, for
if the possession were then in another the king must
enter or seize by his officer,. before the possession in
deed shall be adjudged in him. i, H. 7, 21. 15 H. 7, 6.

And if we were to yield to the authority of Staundford.
(Prer Reg. ch. 18, p. 56,) that in the case of alien enemy, the king ",ratione guerrae," might seize without offiee found, yet the same learned authority assures us.
-,that the king must seize in those cases, ere lie can
have ai siterest in the lands, because they be penal towards the party." 4 Co. 58. b. And until the king be

SUPREME COURT U. S.
r.i=iAx's To apply these principles to the present case, Denny
ni3vis.u Fairfax had a complete, though defeasible title, by virV.
tue of the devise, and as the possession was either vaHUN'rTrn's cant or not adverse, of gourse the law united a seizin to
LL sssr
his title in the lands in controversy, and this title
could only be divested by an inquest of office, perfected
by an entry and seizure where the possession was not
vacant. And no grant by the commonwealth, according
to the common law, could be valid, until the title was,
by such means, fixed in the commonwealth. Itis admitted that no entryor s -izure was made by the commonwealth ;;ratione gterrae" during the war. It is also
admitted, that no inquest of office was ever made pursuant, to the acts on this subject at any time. And it
wohll seem therefore to follow, upon common law reas%.ruig, that the grant to. the lessor of the original Plaintiff. by the public patent of 30th April, 1789, issued improvidently and erroneously, and passed nothing. And
if this be true, and there he. no act of Virginia altering
thw common law, it is quite immaterial what is the valh ity of the title of jjie original Defendant as against
tl e commonwealth, for the Plaintiff must recover by
the streuilh of his own title, and not by the weakness
of that of his adversary
But it is contended, 1st, That the common law as to
inquests of-office and seizui e, so far as the same respects
the lands m controversy, is completely dispensed with
by statutes of the commonwealth, so as to niake the
qrant to the original Plaintiff in 1789 complete and perfrct-And secondly, and further, if it be not so, vet as
the devisee died pending the suit, the freehold was thereby cast upon the commonwealth without an inquest, and
thus arises a retroactih e confirmation of the title of the.
origial Plaintiff, of which lie may now avail himself.,As to the first point we will not say that it was not
competent for the legislature, (supposing no treaty in
the wav) by a special act to have. vested the land in the
commonwealth without an inquest of office for the cause
of alienage. But such an effect ought not, upon principles of public policy, to be presumed upon light
grounds, that an inquest of office should be made in
cases of alienage, is a useful and important restraint
upon public proceedings. No part of the United States
seems to have been more aware of its impQrtance, or

FEBRUARY TERM

more cautious to guard against its abolition, than the 'AIRF.x'
Courts of Virginia. It prevents individuals from being DEVISEEn
V.
harassed by numerous suits fntroduced by litigious
grantees. It enables the owner to contest the question HUNTER'S
of alienage directly by a traverse of the office. It af- LESSE.
fords an opportunity for the public to know the nature,
the value, and the extent of its acquisitions pro defectu,
hwredis, and above all it operates as a salutary suppression of that corrupt influence which the avarice of speculation might otherwise urge upon the legislature. The
common law, therefore, ought not to be deemed to be
repealed, unless the language of a statute be clear and
explicit for this purpose.
Let us now consider the several acts which have been
referred to in the argument, from which we think it
will abundantly appear that, during the var, the lands
inontroversy were never, by any public law, vested in
the commonwealth. We dismiss, at -once, the act 6f
they are restrun1777, ch. 9, and of 1779, ch. i , ais
ed to estates held by British subjects at the times of'
their respective enactments, and do not extend to eat.ites
subsequently acquired.
The next act is that of 1782, ch. 8, the 24th sec. after
reciting that cc since the death of the late proprietor of
the Northern Neck, there is reason to suppose that the
said proprietorship hath descended upon alien enemies,"
enacts, that persons holding lands in said Neck, shall
retain sequestered in their hands, all quit rents which
were then due, -untilthe right of descent should be more
fidiy ascetained, and that all quit rents, thereafter to
become due, shall be paid into the public treasury, and
the parties exonerated from the future claim of the proprietor. Admitting that this section as to the quit
rents, was equivalent to an inquest of office, it cannot
be extended, by construction, to include the -waste lands
of the proprietor. Neither the words, nor the intention.
of the legislature would authorize such a constructionBut it may well be doubted if, even as to the quit rents,
the provision is not to e consid,-red as a sequestration
*7ure belli, rather than a seizure for alienage-for it proceeds on the ground, that the property ,,"had descended,
not upon aliens, but alien- enemies. So far as the.treaty
of peace might be deemed"material in the case, this distinction wopld deserve consideration,"

SUPREME COURT'U. S.
The next is the act of 1782, cn. 33, which, after re" the.death of lord Fairfax may occasion
T.
great inconveience to those who may incline to make
HUNTER'S entries for vacafit lands in the Northern Neck, proceeds
LEssEs. (see. 3.) to enact, that all entries made with the surveyors, &c. anit returned to the office formerly kept ity lord
Fairfax, shall be held as good and valid as those heretofore made under his direction, 6 until some mode shall
" be taken up and adopted by the General Assembly,
"cconcerning the territory of the Northern Neck." This
act, so far from containing in itself any provision for
vesting all the vacant lands of lord Fairfax in the commonwealth, expressly reserves, to a future time, all deciSions as to the disposal of the territory.-Itsuffers rights
-and titles to be acquired exactly in the same manner,
and with the same conditions, which lord Fairax had
by permanent regulations prescribed in his office.-No
other acts were passed on the subject during the war.
&A1UFAx's

DvEvsER citing that

We are now led to consider the act ofQI78, ch. 4j7wuch has presented some difficulty, if it stand unaffected
by the treaty of peace. The Ith sec. after a recital " that
"6since the death of the late proprietor, no mode hath
" been adopted to enable those who had before Ins
"6death made entries within the said district according
" to an act, &c. (act 1782, ch. 33) to obtain titles to the
" same," enacts that in all cases of such entries, grants
shall be issued by the commonwealth to the parties
in the same manner, as by law is directed in cases of
other unappropriated lands-The 5th sec. then declares
Chat the unappropriated land within 'the Northern Neck
should be subject t.,
the game regulations, and be granted in the same manner, and caveats should be proceeded
upon, tried and determined, as is by law directed, in
cases of other unappropriated lands belonging to the
commonwealth. The 6th sec. extinguishes for the future all quit rents.
The patent of the original Plaintiff issued pursuant
to the 5th sec. of this act.
It has been argued. that the act of 1785 amounts t6 k
legislative appropriation of all the lands in controversy
That it must be considered as completely divesting the
title of Ilen,,v Fairfax for the cause of alienage. and

FEBRUARY TERM isis.
vesting it in the commonwealth-After the. most mature -ATMr'Xi's
reflection, we cannot subscribe to the argument---In acts .EV sEE
of sovereignty so highly.penal, it is against the ordijia- '-.
ry rule to enlarge, by inpplication and inference, the ex- HUN 'J'a o
tent of the language employed. It.vould be to declare LTSSEE
purposes which the legislature have not chosen to avow,
and to create vested estates, when the common law
would pronounce a contrary sentence, and the guardians of the public interests have not expressed an intention to abrogate that-law. If the legislature have proceeded upon the suppositiQn that the lands were already vested in the commonwealth, wa do not perceive
how it helps the case. If the legislature, upon a mistake
of facts, proceed to grant defective titles, we know df
no rule of law which requires a Court to declare, in
penal cases, that to be actually done which ought previously to have been done. Perhaps-as to grants under
the 4th sec. where entries under the act of 1782, ch. 33,
it might not be too much to hold, that such grants conveyed no more thai the title of the commonwealth, exactly inthe same state as the commonweath itself held
it, viz. an inchoate right, to be reduced into possession
and consummated by a suit in the nature, or with the
effect, of an inquest of office. Blut we give no opinion Qn
this point, because the .patent of. the original Plaintiff
manifestly Issued under the succeeding section--and upon -a construction, which we give to- this- section,- it issued improvidently, and passed no title whatever.r-That
construction is, that the unappropriated- lands in the
Northern Neck should be granted inthe samemanner as
the other lands of the. commonwealth, when the title .of
the commonwealth was perfected by possession. It seems
to us difficult to contend, that the legislature meant to
.grant mere titles and rights of entry, of. the commonwealth, to lands in the same manner as it did lands of.
which the commonwealth was in actual possession antd
seizin:-It would be selling suits aul controversies
through the whole country, and enacting a general statute in favor of maintenance, an offence which the
common law has denounced with extraordinary severity.. Consistent therefore with the manifest intention
of the legislature, grants were to issue for'ands in the
'Northern Neck, precisely in the same manner as for
lanls in other parts of the state, and under the-same

HUNTER'S We are the more confirmed in this construction by
LESSEE. the act concerning escheators, (act 1779, cli. o5,) which
regulates the manner of proceeding in cases of escheat,
and was by a subsequent act.- (act 1786, ch. 53,) egpressly extended to the counties in the Northern Neck.
This act of 1779 expressly prohibits the granting- of
any lands, seized into the hands of the commonwealth
-uponoffice found, till the lapse of twelve months after the
return of.the inquisition and verdict into the office of the
general Court, and afterwards authorizes the proper escheator to proceed. to sell in case no claim .should he
liled, within that time, and substantiated against the
commonwealth. It is apparent, from this act, that it
was not the intention of the legislature to dispose of
lands, accruing by escheat, in the same manner as
lands to which the commonwealth already possessed a
perfect title. It has not been denied that the regulations of this act were designed to apply as well to titles
accruing upon alienage, (wicr, are not 'in strictness,
escheats,) as upon forfeitures for other causes, and, but
for the act of 1785, cli, 47, we do not peFceive- but that
the vacant lands were, by the devise of lord Fairfax, in
the Nbrthern Neck, would have been completely witbi
the act regulating proceedings upon escheats.
The real fact appears to have been, that the legisla '
lure supposed that the commonwealth were in actual
seizin and possession of the vacant lands of lord Fairfax, either upon the principle that an alien enemy could
not take by devise, or the belief that the acts of 1782,
ch. 8, and ch . 33, had already *estd the property in the
-tommonwealth. In either case it was a mistake which
surely ought not to be prssed to the injury of third perSOILS.

Bti if the construction, wich We have suggested, be
incorreot, we think that, at all events, the title of Hunter, under the grant of .1789, cannot be considered as
more extensive than the title of the commonwealth, vii.

Tis view of the acts of Virginia, rendeyrs it wholly :ui:FAx's
unnecessary to consider a point, which has been very DEvIs.E
T.
elaborately argued at the bar, whether the 'treaty of
peace, which declares" "-that no future confiscations HiUTx.R'S
shall be made," protects from forfeithre, under the mum- ESSEE.
cipil laws respecting alienage, estates held by British
subjects at the time of the ratification of that treaty.,
For we are well satisfied that tile treaty of 1791 completely protects and confirms the title of Denny Fairfaxz
even admitting that the treaty of peace left im wholly
unprovided for.

The 9th article is in these-words: " It is agreed that
British subjects who now hold lands in the territories,
of the United States, and American citizens who now
hold binds in the dominions of )is majesty, shall continue to hold them according to the nature and tenure
of their respective estates and titles therein, and may
grant, sell or devise the same to whom they please in
like manner as if they were natives, and that neither
they nor their heirs'or assigns shall, so far as-respects
the said lands and the legal remedies incident t!iereto,
be ponsidered as aliens."
Now, we cannot yield to the argument that Denny
Faifax had, no title, bnt a mere naked possession or
trust estate. In our judgment, by virtue of the devise
to lnm, he held a fee simple in his own right. At the
time of the commencement of this suit (in 1791) he was
in complete possession and seizin of the land. That
possession and seizin continued-up 'to and after the treaty of i791, which being the supreme law of tile land.
confirmed the title to him, his heirs and assigls, am!
protected lm from any forfeiture by reason of alienage.
It was once in the power of the commonwealth of Virginia, by an inquest of office ur its equivalent, to have
vested the estate completely in itself or its qrantee
But it has noc so done, and its own inchoate title (and
of course the derivative title, if any, of its. grantee) has
by the operation of the treaty become ineffectual and
vold.
It becomes unnecessary to consider the argument as
to tile effect of the death .fDenny Fairfax pending the

dissent from the opinion of the majority of my brethren.
The material questions are,
1st. Whether an alien can take lands as a devisee,
and if he can,
2d. Whether an inuquest of office was indispensably
necessary to divest hiniof his interest for the benefit of
the state?
3d.-Whether the disability of the devisee was-not creid
by the treaty of peace3 or the treaty of 1794.
-With regard to the treaty of peace it is verylear to
me that, that does not affect the case. The words of the
4th article are, - TLhere shall be no future confiscations
9-made, nor any presecution commenced against any
,,person or persons for or by reason of the part which
"he or they may have taken in the present war."
Now shonld we admit, as has been strongly insisted,
that to escheat is to confiscate, it would'still remain to
show that this was ,;a confiscation on account ,of the
,,part taken by the devisee in the war of the revolu"-tro." But the diability of an alien to hold real
estate is the risilt of a general principle. of.the common
'law, and was in no wise attached to the individual on
account of his conduct in the revolutionary struggle.

cure tile individual from legal punishment-not to cure
a legal disability-.existing in him.
With regard to the bearing of the treaty of 1794, on
the interests of the parties, the only difficulty arises
from the vague signification of the words "now holding," made use of in the article which relates to this
subject., But in. conformity with the liberal spirit in
which national contracts ought to be construed, I am
satisfied to consider that treatv as extending to all cases
" of a rightful pussession or legal title defeasible only
" on the ground- of alien disability and existing at the
", date of that treaty"
What then were the rights of the devisee in this case?
and were they in existence at the date of this trvaty'
Wloevfr looks into the learning, on the cap "ityof
an alien to take lands as devisee, will find it involved
in some difficulties. There is no decided case, that I
knriw of, upon the subject. And the opinions of learned
men upon it, when compar'd, will be found to have
been expressed with doubt,'or scarcely reconcileable to
each other. The general rule is, that an alien may
take by purchase, but cannot hold. Yet so fragile or
gimsy is the right lie acquires, that, if tortiously dispossessed, no one contends that hm can-maintain an action
aganist the evictor. To assert that he has a righi, and
yet admit-that he has no remedv, appears to me rather
paradoxical., Yet all admit that the bailiff of the king

view the interest may be said to be cast onthe alien by
operation of law. Yet I have no hesitation in deciding
in favor of the doctrine as laid down by Powell. Not
on the words of lord Hardwick, as quoted from A'mnglt
and & .Pless7s, for the judge there expressly declifies

The only unexceptionable reason that can be assigned why -an alien can take by deed, though lie cannot
hold, is, That otherwise the proprietor would be restricted in hi's choice of an alienee, or in other words, in his
right of alieiiation. And to declare suwh a conveyance
null and void would be attended with this absurdity,
that the estate would still remain in the alienor in opposition to his own will and contract. It would therefore seem that the law on this subject would be more
satifactorily expressed by asserting that an alien is a
competent party to a contract, so that a conveyance, executed to hum, shall divest the feoffer or donor, in order
that it may'escheat. The tendency of this doctrine to
favor the royal prerogative of escheat, would no doubt
secu'e to it a welcome reception, yet it is not too much
to pronounce it reasonable in the abstract. This reason is 'as applicable to the case of a devise as of. a contract, aid in the technical-application of the terrm purchaser a devisee is included. But it is contended that
the grant to lord Fairfax was a grant or cession of
sovereign power, and as such was assumed by the state
when it declared itself independent. Upon considering,
as well the acts of fhe state, with regard to this property, as the acts of lord Fairfax himself, there is reason
i)o think that both acted under this impression. But to
decide on this question, we must look into the deed of
cession, and upon its construction the decision of this
Court must depend. And here, in every part of it, we
find it divested of the chief attributes of sovereigntynot , power legislative, .judicial or executive given, and

under the devise was a mere scintilla,jurzs, and that

I am of opinion that whenever the case, made out in
the pleadings9 does not, in law, sanction the judgment
which has been given upon it, the error sufficiently appears upon the record to bring the case within the XXV
section of thejudiciary act.

ram also of opinion that whenever a case is brought
up to this Court under that section, the title of the parties litigant must necessarily be enqired into, and that
such an enquiry must, in the nature of, things, precede
the consideration how far the law, treaty, and soforth, is
applicable to it, otherwise an appeal to this Court
would be worse than nugatory
And that n ejectinent at least, if n6t in every possible
