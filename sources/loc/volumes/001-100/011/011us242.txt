he states what acts lie did inrelation to his office, and'
reasons from them in his exculpation. 2. Because the

it does not state the nature and circumstances of error
or mistake supposed to be made by his said clerks and
assistants, so as to show that it did not proceed from a
want of reasonable care and diligence.

*. Because the

plea amounts to the general issue. 5. Because it does
not set forth any matter of law proper for the decision

To this replication the Defendant demurred.

V.

MUNROEd

All the demurrers were decided by the Court below
in favor of the Plaintiffs.
Upon the trial of the issues of fact the Plaintiffs took
seven bills ofexception.
1. The fir~t bill of exception stated that the Plaintiffs
offered evidence to the jury that the Defendant was
deputy post-master at the city of Washington from the
ist of January, 1806, until the time of trial, and had
uniler his management and 'direction the affairs and
business of the post-office at that place; and the Plaintiffs produced and read to the jury the printed instructions of the post-master general of the United States:
and proved bjr a witness that those were the instructions delivered.to the Defendant for his government in
the duties of his office as deputy post-master in the city
of Washington. The.Plaintiffs further produced to the
jury evidence that they had . 2,000 in bank notes in
the hands of Walker and Kennedy, merchants at Philadeiphia, and that that sum of money, in bank notes,
was enclosed in a sealed letter and directed to the Plaintiffs, at Petersburgh in Virginia, the place of their residence, and put into the post-office at Philadelphia, and
was by the post-master at that place forwarded in the
mail addressed to the state of Yirginza on the S1st of
July, 1806. That it arrived in due course of post at the
post-office in the city of Washington under the care and
management of the Defendant. That it was the duty
of the -office at Washington, as a distributing office, to
open the said mail so addressed, and to forward t6 Petersburgh in Virginia the said letter according to its
address. That the said letter was lost and never arrived
at the post-office in Petersburgh nor came to the hands
of the Plaintiffs, and that the same was demanded of
the Defendant, who denied lie was liable for it. It was
admitted that the course of conveying the mail from
Philadelphia to Petersburgh is as follows: the Virginia
mail, tied witha string and wrapt in papers, is, with
many other mails similarly secured, enclosed in a locked portmanteau, and sent by stage to the city of WashIngtoh, distant 141 miles. No person or post-office between Philadelbhia and Washington is legally autho-

FEBRUARY TERM i8i2.
rized to open the mail addressed to Virginia, but the
portmanteau is unlocked and opened at the Baltimore
post-office, and the various mails are there taken out of
the portmanteau, in order to select the Baltimore mail.
Whenthe mail arrives at the post-office in Washington
the mailaddressed to Virginia is opened in said office
as a distributing office, and the letters addressed to Petersburgh assorted, tied and wrapped as aforesaid, and
put into a mail addressed to the post-office at Petersliubgh. tThe said Petersburgh mail so tied and wrapped
is, with many other tnairs, put into the portmanteau,
which'is locked and opened on the route only at Fre.
dericksburgli and Richmond. But the said Petersburgh
mail, wrapped in paper and tied with a string as aforesaid, though it may properly-he taken out of the portmanteau with the other mails at Fredericksburgh and
Richmond as aforesaid, cannot be legally opened at any
office between Washington and Petersburgh. Whereupon the Plaintiffs' counsel prayed the Court to instruct
the jury, that if they should find the above facts to be
true the Pliintiffs were entitled to recover in this cAse
on their td count, unless the Defendant should prove
the said letter to have, been forwarded from his office in
the timne and manner prescribed by law and the said instructions of the post-master general, which opinion the
Court refused to .ive.
2. The,2d bill of exceptions stated the same facts,
and that thereupon the Plaintiffs' counsel prayed the
Court to instruct the jury that if they should find those
facts to be true, then the Plaintiffs were entitled to recover inthis case upon their %thand 5th counts, unless
the Plaintiff should prove the said letter to have been.
forwarded from his office i reasonable time, and in the
manner prescribedby law and the instructions of the
post-master general, which instruction thi Court refused to give.
3. The 3d bill of exception stated, that, in addition
to the above facts, the Plaintiffs offered evidence, undei
the issues joined on the 6th and iOth pleas, to prove
that the letter and bank notes were lost by the negligence and carelessness of Henry Whetcroft and William
Hewitt sworn clerks and assistants employed by the
Defendant in his said post-office; and also certain acts

cd the. jury that tbe Defendant Was not liable.-under
those'ssups for any acts or-onjissions of his said clerks
and assistants, -to -which.refusal. ai opinion the Plaintiffs excepted.
b., The 4th bill of-exceptions stated that the -Plaintiffs
oflered evidence of the facts stated in their 5th and 8th
conntq, and moved the Court to instruct the jury that
if they should'bolieve fi-om tho evidence that -the letter
9nd bank notes were dulv/delivred into the-Defendantis
post-oflloe,- then.it was. incumbent on -the -Defendant to
prove that.the same-were duly forwarded. And -if the
Jury should-further believe that the -same were not so
forwarded and-had becotne lost, then it was incumbent
on tihe Defendant to prove that the same were not 4ost
by any, undue negligence -or unreasonable detention -of
himself or any person employed by him -in his -offie-;
which instruction the Court refuse4 -to give, but -instructed them that if the jury should believe from the
oidence that the letter and bank notes were duly deli,rcd into the Defendant's office, then it was incumbent.
On-the'Defendant io 0iÂ¢ove that the same were duly forwarded, and if the jury should further believe-that the
same. wereso delivered and were-not-so, forwarded, and
had bepomne-lost tnconsequence iliereofi then it was incunfbent on the Defendant toprove that the same -were
not lost by any undue negligence and unreasonable detention of himself or any other person employed by him
in his office. To -which refusal the Plaintiffs excepted.
5. The. Bth bill of exceptions stated, in addition-tothefact. before stated, that the -Plaintiffs offered -in evideiie..a copy of a. post-bill from P-hiladelphia, of the
"At of July, 4806, (shewing that a letter whose posie was.qne dollar and 20 cents. corresponding -with
the .potage upon the letter m 4tuestion, was -charged in

and'offered to prove -thatthq..post-bill, of whch it was a nui~l

copy, was received at the "Defendants post-office with
letters in -the-mail from Philadelphia. And the Defen- mvwto,,

-dant offered evidence to pr'ove that it never was the.---.-..

custom, until after the report ofthe loss of the letter and
banknotes in.question, for the actwiu contents of the-mails,
sent to the said office for distribution, to'b compared
with the contents noted sit the accoimpanyngpost-bilaj 'except that it was customary to examine the column of
paid letters in order to see whether as many paid letters,
and of the same amount of postage, caine on ii.theinail)
that this was done because the deputy post-master had
to account to -the post-master geneyal for all letters
sent on fromIns office and marked paid, whether orxgi
nally'put into lnq office, or coming there in mails for
distribution , and according to the routine of office, any'
deficiency, appearing o.n the arrival of the mail, in the
alnount of postage marked i his post-bill as c"paid,"
would be chargeable to him, that xi no other respect
was any attention paid, or notice taken, whether -the
actual contents of the mail, as to any lettefs not marked
;c paid," corresponded, or not, with the post-bill. That.
if, by accident, any variance between the post-bill and
the actual contents of the mail received for distribution,
was discovered, it would never be noted in the office,
inasmuch as the printed forms, furnished to the Defendant and.other deputy post-masters, from the post-master general for the account of'mailsfor distribution, contained no column for noting letters either over-charged,
or under-charged or miss-sent, such as are to be found
in the form furnished for account of mails for deliery,
and marked No. 1, in the schedule annexed to the instructions of 1801.
Whereupon, the Plaintiffs prayed the Court to in-.
struct the jury that if they b~lieved from the evidence.
that the copy of the post-bill produce i was a true copy
of the post-bill sent on from Philadelphia to the Washington post-office, and that the salne was received with
letters in the mail from Philadelpha at the Defendants
office, then the jury ought to presume that the-letters
accompanying the said post-bill corresponded thereNrith,

6. Tbe 6th exception was to the refusal of the Courf
to suffer a witness to be asked whether the printed general instructions from the post-waster general given to
the deputy post-masters in 180, superseded those before
given to the post-master in Philadelphia in 1800, both
instructions having been produced and read in evidence
to the jury.
7., The 7th bill of exceptions stated that the Plaintiffs
offered evidence to "-prove the several allegations in the
66 said declaration, and further offered in evidence the
,6several printd instructions of the post-master gend'eral (thereto annexed) and also the depositions (there" to annexed and which tended to prove the delivery of
-the letter and bank notes into' the post-office at Phila"delpbia and their arrival at the post-officq in Wash"ington.) And the Defendant offered evidence to prove
"that ,Petersburgh, ever since the Ist of Noveniber,
"(1801, was a distributing post-office as established by
"the said instructions, that after the said instructions
"it was the practice of post-offices, (except that of
"'Philadelphia) in which letters were deposited fot- Peoctersburgh, to put the same up in a separate mail ad-6 dressed to Petersbugh, and not in the Yirgima state
"mail.
That the Philadelphia post-offi~e, since the
"'said Ist of August, 1806, and not before, has adopted
66 the same practice. That the Virginia state mail above
" mentioned contained the letters directed .to the several
"post-offices in Virginia, except Norfolk and RichmondI
"and also the letters directed to the states Qf Ohio and
"Kentucky, and that before the letters for Petersbugh
"contained in the said mail could be distributed and
"re-mailed, it was necessary to assort and distribute the
,whole contents of the said mail.
"The Plaintiffs then moved the Coirtto instruct theju"ry, thatif they should believe from the evidence, thatthe

"the duty of the said Defendant to have re-mailed, dis,tributv, and sent on the said letter by the mail which

"was not so done, or caused to'be done by the said De"fendant, that it is incumbent on the Defendaut to make
"out a just, reasonable and sufficient excuse for the

gi~e as prayed, and the Plaintiffs excepted.
The a6t of congress of Marchl2d, 1799, Vol.4, p. SOB,
establishes a general post-office at the seat of government of the United States, under the direction of a postmaster general, and enacts. that'li shall establish potoffices, and appoint post-masters, at all such places as

tioes arose lipon the issues joindd on the 6th and flth "Duxxow
V.
pleas. Tile 6fh plea was, that the letter was not lost
by the ncgligenco.br misconduct of the Defendant in-hrs Muimo..
office-arid the ipth was, that the DVendant had not
,negligently or improperly delayed or detained the letter
in the officei
Tile law in respect to the liability- of, the post-Taoter
general is admitted to be the same here as itis stated in
Ld. le Despencer's,case, cCoiop. 754.) to be in'nglaud.
But the opinion of lord .Mfansfield,9 in that.case, clearly
shows that the action lies i' the present case. In the
case of Brker v. Fromont, 6 T. R. 659, it is decided
that a declaration which charges the Defendant wih negligence, is stipported by proof of the negligence of his
servant. Where tlhp negligence is in a post-ofilbe, it is
scarcely possible, in any case, for a Plaintiff to know
exactly to which of the persons, employed in the officej
the. negligence is to be attributed. If, as the Courtbe.low decided, the Defendant is liable for the negligence
of his cler'ks, it seems to be immaterial whether the 'declaration state the neglect to be on the part of the DefenZhnt or of his clerks, or state it in the alternative. A
collector of the revenue is liable for his deputies, although thoy are sworn officers. Yet the secretary of
the treasury it not liable for the collectors. -So the
marshal is liable for his deputies, who are-also sworn
officers, and who give bond for the faithful discharge
of their duty Why should there be a difference in the
case of a post-master ?
The 4.th exception is, that the Court refused to instruct the jury, that proof of negligence and loss
raised a presumption that the loss was a consequence
of the negligence, unless the contrary be shown. Or,
in other words, the Court below decided, that proof.of
neglience and loss (lid not throw the burden of proof
on the defendant, to show that the loss was not a consequence of the negligence. To oblige the Plaiitiffs to
prove, that the loss was a consequence of that negligence, was to impose upon them an impossibility in the
nature of things.
The 5th exception is to the refusal of the Court to
instruct the jury, that they ought to ifer that the con35

SUPiEME COURT U. 0.
DuNuop tents of the mail from Philadelphia corresponded with

the post-bill when it was received at the Washington
munoe . office, unless -the Defendant should prove the contrary.
What Ajury may infer from facts proved, is a question of law for the Court to decide. And what a jury
may thus infer, they are bound tn law to infer, unless
the contrary be proved. The Court, therefore, ought
not to have left the matter entirely to the jury, but to
have given the instruction as prayed.
Presumptions are inferences of law. Thus from long
possession, the Court will instruct the jury that they
ought to presume a deed. So from evidence of payment
of the last ten years rent, the jury ought'to presume all
the former rents were paid. So in trover, from evidence of a demand and refusal, the jury ought to
presume a conversion. So, if stolen goods are found
in possession of a man, the jury ought to presume that
lie stole them, unless the contrary be shewn.
The 7th exception raises the question whether the De1'endaxit was not bound to re-mail and send on the letter, according to law, and the instructions of the postmaster general, although the mail arrived at his office
in an irregular manner.
Upon this point the 5th section of the post-office law.
(-ol. 4, p. 5o7,) and the instructions, are decisive.
These instructions being given in conformity with the
law, become part thereof, and are equally binding.

All the questions in this case are resolved into one.
viz. On which side was the burden of proof in certain
stages of the trial. All the exceptions are grounded
upon the idea, that it was only necessary for,the Plain tiffs to show negligence in the oAce, and a loss, of th.
letter, without showing that the loss was a consequence
of the negligence.
We admit that the Defendant is liable for any loss
happemng by his own hegligence-but we deny that lie

is liable for that of his clerks. The act of Congress
requires that thte Defendant should employ clerks, and
that they should be sworn, and imposes specific penalties upon each person employed in the, office for his own
misconduct. They are all public officers, and-liable to
be charged ex delict offiii. The post-master is only
bound to use due care and circumspection in selecting
proper clerks. He is not like. a common carrier, who
receives hire in proportion to the risk, and the value of
the article. He has only a compensation for his troublein the office. The liability of a master arises from
Ins supposed assent, arising from the fact that the servant is employed for the benefit of the master. But
here the clerk does not act for the post-master, but for
the public. The servant must be employed in the business of the master and for his benefit, or the latter will
not be liable.

with the carrying of the mail.

The instructions from our post-master general to the
post-masters, that they should be liable for their deputies or clerk, &c. only means that they shall be liable in
accpmting with him officially foi the revenue. lie could
not make them liable to individuals.
In the case of hlownzvW v. Goodehild, 2 W B1. 906.
5 Ws. *13, the principal question was, whether the
post-master was bound to send out the letters to the inhabitants, but a question incidentally arose whether the
action, which was brought against the deputy post-master, should not have been brought against the post-master general. The Court, however, was of opinion, that
in all cases, deputies are answerable for their own personal misfeasance, such as detaining the letter in question. And in that case the deputies were made, by act
of parliament, ex necessitate rez, substantive officers,
and their duty pointed out as such.

showing that no such inference could be drawn as thPlainffls had supposed, and therefore the Court dld
right to'leave the whole to the jury.
The 7th excetmon required the Court to say, that the
Defendant as'bound to send on the letter on the ist of
August, or to show a reasonable excusq for not sending
it on, althoug, the mail was made up in an irregular,
manner in Philadelphia. The idea of reasonable diligence is.
excluded-and it supposes the Dfundant bQund
at all events to, send the letter on by tha. mail, or to
give a sufficient excuse for not doing so, although lie
sent it by the next mail, and althouob the loss was not
the consequence of not sending it on the ist of August.
The Defe.ndant w.is not bound to show that he sent it
on, it would be impossible in the course of the business
of the office to prove the sending on of every particular
letter. Sworn oflicers are presumed to have done their

OU the Judges being present,

follows

FEBRUARY TERM i812.
'Itis necssary~o dissipate the cloud of pleadifig in rDuNor'
Which this case is enveloped, in order to form a distinct
10.
'idea of'the quedtions intented to be brought to.the view muNoE.
of the Court below.
The object is to charge the post-master with the loss
of money sent by mail, and the points, which the exreptions are inTended to make are, how far he is liable
for his Q_ p4-or neglect, how.far. for the acts or neglect of his'assistants,, and what evidence shall be suffici.tnt.to support the Plaintiff's avtion.
, 'But unfdrtunately, as not unfrequently happens in
this complex and injudicious mode of conducting a suit,
with all the qlerical skill displayed by counsel in multiplying thew counts and pointing their bills of exceptipns, the pincipl questions are really, at last, not
brQught to the view of this Court.
On the ftrmt and second exception it is unnecessary
to make any remark, as they are admitted to apply to
counts which the evidence did not support and have
been, in fact, abandoned.
The third. exception is intended to raise the question
how far. a post-master is liable for the neglect ot his assistants, bR, connected with the leadings, it preseut&
another and a'very different question, to wit, whetfr,
when the issue is taken upon the neglect of the postmaster himself, it is competent to give in evidence, neglect in the assistant acting untler lm. Now the distinction between the relation of a -post-master to his
sworn *assistant acting under hih, and between master
-and servant generally, has long been settled, and althlough the-latter relation might sanction the admission
of Auch evidence, we are,unanimously of.opinion that,
if it is intended to charge a post-master for the negligence of his assistants, the pleadings must be made up
according tor the case; and his liability then will only
result fronm, his own neglect in not properly superintending the, discharge'of their duties in hus pffice.
In-the foufth excgption, the only difference between
the opinion prayed fdr and that given, is, that the Court

the letter described in the declaration. Now, in justico
V.
to the correctness of the.Plaintiffs' counsel, this Court
zuNRoB. hope that they meant nothing more than what the
Court conceded, for, certainly, if the loss was not a
consequence of the state of things made out in the evidence, they were not entitled to recover.

iDuNIoP

On the fifth exception it is only necessary to remark,
that if the Court below erred at all, it was in conceding
too much to the prayer of the Plaintiff. An entry on
the post-bill is by no means conclusive evidence of the
transmission of a letter, for, it may still never have
been put into the mail, or may have been stolen in its
pass ge.
The sixth exception is equally untenable. The instructions of the post-master general spoke for themselves. If the one superseded or rescinded the other,
the evidence was to-be sought for by comparing them
tot-ether.
And the seventh exception affords the Court an opportunity to remark how much more conducive to the
purposes of justice it would be to substitute special
verdicts, and demurrers.to evidence, for the tedious and
embarrassing practice of the Court from 'wich thi.9
case comes up.- It is a-fact that this bill .of exceptions
dlaims a right of recovery without stating any loss or
damage whatever. The opinion prayed for was, that
if the jury believed the various facts therein detailed,
then it is incumbent on the Defendant to make out a
3ust, reasonable and sufficient excOse for omitting to
forward the letter dscribed. But, unless an individuil has sustained some loss or damage by an omission
of that kind, why should the post-master be ,held to
.make out a defence? Each bill of exceptions must be
-oonsidered as presenting a distinct, substantive case,
and it is on the evidence stated in itself alone that the
Court is to decide. We cannot jo beyond it and collect other facs -which must have been in the min1 of
the party, and the Insertion of wich in this bill of exc.eptions could aloike have sanctioned the opinion as
prayed fnr
Upon the wholej the judgiumit below must be affirmed.
