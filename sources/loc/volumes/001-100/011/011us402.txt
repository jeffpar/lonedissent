in a state of blockade, and to enter it if it should not
be blockaded, hut if it should be blockaded, not to attempt to enter it, but to proceed to St.-Thomas's or Por
to Rico. That Amsterdam was a neighboring port to
Laguira, being distant about 147 miles. That Wxhen
she approached Amsterdam, being distant about 30
tiles, the master discovered a Briish vessel at the distance of 2 miles, whereupon he altered the course of
the schooner, and stood diroctly towards the British
vessel for the purpose of imuiring whether Amsterdam
was still in a state of blockade, that while so standing
for the British vessel, which was a frigate then actually
supporting the blockade of the port of Amsterdam, the
schooner was captured by the frigate and sent iito Samaica, and there condemned for breach of the blockade
of the port of Amsterdam, w-herebv she was wholly lost
to the Plauttiff. That on the 16th of May, 1805, the
Plaintiff having received intelligence of the capture.
abandoned the vessel in due time to the underwriters,
who refused to accept the abandonment.
That on the 27th of October, 1803, the government
of the United States made to the British government,
through its charge d'affiurs in the United States, a
representation on the subject of a blockade,.then recently notified, of the Islauds of' Martinique and Gaudalope;
which representation is set forth at large inthie bill of
exceptions, being a letter from -Mr. Madison, then Secretary of state, to Mr. Thornton, the British charge
d'affairs, dated the .07th of October, 1803.
That on the 5th of January I80!, thm British government, in consequence of that representation, issued an

That on the 12th of April, 180, the British government, by its minister plenipotentiary in the United States,
commtnicated the aforesaid order to the government of
the United States who caused it to be immediately published in the public newspapers.
That on the same 12th of Aprii, 1801, the said British
minister plenipotentiary officially mace known to the government of the United States, that the siege of the ishnd
of Curracoa had been convertedinto a blockade, which
communication was as follows

Washzngton, April 12th, 1804.
SIR,
I have the honor to acquaint you that I have just
received a letter from rear admiral, sir John Duckworth, comn;ander in chief or his majesty's squadron
at Jamaica, dated the second of last monti., in which he
desires me to communicate to the government of the
United States. that lie has found it expedient for Ins
majesty's service to convert the siege, which lie lately
attempted of Cilrracoa into a blockade of that Island.

FEBRUARY TERM 1813.
I cannot doubt, sir, that this blockade will be conduetd .ouforinably to the instructions which, (as I have
th. b ,nor to acq-.aint you in another letter of this date,)
have bt en recently sent on this subject, to the commander in chief of his majesty's forces, and to the judges of
the vice admiralty Courts in the West In(dies, shotild
the smallness of the Island of Curracoa still render necessary any distinction of the investment being confined
to particular ports.

That Travers, the master of the schooner William
and Malry,heard a report at Baltimore, before he sailed, that Amsterdam was in a state of blockade, and that
he was informed, before lie sailed from Baltimore, -by
the rupster of an American vessel, that about four months
before the time of giving that information, he arrived
with hits vessel near the port of Amsterdam, and there
met with a squadron of British ships of war then block- ading that port,. and was warned off by the commander
of the squadron, with his register endorsed in the usual
manner.
That Travers in the course of his voyage fell in with
a strong French squadron in lat. i5. loiig. 63. which
Was sailing westward. That the port of AmsterdaM is
in lat. 11 deg. 55 nun.-long. 68.
That while laying off Lagmra to endeavor to obtain
perm.5sion to enter the port, or to anchor his vessel, he
was informed by a merchant at Laguira, to whom lie
had been introduced by a letter, and through whom lie
made application for permission as aforesaid, that the
port of Amsterdam was then free from blockade, and was
advised by the said merchant to proceed thither with his
vessel-that the port of Laguira and all the ports on the
Spanish main were then shut against foreigners, whereby he was prevented from going on shore and from thaking enquiries otherwise than by writing from his vessel
to some person on shore.
Thatthe Island ofBuenos Ayres was then a dependency
ofCurragoa, distant from it about twentymilegleast, and

there was a small battery and military post. That
v.
the cruizing ground of vessels blockading Curraeoa,
WOOD.
Was batween diat Island and Ruenos Ayres, which latter
whs Included in the blockade, as were also all the other
ports of the Island of Curracoa. That Travers did not attempt to enter the port 'ofAmsterdam, nor sail towards it
with an intention of enteringit if blockaded, butmerely for
the purpose of ascertaining, by an lawful and proper
means in hs power, whether it was still n a state of
blockade, of entering it if it was not, and of proceeding elsewhere if it was.
That when he sailed from Lagmira as aforesaid lie had,
from the facts and circumstances above mentioned, reasonable ground of belief that the blockade had ceased,
and had no means of obtaining any further information
on the subjcct at any neighboring port or place.
Whereupon the Plaintiff prayed the Court to instruct
the jury that if they believed the. matters so given ii
evidence by ]in, then his right of recovery in this acafr cted by the conduct of Travers in prois not
tion
as aforesaid from Laguira towards Amsteruam

for the purposes aforesaid, which instruction the Court
gave, and also the further direction, that if they should
belie'e that Travers intended, while at Laguira, to violate the blockade o f Amsterdam, and attempted it by
sailing to%x ards that port, and within the limits of the
cruizing ground, in such case his conduct was unlawful, and the Defendants were thereby discharged frorn
any responsibility upon the policy

When this case was here before it was erroneously
supposed that the order of the 5th of January 1804,
applied to the Island of Curracoa, as well as to those of
Caudalope and Martinique. It was not until the 12tlt
of April following, that the blockade of Curra oa was
notified to our government by Mr. Merry, who gives
