FOWLE, TRADING UNDER !tHE FIRM OF WILLIAM FOWLE & SONS,
DEFENDANTS.

Where a manufacturer upon the upper waters of the Potomac shipped five hundred
kegs of nails to Alexandria, taking from the inaster of the canal-boat a receipt
saying that the nails were "to be delivered to Fowle and Sons in Alexandria, for
the use of Robert Gilmor of Baltimore," and on the same day sent a letter to the
consignees, advising them that the goods were consigned for the use of Gilmor,
such delivery and bill of lading operated as a transfer of the legal title to Gilmor,
who was in fact the consignor.
The effect of a .consignment of goods, generally, is to vest the property in the conof lading is special to deliver the goods to A for the use of
signee; but if the bill
B, the property vests in B, and the action must be brought in his name in case of
loss or damage.
Therefore, the kegs of nails in the hands of Powle & Sons were not subject to an
attachment by the creditors of the manufacturer; nor had Fowle & Sons any
valid lien upon them for previous advances to him. The title to the nails had
passed to Gilmor before they came into the possession of Fowle & Sons.
In this case the manufacturer acted bond f/de, in the transfer of the goods, for the
purpose of securing a preexisting debt to Gilmor. This being so, there was no
necessity for Gilmor's expressing his assent to the transfer, in order to the vesting
the title. The manufacturer was a competent witness.

Tins was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Columnbia and County of Alexandria.
It was a controversy respecting the right to certain kegs of

nails, which were in the hands of William Fowle & Sons, in
Alexandria.
Ou the 14th of Mach, 1843, the following was the position
of the several parties who had any concern in the matter.
John McPherson Brien carried on an extensive iron concern
upon the waters-of Antieatam Creek, in Maryland,. near the Potomac River above Harper's Ferry. He was indebted.to Robert Gilmor of Baltimore, to Daniel L. Grove of Alexandria, and
to William Fowle & Sons of the same place. To the last-mentioned house he had been in the habit of sending nails from the
foundry, and upon the preceding 21st of Februar r had written
the following letter.
I"Intieatam, February21, 1843.
"MEssRs. Wu. FOWLE & SONS:

"Yours, most respectfully,:
"JNo. MoP. BRIE.N."

In this state of affairs, Brien made a shipment by one of the
canal-boats, and took the following receipt: "Received, March 14, 1843, of John MIcP. Brien, 500 kegs
of nails, to be delivered to William Fowle & Sons, Alexandria,
D. C., for the use of Robert Gilmor, Esq., Baltimore, in good
order.

Upon the same day the following letter was written, which,
it appeared by the testimony, was not mailed at Mr. Brien's
post-office, but brought down the anal by-the boatman, and
mailed at Georgetown, on the 20th. It was received by Fowle
& Sons on the 21st.
"To MEssRs. Wm. FOWLE & SONS:"Gentlemen, -We have this day shipped on board of Capt.

Upon the preceding 23d of January Grove had filed a bill
(the origin of all these legal proceedings) against Brien and
Fowle & Sons, stating that Brien was indebted to the complainant ifi the sum of $ 1089.50, and praying that an attachment might issue against his fuids and effects in the hands of
Fowle & Sons. As soon as the nails arrived, viz. on the 20th
of March, the marshal served the attachment and subpoena.
It may be here stated, that Gilmor obtained leave of the court
to be made a defendant, and afterwards filed his answer and
cross-bill.

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

431

Grove v. Brien et al.

It is not necessary to state the progress of the suit through
all its details. The parties all answered, and much testimony
was taken, including that of Brien, which was objected to by
the counsel for Grove. Proper parties were also made in place
of some who had died.
Fowle & Sons in their answer set forth their previous dealings with Brien, the letter (above inserted) of the 21st of February, and claimed that Brien was indebted to them on account
of prior transactions, for which balance so due they had a lien
on the nails.
The answer of Gilmor, and his cross-bill, state substantially
the same facts, and, after referring to the attachment of the nails
in controversy .by Grpve, say, -That
John McP. Brien was
indebted to Robert Gilmor, (besides other large indebtedness,)
in the amount of a draft for $ 4,405.40, which was drawn by
Brien on Gilmor and by him accepted, and at maturity paid by
Gilmor, at the request and solely for the use of Brien. That
previous to the shipment of the said nails, it was agreed between Brien and Gilmor, that Brien should ship to Gilmor the
500 kegs of nails, on account of, and to be applied in part liquidation of, such pre6xisting debt.
It then proceeded to state the shipment, and claimed the nails
as his property.
The answer of John McP. Brien to the original and crossbills neither admits nor denies his indebtedness to Grove, as
charged in his original bill, but calls fdr proof. He states.his
indebtedness to Gilmor, as alleged in the cross-bill, and admits
that, according to a previous agreement between himself and
Gilmor, and in consideration of such preexisting indebtedness,
he shipped the 500 kegs of nails in controversy, on the 14th of
March, 1843, to the care of Win. Fowle & Sons. That by letter dated the 14th of March, 1843, he advised said Wm. Fowle
& Sons, that the said nails, a particular description of which is
contained in the letter, were forwarded to them, for the use of
Robert Gilmor, of Baltimore, and also inclosed them the receipt
or bill of lading of the commbn carrier, to whom the said nails
were delivered, which expressed that the same were shipped for
the use of Robert Gilmor, and denies all fraud, combination, &c.
Grove answered the cross-bill, stating his ignorance generally of the facts, calling for prof, and charging that the consignment for Gilmor's use, if made, was fraudulent, &c., &c.
The result of the evidence in the suit may be stated to establish the debt of Brien to Gilmor, to Grove, and to Fowle &
Sons, and the question was which creditor had the'preference.
The account of the sale of the nails was thus presented by
Fowle & Sons.

bills had duly answered the same, and the arguments of counsel
being heard, the court doth order, adjudge, and decree, that the
amount of sales by the defendants, William Fowle & Sons, of
the nails in controversy, made under an order in these causes
of May term, 1844, not having been excepted to, be and the
same is hereby confirmed. And the court proceeding first to
decide upon the original bill filed by the complainant, Daniel
L. Grove, doth adjudge, order, and decree, that the resident defendants, William Fowle & Sons, had not, at the filing of the
said original bill, or at any time since, in their hands any property, effects, or money belonging to the said non-resident defendant, Jno. McP. Brien; and do further adjudge, order, and
decree, that said original bill be dismissed, and that the said
Daniel L. Grove do pay to the defendants thereto their costs in
that behalf expended.
"And the court proceeding now to consider aid decide upon
the cross-bill, filed by the said Robert Gilmor in this cause,
doth adjudge, order, and decree, that the said Robert Gilmor
recover of the said John McP. Brien the sum of four thousand
four hundred and five dollars and forty cents, the amount of
the draft in the said cross-bill mentioned, with interest thereon
from the 4th day of March, 1843, till paid; to be credited,
however, by the sum of one thousand eight hundred and twelve
dollars and fifty cents, as of the 14th day of March, 1843; the
said sum of $ 1,812.50 being the gross amount of the sales of
the said five hundred kegs of nails, as shbwn by the account of
sales of the said William Fowle & Sons above mentioned; and
the court doth further order and decree, that the said William
Fowle & Sons, out of the said one thousand eight hundred and
twelve dollars and fifty cents, the proceeds of the sales of said
nails in their hands, retain the sum of four hundred and thirteen
dollars and fifty-four cents, in discharge and payment of- the
freight on the shipment of said nails, for storage, insurance,
commission on sales, and the other items of charge against the
said nails set forth in their said account of sales; and the court
doth further adjudge, order, and decree, that the said William
Fowle & Sons are not entitled to any lien on the said nails, or
their proceeds, for the sum of $ 334.60 claimed by them to be
due as a general balance of account on previous transactions
between them and the said John McP. Brien. The court doth
further adjudge, order, and decree, that William Fowle, William H. Fowle, and George D. Fowle, composing the firm of
William Fowle & Sons, pay over to the said Robert Gilmor
the sum of one thousand three hundred and ninety-eight dollars and ninety-six cents, being the balance of the sales of "the

said nails in their hands, after deducting the said sum of $ 413.54
in manner aforesaid. And the court further adjudge, order,
and decree, that the said Robert Gilmor recover of the defendants to said cross-bill his cost against them in that behalf expended.
"From which decree the complainant, Grove, in the original
bill, and a defendant in the cross-bill, prays an appeal to the
Supreme Court of the United States, which is granted, upon
his giving bond and security in the sum of $.2,500, to be approved by the court or one of the judges thereof."
Upon this appeal, the case came up to this court.
It was argued by Mr. Davis, for the appellant, and Mr.
Francis L. Smith, and Mr. Meredith, for the appellee.
The points raised by Mr. Davis, upon which the decision of
the court turned, were the following.
If the deposition of Brien be admitted, still, on consideration
of the whole evidence, the case of the answer and cross-bill is.
not proyed.
(a.) The deposition is silent as to the alleged "previous
agreement" ; nor is any communication with Gilmor prior to
the attachment shown.
(b.) The statement of the consideration is defective, - as in
the cross-bill, - being merely his drawing on Gilmor, who
accepted and paid the draft; "in consideration of which draft
and other indebtedness," &c.
5. He then states, 1st, that he shipped 500 kegs of nails to
Fowie & Sons, for use of Gilmor; 2d, that he took the annexed receipt; 3d, that the letter of March 14, 1843, was written by his authority. What that letter contained does not ap-"
pear. If it be supposed to be the one produced by Fowle &
Sons,- then, 1. It is not proved, and so cannot be read against any but
Fowle & Sons.
'2. If it be read against the complainants, it did not reach
Fowle & Sons till after the attachment, and was not mailed till
the day of the attachment.
It is not shown that the receipt ever left Brien's possession
prior to the attachment or prior to his deposition. 9 Leigh, 181.
It is submitted that these facts, if believed, do not amount to
a transfer of the title to the nails to Gilmor, prior to the at
tachment. Tiernan v. Jackson, 5 Pet. 597- 599 ; Williams v.
Everett, 14 East, 582; Grant v. Austen, 3 Price, 58; Scott et

Com. 532, 533, note a (3d ed.); 3 B. & A. 321.
The receipt is not a bill of lading; or if it be one, the mere
taking it does not change the property, nor the mere indorsement, without .delivery of it. Abbott on Ship. 329, 330;
Mitchel v. Ede, 3 Perry'& D. 513; S. C., 11 Adolph. & Ell.
888; 1 Bos. & Pal. 563; 1 Pet. 386.
But, in fact, the deposition shows that these nails were consigned generally to Fowle & Sons on their order; that the consignment for use of Gilmor is an afterthought, to cover the
property from attachment, and a device frequently resorted to
by Brien for such purposes ; and that Brien's deposition is unworthy of credit.
The counsel for the appellee, after examining the evidence
to prove that the nails were shipped by Brien to pay a pre6xisting debt to Gilmor, made the following points.
If, then, as we insist, the evidence just alluded to proves
that the nails were shipped under a special contract betweeh
Brien and Gilmor, in consideration of a preexisting debt, due
from the former to the latter, they became the property of Gilmor, on the 14th day of March, 1843, and are not liable to the
lien of an attaching creditor, and on this ground the attachment
of Grove must fail. Story's Coin. on Agency (ed. 1839), § 362,
and cases cited in note 2; Weymouth v. Boyer, 1 Yes. jr. 416;

Mylne'& Craig, 690; Wood v. Roach, 2 Dall. 180; 1 Yeates, 177.
In view of these positions, we further submit, that immediately upon the receipt of the nails by Sharpless, the common
carrier, and his signing the bill- of lading, expressing on its
face that they were to be delivered to Wm. Fowle & Sons, for
the use of Robert Gilmor of Baltimore, the'absolute title to the
nails vested in Gilmor, and their delivery to Sharpless, the carrier, operated in law as a delivery to Gilmor. The rule is the same whether the goods be sent from one inland place to another, or beyond sea. Holt on Shipping, 359; Story's Cor. on
Agency, § 361, and cases there cited; 2 Kent's Coin. (ed.

The letter of advice to Fowle & Sons, the consignees, connected with the execution of the bill of lading and the delivery to the carrier for the use of Gilmor, amounts to such an assignment and transfer of the property in the nails to Gilmor, or
to his use, as to protect them effectually against the claims of
any attaching creditor. They amount to an order drawn on the.
whole fund. Mandeville v. Welch, 5 Wheat. 277-286; Stor's

of Maryland, where the shipment was made. Story's Conflict

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

437

Grove v. Brien et al.

sonal property, which is valid by the laws of the country where
it is made, is binding everywhere. Adopting the course which
was pursued in Black v. Zacharie, the appellee Gilmor took the
depositions of Messrs. Glem and Brent, two eminent counsellors, who gave an opinion that the letter of advice from Brien
to Win. Fowle & Sons, and the carrier's receipt, according to
the course of decision of the Court of Appeals of Maryland,
vest an absolute right to the nails in controversy in Robert
Gilmor. In support of their opinions, they refer to the cases of
Powell v. Bradlee, 9 Gill & Johns. 220, and 2 Harr. & McHen.
453.
The claim of Wm. Fowle & Sons cannot be sustained, because no account has been filed showing the balance claimed
by them, and further, that they have only asked relief by their
answer. A cross-bill was necessary. Talbot v. McGee, 4 Monroe, 379; Pattison v. Hull, 9 Cowen, 747.
The nails were not shipped, as Win. Fowle & Sons suppose,
to answer their order of the 21st of February, 1843, but for the
benefit of Gilmor, in the manner stated.
The nails were appropriated, (and the evidence thereof accompanied the property,) by Brien to Gilmor, before they came
to the possession of Fowle & Sons, and therefore their lien for
a general balance does not attach. Ryberg et al. v. Snell, 2
Wash. 0. C. 294; Abbott on Shipping (ed. 1829), 389; Walker v. Birch, 6 Term Rep. 262.
Being shipped under a special contract, the nails are not subject to any intervening lien. Story on Agency, § 362; and
Weymouth v. Boyer, before cited.
The bill of lading for the nails, signed by the carrier, being
produced by Gilmor, the legal presumption arises that it was
delivered to him; either by the carrier or by the consignees,
Wm. Fowle & Sons.
John McP. Brien is a competent witness, he has no interest
in the result of the suit, he stands in mutual regard between
Grove and Gilmor, and his legal interest is equally balanced.
A witness who-is liable to both parties is competent for either.

nails were attached and in the hands of a court of equity, and
how else could he claim and litigate his right to the property?
Story's Eq. Pl. from § 319 to § 403 inclusive; 1 Smith's Oh.
Pr. 449, 460, 461, 462, 463.
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of this
District, in which a bill was filed by the complainant for the
purpose of enforcing the collection of a debt due from John
McP. Brien, a non-resident, out of goods belonging to him
within the District, in the *hands of William Fowle & Sons,
the consignees. It was defended by Fowle & Sons, on the
ground that they had a lien upon the goods. They also set
up, that the property was claimed by R. Gilmor, a merchant
in Baltimore. The bill was afterwards amended, making Gilmor a defendant, who answered, setting up his title to the property; and also filed a cross-bill against the complainant, Fowle
& Sons, and' Brien, setting forth the same title, and praying
that the proceeds, the property in the mean time having been
sold, might be paid over to him. The defendants put in several answers to the bill; but, upon the view we have taken of
the case, it is unnecessary to refer to them particularly.
The facts disclosed which it is material to notice are, that
Brien, being indebted to Gilmor, on the 14th of March, 1843,
shipped to Fowle & Sons 500 kegs of nails, the property in
question, for the purpose of securing such indebtedness, and
took from the master of the boat the following receipt or bill
Received, March 14, 1843, of John McP. Brien
of lading: -"
500 kegs of nails,-to be delivered to William Fowle & Sons,
Alexandria, D. C., for the use of Robert Gilmor, Esq., Baltimore, in good order." And on the same day sent a letter directed to the consignees, advising them- that the goods were
consigned for the use of 'Gilmor; and which was received
about the time of the arrival of the goods.
Upon these facts, the court below dismissed the original bill
of complainant, with costs, and decreed the proceeds of the
property to Gilmor, deducting freight and charges.
The case is here on an appeal by the complainant in the
original bill.
We are of opinion, that the decree of the court below was
right, and should be affirmed.
The delivery of the goods by Brien to the master, and the
bill of lading taken in the name of Gilmor, for the purpose of
securing to him an existing indebtedness, operated as a transfer
of the legal title; and the shipment, therefore, was not only in

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

Grove v. Brien et al.
fact, but in judgment of law, for and on his account. Gilmor
was the consignor.
The effect of a consignment of goods, generally, is to vest
the property in the consignee; but if the bill of lading is
special to deliver the goods to A for the use of B, the property
vests in B, and the action must be brought in his name in case
of loss or damage. (3 Salk. 290; 1 Ld. Raym. 271; 3 Barn.
& Ald. 382; 1 Binn. 109; Abbott on Ship. 216 and note;
Long on Sales, 293, Boston ed.)
If the person to whom the goods are ordered to be delivered,
is only af agent of the shipper, he has no property in them,
and cannot maintain an action against the master for-not delivering them, (Abbott, 216; 1 Camp. 369,) nor for damage for
negligence of the carrier. (3 Barn. & Aid. 382.) Arid if the
goods are shipped at the risk of the consignor, though the
freight is payable by the consignee, the property remains in
the former. (Abbott, 216; 1 Johns. 229.)
These cases, and others that might be referred to, show that
the five hundred kegs of nails in the hands of Fowle &-Sons
were not subject to the attachment of the complainant for the
liabilities of Brien, their debtor, as the title to the property had
already passed to the defendant, Gilmor; and, also, that Fowle
& Sons had no valid lien upon them as consignees for previous
advances to Brien by the delivery to the master; as they were
only agents to receive the goods on commission for sale, and
were advised by the bill of lading and correspondence, that
they were shipped for and on account of Gilmor. Though the
goods were delivered by Brien to the master for consignment,
they were delivered as the property of Gilmor, and, under circumstances, as we have seen, that had the effect to *invest him
with the title. His right, therefore, was prior in point of time
to any lien that might have been acquired, either by the complainant or Fowle & Sons, in consequence of Brien's indebtedness, upon the strictest principles of law; and as to the equities,
it was but a race of diligence among the several creditors -of a
failing debtor to see which should get the first security for their
debts.
An objection was made on the argument, that there was no
evidence that Gilmor had assented to the transfer of the property to him as security for his demand against Brien, until after
the levy of the complainant's attachment.
The original bill was amended, making him d defendant, and
in his answer he sets up that the transfer was made in pursuance of a previous agreement between him and Brien,.in part
liquidation of his indebtedness.

SUPREME COURT.

...

Grove v Brien et al.

We are inclined to think this part of the answer is responsive to the bill; and there is no evidence in the case contradicting it in this respect. Though the bill is brief and meagre in the statement of the case which it presents, and has not
incorporated init the amendment making Gilmor a defendant;
yet, from the nature of the charge against him, and ground for
making him. a party, it would seem necessarily to call upon
him to set forth his claim to the property in dispute.

jBut
unnecessary to place the answer to the objection on
this groind. -In.the absence of all evidence to the contrary, in
case of an absolute assignment of property by a debtor to his
creditor-for the purpose of securing a preExisting debt, an assent, will be presumed on account of.the benefit that he is to
derive from it,
This principle was recognized and applied by this court in
the case of Tompkins v. Wheeler, 16 Peters, 106, and had been
before,in Brooks v. Marbury, 11 Wheat. 96. No expression of
assent, the court say, of the person for whose benefit the assignment is made, is necessary to the vesting the title, as the
creditor is rarely, unwilling to receive his debt from any hand
that will pay him.
It was also objected, that Brien was an incompetent witness
for Gilmor, on the ground of interest; but it is apparent that
he had no interest,-in the suit, for in any event the property
wodld be applied to' the discharge of debts against him, and
-whether in favor of one or the other was, in point of interest,
a matter of indifference to him.
In any :-view, therefore, that can be properly taken of the
case, we are of opinion the decree of the court below was right,
and should be affirmed.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
-record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Distriet of Columbia, holden in and for the County of Alexandria,

now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court, that
the decree of the said Circuit Court iii this cause be, and the
same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.
