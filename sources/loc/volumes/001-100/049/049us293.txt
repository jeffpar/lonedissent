-SUPREME COURT.
Menard's Heirs v. Massey.

The date of such legal title commences with the ratification by Congress, and does
not extend back to the date of the imperfect title.
Therefore, the title of Cerr6, being confirmed in 1836, must give way to patents for
the same land, issued before that time, unless Congress had, by some law, protected the land from the location of patents.
But the acts of Congress did not so protect it, because the concession of Cerr6 called
for no boundaries, and had never been surveyed. Before land could be reserved
fiom sale, it was necessary to know where the land was.
The confirming act of 1836 declared that it should convey no title to any part of the
land which had previously been surveyed and sold by the United States. This
the United States had a right to do, because, having the plenary power of confirmation, they could annex such conditions to it as they chose.
"Where claims were confirmed according to the concession. a subsequent survey made
in the mode pointed out by law is conclusive upon tie United States and the
confirmee, to show that the land included in the survey was the land the title to
which was confirmed. Bit it does not follow that other persons, who may previously have purchased portions of the land from the United States, subsequent to
the confirming act and before the survey, are equally concluded.
The form of a Spanish title given.

THIS case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit
Codrt of the United States for the District of Missouri.
It was one of those cases arising from a conflict between an
old Spanish .concession and a title otherwise acquired. The
acts of Congress, passed from time to time to regulate these
claims, are all set forth in the report of the case of Stoddard v.
'Chambers, 2 Howard, 317, and need not be repeated. It is
only necessary now to state the respective titles of the plaintiffs
and defendant, as exhibited by themselves.
This was" an action of ejectment brought by Am6d6e Menard, a citizen of the State of Illinois, as assignee of Pascal L.
Cerr6, against the defendant, Samuel Massey, a citizen of the
State of Missouri, for the re6overy of a piece of land situated in
the couilty of Crawford, and State of Missouri, containing three
thousand and one acres and seventy-five hundredths of an acre,
being survey number three thousand one hundred and twenty,
of three thousand five hundred and twenty-eight arpens of land
originally granted to Pascal L. Cerr6, in township thirty-eight
north, of range five west, and townships thirty-seven and thirtyeight north, of range five west, of the fifth principal meridian.
This tract of land was confirmed by the act of Congress of the
4th of July, 1836, to Pascal L. Cerr6, the grantee, or his legal
representatives, who conveyed to Am6d6e Menard, the plaintiff.
Menard died during the pendency of the suit, and his heirs at
law were made parties to the suit, all of whom were residents'
of the State of IllinoiS. A verdict and judgment were rendered
against the plaintiffs in the Circuit Court, the case is brought to
this court by the plaintiffs in error.
The case, on each side, as it appears in the-transcript, is as
follows.

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

295

fenard's Heirs v. Massey.

On the 5th of November, 1799, one Pascal Leon Cerr6 presented his petition to Don Carlos Dehault Delassus, LieutenantGovernor and Commander-in-Chief of Upper Louisiana, for
seven thousand and fifty-six arpens of land, to be taken in two
different places, as follows: the half of said quantity, or three
thousand five hundred and twenty-eight arpens, to be taken at
the place commonly known by the name of the Great Source
of the River Maramee ; the other half ofd the head-waters of
the Gasconade, and those of the Maramee, known by the name
of La Bourbeuse.
On the 8th day of November, 1799, the Lieutenant-Governor, Charles Dehault Delassus, in pursuance of said petition,
gave a concession for the quantity of land asked for -by the
petitioner, reciting that he was well convinced of the facts set
forth and stated by the petitioner, and stated further in the
grant, that, as it was situated in a desert where there was no
settlement, and at a considerable distance from the town of St.
Louis, he was not compelled to have it surveyed immediately,
1,but as soon as some one settles on said place," in which case
he was required to have it surveyed without delay.
The said Pascal Leon Cerr6, the grantee, produced a letter
from Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, Governor-General at New
Orleans, to Monsieur Gabriel Cerr6, the father of the petitioner,
dated New Orleans, 28th April, 1798, in which he acknowledged the many services which the said Gabriel Cerr6 had
rendered the government, and his claim to the generosity of
the same; and that the said Lieutenant-Governor, seeing the
letter of the Governor-General Gayoso, inquired of said Gabriel
Cerr6 in what manner he might reward him; and that said
Cerr6 replied, that he was then advanced in years, and had a
sufficiency of lands, and recommended his son, who was the
head of a family, said Pascal Leon Cerr6, who had then received
no grant for any land, to the bounty of the government.
The concession was registered, by order of the LieutenantGovernor, in the Book of Concession, and presented to the first
Board of Commissibners for confirmation, by the grantee, September 15th, 1806; who reported against its confirmation,
September 28th, 1810; and the claim was again presented for
confirmation, 5th October, 1832, supported by documentary
and oral testimony, and was unanimously recommended for
confirmation by the Board of Commissioners, October 31st,
1833, and was confirmed by the act of Congress of the 4th of
July, 1836, to the said Pascal L. Cerr6, or his legal representatives.
The land as confirmed was surveyed under the authority of

the United States, by Deputy-Surveyor Joseph C. Brown, from
the 18th to the 20th of June, 1838, under instructions from the
surveyor of the public lands in the States of Illinois and Missouri, dated the 6th of June, 1838.
On the 26th of February,. 1844, by deed of that date, Pascal
L. Cerre qonveyed said lands, as granted, located, and surveyed,
to Am6d6e Menard, under whom the present plaintiffs claim as
heirs at law.
By the act of Congress o the 4th of July, 1836, the above
decision of the Board of Commissioners, under the acts of 1832
and 1833, was affirmed, and thereby the title under said grant
was confirmed.
The defendant admitted that he was, before and at the fime
of the commencement of this suit, in possession of the whole
of section one, township thirty-seven north, range six west, except the west half of the southwest quarter of said section, con-,
taining eighty acres, which were the same premises on which
"the Big Spring," at the source of the Maramee, is located.
The heirs at law of Am6d6e Menard, deceased, were admitted, from a statement made by Judge Pope, to be the present
plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs gave in evidence a letter from the Secretary
of the Treasury of the United States to the Commissioner of
the General Land Office, dated 10th June, 1818, in which he
was directed and instructed to furnish the receiver and register
of the land.6ffice at St. Louis, Missouri, with a descriptive list
of the land claims which had been presented and registered
under the different acts of Congress for confirming the rights
of individuals to lands that had not been confirmed, situated
within said land district, with instructions to withhold from
sale all such lands, until otherwise directed.
The land confirmed to Pascal L. Cerr4, and now sued for,
was then within the district of St. Louis. The letter of the
Secretary of the Treastiry was the official copy, transmitted by
the Commissioner of the General Land Office to the register at
St. Louis, and was produced by the said register, in whose possession the same was.
The plaintiffs gave in evidence, also, a list of claims which
had been made out by Frederic Bates, former recorder of land
titles at St. Louis, and which had been presented for confirmation, but not finally acted on by Congress; which list was also
produced by the register of the land office at St. Louis, and
taken from the files in his office, and on said list was this claim,
since confirmed to Pascal L. Cerr6.
Accompanying said list was a certificate made out by Fred-

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

297

Menard's Heirs v. Massey.

eric Bates, former recorder of land titles at St. Louis, under
date of 10th July, 1818, in which he states, - " The foregoing.
is a list of claims regularly entered in this office," and which
were supposed to be situated and intended to be located within
the county of St. Louis, and which was no doubt made out, in
pursuance of the instructions and .directions from the Commissioner of the General Land Office, under'the direction of the
Secretary of the Treasury, reserving said lands from sale.
The plaintiffs also gave in evidence a proclamation of the
President of the United States, dated June, 1823, and published
in the summer and autumn of 1823, for the sale of public lands,
on the third Monday of November in that year, at St. Louis,
which were situate in the township and range in which the
lands sued for in this action are located, and in whiclh the lands
sued for, and contained in the list made out by the recorder of
land titles, as above stated, are reserved from sale.
The property in dispute was admitted by the defendant to
be worth more than two thousand dollars.
The plaintiffs also proved, by the testimony of Augustus H.
Evans, that this claim was located at "the Big Spring" on the
Maramee. And, by the testimony of Henry A. Massey, that,
between the years 1826 and 1828, Samuel Massey, in speaking
of the works at "the Big Spring" on the Maramee, said there
was an old claim on the land, which he understood had not
been allowed, and authorized Major Biddle at that time to try
and buy up that old claim.
The plaintiffs also established, by the testimony of Joseph
C. Brown, the United States deputy surveyor, that he made the
survey of this claim, at "the Big Spring," "as~the source of
the claim."
There was offered in evidence, on the part of the plaintiffs,
Plat No. 2 from the register's office, and a copy of the original.
diagram, as certified by F. R. Conway, surveyor of the public
lands in the States of Illinois and Missouri, dated Surveyor's Office, St. Louis, 11th April, 1846; which were objected to on the
part of the defendant, and the objection sustained by the court;
to which decision of the court plaintiffs' counsel excepted.
The above facts, and also a certified survey, under the act
of 1836, constitute the title of'the plaintiffs in error.
The evidence on the part of the plaintiffs was here closed.
The defendant, as it appears from the transcript, gave in evideuice seven patents from the President of the United States,
all issued on the 20th of December, 1826, to Samuel Massey
and Thomas James, five for eighty acres of land each, and one
for eighty-two and ninety-six one hundredths acres, and one

Menard's Heirs v. Massey.

other-for'eighty-one and twelve one hundredths acres of land;
and all of said patents covering a part of the same land included in the survey of Pascal L. Cerr6, under the confirmation
made to him at the great source of the Maramee.
The evidence on both sides being closed, the counsel for the
defendant then prayed the court to direct the jury, 1. That the plaintiffs in this case cannot recover against the
defendant for any land embraced within the patents given in
evidence by the defendant.
2. That the plaintiffs cannot recover in this case against the
defendant, on account of any land within the plaintiffs' survey,
without proof that the defendant, at the commencement of this
suit, was in possession thereof; and the fact that the defendant
had cut wood upon such land is not sufficient to authorize a recovery for the land upon which the wood was cut, if these
were merely temporary trespasses and occupation of the land.
These instructions the court gave to the jury; whereupon
the counsel for the plaintiffs excepted, and upon this exception
the case came up to this court.
It was was argued by Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Badger, for
the plaintiffs in error, and Mr. Ewing, for the defendant.
The points made by the counsel for the plaintiffs- in error
were the following That the decision made by the Supreme Court of the United
States. in the case of Stoddard's Heirs v. Harry W. Chambers,
2 Howard, 284, which is the same in principle as the case now
before the court, must govern and settle this case.
That the claim of Pascal L. Cerr6 was duly filed with the
recorder of land titles, September 15, 1806; and was amongst
the first presented to the Board of Commissioners. in accordance
with and pursuant to the acts of Congress of 2d March, 1805,
and of 21st April, 1806.
The grant was made by Don Carlos Dehault Delassus, who
was clothed with ample power for that purpose, as decided in
Chouteau's Heirs v. The United States, 9 Peters, 137, and seems
to have been prompted by the Governor-General Gayoso himself, from the interest which he took, and the obligations of the
government to the father of the grantee for his many valuable
services.
The grant called for a special location, but was not required
to be surveyed, because of its being remote from the settlements,
in the very terms of the concession, and was protected by treaty. It is true, the act of Congress of 2d March, 1805, ch. 86,
required all grantees from the Spanish government to file plats,

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

299

Menard's Heirs v. Massey.

orders of survey, &c. But there was no survey made prior to
the confirmation, for, besides not being required by the terms
of the grant, in this particular case there was no public officer
to do it.
The claim is confirmed, according to the concession, and
why it was rejected by the first Board of Commissioners, 28th
September, 1810, it is difficult to conceive. The claim had
been regularly continued before the commissioners, from the
time it was first presented, 15th September, 1806, till it was
rejected, 28th September, 1810.
Congress still continued to pass laws to protect the claims
which had been thus presented for confirmation. Accordingly,
the act of the 15th of February, 1811, provides, "that, till after the decision of Congress thereon, no tract of land shall be
offered for sale, the claim to which has been in due time, and
according to law, presented to the recorder of land titles in the
District of Louisiana, and filed in his office, for the purpose of
being investigated by the commissioners appointed for ascertaining the rights of persons claiming lands in the Territory of
Louisiana." 2 Stat. at Large, 621.
The same provisions were extended and continued in force;
see-2, Stat. at Large, 665, and act of 17th February, 1818
(3 Stat. at Large, 407); and these claims were again protected
by the several acts of Congress of 1826 and 1828, until this
claim was finally unanimously recommended for confirmation
by the Board of Commissioners acting under the act of Congress of July 9th, 1832, (4 Stat. at Large, 565,) providing for
the final adjustment of private land claims in Missouri, and, in
pursuance of that recommendation, confirmed by the act of July 4th, 1836.
The plaintiffs, therefore, most respectfully contend that the
instructions asked for on behalf of the defendant, and given by
the Circuit Court of the United States on the trial of this cause,
were clearly erroneous. That the patents to Massey and James
issued on the 20th December, 1826, could confer no title; for
they issued for land reserved from sale, or location, and were
therefore void. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Peters.
And to bring a case within the second section of the act of
1836, so as to avoid a confirmation, the opposing location must
be shown to have been "under a law of the United States."
Stoddard et al. v. Chambers, 2 Howard, 317. The sale made,
and the issuing these patents to Massey and James, were not
made "under a law of the United States." They were not
only not. authorized by law, but were expressly forbidden, and
therefore no rights were acquired under these patents.

300

SUPREME COURT.
Menards Heirs v. Massey.

The counsel for the plaintiffs in error submit, with great respect to the court, that this case is precisely'in principle the
same as the case of Stoddard's Heirs v. Chambers; and that
the decision made in that case by this court Will govern in this.
That in the one case the owner of land in New Madrid, injured
by earthquakes, made a relinquishment of such land to the
United States, and, under an act of Congress, received a New
Madrid certificate, under which a location was made, and a patent issued in the name of Eustache Peltier, on land covered by
a Spanish grant made to Mordecai Bell; and in the other, Massey and James entered in the land office certain lands, and obtained from the government of the United States patents therefor, which lands were covered by a concession previously made
to. Pascal L. Cerr6 by the Spanish government; the lands in
both cases being expressly reserved from sale.
And in conclusion they state, that, =1. The plaintiffs in error claim under a confirmation of a
grant, protected by treaty, and by the act of Congress;
2. That the decision of the Circuit Court of the United
States is erroneous, and ought to be reversed, as being against
a title guaranteed by treaty, and protected by legislative enactment. - Treaty of 1803 (8 Stat. at Large, 202).

Mr. Ewing, for defendant in error.
The clTim of the plaintiffs to the land in controversy was
submitted under the a&ts of Congress of July 9th, 1832, and
March 2d; 1833, to the recorder and commissioners, and was
recommended for confirmation; and it was confirmed by the
act of July 4th, 1836, with this saving :"See. 2. And be it further enacted, That if it shall be found
that any tract or tracts confirmed as aforesaid, or any part thereof, had been previously located by any person or persons under
any law of the United States, or had been surveyed and sold by
the United States, this act shall confer no title to such lands, in
opposition to the rights acquired by such location or purchase;
but the individual or individuals whose claims are hereby confirmed shall be permitted to locate so much thereof as inter- feres with such location or purchase on any unappropriated land
of the United States,.' &c.
A part of the land claimed under this concession had been
previously surveyed and sold by the United States, and patented to the defendant and Thomas James.
The court instructed the jury that the plaintiff could not recover for any land embraced in the said patents.
1st. The first question is as to the legality of this instruction.

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

201

Menard's Heirs v. Massey.

The act of 1836 is the grant under which the plaintiffs claim
title. It may be right or wrong, just or unjust, but the plaintiffs must take it as it is, and it must be construed altogether,
which being done, it amounts to this. The United States confirm to the heirs of Am6d6e Menard all the lands contained in
their concession, except so much thereof as has been surveyed
and sold, and for that gives to them an equal quantity of land
elsewhere, to be selected by themselves.
This is the conveyance under which alone the plaintiffs can
claim title. They may accept of it or not, as they please, but
they cannot make it any thing that it is not.
Out of the statute, if they choose to go out of it for a title,
they have nothing on which ejectment can be sustained,
they have no title.
It matters not how strong or how weak may be their right
to claim a grant of the very land from the United States. They
have got no such. grant, and without it tl ey can maintain no
action. - They are left to their humble petition and remonstrance.
2d. The question arising under the second assignment of error is, whether the action of ejectment can be maintained
against a defendant who was not in possession when the suit
was brought, and who is not shown to have claimed title, upon
evidence that he had at some former period committed trespass
upon the land.
It would be difficult to maintain the affirmative of the proposition. Ejectment is a possessory action. Its object is to recover the possession of the property claimed; and, according to
the practice in England, the declaration must be served on the
defendant, or some one representing him, upon the premises,
unless he had left them immediately before to evade service.
It would be confusing the forms of action to allow a recovery in ejectment for a mere trespass, committed at a former period, and unaccompanied with possession, and would involve
the absurdity of permitting an individual to maintain an action
of ejectment for land of which he was himself in posgession at
the commencement of his suit.
MIr. Justice CATRON delivered the opinion, of the court.
On the 5th of November, 1799, Pascal L. Cerr6 petitioned
the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Louisiana for a concession
of land, in two parcels, in full property, one half of which,
or thirty-five hundred and twenty eight arpens, to be taken
at a place known by the name of the Great -Source of the
River Maramee, at about three hundred miles from its mouth,;
voL. v111.

the other half, or thirty-five hundred and twenty-eight arpens,
at some distance from the first, at the upper part of the headwaters of the Gasconade, and of those of the fork of the
Maramee, known by the name of La Bourbeuse, or Muddy.
To gratify this petition, the Lieutenant-Governor made the following concession :",St. Louis of Illinois, November 8, 1799.
"Whereas the petitioner is one of the most ancient inhabitants. of this country, whose known conduct and personal qualities are recommendable, and being convinced of, the truth of
what he exposes in his petition, I do grant the petitioner the
land which he solicits; and as it is situated ih a desert where
there is no settlement, and at a considerable distance from this
town, he is not compelled to have it surveyed immediately, but
as soon as some one settles on said place, in which case he
must have it surveyed without delay; and Don Antonio Soulard, Surveyor-General of this Upper Louisiaha, will take coginizance of this title for his own intelligence and government in
the part which concerns him, so as to enable the interested,
after the survey is executed, to solicit the title in due form
from the Intendant-General of these provinces of Louisiana.
"CARLOs DEHAULT DELASSUS."

"Registered by order of the Lieutenant-Governor, pages 15
and 1.6 of Book No. I. Titles of Concessions. - SOULARD."
This claim was laid before the first board in the following
form :".'September 15, 1806. Pascal L. Cerr6, claiming a tract of
a league square, to be surveyed in two parts or halves, the one
on the Big Spring of the River Maramee, so as to include said
spring, and the other at the fall of the forks of the Gasconade
'and those of the Maramee, called the Muddy, produces a concession from Charles Dehault Delassus, dated 8th November,
1779."
That board (September 28, 1810) were of opinion, that the
claim ought not to be confirmed; and so reported to Congress.
And thus the claim stood until October 31, 1833, when it was
presented to the second board, created by the act of 1832; and
this board was of opinion, and reported to Congress, "that the
claim ought to be confirmed to Pascal L. Cerr6, or his legal representatives, according to the concession."
And by the act
of July 4, 1836, Congress confirmed the claim according to the
report, and consequently according to the unsurveyed.aoncession.

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

303

Menards Heirs v. Massey.

The township, including "the Big Spring of the River Maramee," was offered for sale on the third Monday of November,
1823, pursuant to the proclamation of the -President. Whether
Massey and James purchased at the public sale in 1823, or efttered afterwards, does not appear from the record; but in 1826
and 1827 they obtained their different patents for the land in
dispute, from the United States; and these titles, the court
below charged the jury, were superior to Oerr6's confirmed
claim. And here the question arises, whether Oerr6's concession, on being confirmed by Congress in 1836, related back to
its date of 1799, and overreached the United States title made
to Massey and James. If it does so relate to the extent of the
survey made under the confirmation in 1838, and approved in
1840, then the controversy is at an end; and as on this assumption the suit was brought, it becomes necessary to examine the question of relation of title. The argument is, that the
concession was made by an officer who had power to grant;
and having done so, the land granted was "property," and protected by the third article of the treaty of 1803, which declares
that the inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be maintained
and protected in the.free enjoyment of their liberty and property; and that the laws of nations, equally with the stipulations
of the treaty, secured the title of such grantees.
That the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Louisiana had the
authority, as a sub-delegate, under the Intendant-General of
the provinces of Upper and Lower Louisiana and Florida, to
make concessions, is undeniable; he could and did deal with
the public domain of the province, -made concessions, directed
the lands to be surveyed, and caused grantees to be put into possession. This, however, does not settle the question. It does
not depend upon the existence of power, or want of power, in
the Lieutenant-Governor, but on the force and effect of the
right his concession conferred. Did it give such a vested title in
the soil, as that the Spanish government could not legally disavow it? Or could the Intendant-General, representing the
royal authority, lawfully refuse to confirm the concession, and
order the grantee to be turned out of possession ? If it be true,
that the title ended with the concession, survey, and occupancy
of the land granted, then it follows, that the title was completed and perfected under the Spanish laws, by these acts;
nor was a confirmation from any higher power than the Lieutenant-Governor at all necessary; the grantee having all the
title that the king could give. The assumption, that such was
the Lieutenant-Governor's power, and the force and effect of
the title, sets out with the assertion, that neither the regula-

tions of Morales, nor any previous regulations of the Spanish
governors, were ever -in force in Upper Louisiana, and that the
act of the Lieutenant-Governor was conclusive as to lamwand
fact when making grants; that he could grant to any one, for
any, quantity, and for any reason, or without reasons, and on
any condition, or without conditions; and that no authority
existed to supervise his acts; and we are referred to various
expressions and conjectures on this subject. In the cases of
Soulard and Smith T., against the United States, (4 Peters,)
this court, after holding the cases under advisement for a year,
professed itself unable, from want of information, to give any
opinion in the matter; and, for this reason, the cases were not
then decided. This occurred in 1830. In 1835 and 1836, in
the cases of Clarke, Delassus, and two of Choutean's Heirs,
found in 8, and 9 Peters, regulations for the government of
sub-delegates are admitted to have existed, but not to such an
extent as to control the Lieutenant-Governors in regard to person, quantity, or reason, when making concessions and orders of
survey; and such has been the doctrine of this court since that
time, so far as concessions made in Upper Louisiana have been
adjudged. These cases address themselves to a single consideration; that is to say, whether the Lieutenant-Governor's
powers were so limited that the concessions then before the
court were void for want of power; but they do not settle the
question, that the grant was a perfect title. It is said by the
court in the case of Chouteau's Heirs, 9 Peters, 154, - "It is
remarkable, that, if we may trust the best information we have
on the subject, neither the Governor nor Intendant-General has
ever refused to perfect an incomplete title granted by a deputygovernor or sub-delegate." In point. of fact, this is certainly
true. No such refusals could take place. From the parts of
Upper Louisiana, where grants were made, to New Orleans,
where the Intendant-General and Governor-in-chief resided and
kept their offices, the distances were so great, and the trackless
wilderness between so infested with hostile Indian tribes, that
few could apply, had'they possessed the means to pay for perfecting their titles. And, in the next place, the principal standard of value was skins in the upper'province; specie was hardly
known there. And then, again, land was of no material value
to such a population, who resided in villages, and ciltivated
patches within a common fence, where each inhabitant had his
portion assigned by a syndic. But two instances are known to
exist in Upper Louisiana, where the lntendant was applied to
for a complete title, and made the same: one case was that of
Moses Austin for a league square at Mine Breton, a report on

which is found in 2 American State Papers, 678, and the other
perfected title was made to Mr. Reigh, in the neighbourhood
of St..Louis.
The fact, therefore, that the intendant-generals and goverIors did not refuse to make perfect titles, is no evidence that
they had not the power to. deal absolutely with concessions
made by sub-delegates, and to give titles or refuse them, as the
Congress of the United States has' done. Like Congress, the
exercised the sovereign power. The concession before us addresses itself to the Intendant-General and refers the grantee to
him, "to solicit the title in due form,' r as do, uniformly, all the
&ncessions and orders of survey made by lieutenant-governors, after the Intendant was restored to power. By the eightyfirst article of the royal ordinance providing for Intendants of
New Spain, (2 White's Recop. 69, 71,) such Intendants were
made the peculiar judges of causes and questions arising in their
respective districts, relating to the sale, distribution, and grant
of royal lands; and, a dispute having arisen in 1797, between
Morales, Intendant ad interim, and Don G. de Lemos, Governor of Louisiana, respecting the exclusive right claimed by the
former to control such grants, (see Ibid. 469, et seq.,) the royal
order of 22d October: 1798, was issued, reaffirming this eightyfirst article, and declaring the powers of the Intendant to be
plenary, and in conclusion of all other authority, to divide and
grant all kinds of lands belonging to the crown. (Ibid. 245,
477.) Acting under and by virtue of these two royal orders,
the Intendant, Morales, on the 17th of July, .1799, published
his regulations, addressed to the lieutenant-governors, sub-delegates, ana to the people of the provinces of Lower and Upper
Louisiana, and West Florida, so that those who wished to
obtain lands might know in what manner to ask for them, and
on what conditions they could be granted and sold -. " And
especially," in his own language, "that those who are in possession without the necessary titles may know the steps .hey
ought to take to come to an adjustment; that the commandants and sub-delegates of the ifitendancy may be informed
of what they ought to observe." He then states, that a great
number of those who have aske& for land think themselves the
legal owners of it; those who have -obtained the first decree,
by which a surveyor is ordered to measure and put them in
possession; others, after a survey has been made, have neglected
to ask for "a title to the property" ; aad as like abuses, continuing for a longer time, will augment the confusion and disorder
which will necessarily esult, "we declare, that no one of those
who have obtained said decrees, notwithstanding in virtue of

them tie survey has taken place, and that they have been put
-in-possession, can be regarded as owners of the land, until their
Teal titles are delivered c6mpleted, with all the formalities before recited." The foregoing is an extract from the eighteenth
article of the regulations of July, 1799, which regulations had
-the force of written law up to the time when a change of government took place. The formalities for completing a real title
are prescribed by the three articles preceding the eighteenth;
the surveyor was bound to forward to the Intendant a survey,
and also a copy of the survey, or rather figurative plot, and a
certificate called a proces-verbal, signed by the commandant,
or a syndic and two neighbours, together with the surveyor, declaring that the survey was made in their presence, and corresponded with the facts stated in the proces-verbal, and on -the
concession, this figurative plot, and the proces-verbal, the complete title was founded; 'a copy of the plot and proces-verbal
being attached; and which evidence of title was recorded in
several departments.
Such, in substance, was the real title
completed.
The necessity of a further title than a mere loose
order of survey, given by commandants of posts and lieutenantgovernors, and placed in the hands of the interested party, is
too manifest for comment. Petitions were written by the party
asking the land, or some one for him; the governor consented,
-usually by indorsement on the petition, and ordered that the
petitioner should have the land, and directed that it should be'
surveyed; the paper was handed to the petitioner, who might
deliver it to the surveyor, or omit it; if he presented it, and
the land was laid off, then it was the surveyor's duty to record
both the concession and plat, together with -the proces-verbal.
But this did not make the party owner; without the further
title
act of the king's deputy, -the Intendant-General, -the
still continued in the crown.
As assumed in argument, (and truly,) by the third article of
the treaty by which Louisiana was acquired, and by the laws
of nations, the inhabitants of the ceded territory were entitled
to be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their
property. But in what property? To such an interest in it, if
land, as they had when the country changed owners; and that
interest being of a character requiring royal sanction before the
Spanish government would recognize it as divesting the public
titl3, our government, as the successor of Spain to the public
lands, gave the same construction and effect to concessions and
orders of survey; holding, that the title of the king's domain
passed by treaty to the United States, notwithstanding the existence of such concessions. Yet, to the full extent of any equity

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

307

in the claimants, the government adopted means to satisfy the
claims; and, as the sovereign power could not be sued as legal
owner, Boards of Commissioners were created, with liberal
powers, to investigate every description of claims, and report on
them to Congress, for the sanction of sovereign authority; and
by this means many claims were confirmed, the legal title added,
and incipient concessions completed into perfect and conclusive
titles against the government. Then, again, Congress provided
that special courts should be organized, in which the government might be sued, in a prescribed form, and decrees be made
for or against claimants; but no suit could be maintained in an
ordinary action of ejectment, or for title of any kind, on a concession and an order of survey, for want of legal title to sustain
it. Such claimants "1were not regarded as owners of land, until the real title was delivered completed," in the language of
the Spanish regulation No.- 18. Had the courts of justice been
allowed to hold otherwise, and to interfere in the matter, and
to decree titles to claimants in equity,'or to enforce their claims
at law, and oust the United States indirectly by suing persons
found on the land, little or no occasion would have existed for
boards, or special courts, to adjudge respecting the validity of
claims; as the ordinary tribunals could have settled all controversies under State laws declaring such claims cognizable in the
State courts. It was therefore manifest, that claims resting on
the first incipient steps must depend for their sanction and
completion upon the sovereign power; and to this course claimants had no just cause to object, as their condition was the same
under the Spanish government. No standing, therefore, in an
ordinary judicial tribunal has ever been allowed to these claims,
until Congress has confirmed them and vested the legal title in
the claimant. Such, undoubtedly, is the doctrine assumed by
our legislation. To go no further, the act of May 26th, 1824,
allowing claimants a right to present their claims in a court of
justice, pronounces on their true character. It declares, that the
claim presented for adjudication must be such a one as might
have been perfected into a complete title under and in conformity to the laws, usages, and customs of the government under
which the same originated, had the sovereignty of the country
not been transferred to the United States; and, by the sixth
section, when a decree is had favorable to the claim, a survey
of the land shall be ordered, and a patent shall issue therefor;
and by section eleventh, "1if the decree shall be in the claimant's favor, and the land has been sold by the United States, or
otherwise disposed of, the interested party shall be allowed to
enter an equal quantity of land elsewhere." So, again, the act

308

COURT.

Menard's Heirs v. Massey.

of July 9th, 1832, creating the last board, directs the cominissioners to inquire into'and examine all unconfirmed claims previously fitd, founded on any incomplete grant, concession, warrant, or order of survey, issued by the 'authority of France or
Spain, and to class the same so as to show, first, what claims,
in their opinion, would in fact have been confirmed according
to the laws, usages, and customs of. the Spanish government
and the practice of- the Spanish authorities under them "at
New Orleans," if the government under which said claims originated had continued in Missouri - and, secondly, what claims,
in their opinion, are destitute of merit under such laws, usages,
and customs. And by section third it is declared, that from and
after the final report of the commissioners, the lands of the second class shall be subject; to sale, the same as other public lands;
and that those of the first class shall. continue to be reserved
from sale, as heretofore. From the. first act, -passed in 1805, up
to the present -time, Congress has never allowed, to these claims
any standing other than that of mere orders of survey and promises to give title; and which promises addressed 'themselves to
the sovereign power in its political and legislative capacity,
and which must act, before the courts of justice could interfere and protect the claim. And so this court has uniformly
held. The title of Cerr6 having no standing in court before it
was confirmed, it must of necessity .take date from the confirmation, and cannot relate back so as to overreach the patents
made in 1826 and 1827.
The next ground relied on to reverse the decision of the Circuit Court is, that Cerr6's claim was reserved from entry and
grant by the act of March 3d, 1811, providing for the sale of
public lands and the final adjustMent of land claims. The fifth
section declares that back lands to front grants on the Mississippi River, &c., are reserved from sale; and by section sixth
it is provided, that, until after the decision of Congress thereon,
no tract of land shall be offered for sale, the claim to which
has been, in due time, and according to law, presented to the
register of the land office for th purpose of being investigated
by the commissioners appointed for ascertaining the rights of
persons claiming lands in the Territory of Orleans. The eighth
section declares, that the Surveyor-General shall cause such
lands in the Louisiana Territory as the President shall direct
to be surveyed, like other public lands; offices are established
for their disposal, and it is directed that they shall be sold by
order of the President. But from this power to sell are excepted section number sixteen, salt springs, and lead mines, with
such lands adjoining thereto as the President shall direct; and

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

309

Menard's Heirs v. Massey.

then comes the exception relied on for the protection of Cerr6's
claim, to wit, - " That, till after the decision of Congress thereon, no tract of land shall be offered for sale, the claim to which
has been, in due time, and according to law, presented to the recorder of land titles in the District of Louisiana, and filed in his
office, for the purpose of being investigated by the commissioners appointed for ascertaining the rights of persons claiming
lands in the Territory of Louisiana." (See Land Laws, 194.)
That this provision is an exception to the general powers
conferred on the officers to sell, is not an open question; having been so adjudged by this court in the case of Stoddard's
Heirs v. Chambers, reported in 2 Howard; and again at the
present term, in the case of Bissell v. Penrose, post, p. 317.
Nor is it an open question, that the act of February 17, 1818,
§ 3, rednacts and continues in force the exception as respects
such lands. This was also decided by the above cases-; and
that such was the opinion of Congress is manifest from the
third section of the act of July 9, 1832, under which the last
board acted; for it declares, that lands of the first class shall
be reserved from sale "as heretofore."
All. these acts of Congress, with their exceptions, address
themselves especially to the Department of Public Lands, as by
them that department must be guided. In reserving lands from
sale, it was neeessary to know where they were situated, and
how far they interfered with the public surveys. Either the
President, or some other officer, must have had the power to
designate the lands as those adjoining to salt springs and lead
mines; or it must have appeared in some public office appertaining to the Land Department what the boundaries of reserved
lands were; and if it did not appear, no notice of the claim
could be taken by the surveyors, nor by the registers and receivers when making sales. This was a conclusion that has
from necessity been acted on at the land offices; and as Cerre's
claim was not surveyed before the confirmation took place, no
boundaries of his tract could be recognized when the public
surveys were made and the lands sold. He claimed no "1tract
of land." The laws refer to specific tracts that are claimed; it
is not material whether the boundaries are proper, and according to the concession, or the claim be just or otherwise, so that
the tract claimed be certain. This was also decided -in the
cases just cited. Certainly, a mere floating claim, founded on a
concession that was ordered to be located by survey, and where
no survey or location'had been made, was not protected by the
act of 1811. An actual survey is not indispensable; but boundaries must appear, in some form, from the notice of claim and

310

the accompanying evidences filed with the recorder. If, from
these, the tract could not be laid down on the township sur-.
veys, then the land could not be reserved from sale; although,
by the concession, and by the notice, a particular spbt, (as the
Big Spring of the Maramee,) was referred to in general terms
as the place where the land should lie.
But there is another ground of defence, that would have been
conclusive, even had Cerr6's claim been surveyed and the survey filed with the recorder in 1806, accompanying the notice
of claim. By the second section of the confirming act of July
4th, 1836, it is provided, that, "if it shall be found that any
tract confirmed by this act, or any part thereof, had been surveyed and sold by the United States, this act shall confer no
title to such lands, in opposition to the rights acquired by such
location or purchase; and the party whose claim is confirmed
by this act shall be authorized to enter a quantity of land equal
to the interference elsewhere."
Having seen that the United States might confirm the claim
of Cerr6, or might refuse to do so; and that it took date as a
title recognized in the judicial tribunals from the .confirming act,
it follows that the claim might be confirmed in such part, and
on such conditions, as Congress saw proper to prescribe; and
having refused to confirm it for lands lying within its boundaries which had been previously sold, and the patents to Massey
and James being of this description, they are the only legal
title to the land; and, therefore, the charge of the Circuit Court
was proper.
The survey of Cerr4's- tract, founded on the confirmation,
was given in evidence, and recognized as part of his title by
the Circuit Court; which circumstance we deem it proper not
to pass without notice. By the act of April 26th, 1816, it was
provided that a surveyor should be appointed of the public
lands for the Territories of Illinois and Missouri, whose duty it
should, be to cause so much of the lands in said Territories as
the President should direct, to be surveyed and divided as were
the public lands lying northwest of the River Ohio; and the
act declares that "it shall also be the duty of the surveyor to
cause to be surveyed the lands in said Territories, the claims to
which have been, or hereafter may be, confirmed by any act of
Congress, which have not already been surveyed according to
law: and he shall transmit to the registers of the land offices in
said Territories, general and particular plats of all the lands surveyed or to be surveyed, and shall also forward copies of said
plats to the Commissioner of theGeneral Land Office; and all
the plats of surveys, and all other papers and documents pertain-

ing, or which did pertain, to the office of Surveyor-General under the Spanisli government within the limits of the Territory of
Missouri, &c., shall be delivered to the surveyor appointed under
this act." "And any plat of survey, duly certified by said surveyor, shall be admitted as evidence in any of the courts of the
United States, or the Territories thereof." Under this authority, Cerr6's claim was surveyed; as will better appear by the
following certificate, precediifg the description ofthe lines :" Plat and description of the survey of a tract of 3,528
French arpens, equal to 3,001 and twenty-five hundredths
English acres of land, situated in township thirty-eight north,
range five west; and townships thirty-seven and thirty-eight
north of the base line, range six west of the fifth principal meridian, in the State of Missouri; executed from the 18th tO the
20th of June, 1838, by Joseph C. Brown, deputy surveyor, under instructions from the surveyor of the public lands in the
States of Illinois and Missouri, dated the 6th of June, 1838; it
being the one half of 7,056 arpens, or a league square, granted
in two tracts of equal quantity, on the 8th of November, 1799,
to Pascal L. Cerr6, by Zenon Trudeau, Lieutenant-Governor
of the Spanish province of Upper Louisiana; this tract 'to be
taken at the place commonly known by the name of the Great
Source of the River Maramee, at about three hundred miles from
its mouth, so as to include the said sources'; and confirmed to
Pascal L. Cerr6 by the act of Congress of the United States
approved on the 4th of July, 1836, entitled, IAn act confirming claims to land in the Scate of Missouri, and for other purposes,' according to the decision No. 2 of the report of the
Board of Commissioners appointed by the act of Congress, approved on the 9th of July, 1832, entitled, 'An act for the final
adjustment of private land claims in Missouri,' and the act of
Congress approved the 2d of March, 1833, supplemental thereto."
Thb Surveyor-General approved the survey, June 26, 1840.
In having the land" laid off, and in approving the survey, he
acted under the authority of Congress, expressly conferred by
the act of 1816. Joseph C. Brown t~stified that he made this
survey, being the same offered in evidence above; that the
survey was made at the time stated on its face, and was made
by the witness at the place known and called "the Big Spring
of the Maramee "; that the said spring was on section one,
as marked and designated on the plat before him. The Big
Spring was a very large body of water, breaking out of a high
bluff, and made a stream from the spring itself of about one
hundred feet wide, and a foot in depth; that witness made the
survey by direction, and under the authority given to him by

312

MenarXd's Heirs v. Massey.

the Surveyor-General of "the United States at St. Louis. Witness further stated, that -the survey *as made according to
Mr. Cerre's directions, and in obedience to the instructions
given to him by. the Surveyor-General; Mr. Cerr6 made no
particular reconnoissance of the ground, although personally
present, but took the land as it came; and it was made by the
surveyor at the particular place indicated, the Big Spring, as
the' source of his claim. Witness stated further, that -the
instructions from the Surveyor-General were printed instructions, of which a copy is set out. Among numerous and detailed instructions referred to by the witness, there are the
following: " Information given to you by a claimant or his agent relating to the situation of a claim will govern your operations,
provided you believe, from all the circumstances which come
to your knowledge, that such information is correct; and provided also that it does not contradict the papers with which
you may be furnished. The position of any point or place
called for in a concession, and also of the settlement, or improvement in virtue of which a settlement claim is confirmed,
must be stated in your field notes. The suivey of claims
which are -confirmed unconditionally, according to a former
survey, will conform thereto, regardless of any excess or deficiency in quantity, provided the old lines and -corners can
b e found and properly identified; in which event, the old
corners will be run to, and the true courses and lengths of the
several lines, according to your operations, will be correctly
stated in your field notes; and if the old lines and corners
cannot all be found, you will conform to the old survey, as
near as practicable, by running the courses and distances called
for, or, to the intersection of the proper lines, as may be required, making the necessary allowance for the difference in
the-variation
of the needle.
"2 . The resurveyp
of claims which are confirmed according
to an old survey, but are restricted in quantity, will be surveyed
as 6bove directed for those not restricted, except that, if there
-is-any excess or deficiency, it will be thrown off or taken in a
line parallel to that old line of the survey, which the claimant
may direct; or if he fails.or declines to give directions, throw
off th1e excess or take in the deficient quantity on the side
which you think will best promote his interest; being careful to note all the particulars relating thereto in your field book,
and give the position of the old lines and corners which may
be abandoned because of the excess or deficiency in quantity.
"3. Claims which are confirmed accordiig to the conces-

sion, and have been legally surveyed in conformity therewith,
except as to exactness in quantity, will be resurveyed as the
class of cases last above mentioned.
"4. If the survey heretofore executed of a claim which is
confirmed according to a concession, whether the concession
is, or is not, special as to locality, but is special as to the direction of the lines, the proportional length of the different sides,
or the figure of the survey to be made in virtue thereof, does
not conform to these requirements of the concession, the said
survey will be altogether disregarded, except so far as it may
be useful, in cases where the concession is not special as to
locality, in identifying the situation of the intended concession
to be confirmed, unless the survey was executed and approved
by the proper Spanish officer prior to the transfer of the country to the United States; in which event, the survey will be
considered as evidence of the changed intention of the authority making the concession, and will be taken as a part and parcel thereof.
"5. Claims which are confirmed according to special concessions, and which have not been surveyed, you will survey
in strict accordance with the terms of the concessions; always
bearing in mind, that where there are no, special requirements
in the concession, it was the general practice of the government with which the claims originated to run them either in
squares, or in right-angled parallelograms of one, fiye, ten, or
some intermediate or greater number of arpens, by forty or
eighty, according to the size of the tract,or double as long as
wide, unless some other survey or grant intervened and rendered a departure from this rule unavoidable; in which case, the
rule was only so far departed from as was necessary to get rid
of the interference with prior surveys."
Cerre's claim was of the last class. The land was directed
to be surveyed according to his directions; the surveyor having
regard to the last (and fifth) instruction, with the exception,
that the special spot called for in the concession was required
to be laid down and noted in some part of the survey. When
it was made, and the field notes returned to the SurveyorGeneral's office, and the description and plat made out in form
and approved by the Surveyor-General; it was conclusive
evidence, as against the United States, that the land granted
by the confirmation of Congress was the same described and
bounded by the survey; unless an appeal was taken by either
party, or an opposing claimant, to the Commissioner of the
General Land Office. This consideration depends on the fact,
that the claimant and the United States were parties to the
27

selection of the land; for, as they agreed to the survey, they
are mutually bound and respectively estopped by it. But private claimants of lands within its boundaries, who were no parties to the survey, are not estopped, and may controvert its conclusiveness, so far as their claims interfere with the lands thus
selected by the party, and which were laid off to him by the
United States. We. are not called upon to say, nor do we
wish to be understood as intimating, to what retrospective date
the confirmation by Congress of land thus surveyed relates, so
as to 'overreach a claim by purchase from the United States,
further than the case before us requires, which is, that lands
purchased befpre the act of July 4th, 1836, was passed, are
protected against the confirmation made by that act.
For the reasons stated, we order the judgment of the Cir'cuit Court to be affirmed.
For a more perfect understanding of the manner in which
a complete title under the Spanish government was executed,
the form of such a title, translated from the Spanish, is hereto
