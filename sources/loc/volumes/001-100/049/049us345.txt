period of time to which the facts must apply, and the reservation of the Spanish claim be shown to have been made. The
two surveys then existed and were on the record, and if neither
was specially designated as Tillier's claim, there was no location of it within the reservation act. He could not claim both
surveys, and as there was nothing on record to guide the New
Madrid claimant in his loqation, he cannot be chargeable with
notice.
Under these circumstances, I think the court erred in its instruction to the jury, that the Spanish claim was reserved from
sale, and that the New Madrid location was void. I think, for
this error, the judgment should be reversed.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District
of Missouri, and was argued by counsel. On consideration
whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court,
that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be,
and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.

CITIZENS OF NEW YORK, DEFENDANTS IN ERROR.

The decision of this -court in the case of Stoddard et al. v. Chambers (2 Howard,
285) refxamined and confirmed.
The original petition to the Spanish Governor of Louisiana, upon which the concession was made, stated that he "came over to this side of the Al. R. S. with the
consent of your predecessors." These letters stand for Majeste Rive Sad, and refer to the Mississippi River.
The survey of the concession in 1806 fixed its locality. it is true that the suryey
'was a private one, but it was adopted by the commissioners, who had authority to
direct such surveys as they deemed necessary.
The holder of a New Madrid certificate had a right to locate it only on public lands
the sale of which was authorized by law. But lands claimed under a Spanish
concession, where the claim had been filed according to the acts of Congress, were
reserved from sale when the entry under the New Madrid certificate was made,
viz. in 1816. Consequently, the entry was void.
The patent for the land covered by the New Madrid certificate was not issued until
after Congress had renewed this reservation, viz. in 1832. Therefore, neither the
entry nor patent can give a good title.
Had the patent been issued before Congress passed the act of 1832, the restlt would
have been different.

SUPREME COURT.
Mills v. Stoddard et al.

THis case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Missouri.
It was an ejectment brought in the Circuit Court by the defendants in error, as heirs of Amos Stoddard, to recover 350
arpens of land, which is thus described in the declaration: " Being the same tract originally granted by the Spanish government, in the province of Upper Louisiana, to Mordecai Bell,
by concession bearing date 29th January, 1800, and being the
same 'tract located and surveyed by the proper officer on or
about'the first day of January, 1806, and which concession and
survey have been duly confirmed by the Congress of the United States to the said Mordecai Bell, or to his legal representatives, according to the said survey, and which tract is the same
coiitained in the survey No. 3,026, made by the authority of
the United States, under and by virtue of the confirmation
aforesaid, and is bounded on the east by the forty-arpen field
lot, on the south-by a tract called the Mill tract, and on the north
and west by lands described as public lands on the survey made
as afdresaid on the 1st of January, 1806."
The title of the heirs of Stoddard was particularly set forth
in the report of the case of Stoddard v. Chambers, 2 Howard,
284, and it need not be repeated. Mills claimed under the same
title as Chambers, both deriving their titles from two New
Madrid certitca'tes issued to Peltier and Coontz. It was admitted that, at the commencement of the suit, the defendant,
Mills, was in possession of a portion of the tract comprehended
in the survey of Mackay, made in January, 1806,-'for Amos
Stoddrd, being forty acres conveyed to said defendant on. the
14th of March, 1836, by Hamilton R. Gamble and wife.
It was also admitted, that the property sued for was worth
more than ten thousand dollars; that the plaintiffs claimed in
this action four undivided fifths of the land described in the
declaration ; that the other undivided fifth had been conveyed
to Hamilton R. Gamble in fee ; and that the whole of the land
sued for was embraced in the patent to Peltier.
Some testimony was given on the part of the defendant, with
a view of impeaching the title of the plaintiffs, which was not
produced in the trial of the cause of Stoddard v. Chambers,
and which evidence it is proper to insert here.
Pascal. L. Cerr6, a witness for defendant, testified that he
came to St. Louis very young from Canada, in the year 1777,
returned to Canada, and came back to St. Louis in 1779,
and remained there till 1781; that he then went to Canada,
and staid there till 1787, when he came to St. Louis, where he
remained till 1791,-when he again visited Canada and staid

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

Mills v. Stoddard et al.

there till 1794, when he came to St. Louis, where he has remained ever since; that he was well acquainted with Mordecai
Bell and his family, his father, mother, brothers, &c., and knew
him when he first came to the Spanish country; that said
Mordecai Bell resided at Wild Horse Creek, a few miles south
of the post of St. Andre, where James Mackay was commandant in Spanish times; it was about two or two and a half miles
south of that post where Mordecai Bell lived, and was about
forty miles west-southwest of St. Louis i that Mordecai Bell
never resided at any time nearer St. Louis than that place, nor
did any other of the Bells; that Mordecai Bell lived at that
place several years, and then went away; that said Bell was
principally employed in hunting, drinking, and playing cards;
he led a vagabond sort of a life; that he, Cerre, lived all the
time at St. Louis, while Mordecai Bell was at Wild Horse
Creek; that he, witness, knew the land occupied by Stokes;
and that there was no improvement or cultivation there under
Spanish government, nor, until Stokes cultivated it, was there
any cultivation; said witness examined said original petition
of Mordecai Bell, given in. evidence by plaintiffs, and stated
that he knew the handwriting of James Mackay well, and that
it was, wi " the signature, except the mark, all in Mackay's
handwrit .g; that he did not know why Stoddard's Mound
was so called, but supposes it was because he purchased the
land on which it was, and did not know when it was first so
called, whether at Stoddard's death; he thinks it was before
his death.
The defendant then offered in evidence the deposition of
Mordecai Bell, which was objected to by the plaintiffs' counsel ; -1st, because of irrelevancy; 2d, if not irrelevant, that
it went to impeach a title conveyed by the witness ; - which
objection was overruled, and the deposition read, which is as
follows:

-

"Deposition of Mordecai Bell, produced, sworn, and examined at the house of said Bell, at Moreau township, in the
county of Morgan, and State of Missouri, before me, John
Chism, judge of the County Court for the County, of Morgan
aforesaid, in a certain cause now pending in the Circuit Court
of the United States for the District of Missouri, between Simeon Stoddard, Curtis Stoddard, Daniel Stoddard, Anthony Stoddard, William Stoddard, Joseph Bunnell and Lucy Bunnell,
Jonas Foster and Lavinia Foster, Lucy Hoxie, Daniel Morgan,
and Arva Morgan, plaintiffs, and Adam L. Mills, defendant, on
the part of the defendant.

he resides in Moreau township, in the county of Morgan and
State of Missouri; that he was first married on the 8th day of
March, in the year 1802, and that parts of the three winters
preceding his marriage, he was hunting in! the upper parts of
this Siate; that neither in the year 1800, nor' any year after,
did. he petition the Spanish Governor Delassus for any grant
of land. That a few years after he was married, Santiago Mackay repeatedly asked deponent to petition the Spanish governor for a grant of land; that some two or three years after deponent was married, Mackay told him that he, deponent, had a
head right, and that he, Mackay, wished to change a tract, of
land for his head right, which he, deponent did; that he never
petitioned the Spanish Governor for any grant of land in or in
the neighbourhood of the town .ofSt: Louis, nor was there any
granted him to the best of his knowledge ; thai he resided in
the counties of St. Louis and Franklin till the year 1819

mark.
Adolphe Renard, for defendant, testified that he is a Frenchman, and the French language is his mother tongue; that he
has been in the recorder of land titles' office since April, 1837,
and more or less in habit of handling papers there, making
copies and translations, and' that the translation of the said
original petition of Mordecai Bell -which translation is given
in evidenc e by defendant - is a correct and faithful translalion; that the letters "1 M. R. S." in said petition be considers
as put for "Majeste Rive Sud" ; that he, witness, knows nothing of the Spanish laws; that Julius De Mun was a good translator, and understood both French and English. He further
stated that he never saw a concession where a commandant of
a post recommended a -grant of land lying close to St. Louis,
the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor.
William Milburne, for -defendant, testified- that he had been
in the surveyor's office from 1816 to 1841, a part of the time
as clerk, and the latter part of the' time as surveyor-general.
He examined the said petition of Mordecai Bell, as translated
by Renard, and the concession, and stated that he, as surveyor,
should survey said concession on the south bank of the Missouri River, if not otherwise directed ; - that the post of St. Andre was in what is called Bonhomme Bottom, some thirty
miles from St. Louis; that St. Andre was close on the river,
and its site has been partially or wholly washed away by the
river.

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

Mills v. Stoddard et aL

The plaintiffs, by way of rebutting testimony, gave in evidence the following letter of the Secretary of the Treasury of
the United States, produced by Thomas Watson, register of the
land office at St. Louis, from the files of his ofe, dated 10th
June, 1818.

" Treasury Department, 1Oth June, 1818.
are requested to instruct the recorder of land
titles in the Missouri Territory to furnish to the receiver and
register of the land district of St. Louis a descriptive list of
the land claims which have been presented and registered un'der the different acts of Congress for confirming the rights of
individuals to lands which have not been confirmed, and that
are situate within the said land district, with as little delay as
practicable ; also, a list of. the 7same kind to the receiver and
register of the district of Howard county, of all the land claims
within said district which in like manner have not been confirmed. For this service he will be entitled to a reasonable-compensation. 'You are also requested [to] direct the register and
receiver of those districts, respectively, to withhold from sale
all such lands, until otherwise directed.' It may be proper,
however, to advise those officers that this act is not to be considered as in any manner countenancing the idea that such
claims are considered equitable, or that their being withheld
from sale at this time ought to excite an expectation that they
will ultimately receive the sanction of Congress. They are
withheld from sale because the land claims have been, during
the latter end of the late session of Congress, referred to the
Secretary of the Treasury, with directions to report to the dzext
session.
The receiver and register should be insttucte to
make the subject of these observations known, for the purpose
of preventing speculation on those land claims.
"I have the honor to be your most obedient servant.

"JOSIAH MEIGs, EsQ., C. G. L. 0."
"SIR, -You

The plaintiffs likewise read in evidence the proclamation of
the President Qf the United States, dated June, 1823, and published in the summer and fall of 1823, for the sale of the public lands, on the third Monday of November in that year, at St.Louis, which were situate in the township and range in which
the land sued for in this action is situate.
The evidence being finished, the counsel for the defendant
prayed the court to give the jury the following instructions :-1. That the survey in 1806, made by Mackay, which has
been given in evidence, was made without authority of law,

Mills v. Sto'ddard et al.

and is .not evidence of the proper location of the order of survey made by th6 Lieutenant-Governor.
2. That if the jury- find, from the evidence, that the order
of survey made by the Lieutenant-Governor in favor of Mordecai Bell would not embrace any part -of the land in dispute, if
surveyed adc6rding to its terms, *then the land in dispute was
never reserved from sale, and the patent to Eustache Peltier, or
his'legal.representatives, passed the title to the land described
in such patent.
3. The reservation b- the act of Congress of 1811, in favor
of those claiming under Mordecai Bell, if any such reservation
existed, was- of the land granted to said Bell, and not of the
land surveyed by Mackay,
4. If the jury find, from the evidence, that the land sued for
in this action is not a part of the tract of land conveyed by
Mordecai Bell to James Mackay, in the deed of saia Bell given
in evidence, they will find for the defendant.
. 5. Unless the jury find, from the evidence, that Mordecai
Bell, or some person claiming under him, filed with the recorder of land titles a notice in writing stating the nature and extent of his claim, and that such notice embraced the land now
in dispute, and was filed with the recorder on the first day of
July, 1808, or prior thereto, then the land in dispute was not
reserved from sale, and the patent to Eustache Peltier, or his
legal representatives, conveyed the title to the land described
in such patent.
6. That the instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury,
-read in evidence in this case, and the list of the recorder of land titles of the unconfirmed lands, do not affect any reservation of said land in dispute from sale against the title under the
Peltier claim, as distinct from the reservation, if any there be,
by act of Congress 6f March, 1811.
7. That there can be no recovery in"this action, unless for
land which was granted to Mordecai Bell.
8. If the jury find, from the evidence, that the New Madrid
certificate, so called, in favor of Peltier, was located, embracing
the land in controversy in this suit, and that in the year eighfeen hundred and twenty-seven a patent certificate was issued
by the recorder -of land titles on such locajion, they will find
for the defendant.
9. That no.title to the land in question passed by the deed
given in evidence of lordecai Bell to James Mackay.
.hich
instructions, except the sixth, the court refused to
give, and each of them; to which refusal the defendant, by his
counsel, excepted. The court, then, of its own motion, gave
the following instruction: -

:JANUARY

TERM, 1950.

351

Mills v. Stoddard et al.

The court rejected the instructions presented on the part of the
defendant, numbered from one to nine, except the sixth, which
was given, and instructed the jury, that -the land included in
the surve.y given in evidence, made for Amos Stoddart) on the
21st of January, 1806, by James Mackay, No. 42, was reserved
from location and sale at the time Peltier's location was made,
and also at the time his patent issued; and therefore both the
location and patent are invalid-, as against the title of Amos Stoddard, or those claiming through him, to the extent that the two
claims cover the same land. And that -the land included in
lackay's survey aforesaid is the land confirmed to Amos Stoddard, or to his heirs, by the act of Congress of July 4th, 1836 ;
and that the confirmation operated as a grant to said Stoddard,
or, if he Was dead, to his heirs, such being the legal effect of
the acts of Congress, records, and title-deeds given in evidence;
nor does the evidence of the witnesses introduced in any wise
impair the effect of the acts of Congress and title papers.
To the giving of which last-mentioned instruction the defendant, by his counsel, excepted. The defendant then asked
the following instructions: 10. That there is no evidence before the jury that Mordecai
Bell, or any person claiming under him, filed with the recorder
of land titles such notice of claim according to law as was required in order that the land in question should -be considered
as reserved from sale.
11. That the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover in this action for any land embraced within the patent to Eustache Peltier, or his legal representatives, which has been given in evidence.
12. That there is no sufficient evidence that notice of the
claim of Stoddard, under Mordecai Bell, was filed with the recorder of land titles on or before the 1st day of July, 1808,
according to law.
13. If the jury find, from the evidence, that two of the plaintiffs, Anthony Stoddard and William Stoddard, conveyed their
interest in the land in question to Henry G. Cotton since this
action was brought, then the plaintiffs in this action are not entitled to recover any thing but damages down to the time of
such conveyance, and the plaintiffs cannot recover damages for
any time prior to the 4th day of July, 1836 ; and the jury are
instructed to find specially the fact of such conveyance by said
Anthony and William Stoddard, and its date.
Which the court refused to gire, to which refusal the defendant, by his counsel, exceptedr The defendant then asked
the following instruction, which the court gave, viz.:

14. That the plaintiffs cannot recover damages for possession of the premises for any time prior'to the 4th of July, 1836.

his bill of exceptions, which is done accordingly.

Under these instructions the jury found the following verdict:
" We, the jury in the above-entitled cause, find the defendant guilty of the trespass and ejectment alleged in the declaration in the above-entitled cause, as to four fifths, less one sixth
and one twelfth, of the following described piece of land, parcel of the land in said. declaration described, to wit: - A certain tract or parcel of land, situate, lying, and being in the
county of St. Louis, and bounded as follows, beginning at
the southeast corner of the location, under a New Madrid certificate issued to Eustache Peltier, or his legal representatives,
where the said corner is fixed upon the line of a tract, formerly
the Mill tract of Auguste Chouteau, deceased; thence, with
the southern line of said. location, as the same runs westwardly,
seven chains; thence, north fourteen degrees forty-five minutes east, to the Methodist burying-ground ; thence, with the
south line of the Methodist and Catholic burying-grounds, nine
chains and sixty links, to the line of the common field lots;
and thence, with the line of the common field lots (having in
it an angle), to the place of beginning : being forty acres of
land, and is bounded on the south by the land-formerly of
Auguste Chouteau, called the Mill tract; west by the land of
John F. Darby; north by the Methodist and Catholic graveyards; east by the common field lots of St. Louis. And we
further find, that the damages suffered by said plaintiffs, by
reason of said trespass and ejectment, to have been twelve hundred dollars. And we further find, that the monthly value of
,said four fifths, less one sixth and one twelfth, of said described premises, is thirty-one dollars and twenty-five cents."
Upon the above bill of exceptions, the case came up to this
court.
It was argued by Mr. Benton and -Mr. Gamble, for the
plaintiff in error, and Mr. Ewing, for the defendants in.error.
The points made by the counsel for the plaintiff in error
were the following: 1' That the Circuit Court erred in instructing the jury that
the confirmation "to Mordecai Bell, or his legal representa-

tives,"I operated as a grant to Amos Stoddard, or, if he was
dead, to his heirs.
The confirmation is in the alternative,

--.

to Bell, or his legal

representatives. Stoddard claimed as purchaser' under Bell;
the instruction, that the confirmation is a grant to Stoddard,
involves the decision by the court of all the questions of law
and fact arising upon the conveyances under which Stoddard
claimed. Wear and-Hickman v. Bryant, 5 Mo. 164.
2. Bell had no pretence of claim to the land in controversy
at the period when the United States took possession of Louisiana, nor had Mackay or Stoddard any such claim prior to the
survey in 1806.
.3. The survey made by Maakay in 1806 did not, either by
itself, or in connection with the concession, give any title to
the land in controversy, because, 1st. It was made, not only without authority of law, but contrary to express act of Congress. Act of 26th March, 1804 (2
Stat. at Large, 287); Smith's casd, 10 Peters, 326 ; Wherry's
case, Ibid. 338; Jourdan v. Barrett, 4 Howard, 169; Mackay
v. Dillon, Ibid. 448.
2d. It was a nullity, because a manifest departure from the
concession. 8 Peters, 468; 9 Peters, 171 ; 15 Peters, 173.
4. The title now set up by the heirs of Stoddard, under a
confirmation by the act of 4th July, 1836, cannot, by relation,
overreach the patent to Peltier, issued in July, 1832. Les Bois
v. Bramell, 4 Howard, 449 ; Chouteau v. Eckhart, 2 Howard,
344; Mackay v. Dillon, 7 Mo. 12.
Unless the claimants under the confirmation can show that
the Peltier patent is void, they have no shadow of right to
maintain this action of ejectment. They attempt to avoid the
patent by showing that the land was reserved from sale; and,
consequently, from appropriation by a New Madrid claim, at
the time when Peltier's location was made, and at the time
when the patent issued. They insist, that, by the proviso to
the tenth section of the act of 3d March, 1811, the land in controversy was reserved from sale, because their claim to it had
been filed, "in due time and according to law," with the recorder of land titles ; that this reservation was continued by the
act of 17th February, 1818 ; and although it is admitted that,
by the acts of 26th May, 1824, and 24th May, 1828, the reservation was terminated on the 26th of May, 1829, they insist
that it was revived by the act of the 9th July, 1832, just seven
days prior to the date of the Peltier patent.
It is necessary here to quote the words of the proviso in the
act of 1811, upon which so much stress is laid. They are as
30*

354

SUPREME COURT.
Mills v. Stoddard et al.

follows :-" That until after the decision of Congress thereon,
no tract of land shall be offered for sale, the claim to which has
been, in due time and according to law, presented to" the recorder of land titles in the district of Louisiana, and filed in his
office, for the purpose of being investigated by the commissioners appointed for ascertaining the rights of persons claiming
lands in the Territory of Louisiana."
In this case the following points are made in relation to the
alleged reservation.
1. That the proviso in question leaves to the officers, who are
to act for the government in selling the public lands, the aseertainment of the facts, - 1. That a particular tract has been
claimed; 2. That the claim has been filed'in due time; 3.
That it has been filed: according to law.
2. In this case it is insisted that there was no such notice of
the nature and extent of the claim filed by the claimant, as
was required by the acts of Congress. Acts of 2d March, 1805;
28th February, 1806; 3d March, 1807; Strother "v.Lucas, 6
Peters, 763.
3. That the questioh whether the law was pursued by the
claimant is not determined by the fact that the commissioners
acted upon the claim, inasmuch as theyacted upon claims illegally filed. Bird v. Montgomery, 6 Mo. 510.
4. The proviso reserved no land under a floating concession;
it sanctioned no survey made in violation-of .any previous act
of Congress; and the. recording of a survey, illegally made,
could have no effect whatever under this proviso.
The acts of Congress requiring the exhibition and recording
of Spanish claims are analogous to registry acts. Strother v.
Lucas, 12 Peters, 510. Recording a document, not required
by law to be recordbd, gives it no additional legal effect. 5
Shepl. 418; 23 Pick. 80 ; 3 A. K. Marsh. 220.
5. Where a claim to a tract of land had been filed and recorded- according to law, the proviso only suspended the sale
until the decision of Congress upon the report to be made by
the commissioners; and this decision was made before the location of Peltier's warrant. See Acts of 13th June, 1812;
12th April, 1814; and 29th April, 1816.
6. The act of 17th February, 1818, did not revive any reservation that had terminated.
If it could be held that there was a reservation of this land
from sale, and that such resbrvation continued to the time of
Peltier's location, still it is insisted, that, as between the confirmation to Bell and the location and patent of Peltier, the location and patent are not void.

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

355

Mills v. Stoddard et al.

The reservation is admitted to have terminated on the 26th
of May, 1829, and then Peltier's title was indisputably good.
1. The acts of the officers of the government appropriating
the land had been performed. Bagnell v. Broderick, 13 Peters,
460; Barry v. Gamble, 3 Howard, 32.
2. The. location of Peltier, thus appropriating the land, was
not, as against the government, a mere nullity, but at the utmost was only defeasible by the confirmation of a conflicting
claim during the continuance of the reservation. Stoddard v.
Chambers, 2 Howard, 284;. Carroll v. Stafford, 3 Howard, 460.
3. When the adverse claim under Mordecai Bell was, by the
act of 26th May, 1824, entirely barred, and the land declared
public land, so far as that claim was concerned, the title under
the Peltier location became unquestionable, and nu subsequent
grantee of the laud could dispute its validity. Hoofnagle v.
Anderson, 7 Wheat. 212; Stringer v. Young, 3 Peters, 320;
City of New Orleans v. D'Armas, 9 Peters, 224.
The patent issued to Peltier is dated on the 16th of July,
1832, and it was under the laws of the United States the completion of the title. Unless this document is a nullity, the
claimants under Bell cannot maintain their action.
It is.insisted by them that the act of the 9th of July, 1832,
revived the reservation which had terminated in 1829, and that,
therefore, a patent could not legally be issued after the passage of that act for the land covered by their claim.
To this I reply, that the act of 9th July, 1832, did not make
a reservation from its date, but from the time of the final report of the commissioners, which was long after the patent
issued.
Lastly, it is claimed by the plaintiff.in error that the effect
of the second section of the act of 4th July, 1836, is to protect his title against the confirmation under the first section;
and it is insisted,1. That this section is designed to protect locations and
sales that would be subject to exception, and be liable to be
defeated! by the confirmations under the first section, but for'
the protection given by the second section. Jackson v. Clark,
1 Peters, 635.
2. That a location or sale, made in conformity to the acts of
Congress, would have passed the title beyond controversy, as
against a confirmation under this act, without the aid of the
second section. Chouteau v. Eckhart, 2 Howard, 376; Les
Bois v. Bramell, 4 Howard, 449.
3. That the very defect supposed to exist in the locations
and sales intended to be protected was, that the land was reserved from sale when the locations and sales were made.

356

SUPItEME COURT.
Mills v. Stoddard et al.

Ar. Ewing, for defendants in error.
This is in effect the case of Stoddard v. Chambers, reported. in
2 Howard, 284. The suit below was against another defendant
residing on the same tract, and the evidence is substantially
the same as in the reported case, to which, and to the authorities there cited, and the points of law decided by the court, I
beg leav6 to refer.
It was held in that case that the location "under any law,"
saved in the second section of the act of confirmation of July
Ath, 1836, must be a location in conformity with it; and unless
the location of the defendant shall have been made agreeably
to law, or the patent were so issued, the reservation does not.
affect the title of the plaintiffs. (p.317.) And that the location of the New Madrid warrant, being made on lands reserved
from-sale, was not authorized, but forbidden, by law. The saving was therefore held not to protect the claimant under
the warrant. Against this decision I -understand it will be
urged,1st. That the court, to give the saving effect, and thus conform to the intent of the legislature, must apply it to this class
of cases, there being no, others, as it is said, to Which it can
apply.:
This is a mistake in point of fact. From May 26th, 1829,
to. July 9th, 1832, there was no reservation of these lands from
sale or location; and during part of this time the law allowed
the location of New Madrid warrants. The saving would very
-properly apply to a location made during that time, which,
without it, would not, prevail against the confirmation, by
law, of the elder title. .
2d. That the opinion of the bar in Missouri was general in
favor of the validity of New Madrid locations upon these reserved lands, and that in faith of such opinions many titles
were acquired, which ought not to be disturbed.
This, also, is not correct in point of fact. Some of the ablest
members of the bar, whose opinions I have seen; held these
locations invalid. Indeed, there was a degree of boldness in
the attempt 'to seize upon these lands by virtue of the*New
Madrid, warrants, and a contempt of legal prohibition, which
cannot fail to command our admiration. These New Madrid
warrants were a charity; the law forbade their location on lands
before they should be surveyed and offered for sale; and it
again forbade- their location on' the lands claimed under Spanish
concessions, until those claims should be finally adjusted. This
location, with the rest that are in like jeopardy, was made
against this double prohibition. (See the letters of Mr. Wirt,

Millsv. Stoddard et al.

Attorney-General, to Mr. Crawford, of May 11, and June 19,
1820, Gilpin's Collection of Opinions, pp. 263 and 273.)
So far as the government itself was concerned, the wrong
was submitted to, and a law was enacted, April 26, 1823, ch.
40, sanctioning locations which had been made before survey.
But no law ever did the injustice to sanction these' illegal locations on the property claimed under the concessions. Our
legislators were not at first familiar with the laws hnd policy
of Spain, or her mode of making these grants; they were,
therefore, long held open for consideration, and the laws sternly
forbade the creation, under their authority, of other titles, which
might put it out of the power of the government to do what at
last might be found to be an act of justice, and a performance of
treaty stipulation. This prohibition was distinctly understood,
while these New Madrid titles were in fieri. See the opinion
of Mr. Wirt, Attorney-General, October 10, 1825, (Opinions,
&c., Vol. 11. p. 25,) refers to letters of Mr. Crawford, June 10,
1818; Mr. Wirt, October 22, 1828; Mr. Butler, AttorneyGeneral, August 8,, 1838 (Opinions, &c., Vol. II. p. 1045).
The opinion that titles thus acquired were valid was, as far
as I have been able to ascertain, confined to those who were
engaged in their acquisition, and their counsel, and to such additional public opinion as interested parties Were able to create.
But let the opinion be as extensive as it might, it can avail
nothing in this court; it was contrary to plain law and right,
and this is the place to correct it.
3d. It is said that an adherence to the decision in the case of
Stoddard v. Mills will disturb many titles; that much property
is held under these New Madrid locations, made upon Spanish
concessions,, which have been since confirmed, while they were
thus reserved from location.
I know not how the fact is, as few such cases have come
under my notice; but if it be so, it is entitled to no weight
with this court. Whether there have been much or little property thus illegally taken, it ought all to be restored to its lawful owners. It was taken by those who knew, at the time,
that their acts were illegal, and that they werd attempting to
seize what the law had reserved for others. They played for
a stake, putting up a warrant worth but a trifle against a tract
of land of great value. They have lost, and should be compelled to stand the hazard of the die.
4th. It is said, also, that the confirmation of these titles by
the act of July 4, 1836, was a mere gift, and ought not to be
considered favorably.
I contend, on the contrary, that it was an act of justice done

358

SUPREME COURT.
Mills v. Stoddard et al.

in execution of a treaty stipulation. Such is the ground on
which'it is put by the act of July 9th, 1832, and by the commissioners who examined these claims and recommended them
for confirmation. Those who have become familiar with these
concessions, and with the early value of such property, the
state of the country, and the policy of Spain as to her colonies, are* satisfied that form was necessarily and habitually
dispensed with; and that, if the United States had not acquired
the sovereignty, the class of titles that were sanctioned by the
law of confirmation would have become, or been made, -valid
by the existing government. It was thought with reason, that,
independently of treaty stipulation, the inhabitants ought not
to suffer in their property by the transfer of the sovereignty to
the United States.
On the other hand, the New Madrid warrants were a mere
charity.
The particular objections to be urged in this case, and which
did not arise out of the evidence, in the case of Stoddard v.
Chambers, I understand, are, 1st. That certain depositions offered by plaiitiffs below were
improperly admitted.
The court, on the 4th day of April; 1844, established the
following rule, which is still in force: "Ordered, that all exceptions to depositions, other than exceptions to the competency or relevancy of the evidence therein contained, shall'be in writing, and filed, and notice thereof
given a reasonable time before trial, and shall be taken up and
disposed of before the jury are sworn ifi the cause, or the trial
commenced; and no exceptions to depositions, other than to
the competency ox relevancy of the evidence therein contained,
shall be allowed on the trial of the cause."
" Depositions offered by the plaintiffs below, to prove heirship,
were objected to for informality in the taking, but admitted by
th c6urt under the above rule. The depositions were filed in
court in the May term, 1840. They.were not objected to on
the former trial of the cause, nor until the 31st day of March,
1846,-a few days before the cause was again called for trial,
when the objections were noted, and notice given to the plaintiffs' counsel. The court held that this notice was not given a
"reasonable time before trial," taking into view all the circumstances of the case.
The correctness of this decision seems to me self-evident. It
was not "reasonable"' to suffer those depositions to remain four
years on file without objection, and then take exception to them
for form merely, at such time as would compel a continuance

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

359

Mills v. Stoddard et al.

of the cause, to the great inconvenience of counsel and with expense to the parties, especially as nothing was to be gained by
it except this inconvenience and expense.
2d. That the conveyance by two of the plaintiffs of their interest in the land, after action brought, bars the recovery in
ejectment as to all, and that the court erred in not so instructing the jury.
If this were an action of trespass in legal effect, as it is in
form, the conveyance by the two plaintiffs would not disturb
the case in the slightest degree. The sale of the land is not a
release of the action; and if it were, the release must have been
specially pleaded, puis darrein continuance, or it could not
have been given in evidence.
But this action, wronged and mutilated as it is, is still ejectment, and the court will deal with it according to its substance,
without regard to the form which it is constrained to assume.
In this action the courts have long done on the trial, and on
motion, what, in other real actions, used to be done by summons and severance; that is to say, they have freed the case of
parties who ceased to have an interest in its prosecution. This
was done here by nonsuiting the plaintiffs who had sold their
ifiterest, and striking their names out of the declaration, and
taking a verdict in behalf of the other plaintiffs for their remaining interest.
This practice is in strict analogy to that in the action of ejectment, where the nominal plaintiff counts on several demises
from tenants in common; and the court on the trial, or even on
motion in arrest of judgment, allow the demises of some of the
lessors, who have shown no title on the trial, to be stricken
from the declaration. Van Ness v. Bank of United States, 13
Peters, 17.
The court having directed that the names of two of the plaintiffs be stricken out of the declaration, it is not necessary to
erase the record. Lessee of Walden v. Craig's Heirs, 14 Peters,
147. The direction stands for the act.
At common law, the summons and severance was resorted to
in all real actions, where one of the parties plaintiff was for any
reason"unable or unwilling to proceed in the case.
"It lies in waste because the land is to be recovered." 20
Vin. Abr. 51. "It lies in right of ward of land." "In right
of ward of body and land." "In detinue of charters, for peradventure he (the plaintiff) is to recover a warrantee by it."
So, generally, in actions real or mixed." 20 Vin., ubi supra.
It lies also in quare impedit, and a writ of error upon it." Pipe
v. Dominam Reginam, Cro. Eliz. 325.

SUPREME

COURT.

MXills v. Stoddard et al.

In modern practice, the summons and severance is seldom
used, but in cases where it has heretofore applied, the court proceed on motion. In the case at bar it would have been very
idle to summon and sever, when the parties were all present by
their counsel, and ready to sever by nonsuit.
But, be the mode adopted to get clear of the parties who had
sold their interest right or wrong, it was for them only, and not
for defendants below,' to complain of it. The defendants were
not injured by any irregularity, if there was any. It would be
a reproach upon the law to say, that there was no way in which
this could be done; and no one, I think, can devise a better than
that which was adopted by the court below. Choutean v. United States, 9 Peters, 144,153; Hunter v. Hemphill, 6 Mo. 119;
United States v. Percheman, 7 Peters, 90, 91.
- To the objection, that the location was a departure from the
concession, I answer, 1st. That it is immaterial if it were so; for, the location having been made,,the survey filed with the claim became a part
of it., Altogether, it was the claim; and whether good or bad,
it was not for a stranger, but for the United States, to determine. This land, then, was claimed; and being so, was reserved from sale by the act of 1811. Finally, the Board of
Commissioners, and Congress acting on their report, determined
that the land ought to be held according to the survey.
2d. But the location was in pursuance of the concession.
The translation of De Mun conveys the true meaning of the
petition; that of Renard does not, though it may translate
each French word literally into an equivalent English word.
Their disagreement is in the translation and explanation of the
clause in which Bell represents, "que avec l'agrement de votre
predecesseur il se transporter sur cette rive, oji il a choisi une
morceau de terre, &c.
De Mun, a contemporary, resident at the time in Louisiana,
translates and explains the passage thus: -" That, with the
consent of your predecessor, he came over to this side (of the
Mississippi), where he selected a piece of land," &c.
Renard translates it, "That he, with the consent of your predecessor, has come over to this shore, where he has selected a
tract of land," &c.; and by the context, as expounded by'counsel, makes it the "shore" of the Missouri, and not of the Mississippi, to which he has come with this assent.
That it was the Mississippi, and not the Missouri, which he
crossed with the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, is certain.
The Mississippi bounded the Spanish territory on the east, but
the Missouri was entirely within it; he might cross- the Missouri at pleasure, without such assent,- not the -Mississippi.

JANUARY

Mills v. Stoddard et al.
Again, why say, "ilse transporter sur cette rive oZL il a choisi, &c., "rive sud du Missouri ?" Why 1'ette rive" and "Tive
sud,". with the addition of Missouri in the same sentence; if
both meant the same thing, or if Missouri were understood in
the first branch of the sentence? But it is very clear from the
text itself that they me.ant different things. De Mun's knowledge of the boundary of Lbuisiana, and the laws touching immigration, enabled him to explain that difference. "1Cette rive"
means this side of the Mississippi. It may be north or south of
the Missouri, for his Majesty had domains on both sides of that
river; but 11R. S. du Missouri," (rive sud,) defines the side
north or south of that river, on which he prays for a concession. But neither "1cette rive" nor "rive sud" means shore,
in its most restricted sense, -the water's edge, or the riverbank. Its whole sense, text, and context show, that it was to
this side of the Mississippi which he had come, not confining
himself to the water's edge; and it was on the south side of
the Missouri, in an equaly large sense, as contradistinguished
from the north, that he asked permission to locate the warrant
which he prays for.
Indeed, the very fact that initials are used, (M. R. S.,) shows
that the expression occurred frequently, and De Mun, a contemporary, gives its conventional meaning.
Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiffs brought an action of ejectment in the Circuit
Court, to recover three hundred and fifty arpens of land in the
neighbourhood of St. Louis, which they claim under a concession made. by the Spanish government, in 1800, to Mordecai
Bell. Bell conveyed his right to James Macxay on the 20th
of May, 1804, and on the 20th of September, 1805, Mackay
conveyed the same to Amos Stoddard, the ancestor of the plaintiffs. A plat and certificate of the survey were certified and recorded by Antoine Soulard, as Surveyor-General, the 20th of
January, 1806.
On the 29th of June, 1808, the above papers were iled with
the recorder' of land titles for the district of St. Louis. The
claim was .duly presented to the Board of Commissioners, under
the acts of Congress, and rejected on the 10th of October, 1811;
but afterwards, on the 8th of June, 1835, a new board decided
that three hundred and fifty arpens of land "ought to be confirmed to the said Mordecai Bell, or his legal representatives,
according to the survey on record." On the 4th of July, 1836,
an act of Congress was passed, confirming the decision of the
commissioners. The land was surveyed as confirmed. The
VOL. VIl.

SUPREME COURT.
Mills v. Stoddard et al.

defendant admitted that he was in possession of forty acres of
the land claimed at the commencement of the suit.
The title of the defendant was founded on an entry made by
Peltier of one hundred and sixty acres of land, by virtue of a
New Madrid certificate, on the 24th of October, 1816.t A survey of the entry was made in March, 1818, and a patent to Peltier was issued on the 16th of July, 1832. Possession has been
held of' the forty acres claimed by the defendant, and by those
under whom he claims, since 1819. This title was conveyed
to the defendant.
The township in which this land is situated was surveyed
by the United States in 1817, 1818, and 1819, and was examined in 1822. In 1823, the proclamation of the President, published at St. Louis, directed the lands in the above township to
be offered at public sale.
This title, with but little variation of facts, was asserted by
the plaintiffs, and duly considered by this court, in the case of
Stoddard's Heirs v. Chambers, 2 How. 284. And the court
held the title to be valid against that which is no*r set up by
the defendant. In the case of Barry v. Gamble, 3 How. 53,
that decision was sanctioned. But the counsel for the defendant, having brought the same title before us in this case, have
requested a reexamination of the points ruled in the case of
Chambers. We will briefly refer to the points now made, and
to the new facts proved, on which this application is founded.
The court instructed the jury, "that the land included in the
survey given in evidence, made for Amos Stoddard on the 21st
of January, 1806, by James Mackay, No. 42, was reserved from
location and sale at the time Peltier's location was made, and
also at the time his patent issued; and, therefore, both the
location and patent are invalid, as against the title of Amos
Stoddard, or those claiming through him, to the extent that the
two claims cover the same land. And that the land included
in Mackay's survey, aforesaid is the land confirmed' to Amos
Stoddard, or to his heirs, by the act of Congress of July 4th,
1836," &c.
It is objected, that the concession granted to Mordecai Bell
should have been located at St. Andre, and not in the vicinity
of St. Louis. In his petition to the Lieutenant-Governor of
Upper Louisiana, he states, "with the consent of your predecessor, he came over to this side [of the Mississippi], where he
has selected a piece of land in his Majesty's domain, on the
south side of the Missouri. 'This being considered, he supplicates you to have the goodness to grant him, at the same place,
for the support of his family, three hundred and fifty arpens-

JANUARY TERM, 1850.
Mills v. Stoddard et al.

363

•

of land in superficie." This bears date 21st January, 1800;
and on the 29th of the same month the Lieutenant-Governor
responds, - " In consequence of the information of the command'ant of St. Andre, Don Santiago Mackay, I do grant to the
petitioner the tract of land of three hundred and fifty arpens
in superficie," &c., "in the place indicated."
St. Andre, the place of Bell's residence, is situated on the
south side of the Missouri River, about thirty miles from St.
Louis. Pascal L. Cerr6, a witness, states that Bell resided in
the neighbourhood of St. Andre several years, and was engaged
in hunting, drinking, and playing cards, and led a sort of vagabond life; that his petition, except the mark of the signature
of Bell, was in the handwriting of Mackay. And Bell, being
sworn as a witness, says he never applied for a concession, nor
was there, to his knowledge, any grant made to him. That
Mackay told him he had a head right which he, Mackay, wished
to obtain, and which the witness exchanged with him for a
tract of land near St. Andre.
Instead of the word "(Mississippi)," included in brackets in the
petition of Bell, it seems the letters M. R. S. were used, which
one of the witnesses considers "as put for Majeste Rive Sud";
and Milburn, a surveyor, says, that he should have surveyed
the concession on the south bank of the Missouri River, if not
otherwise directed. In opposition to this View, the words of
the petitioner are relied on, "1that with the consent of your
predecessor, he came over to this side of the M. R. S.," which
could only have meant the Mississippi River, that river being
the eastern limit of Louisiana, which extended far north of the
Missouri. That to cross the Missouri River, the "leave of his
predecessor" could not have been asked, as it was unnecessary.
Whatever doubts this evidence may have created, as to the
location of Bell's concession, had it been laid before the commissioners who acted upon the claim, it is now too late to
affect the title under it. In regard to the statement of Bell, his
conveyance of the land in controversy to Mackay shows, at
least, the inaccuracy of his memory. But the survey of the
concession in 1806, as now claimed, which survey was recorded and expressly confirmed by the commissioners on the 8th
of June, 1835, is a sufficient answer to the above objection.
The survey was a private one, and consequently was of no authority except to designate the locality and extent of the claim,
until sanctioned by the commissioners. By the act of the 21st
of April, 1806, they were authorized to direct such surveys as
they may think necessary for the purpose of deciding on claims
presented for their decision; and under this power they had a

364

SUPREME COURT.
Mills v. Stoddaa- et al.

right to adopt private surveys of claims, if accurately executed.
This was in pursuance of the instructions of the Secretary of
the Treasury.
The great question in the case is, whether the land in controversy was subject to be appropriated by a New Madrid
warrant on the 20th of October, 1826, when Peltier made his
location.
Under various acts of Congress up to the 26th of May, 1829,
Spanish or French titles which had been duly filed by the
recorder of land titles were reserved from sale. Those acts are
referred to in the case of Stoddard v. Chambers. At that period,
all claims which had not received the sanction of the government were barred. On the 9th of July, 1832, an act was passed
"for the final adjustment of land titles in Missouri," which
provided that the recorder of land titles, with two commissioners to be appointed, should examine all the unconfirmed claims
to land in Missouri, which had heretofore been filed in the
office of the said recorder, according to law, founded upon any
French or Spanish grant, &c., issued prior to the 10th of
March, 1804." And they were required to class the claims so
as to "state in the first class what claims, in their opinion,
should in fact have been confirmed, according to the laws,
usages, and customs of the Spanish government, and the practice of the Spanish tuthorities under them; and secondly, what
claims, in their opinion, are destitute .of merit, law, or equity."
And after the report, the lands in the first class shall continue
to be reserved from sale as heretofore, until the decision of
Congress shall be made against them; but the second class was
declared to be subject to sale as other public lands.
This act reserved from sale, necessarily, all claims which bad
been duly filed, until the final report of the commissioners; and
those which were embraced in the first class, until Congress
should reject them. In the case of Stoddard v. Chambers, the
court say, in reference to Peltier's location, - "It was made on
land not liable to be thus appropriated, but which was expressly
reserved; and this was the case when the patent was issued.
Had the entry been made, or the patent been issued, after the
26th of May, 4829, -when the reservation ceased, and before it
was revived by the act of 1832, the title of the defendant could
not be contested.
But at no other interval of time, from the
location of Bell until its confirmation in 1836, was the land
claimed by him liable to be appropriated in satisfaction of a
New Madrid warrant."
The defendants' counsel suppose, that, if the location of the
New Madrid claim was void, the patent, though issued within

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

365

Mills v. Stoddard et al.

the time above stated, could have conveyed no title. The New
Madrid location was -void because it interfered with the Spanish
title. When that title was barred by the lapse of time, the
government, by issuing of a patent, would have sanctioned the
New Madrid claim, and no one could have contested it, - as
between the government and the claimant no controversy could
exist. By the patent, he only acquired what his certificate entitled him to. And the right, thus made complete, could
not have been affected by any subsequent act of Congress.
The' government might have withheld the patent, on the
ground that the New Madrid certificate had been improperly
located; but that not being done, the patent gave an indisputable title.
It is insisted that the New Madrid location, if made on lands
reserved from sale by reason of the Spanish claim, became
valid, so soon as the bar was complete against that claim. But
this consequence would not seem to follow. If, during the
bar, no act was done by the government to confirm the New
Madrid claim, nor by the claimant to perfect his title, a removal
of the bar would not prejudice any newly acquired right. And
this only could prevent the renewal of the reservation by Congress. " By such a rengwal, a preference was given to the
Spanish claim, which was an exercise of legislative discretion.
Congress might have excepted from this reservation lands
covered by New Madrid locations; but this not having been
done, the Spanish claim was revived, and placed on the same
footing as before the bar.
It is insisted, that, as Bell's concession was surveyed without
authority, it was no notice to Peltier, though recorded. The
act of 1806, as before remarked, authorized the commissioners
to direct such surveys as they may think necessary to be executed', for the purpose of deciding on claims presented for their
decision; but where a private survey had been made, they had
the power to adopt it, as was done in this case. And such survey, being placed upon record by the recorder, seems to have
been a reasonable notice, within the acts of Congress.
Bt it is contended, that the proviso in the act of 1836,
which confirmed the Spanish and French claims reported by
the commissioners, embraces Peltier's New Madrid location.
The words of the proviso are, "that if it should be found that
any tract confirmed, or any part thereof, had been previously
locatdd by any other person or persons, under any law of the
United States, or had been surveyed or sold by the United
States, that act should confer no title on such lands, in opposition to the rights acquired by such location or purchase."

366

SUPREME COURT.
Caldwell v. The United States.

In the case of Stoddard v. Chambers, this court held, that
"a location under the law of the United States" must be "in
conformity with it." But this, it is insisted, is not the true
construction of the proviso. That "under the law" does not
mean, "in pursuance of it," or "in conformity with it," but an
act assumed to be done under it.
The word under has a great variety of meanings. But the
sense in-which it-was used in the proviso is, "subject to the
law." We are under the laws of the United States, that is,
we are subject to those laws. We live under a certain jurisdiction, that is, we are subject to it. The proviso declares,
that the act shall not confer a title, "in opposition to the rights
acquired under the laws of the United States." This would
seem to be conclusive, as no right can be acquired under a law
which is not in pursuance of it. If the New'Madrid location
was made in violation of the law, it is n6t perceived how any
right could be acquired under it.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the

ED,IuxD B. CALDWELL, SURVIVING PARTNER OF JADIEs LYND, JR. AND
COIMPANY, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, v. THE UNITED STATES.

In this case, the court below instructed the jury, that, if the goods were fraudulently
entered, it was no matter in whose possession they were when seized, or whether
the United States had made an election between the penalties, and that the forfeiture took place when the fraud, if any, was committed, and' the seller of the
goods could convey no title to the purchaser.
.
This instruction was right in respect to the sixty-eighth section of the act of 1799
(1 Stat. at Large, 677), as the penalty is the forfeiture of the goods without an alternative of their value, but wrong as the instruction applies to the sixty-sixth section
of the same act, - as the forfeiture under it is either the goods or their value.
Under the sixty-eighth section, the forfeiture is the statutory transfer of right to the
goods at the time the offence is committed. The title of the United States to the
goods forfeited is not consummated until after judicial condemnation, but the
rigid to them relates backwards to the time the offence was committed, so as to
avoid all intermediate sales of them between the commission of the offence and
condemnation.
But under the sixty-sixth section of the act, in which the forfeiture is the goods or,
their value, the United Stat;s have no title in the goods, until an election has been
