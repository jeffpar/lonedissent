THE DECISIONS

THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
AT

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

THE

UNITED STATES, APPELLANTS, V. BURROUGHS E. CARR AND
JOHN PECK, CLAIMANTS OF SIXTE9N BoXEs OF HAVANA SUGAR,
TWELVE BASKETS OF CHAMPAGNE WINE, &C.

THE UNITED STATES, APPELLANTS, V. BURROUGHS B. CARR AND
JOHN PECK, CLAIIANTS OF TEN BoXES, TWENTY HALF-BoxEs,
AND SIX QUARTER-BoxEs OF RAISINS, FOUR KEGS OF GRAPES, &C.

The sixteenth section of the act of Congress, passed on the 18th of February, 1793,'
entitled "An act for enrolling and licensing ships or vessels to be employed in
the coasting trade and fisheries, and for regulating the same," (I Stat. at Large,
305,) prescribes the manner in which foreign merchandise shall be specified in the
manifest of' a vessel going coastwise, and- imposes a pecuniary penalty upon the
master for failing to comply with it; but does not forfeit 'he goods.
The forfeiture provided in the seventeenth section was intended to apply to cases
where the foreign merchandise was not inclnded at all in the manifest, and not to
cases where it was included in fact, although not with legal precision, and where
there was.no bad faith.
The etof May 31st 1844, (5 Stat. at Large, 6518,) jives jurisdiction to this court
in revenue cases, without regard to amount, only where the judgment is rendered
in a Circuit Court of the United States. Therefore, where the case was brought
from the Court of Appeals for the Territory of Florida, and the amount in controversy did not exceed one thousand dollars, the case must be dismissed for
want of jurisdiction.
THESE two cases were brought, by appeal, from the Court

of Appeals for the Territory of Florida, and were argued together. The questions involved were the same in both.
The first of the two cases was this.
In January, 1844, the schooner Hope W. Gaudy was about
to sail from the port of New York to that of St. Augustine
in Florida, the vessel being licensed for carrying on the coasting trade. Maurice Gaudy, the captain of the schooner, produced to the collector of New York the following manifest,

On the 29th of January, 1844, the District Attorney of the
United States filed, in the Superior Court for the District of
East Florida, a libel against "sixteen boxes of sugar, twelve
baskets of Champagne wine, twenty-five sacks of Liverpool
salt, five cases and five baskets of olive oil, ten boxes of French
cordial, seven casks of London porter, two casks of Scotch ale,

two half-pipes of French brandy, one pipe Holland gin, thirty
half-boxes and twenty-folr quarter-boxes of raisins, ten bags of
cassia, two boxes of citron, five chests of tea, one frail (or basket) of almonds, three drums of figs, two boxes of lemons, and
ten bags of coffee."
The libel alleged that the said merchandise was not (nor
was any part thereof) specified or certified in the manifest of
the cargo of the said vessel, as is required'by the act of the
Congress of the same United States, in such case made and
provided, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made
and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the United
States of America.
The libel then claimed that the merchandise had become
forfeited to the uses specified by law.
In March, 1844, Burroughs and Carr filed their claim as owners of the goods. After sundry proceedings whibh it is not material to state, the cause came up for hearing, when the judge
dismissed the libel. The United States carried it to the Court
of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the court below.
An. appeal was then taken to- this court.
The act of Congress under which the libel was filed was the
act of 18th February, 1793, entitled "An act for enrolling and
licensing ships or vessels to be employed in the coasting trade
and fisheries, and for regulating the same." 1 Statutes at
Large, 305.
By the sixteenth section, it is enacted, that "the master
or commander of every ship or vessel licensed for carrying on
the coasting trade, and being destined from any district of the
United States to a district other than a district in the same or
an adjoining State on the sea-coast, or. on a navigable river,
shall, previous to her departure, deliver to the collector residing
at the port where such ship or vessel may be, if there is one,
otherwise to the collector of the district comprehending such
port, or to a surveyor within the district, as the one or the other may reside nearest to the port at which such ship or vessel
may be, duplicate manifests of the whole cargo on board such
ship or vessel, or if there be no cargo on board, he shall so certify; and if there be any distilled spirits, or goods, wares, and
merchandise of foreign growth or manufacture on boiid, other
than what may by the collector be deemed sufficient for sea
stores, he shall specify in such manifests the marks and numbers of every cask, bag, box, chest, or package containingthe
same, with the name and place of 'residence of every shipper
and consignee of such distilled spirits, or goods of foreign
growth or manufacture, and the quantity shipped by and for

each, to be by him subscribed, and to the truth of which he
shall swear or affirm; and shall also swear or affirm, before the
said collector or surveyor, that such goods, wares, or merchandise, of foreign growth or manufacture,. were to the best of his
knowledge and belief legally imported, and the duties thereupon paid or secured; or if spirits distilled within the United
States, that the duties thereupon have been duly paid or secured; upon the performance of which, and not before, the said
collectoror surveyor shall certify the same on the said manifests, one of which he shall return to the master, with a permit
thereto annexed, authorizing him to proceed to the port of'his
destination. And if any such ship or vessel shall depart from
the port where she may then be, having distilled spirits, or
goods, wares, or merchandise of foreign growth or manufacture on board, without the several things herein required .being
complied with, the master thereof shall forfeit one hundred dollars ; or if the lading be of goods the growth or manufacture of.
the United States only, or if such ship or vessel have no cargo,
and shle.depart without the several things herein required being complied with, the said master shall forfeit and pay fifty
dollars."
And by the seventeenth section it is'enacted, that "the master or commander of every ship or vessel licensed to carry on
the coasting trade, arriving at any district of the United States,
from any district other than a district in the same or an adjoining State on the sea-coast, or on a navigable river, shall deliver
to the collector residing at the port she may arrive at, if there
be one, otherwise to the collector or surveyor in the district
comprehending such'port, as the one or the other may reside
nearest thereto, if the collector or surveyor reside at a distance
not exceeding five miles, within twenty-four hours, or if at a
greater distance, within forty-eight hours next after his arrival,
and previous to the unlading any of the goods brought in such
ship or vessel, the manifest of the cargo, (if there be any,) certified by the collector or surveyor of the district from whence
she last sailed, and shall make oath or affirmation, before the
said collector or surveyor, that there was not, when she sailed
from the district where his manifest was certified, or has been
since, or then is, any more or other goods, wares, or merchandise -of foreign growth or manufacture, or distilled spirits (if
there be any other than sea stores on board such vessel) than
is therein mentioned; and if there be no such goods, and if
there be no cargo on board, he shall produce the certificate of
the collector or surveyor of the district from which she last
sailed as aforesaid, that such is the case; whereupon such col-

The United States v. Carr et al.

lector or surveyor shall grant a permit for unlading the whole
or part of such cargo (if there be any) within his district, as
the master may request; and where a part only of the goods,
wares, and merchandise of foreign growth or manufacture, or
of distilled spirits, brought in such ship or vessel, is intended
to be landed, the said collector or surveyor shall make an indorsement of such part on the back of the manifest, specifying
the articles to be. landed; and shall return such manifest to the
master, indorsing also thereon his permission for such ship or
vessel to proceed to the place of her destination. And if the
master of such ship or vessel shall neglect or refuse to deliver
the manifest, (or if she has no cargo, the certificate,) within the
time herein directed, he shall forfeit 'one hundred dollars; and
the goods, wares, and merchandise of foreign growth or manufacture, or distilled spirits, found on board, or landed from such
ship or vessel, not being certified as is herein required, shall, be
forfeited, and if the same shall amount to the value of one hundred dollars, such ship or vessel, with her tackle, apparel, and
furniture, shall be also forfeited."
The second of the two cases mentioned in the commencement of this report was similar in its circumstances to the case
just stated, except that the goods were brought to St. Augustine in a different vessel, and that the value of the goods was
shown by appraisement to be only seventy dollars.
The cases were argued by Mr. Johnson (Attorney-General),
for the United States, and by Mr. Wood, of New York, for the
claimants.
Mr. Johnson said that three questions were involved in the
case:

-

1. Whether the manifest of itself was a sufficient compliance with the sections above quoted of the act of Congress.
2. Whether, if defective, the defect is cured by the certificate of the collector of New York.
3. Whether, if the manifest be in violation of the act, the
defect works a forfeiture of the goods.
1st. The manifest was not made out according to law. The
16th section regulates the conduct of the master at the port of
departure. He must deliver to the collector a duplicate manifest of his cargo; and must also, if there is any merchandise
on board of foreign growth or manufacture, specify the marks
and numbers of every cask, bag, box, &c., containing such articles. The object of this is to enable the collector at the port
of destination to identify these boxes as being the same which
He must also
had once paid duties at the custom-house.
I*

SUPREME COURT.
The-United States v. Carr et aL

make oath that the goods were legally imported. All this being done, the collector is authorized to give him a permit of
departure. But it must be evident from an inspection of the
record, that the master has not complied with the law. , The
manifest only says 1,814 packages of merchandise. What was
there to prevent the master from substituting other packages,
exchanged at sea, for those which he had on board at the time
of his departure from New York? The act requires a distinct
specification of all the marks on all the boxes. But here it is
not even stated whether they contain foreign merchandise or
not. The collector at New York could also refer to the marks
on the boxes, and ascertain, by the records of his office, whether or not such boxes had been regularly imported; but if the
construction contended for on the other side be correct, smug-gled goods could be transported coastwise just as easily as
those which had paid duties.
2d. The certificate of the collector at New York does not heal
this defect. He is only authorized to certify in case all the
requisitions of law are complied with. If his certificate is
conclusive, then he is invested with judicial power, and neither
the collector of the port to which the vessel is going, nor the
district judge, can properly interfere.
The manifest is no
longer subject to their supervision; although the authority of
the first collector to certify is limited to the case of previous
compliance with the law ork the part of the master. The 16th
section says, if 'he (the master) shall depart "without the
several things herein required being complied with," &c. ;
showing that a compliance with a part would not be sufficient.
The power of the collector of New York was therefore limited,
and his certificate could not heal the defect in the manifest.
3d. Are the goods subject to forfeiture ?
The last paragraph of the 17th section must be construed
to refer to the 16th. It says that the "Imerchandise, not being
certified as is herein required," shall be forfeited, and in certain
cases the vessel also. But if we show that the merchandise is
iot certified as the 16th section requires, the forfeiture attaches.
Mr. Wood made the following points :. 1. The manifest in these cases is correct, and made out according to long-established usage.
* 2. It is sufficient, under the 16th and 17th sections of the
act of 18th February, 1793, to insert in the manifest the marks
and numbers of the casks, boxes, packages, &c.,. containing
foreign merchandise, with the name and residence of every
shipper and consignee thereof, and the quantity-shipped by and
to each.

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

The United States v. Carr et al.

3. All this is done in the manifest in this cause.
4. This provision of the act.necessarily and impliedly requires that the foreign merchandise from one shipper to a consignee shall be distinguished from every other consignment,
when either the consignee or shipper, or both, are different, but
it does not require that the foreign and domestic merchandise
consigned by any one shipper to any one consignee shall'be so
differently numbered and marked as that the foreign merchandise can, by the numbers and marks, be distinguished from the
domestic merchandise.
5. Such distinction in the manifest between the marking
and numbering of foreign and domestic merchandise, consigned by one and the same shipper to one and the same consignee,
has never been made in practice, and the long-established usage
must be considered as settling the constinction of the act.
6. The manifest in question is conformable to the most approved precedents. (See American Lex Mercatoria, Appendix.)
7. Assuming that the manifest ought to have been more
specific, and so as to distinguish between the foreign and domestic merchandise consigned by one and the same shipper to
one and the same consignee, yet the certificate of the collector thereon, and the oath of the master, being correct; and according to the provisions of the said 16th section, the .goods
are not forfeited under the 17th section of said act, but the
master only is subjected to the forfeiture of one hundred dollars under the said 16th section.
8. The forfeiture of the goods under the 17th section is confined to the case where the goods, are not certified as required.
9. Penal laws are to be strictly construed, and the interpretation of revenue laws is in favor of the subject, especially
in the case of forfeiture of goods for acts not done by the owner thereof. Hubbard v. Johnstone, 3 Taunt. 177; Chests Tea
v. U. States, 1 Paine, 499.
10. The legislature, in applying the pecuniary penalty upon
the master to any defect in the manifest and certificate in the
particulars enumerated in the 16th section, and in limiting the
forfeiture of the goods to the prejudice of the owner thereof,
in the 17th section, to a defect in the certificate, clearly meant
to narrow the ground of forfeiture of the goods, and to confine
it to a case, of a defect in the certificate, per se.
11. if every defect in the manifest should be deemed to extend to the certificate, and to render that defective by relation,
so as to cause a forfei.ture of the goods to the owner, it would
confound the distinction clearly drawn by the act between the

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Carr et al.

two cases, and would deprive the owner of the goods of those
salutary rules of construction above referred to.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.
The first of these cases arises upon a libel filed in the Superior
Court for the District of East Florida, against certain goods
which were brought into the port of St. Augustine, in the
schooner Hope W. Gaudy, and there seized by the collector
as forfeited, for an alleged violation of the revenue laws. The
appellants appeared as claimants; and at the trial in the Superior Court, the libel was dismissed, and the decree of dismissal afterwards affirmed in the Court of Appeals for the Territory
of Florida. From this last-mentioned decree the United States
appealed to this court.
The Hope W. Gaudy was regularly licensed to carry on the
coasting trade; and the goods in question were part of a cargo
shipped at New 'York for the port of St. Augustine. The master of the schooner, previous to his sailing from New York, delivered a manifest of his cargo to the collector, in which the
goods seized were included, with the proper affidavit annexed;
and the collector indorsed upon it the certificate and permit to
proceed on the voyage, as required by the act of February 18,
1793. This manifest, so certified and indorsed, was in due
time after the arrival of the vessel delivered to the collector of
St. Augustine.
There is no imputation of bad faith in this transaction, upon
the master or owners, or any of the parties concerned. But
the forfeiture was supposed to have been incurred by a breach
of the provisions of the 16th and 17th sections of the act of
Congress above mentioned. Part of. the cargo consisted of
foreign merchandise. And it was insisted, on the part of the
United States, that this portion of it was not marked and described in the manifest, in the manner required by the 16th
section, and was on that account liable to seizure and forfeiture
at the port of destination.
We do not think it material to inquire whether the manifest
did or did not describe with legal precision the foreign merchandise which the master had taken on board when he sailed
from New York. For if the manifest be liable to that objection, the 16th section, which prescribes the manner in which
foreign merchandise shall be specified in the manifest, punishes the omission by a small pecuniary penalty on the master:
but does not forfeit the goods.
Neither does the clause of forfeiture in the 17th section apply to imperfections of that description. The manifest, which

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

9

The United States v. Carr et al.

the master is required by this section to deliver at the port of
destination, is the one certified by the collector at -the port of
shipment, and this he did deliver. And the law forfeits the
foreign merchandise, or distilled spirits, found on board or landed from the vessel, in those cases only in which it is not included in the manifest certified as aforesaid. This is evidently
the meaning of the law. But the record in this case shows
that the goods seized were included in the manifest; and
whether they were there described with legal precision or not
is immaterial to this inquiry. For a defect in that respect,
where there is no fraud, does not -subject the goods to forfeiture,
either at the port of shipment or the port of delivery. Indeed,
it can hardly be supposed that an offence, which in the 16th
section is punished by a small pecuniary penalty on the master,
was intended in the succeeding section of the same law to be
visited on the owner, and subject him to the aggravated punishment of the forfeiture of his goods ; and the more especially
as the defect, if any, was the fault of the public officer, who
was apprised by the oath of the master to the manifest that
foreign merchandise was on board, and whose duty it was,
when thus informed, to see that it was designated and described as the law requires before he granted the certificate and permit to proceed on the voyage.
The decree of the Court of Appeals for the Territory of
Florida must therefore be affirmed.
The other case between the same parties, now before'us, is
similar in all respects to the one in which I have just stated
the opinion of the Court. But the record shows that the value
of the goods in controversy in this case is only seventy dollars.
The act of May 31, 1844, which gives appellate jurisdiction to this court in revenue cases, without regard to the sum
in dispute, gives it only where the judgment is rendered in a
Circuit Court of the United States. Consequently, it does not
apply to a judgment rendered in the Court of Appeals for the
Territory of Florida. The right to appeal from that court is
regulated by the act of May 26, 18"24. And that act limits the
appellate power of this court to cases in which the amount in
controversy exceeds one thousand dollars.
This case must therefore be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

Where a married woman has power, under a marriage settlement, to dispose of
property settled upon her, by the execution of a power of appointment for that
purpose, and alleges afterwvards that she executed the power under undue
marital influence and through fraud practised upon her, but alleges no specific
mode or act by which this undue marital if~luence was exerted, and the facts disclosed in the testimony go very far to contradict the allegation, the charge cannot
be sustained.
Every feme covert is presumed, under such a settlement, to be, to some extent, a
free agent.
Where the marriage settlement recited that the woman was possessed of a considerable real and personal estate, which it was agreed should be settled to her sole
and separate use with power to dispose of the same by appointment or devise, and
then directed that the trustee should permit her to have, receive, take, and enjoy all
the interest, rents, and profits of the property to her own use, or to that of such persons as she might from time to time appoint during the coverture, or to such persons as she, by her last will and testament, might devise or will the same to, and
in default of such appointment or devise, then the estate and premises aforesaid
to go to those who might be entitled thereto by legal distribution, - this deed enabled her to convey the whole fee, under the power, and not merely the annual
interest, rents, and profits.
Where the marriage settlement gave her the power of appointment to the use of
such persons as she might from time to time appoint, during the coverture, by any
writing or writings under her hand and seal, attested by three credible witnesses,
and she executed a deed which recited that the parties had thereunto set their
hands and seals, and which the witnesses attested as having been seated and delivered, this was a sufficient execution of the power, although the witnesses did
not attest the fact df her signing it.
The authorities upon this point examined.
