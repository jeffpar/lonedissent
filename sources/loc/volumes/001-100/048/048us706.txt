135, and Sims v. Htindley, 6 How. 1; and as these cases show
that -the issues of fact are immaterial, though found for the defendant, the' defence will probably turn wholly on the decision
of the point raised by the demurrer.
-'The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed.
Order
This cause came on to be fieard on the transcript of the record from the. Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of.'Mississippi, and was argued by counsel. On
consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by
this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this
cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs, and that
this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to -the said Circuit Court, with directions to award a venirefacias de novo.

Tnom.As 'TowNss-,D, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V. ROBERT JEmISON.
lltho'ugh, as a,general rule, all issues, whether of law or fact, ought to be disposed
of in some way by the court below, yet; under the particular circumstances of
this case, which presented the appearance upon the record of a demurrer which
had not been disposed of, this court will presume that the demurrer, had been
withdrawn or overruled.
The thirty-second section of the. JudiciaryAct (1 Stat, atLarge, 91) forbids a reversal
of the judgment on account of the omission of the 'clerk to record such waiver
or overruling.

The statutes of jeofails examined.
Where there are special and general counts in a declaration, and @ demurrer is filed
which affects only the special counts,.and the party goes to trial upon the general
issue plea to the general counts, a verdict and judgment so obtained will not be
set asme necause the demurrer was undisposed of. A statute of Mississippi,where
the cause was triea, allows one good count to sustain a judgment.

Where the plea was bad, and the demurrer was to a replication to this bad plea, the
first fault in pleading was cominitted by the defendant, and judgment against him

was properly given.

THIS case -was brought up, by writ of error, from: the District Court ofthe United States for the Northern District of
Mississippi.
It was a suit brought by Jemison against Townsend, to recover a sum of money which Jemison had paid for him to the
Mississippi Union Bank, at Macon. The consideration appears
to have been," that Townsend should take up a note at the
CommercialBank of Columbus, for whief he, Townsend,. was
bound for one John B. Jones; but in what manner Townsend's taking up the latter note would benefit Jemison did not
appear from any part of the record.

On the 21st of May, 1842, the suit was commenced by issuing a summons, which was indorsed as follows It This action of assumpsit is brought to recover the sum of
4,000, with interest at 10 per cent., (paid for defendant,) from
27th January, 1840, to Mississippi Union Bank; defendant agreed
to pay for .plaintiff same amount in the Commercial Bank of'
Columbus, Mississippi, in consideration that plaintiff would pay
bame amount for him to the Mississippi Union Bank at Macon;
this action id brought to recover said sum of money, .defendant
having faildd to comply with his promise.

The declaration originally filed was amended, and on the 6th
of December, 1842, the amended declaation was filed, which
contained three spedial counts and the general money counts.
The first of the three special counts was as follows, the other
two being similar in substance.
"Robert Jemison, who is a citizdn of the State of Alabama,
by leaie of the court for that purpose first had and obtained,.

six -, dollars, besides interest thereon; and was. also indebted
to the Mississippi Union Bank, at its branch in Macon, in the
county of Noxubee, about the sum of three thousand dollars,
on a note of four thousand dollars, executed by the said defendant and others, payable at Jackson, at the banking-house of
the said Mississippi Union.Bank, at Jackson; and in consideration that the said plaintiff would ,take up the said last-mentioned note to the Mississippi Union Bank, and would also take

instituted an action of- assumpsit in the court below, against.Townsend,to recover the sum of three thousand and ninety dol-lars and forty-one cents, which Jemison paid-for Townsend to,

'SUPREME COURT.
Townsend v. Jemison..-

to pay the same amount for Jemison to the Commercial Bank
of Columbus, Mississippi, upon a note of one John B. Jones,
upon which Townsend was indorser for Jones. In the declaration filed at the June term of said court, 1842, there is a special count, to which is added-the usual money counts. There
is a demurrer to the special count, - 1st, because there is no
legal cause of action set out; 2d, because no legal breach is
designated; and to the money counts non assumpsit was
pleaded. The court below made no disposition of the demurrer, but gave leave to the parties to amend their pleadings
at the next term. Jemison filed an amended declaratidn, containing three special counts on the above facts, placing them
under different phases, and also adding the usual money counts;
non assumpsit was pleaded to the money counts, and to the
special counts was pleaded the statute of frauds and perjuries.
There was a- special replication to the last plea pleaded, to
which the defendant demurred, and the court below tried the
cause without making any disposition of the demurrer, and
permitted the plaintiff below to proceed to final judgment over
the demurrer. The case, being tried in Mississippi, it is believed the rule governing such cases in that State should prevail. The regularity of these proceedings being the subject of
inquiry on behalf of the plaintiff in error, we maintain,'- 1st.
That the statute of frauds and perjuries pleaded is a full and
conclusive defence to the matters alleged in the declaration.
2d. That the demurrer to the replication raised the question of
the sufficiency of the matters contained in the whole declaration in law to charge the defendant upon the agreement set out;
and it was error in the court below to have permitted the
plaintiff to proceed to final judgment while the demurrer was
pending and. undetermined. 3d.- That the defendant was entitled to his judgment in the court below, upon .his demurrer.
Let us examine, first, the three several counts contained in the
declaration. The first count is as follows, in substance: -In
consideration that defendant was liable, by note, as security for
one John B. Jones to the Commercial Bank of Columbus for
about a 9,806.50, and was indebted to the Mississippi Union
Bank about $ 3,000 on a note of $ 4,090, and in consideration
that plaintiff would take up said last note to the Union Bank,
and would also take up said Jones's in the Commercial Bank,
except an amount equal to the amount of defendant's liability
to the Union Bank, and relieve defendant from the balance of
said debt to the Commercial Bank, defendant agreed with. and
promised plaintiff to pay , on his, defendant's, liability .to the
Commercial Bank, the amount which plaintiff might take up
for him, defendant, in the Uniion Bank; and that plaintiff did

take up defendant's note in the Union Bank to the amount of

pleaded that the plaintiff's action was brought to charge him
upon a promise to pay him the debt of John B. Jones, and that
the statute of frauds and peruries -How. and Hutch. Miss.
Digest, 370, 371- barred any such action on such promise.
To this plea the plaintiff replead, and, by his replication,
denies that the count is on a promise to pay Jones's debt.
.To which the defendant demurs, and for good cause; for
the defendant's 'promise to pay so much of Jones's debt,
contained in the declaration, is clearly a promise to pay
the debt of another person, within the statute of frauds and perjuries aforesaid. The replication deies that- the count is
brought on any such promise, and thus the replication denies
the count itself, and is as good a defence as the defendant'could
have desired. What better defence could he ask-than that the
plaintiff should, by his own pleadings, deny the cause of action
set out in the count? For this reason, the demurrer was well
taken, and should have been sustained. "But again3 in support
of the demurrer, the plaintiff shows that he himself took up the
whole debt to the Commercial Bank, when the contract set out
was that he was to take up a part thereof only, and was to
leave such part as was equal to -the amount paid to the Union
Bank by plaintiff, to be paid by defendant to the Commercial
Bank. Townsend's promise was to pay that amount to the
Commercial Bank upon Jones's debt, and not to pay the plaintiff
by taking up the whole of Jones's debt to the Commercial Bank.
Plaintiff put it out of defendant's power to pay the Commercial
Bank. He relates the contract set out, and then seeks to recover damages of defendant for a breach which was brought
about by his own breach of the contract first committed.
Again, it was Jones's debt that plaintiff took up. Thus, in
direct violation of the agreement, Jones was the principal in
the note at the Commercial Bank, and, as. such, was, under the
statute of this State, first liable directly for the payment of the
note, either to the bank or the lilaintiff. Townsend being a
mere accommodation security for Jones, the bank could not
hold Townsend responsible for the money until Jones had been
pursued to insolvency; and'if the bank cannot, how can Jemison hold Townsend responsible, until he first fail to collect it
from Jones? The count shows that Townsend was a mere
indorser for Jones, and Jones being first directly liable to pay
the Commercial Bank debt, for aught that appears to the contrary
he may have paid the plaintiff the whole amount of said note.

.712

SUPREME COURT.
Townsend v. Jemison.

AS tlhe plaintiff voluntarily took that amount of. the Commercial Bank debt which,' by his contract, he was bound to have
left to be paid by the defendant, he. has placed it out of the
power of the defendant to comply; let him seek his remedy on
the note, and not bring his action to recover damages for a
bVeach'which he himself was the cause of. The demurrer was
good as to the replication and first count, and yet the plaintiff
-passed the demurrer in the court-below unnoticed, and the court
permitted him-to proceed to judgment without joinder in the.
demurrer, and- without making any disposition of it. If .the
demurrer was well taken, judgment should have been for the
defendafit; if*not, a judgment of respondeat ouster ought to
have been erftered by the action of the court; the defendant
below could not, take issue on the replication. See How.
and Hutch. Digest, 616; Revised Code of Mississippi,'120;
Walker v. Walker, -6 How. (Miss.) 500; Bright- v. -Rowland, 3 ib. 415; Davis v. Ningleton, 2 ib. a81 ; Brown v. Smith,
5 ib. 387. The second count states, that, in consideration that
thb defendant was bound to the Commercial Bank, by note, as
-security for Jones, and was also indebted to the Mississippi
Union Bank in-the sum of three thousand dollars on a note for
four thousand dollars, and in"consideration that plaintiff would
take up the note in the Union Bank, defendant promised plaintiff to pay same amount on said note in said Commercial Bank,
and plaintiff did take up said note of dbfendant in said Union
Bank, and paid the sum of three thousand and ninety 41 dollars;
-yet defendant has not yet paid the Commercial Bank on 'said.
note of John B. Jones, on which defendant is liable as aforesaid. To this the above plea was pleaded, also, that the promise declared- on *as to pay the debt of another, and that the
statute of frauds and perjuries aforesaid was a bar. And to said
plea plaintiff-also replead, and by the replication denied that the
promise declared on was a promise to pay the debt of Jones;
and thus the plaintiff denies his'own second count. And thereupon the defendant' demurs, as well he mightu The defendant could have. no better defence than the denial of the plain,tiff of his own cause ofiaction; and, upon such denial, the defencant rightfully demurred to any further answer. See the
salne authorities. Again, has plaintiff ever sustained any injury
by reason of defendant's failure to pay Jonesi debt? It is a
matter of no moment to plaintiff whether'defendant paid or
whether Jones paid, or whether Jones's debt was paid at all; he
shows no affinity between himself and Jones, or. Jones's debt,
whereby the payment would have been an advantage, or the
non-payment-a disadvantage, to plaintiff. How could the failure.
of defendant to pay a debt to Commercial Bank for which he, as

JANUARY TERM, 1849.

713

Townsend v. Jemison.
the security of Jones, owed said bank, affect. the plaintiff, who
was a stranger to said debt ? The Commercial Bank is competent to take care of its own matters; and the declaration does not show that plaintiff was guardian or trustee for
said bank, or that he was in any wise interested in the payment
of a debt due to it. If the plaintiff has taken up defendant's
note to the Union Bank, let him sue on the note, and not seek
to recover damages when he could' not possibly sustain any, by
reason of the non-payment by defendant to Commercial'Bank
of said note to Jones. The third count states that defendant,
in .consideration that he was indebted .to the Union Bank by
several nptesi and in cbnsideration that he was liable for John B.
Jones to Commercial Bank for about $ 9,806.50,-and in consideratioa that plaintiff would take up any or all of said notes in
the Union Bank, agreed.with plaintiff to pay to the' credit of
defendant's note in the Commerciar Bank, on which he was
security for Jones, whatever sum plaintiff- should pay to the
Union Bank in taking up the liabilities of said defendant in the
Union Bank; and the plaintiff has taken up defendanr'-s liabilities to the Union Bank to the amount of$ 8,000, and yet the
defendant has not paid 'the Comimercial Bank same amount of
money, but refuses to pay same. If defendant has refused
to pay the Commercial Bank, is plaintiff injured thereby? If
he has not paid, he is still bound to pay; and whatever he has
paid or has not paid, or is bound or is not bound, does not in
any wise affect the plaintiff. The Commercial Bank may have
forgiven the debt, or cancelled the notes, or Jones may have
paid it; and whether the bank forgave the debt or not, or
whether it be cancelled or not, in no wise affects the plaintiff.
If defendant had paid the Commercial Bank, as he was already
bound to do as the secuirity of Jones, Jemison would not have
been any better off; and if defendant has not paid the Commercial Bank, it is the bank's own affair whether it is ever
paid, and to Jemison it matters not whether it is ever paid.
The three counts are wholly void of*any cause of action; if
the plaintiff has paid money for defendant, let him sue for it,
but not seek to recover damages for the breach of a promise to
pay the Commercial Bank a debt which the defendant was already bound to pay by his promissory note, and to pay which a
promise to Jemison, who was a perfect stranger as to the debt
due to the Commercial Bank, creates no new obligation. As to
the other counts for money -had and advanced, money paid, laid
out, and expended, and for money had and received, they do
not sustain any action, because plaintiff hath appended thereto
no bill of particulars, except a promissory note made by defendant and others to the Union Bank. Plaintiff can give nothing in

Townsend v. Jemison.

evidence, under the common counts, except what is contained in
his bill of particulars. See Statutes of'Mississippi, How. and
Hutch. Digest, 590. And lie cannot give. his note in evidence
under said count, because it is a note given to the Union Bank
by defe ndant and others, and, by the act of the Mississippi legislature, the bank could not assign this note. See Laws of 1840,
p. 16; 3 Smedes & Marsh. 661. Here, by virtue of this law,
.emison could get no such interest in the note as to authorize
him to sue him in his own name; for, in fact, no title passed
to him in the note; the note is not negotiable nor assignable
or transferable hereby. Then the court could not permit him to
practise a fraud upon the law by waiving his action on the
note, and use' it in evidence to sustain a right of action against
the defefidant, where he holds the note itself in direct andknown violation of the statute; this note is still the property
of the Union Bank. There being no bill of partkulars ified
by plaintiff, except this note, and not being ,lawfully possessed
of it, it was not properly introduced into the bill of particulars,
and for the want of such a bill of particulars as the law requixes, the common counts in the declaration are wholly void
of any,right of action ; and it was error to admit the note under the nioney counts; the bank could not assign the note,
because it is against the law of the State. ' The Supreme Court
will reverse a judgment obtained'upon a contract entered into
in violation of the statutes of the State. See 2 Peters, 539.
Suppose Townsend had paid the note, he is bound to know the
law, that the bank could not assign his note, and could recover
the amount of the debt again of him, if he pays it to plaintiff.
See also 4 Peters, 410. We therefore contend* that the judgmeit should be reversed, and judgment rendered for Townsend
on 'his demurrer.
i
Mr. Justice WOODBURY delivered the opinion of the court.
!1'he original action 'inthis case was assumpsit.. Though the
declaration contained several counts, some on a-special promise
and -some.for Money paid and received, it was indorsed on the
original summons, that the action was "brought to recover the
sum of $ 4,000 and interest at 10 per cent., paid for defendant,
from 27th ofJanuary, 1840, to Mississippi Union Bank," &c., &c.
There was a demurrer and other pleadings as to this declaration, which it is not necessary to repeat, as leave was given to
amend throughout; and on the 6th of December, 1842, a new
aeclaration was filed, consisting of three special counts and the
usual money counts, all of which must of course be for the
original cause of action.
On the 9th of December, 1842, the defendant pleaded the

JANUARY TERM, 1849.

Townsend v. Jemison.

general issue of non assumpsit to the whole declaration; and,
for further plea to the three special counts, averred, that the suit
was brought to charge him for the debt of John B. Jones, and
for no other purpose, and that, there being no evidence of his
promise in writing, the suit was barred by the statute of frauds
and perjuries. To this the plaintiff replied, that the suit was
not so brought, but on original promises made by the defendant.
The latter filed a general demurrer to this replication.
On the 12th of 'December the general issue joined as to theL
whole declaration appears to have been tried, and a verdict returned for $ 3,451.88, for which sum, at the -same term, judgment was: rendered and execution issued.
Nothing further took place till June 5th, 1845, when this
writ of error'was brought to reverse the judgment, assigning as
the ground for it, that the demurrer to *the replication should
first have been disposed of, and that the statutd of frauds-pleaded in the preceding plea was a full defence to the matters.
alleged by the original plaintiff.
This ease presents some questions of practice and of pleading-which possess no little difficulty. They must be settled
chiefly by the reasons which may be applicable to them; and
when precedents in this court are not found for a-guide in aid
of those reasons, they may be strengthened by'analogies established in the State courts or in England, where the- systems of
pleading and practice are somewhat similar. It seems proper,
and is 'conceded, that, in a cause-where several pleas are filed,
as here, and some terminate ina demurrqr and others in an issue to the jury, they shouid all, as a general rule, unless waived
or withdrawn, be in some way disposed of by the court. The
leading inquiry, then, is, if enough appears in all the proceedings
here to render it probable that the issue, in law no less than in
fact, was in some way disposed of, though this is not, 6o. nomne,
menti6ned in the record. Assuredly, it is usual in this country,
as a matter of practice, when there is an issue of fact and another
of law in the same action, to have the question of lav heard
and decided first. Green v. Dulany, 2 lunif. 518 ; Muldrow v.
Mclelland, I Litt. 4; Co. Litt. 72. a; Com. Dig., Pleader, Demurrer, 22. The 28th rule for the Circuit Courts accords with
this, by directing tlat, in such cases, "the demurrer shall, unless
the court shall otherwise, for good cause, direct, be first argued
and determined," because a decision on that, if one way, that is,
if in favor of the demurrei, will frequently dispose of the whole
cause, and supersede the expense and necessity of a jury trial
of the other issue, as well as give an opportunity to move for an
amendment. 5 Bac. Abr., Pleasand Pleading,No. 1; Tidd's
Pract. 476; Dubery v. Paige, 2 D. & E. 394. Yet this.course

being a matter of sound discretion in the court rather than of
fixed or inflexible right, it cannot always be absolutely presumed to have been pursued. See 28th Rule, ante, and cases
before cited; 2 D. & E. 394 ; 1 Saunders, 80, note 1. But as it
is usual,'and the defendant in this case did not file any exception, as if there had been a refusal by the court to decide first
on the demurrer, the presumption does not seem so strong that
there had been a refusal or neglect to do it, as that the demurrer had been waived by the defendant, or, if not waived, had
been decided, and the particular minute of this on the record
omitted by a-mistake of the clerk. Several other circumstances
exist, which, in connection with these, contribute to strengthen this, last presumption, and to justify us on legal grounds in
inferring that one of the above events, either a waiver or decision of the demurrer, actually took place here. First, as to those
in-favor of the position that the demurrer was waived. Only
one cause of'action existed here, though set out in several
counts. This is stated, not only, as before mentioned, in the
summons by the original plaintiff, but by the defendant in his
special plea, and in the argument of his counsel. The general
issue, which was joined and tried, went to the whole declaration; and under that, at the trial, any parol evidence offered
in its suppbrt could have been objected to as within the statute of
frauds, which seems to have been the whole defence, as well
as under the special plea setting up this statute against the special counts. This is clear from the books of practice. 1 Chit'
P1. 515; 2 Leigh's N. P. 1066; 1 T'idd's Pract. 646. Though,
to be sure; it could be pleaded specially,'also, and 'this may now
be necessary under the new rules of court in England. 1 Bingh.
N. C.781 ; 2 Crompt., Mees., & Rosc. 627. Hence, from abundant caution lest this objection might not be admissible under
the general, issue, the special plea here was probably at first
filed. -But before the trial came on, which was three days after,
it is likely that the defendant had become convinced that it was
admissible, under- the general issue, and therefore went to
trial without having the demurrer first argued and decided, or
even joined, but waived it. If, on the contrary, he concluded to try the issue to the jury first, and then, if not allowed.
there to make his objection as to the 'statute, to argue the demurrer afterwards, the inference would be equally strong, that
he was allowed to urge the bbjection at the trial, and had a decision on it there, and therefore waived his special plea and
demurrer, and a separate and unnecessary decision on them,
afterwards. Such was the presumption in the case.of Bond v.
Hills, 3 Stewarc (Alabama), 283, more fully explained hereafter. It was held likewise in Morrison v. Morrison, 3 Stewart,

JANUARY TERMi 1849.

'717

Townsend v. Jemison.

444, that if a demurrer ana an issue of fact were to the same
matter, and the latter was tried first, it must be presumed that
the other had been waived.
. In Dufan v. Couprey's Heirs, 6 Peters, 170, a writ of error was
brought, for the same general cause as here, that one of the
pleas intended for the court did .not appear by the record to.
have been decided. But the court sustained the judgment below;
the other plea, on examination, as will soon be shown to be
the case heie, being found immaterial after the finding of the
jury. . Where one material -issue is decided going to the whole
declaration, it is of no consequence how an immaierial issue
going only to a part of it is found, if no injury be'done by it
to either party.. 6 Missouri, 544. And by parity of reasoning, it would be of no consequence whether it was decided at
all or not, if enough else is decided to lispose properly of the
whole case.
What fortifies these views is the fact, that the defendant
never procured a joinder to his demurrer by the plaintiff. As
he interposed ,this defence in a special plea, and filed the demurrer to the replication, it would be material for him, if wanting a decision on them, to get the pleadings finished.. He
should have moved for a joinder, or got a rule for one, (1 Chit.
P1. 628,) and should likewise have" moVed for a decision on
them, if desired,. before a final judgment was rendered on the
verdict. It is true that some books appear t o consider it the
duty of the plaintiff to join in a demurrer soon, after it has
been tendered by the defendant. But this, it.is believed, generally depends on a positive rule of court, which may exist, to
require it. 33d Rule of Practice for Courts of Equity, 1 How.
43; Williams's case, Skinner, 217. And without such rule, as
in this case, h may need ahd take time to decide on making a
motion .to amend, before joining; and the harshest penalty
proper for delay in the joinder would seem to be, that- the d
murrer may be considered, When requested by the party making
it, though no formal joinder has taken place. 3 Levinz, 222;
Skinner, 217. The omi'sion. of the defendant, then, to obtain
a joinder, to which he was by law entitled, (I Chit. 647;
Barnes, 163,) the omission to add one himself, which is sometimes
permissible, (5 Taunt: 164, and 1 Pike (Ark:), 180,) and the
omission to request a decision without any joinder, as he may
after much delay, (Skinner, 217,) all appear on the record, and
look not only like a waiver of a decision on the demurrer by
the defendant, but a neglect of his own duties on the subject.
-A waiver of a demurrer often takes place, and is, by law, permissible. 1 Tidd's Pr. 710;' 1 East, 135; 2 Bibb, 12; 1 Burrow, 321 ; 2 Strange, 1181. Quilibet renuntiare potest jure

Townsend v. Jemison.

.pro se introducto. The want of a decision would, in this as
pect of the subject, seem to be by his own consent; and consensus tollit errorem. The course of the defendant appears to
have been, practically and substantially, if'not formally, an*
abandonment of a wish for any-separate decision on the, demurrer. See cases of this kind. Wright et al. v. Hollingsworthi
1 Peters, 165; Bac. Abr., Error,K. 5; Vaiden v. Bell, 3 Randolph, 448; Patrick v. Conrad, 3 Marsh. 613; 2 Marsh. 227;
Casky v. January, Hardin, 539. As a plea of the general issue,
while ; demurrer is pending undisposed of, is considered a
waiver of it. Cobb v. Ingalls, Breese, 180.
'In another view of'the subject, looking to the defendant's
own neglect as the cause, a party cannot be allowed to take
advantage of his own wrong or inattention. Thus it has,been
decided, that a writ of error will not lie for one's own neglect
or irregularity. 1 McCord, 205; 1 Pike (Ark.), 90; Kincaid
"v. Higgins, 1 Bibb, 396; 2 Blackf. 71; 3 McCbrd, 302, 477;
Kyle v. Hayle, 6 Missouri, 544. It strengthens these conclusions, that the original defendant seems to have long, acquiescedd
in what he now excepts to, - that he does not appear to have
asked for a decision on the demurrer, to have made any complaint at the time of the demurrer not being decided, to have
filed any motion about it, offered any bill of exceptions, or
even brought any writ of error, till after the lapse of "nearly
three years. So much as to the waiver of the demurrer. But
if the demurrer was not3 in truth, waived or withdrawn by the
defendant, or cannot be now so considered, from all which appears on the record, the presumption from all is evident, that
the demurrer and special plea were actually decided on by the
court, and the omission to enter it on the record may be cured
by the statute of jeofails. " Such a decision would have been
its ordinary and pioper course of proceeding. ,
This court has held, in a state of4 things much like this, as
will soon be more fully explained, that it was bound to presume
that "justice was administered in the ordinary form."' - 4 How.
167. And hence, in 3 Stewart, (Alabama,) 447, 448, where
a decree was averred in the record, but not its form, it was
presumed to have been in the ordinary form. The court could
not properly have decided and given judgment for the plaintiff
in this case, as it did, and, as must be presumed, properly, in the
first instance, if the demurrer had not been waived or settled
in favor of the plaintiff. Nor was the defendant likely to have
acquiesced in the judgment without putting an exception on
the recotd, unless one of these circumstances had occurred.
This question has arisen'in several of the States, and been decided in conformity with these views. In the case of Cochran's

JANUARY TERM, 1.849.

719.

Townsend v. Jemison.

Fxecutors v. Davis, 5 Litt. 129, the court very properly, adopt
a like.principle, saying, - " To this plea ther- was a demurrer,
and although there is no order of record expressly disposing of
the demurrer, yet; as the court gave judgment for the plaintiff
on the whole record, it must be taken that the demurrer was
sustained and the plea overruled." So in substance it was held
in McCollom v. Hogan, 1 Alabama. 515; and in Bond v. Hills,
3 Stewart, 283, where, as in this case, there was a plea, amounting to the general issue, or containing what was admissible under
it, and it did not appear distinctly to have been.disposed of,but
the general issue was tried, it was held to be presumed that the
defendant had -the full benefit, of the objection on the trial, and.'
error will not lie. It is true that where one issue in a cause is
found one way and another on a matter entirely distinct is not
disposed of, it may not be proper always'to consider it as decided. Pratt v. Payne, 5 Missouri, 51. But here the questions
involved in both issues were the same ; both related to the
same cause of action, and both to the same defence. The
cases on this subject are so much more numerous in the States
than in England or in this court, that we oftener find it necessary
to resort to thein for analogies in- support.of our reasoning as to
what should, under all the facts', be presumed. But in this
court, at this very term, we have a strong illustration of the
correctness or truth of such a presumption, in the case of Harris v. Wall; where, on similar findings by a jury on some pleas
and a demurrer to others, and a judgment for the defendant
without any. entry made specifically that the 'demurrer was
disposed of, it happens, in point of fact, that it was decided,
and the judge on that circuit, now present, has with him his
written opinion, which he delivered when deciding it. So in
Stockton et al. v. Bishop, 4 Howard, 167, in a writ of error,
where a verdict appeared and a judgment, but not for. any par-*
ticular sum, with several other important omissions, this court,
by Catron, Justice, remarked, -" Still we are bound to presume,
in favor of proceedings in a court having jurisdiction of the
parties and subject-matter, that justice was administered ini the
ordinary form when so much appears as is found in this imperfect record."
Again, on a writ of error, many things will always be presumed or intended, in law as well as fact, to have happened,
which are not iysissimis verbis or substantively so set but on
the record, but are plainly to be inferred to have happened from
what is set out. Cro. Eliz. 467; 4 Howard, 166. Thus, in
this case, 'numerous circumstances stated-on the-record, and already referred to, indicate that the demtr-rer and special plea, if
not withdrawn or waived, were actually disposed of. Among

SUPREME "COURt.

-them, raising a strofig presumption that way, is the fact, that
three days elapsed after the pleas and demurrer were -filed, before the trial 'f the other issue; that within this period the
court haa time to hear the question of law argued; that it is
the usual practice to hear such a question before going to a trial
of the facts; and hence, unless the demurrer was waived, that !he
court, before the trial, did probably hear and decide the demurrer against the defendant. Again, the court would have been
still less likely to have proceeded to final judgment without
first disposing of the question of law, unless waived- or settled
either before, at, or after the trial. Such, too, being the duty
of 'the court, they are to be presumed, till the contrary appears,
to have done their duty. Wilkes v. Dinsmain, ante, 89. Nor
is such a presumption here, as some have suggested, against the
record; because the record says nothing on the subject. But
it is consistent -withevery thing that is there said, and with what
ii fairly to be infeired from the whole record, carrying witk us
the probable .idea, in that event, of some omission or misprision by the clerk in noting all which happened.
The omission of the clerk to.enter onthe record the judgment upon the demurrer, or to- state its waiver, if it was abandoned, would be merely a clerical mistake,; and it is well settled
at common law, that a misprision by a clerk, if the case be
clearly that'alone, though it consist of the omission of an, important word or expression, is not a good ground to reverse a
judgment, where substance enough appears to show that all
which was proper and required was properly done. Willoughby v. Gray, Cro. Eliz. 467; Weston's case, 11 Mass. 417.
The statutes of jeofails usually go still further in remedying
defects after verdicts and judgments. Considering this, under
those statutes, as a case of defect or.waht of form in the entry
*by the clerk, anid not of error in the real doings of the court,
the statute of jeofails of the United States, curing all defects
or want of form in judgments, is explicit against our reversing
this for such a cause. Sec. 32 of Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat.
at Large, 91. If the State laws are to go.verr, the words of
the statute of jeofails are equally explicit and more minute in
Mississippi, in curing such defects, resembling more the English
statutes. Uutchinson's.Code for Mississippi, 841. It is.not a
little singular, that the unwillingness in England t6 have judgments disturbed by writs of error for defects in them or'in the
prior pleadings, where a verdict of a jury has been rendered
for a plaintiff, is such, that something like five or six acts of
Parliament were passed bef6re our ancestors emigrated hither,
* and -several more since, to prevent writs of error from being
maintained for defects in form, as wiell as to empower amend-

'ments in such cases. See those in 1 Bac. Abr., Amendment
and Jeofails; O'Driscoll v. McBurney, 2 Nott & McCord, 58.
Some of the defects cured seem to be very near as strong as
the present case. 11 Coke, 6. b; Act of 32 Hen. VIII. c. 30.
The difficulty is in deciding "what is substance and what is
form," and that is governed by no fixed test, but it is laid down
that it "must be determined in every action according to its
1 Bac. Abr., Amendment and Jeofails, E. 1; 1
nature."
Saund. 81, note 1.
At common law, defects in collateral pleadings. or other matters not preceding the verdict, and not to be proved in order to
get a verdict, were not cured by it. Yet those were cured which
ielated to matters necessary to be shown to get a verdict, aid
hence, after it, are presumed to have been shown. Renner v.
Bank of Columbia, 9 Wheat. 581; Com. Dig., Pleader, Count,
c. 87; Carson v. Hood, 4 Dall. 108 ; 1 Sumn. 314; 1 Gall. 261 ;
1 Wils. 222; Burr. 17, 25; Cotterel v. Cummins et'al., 6 Serg.
& Rawle, 348; 1 Sumner, 319; 16 Conn. 586; 11 Wendell,
375; 7 Greenleaf, 63. But these aefects in collateral maters, as here, when they relate to form, are as fully cured by
the statutes of jeofails as those connected with the verdict are
by intendment at common law. Stennel v. Hogg, 1 Saunders, 228, note 1; Dale v. Dean, 16 -Conn. 579. Any omissibn
like this would certainly be amendable below, and some cases
have gone so far as to hold, in error, that any defect amendable
below will be considered as actually amended. Cummings v..
Lebo, 2 Rawle, 23.
In conclusion on this point, this court, by Catron, Justice, in
the writ of error before named, of Stockton et al. v. Bishop (4
How. 164), stated, that "it must be admitted that Congress
acted wisely in declaring that no litigant party shall lose his
right in law for want of form; and in going one step further,
as Congress unquestionably has done, by. declaring that, to pave
.the parties' rights, the substance should be infringed on to some
extent, when contrasted with modes of proceeding in the English courts, and with their ideas (.f what is substance."
After this, it would seem hypercritical, and contrary to the
whole spirit of the statutes of jeofails both of the United States
.and of Mississippi, to allow an exception so contrary to legal presumption ds this to be sustained. Nor does it promote the.
ends of jtustice to let parties lie by and not take excepiions, and'
afterwards reverse judgments for omissions, which, if noticed at
the time, would have been corrected. McCready v. James, 6Wharton, 547. And this court, where the issues were three,
and the-verdict and judgment not separate on each, but general'
on all, and the objection was taken on the writ of error, in

SUPREME COURT.
Townsend v. Jemison.

RoachP v. Hulings, 16 Peters, 321, said, by Daniel; Justice,"Objections of this dharacteri .that are neither taken at the
usual stage of the proceedings nor prominently presented on
the face of the record, but which may be sprung upon a party
after an apparent waiver of them by an adversary, and still
more after a trial upon the merits, * can have no claim to the
favor of the court, but should be entertained- only in obedience
to the strictest requirements of law" ; and they were in that
case accordingly overruled or considered as cured.
Another ground for affirming the judgment, which the
plaintiff in error cannot easily overcome, is, that if the three
counts to which the special plea is filed cannot be sustained,
the defendant in error has obtained a verdict on all the counts;
thus showing, at least, that there was no valid defence to the
others. And if those three were conceded to be bad, the othets
are good, and, notwithstaniding a verdict and judgment on all,
the" latter must not in such case be reversed on error. By an
express statute in Mississippi, passed June 28th, .1842, one
good count, though others are bad, will sustain a judgment.
Hutch. Code for Miss., ch. 5, art. 1. This is not a peculiarity
confined to Mississippi, but a like rule prevails in several other
States. 2 Bibb, 62; 2 Litt. 100; 2 Bay, 204; 2 Hill, 648;
1 Blackf. 12; 1 Stewart, 384; 2 Connect. 324. And though
in some it is otherwise'(1 Caines, 347; 11 Johns. 98; 9 Mass.
198), and is otherwise in England (Grant v. Astle, Doug. 703),
yet it has been regretted by some of her eminent jurists as "inconvenient and ill-judged."
'If this provision, then,'in Mississippi, sh6uld be regarded as
a rile of practice, it existed there when the last process act, of
May, 1828, passed, and hence, by acts of Congress and. the
rules of our Circuit Courts, binds them; but if it be a right
conferged by her statute, it equally must govern us, by the Judiciary law of 1789, in all cases .tried like this in that State.
16 Peters, 89, 303.
But, beside these reasonings and views, to some of which a
portion of the court except, there exists another ground for affirming the judgment below, which appears to us fully established both on principle and adjudged eases. The first fault in
the pleadings connected with the demurrer seems to have been
committed by the defendant himself, and no reason appears on
' the whole record why the original judgment should not have
been rendered against him on that ground. His only defence
set up .was the statute of frauds and-perjuries. This statute was
pleaded.specially; but, on the facts and the law, it does not seem
to have been applicable -to the case. The case was a transaction of money paid by the plaintiff on account of the defend-

JANUARY TERM, 1849.

723

Townsend v. Jemison.

ant, and must have been .considered by the court and jury as
done under an original undertaking to repay it in. a particular
way, which the defendant had not fulfilled, and which was not
within the provisions of the statute. The defendant was misled, by the mode of payment being special and to a third person,
into an impression that the original promise was to a third person. The suit is not brought by the third person, to whom the
original plaintiff owed a debt, nor was the promise made to a
third person; but it is brought by the person who advanced
money on account of the defendant, on a consideration moving
from him alone, and on the promise made to him alone for its
payment in a particular manner. Bee, on this, Read v. Nash, 1
Wilson, 305; 2 Leigh's N. P. 1031; King v. Despard, '5
-Wendell, 277; Towne v. Grover, 9 Pick. 306; Hodgson v.
.Anderson, 3 Barn. & Cres. 842.
This was virtually, therefore, an undertaking by the defendant to pay his -own debt, but simply specifying a particular
manner of doing it; and unless it was found at the trial that
the statute of fra!.ds did not apply, it is to be presumed that a
recovery would not have been had before the, jury, where it
was competent to make this an objection.
The matter of the plea, then, having been clearly bad, it appears to be well settled, that, when a demurrer is filed to a replication, if the plea is bad, judgment.ought to be given for the
plaintiff. Anon., 2 Wilson, 150; Semble, Moor, 692; Com.
Dig., Pleader, Proceedings in Error,3 B. 16; 1 Levinz, 181.
The whole record connected with the demurrer is open on the
writ of error, and judgment goes against the earlidst fault.
Breese, 207; Morgan v. Morgan, 4 Gill &'Johns. 395.
In regard to-the suggestion, that the demurrer might have
applied to some other objection than the statute of frauds,
either in the plea, or, going back to the declaration, some defect
there (as the first defect bad on general demurrer is the fatal
one, 1 Chit. P1. 647), it is enough to say that no other appears,
then or now, to have been pointed out, and none is intimated
in the argument for the plaintiff in error.
If is very doubtful, also, if, in this particular case, a defect in
the declaration would be considered at all on this demurrer, as
the general i~sue is pleaded to all of the declaration-covering
these three special counts. And an issue in fact and a demurrer cannot both be allowed to reach the same count.. Bac.
Abr., Pleas.andPleading,n. 1; 2 Blackf. 34; 5 Wendell, 104.
If there be an exception to this rule, it must be by some local
law or practice not, existing here. 1 Litt. 4; 4 Munford, 104.
From the whole record, therefore, it appears that the judgment belowin favor of the plaintiff was probably correct, even

if the demurrer had not been waived, and in this 'event it is
clear that the judgment should not, on this writ of error, be reversed. Hobart, 56; Corn. Dig., Pleader,Demurrer, Q. 2;
Saunders v. Johnson, 1 Bibb, 322; 6 Monroe, 295, 606; Phelps
v. Taylor, 4 Monroe, 170; Smble, 3 Bibb, 225; McWaters v.
Draper, 5 Monroe, 496; Hardin, 164. In Foster v. Jackson, Hobart, 56, the opinion says, -" It is the office of the court to judge
the law upon the whole record." The other cases cited show,
that in writs of error, as well as demurrers, the same rule prevails.
The propriety of our conclusions in this case becomes more
manifest when we consider that a reversal of the judgment
would be of no use to the original defendant; because, if reversed, the order here could not be to render judgment for the
defendant, but to have a record made of the waiver or decision.
of the demurrer, if either occurred, and if not, then a joinder in
demurrer and an opinion below on the question.presented by it,
and which opinion, as already shown, must probably be for the
pl.intiff, and then the same judgment be entered again on the
verdict which exists now. McGriffin v. Helson, 5 Litt. 48;
2 Strange, 972; Jackson v. Runlet, 1 Woodb. & Min. 381.
Finally, so far as any presumptions or doubts on any of these
considerations should operate against either party in forming our
conclusions, we are unable to see any thing in the acquiescent
conduct of the original defendant before the judgment, or in the
merits of his original defence, or in his writ of err(,r, brought
after such an uninterrupted silence and assent for years, which
entitle him to any peculiar favor.
The plaintiff in error, likewise, must always make out his
case clearly and satisfactorily, as every reasonable intendment
should be in favor of a judgment already rendered. Fentriss
v. Smith, 10 Peters, 161;' Lander v. Reynolds, 3 Litt.. 16;
Lou. Code of Pract. 909, note, and cases there cited; 3 Martin
(N. S.), 29 ;.15 Louis. 480, &c. This not having been done in
the present case, we think that the judgment below must be
affirmed.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY.
I think the judgment of the District Court may be supported,
on the ground that the decision .n the demurrer had become
immaterial after the verdi~t on the general issue. The special
plea out of which the demurrer arose appilied only to three,
counts. There was a fourth count, to which no defence was
made except by the plea of the general issue; and according to
the law and practice of Mississippi, one good count is sufficient
to support the judgment when there are several counts in a declaration, and the othersbad.
And after the verdict on the

JANUARY TERM, 1849.

725

Townsend v. Jemison.

general issue, the decision of the demurrer was immaterial, and
the judgment must still have been for the plaintiff even if the
demurrer was decided for defendant. The omission to dispose
of an immaterial issue is not a ground for reveising a judgment,
as the decision of such issue could not influence the judgment
of the District Court. But I do not concur in the other portions of the opinion, and think that many of the positions taken
in it cannot be supported.
Mr. Justice CATRON concurs with the Chief Justice.
Mr. Justice DANIEL.
Regarding the opinion just delivered as in direct opposition
to the very canons of pleading at law, I feel constrained to declare my dissent from it. I cannot subscribe to, and can
hardly comprehend, 6 doctrine of presumptions, which, in proceedings at law and on questions of pleading, infers that the
parties or the court have acted in direct contravention of the
facts apparent upon, and standing prominently out upon, the record, operating by such presumption a false feature of the record
itself. In ihis case the defendant .has tendered an issue in law
to the replication to the third plea; the record discloses the
fact, that this issue has never been tried; it is therefore undeniable that there is a chasm in the proceedings, and that the
court has not passed upon the whole dase. If presumption can
be admitted to warrant the conclusion that this demurrer was
withdrawn, where shall such presumption end? Would it not
be equally, regular to presume that -any other plea or issue on
the record had been withdrawn? Then, if any other source
than the record itself can be resorted to in order to ascertain
what was in truth involved in the tral, conjecture or evidence
aliunde must be introduced to atetenine; and that which, by
legal intendment, is the only evidence or proof of the proceedings, the record, becomes the weakest of all probf, or rather
becomes no proof at all. I think the judgment should be reversed, and the cause remanded for a trial on all the issues of
law and of fact.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the District Court of the United States for the.
Northern District of Mississippi, and was argued by counsel.
On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged
by this court, that the judgment of the said District Court in
this cause be' and the same is hereby, affirmed, with cbsts, and
damages at the rate of six per cent. per annum.
