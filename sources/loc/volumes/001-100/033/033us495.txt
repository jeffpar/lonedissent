Insurance. In a policy of insurance there was a memorandtfin stipulating,
that "the assurers shall not be liable for any charge, damage or loss which
may arise in consequence of seizure or detention for or on account of illicit
trade, or trade in articles contraband of war." This provision is not to be
construed, that there must be a legal or justifiable cause of condemnation,
but that there must be such a cause for seizure or detention.
It is not every seizure or detention which is excepted, but such only as is
made for and on account of a particular trade. A seizure or detention,
which is a mere act-of lawless violation, wholly unconnected with any supposed illicit or contraband trade, is not within the terms or spirit of the
exception. And as little is a seizure or detention, not bona fide made upon
a just suspicion of illicit or contraband trade, but the latter used as a mere
pretext or colour for an act of lawless violence : for, under such circumstances, it can in no just sense be said to be made for or on account of
such trade. It is a mere fraud to cover a wafiton trespass; a pretence, and
not a cause for the tort. To bring a case then within the exception, the
seizure or detention must be bona fide, and upon a reasonable ground. If
there has not been an actual illicit or contraband trade, there must at least
be a well founded suspicion of it-a
probable cause to impute guilt, and
justify further proceedings and inquiries; and this is what the law deems
a legal and justifiable cause for the seizure or detention.
The ship insured, when seized, had not unloaded all her outward cargo, but
was still in the progress of the outward voyage originally designated by the
owners; she sailed on that voyage from ProvidAnce, R. I., with contraband
articles on board, belonging, With the other parts of the cargo, to the owners
of the ship, with a false destination and false papers, which yet accompanied the vessel; the contraband articles had been landed, before the policy,
which was a policy on time designating no particular voyage, had attached;
the underwriters, though taking no risks within the exception, were not
ignorant of the nature and objects of the voyage ; and the alleged cause of
the seizure and detention was the trade in articles contraband of war, by the
landing of the powder and muskets, which formed a part of the outward
cargo. By the principles of the law of nations there existed, under these
circumstances, a right to seize and detain the ship and her remaining cargo,
and to subject them to adjudication for a supposed forfeiture, notwithstand.
ing the prior deposit of the contraband goods: there was a legal and justifiable cause of seizure.
According to the modern law of nations, for there has been some relaxation
in practice from the strictness of the ancient rules, the carriage of contraband goods to the enemy, subjects them, if captured in delicto, to the
penalty of confiscation; but-the vessel and the remaining cargo, if they
do not belong to the owner of the contraband goods, are not subject to the
same penalty. The penalty is applied to the latter only, when there has

406 '

4SUPREME COURT.

[Carripgton ;nd others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]
been some actsial co-operation on their part, in a meditated fraud upon the
belligeren
by covering up the voyage under false papers and with a false
destinatikn. This is the general doctrine when the captureis made intransitu,
while the contraband goods are yet on board. But when the contraband
goods havi been deposited at the port of destination, and the subsequent
voyage has thus been disconnected with the noxious articles, it has not
been usual to apply the penalty to the ship or cargo upon the return voyage,
altiough the latter may be the proceeds of the contraband. And the same
rule would seem, by analogy, to apply to cases where the contraband arti/ales have been deposited at in intermediate port on the outward voyage,
and before it had terminated ; although there is not any authority directly
in point. But in the highest prize courts of England, while the distinction
between the outward and homeward voyage is admitted to govern, yet it is
established that it exists only in favour of neutrals who conduct themselves
with fairness and good faith in the arrangement of the voyage. If, with a
view to practise a fraud upon the belligerent, and to escape from his acknowledged right of capture and detention, the voyage is disguised, and
the vessel sails under' false papers and with a false destination, the mere
deposit of the contraband in the course of the voyage, is not allowed to
purge away the guilt of the fraudulent conduct of the neutral.
Nothing is better settled both in England and America, than the doctrine
that a non commissioned cruiser may seize for the benefit of the government;
and if his acts are adopted by the government, the, property, when condemned, becomes a droit of the government.
When there has been a bona fide seizure and detention for and on account of
illicit or contraband trade, and by a clause in the policy of insurance it was
agreed that " the assurers should ndt be liable for any charge, damage or
loss, which may arise in consequence of seizure or detention for or on account of illicit trade or trade in articles contraband of war," a sentence of
condemnation or acquittal, or other regular proceeding to adjudication, is
not necessary to discharge the underwriters. If the seizure or detention
be lawfully made for or on account of illicit or contraband trade, all charges,
damages and losses consequent thereon, are within the scope of the exception. They are properly attributable to such seizure and detention as the
primary cause, and relate back thereto. If the underwriters be discharged
from the primary hostile act, they are discharged from the consequences
of it.

ON a certificate of division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts.
The case, as stated in the opinion of the court, was as follows.
On the 1st of October 1824, the defendants, the Merchants'
Insurance Company, underwrote A policy of insurance for the
plaintiffs, Carrington and others, for ten thousand dollars, on
property on board. the ship General Carrington, at and from
the port of Coquimbo in Chili, to any port or ports, place or
places, one or more times, for and during the term of twelve
calendar months, commencing on the 5th day of June 1824

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' insurance Company.]

at noon, and ending on the 5th day of June 1825 at noon.
The policy is against the usual perils, and contains the following clause. "It is also agreed that the assurers shall not be
answerable for, any charge, damage or loss which may arise
.inconsequence of seizure or detention, for or on account of
illicit or prohibited trade, or tradein articles contraband of war.
But the judgment of a foreign consular or colonial court shall
not be conclusive upon the parties as to the fact of there having been articles contraband of war on board; or as to the fact
of an attempt to trade in violation of the law of nations."
The ship sailed from Providence, Rhode Island, on the 21st
of December 1823, cleared for the Sandwich Islands and Canton, but was immediately bound to Valparaiso in Chili, with
such ulterior destination as was stated in her orders; the clearance being a usual and iustomary mode of clearance -at that
time fol vessels bound to Chili and Peru,. A part of the cargo
consisted of eighteen cases of muskets and bayonets, each case
containing twenty; and three hundred kegs or quarter kegs of
cannon powder, containing about twenty-five pounds each;
and these, together with the residue of the cargo, belonged to
the owne's of the ship. At the commencement of the voyage,
and until the final loss of the ship, open hostilities existed between Spain and the new governments or states of Chili and
Peru. From the orders, it was apparent that the object of the
voyage was to sell the cargo in Chili and Peru. The ship was
to proce-d direct for Valparaiso, and was to enter that port
under the plea of a want; of water. Some part of the cargo
was expected to be sold at that port ; and thence the ship was
to proceed along the coast of Chili and Peru for the purposes
of trade. There is no allegation that the underwriters were
not well acquainted with the nature and objects of the voyage.
The ship-arrived at Valparaiso on the 17th of April 1824.
At the time of her arrival, and until the lossi as hereinafter
stated, the Spanish royal authorities were in possession of a
portion of upper Peru, including Quilca, and Moliendo, and of
the port of Callao in lower Peru. The rest of Peru, and the
whole of Chili, were in possession of the Peruvian and Chilian
new governments. In the harbour of Valparaiso sixteen casks
of the powder were, with the knowledge of the government,
vOL. vit.-3 r

SUPREME COURT.
(Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

sent on board of an English brig then in the harbour; and, as
the plaintiffs allege, sold to the master of the brig: and all the
muskets except ten, alleged to be kept for the ship's use, were
landed in Valparaiso with the knowledge of the government.
The ship, with the remainder of her cargo on board, sailed
for Valparaiso, early in May following; arrived at Coquimbo,
in Chili, on the 13th day of the same month. There the
remainder of the powder, except nine casks, more or less damaged, alleged to be retained for the ship's use, was landed in
the course of the same month, with the knowledge of the
government. The ship sailed from Coquimbo for Huasco, in
Chili, on or about the 5th day of June following, and arrived
at Huasco in the same month; having sold at the. previous
port, a part of her outward cargo by permission of the government, as the plaintiffs allege, and taken in merchandise belonging to the plaintiffs, and other citizens of the United States, to
be delivered at some ports on the coast. The ship arrived at
Quilca, with the greater part of her outward cargo still on
board, on the 20th of June, and there sold, with the knowledge
of the government, as the plaintiffs allege, a considerable portion of her outward cargo; and delivered some of the articles
taken in at the previous ports. While lying at anchor in the
roadstead of Quilca, and before she had completed the discharge of her outward cargo, she was seized by an armed
vessel called the Constante, commanded by one Jose Martinez,
sailing under the royal flag, and acting, as the defendants
allege-, by the royal authority of Spain; but alleged by the
plaintiffs to be fitted out and commissioned at Callao, by Jose
Ramon Rodil, the highest military commander of the castle
of Callao, holding his commission subordinate to La Serna, the
viceroy of Peru, under the king of Spain; there being, as the
defendants allege, no regular civil government in the place;
the castle of Callao being then, and until the final loss of the
ship, besieged by sea and land. The ship was carried from
Quilea to Callao, where certain proceedings were had against
her and her cargo on board, by the orders of general Rodil ; and
they were never restored, but were totally lost to the plaintiffs.
The alleged cause of the seizure and detention, was the trade
in articles contraband of war, by the landing of the powder
and muskets in Chili, as aforesaid.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[darrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company,]

Upon the trial of the cause upon the evidence, the following
questions occurred, upon which the opinions of the judges were
opposed ; and, thereupon, it was ordered by the court, on motion of the counsel for the plaintiffs, that the points on which
the disagreement happened, should be certified to the supreme
court of the United States, for their decision, viz.
1. Whether a seizure and detention, to come within the.
exception of the policy relating to contraband and illicit trade,
must be for a legal and justifiable cause.
2. Whether, assuming the other facts to Uheas' stated and
alleged, and taking the authority of the seizing vessel to be
such as the plaintiffs allege, there was a legal and justifiable cause for the seizure and detention of the General Carrington and her cargo.
3. Whether, assuming the other facts to be as stated and
alleged, and taking the authority of the seizing vessel to be
such as the defendants allege, there was a legal and justifiable cause for the seizure and detention of the General Carrington and her cargo.
4. Whether a general in the military service of Spain, subordinate to La Serna, viceroy of Peru, under the king of Spain,
but having the actual and exclusive command of Callao, and
no civil authority existing therein, and cut off by the forces of
the enemy by sea and land from all communication with any
superior civil or military officer, could lawfully seize and detain
neutral property for contraband trade, if just cause existed for
a condemnation thereof.
5. Whether such officer, so situated, has a right to appoint
and constitute a court, of which he himself is one, for the trial
and condemnation of such property.
6. Whether, supposing the ship to have traded in articles
contraband of war in the ports of Chili, and to have been seized
afterwards in a port of Peru, then under the royal authority,
before she had discharged her outward cargo, for and on account of such contraband trade, the underwriters be not discharged, whether the subsequent proceedings for her adjudication were regular or irregular.
The case was argued by Mr Binney and Mr Sergeant, for

SUPREME COURT.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

the plaintiffs; and by Mr Franklin Dexter and Mr Webster,
for the defendants.
MrBinney, for the plaintiffs, contended, upon the first pointwhether a seizure and detention, to come within the exception
of the policy relating to contraband and illicit trade, must be
for a legal and justifiable cause; that the seizure must be for
a legal and justifiable cause, in order to take it out of the policy;' an asserted cause is not enough.
This is evident from the words of the policy, from the context and circumstances of the insurance, from the reason and
spirit of the agreement of the parties, from the mischief of the
old law ; and from the consequences of a contrary doctrine.
The words of the policy designate an actual, not a supposed
trade in contraband goods. There cannot be a seizure for
cause of contraband, unless there ha3 been actually such a
trade; There could not be a seizure for or on account of such a
trade, without there having been such a trading. If the fact
of the trade does not exist, it is a mere allegation, suspicion, or
pretence of trade, when there is none in reality. Had such
been the intention of the parties the words would have conformed to it.,
Both the fact and the illegality must concur, or there is no
trade in contraband. This is implied in the term contraband.
In legal understanding gunpowder and muskets are not contraband; they may be innocently transported by a neutral;
although under particular circumstances their transportation
may be illegal and a breach of neutrality, and they become
contraband. There is no trade in contraband, except what
the law declares 'such; nor can there be a seizure for contraband,
when the fact and the law do not concur to prove contraband.
The plain natural meaning of the words of the policy is, 1.
That there mustbe a seizure. 2. That there must be a trade
in contraband in fact, 3. That it must have been so in law,.
to justify a seizure.
2. The .context is conclusive to show, that the fact of a con
traband trade, instead of pretence or allegation, .was intended
by the parties; and this is conformable to the law, The language used is intended to exclude the conclusion of a material
fact, resulting from the iudgment of a foreign-court ; and this

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' InsUrance Company.]

shows the materiality of that question of fact. Both parties
agreed that the fact was material, and provision is made to
guard against the operation of a foreign judgment; and to leave
-that question open to the parties, if it should become material.
3. The reason and spirft of the whole contract confirm this
The intcntion of the. assured was to secure
construction.
In the policy there
themselves against unlawful violence.
were many exceptions in which the assured took upon themselves the risk of loss. An exception against unlawful violence,
is contrary to the whole spirit of the instrument. An exception against lawful violence is not so, but is consistent with its
general tenor.
4. The mischief of the contract to th&underwriters, before
the clause was introduced into policies, sustains the construction.
The clause, it is believed, is of Pennsylvania origin, having
been introduced into policies of insurance in Philadelphia in
1788. In Boston it was introduced in 1823. Its history is
given by chief justice Tilghman, in Smith v. The Delaware
Insurance Company, 3 Serg. and Rawle 82. He says, that
the assured contended, that unless the foreign revenue laws
were known to them, the underwriters were not answerable
for a loss by their violation. Perhaps it would have been
more accurate to say that they contended, that if the underwriters knew, or were bound to know that the trade insured
was prohibited, they were liable for the loss,
This was so held in 1780, in Lever v. Fletcher, 1 Marsh.
617, and it is now the doctrine of insurance as held by various
authorities. Phillips 276; 1 Emerigon 684; 2"Valin. 131;
Parker v. Jones, 13 Mass. 173; Richardson v. The Marine
Insurance Company, 6 Mass. 12, 114; Seaton v. Low, 1 Johns.
Cases 1; 2 Johns. Cases 77, 120 ; Phill. 280.
The mischief was, that the underwriters were liable, in cases
in which, they knew or were bound to know that the trade
was contraband or illicit, for a lawful seizure. The clause was
introduced to guard against, this mischief. It could never
have been regarded as a mischief, that the underwriters were
answerable for a seizure which was unlawful; and, consequently, the clause should not be construed to pxtend to such
a seizure.

SUPREME COURT.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

5. The consequences of a different construction are, that
they make the clause depend, not on the fact of contraband
and the law of contraband, but on the allegation, pretext and
false suggestion of the wrong-doer.
The policy protects against thieves, enemies, pirates; but
does not protect against a pirate or thief who robs with a lie in
his mouth. It makes the case of the assured, however innocent, fall before the false suggestions of a rogue.
These views are sustained by express decisions. Smith v.
The Delaware Insurance Company, 3 Serg. and R. 82; Faudel
v. The Phacnix Insurance Company, 4 Serg. and R. 59; 1
Gaines's Cases in Error 29; Johnstone v. Ludlow, 3 Johns.
Cases 481; Church v. Hubbard, 2 Cranch 187, 236, 1 Cond.
Rep. 385 ; 1 Marsh. 356 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 385, 393, 346; 12
Mass. 291 ; Pickering's Rep. 281.
Upon the second question-whether, assurr ing the other
facts to be as stated and alleged, and taking the authority
of the seizing vessel to be such as the plaintiffs allege, there
was a legal and justifiable cause for the seizure and detention
of the. General Carrington and her cargo-he contended,. that
on any supposition, there was no justifiable cause of seizure.
The only difference as to the facts under which the second
and third questions on which the judges were divided in opinion
is, that the authority of the seizing vessel, is by the plaintiffs
alleged to have- been of one kind, and by the defendants, of
another kind. The facts sustain the position of the plaintiffs.
The facts sustain the following positions:
1. That a seizure for contraband at Callao was illegal and
unjustifiable,. because there was no contraband on board; it
had all been previously landed in Chili. 2. There was nothing in the other facts to make the seizure legal, in consequence
of having previously carried contraband. 3. The seizure was
not lawful, because no contraband articles were on board at
the time of the seizure. This point of course depends on another: that to justify a seizure for contraband, the contraband
goods must be seized.
The character of contraband trade, jure belli, is in one respect peculiar. It is a trade which a neutral has a right to carry
on; and Which a belligerent has a right to intercept and to confiscate. It presents the case of conflicting rights. The neutral

ANUARY TERM 1834.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

to do, and the belligerent to prevent. If the neutral can carry
his right into effect or enjoyment, the belligerent cannot complain. If the belligerent can intercept him, and- prevent his
carrying it into effect, the neutral cannot complain. The neutral commits no offence by the successful attempt. The
belligerent commits none by defeating it. The contraband
article is alone the offence in the sight 'of the belligerent ; and
the only penalty is the confiscation of the article.
,These principles flow from authorities. Bynk. ch. x. Duponceau's translation, p. 74, 76, 80, 81'; Grotius book 3, ch.
1, 520 ; Vattel, book 3, ch. 7, sec. 111, 310 (503), sec. 113;

284; 1 Kent's Com. 132; Phillips 152; Seaton v. Low, I
Johns. Cases 1 ; 2 Johns. Cases 77, 120.
The doctrine of the English adjudication is, that the contraband articles mu~st be taken, the goods must be inter.cepted. It is wrong to say this must take place when they
are in delicto.' There is no delictum. 3 Rob. Adm. Rep. 138
(167).
But it is supposed that some English cases asserit the doctrine that if the contraband is carried outward, and the proceeds homeward, they are prize; and if carried out with false
papers, or under a false destination, that the penalty may be
inflicted on the ship or other goods of the same owner on the
homeward voyage.
This doctrine is a novelty, of which it is supposed no trace
in any earlier authority than cases decided in 1809, 1810, can
be found. These cases are the Baltic, and the Margaret, cited
in Chitty's Law of Nations 128, 143. In England, the doctrine is a novelty, merely the result of their principles in regard
to the colonial trade, under the rule of 1756; and has not been
applied to any other than a case of that trade. It is not the
law of nations, as understood by other nations, and shown by
their conventional law, particularly by Spain. In support of
these positions, cited, The Margaretta Magdalena, 2 Rob. 115 ;
The Rosalie and Betty, 2 Rob. 252; The Nancy, 3 Rob. 102;
The Franklin, 3 Rob. 178; 6 Rob. 390.
It is the doctrine of the British, under the rule of 1756,
which is, that, whether concealed or not, contraband outward

SUPREME COURT.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insuraiee Company.]

affected the proceeds home iand if concealed, affected the ship
and cargo. It proceeds on the principle, that the-whole trade
is illegal, except as the British release or permit it. This is
shown by the British orders. 4 Rob. appendix A; 7 Rob.
473, appendix, note 1; and the subsequent orders of council, in 2 Rob. 126, 31f, appendix, No. 1, 2; 5 Rob. 367, appendix.
This doctrine is an- interpolation, as the rule of 1756 was.
It has been rejected by the United- States. Message of the
president of the United States to congress, 27th January 1806,
5 Waites's State Papers 321. It is*entirely an English doctrine,
and modern English ; not admitted by other nations : and is
inapplicable to a voyage to Chili, which is not a relaxed trade,
but a trade to an independent country.
The general doctrine claimed for the -plaintiffs appears to
be sanctioned by the conventional law of nations, betweenthe
United States and foreign nations ; that concealment of contraband goods does not aggravate the case. With :England, by
the treaty of 1794, art. 17, 18-With France, by the treaty of
6th February 1778, art. 12, 13, 23 ; of 3d-September 1800,, art.

The French ordinance of 1681 expressly makes a provision
which excludes capture, unless contraband is 6n -board. 2

the treaty with Spain would seem to leave no doubt on this
subject.

5. There is

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Carrington and others v. The M rchants' Insurance Company.]

no allegation by the captors of any thing, but the landing of
contraband in Chili. 6. Chili is an independent state, and
was at the time recognized by the United States as such.
The attention of the court is asked to another suggestion.
The question is, whether the facts show a justifiable cause of
seizure within the exception: whether landing contraband at
Chili, is a justifiable case of seizure, and is within the exception?
It may be granted that it was a justifiable cause of seizure;,,
yet if it is not within 'the exception, then it was not a justifiable
cause of seizure to exonerate the underwriters: and the second and third questions must be so answered.
The exception excludes a loss by seizure for contraband
trade : the question is, contraband trade on whatkoyage ? Th6
answer is, contraband trade on the voyage insured from Coquimbo. The exception means not only seizure on the voyage
insured for trade or contraband, but seizure for contrabandtrade
on that voyage. This is the true interpretation of the clause.
Had not the exception been inserted, the policy would have
covered a loss by contraband trade on this voyage. The excep.
tion is intended to cut off this loss, and nothing more. The
goods are insured for this voyage, and the exception is of 'contrabanid in the same voyage.
Whether the underwriters are liable for a seizure made for
carrying contraband on a former -voyage may, or may not-be ;
but the d'i.agreement certified concerns the exception; and the
exception does not exclude contraband trade on any voyage
but that on which the seizure was made. Upon either hypothesis there was no justifiable cause of seizure, upon the second
and third questions.
4. Whether a general in the military service of Spain, subor.
dinate to La Serna, viceroy of Peru, under the king of Spain,
but having the actual and exclusive command of Callao, and
no civil authority existing therein, and cut off by the forces of
the enemy by sea and land from all communication with any
superior civil or military officer, could lawf-illy seize and detain
nputral property for contraband trade, if just. cause existed for
a condemnation thereof.
1. A lawful authority to seize, must exist to bring the case
vOL. vxII.-3 0

SUPREME COURT.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.)

within the exception. 2. A person so described had not lawful
authority to make the seizure.
1. The seizure must be by lawful authority. It has been
shown, that there must be a justifiable cause of seizure. It
follows, that the seizure must be by lawful authority, to come
within the 6xception.
A justifiable seizure is a cause which justifies the party who
makes the seizure. If he is not authorised to seize, the trade
does not justify the seizure, and is not a justifiable cause of
seizure. The lawfulness of a seizure, necessarily regards the
party who seizes, as much as the offender.
This is not only logically, but it is practically so, under this
exception. A seizure by a neutral, by a pirate, by the very person with whom the contraband trade is carried on, would all
be included, if lawful authority to seize were not necessary. A
seizure by any one who has no right to seize, is an act of mere
violence and unlawful force. The trade can be no more than
a pretence or pretext to such a person. The policy covers all
risks on contraband, except the lawful penalties of the trade.:
the losses lawfully arising from it. But seizure without
authority is not one of them; but, in terms, is a loss unlawfully
arising.
Every seizure without authority is a trespass and wrong, and
the policy means to protect the assured against such injuries.
If the laws of Spain did not prevent a seizure by Rodil, or by
a vessel under his comm ission, the same laws made the seizure
unlawful. The court must hold, that the contraband did not
justify -thatseizure ; was not a justifiable cause of seizure.
The clause does not mean a justifiable cause of seizure in the
abstract, but a cause justifying the particular seizure. It
means a seizure according to law, and a trade against the law
which justifies him who seizes.
The seizure was not made by lawful "authority in this case.
This depends on the law of Spain. Proceedings by a competent court, affirming, the seizuke and condemning the goods,
might be evidence of authority to seize ; but in this case, there
are no such proceedings. The authority of Rodil must be shown by the law of Spain. It is a question to be settled by
that law ; for unless by that law there was authority to make
the seizure, it was unlawful.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

There is nothing in the particular circumstances set forth in
this question, from which the court can infer a lawful authority
in Rodil. The circumstances, as stated, do not confer it by
force of any principles that are applicable to the case as described. Whether a general so separated can lawfully seize,
must depend upon the power that the laws of his own country
give him. The case of necessity it supposes, may be sufficient
if his sovereign so wills ; but not otherwise.
But so far from the acts of Rodil being authorised by the
laws of Spain, by those laws this act was piratical. The commission to make prize of war must issue from a different officer,
from the commandant railitar de ]a marina; or if there be no
such officer, it must be issued by the captain-general of the
province.
5. Whether such officer, so situated, has a right to appoint
and constitute a court, of which he himself is one, for the trial
and condemnation of such property.
The court in question, like all other courts, must proceed
from the sovereign power of the nation. This principle is particularly true as regards prize courts, whose judgments affect
the public relations of the country. It is due to other nations,
that such court should be authorised by the sovereign power,
and by that power only. 2 Azuni 262; 2 Bro. Civil and Ad.
Law 331; 1 Wash. C. C. R. 271, 3 Binney 239.
If the constitution of the court is not known, it will be presumed to be legal. If known, and is not according to what is
usual among civilized nations, it must be proved to have been
enacted by competent authority. The erection of a court is
the act of the sovereign; nothitng is to be presumed in favour
of a court erected by a military commander.
Is such a court as the question supposes, usual among civilized nations ? Appointed by a military commander ; appointing himself as one of the judges? Possibly the law, the
sovereign, may authorise such a tribunal: but it cannot be presumed; because it is unusual, and to the highest degree dangerous to' the rights of individuals, and to the peace of the
public.
The existence of the power to appoint courts in the hands
of a subject, is unknown in the practice of nations ; that of a
power to appoint the court, himself a judge, is monstrous. The

defendants must show the law for it, or the negative must
be adopted. But the laws of Spain are the other way. 3
Recop. 125, art. 11, 12, 13.
6. Whether, supposing the ship to have traded in articles
contraband of war in the ports of Chili, andrto have been seized
afterwards in a port of Peru, then under the royal authority,
before she bad discharged her outward cargo, for and on account of such contraband trade, the underwriters be not dis-charged ; whether the subsequent proceedings for her adjudication were regular or irregular.
1. There must be a lawful seizure. 2. A lawful cause of
.seizure. 3. Loss by this cause. The question is, whether
lawful adjudication is the only proof. No instance has occurred in which there has been a decision that a loss was
within the exception, without such an adjudication. Church
v. Hubbard, 2 Cranch 187, 1, Cond Rep. 390, requires it.
It is the duty of the captors to proceed to a regular adjudication. The question is, whether the seizure legally affects the
property, or what is the operation of law upon the thing taken 1
How is this proved . Force is not a title which the *0rld
respects, without the aid of law to sanction it. There being
two kinds of force, lawful and lawless force, the usages of the
civilized world require, that all claims to property by an act
of force, should be shown to be lawful force by the adjudication
of a competent tribunal. Wheaton nn Cap. 262, 274.
What is a lawful court? It is a court 6f the nation under
whose laws, and by whose authority the seizure has been made,
and the thing taken is possessed. This is so in the case of a
seizure under municipal law. Hudson v. Guestieri 2 Cond.
Rep. 110. If it be a capture as prize of war, this same principle prevails. Wheaton on Cap. 261. Such'a court alone has
jurisdiction. Adjudications by any other are null and void for
want of jurisdiction. The sentence of such a court regularly
pronounced, is universally respected ; and isconclusive as to
its direct effect, and as to the facts directly decided by it.
Wheaton on Cap. 274; 4 Cranch Rep. 434, 2 Cond. Rep.
162.
These principles will not be questioned as to the property
seized. No court can consider a title as passing but by such
an adjudication. Every court must consider the seizure as

JANUARY TERM 183I4.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Ilsurance Company.]

an act of mere force, until its legality is ,adjudged by such a
cout,
The same is true. as to questions of the same kind collaterally
arising under a policy of insurance. The court is bound to
hold the same doctrine in a collateral inquiry, as if the-property
were brought before them.
This court has said, that if adjudication is not obtained in
reasonable time, the seizure must be regarded as trespass.
Hudson v. Guestier, 2 Cond. Rep. 112. If it is to be so regarded in questions of title to property, it must be so as to
every question concerning that trespass.
. The unaerwriter who sets up the capture, is bound to prove
the very fact that the property was lawfully lost by a seizure
for contraband trade. The utmost this court can say is, that
it ought to have been so lost: but nothing can show that it
was lost according to the law of another country, but The judgment of a competent court.
The difficulty in a case ofprize is insuperable. A court of
common law-cannot adjudge it. It belongs to the prize courts,
both the direct and consequential question. Doug. 594, 613;

This court has regarded the condemnation as necessary to
bring the cane within the exception. Church v. Hubbard,
2 Cranch 187, 1 Cond. Rep. 390.
Mr Franklin Dexter, for the defendants.
The answer to the first questioh must depend on the sense
iti
which the word cause is to be understood. If it means, as
the counsel for the plaintiff seems to contend, the actual state of
the facts, in contemplation of which the seizure was made, the
question must be answered in the negative : because to answer
it in the affirmative, would be to require that to discharge the
underwriters, legal and justifiable cause of condemnation, as
well as of seizure and detention, must have existed. Such is
not the language of the question, nor of the exception in the
policy. It is said, on the other side, that a vessel cannot with
propriety be said to be seized for or on account of contraband
trade, unless such trade had been carried on. We think the
common useof language does not require this. Itis not unusual
to say, that claims are made, suits, brought, and even judg-

SUPREME COURT.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

ments rendered, for or on account of a cause of action, without
meaning to affirm that the cause exists in point of fact. It
would surelybe no solecism to say, that the General Carrington
had been seized for contraband trade, but on examination was
found innocent and discharged. We understand the word
cause in the question, and the words for or on account of in the
policy, to relate to the motive of the seizers; and that any seizure is for and on account of contraband, which is made because
the party bona fide believes such contraband trade to have
been carried on. It is a question of good faith ; involving of
course the question of probable cause on the one hand, and of
wanton and lawless violence on the other. It is said, if such
be the construction, seizures under mere pretext of contraband
trade will discharge the underwriter; and that the motive cannot be proved. We answer, that the question of probable cause
is always open to the party, indicative of the motive, and
can be tried by a jury as well as in other causes. We think,
this construction will reconcile the apparent contradictions of
the cases cited. Those in which it is said, that there must
have been both illicit trade and a seizure on account of it, arose
under exceptions of breaches of foreign municipal laws, where
the question was not as to the fact of trading; but whether the
prohibitory law actually existed, and was binding on the party.
The case of Church' v. Hubbard, so much relied on, was decided on'the want of sufficient proof of the alleged law of Spain;
and the dicta of the court which have been cited, were mere
concessions tocounsel, made arguendo. Taking the whole opinion in that case together, we think it plainly takes the distinction
between bona fide and colourable seizures. This is confirmed
by the case of Livingston and Gilchrist v. The Maryland Insurance Company, 7 Cranch 506, 2 Cond. Rep. 589; which
turned, like the present, on a question of national law. The
court there decided, that an actual breach of the law of nations,
was not necessary to discharge the underwriters.
The argument drawn from the proviso of the exception,
that the judgment of a foreign consular or colonial court, shall
not be conclusive of the fact of contraband goods having been
on board, is canied too far. That proviso does not imply, that
the fact of such goods having been on board, was thought necessary to the discharge of the underwriter ! but only, that a

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

fact so material in determining the character of the seizure,
shall not be conclusively determined by the courts of the captors. It is a fact to be submitted to a jury, to show probable
cause for the seizure, or the want of it.
It is admitted, that the language of some of the cases cited,
would seem at first to favour the position taken for the plaintiffs;
but when taken in connection with the facts before the court,
they will be found consistent with the view of the defendants.
In other cases, equally respectable dicta may be found, expressly recognizing the doctrine that actual delinquency is not
necessary to discharge the underwriter. Livingston and Gilchrist v. The Maryland Insurtnce Company; Radcliffe v. The
United Insurance Company, 7 Johns. R. 38.
The law of Massachusetts is the lex loci contractus ; and in
the case of Higginson v. Pomroy, 11 Mass. Rep. 104, this is
very clearly stated.
The case of Smith v. The Delaware Insurance Company,
was decided chiefly on the ground that the foreign law did not
extend to the territory in which the seizure was made.
Faudel v. The Phmenix Insurance Company, was decided on
the ground, that the sentence of the court showed that the
seizure was not within the exception. There is no case which
refuses to discharge the underwriter under this exception, because the captors have been honestly mistaken in the facts.
This point, however, is of little importance to the present case,
because there is no dispute about facts.
Mr Webster, for the defendants, considered the case under
three heads. 1. The contract, as to its nature and object.
2. The facts applicable to the case under the policy. 3. The
law growing out of the facts.
1. As to the exception in the policy, and the risks assumed
by the undertakers under it; he contended, that they took
upon them no risks for or on account of contraband goods, or
illicit trade. The words of the exception are the same as if
they were in the form of a warranty by the assured. All risl s
which are fairly to be laid to the account of itlicit or contraband trade, were not taken by the insurers, but were to be
borne by the owner. The underwriters assumed all sea risks,
and the other risks enumerated in the policy.

SUPREME COURT.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

The voyage was from Providence to where the outward
cargo was to be landed. The ship was to enter at Valparaiso
under a false pretence-the want of water, and then proceed to
Coquimbo, where the risk was to commence on the 5th of
June 1824.. The ground of the plaintiffs' claim must be for seizure and detention, as all the counts in the declaration allege
that as the cause of the loss, except one, which asserts a loss
by piratical seizure.
The seizure was the cause of the loss, and this is alleged to
have been for contraband or prohibited trade.
Was this the true causeI If it was, the underwriters are
excused; but if there was not such a seizure, then the underwriters are liable under the general words in the body of the
policy.
There can be no doubt, but that the contraband trade was
the cause of the loss : if there had been no contraband trade,
there would have been no seizure.
It is said, the seivure was too late ; but this is not a question
for the underwriters. It is enough that the seizure was actually on account of contraband trade, Probable cause was
enough, whether there was cause or not for condemnation.
Cited, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 127; Higginson v. Pomroy, 11 Mass.
Rep. 104, 110. The contract in the present suit was made in
Massachusetts : if there 'is any discrepancybetween the law of
different states, the lex. loci must govern. The cases in 7
Johns. 38, and 9 Johns. 281, fully sustain the ground assumed
for the defendants.
The excuse is that the vessel was not taken in delicto. If
this be so, it is a question with which the underwriters have
no concern.
But this assertion is denied. When the vessel was seized,
a state of facts existed which warranted the seizure and condemnation. The risk was produced by the conduct'of the
plaintiffs, and was not assumed by the underwriters. By their
conduct the vessel was forfeited; .and nothing but the form of
a condemnation was wanted.
The rule of 1756 is not necessarily involved in the decision
of this case ; but it is denied that any new rule in international
law was then introduced. That rule arose out of the war of

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

1756 ; and it was established to prevent the trade of the Dutch
with the French colonies, under Danish licenses.
To show that it was the ancient, and well settled law of
nations, that trading in contraband goods forfeited the vessel,
cited' 3 Rob. Ad. Rep. 1T"8, and note, The relaxation of lthe
law was, that the articles only should be seized when taken in
delicto; excusing the ship and innocent cargo. If there was
a fraudulent destination originally, the ancient rule applied;
the vessel and the innocent cargo were forfeited on account of
the fraud.
When the vessel is forfeited for carrying on contraband trade,
you may pursue her until she is taken ; but public convenience
requires a limit, and that limit is fixed by universal assent, to
the end of the voyage. The same rule exists as to all seizures
for breach of revenue laws. In Chitty's Law of Nations 128,
is the case of a vessel seized on the outward voyage.
There is necessarily a difference as to the right of seizure for
illicit trade, and for trade in contraband articles. In the first
case, the vessel was in the prohibited port ; in the latter, she
was not, but is in a neutral port. In the present case, there
could not have been a visitation and search; for her false papers
showed she was bound to the Sandwich Islands and Canton.
If this is a common practice, it is so much' the worse. But
this can have no operation on the rights or exemptions of the
derwriters ; for it would have no effect on the right of the
elligerent to seize. Cited, 6 Rob. 376, note; The Edward,
4 Rob. 56.
It is insisted, that it is not necessary to show there was cause
for condemnation. If there was cause for seizure, it is sufficient under the exception in the policy to discharge the underwriters. In the cases cited for the plaintiffs, it may have been
shown there was not cause for condemnation; but in those
cases it was considered there was cause for seizure. 3 Rob.
138, 141 ; 2 Rob. 115; 1 Acton 25, 333.
The sixth poipt was intended to raise the question, whether
the underwriters could be discharged before condemnation.
This would delay the ouestion of their liability until a condemnation ; and this cannot be.
Mr Sergeant, in reply, stated, that the form of the policy
VOL. vim.-3

P

[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

adopted in this case, has been in use in Boston since 1823; and
the exception as to illicit trade, is in all the policies in the
United States ; the part as to contraband trade only is new.
The principle adopted by the clause had long been recognized
in the courts of the United States.
The situation of the country at the time of the seizure was
peculiar. Chili had actually established her independence.
The possession of Rodil was temporary and accidental; and
whenlever actual possession of any place came into the hands
of the officers of Spain, the laws of the Indies applied; and all
trade with the place became illegal.
There must be an interpretatibn of the contract, consistent
with the bona fide intentions of both parties to it. The parties
had no reference to any thing which had taken place before
the policy attached, on the 5th June 1824, at Coquimbo. The
policy is dated in October 1824, and was on the property,
"lost or not lost."
When the policy attached, the vessel had no contraband articles on board, and never afterwards had; and it may be presumed, that the underwriters knew she had some contraband
goods on board. She had not the proceeds of the contraband
goods on board when she was seized in Quilca by an armed
vessel.
The whole of the questions in the case turn on the construction of the clause of exception.
The first question is, whether the seizure was for a justifiable
cause. It must be legal and justifiable, or there was no cause
at all. The court cannot say, whether the seizure was bona
fide. Nor can they say whether there was probable cause or
not. They have not the evidence before them. There must
be a legal and justifiable cause, or there is no cause.
The clause is not a warranty; it is an exception. A warranty is not of the like effect as an exception, The interpretation of the clause was settled in principle, before it was inserted
in policies. It was so settled in 1804, in the case of Church
v. Hubbard, 2 Cranch 187, 1 Cond. Rep. 385; which was a
Massachusetts case; so 2 Wash. C. C. R. 130, decided in
1807; 3 Serg. and Rawle 74, decided in 1817; 4 Serg. and
Rawle 59; 1 Caines's Cases 29, decided in 1801 ; 2 Johns.
Cases 481 ; Marshall on Insurance 346, published in 1810.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

There never has been a decision to the contrary. 'the princi-.
ple the plaintiffs claim and rest the case upon is,that there
must be a legal and justifiable cause of seizure, and one which
would justify a condemnation. Higginson v. Pomroy, 1 Mass.
104, when examined, sustains this principle.
The clause allows the contraband trade to be carried on, but
at the risk of the assured : and it rests with the underwriters
to show that the seizure was for an unlawful and prohibited
trade. A mere lawless seizure is not, therefore, within the
exception. The law, as understood, made the underwriters
liable in a case like this, and the exception was introduced to
excuse them.
The specific kind of loss must be by seizure or detention.
Mere allegation, of course, will not do. The cause must be
shown by a condemnation.
Contraband is a lawful trade, as has been decided in the
courts of the United States; and this court will not now pronounce such a trade illegal, and expose the whole vessel and
cargo to condemnation. This is the doctrine contended for on
the other side.
It is denied that the principle of the law of nations authorises a seizure and condemnation after the goods are landed.
The cases cited by the opposite side, do not support the position;
and it is exclusively British doctrine. There never is an adhering taint when the offending article was lawful, and no
proceeds of it on board, or when there is not a false destination;
neither of which existed in this case.
This court would not condemn the. cargo for what the vessel
had done with respect to contraband. The case of the Santissima Trinidad, 7 Wheat. 292, 5 Cond. Rep. 284; and the
cases in New York show that contraband trade is lawful.
, The fourth question is founded on the assumption, that this
was enemy's property. It is admitted, that if it had been, any
onemay seize. But it is denied to have been enemy's property.
It may have been liable to seizure, jure belli ; but this must be
under the commission of a regular privateer, when a neutral is
concerned. The neutral has the'right to claim the benefit of
being carried in and tried by a regular tribunal, established by
the sovereign of the country. It then becomes the act of'the
government, which is accountable to the injured party.

SUPREME COURT.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

The three last questions, in order to be decided in favour of
the underwriters, must decide that it is immaterial how, or in
what manner the seizure was made, if the, trade had been a
trading in contraband. Unless the court was legally constituted, the trial and condemnation were nothing, and were absolutely void.
Mr Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.
After stating the case he proceeded :
This cause comes before the court upon a certificate of a
division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court for, the
district of Massachusetts.
I Upon the trial of the cause upon the evidence, the parties
propounded certain questions, upon which the circuit court
(with the assent of the parties), certified a division of opinion,
for the purpose of obtaining the final decision of this court in
regard to them.
-Thefirst ip, whether a seizure and detention, to come within
the exception of the policy relating to contraband and illicit
trade, must be for a legal and justifiable cause. The questi6n
here propounded is not whether there must be a legal or justifiable cause for condemnation ; but simply, whether there must
not be such cause for the seizure and detention. .And we are
of opinion, that the question ought to be answered in the affirmative. The language of the exception; when properly construed, leads to this conclusion ; and it is confirmed.by authorities standing upon analogous clauses. The language is, "the
assurers shall not be liable for any charge, damage or loss
which may arise in consequence of seizure or detention for or
on account of illicit -trade, or trade in articles contraband of
war." It is not, then, every seizure or detention which is
excepted ; but such only as is made for, and on acceant of a
particular trade. A seizure or detention, which is .a mere act
of lawless violence, wholly unconnected with any supposed
illicit or corntraband trade, is not within the terms or spirit of the
exception. And as little is a seizure or detention not bona fide
made upon a just suspicion of illicit or contraband trade, but
the latter used as a mere pretext or colour for an act of lawless violence ; for under such circumstances, it can in no just
sense- be said to be made for or- on account of such trade.

'JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Carrington an& othars v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

It is a mere fraud to cover a wanton trespass; a pretence and
not a cause for the tort. To bring a case, then, within the
exception, the seizure or detention must be bona fide, and
upon a reasonable ground. If there has not been an actual
illicit or contraband trade, there must at least be a well founded
suspicion of it, a probable cause to impute guilt, and justify
further proceedings and inquiries ; and this is what the law
deems a legal and justifiable cause for the seizure or detention.
The general words of the policy cover the risks of restraints
and detainments of all kings, princes and people. The exception withdraws from it such as are bona fide made for, and on
account of illicit or contraband trade. So that, upon the mere
terms of the exception, there would not seem any real ground
for doubt. But if there were, the next succeeding clause associated with it, demonstrates that such must have been the
understanding of tfe parties. It is there said, that the judgment of a foreign consular or colonial court shall not be cortclusive upon the parties as to the fact of there having been
articles contraband of war on board, or as to the fact of an
attempt to trade in violation of the laws of nations. Now, if a
mere lawless seizure or detention, under the pretext of illicit
and contraband trade, were within the exception ; the inqiry,
whether there had been contraband articles on board, or an
attempt of illicit trade, would be in most, if not in all cases
wholly unimportant and nugatory to the assured, for whose
benefit the clause is introduced ; since the sentence would always establish a pretence for the seizure and detention, although
not a justifiable cause for it. The reasonable interpretatiop of
the clause must be, that it was introduced to enable the assured
to disprove the existence of justifiable cause for the seizure or
detention, by showing that the facts did not waf'adit it.
We think that the authorities cited at the bar, lead to the
same conclusion. In Church v. Hubbard, 2 Cranch 187, 2
Cond. Rep. 385 ; where the exception was, " that the insurets
do not take the risk of illicit trade with the Portuguese, and
the insurers are not liable- for seizure by the Portuguese for
illicit trade ;" the main question Was, whether an attempt to
trade, not consummated by actual trading, was within the
exception. The court held that it was. On that occasion the
chief justice said, "no seizure, not justifiable under the laws
and regulations established by the .'rown of Portugal for the

SUPREME COURT.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

restriction of foreign commerce with its dependencies,,can come
within this part of the contract ; and every seizure which is
justifiable bythose laws and regulations must be deemed within
it." And applying this language to the circumstances of the
present case, we may add, that no seizure or detention not justifiable by the law of.nations can come within, the present
exception, and'every seizure which is justifiable by the law
of nations, must be deemed within it. The cases of Smith
v. The Delaware Insurance Company, 3 Serg. and Rawle
74 ; and Faudel v. The Phoenix Insurance Company, 4 Serg.
and Rawle 29; Johnston and Weir v. Ludlow, 1 Caines's Cas.
in Error 29; S. C. 2 Johns. Cas. 481,(a) adopt a similar
doctrine, if they do not proceed beyond it. The case of Higginson v. Pomroy, 11 Mass. R. 104, contained an exception of
"illicit trade with the Spaniards ;" and the court held, that
the exception extended toevery seizure and detention suggested
by the prohibitions of trade and intercourse, as the means of
enforcing them ; and whether of prevention or -of punishment
for infraction ; and that, therefore, it extended to cases where
the charge of illicit trade with the Spaniards might be ultimately repelled; and where the property seized might be in
consequence acquitted under the circumstances: of the particular case. But this supposes that there was probable or. justifiable cause for the seizure, bona fide existing ; and the court
explicitly assented to the general doctrine in Church v. Hubbard. It is true, that the learned chief justice, in delivering
the opinion of the court, added, that "perhaps (we may add),
although not necessary to the present decision, even arbitrary
acts of the Spanish colonial governments, if assumed to be
justified on their parts by the prohibitions of trade and intercourse, are, we think, within the exception of seizure for illicit
trade." This is professedly a mere dictum of the court; and
giving it every reasonable force as authority, it proceeds on the
supposition that such arbitrary acts are bona fide done, and are
not mere pretexts to cover an illegal seizure.

The second question is, whether, assuming the other facts
to be as stated and alleged above, and taking the authority of
the seizing vessel to be such as the plaintiffs allege (that is to
say, of an armed vessel fitted out and commissioned at Callao
(a) See also Laing v. United insurance Company, 2 Johns. Cas. 174; S. C.
2 Johns. Cas.487.; Tucker v(Juhel I Johns. R. 20.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

by Rodil), there was a legal and justifiable cause for the
seizure of the General Carrington and her cargo. The third
is precisely the same in terms, except taking the authority of
the armed vessel to be such as the defendants allege (that is
to say, to be an armed vessel sailing under the royal Spanish
flag, and acting by the royal authority of Spain).
Both these questions present the same general point, whether
there was, under the circumstances of the case, a legal and
justifiable cause for the seizure and detention of the ship and
her cargo. The facts material to be taken into consideration
in ascertaining this point are, that the ship, when seized, had
not landed all her outward cargo, but was still in the progress
of the outward voyage originally designated, by the owners;
that she sailed on that voyage from Providence with contraband articles on board, belonging, with the other pearts of the
cargo, to the owners of the ship; with a falsedestination and
false papers, which yet accompanied the vessel.; that the Gantraband articles had been landed, before the policy, which is a
policy on time, designating no particular voyage, had attached;
that the underwriters, though taking no risks within the exception, were not ignorant of the nature and objects of the
voyage; and that the alleged cause of the seizure and detention was, the trade in articies contraband of war by the landing of the powder and muskets already mentioned.
If by the principles of the law of nations there existed under
these circumstances, a right to seize and detain the -ship and
her remaining cargo, and to subject them to adjudication for a
supposed forfeiture, notwithstanding the prior deposit of the
contraband goods ; then the questions must be answered in the
affirmative, that there was a legal and justifiable cause.
According to the modern law of nations, for there has been
some. relaxation in practice from. the strictness of the ancient rules, the carriage of contraband goods to the enemy,
subjects them, if. captured, in delicto, to the penalty of confiscation ; but the vessel and the remaining cargo, if they do not
belong to the owner of the -contraband goods, are not subject
to the same penalty.: The penalty is applied to the latter, only
when there has been some actual co-operation, on their part, in
a meditated fraud upon the belligerents ; by covering up-the
voyage under false papers, and, with a false destination. This

SUPREME COUiRT.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Comnpany.]

is the general doctrine when the capture is made in transitu,
while the contraband goods are yet on board. But when the
contraband goods have been deposited at the port of destination, and the 'subsequent voyage has thus been disconnected
with the noxious articles, it has not been usual to apply the
penalty to the ship or cargo upon the return voyage, although
the latter may be the proceeds of the contraband. And the
same rule would seem by analogy, to apply to cases where the
contraband articles have been deposited at an intermediate
port on the outward voyage, and before it had terminated ;
although there is-not any authority directly in point. But in
the highest prize courts of England, while the distinction between the outward and homeward voyage is admitted to
govern, yet it is established, that it exists only in favour of
neutrals who conduct themselves with fairness and good faith
in the arrangements of the voyage. If, with a view to practise
a fraud'upon the belligerent, and to escape from his acknowledged right of capture and detention, the voyage is disguised,
and the vessel sails under false papers, and with a false destination, the mere depositof the contraband in the course of the
voyage, is not allowed to purge away the guilt of the fraudulent conduct of the neutral. In the case of the Franklin, in
1801, 3 Rob. 217, lord Stowell said, -"1 have deliberated upon
this case, and desire it to be considered as the settled rule of
law received by this court, that the carriage of contraband with
a false destination, will make a condemnation of the ship, as
well as the cargo." "Shortly afterwards, in the case of the
Neutralitet, 1801, 3 Rob. R. 295, he added, "the modei'n rule
of the law'of nations is, certainly, that the ship shall not be
subject to condemnation for carrying contraband goods. The
ancient practice was otherwise; and it cannot be denied that
it was perfectly justifiable in principle. If to supply the enemy
with such articles is a noxious act with respect to the owner
of the cargo, the vehicle which is instrumental in effecting
that illegal purpose, cannot be innocent. The policy of modern times has, however, introduced a relaxation on this point ;
and the general rule now is, that the vessel does not become

papers'; these circumstances of aggravation have been held to
constitute excepted cases out of the modern rule, and to continue them under the ancient rule." The cases in which this
language was used, were cases of capture upon the outward
voyage.(a) The same doctrine was afterwards held by the
same learned judge to apply to cases, where the vessel had
sailed with false papers, and a false destination upon the outward voyage, and was captured on the return voyage.(b)
And, finally, in the cases of the Rosalia and the Elizabeth, in
1802, 4 Rob. R., note to table of cases, the ords of appeal in
prize cases held, that the carriage of contraband outward with
false papers, will affect the return cargo with condemnatibn.
These cases are not reported at large. But in the case of thre
Baltic, 1 Acton's R. 25, and thitt of the Margaret, 1 Acton's R.
333, the lords of appeal deliberately reaffirmed the same doctrine.
In the latter case, sir William Grant, in pronouncing the judgment of the court said, "the principle upon which this and
other 'prize courts have generally proceeded to adjudication in
cases of this nature (that is, where there are false papers), appears simply to be this ; that if a vessel carried contraband on
the outward voyage, she is liable to condemnation on the
homeward voyage. It is by no means necessary that th vargo
.,hould have been purchased by the proceeds of this contralSaxid.
Hence we must pronounce against this appeal; the sentence
(of condemnation) of the court below being perfectly valid and
consistent with the acknowledged principles of general law."
We cannot but consider these decisions as very high evidence
of the law of nations, as actually administered : and in their
actual application to the circumstances of the present case,
they are not,, in 'our judgment, controlled by any opposing
authority. Upon principle, too, we trust, that there is great
soundness in the doctrine, as a reasonable interpretation of the
law of nations. The belligerent has a right to require a frank
and bona fide conduct on the part of neutrals, in. the course
of their commerce in times of war; and if the latter will make
use of fraud, and false papers, to elude the just rights of the
belligerents, and to cloak their own illegal purposes, there is

no injustice in applying to them the penalty of confiscation,
The taint of the fraud travels with the party and his offending
instrument during the whole course of the voyage, and until
the enterprise has,.in the understanding of the party himself,
completely terminated. There are many analogous cases in
the prize law, where fraud is followed by similar penalties.
Thus, if a neutral will cover up enemy's property under false
papers, which also cover his own property, prize courts will not.
disentangle the one from the other, but condemn the whole as
good prize. That doctrine was solemnly affirmed in this court,
in the case of the St Nicholas, I Wheaton 417, 3 Cond. Rep.
614.
Upon the whole, our opinion is, that the general question
involved in the second and third questioni, whether there was
a legal and justifiable cause of capture under the circumstances
of the present case, ought to 'be answered in the affirmative.
The question, as to the authority of the cruiser to seize, so far
as it depends.upon her commission, can only be answered in a
general way. If she had a commission under the royal authority of Spain, she was beyond question entitled to make the
seizure. If Rodil had due authority to grant the commission,
the same result would arise. If he had no such authority, then
she must be treated as a non commissioned cruiser, entitled to
seize for the benefit of the crown; whose acts, if adopted and
acknowledged by the crown or its competent authorities, beoome equally binding. Nothing is better settled both in England and America, than the doctrine, that a non commissioned cruiser may seize for the benefit of the government; and
if his acts are adopted by the government, the property, when
condemned, becomes a droit of the government. (a)
The fourth and fifth questions involve the point as to the
authority of Rodil. The fourth is in the following terms.
Whether a general in the military service of Spain, subordinate
to La- Serna, viceroy of Peru, under the king of Spain, not
having the actual and exclusiVe command at Callao, and no
civil authority existing therein, and cut off by the forces of the

enemy by sea or land from all communication with any superior civil or military officer, could lawfully seize and detain
neutral property from contraband trade, if just cause existed
for a condemnation thereof. The fifth question is,, whether
such oAicer,-so situated, has a right to appoint and constitute
a court, of which he himself is one, for the trial and'condemnation of such property. These questions are both understood
to refer to the supposed authority of Rodil as an officer of the
government, to make the seizure in his official capacity. We
are of opinion, that no sufficient facts are stated to enable this
court to give any opinion as to the nature or extent of the
authority of such an officer under the laws of Spain, or his
commission from and under the Spanish government. We
shall therefore return an answer to them, declaring that they
are too imperfectly stated to admit of any opinion to be giver.
by this court.
The sixth and last question is, whether, supposing the shi
1
to have traded in articles contraband of war in the ports ol
Chili, and to have been seized afterwards in a port of Peru,
then under the royal authority, before she had discharged her
outward cargo, for and on account of such contraband trade,
the,underwriters be not discharged, whether the subsequent
proceedings for her adjudication were regular' or irregular.
This question is understood to raise the point, whether, if the
seizure and detention be bona fide for and on account of illicit
or contraband trade, a sentence of condemnation or acquittal,
or other regular proceedings to adjudication, are necessary to
discharge the underwriters. We are of opinion that they are
not. If the seizure or detention be lawfully made for or on
account of illicit or contraband trade, all charges, damages
and losses consequent thereon, are within the scope of the exception. They are properly attributable to such seizure and
detention as the primary cause, and relate back thereto. If
the underwriters be discharged from the primary hostile act,
they are discharged from the consequences of it. The whole
reasoning in Church v. Hubbard, 2 Cranch 187, presupposes, that if the underwriters be exempted from the risk of a
justifiable seizure for illicit trade, they are not accountable for
losses consequent thereon, whether arising from a sentence of
condemnation or otherwise,

SUPREME COURT.
[Carrington and others v. The Merchants' Insurance Company.]

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the circuit court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, and on the points and questions on
which the judges of the said circuit court were divided in
opinion, and which were certified to this court for its opinion,
agreeably to the act of congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof,
it is ordered and adjudged by this court, that upon the question
so certifiedby the circuit court for the district of Massachusetts,
upon which the judges of that court were opposed in opiwion,
the opinions of this court be certified to that court as follows,
to wit :-Upon the first question, "whether a seizure and detention, to come within the exception of the policy relating to
contraband and illicit trade, must be for a legal and justifiable
cause." That it is the opinion of this court, that the seizure
and d&tention, to come within the exception of the policy relating to contraband and illicit trade, must be for a legal and
justifiable cause. Upon the second question, "whether, assuming the other facts to be as stated and alleged above, and
taking the authority of the seizing vessel to be such as the
plaintiffs allege there was a legal and justifiable cause for the
seizure and detenti,,n of the General Carrington and her cargo."
That it is the opiniola of this court, that assuming the facts
stated in that question, there was a legal and justifiable cause
for the seizure and detention of the ship General Carrington
and cargo. Upon the third question, "whether, assuming
the other facts to be as stated and alleged above, and taking
the authority of the seizing vessel to be such as the defendants
allege, there was a legal and justifiable cause for the seizure and
datention of the General Carrington and her cargo." That it
is the opinion of this court, assuming the facts stated in that
question, there was a legal and justifiable cause for the seizure
of the ship General Carrington and cargo. If the armed vessel referred to was lawfully commissioned by Rodil, (upon
which this court can pronounce no opinion) then she is to be
deemed entitled to make the seizure and detention in the same
manner as if she had been commissioned by the royal authority of Spain. "But if she was not so commissioned, then the
parties making the seizure and detention are to be treated as
non commissioned cruisers, seizing for the government of Spain ;

and their validity depends upon their adoption and recognition
by the competent authorities of Spain, according to the general
principles of the law of nations on this subject. Upon the
-fourth question, "whether a general in the military.service of
Spain, subordinate to La Serna, viceroy of Peru, under the
king of Spain, but having the actual and exclusive command
of Callao, and no civil authority existing therein, and cut' off
by the forces of the enemy by sea and land from all communication with any superior civil or military officer, cduld lawfully'seize and detain neutral property for contraband trade, if
just cause existed for a-condemnation thereof." And the fifth
question, "whether such officer, so situated, has a, right to
appoint and constitute a court, of which he himself is one, for
the trial and condemnation of such propelty." That it is the
opinion of this, court, that the facts are too imperfectly stated to
enable this court to ascertain and decide what are the nature and
extent of the powers of such an officer,'according
to the laws of
Spain, or his commission from and under the Spanish governiment. Upon the sixth question, "whether, supposing the ship
to have traded in articles contraband of war in the ports of Chili,
and to have been seized afterwards in a port of Peru, then under
the royal authority, before she discharged her outward cargo,
for and on account of such contraband trade, the underwriters
be not discharged, whether the subsequent proceedings for her
adjudication were regular or irregular." That it is the opinion of this court, that under the circumstances stated in that
question; the underwriters are discharged, whether the subsequent proceedings, after the seizure and detention of the ship
and cargo for their adjudication, were irregular or not.
