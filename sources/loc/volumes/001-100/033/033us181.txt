WILLIAM

ROBINSON, JUN., PLAINTIFF IN ERROR V. WILLIAM
NOBLE'S ADMINISTRATORS.

N. stipulated in certain articles of agreement to transport and deliver by the
steamboat Paragon to R. a certain quantity of subsistence stores, supposed
to amount to three thousand seven hundred barrels, for the use of the United
States: in consideration whereof R. agreed to pay to N., on, the delivery of
the.stores at St Louis, at a certain rate per barreli one half in specie funds,
or their equivaent, and the other half to be paid in Cincinnati, in the paper
of banks current there at the period of the delivery of the stores at St Louis.
Under the agreement was the following memorandum. " It is understood
that the payment to be nade in Cincinnai, is to be in the paper of the
Miami Exporting Company or its equivalent."
The court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the plIaintiffs could only
recover the stipulated price for the freight actually transported, and that
they were entitled to -no more than the specie value of the notes of the
Miami Exporting Company Bank, at the time the payment should have
been made at Cincinnati. The specie value of the notes, at the time they
should have been paid, is the rule by which such damages are to be estimated.
The plaintiff; the owner of the steamboat, was not entitled under the contract.
to recover in damages more than the stipulated price for the freight actually
transported. If R. had bound himself to deliver a certain number of barrels,
and had failed to do so, N. would have been entitled to damages for such
failure; but a fair construction of the contract imposed no such obligation

on

.

There is no pretence that R. did not deliver the whole amount of freight in
his possession, at the places designated in the contract. In this respect, as
well as in every, other, in regard to the contract, he seems to have acted in
good faith. And he was unable to deliver the number of barrels supposed,
either through the loss stated, or an erroneous estimate of the quantity.
But, to exonerate R. from damages on this ground, it is enough to know,
that he did not bind himself to deliver any specific amount of freight. The
probable amount is stated or supposed, in the agreement, but there is no
undertaking as to the quantity.

ERROR to the district court of the United States for the
western district of Pennsylvania.
In the district court for the western district of Pennsylvania,
the administrators of William Noble, the defenddinlts it) error,
instituted.an action of covenmt against the plaintiff in error
upon certain articles of agreement in the fbllowing terms.
"Article of agreement entered into this 24th day of February, between William Noble, of the city"of Cincinati, of the

SUPREME COURT.
[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.].

one part, and William Robinson, Jun., of the city of Pittsburgh,
of the other part, witnesseth: That the said Noble hereby
agrees, stipulates, and binds himself, to and with the said
Robinson, to transport and deliver to said Robinson, in the
steamboat Paragon, a certain quantity of subsistence stores for
the use of the United States army, supposed to amount to
three thousand seven hundred barrels, estimating one half of
the quantity of stores as flour barrels, and the other half as
whiskey or pork barrels; the said Robinson delivering the one
half of the same between the 1st and 10th March to said
Noble, at Cincinnati, and the other half by the 30th of March,
at the usual place of deposite, near the mouth of the Ohio; the
delivery of which stores is to be made and completed in the
order in which they are received at the town of St Louis aforesaid, on or before the 15th day of April next ensuing. In consideration whereof, the said Robinson hereby agrees and binds
himself to pay to the said Noble, one dollar and fifty cents per
barrel, one half whereof is to be paid on the delivery of said
stores at St Louis, inospecie funds, or their equivalent, and the
other half in Cincinnati, in the paper of banks current therein,
at the period of the delivery of the said stores at St Louis."
The declaration averred that in the month of March 1821,
he, the said Noble, received on board the steamboat Paragon
all the stores and lading which were offered by Robinson, both
at the city of Cincinnati, and the usual place of deposit near the
mouth of the Ohio river, and conveyed all the stores delivered
on board the said boaL according to the stipulations in the
articles of agreement, to the town of St Louis, and delivered
those to Robinson in peirson, and also avowed performance of
all the agreements, covenants and stipulations in the articles of agreement. The declaration then proceeds to assign
as bgeaches of the articles of agreement, that Robinson did not
deliver pne half of the said amount of thirty-seven hundred
barrels of army subsistence stores, dr. any oth'er equivalent
freight, to Noble, or on board tht said steamboat Paragon, at
Cincinnati, between the 1st and 10th of March in the year
1821, although Noble arid the boat were, during that time,
ready .and waiting to receive the same; and Robinson did- not,
on or before the 30th day of March ii the year last aforesaid,
nor afterwards deliver to Noble, at the usual place of deposite,

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.]

near the mouth of the Ohio river, the other half of the said
three thousand seven hundred barrels of army subsistence
stores, or on board of said boat at said last mentioned place,
although the boat was there ready and waiting to receive the
same, after the said 30th of March in the year last aforesaid;
and although Noble has frequently, before and after that time,
requested the said Robinson to furnish the stores and freight
stipulated for as aforesaid; and further, that Robinson hath
not paid to the said Noble, nor to his use, the said sun of one
dollar and fifty cents per barrel on the delivery of such amount
of said stores as were actually carried in said steamboat and
delivered in all respects, in accordance with the tenor of the
articles of agreement at St Louis, in specie or otherwise ; nor
hath Robinson paid to Noble, in any money,:by the barrel, according to the price stipulated as aforesaid or otherwise, for
such amount of said army subsistence stores'as Robinson was,
by the tenor of said articles of agreement, bound to furnish for
freights to St Louis, as above recited, but, on the contrary, hath
wholly refused to pay the amount stipulated by him to be paid
as aforesaid, in the manner or at the times above mentioned,
or at any other times, or in any other manner. And Robinson
hath further neglected and omitted to perform, in manner by
him ugreed as above mentioned, the stipulations and covenants
made as aforesaid, but the same hath broken and not kept,
contrary to the tenor and spirit of said articles of agreement,
whereby the said Noble not only was deprived of the amount
agreed to be paid by Robinson in manner aforesaid, but also of
other great gains and profit which might and would otherwise have arisen and accrued to him during the time of detenlion of steamboat, caused by the non-performance, by Robinson, of his agreements aforesaid.
On the trial of the cause, the counsel for the defendant
prayed the cpurt to charge the jury :
1. That it is an inflexible rule in the construction of contracts, so to interpret them as to effectuate the intention of the
parties. That it is within the province of the jury to determine
what the intention was at the time of the execution of the
instrument, according to the rules of construction the court
may advise.
2. That the contract upon which the present ction is

SUPREME COTRT'
(Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.I

instituted, is not a contract of affreightment by charter party.
There is no hiring of the ship. It is a contract for the conveyance of merchandise in a general ship. That the plaintiff
cannot recover damages according to the number of tons the
ship was capable-of containing; but that his damages must be
limited, according to the tems, of the contract, to the actual
freight earned upon the cargo delivered.
3. That the words, the spirit, and meaning of the contract
preclude the plaintiff from recovering from the defendant more
than .the actual value of the Miami Exporting Company paper
at the time it became due, according to the scale-of depreciation.
4. That, under this contract, there was no legal obligation
upon defendant to tender to plaintiff the amount due him in
the depreciated currency of the Miami Exporting Company,
in order to save himself from the payment of the numerical
value of the notes, inasmuch as the defendant reserved to himself the right either to pay in the depreciated currency, or in its
equivalent.
5. That the plaintiff cannot recover, in the present action at
law, the freight for goods actually transported, and damages
for the breach of the contract for non-delivery of all the stores
defendant contracted to deliver for transportation.
The court charged the jury upon these points :
1. It is certainly true that the intention of the parties to a
.contract must govern its construction, provided that no violence
is done to the rules of law in~seeking to effectuate such intention, and it is the province of the jury to judge, from the language of the contract, what thIat intention is, subject to the
opinion of the couit as. to its legal effect.
2. The contract which is the subject of the present suit, is
not a contract of affreightment by charter party ; and, in strictness, the plaintiff cannot recover damages according to the number of tons the boat was capable of containing. The rule of
law, in cases where there has been a failure to furnish the stipulated freight, and there exists no charter. party, is for the
jury to take all circumstances into consideration, and to make
an allowance for any freight which the master had it in his
power to transport in addition to that which was furnished.
If the ladingshould not be complete without the default of the

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Robingon v. Noble's Administrators.]

master, the rule is to estimate the freight by means of an
average, so as to take neither the greatest possible freight,
nor the least, and such average is the proper measure of damages.
3d and 4th. The actual specie value of the paper of the
Miami Exporting Compahy, at the time it became due by the
contract, is not the true measure of damages. It was made,
and to be executed in the state of Ohio, and the laws of that
state munst therefore govern this case. The defendant having
failed to tender to the plaintiff the paper of the Miami Exporting Company, or its equivalent, at the time mentioned in
the contract, and the plaintiff having performed all he had
covenanted to perform, is, by the laws of Ohio, entitled to
'recover the numerical value of the paper of the Miami Exporting Company, in specie, with interest.
In answer to the last point, the court said, that the plaintiffs
claim, not only for the -freight actually transported and delivered, but damages for failing to furnish as much freight as the
article stipulates for; if the testimony supports their claim, they
may, in the present action, recover damages for such failure.
Whereupon, the counsel for the defendant excepted to the
opinion of the court upon the several points aforesaid, and
requested the court to seal a bill of exceptions, which was accordingly done.
The jury rendered their verdict, finding in favour of the plaintiff the sum of three thousand three hundred and ninety-one
dollars and fourteen ceats; upon which verdict the court entered judgment; and th- defendant prosecuted this writ of
error.

.The case Was submitted to jhe court on printed arguments,
by Mr Watts, for the plaintiff in error' and by Mr Fetterman
and Mr Colwell, for the defendants.

From the face of this paper, as well as from evidence exVOL. Vill.-Y

SUPREME COURT.
[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators. ]

trinsic, it appears that Robinson was a contractor with Ahe
United States for the. supply of subsistence stores for their
troops stationed at a north west post on the Mississippi river;
and that Noble was a freighter, who navigated the rivers Ohio
and Mississippi in steam and flat boats.
As one half of the stores were to be delivered by Robinson for transportation at Cincinnati, and the other half at the
mouth of the Ohio-St Louis being the destination : there appear to be two subjects of contemplation presented to the mind
'of'said Robinson at the time he executed the agreement:
1. The usage prevailing between contractors of the United
States and the goverment ; the latter reserving the right to restrict the quantity of supplies, by giving to the:contractors a
reasonable notice of the same.
2. The loss arising from the perils'of the river, in navigating it, at that early day, either in steam or'keel boats.
Hence the caution observed by said Robinson in the introduction of the terms of his agreement. The stipulation is, on
the part of Noble, to carry subsistence stores, supposed to
amount to about 3,700 barrels, leaving the covenant, on the
part of Robinson, implied, rather than clearly expressed, to deliver any number of barrels for shipment; and that number
entirely contingent upon his interests, controlled, as they were
liable to be, by the United States, and the dangers of the
river.
The testimony of Richard Miller proves that one half of the
stores was delivered at Cincinnati, and the. reason why the
other half (two thirds or three-fourths being delivered) was not
ready at the mouth of the Ohio, was the loss of a flat boat
laden with them, and under the direction of Said Noble. Notwithstanding this misfortune of Robinson, it is seriously contended by the learned counsel of Noble, that, under the terms
of his agreement, Robinson will be obliged to pay for the freight
of goods that were sunk on their passage to the place of delivery, and never carried by Noble.
But the learned judge, in his charge to the jury, stretched
the point farther and-wider than the conscience of the counsel
would allow them to go. For, althought he admits there was
no " charter party," stil, he asserts the irreconcilable doctrine,

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Robinson v. Noblo's Administrators.]

that the rule of damages, where there has been an infraction
of the agreement, would. be to find an average number between
what was actually fdrhished and what the boat was capable of
containing; so that, if the capacity of the "Paragon" exceeded
6,000 barrels, the average number, according)to the charge of
the court, and which governed the jury, would be far beyond
even the 3,700 barrels. By referring to the account of Robinson, the court will see how far a blind chance has carried her
votaries beyond the limits of justice.
The second reason assigned. for the reversal of the judgment
arises out of the misconstruction of the court of that part of the
agreement relating to the payment of money.
It is proved by the deposition of Spencer, that the current
value of the bills of the Miami Exporting Company paper,
on the 1st April 1821, was sixty-six and two-thirds cents in
specie.
Cincinnati is about 800 miles from St Louis, and the mouth
of the Ohio not more than one-fourth the Aistance; hence the
stipulation, on the part of Robinson, to pay one dollar and fifty
cents per barrel for transportation from Cincinnati, and the
equivalent of one dollar and fifty cents in the depreciated currency, being one dollar, from the mouth of the Ohio to St
Louis.
This intention of the parties is the more apparent, by comparing the different clauses of the agreement. In the first,
Robinsbn contracts to pay in "specie funds ;" and in the
second, "in the paper of banks cdrrent at Cincinnati at the
period of delivery of said stores at St Louis ;" and, to put
the intention beyond controversy, it is further added, "it is
understood that the payment to be made in Cincinnati is to
be in the paper of the Miami Exporting Company, or its equivalent."
The term "equivalent," (being compounded of wquus and
valeo) both in its original and ordinary signification, means
what this depreciated currency was worth, equal in value ; and
cannot be restrained to what it is contended it is, to bank notes
of numerical value.
In the general derangement of currency of 1321, Mr Robinson clearly reserved the right to pay either in the paper of the,

SUPREME COURT.
[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.)

Miami Exporting Company, in other depreciated paper, or the
value of said Miami Exporting Company's paper in April 1821,
in specie.
The case relied upon by the learned judge who ruled this
cause will be found in Wilcox's edition of Ohio Repoirts, 87, 88
-Morris v. Edwards. And, although dissenting from the
opinion of Judge Hitchcock, and yielding to that of Judge
Burnet, it is considered that the opinion of Judge Hitchcock
is irreconcilable with that of the district judge in the present
cause.
It is based upon the principle that the amountof the indebtedness of the drawer of the note was liquidated and fixed at two
thousand dollars; and that, if it had been intended as a promise
to pay numerically, or the value of the currency, it ought, so
to have been expressed; arid the judge infers, from the absence of the expression, that it was not so intended. In
the case of Morris y. Edwards the evidence of depreciation was
excluded from the jury ; in this case, it was admitted without
objection.
Differing as that case does essentially from the present, the
attention of the court-is particularly invited to a review of it.
To sustain the positions that depreciated bills are not money,
not alegal tender, aad not negotiable, but a mere commodity,
the attention of the court is requested to the cases of M'Cormick v. Trotter, 10 Sergeant and Rawle 94; 8 Mass. 260 ; 9
Johns. 120 ; 3 Kent's Corn. 76 ; 1 Dallas 124; 2 Dallas 123,
173; 1 Bibb 461.
It is certainly clear that, when a man agrees to pay an ascertained sum of money, in commodities, as in the case in 1
Wash. C. C. R. 376, where there was an agreement to pay
seven thousand eight-hundred and twenty-eight livres in sugar,
or the bureau case in2 Perin. Rep. 65, and fails to tender the
commodities on the day they become due, that the debtor can
recover the amount in money, as in the first case, and the price
of the bureaus as in the second. But t', does not disturb the
inviolable principle. When there is a contract to pay in specific articles, the rule of construction is to estimate the damages
according to the value of the articles at the time of the infraction of the agreement. Vide 2 Mason 89 ; 3 Wheaton 200;

[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.]

6 Wheaton 109; 1 Peters's C. C. R. 85; 3 Cranch 298; 11
Sergeant and Rawle 445.
But, by the positive stipulation of the parties to the present
case, the paper of the Miami Exporting Company was ren-

dered a comm6dity, and Robinson agreed to pay in money, and
Noble to receive inmoney, what it was worth at a certain date
and all the circumstan-s of the transaction, the words and
construction.
spirit of the covenant, conduce to this
The learned judge therefore has erred in his charge to the
jury, upon the several points presented ; and injustice has been
done to the plaintiff in error.
Mr Fettevunan and Mr Colwell, for the defendant in error,
contended:
By the terms of the contract Robinson was bound to furnish
Noble, the owner and captain f Ihe steamboat Paragon, with
with about three thousand seven hundred barrels of freight to
be transported to St Louis ; one half to be furnished at Cincinnati, and the other half at the mouth of the Ohio, for the
transportation of which was to be paid the sum of one dollar
and fifty cents per barrel freight.
•It appeared in evidence that he furnished for the long voyage,
the full half ofthree thousand seven hundred barrels, and prevented Noble from taking other freight; but that for the short
and profitable voyage, he furnished not quite two-thirds of a
load. -And in the declaration it is averred as a breach of the
agreement on the part of Robinson, that he did not furnish the
stipulated number of barrels, freight. In consequence of which
Noble sought to recover damages.
It.is urged that, by the true effect of the agreement, Robinson is not so discharged, and that he was bound to furnish the
three thousand seven hundred barrels, subject only to such
deduction as may be reasonable under the qualification of
the terms connected with the number three thousand seven
hundred, keeping in view the circumstances of the case. It
is plain that the owner of a boat, entering into such a contract, would be governed in his arrangements, and in fixing
his terms, by the quantity of freight he was to carry. The
testimony shows that the amount agreed for, would make

SUPREME COURT.
[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.]

about two loads for the Paragon. The voyage was specially
undertaken for Robinson
and, doubtless, the rate of the
freight was regulated by its length, the time it would occupy,
and the amount to be furnished.
The boat might make
money by carrying two full loads at one dollar and fifty
cents per barrel, and lose money by carrying a load and a
half at the same price. When Robinson agreed to furnish
"stores supposed to amount to about three thousand seven
hundred barrels," how was he understood by Noble ? Did
either of them suppose that this stipulation would be fulfilled
by a delivery of three thousand one hundred ? Surely, these
qualifying terms have some reasonable limitation. When we
say about three thousand seven hundred, we surely mean more
than three thousand, else why descend to hundreds . Some
degree of certainty in hundreds above three thousand, is clearly
intended. Does not the common and plain intent of the lhfiaiguage show that the parties meant some number between three
thousand six hundred, and three thousand eight hundred .
As hundreds is the lowest denomination to which the parties
have descended, the range of the qualification must be kept
within one hundred of the number named. Here, then, is the
case of a plain agre'ment to furnish at least three thousand
six hundred barrels of freight, and to pay for the same as further agreed. It matters not, in the view of the defendant in
error, whether this is a case of a charter-party, or the case 6f
goods carried in a general ship ; the construction of the agreement must be the same either way. In relation to this point,
our claim arises in the failure of Robinson to furnish the freight
agreed upon, and is therefore a claim upon dead freight. The
agreement, when understood, constitutes the law of this case,
and there can be no rule in relation to charter-parties or
freight in general ships affecting its construction, or the rights
of the injured party, in reference to the question before the
court.
It is objected that the judge erred in laying down the riile
of damages on this point to the jury. It is believed that no
fairer, nor more honest rule can be found than the one adopted
by him, nor does it militate with any decision.

The owner of the Paragon is prevented taking more freight

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.]

by the conduct of Robinson, for the long voyage and the short
voyage, the owner of the Paragon performed his part of the
contiact. He transports a full load the long voyage, he gets
but half a load the short one, and that to him the voyage intended to be profitable.
The judge is correct in saying that Robinson, when there
'had been a failure on his part to furnish the amount of freight
stipulated, should pay for any freight that might have been
transported, and which was not transported, owing to his interference or default.

Can there be a fairer rule on this sub-

ject than the average one as laid down by the judge.
It is believed, that the rule recognized in Story's Abbot, last
edition, pages 197 to 200, and the cases there referred to, fully

establish the rule laid down by the learned judge to be the
law. See also Penoyer v. Hallet, 15 Johns. 332. It is also
presumed, that the same answer may be given to the fourth
assignment of error, which is nothing more than a consequence
from the first.

2d. It is assigned for error, that the court were wrong in
charging the jury, that Robinson having failed to tender to the
plaintiff the paper of the Miami Exporting Company or its
equivalent, at the time it was due, is obliged to pay the numerical value of the paper with interest.
It appears from the evidence, that at the time Robinson was
to have paid in paper of the Miami Exporting Company, or
its equivalent, such paper was considerably under par, and
that Noble was an indorser on, .and liable for a considerable
amount to the Miami Exporting Company. It would then
have suited him as well as cash. Robinson, however, does
not pay when the agreed time arrived, and never has paid,
even until this day. And now, after this great delay, he comes
forward, and asks to be released from a breach of his contract.
This is the case of a contract made in the state of Ohio, as
the money is to be pal4 at Cincinnati.

SUPREME COURT.
(Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.]

The contract, then, between these parties, must be governed
by the law of the state of Ohio on the subject; see Van
Reimsdyk v. Kane et al. 1 Gallison 371 ; Camfranque v. Burnell, I Wash. C. C. 340; Golden v. Prince, 3 Wash. C. C. 313;
Green v. Sarmiento, I Peters 74, 3 Wheat. Rep. 101 and 146;
Cox and Dick v. The United States, 6 Peters 172; Boyle v.
Zacharie and Turner, 6 Peters 635; which cases settle the
point.
It is apprehended then, that in Ohio the question has been
decided both at law and equity. The case of Edwards v.
Morris, 1 Ohio Reports 524, was a bill in chancery, filed by
the complainant, alleging, that at the time he contracted to
pay for certain land in current bank notes of the city of Cincinnati, his agreement was, as he supposed, only to pay in
paper of the Miami Exporting Company, which was thirtythree per cent under par, and praying for relief, &c., and
that he only may be compelled to pay the real value of that
paper. And the case appears, by. the report, to have been
fully agreed, ard the opinion delivered by judge Hitchcock,
who says,
The prayer of the bill, in this case is, to enjoin a judgment
at law, rendered at the lat term of this court, and also to
procure a rescision of a contract. Two reasons are assigned
why the court should -interfere.
1st. A mistake in the terms of the note upon which the
judgment was rendered.
2d. A doubt as to the title to the land conveyed by the defendant to the complainant, which land was the consideration
of the note.
The facts set forth in the bill, are admitted by the demurrer,
and the question to be determined is, whether there is sufficient
matter to justify the interference of a court of chancery.
It is the peculiar province of chancery, to relieve against

fraud, -mistake or accident. But how far parol testimony can
be admitted, to prove mistake in a written instrument, has been
matter of much altercation and doubt. Mistakes in matter of
fact, it seems, may be rectified; and the opinion of the court,
in the case of Hunt v. Rousmanier's administrators, 8 Wheat.
174, goes far to establish the doctrine,. that where parties,

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.]

through a mistake and ignorance of the law, execute a writing which does not carry into effect their contract and intention, the true contract and intention may be enforced in chancery.
In the case before the court, the alleged mistake consists in
this; the purchase money, which was the consideration for
which the note was given, was to have been paid in the notes
of the Miami Exporting Company.
The note was to have been made thus payable, whereas, in
fact, it was made payable in "cuirent bank notes of the city
of Cincinnati." The complainant understood, that he was to
pay in the numerical value of the notes. If, in consequence
of this mistake, the complainant has sustained an injury, he
ought to be relieved.
It is an invariable rule ii chauery, that he who seeks equity,
must do equity. Suppose the notes referred to had been drawn,
payable in the notes of the Miami Exporting Company, and
there had been no mistake, what must the complainant have
done to have defended himself at law, and to have secured to
himself the privilege of paying in the notes of that bank. He
must have tendered the notes on the day; and ought to have
them in court.
The mistake however happened, which rendered -it proper
that he should come into a court of chancery : what ought he
to do here ? The contract was, that he was to pay, on a particular day, the sum named in the obligation, in a particular
description of bank notes. He:ought then to show, that he
tendered these notes at the time specified, and he ought to bxing
them into coulrt, that the opposite party may receive them.
The notes, however, are not brought into court, nor is there
any pretence that they have been tendered. The complainant,
then, does not appear to be ready to do that equity which he
requires of the defendant., and on this ground is not entitled
to the relief piayed for.
The circumstance that the defendant, some time before the
promissory note fell due, stated that he would not receive those
bank notes in payment, cannot excuse the complainant in not
making the tender.
It is claimed, that an account should be taken of those
VOL. VIII.-Z

SUPREME COURT.
[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.]

notes, and that the complainant should only be made liable for
their specie value. This cannotbe done. Bank notes are
considered as money-the holder has a right to look to the
banks which iosue them for their numerical value in specie,
and cannot be lcompelled to take for them a value fixed, by
shavers and brIkers. The ability or inability of the bank to
pay, ought no to be taken into-consideration.
The demurrer is therefore sustained, the injunction dissolved,
and the bill dismissed with costs.
In the same book, page 178, in the case of Smith v. Goddard,
it is ruled at law, that a contract to pay in current bank notes,
is a contiact to pay in money, if the bank notes are not tendered at the day.
And also, in the beffre cited case of Morris v. Edwards, on
the law side of the court, reported in I Ohio Reports, commencing at page 189, the question is fully discussed, both by
the bar and the bench; and the question seems conclusively
settled. To that case, and to the reasoning of the judges
who delivered the opinion of the majority of the court, the
attention of this court is respectfully requested.
It is thought, that the principle ofthe Ohio cases, is sanctioied by a decision of judge Washington's, in the case of
Courtoir v. Carpentier, reported I Wash. C. C. 376. This
was an action on a note, given by defendant to plaintiff at Guadaloupe, both parties being French subjects, for the payment
of seven thousand eight hundred and twelve livres, in sugars,
at money value; it was proved that notes of this description
formed a species of circulating medium at Guadaloupe.
That according to the custom of the place, when payment
is demanded, or suit brought, three persons are appointed to

value the sugar, and determine what quantity should be delivered in payment of the note. That notes of this kind are
always in a state of depreciation, from twenty-five to forty per
cent, below cash. That when this note was given, it would
have been easier to pay three thousand dollars in sugar, than
one in cash. That they carried interest only from the time
judgment was rendered, or the note registered before a notary.

appealed, cannot give a judgment for sugar, the value in
money must be given, which, in effect, is the precise sum mentioned in the ote, but that no interest is to he allowed up to
the time of the judgment.
As to the term "about," and in the agreement it is obvious
that it means between three thousand six hundred and three
thousand eight hundred barrels-without straining, it cannot
be made, in this case, to mean less. it appears, thai the half
of three thousand seven hundred was a fair load for the boat,
and it is obvious, that the contract was made in special reference thereto.
It is believed, that. the cases to which the coutt are referred, will justify the district judge fully in his instruction on
all the points to the jury.
Mr Justice M'LEN, delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case was brought into this court, by a writ of error to
the distict court, which exercises the powers of a circuit court,
for the western district of Pennsylvania.
The plaintiffs in the district court, commenced an action
of covenant on the following instrumIent. "Article of agreement, entered into this 24th day of February, between
William Noble of the city of Cincinnati of the one part, and
William Robinson, Jun. of the city of Pittsburgh of the other
part, witnesseth that the said Noble hereby agrees, stipulates
and binds himself, to and with the said Robinson, to transport
and deliver to said Robinson, in the steamboat Paragon, a certain quantity of subsistence stores, for the use of the United
States army, supposed to amount to about thirty-seven hundred barrels, estimating one half of the quantity of stores as
flour barrels, and the other half as whiskey or pork barrels,
the said Robinson delivering one half of the same between the
1st and 10th of March to said Noble, at Cincinnati, and the
other half by the 30th of March, at the usual place of deposite, near the month of the 'Ohio; the delivery of which stores
is to be made and completed in the order in which they are
received, at the town of St Louis aforesaid, on or before the
15th day of April next ensuing. In consideration whereof,
the said Robinson hereby agrees and binds himself to pay to

SUPREME COURT.
[Robinson v. Noblc's Administrators.]

the said Noble, one dollar and fifty cents per barrel, one half
whereof is to be paid on the delivery of said stores at St Louis,
in specie funds or their equivalent, and the other half in Cincinnati, in the paper of banks current therein, at the period of
the delivery of said stores at St Louis. in testimony whereof,
the parties signed and sealed the instrumen t, the 24th of February 1821."

Under the agreement was the following memorandum. "It
is understood that the payment to be made in Cincinnati, is to
be in the paper of the Miami Exporting Company or its equivalent." Signed, William Robinson, Jun.
This covenant being before the jury, the defendant's counsel
prayed the court to instruct them, that the plaintiffs could only.
recover thG.stipulated price for the freight actually transported,
and that they were entitled to no mole than the specie value
of the notes of the Miami Exporting Company Bank, at the
time the payment should have been made at Cincinnati. But
the court-refused so to instruct the jury, and directed them that
they were authorised to take "all the circumstances into con-sideration, and to make an allowance for any freight which
the master had it in his power to transport, in addition to that
which was furnished. That if the lading should not be complete, without the default of the master, the rule is to estimate
the freight by means of an average, so as to take neither
the greatest possible freight, nor the least, and that such average is the proper measure of damages.
And the judge further instructed the jury, that "the defendant having failed to tender to ,the plaintiff the paper of the
Miami Exporting Company, or its equivalent, at the time mentioned in the contract, and the plaintiff having performed all
-he covenanted to perform, is by the laws of Ohio entitled to
recover the numerical value of the paper of the Miami Exporting Company in specie, with interest." And the jury, under
these instructions found for the plaintiff two thousand three
hundred and seventy-seven dollars and thirty-six cents in damages.
On this statement of the case, the question arises, whether
the court erred in refusing to give the instructions prayed foby the defendant. And first, whether the plaintiffs were enti-

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.]

tied to recover in damages more than the stipulated price for
the freight actually transported.
By the article, Noble agreed with Robinson to transport
"in the steamboat Paragon, a certain quantity of subsistence
stores, &c., supposed to amount to about thirty-seven hu'- ed
barrels," &c.; "in consideration whereof, Robinson binds himself to pay one dollar and fifty cents per barrel." Under this
agreement, only three thousand one hundred and five barrels
were delivered for transportation.
The plaintiff's counsel insist, that Robinson was bound by
his agreement to deliver the number of barrels specified, subject
only to a reasonable qualification of the words "supposed to
amount to thirty-seven hundred barrels ;" and that by this rule,
the number could not be reduced below thirty-six iundred
barrels.
It is clear, from the agreement, that the amount of freight
was not ascertained, and that Robinson did not covenant to
deliver any specific Inumber of barrels. It was conjectured,
there were thirty-seven hundred, and the payment for the
transportation was to be at the rate of one dollar and fifty cents
per barrel.
The master of the steamboat Paragon proved on the trial,
dint, the second trip which the boat made under this contract,
she had not more than two thirds or three fourths of a cargo.
And it also appeared, that the reason assigned why a greater
number of barrels were not delivered LO the master of the
steamboat was, that one or two flat-boats, laden with flour,
designed as a part of the second cargo of the Paragon were
sunk above Cincinnati.
If Robinson had bound himself to deliver a certain number
of barrels, and had failed to do so, Noble would have been entitled to damages for such failure ; but a fair construction of
the'contract imposed no such obligation on Robinson, and consequently, the breach assigned in the declaration is not within
the covenant.
It is unnecessary to determine, whether, under a certain
state of facts, and with proper averments in the declaration,
damages might not be recovered, beyond the price per barrel
for the cargo transported, as such a case is not, before the court.

SUPREME COURT.
[Robinson v. Noble's Administrators.]

There is no pretence that Robinson did not deliver the whole
amount of freight in his possession, at the places designated in
the contract. In this-respect, as well as in every other, in
regard to the contract, he seems to have acted in good faith.
And he was unable to deliver the number of barrels supposed,
either through the loss stated or an erroneous estimate of the
quantity. But, to exonerate Robinson from damages on this
ground, it is enough to know, that he did not bind himself to
deliver any specific amount of freight. The probable amount
is stated or supposed, in the agreement; but there is no under-'
taking as to the quantity.
When the circumstances under which this contract was
made are considered ; the contingencies on which the delivery
of the freight, in some degree depended: the reason is seen,
why cautious and indefinite 'language was used, in regard to
the number of barrels, in the contract. And the result proved
that this caution was judicious; as, if the contract had stipulated
for a specific amount of freight, Robinson would have been
bound to pay the full price of transportation, notwithstanding
the loss he sustained.
The court think that there was no breach of the covenant,
in this respect, on the part of Robinson, and that the district
court erred in not giving the instruction, as prayed for by the
defendant.
The second instruction asked by the defendant's counsel in
the court beJow was, that the plaintiffs were hot entitled to recover more than the specie value of the notes, in which the
payment was to have been made, at Cincinnati.
It was proved, on the trial, that the notes of the Miami Exporting Company, in which, by the contract, the payment was
to be made or other notes of equal value, were not worth more
in specie, than sixty-six and two thirds per cent.
The express provisions of the contract show, that the payment at Cincinnati was not to have been made- in specie, or
what was equivalent to specie. The notes of the Miami Exporting company were substituted by the parties, as the standard of value, which should discharge this part of the contract,
and the payment of those notes, or any others of equal value,
was all that Noble had a right to demand. But, it is contend-

JANUARY TERM, 1834.
[Robinson v.Noble's Administrators.]

ed, that as the payment was not made at the day, it must needs
be made in specie, and to the full amount of the sum agreed
to be paid in depreciated paper.
In what does this covenant to pay differ from an agreement
to deliver a certain quantity of flour, or any other commodity,
on a given day.
The notes of the Miami Exporting Company purported to
be money, and may, to some extent at the time, have circulated as such in business transactions: but it is manifest, they
were not considered as money by the parties to this contract ;
but as a commodity, the value of which was to be ascertained
by the amount of specie it would bring in the market. And
if it should not be convenient for Robinson tolnake the payment in theso notes, he was permitted to mak. it, by the contract, in any other depreciated notes of equal value.
Robinson failed to make the payment at the time, and is
he now bound to pay the nominal amount of these notes in
specie? What damage has Noble sustained by the non-payment? Certainly not more than the value of the notes, if
they had been paid.
Had these notes been equal to specie on the day of payment,
Robinson was bound to pay them, or what'was of equal value.
If they had depreciated to fifty cents in the dollar, Noble was
bound to receive them, in discharge of the covenant. Each
party incurred a risk. in the fluctuations of the value of the
notes specified; and nothing could be more unjust, or more
opposed to the spirit and letter of the contract, than to require
Robinson to pay in specie, the nominal value of these notes.
The law affixes no such penalty for default of payment. Robinson can only be held liable to make good the damages sustained through his default; arid the specie value of the notes,
at the time they should have been paid, is the rule by which
such damages are to be estimated.
In this view, it appears that the district court erred in refusing to give the second instruction prayed for by the defendant's counsel; on this ground, therefore, as well as the one
first noticed, the judgment of that court must be reversed, and
the cause remanded for further proceedings, in conformity with
this decision.
