JANUARY Â°TERM 1834,

THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES,

PLAINTIFF IN ERROR V.

DEFENDANT IN ERROR.

Action of debt brought by the Bank of the United States upon a promissory
note made in the state of Kentucky, dated the 25th of June- 1822, whereby,
sixty days after date, Campbell, Vaught & Co. as principals, and David
Campbell, Steeles, and Donnally the defendant, as sureties, promised to pay,
jointly and severally, to the order of the president, directors and company
of the Bank of the United States, twelve thousand eight hundred and
seventy-seven dollars, negotiable and payable at the office of discount and
deposit'of the said bank at 'Louisville, Kentucky, value received, with
interest thereon, at the rate of six per centum -per annum thereafter, if
not paid at maturity. The declaration contained five counts. The fourth
count stated, that the principal and sureties " made their other note in
writing," &c., and thereby promised, &c. (following the language of
the note), and then proceeded to aver "that the said note in writing,
so as aforesaid made, at, &c., was, and is a writing without seal, stipulating for the payment of money; and that the same, by the law of Kentucky, entitled an act, &c. (reciting the title and annexing the enacting
clause), is placed upon the same footing with sealed writings, containing the same stipulations, receiving the same consideration in all courts
of justice, and, to all intents and purposes, having the same force and
effect as a writing under'seal ;" and then concluded with the usual assignment of the breach, by non-payment of the note. The fifth count differed
from the fourth principally in alleging, "that the principals and sureties,
by their certain writing obligatory, duly executed by them without a seal;
bearing date, &c., and here shown to the court, did promise, &c.;" and
contained a like averment with the fourth, of the force and effect of such
an instrument by the laws of Kentucky. The defendant -demurred generally to the fourth and fifth counts ; and the district court sustained the
demurrers.
By the court: We are of opinion that the fourth and fifth counts are, upon
general demurrer, good'; and that the judgment o' the court below, as to
them, was erroneous. They set out a good and sufficient cause of action,
in due form of law ; and the averment that the contract was made in Kentucky, and that, by the laws of that state, it has the force and effect of a
sealed instrument, does not vitiate the general structure of those counts,
founding a right of action on the note set forth thereon. At most, they
are surplusage ; and if they do not add to, they do not impair the legal liability of the defendant, as asserted in the other parts of those counts.
According to the laws of Virginia, the defendant had a right to plead as many
several matters, whether of law or fact, as he should deem necessary for his
defence, and he pled " nil debet" to the three first counts of the declaration, on which issue was joined. The defendant also pleaded the statutes
of limitation of Virginia to the other counts. The court held the plea of the
atatute of limitations a good bar to all the counts, and gave judgment in favour
VOL. ViI.-2 v

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]
of the defendant. The statute of limitations of Virginia, provides that all
actions of debt, grounded upon any lending or contract, without specialty,
shall be commenced and sued within five years., next after the cause of such
action or such suit, and not after. The act of Kentucky of the 4th of February 1812, provides, "that all writings hereafter executed without a seal
or seals, stipklating for the payment of money or property, or for the performance of any act, duty or duties, shall be placed upon the same footing
with sealed writings, containing the like stipulations, receiving the same
consideration in all courts of justice, and to all intents and purposes having
the same force and. effect, and upon which the same species of action may
be founded, as if sealed."
Held, that the statute of limitations of Virginia, precluded the plaintiff's recovery in the court- where the action was instituted; the statute pleaded,
the statute of Kentucky, not being available in Virginia.
As the contract, upon which the 'original suit Was brought, was made in Ken.
tucky, and is sought to be enforced in the state of Virginia, the decision of
the case in favour of the defendant, upon the plea of the statute of limita.
tions, will operate as a bar to a subsequent suit in the same state; but not
necessarily as an extinguishment of the contract elsewhere, and especially
in Kentucky.
The general principle adopted by civilized nations is, that the nature, validity
and interpretation of contracts, are to be governed by the laws of the country
where the contracts are made, or are to be performed. But the remedies
are to be governed by the laws of the country where the suit is brought;
or, as it is compendiously expressed, by the lex fori. No one will pretend,
that because an action of covenant will lie in Kentucky, on an unsealed
contract made in that state, therefore, a like action will lie in another.state,
where covenant can be brought only on a contract under seal.
It is an appropriate part of the remedy which every state prescribes to its own
tribunals, in the same manner in wbich it prescribes the times within w~hich
all suits must be brought. The nature, validity and interprctation of the
contract, may be admitted to be the same in other states; but the mode by
which the remedy is to. be pursued, and the time within which it is to be
brought, may essentially differ. The remedy, in Virginia, must be sought
within the time, and in the mode, and according to the descriptive characters
of the instrument, known to the laws of Virginia.; and not by the description and characters of it, presented in another state.
An instrument may be negotiable in one state, which yet may be incapable
of negotiability by the laws of another state; and the remedy must be in
the courts of the latter on such instrument, according to its own laws.

IN error to the district court of the United States for the western district ol Virginia
The plaintiffs in error instituted an action of debt in the district court of the western district of Virginia, to November
term 1829, against the defendant, he 'being the only party to
the instrument sued upon, who was found within the jurisdiction of the court.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]

'The declaration contained five counts upon -the following
note executed by the defendant and several others:
June 26th, 1832. $12,877. Sixty days after date, we,
Campbell, Vaught & Co., as principals, and David Campbell,
and Steele, Donnally & Steeles, as sureties, do promise to
pay, jbintly and severally, to the order of the president, directors, and company of the Bank of the United States, without
defalcation, twelve thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven
dollars, negotiable and payable at the office of discount and
deposit of the said bank, at Louisville, Kentucky, value received, with interest thereon at the rate of six per centum per
annum thereafter, if not paid at maturity.
CAMPBELL, VAUGHT & CO.
DAVID CAMPBELL.
STEELE, DdNNALLY & STEELES.

The first, second and third counts in the declaration set out
the note as a simple contract debt, to which the defendant
pleaded "nil debet," and the statute of limitations of Virginia;
and the plaintiff filed replications, to which the defendant demurred. Judgment in favour of the defendant was entered
by the court on these three counts.
The third and fourth counts were as follows:
"And wherdas also the said Andrew Donnally and Richard
Steele, William Steele, Robert M. Steele, and Adam Steele,
partners trading under the firm of Steele, Donnally & Steeles,
heretofore, to wit, on the 26th day of June 1822, and in the
life time of said Adam Steele, Robert Steele, and William
Steele, since deceased, at Louisville, in the state of Kentucky,
to wit, at the district aforesaid, with one David Campbell, and
the firm of Campbell, Vaught & Co., made their other note in
writing; which said note, signed by the said firm of Steele,
Donnally & Steeles, and dated the day and year aforesaid, is
to the court here shown, and thereby promised jointly and severally, the said Campbell, Vaught & Co. as principals, and
the said David Campbell and the said Steele, Donnally &
Steeles, as sureties, sixty days after the date thereof, to pay to
the order of the president, directors, and company of the Bank of
the United States, without defalcation, the sum of twelve thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven dollars, negotiable and
payable at the office of discount and deposit of said bank at.

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]

Louisville, Kentucky, value received, with interest thereon at
the rate of six per centum per annum thereafter, if-not paid at
maturity. And plaintiffs aver that said note in writing, so as
aforesaid made at Louisville in the state of Kentucky, and payable at said place, was and is a writing without seal, stipulating
for, the payment of money ; and that the same, by the law of
Kentucky, entitled "an act to amend the law of proceedings
in civil cases, approved February 4th 1812," (an extract from
which said law, duly authenticated under the seal of the said
state of Kentucky, and duly certified, is to the- court here
shown) is placed upon the same footing with sealed writings
containing the like stipulations, receiving the same consideration in all courts of justice, and to all intents and purposes
having the same force and effect as a writing -under seal.
And-although said sum of money, in said last mentioned note
specified, has long been due and payable, according to the
terms of said note, yet the said Andrew Donnally, Richard
Steele, Robert M. Steele, Adam Steele, and William Steele, in
the life time of said Robert M., Adam, and William Steele,
and the said Donnally and Richard Steele, since the death of
said Robert M., William, and Adam Steele, have not, nor
has either of then-m nor has the said David Campbell, or the
said firm of Campbell, Vaught & Co.,. or either of them, paid
unto said plaintiffs said last mentioned sum of twelve thousand
eight hundred and seventy-seven dollars, or any part thereof,
but to pay the same, or any part thereof, to said plaintiff, the
said firm of Steele, Donnally & Steeles in the life of the said
deceased partners, and the said David Campbell, and Campbell, Vaught & Co, refused, and the said defendant and Richard Steele, surviving partners of the late firm'of Steele, Donnally & Steeles, still refuse. By reason whereof in action
bath accrued to said plaintiffs to demand and have of and from
said defendant said last mentioned sum of twelve thousand
eight hundred and seventy-seven dollars, other parcel of said
sum of money above demanded.
"And for that whereas afterwards, to wit, on the 26th day
of June in the year 1822, at Louisville, in the state of Kentucky,to wit, at Clarksburg, inthis district, the aforesaid Campbell, Vaught & Co. -as principals, and the aforesaid David
Campbell and Richard Steele, Andrew Donnally, Adam Steele,

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]

Robert M. Steele and William Steele, as securities, the said
Richard, Andrew, Adam, Robeit, and William, acting under
the firm nd style of Steele, Donnally & Steeles, by their certain
writing obligatory, duly executed by them, without a seal,
bearing date the same day, and here shown to the court, did
promise and bind themselves, jointly and severally, to pay the
plaintiffs, without defalcation, another sum of twelve thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven dollars, negotiable and
payable at the office of discount and deposit of the said plain,
tiffs, at the aforesaid town of Louisville, in Kentucky, with ihterest thereon at the rate of six per centum per annum thereafter, if not paid at maturity. And the said plaintiffs in fact
say that, though the said last mentioned sum of money, when
due and payable according to the tenor and effect of said writing, to wit, on the 28th.day of August 1822, at the office of
discount and deposite aforesaid, was duly demanded, the same
was not paid by the said Campbell, Vaught & Co., David
Campbell, and "Steele, Donnally &' Steeles, or by any or either
of them, nor have the said Campbell, Vaught & Co., David
Campbell, and Steele, Donnally & Steeles, or any or either
of them, at any time paid the same, or any part thereof, but
the same to pay, they, and each of them, though often requested, have altogether failed, and refused, and still do refuse;
and the said plaintiffs further in fact say that the said writing
was duly made and payable at the aforesaid town of Louisville,
a placewithin the commonwealth of Kentucky, and subject
to laws thereof; and that the same writing, executed without a
sea], was, at the time of its execution, and ever has been, and
is now, by the laws of the said'commonwealth of Kentucky, then
and still in force, upon the same footing with a sealed instrument containing like stipulations, entitled to the same consideration in all courts of justice, and having, to all intents and
purposes, the same force and effect as it.would if sealed. By
reason thereof, the plaintiffs are entitled to demand and recover
of the said Andrew Donnally, one of the said obligors in the
said writing, the aforesaid sum of twelve thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven dollars, with interest as aforesaid, other
parcel of the debt above demanded."
To the fourth and fifth counts demurrers were filed by the
defendant,, and there was a joinder in demurrer. The district

SUPREME COURT.
IBank of the United States v. Donnally.]

court gave judgment in favour of the demurrers. The defendant also pleaded to these counts "nil debet" and the
statute of limitations of Virginia. The plaintiffs demurred to
the plea of the statute of limitations of Virginia, and to the
plea of nil debet on the fourth count, and joined issue on the
plea of nil debet.

The statute of limitations of Kentucky, referred to in the
fourth and fifth counts, was passed February 4, 1812, and is
as follows :
"An act to amend the law of proceedings in civil cases.
Approved, Feb. 4, 1812.
"Sec. 8. Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,
that all writings hereafter executed ,ithout a seal or seals,
stipulating for the payment of money or property, or for the
performance of any act, duty or duties, shall be placed upon
the same footing with sealed writings containing the like stipulations, receiving the same consideration, in all courts of justice, and to all intents and purposes having the same force and
effect, and upon which the same species of action may be found
as if sealed."
The district court held the plea of the statute of limitations
of Virginia a bar to all the counts, and gave judgment on all
the demurrers for the defendant, with the general conclusion
that the plaintiffs take nothing by their bill, &c.
The plaintiffs prosecuted the writ of error.
The case was argued by Mr Haidin and Mr Sergeant, for
the plaintiff in error; and by Mr Ewing and Mr Binney, for
the defendant.
By Mr Hardin, for the plaintiff in error, it was argued,
that the whole of the case depends upon the question, can the
statute of limitations of Virginia be pleaded to the note sued
on, referred to in the fourth and fifth counts. The statute
of Virginia only applies to simple contract debts, and not.. to
debts secured by specialty; and the only question to be decided
is, Is the writing a specialty or not?
To enable the court correctly to settle this point, further
facts in 'the cause are to be considered. The note was executed at, and made payable in, Louisville, in the state of Ken-

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]

tucky. The place where a note is made payable, forms a part
of the contract; 4 Littell's Reports 226. A note not under
seal, is made a specialty in Kentucky: 4 Littell's Laws of
Kentucky 305; and also by the decisions of the court of appeals of Kentucky, 2 Marshall 568, and 3 Marshall 284, In
those cases it is expressly decided that, since that statute of
Kentucky a note executed in that state, not under 9sal, is a
specialty to all intents and purposes. 4 Griffith's Law Register 1135, 6th, note 1. The law of the place where the
contract is made. is to form a part of the contract: 2 Bibb
208.
It is admitted that the lex fori is to govern as to the remedy.
That the statute of limitations o! Virginia is the statute to be
pleaded, and not that of Kentucky, is also admitted; but still,
it is equally clear that the statute of Virginia does not apply
to a specialty; that the note sued on was a specialty in the
state where it was executed and made payable, is certain,
because the same is. so enacted by the legislature, in '1811,
which statute has remained in full force ever since, and was
so expounded by the court of appeals of that state. Whatever forms a part of the contract, remains so, and cannot
be altered or changed by a mere change of place as to the
remedy sought. This principle is frequently illustrated by
the incident of interest, which is always regulated by the
place where the contract is made and made payable, and not
the place where it is attempted to be enforced.
For the defendant, it was contended, that the demurrers
will be sustained, if the instrument in the declaration is not a
specialty. The note is not a specialty in-its form, and whatever effect the act of Kentucky may have upon it in that state,
it does not operate in the same manner elsewhere. That act
does not declare the instrument a specialty; which is a writing obligatory without a seal. But the plea of nil debet is
itself an admission that it is not a writing obligatory. Nil
debet cannot be pleaded to su~h a writing; the proper plea
to a writing obligatory is non est factum.
The action is brought in Virginia, and the statute of limitations of that state, and not that of the state of Kentucky,
applies.

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]

In Virginia, it is a simple contract debt, and it is even so in
Kentucky; although, by the law of 1812, in the courts of
justice of that state, "it has, to all intents and purposes, the
same effect as sealed instruments." It is not made, by this
law, a sealed instrument; and when a recovery is sought out
of the jurisdiction of the court of Kentucky, the law of the
remedy must be the law of the place where the suit has been
instituted.
The law of Kentucky addresses itself to the courts of that
state only. There the instrument has all the effects of a specialty, importing consideration, having priority, &c.
The cases cited by the counsel of the plaintiffs in error, prove
no more, than that Lhe courts of Kentucky follow the law of
that state. These cases can have no influence on the question,
whether a court in Virginia is to follow the law of Virginia, or
that of Kentucky. Cited: Story's Conflict of Laws 219, 222;
3 Johns. Rep. 267; 1 Johns. Rep. 140; 2 Mass. Rep. 80;
5 Johns. Rep. 239; 14 Johns. Rep. 340; 4 Cowen 608; 1 H
Black. 135; 3 Price 250; 7 Cranch 481, 2 Cond. Rep. 578;
Jones v. Hook's Adm., 2 Rand. 303; 2 Vesey 540.
Mr Sergeant, in reply, urged upon the court the propriety
of leaving to the plaintiffs in error their remedy on the note,
should a suit be brought upon it in the state of Kentucky, or
elsewhere. Ifthe court should consider the limitation law of
Virginia as governing the case, they would apply that law,
by their judgment, to the remedy which had been sought by
this suit in Virginia, and not give such a judgment as would
impair the plaintiffs' right elsewhere.
Upon the questions in the case, Mr Sergeant cited, 5 Johns;
239; 3 Gill and John. 245; Story's Conflict of Laws 475. He
contended, that the sole ground of the cases cited for the defendapt, was the effect of the statute of limitations upon the
remedy. They do not decide that the right to the debt is
destroyed by the lapse of time.
Mr Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a writ of error to the district court for the western
district of Virginia.
The original suit was an action of debt brought by the Bank

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]

of the United States upon a promissory note dated the 26th of
June 1822, whereby, sixty days after date, Campbell, Vaught
& Co. as principals, and David Campbell, and Steele, Donnally
(the defendant) and Steeles, as sureties, promised to pay, jointly
and severally, to the order of the president, directors and company of the Bank of the United States, twelve thousand eight
hundred and seventy-seven dollars, negotiable and payable at
the office of discount and deposit of the said bank at Louisville,
Kentucky, value received, with interest thereon, at the rate of six
per centum per annum thereafter, if 4ot paid at maturity. The
declaration contained five counts, upon the three first of which
it is unnecessary to say any thing, as the judgment thereon is
not now in controversy. The fourth count stated, that the
principal and sureties "made their other note in writing," &c.,
and thereby promised, &c. (following the language of the
note), and then proceeded to aver "that the said note in
writing, so as aforesaid made, at, &c., was, and is a writing
without seal, stipulating for the payment of money; and that
the same by the law of Kentucky entitled an act, &c.,
(reciting the title and annexing the enacting clause) is placed
upon the same footing with sealed writings, containing the
same stipulations, receiving the same consideration in all
courts of justice, and to all intents and purposes having
the same force and effect as a writing under seal;" and
then concluded with the usual assignment of the breach, by
non-payment of the note. The fifth count differed from the
fourth,- principally, in alleging that "the principals and sureties
by their certain writing obligatory, duly executed by them
without a seal, bearing date, &c., and here shown to the court,
did promise, &c.;" and contained a like averment with the
fourth, of the force and effect of such an instrument by the'
laws of Kentucky. The defendant having a right, according
to the laws of Virginia, to plead as many several matters,
whether of law or fact, as he should deem necessary for his defence, pleaded nil debet to the three first counts ofthe declaration (on which issue was joined) and the statute of limitations
of Virginia to the same counts; to which there was a special
replication, and a demurrer to that replication and joinder in
&emurrer. To the fourth and fifth counts the defendant deYmurred generally, and there was a joinder in demurrer. He
VOL. vIII.-2w

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]

also pleaded to the same counts nil debet and the statute of
limitations of Virginia. The plaintiffs demurred to the plea
of the statute of limitations, to these latter counts, and also to
the plea of nil debet to the fourth count, and joined issue on
the plea of nil debet to the fifth count. The court held the
plea of the statute of limitations a good bar to all the counts,
and accordingly gave judgment upon all the demurrers in
favour of the defendant; with the general conclusion, that
the plaintiffs take nothing by their bill. The present writ of
error is brought to revise this judgment.
As the contract, upon which the original suit was brought,
was made itz Kentucky, and is sought to be enforced in the
state of Virginia, the decision of the case in favour of the
defendant, upon the plea of the statute- of limitations, will
operate as a bar to a subsequent suit in the same state; but
not necessarily as an extinguishment of the contract elsewhere,
and especially in Kentucky. But a general judgment in
favour of the defendant, upon his demurrer to the declaration,
(it is supposed) may, as a judgment upon the merits of the
claim, have a very different operation, as a res judicata or final
judgment. Hence there arises a very important consideration,
as to the correctness of the judgment upon that demurrer. It
has accordingly been argued at large, by the counsel for the
bank, as vital to the rights, as well as to the remedies of the
bank in other states. We are of opinion, that the fourth and
fifth counts are, upon general demurrer, good ; and that the
judgment of the court below, as to them, was erroneous.
They set out a good and sufficient cause, of action, in due
form of law,and the averments, that the contract was made in
Kentucky, and that, by the laws of that state, it has the force
and effect of a sealed instrument, do not vitiate the general
structure of those counts, founding a right. of action on the
note set forth thereon.. At most, they are but surplusage; and
if they do not add to, they do not impair the legal liability of
the defendant, as asserted in tle other parts of those counts.
The other point, growing out of the statute of limitations,
pleaded to the fourth and fifth counts (for as to' the thiree first
counts it is conceded to be a good bar) involves questions of a
very different character, as to the operation and effect of a
conflict of laws in cases governed by the lex loci. The statute

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]

of limitations of Virginia provides, that "all actions of debt,
grounded upon any-lending or contract without specialty,"
shall be commenced and sued within five years next after the
cause of such action or suit, and'not after. This being the
language of the act, and confessedly governing the remedy in
the courts of Virginia, the bar of five years must apply to all
cases of contract, which are without specialty, or, in other
words, are not founded on some instrument acknowledged as
a specialty by the law of that state. The common law being
adopted in Virginia, and the word "specialty" being a term of
art of that law, we are led to the consideration, Whether the
present note is deemed, in the common law, to be a specialty.
And certainly it is not so deemed. It is not a sealed contract,
nor does it fall under.any other description of instruments or
contracts or acts known in the common law as specialties.
The argument does -lot deny this conclusion; but it endeavours to escape from its force, by affirming, that the note is a
specialty according to the laws of Kentucky; and if so, that
this constitutes a part of its nature and obligation; and it
ought, every where else, upon principles of international jurisprudence, to be deemed of the like validity and effect.
The act of Kentucky of the 4th of February 1812 provides,
"that all writings hereafter executed without a seal or seals,
stipulating for the payment of money or poperty, or for the
performance of any act, duty or duties, shall be placed upon
the same footing with sealed writings, containing the like stipulations, receiving the same considerationLin all courts of justice, and to all intents and purposes, having the same force
and effect, and upon which the same species of action may be
founded, as if sealed." Now, it is observable, that this statute dces not in terms declare, that such writings shall be
deemed specialties; nor does it say, that they shall be deemed
sealed instruments. All that it affirms is, that they shall be
put upon the same footing as sealed instruments, and have the
same consideration, force, effect and remedy as sealed instruments. So that it is perfectly consistent with the whole
scope and object of the act, to give them the same dignity and
obligation as specialties, without intending to make them such.
A state legislature may certainly provide, that the same remedy
shall be had in a promissory note, as on a bond or sealed in-

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]

strument ; but it will not thereby make the note a bond or
sealed instrument.
It may declare that its obligation and
force shall be the same as if it were sealed ; but that will still
leave it an unsealed contract. (a)
But whatever may be the legislation of a state, as to the
obligation or remedy on contracts, its acts can have no binding
authority beyond its own territorial jurisdiction. Whatever
authority they have in other states, depends upon principles of
international comity, and a sense ofjustice. The general principle adopted by civilized nations is, that the nature, validity
and interpretation of contracts, are to be governed by the law of
the country where the contracts are made, or are to be performed. But the remedies are to be governed by the laws of
the country where the suit is brought; or, as it is compendiously expressed, by the lex fori. No one will pretend, that
because an action of covenant will lie in Kentucky, on an unsealed contract made in that state; therefore, a like action will
lie in another state, where covenant can be brought only on a
contract under seal. It is an appropriate part of the remedy,
which every state prescribes to its own tribunals, in the same
manner in which it prescribes the times within which all suits
must be brought. The nature, validity and interpretation of
the contract may be admitted to be the same in both states ;
but the mode by which the remedy is to be pursued, and the
time within which it is to be brought, may essentially differ.
The remedy, in Virginia, must be sought within the time, and
in the mode, and according to the descriptive characters of the
instrument, known to the laws of Virginia, and not by the description and characters of it, prescribed in another state. An
instrument may be negotiable in one state, which yet may be
incapable of negotiability by the laws of another state; and
the remedy must be in the courts of the latter on such instrument, according to its own laws.
If, then, it were admitted, that the promissory note now in
controversy, were a specialty by the laws of Kentucky, still
it would not help the case, unless it were also a specialty, and
recognised as such, by the laws of Virginia ; for the laws of the
(a) See 4 Griffith's Law Register 1136, note; cases in Kentucky on
this point, 1 Marsh. Rep. 507.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Bank of the-United States v. Donnally.]

latter must govern as to the limitation of suits in its own courts,
and as to the interpretation of the meaning of the words used
in its own statutes.
It may be added, that neither the fourth count., nor the fifth
count of this declaration, aver the note to be a specialty ; nor
does either assert it to be a sealed writing; but the contrary:
so that the court are called upon to make an intendment as to
the operation of a foreign law, which, if essential to the case,
should have been directly stated, and not left to mere inference.
The case, however, is not without authority, even if it were
not clear upon principle. In Warren v. Lynch, 5 Johns. R.
239, where a promissory note was made in Virginia, payable in
New York, and the maker signed it with a scrawl, which, in
Virginia, is deemed to be a seal ; on a suit in New York, it was
held to be an unsealed instrument (the laws of New York recognising no instrument as sealed, unless such as are with a
wax or wafer seal), and, therefore, that the proper form of action was assumpsit, and not debt. In Andrews v. Herriot, 4
Cowen 508, it was held, that an action of covenant will not lie
in New York, on a contract to be performed in Pennsylvania,
where there was a scrawl instead of a seal in the locus sigilli;
although, by the law of Pennsylvania, a scrawl is deemed a
seal. In Trasher V. Everhart, S Gill and Johns. R. 234, it
was held, that in case of a single bill made in Virginia (where
it is not deemed a specialty), sued in Maryland, an action of
assumpsit is not maintainable as upon a simple contract, but
must be debt; because, in Maryland, such single bill is deemed
a specialty. The doctrine of these cases seems directly in
point; and a very close analogy may be found in the case of
Jones v. Hook's Administrator, 2 Randolph 303, where the
court of appeals of Virginia held, in an action of debt, upon a
judgment of North Carolina, brought in Virginia, that the statute of limitations of North Carolina was no bar, but that of
Virginia, if applicable, governed the remedy.
Upon the whole, our opinion is, that the judgment upon the
demurrer by the defendant, to the fourth and fifth counts,
ought to be reversed ; and that in all other respects, it ought
to be affirmed. But, as the plea of the statute of limitations
is a good bar to all the counts,-the judgment of the court below,:

SUPREME COURT.
[Bank of the United States v. Donnally.]

that the plaintiffs take nothing by their writ, is right, and
ought to be affirmed with costs.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of tL,e
record from the district court of the United States for the western district of Virginia, and was argued by counsel ; on consideration .whereof, it is considered by the court here, that the
judgment of the district court of the western district of Virginia
is erroneous in this, that upon the demurrerof the said Donnally,
to the said fourth and fifth counts in the said declaration, the
judgment ought not to have been as is set forth in the recoid,
but ought to have been, that the fourth and fifth counts afoicsaid are good and sufficient in law, to have and maintain the
action aforesaid, of the plaintiffs aforesaid, for the matters contained therein ; and it is further considered by the court here,
that the special pleas pleaded by the said Donnally, of the
statute of limitations, to the first, second and third counts of
the said declaration, are good and sufficient in law, to preclude
the said plaintiffs from havirig and maintaining their action
aforesaid thereon, notwithstanding the matters set up by the
said plaintiffs, in their replication to the said special pleas ; and
it is further considered by the court here, that the special plea3
pleaded by the said Donnally, to the said fourth and fifth
counts of the declaration aforesaid, of the statute of limitations,
and also of nil debet to the said fifth count, are good and sufficient in law, to preclude the said plaintiffs from having and
maintaining their action aforesaid, against the said Donnally.
And, therefore, inasmuch as it appears to the court here, that,
upon the whole record, the pleas aforesaid, so as aforesaid
pleaded by the said Donnally, and adjudged in his favour are,
in law, a good and sufficient bar to the action aforesaid, upon
all the counts contained in the declaration aforesaid, notwithstanding the fourth and fifth counts thereof are otherwise good
and sufficient in law : it is therefore considered by the court
here, that the judgment aforesaid of the district court of the
western district of Virginia, that the-said plaintiffs take nothing
by their bill aforesaid, be, and the same is hereby, for this cause,
affirmed witli s .
