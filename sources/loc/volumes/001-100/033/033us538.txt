GRAF AND DELPLAT HER OWNERS, APPELLEES.

Bottomry. On an appeal from the decree of the circuit court of Maryland,
on a libel on a bottornry bond, originally filed in the district court, it appeared that commissioners appointed by the circuit court, had reported,
that a certain sum, being a part of the amount of the bond, was absolutely
necessary for the ship, as expenses and repairs in the commo n course of
her employment. No exception was taken to this report by either party in
the circuit court, and it was accordingly confirmed by that court. The
report is not open for revision in this court, there being nothing on its face
impeaching its correctness.
It is no objection to a bottomry bend, that it was taken for a larger amount
than that which could be properly the subject of such a loan; for a bottomry
bond may be good in part and bad in part; and it will be upheld by courts
of admiralty, as a lien to the extent to which it is valid ; as such courts, in
the exercise of their jurisdiction, are not governed by the strict rules of the
common law, but act upon enlarged principles of equity.
It is notorious, that in foreign countries, supplies and advances for repairs and
necessary expenditures of the ship, constitute, by the general maritime
law, a valid lien on the ship ; a lien which might be enforced in rem in our
courts of admiralty, even if the bottomry bond were, as it certainly is not,
void in tote.
An objection was taken to the bond, that the supplies and advances might
have been obtained on the personal credit of the owners of the ship without
an hypothecation. Held, that the necessity of the supplies and advances
being once made out, it is incumbent upon the owners, who assert that they
could have been obtained upon their personal credit, to establish that fact
by competent proofs ; unless it is apparent from the circumstances of the
case.
It was objected, that the supplies and repairs were, in the first instance, made
on the personal credit of the master of the ship, and therefore cotuld not be
afterwards made a lien on the ship. Held, that the lender on the bottomry
bond might well trust the credit of the master as auxiliary to his security ; and
the fact that the master ordered the supplies and repairs before the bottomry
was given, can have no legal effect to defeat the security, if they were ordered by the master, upon the faith, and with the intention that a bottomry
bond should be ultimately given to secure the payment of them. In cases
of this sort, the bottomry bond is in practice ordinarily given after the whole
supplies and repairs have been furnished ; for the plain reason that the advances required can rarely be ascertained with exactness until that period.
It was objected, that the advances were for a voyage not authorized by the

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[The Virgin.]
owners ; that the original orders were for the master to get a freight for Bal.
timore or New York, and if he could not, then to proceed to New Orleans;
whereas the master broke up his voyage, and without any freight returned to
Baltimore. By the Court: It may be admitted, that if a bottomry lender, in
fraud ofthe owners, and by connivance withthe master for improper purposes,
advances his money on a new voyage, not authorized by the instructions.of
the owner, his bottomry bond may be sot aside as invalid. But there is no
pretence to say, that if the r ster does deviate from his instructions, without
any participation or co-operation or fraudulent intent'of the bottomry lender,
the latter is to lose his security for his advances, bona fide made for the
relief of the ship's necessities.
Seamen have a lien, prior to that of the holder of a bottomry bond, for their
wages; but the owners are also personally liable for such wages; and if the
bottomry holder is compelled to discharge that lien, he has a resulting right
to compensation over, against the owners; in the same manner as he would
have, if they had previously mortgaged the ship.
Graf, one of-the owners, had the ship delivered up to him upon an appraisement, at the value of eighteen hundred dollars, and he gave a stipulation
according to the course of admiralty proceedings, to refund that value,
together with damages, interest and costs, to the court, lie is not at liberty now to insist that the ship is of less than that value in his hands, or
that he has discharged other liens diminishing the value for which the o.vners were personally liable, in solido, in the first instance.
To the extent then, of the appraised value of the ship delivered upon the
stipulation, the owners are clearly liable; for she was pledged for the
redemption of the debt, and they cannot take the fund, except cum onere.
But beyond this, there is no personal obligation upon the owners.
In this case, the value of the ship, the only'fund out of which payment can be
made, fell far 9hort of a full payment of the amount due upon the bottomry
bond. But this is the misfortune of the lender, and not the fault of the
owners. They are not to be made personally responsible for the act of the
master because the fund has turned Out to be inadequate ; since, by our
law,he had no authority by a bottomry, bond to pledge the ship, and also
the personal responsibility of the owners. The consequence is, that the
-loss, ultra the amount of the fund pledged, must be born by the libellant.

APPEALS from the circuit court%of the United States for the
district of Maryland.
The ship Virgin sailed in August 1822, from. Baltimore to
Amsterdam, where she arrived on the 12th of October of that
year, under command of John Cunnyngham. By the plan
of the voyage, she was to return from Amsterdam to Baltimore if she could procure a freight; otherwise, she was positively directed to proceed to New Orleans. She was owned,
when she sailed, by John C. Delplat, who, during her passage
to Amsterdam, became insolvent, and on the 4th of September
sold one-third of her to Frederick C. Graf.

SUPREME COURT.
LThe Virgin.]

The vessel, on her way to Amsterdam, encountered severe
weather, and arrived there in want of sails and a cable, and of
various repairs. At her departure from Baltimore, her owner
directed, that at Amsterdam, as the most economical place for
the supply, she should be furnished with a mainsail and topsail
and cable, of which it was foreseen she would then be in urgent
need. The -vessel had a cargo, of which, except twenty hogsheads of tobacco, all belonged to Delplat; and all of the cargo
was consigned to N. and I. and R. Vanstaphorst, at Amsterdam, to whom Delplat also consigned the vessel. The twenty
hogsheads of tobacco belonged to Frederick C. Graf. Agreeably to these consignments, the captain, on arrival at Armsterdam, delivered to the Vanstaphorsts the cargo, and committed
to them all the concerns of the vessel; in consequence of which
they collected and held in their hands all the freight that was
actually payable upon any portion of the cargo, and all the
proceeds of the tobacco belonging to Mr Graf.
The captain, desiring to refit the vessel and afford her all
the necessaries for her return voyage, applied to the Vanstaphorsts for the requisite means, and ultimately even offered them
a boitomry of the ship for the funds. After much delay, they
refused all advances; intelligence of the failure of Delplat,
asserted by them to be largely their debtor, having meanwhile
reached them. To provide for the event of this refusal, the
captain set on foot a negotiation through brokers, for raising
the means by bottomry ;-and the application to the Vanstaphorsts, and this provisional negotiation, were pending for about
three weeks,-the captain knowing no friends of the owner,
except the Vanstaphorsts, to whom he could apply for the aid.
During this period, the captain contracted, on his own respoasibility, for various supplies, which he designates in his evidence, as all those that were furnished before the 1st of November. The payment for these and for the other necessaries of
the ship, was made out of the moneys received from the
appellee Vyfhius. On the 12th of November, after the Vanstaphorsts had finally declined making the advances, the captain contracted with Vyfhius for the loan upon bottomry of
eight thousand guilders, at an interest of ten per cent; all
which, he shows, was appropriated for the indispensable uses of
the ship.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[The Virgin.]

About the 3d of November, the captain received from Mr
Graf, a letter dated in September 1822, announbing his purchase of one-third of the Virgin, and referring to a certificate
of his purchase, as enclosed in the letter; which in fact appears
not to have been enclosed. - About the same time, by another
lette'r from Mr Graf, and perhaps also from other quarters,
information was given to the captain of Mr Delplat's failure;
and, in consequence, the captain, on consultation, determined
that it was his duty to proceed with the vessel home to Baltimore, and not to despatch her to New Orleans. After undergoing repairs,and receiving all her supplies paid for by the
appellee Vyfhius, the Virgin sailed from Amsterdam to Baltimore, and arrived there in March 1823.
The owners refusing to pay the appellee his advances, the
libel in this cause was filed, which prays citation against the
owners by name as well as the captain, and condemnation of
the vessel for paying the loanr, and also further relief such as
the court may deem adequate and just. The owners, Delplat
and Graf, appeared and answered; their answers called into
question the fact and the -necessity Qf expenses at Amsterdam,
insisting too, that the Vanstaphorsts had property enough of
the owners, and which should have been applied for the wants
of the ship, and charging that the bottomry was really taken
by the Vanstaphorsts though colourably in Vyfhius's name, and
maintaining, finally, that all requisite funds could have been
raised op the credit of the owners, or of the captain
A commission for evidence wa- sent to Holland, the chief
object of which was to prove the Vanstaphorsts to be really the
owners of the bottomy. The circuit court determined that the
bottomry was invalid, but that the owners are personally liable
for all the necessary supplies furnished by the means of Vyfhius for the vessel, and that, to that extent, he was entitled
in this cause, to recover against them. The cause was then
referred to the clerk of the court to ascertain, calling to his aid
two merchants, the amount of the necessary supplies, referred
to. The clerk and his ssistants reported their ascertainment.
Exceptions by Delplat and Graf were filed to it. The case
was remanded to the clerk, who called two other merchant, to
co-operate with him, and they reported their statement of the

SUPREME COURT.
[The Virgin.]

necessary expenses, which the court confirmed. Thereupon,
the court passed its final decree, awarding payment to Vyfhius
by Delplat and Graf, of the sum of two thousand nine hundred dollars, with interest from the 26th of November 1830,
the date of the decree ; the principal of the ascertained expenses being two thousand nine hundred dollars.
Both parties appealed to ihis court.
The case was argued by Mr Steuart, for the owners of the
ship Virgin; and by Mr Mayer, for Mr Vyfhius.
For the owners of the Virgin, it was contended that the
decree of the circuit court which made them personally liable
for the claim of the libellant Vyfhius, was erroneous:
1. Where it is attempted to pursue the owner of a ship personally, for advances for which he may be made personally
liable, the proper remedy (in the admiralty court) is by libel in
personam, or at all events, the personal liability must be distinctly averred and charged in the libel.
2. When the proceeding is altogether in rem (f6r example
against a ship on a bottomry bond), it presents no question but
the validity of the hypothecation. The court is restricted to
that question, and cannot decree in personam.
3. The circuit court acting in its appellate character, could
do no more than the district court, that is to say affirm or reverse the decree of the district court (which- simply held the
bottomry good, on a libel exclusively in rem); and having by
its interlocutory order of 1828, pronounced the bottormry invalid and thereby reversed the decree of the inferior court, it
had no right to go farther and decree in personam against the
owners.
4. Although owners, when pursued personally in an admiralty court, may be held personally liable for advances for the
necessary repairs and supplies of their ships expressly made on
the personal oredit of the owners, or whe'e it is fairly inferred
that the personMl credit was looked to; yet when it appears the
personal credit of the owners was not looked to, they cannot
be held personally liable.
5. There is no evidence that the advances were made on the

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[The Virgin.]

credit of Delplat and Graf or either of them, but the contrary
is alleged by libellant himself, and appears in all the proofs.
6. Some of the supplies for which the advances are alleged
to have been made, were not necessary and have been impro,
perly charged and- allowed, as appears in the report and exceptions.
7. Part owners of a ship are not liable beyond the extent of
their respective interests, and the decree is erroneous in subjecting Graf to more than one-third, and Delplat to more than twothirds, in which proportions they held the ship.
:8. Evidence appeas sufficient to warrant the belief ihat
Vanstaphorsts were the real lknders of the money advatnced to
-the captain, and .yfhius only an agent of theirs. If so, they
(Vansiaphorsts) cannot recover against the owners personally;
because they had sufficient funds in the freight, which they
were bound to apply to -the uses of the ship.
9. Admitting, (which is not proved) that the Vanstaphorsts
had a right to withhold Delplat's two-thirds of the freight on
the ground of his indebtedness to them,-they had no right
to withhold from Graf, as they have done, his one-third of the
freight, amounting to one thousand nine hundred dollars, and
they cannot now recover from him, personally, without accounting for that sum.
10. The evidence raises a strong presumption that Vanstaphorsts knew, and also that Vyfhius knew (or might and ought
to have known), that the voyage to Baltimore was in direct
violation of the orders of the owners, without any necessity
for such violation by the captain; and if so, Vyfhius is not entitled to recover against the owners, whether he be considered
the real lender, or only as the agent of Vanstaphorsts.
11. All the evidence in the case taken together, raises a
strong presumption, that there were fraud and collusion between
Vyfhius and Vanst-aphors ts, not to apply the freight or other
funds of Graf, in Vanstaphorsts' hands to the uses of the ship,
but to subject her unnetessarily to a bottomry, and her owners
to loss; wherefore neither Vyfhius nor Vanstaphorsts are entitled
to recover against the owners.
Mr Steuart argued, that the original advances by Vyfhius
were illegal, as there was no survey showing the necessity for

the repairs, and the outfit of the Virgin. To show that this
was necessary, he cited, Abbot on Shipping 124, note 2, last
edition ; 1 Wheat. 96,,3 Cond. Rep. 501. He contended, that
the disbursements were paid for on the personal responsibility
of the captain, as the evidence showed they were made before
the bottomry was executed. The freight was an ample fund
for the repairs and disbursements, and was properly applicable
to pay for the same. Abbot 107, 114 ; Marshall on Insurance
741 ; 1 Wheat. 96, 3 Cond. Rep. 501.
The money was advanced by Mr Vyfhius to fit out the Virgin
for a voyage in direct opposition to the orders of the owners.She was to proceed to New Orleans, if no freight could be obtained to Baltimore; yet she returned to Baltimore subjected to
the heavy claims of Mr Vyfhius, and without any freight.
Advances are only legal when they are made to effectuate the
proper voyage of the vessel. Abbot on Shipping 124; 1 Wheat

Vanstaphorsts, and they could not as consignees become creditors by a bottomry contract. Bee's Rep. 339, 344; Abbot 126,

Mr Mayer, for the libellants, Vyfhius & Co., contended for
the following positions.

2. Where a bottomry is declared ineffectual, the person who
has supplied the necessaries for the ship for which-the bottomry

[Tho Virgin.)

is given, is remitted to his original right in personam, against
the owners, who are bound for all supplies to the ship; which is
also impliedly hypothecated for them. In-personnji, the libellant here waives marine interest, and claims only principal and
legal interest. To that extent the bottomry binds personally,
where the res is, after the bottomry, accepted. This personal
liability exists, whether the bottomry be good or unavailing.
Bee's Adn. R. 252; 2 Peters's Adm. 295; 2 Brown's Adm. 407;
Emer. Mar. Laws 101, 104. The penal o~ligation atleast goes
to the value of the res. I Hag. 13, 14. Or at all events, the
lender, as to it, is only involved in any equities that may subsistbetween master and owners, when the supplies are furnished
to the master, Emerig. p. 82, so as so far to limit the personal
responsibility ; and the lender is then substituted for the captain's lien for supplies, which is here conceded to him. The
accepted definition of bottomry, implies a personal responsibility
of the owners, for at least principal and legal interest, under
the bottoniry itself. The only aspect in which the remedy is
exclusively in ren under a bottomry bond, is as to the marine
interest. .2 Bi. Com. 457, 458 ; I Paine's C. C. R. 671 ; I

The question of personal liability under a bottomry, is only
a point of jurisdiction. And in England only, a court of equity
can give the relief personally under thc limited scope there of
the admiralty remedies. 6 Mad. 11, 79 ; 2 Lord Raym. 931,

The claim for personal liability need not be under the bond,

general responsibility of the owners for supplies to their ship,
or against the owners as holders of the res. 3 T. R. 340;
1 Gall. 75 ; 5 Peters 675. In all cases in admiralty, in iem,

personam improper. 3 Dall. 54.
It is maintained that the relief in personam may be decreed
for principal and legal interest, althnugh the bottomry bond be
good in rem. The bottomry is good here, although taken
where there were consignees of the vessel, and even admitting
that they had funds ; those funds being denied to the master
if they existed. Although the master may have purchased
the supplies, the lenders of -the money to pay for them did not
advance their means upon his personal credit. And if the
advances had not been made, the vessel might, in the foreign
port, have been proceeded against. Abbot 125, 126 ; I Wash.
C. C. R. 52; I Dodson 276, 288, 464; 2 Dodson 147; 1
Hag. 13, 176, 326; 1 Wheat. 96: The lenders were not
bound to see to the application of the money; nor implicated
in any degree on account of the captain's violation of his instructions as to the voyage to be pursued. Abbot 126 ; Bee's
Adm. R. 362, 363; 2 Dall. 194 ; 1 Dodson 465 ; 3 Wash. C.
C. R. 495, 497. The payments for duties and port charges
were proper to be secured by bottomry, 2 Caines's R. 77; 1
Hag. 176.
If the record be considered as presenting the question whether the seamen's wages are to be deducted from the bottomry,
it is contended, that the owners being personally liable for
them, they cannot make them a charge against the bottomry
interest ; the bottomry holder would be substituted for the seamen against the owners, if they (the bottomry holders) had paid
the wages. Cited also, The Langdon Cheves, 2 Mason 58.
Mr Steuart, in reply.
It is contended on the part of the libellant, that the bottomry
bond is good, so far as it covers advances strictly within the law
of nmaritime loans ; and for the iesidue, recourse must be had.
in personam. To show what circumstances are necessary to
make a valid bottomry, he cited, The Aurora, 1 Wheat. Rep.
96 ; 2 Peters's Adm. Decisions 301, 302, 303 ; Abbot 125.
There, is no precedent of a decree in the admiralty in personam, except The Fair American, 2 Peters's Adm. Rep. ;
and this was a case in the circuit court. The allegations in
the libel in this case are not sufficient to maintain a claim in

SUPREME COURT
[The Virgin.]

personam. The prayer for general relief is not enough for
this purpose. The relief by a decree in personam is-not consistent with the case made by the bill ; and is not therefore
within the rules of chancery proceedings.
If the claims- of the libellant are in personam, he has his
remedy at common law ; and the admiralty wi!l not convert
a claim, originally against the ship, into one of a common law
character exclusively. Cited, also, 2 Hag. 48, 66; 2 Peters's Adm. Rep. 295 ; Bee's Adm. Rep. 254; 1 Peters's Adm.

Mr Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is the case of a libel in rem, upon a bottomry bond,
originally institutcd in the district court of the district of Maryland, and thence brought by appeal to the circuit court, and
thence by appeal to this court. The ship Virgin belonged to
Baltimore, and being in Amsterdam, in the kingdom of Holland, in November 1822, bond was there given to the libellant
by the master, for the sum of three thousand two hundred
dollars, and maritime interest at the rate lof ten per cent, for
advances asserted tQ be made by the libellant to supply the
necessities of the ship on a voyage from Amsterdam to Baltimore. The voyage was duly performed; and the bottomry
loan not being paid by the owners, proceedings were duly
commenced for the recovery thereof, and the suit has been
protracted to the present period. The owners interposed a
claim and defensive allegation, denying the validity of the
bond: and at the hearing in the district court, a decree was
entered, affirming its validity, and awarding to the libellants
the full amount of the bottomry bond, with interest at the rate
of six per cent from the filing of the libel. The circuit court,
on the appeal, reversed this decree, pronounced the bottomry
bond invalid, and then proceeded to entertain the suit in personam against the owners ; holding them liable for the necessary supplies and repairs of the ship, in the same manner as
if the suit had been originally commenced in personam against
the owners. And after some interlocutory proceedings, the
circuit court awarded a final decree against the owners, for
the sum of two thousand nine hundred dollars, being the
amount ascertained by a report of commissioners, as "expen-

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[Tho Virgin.]

ditures and advances absolutely necessary, and made in the
course of the usual employment of the ship," with interest
from the time of the decree, until the payment of the amount
thereof. From this decree both. parties have appealed to this
court, and the cause now stands upon the argument for a final
decision.
The first question is, whether the bottomry bond was valid
in its origin, and constituted a good lien on the ship. Several
objections have been taken to its validity. In tile first place,
it is said, that the bottomry bond, though taken in the name
of the libellant, Vyfhius, was, in fact, taken in trust, and for
the benefit of Vanstaphorst and company, who were the consignees of the ship and cargo, and had. ample funds of the
owners in their hands to meet the necessary expenditures, if
any were necessary; and therefore, they cannot now subject
the ship to a:bottomry lien; But we do not think that this
objection is sustained as matter of fact by the evidence in the
case. The only testimony to support it is a loose statement of
Schiimelpennick, one of the partners of the house of Vanstaphorst and company ; who stated to a witness, "that the
expenses of the Virgin had amounted to about eight thousand
guilders, and that they would not be so foolish as to make
such an expense for Delplat, without securing themselves by
a bottomry." This language is quite equivocal, and admits of
different interpretations; and it does not appear upon what
occasion, or under what circumstances it was used. It may
mean, that they had declined to make the advanccs without a
bottomry bond, without meaning to affirm, that one had been
actually taken for their benefit. But, what is most important
in the case, this declaration cannot be competent evidence
against Vyfhius; who is not shown to have had any knowledge
of it, or to have been in. privity with Schimnielpennick; so
that, as to him, it is the mere hearsay of a third person. And
on the other hand, the master of the Virgin expressly disclaims
tny knowledge, that any of the advance's were made by Vanstaphorst and company, and affirms that they were made by
Vyfhius, at his reqwtest, through the instrumentality of a broker. We may then dismiss all further consideration of this
objection, since Ilie botlomry bond i- not traced home to Vanstaphonst and company.

[The Virgin.]

The next objectibn is, that the advances were not necessary for the supplies and repairs of the ship. This objection is not now fairly open upon the record. The second
and last report of the commissioners expressly finds, that
the stun of two thousand pine hundred dollars of the advances was absolutely necessary for the ship, as expenses and
repairs in the common course of her employment. No exception was taken to this report by either parly, and it was
accordingly confirmed hy (he circuit court; so that it is not
now open for review in this court, there not being any thing
on its face impeaching its correctness. It is true, that the
bottomry bond was taken for a larger amount; but that furnishes no ground of objecti6n to the bond, except for the
surplus; for a bottomry bond may be good in part, and bad
in part; and it will be upheld by courts of admiralty, as
a lien to the extent to which it is valid ; as such courts, in the
exercise of their jurisdiction, are not governed by the strict
rdes of the common law, but act upon enlarged principles of
equity. There are many authorities to this effect; but it is
only necessary to cite the cases of The Augusta, I Dodson's R.
283; The Tartar and the Nelson, I Hag. Adm. R. -169, 176.
And, indeed, except so far as regards the maritime interest of ten
per cent, the question would be unimportant; for it is notorious,
that in foreign countries, supplies and advances for repairs and
necessary expenditures of the ship, constitute, by the general
maritime law, a valid lien on the ship; a lien which might
be enforced in rein in our courts of admiralty, even if the bottotary bond were, as it certainly is not, void in toto.
The next objection is, that the supplies and advances might
have been obtained upon the personal credit of the owners, without .an hypothecation. Now, the necessity of the supplies and
advances being once made out, it is incumbent upon th6 owners, who assert that they could have been obtained upon their
personal credit,, to establish that fact by competent proofs,
unless it is apparent from the circumstances of the case. Now,
not only is there no proof to this effect upon the record, but it
is fairly repelled by the testimony of the master, as well as by
the other circumstances of the case. When the ship sailed on
her voyage from Baltimore for Amsterdam, she was exclusively
owned by Delplat; and she, as well as her cargo, a great part

JAN JARY TERM 1834.
(The Virgin]

of which was also owned by Delplat, was consigned to Vanstaphorst and company. Delplat failed during the voyage;
and about that time assigned one third of the ship to Graf,
and the other two thirds to other persons. The cargo, on the'
ship's arrival, was delivered, pursuant to the consignment, to
Vanstaphorst and company, and certainly could not be rightfully, with.held from them under the bills of lading. Delplat,
after deducting all his consignments, remained in debt to Vanstaphorst and company, in about nineteen thousand guilders.
And after they were apprised of Delplat's failure, and after a
negotiation of some weeks between them and the master for
advances, they declined to make any'to him; and he was
thus compelled to obtain them elsewhere.
It is wholly imnaterial in this case, whether Vanstaphorst
and company had funds in their possession, which ought to have.
been advanced by them for the relief of the ship. - It is sufficient
to justify the master, that he could not obtain them; and the
nonexistence of funds, and the non ability to get at them, must,
as to the master, be deemed to be precisely equal predicaments
of distress.. It would not be very. easy to convince any lender
of money, that he could safely trust to the personal security
of an insolvent debtor; and although Graf was not involved
in the failure of Delplat,.-yet his title was acquired on the eve
of Delplat's failure, and did not appear on the ship's papers, so
that a cautious lender might well hesitate as to the ability of
the master to bind Graf; even if it had appeared, which it
does not, that Graf's credit was so unquestionable: at Amsterdam, that his personal security, given by an acknowledged
agent, would have been satisfactory. But the truth is, that
the master's testimony negatives any other adequate means of
supplying the ship's necessities without resort to a bottomry
bond; and there is not the least reason to suppose that he did
not act with entire good faith, and from a consciousness that
funds could not otherwise be obtained. It is certainly incumbent on the owners, if they assert that such means existed, to
give some solid proofs in support of their assertion.
Then, again, it is objected that the supplies and repairs
were in the first instance maple upon the master's credit. But
how were they made? There is not a tittle of proof that the
material men originally trusted to his personal credit exolu-%.

[The Virgin.)

sively, waiving the licu which the foreign law would give on
the ship for them, or the general responsibility of the owners.
On the contrary, they might well trust to his credit, as auxiliary to tliese sources: and the fact that the master ordered
the supplies and repairs before the bottomry bond was given,
can have no legal effect to defeat that security, if they were
so ordered by the master, upon the faith and with the intention
that a bottomry bond should ultimately be given to secure the
payment of them.
In truth, in cases of this sort, the bottomry bond is in
practice ordinarily given after the whole supplies and repairs
have been furnished, for the plain reason that the advances
required can rarely be ascertained with exactness until that
period.
In a case before loxd Stowell,(a) an objection of
a similar nature was taken, viz, that the advances were made
before the bottomry bond was taken; but that learned judge
overruled it, and said that it was sufficient that it was the
understanding of the parties at the time that the money
should be secured by means of bottomry; and that it was of
no consequence whether the money was advanced at once,
and the bond immediately entered into, or whether the master
received it from time to time in different sums, and gave a bond
for the whole amount. And he added, what is very significant under the circumstances of the present case, that the
party who lent the money, had a right, by the maritime law,
to detain the ship and cargo until the debt was repaid; and it
was only by the meafis of the bond, that the owners had the
benefit of the liberation of their property.
In the next place, it is objected that the advances were for
,a voyage not authorized by the owners: that the original
orders were for the master to get a freight for Baltimore or
New York, and if he could not, then to proceed to New Orleans ; whereas the mdster broke up his voyage and without
any freight returned to Baltimore. Now , it may be admitted,
that if a bottomry lender, in fraud of the owners, and by connivance. with the master for improper purposes, advances his
money on a new voyage, not authorized by the instructions of
the owner, his bottomry bond may be set aside as invalid.
(a) La Ysabel, I Dodson's Rep. 273, 276.

JANUARY TERM 1834.
[The Virgin.]

But there is no pretence to say that if the master does deviate
from his instructions, without any participation or co-operation
or fraudulent intent of the bottomry lender, the latter is to lose
his security for his advances, bona fide made for the relief of
tihe ship's necessities. In the present case there is no proof
that Vyfhius ever saw the master's instructions ; much less,
that he fraudulently co-operated with him in a wilful disobedience of the orders of the owner. A new and unexpected
state of things had arisen. The owner had failed, and new
owners had been substituted, with some of whom he had not
had any communication. Under these circumstances he.applied for advice to the friends of his former owners, and they
advised him to return home ; as not only prudent and proper,
but as required by the change of ownership. His own judgment coincided with theirs; and there is no ground to assert
that he did not act with entire good faith, and that under all
the circumstances, the course adopted by him was not discreet
and fit for such an emergency. To set aside a bottomry bond
given under such circumstances, would be to impair in no
small degree the general confidence of the commercial community in their security; and would overturn the great maritime policy upon which they have been hitherto held sacred
and pivileged liens.
We have thus considered the principal objections urged
against the bottomry bond, and are of opinion that they are
unmaintainable. The consequence is, that the bond must be
upheld to the extent of the property pledged for the security of
it. It has been said that the seamen have a prior lien on the
ship for their wages, and that the amount of the wages ought
first to be deducted. Undoubtedly the seamen have such prior
lien, but the owners are also personally liable for such wages;
and if the bottomry holder is compelled to discharge that lien,
he has a resulting right to compensation over against the
owners, in the same manner as he would have if they had
previously mortgaged the ship.
But in strictness, no such question arises on the present
record. Graf, one of the owners, has had the ship delivered
up to him upon an appraisement, at the value of eighteen
hundred dollars ; and he has given a stipulation according to
the course of admiralty proceedings, to refund that value, to,

SUPREME COURT.
[The Virgin.]

gether with damages, interest and costs, to the court. He is
hot at liberty now to insist that the ship is of less than that
value in his hands; or that he has discharged other liens
diminishing the value for which the owners were personally

liable, in solido, in the first instance.
To, the extent, then, of the appraised value of the ship,
delivered upon the stipulation, the owners ae clearly liable-;
for she was pledged for the redemption of the debt, and they
cannot take the fund, except cum. onere. But beyond this
there is no personal obligation upon the owners. It has been
correctly remarked by lord Stowell,(a) that the form of bottomry bonds is different in different countries; and so is their
authority. In some countiies they bind the owners; in others
not; and where they do not, even though the terms of the
bond should affect to bind the owners, that part would be insignificant; but it would not at all touch upon the efficiency
of those parts, which have an acknowledged operation. In
England. and America the established doctrine is,.that the
owners are not personally bound- except to the extent of the
fund pledged which has come into their hands.(b) To this
extent, indeed, they may correctly be said to be personally
bound; for they cannot subtract the fund, and refuse to apply
it to discharge the debt. But in that case the proceeding
against them is rather in the character of possessors of the
thing pledged, than strictly as owners. In the plesent case,
the value of the ship, the only fund out of which payment can
be made, falls far short of a full payment of the amount due
upon the bottomry bond. -But this is the misfortune of the
lender, and not the fault of the owners. They are- not to be
made personally responsible for the act of the master, because
the fund has turned out to be inadequate; since, by our law,
he had no authority by a bottomry bond to pledge the ship,
and also the personal responsibility of the owners. The consequence is, that the loss, ultra the amount of the fund pledged,
must be borne by the libellant.
But as the owners have had the full benefit of the bond
under the appraisement and delivery during this protracted

controversy, it is.but reasonable that they should be responsible
for interest upon the appraised value, from the time when the
delivery upon the appraisement took place.
The view which has been thus taken of the present case,
renders it wholly unnecessary to consider whether a decree in
personam could be made by the circuit court upon a libel and
proceedings instituted in rein. That and the other questions
respecting the exercise of the admiralty powers of the court,
may well be left for decision when they shall constitute the
very points in judgment.
The decree of the circuit court must be reversed; and a
decree will be entered conformable to the opinion of this court,
to be carried into effect by that court.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the circuit court of the United States for the district of Maryland, and was argued by counsel; on consideration
whereof, it is declared by this court, that the bottomry bond
in the case stated is, and ought to be held valid for the sum of
two thousand and nine hundred dollars, being the amount
ascertained by the second and last report of the commissioners
to be due to the libellant for expenditures and advances absolutely necessary, and made in the course of the usual em'ployment of the said ship Virgin,'and also for the additional sum
of teri per cent, the maritime interest agrecd on, and payable
by the terms of the said bottomry bond, amounting, in the
whole, to the -sum of three thousand one hundred and ninety
dollars, and that the said libellant is entitled to the said last
mentioned sum, with interest thereon, at the rate of six per
cent, from the commencement of the present suit to the time
when the decree of this court shall be carried into effect by
the circuit court. And it is hereby ordered, adjudged and
decreed by this court accordingly. And it is hereby further
ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the decrees of the district
and circuit courts, so far as they differ- from this present decree
be, and. hereby are, reversed accordingly. And this 'court,
further proceeding to render such decree as the circuit court
ought to have rendered in the premises, it is further ordered,
adjudged and decreed, that the said claimant, Graf, do forth-

[The Virgin.]

with pay into the said circuit court the sum of eighteen htiwdred dollars, being the amount of the appraised value of the
said ship Virgin, delivered to him on stipulation as in the proceedings mentioned, together with interest thereon, at the
rate of six per cent, from the 24th day of March 1824, when
the same was delivered to him on stipulation as aforesaid, unto
the day when the same sum shall be so paid into the circuit
court, together with the costs of the district and circuit courts;
and unless he shall do so within ten days after the said circuit
court shall require the same to be done, that execution do
issue in due form of law upon the stipulation aforesaid, against
all the parties thereto. And upon the payment of such sums,
then that the claimants, as owners of the said ship Virgin,
be, and hereby are for ever exonerated from all other and
further payment in the premises. And it is further ordered,
adjudged and decreed, that this cause be remanded to the said
circuit court., with directions to carry this decree forthwith
into effect.
