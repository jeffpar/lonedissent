APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the District of Wisconsin.
On the night of the 22d of June, 1866, the steam propeller
Cleveland, in rounding Bar Point,* at the head of Lake Erie,
on her way up the lake to Detroit, made the lights of a tug
and tow, descending the Detroit River near its mouth into
the lake, at the supposed distance of two miles. They
proved to be the lights of the tug McClellan, having in tow
the bark Maria Martin, bound down the lake.
At the time when the lights were made by the lookout
of the propeller, this last named vessel had just obtained her
offing from Bar Point and was put upon her course for Bois
Blanc light,t north by east. Her course had been west by
north around Bar Point until she brought Bois Blanc light
to bear northeast by east, when she at once steered for it.
The tug, with the bark in tow, was at this time steering
south-southwest. The respective courses were, therefore,
one point divergent. The propeller made the red signallight of the tug and the red signal-light of the bark from a
quarter to half a point over her starboard bow. The McClellan made the green light of the propeller one-fourth of
a point over her port bow. The night was a bright starlight night, with a light wind from southwest. The propeller
was running past the land from six to six and a half miles
an hour. The tug and tow were at about the same speed.
All three of the vessels had their red and green signal-lights
properly displayed, and they were easily distinguishable. At
this time another tug, the Muir, with five vessels in tow, was

slowly ascending the Detroit River a little in advance of the
propeller, and at about the same distance from the eastern
or Canada shore. The bark was towed by means of a
rope paid out from her starboard bow, four feet from the
bowsprit, 360 feet, and made fhst to a samson post in the
deck of the tug, about midships, and some twenty-five feet
from the tafrail, over which it of course played, from starboard to larboard, as the tow might sheer on the one hand
or the other. As the vessels approached each other, their
respective lights closed in until they were running nearly
"stem on." At this juncture, and when separated by about
half a mile, the tug and bark being pretty well on to the
Ameriean shore, and the steamer having a fair berth on the
Canada side, the tug sounded one sharp whistle, and in thirty
seconds repeated the whistle as a signal to the propeller that
she wished her to pass on her port side. The propeller responded with one blast of the whistle, and ported her helm
and displayed to the tug her red signal-light. The tug
ported her own helm when she turned half a point and became steady on her course. The propeller ran past the tug,
port side to port side, with, however, only a narrow berth
between ships, when at the instant in which her stem had
passed the stern of the tug, the bark collided with the propellet on her port side; the port bow of the bark striking
the port bow of the steamer, and the steamer sinling in ten
minutes after the blow. The point of collision was about a
mile and a half below Bois Blanc light; a point at which
tugs usually prepare to cast off their tows, and the tows get
ready to enter the lake, and in this case apparently when
abreast the light, the bark had commenced making sail preparatory to hauling in her line and steering her course down
the lake.
In consequence of the catastrophe the owners of the propeller libelled the bark in the District Court for Wisconsin.
It was not asserted that the tug had been guilty of any fault;
the main matter relied on in support of the libel being that
the bark had not followed the tug, but had made a sudden
sheer. Whether she had made such a sheer or not was a

Statement of the case.

principal point of fact in the case, and one about which
much conflicting evidence was given. Numerous persons
who had been on her swore that she followed straigh-t after
the tug, but not less numerous ones who had been on the
propeller swore that at the instant when her stern had passed
the stern of the tug the bark shut in her red light and
showed her green light to the propeller; a fact which, if
true, would show that she had left her line of direction and
shot off at nearly right angles with the course of the tug.*
It seemed to be in proof that the bark, though a well-steering vessel, had not steered well after the tug through the
night; and the allegation of the steamer was that the bark
having begun to make sail preparatory to steering down the
lake, had misunderstood the whistle sounded by the tug, a
theory which the evidence of the mate supported. But
whether she had made any such sheer as would have made
this accident unavoidable, if the steamer had not been first
guilty of the greatest faults, was another question; and
whether, if she had made such a sheer, the steamer had not
been the cause of her doing so, was yet a third one.
The reader thus sees that the case involved two points:
First. One of mere fact, dependent on conflicting testimony, which it would not be at all worth while to report,
whether there was a sheer but for which the catastrophe
would not have occurred.
Second. A point of law, whether, if so, it was in view of
the propeller's previous conduct, a fault.
The District Court, taking one view of the evidence, considered, apparently, that the alleged sheer was nothing more
than the bark's keeping on her course before she had time
to swing round and follow the tug, a matter which that
court considered would, to those on the steamer, look just
like a sheer.
That court held, therefore, that the propeller was alone to
blame, and it dismissed the libel.t

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

On appeal to the Circuit Court, while that court was fully
of the opinion with the District Court, that the propeller was
in great fault in driving at a reckless rate in narrow water,
where vessels in tow usually cut off from their tugs, and
where a small channel is liable to be crowded by numerous
tows-as this channel at this time actually was crowded-yet
making a somewhat different case on the evidence from that
which the District Court had assumed, it inculpated the bark
also. Onl the first point-the liability of the steamer-it
said th us:
"It is clear that the libellants knew that the Detroit River, on
account of the magnitude of its commerce, and the number of
tugs with loaded vessels passing through it, had to be navigated
with great watchfulness and care, and that the tug and bark
whose lights they had made, as they were descending the river,
could not be handled, in case of peril, as well as the propeller
could.
Notwithstanding these things, we find these officers
managing their boat without regard to the dangers of navigating this river, and exercising no more watchfulness than if they
had been navigating the open lake. Although they saw the
lights of the tug and bark, and pronounced them to be very
bright, at the distance of two miles, yet they did not change the
course of their boat until the tug had signalled them to do it,
and at this time the vessels had approached within half a mile
of each other. But even then, by the practice of reasonable seamanship, all trouble could have been avoided. If the propeller,
instead of porting halfa point, or three-fourths even, had gone
a point further to the eastward, the collision could not have
taken place. There was nothing in the way of her doing this,
for the river was wide enough, and there were no lights closing
on them from the east. To put only one hundred feet between
her and the tug, when she could, with safety to herself,put a
greater distance between them, considering the circumstances
of this navigation, was bad seamanship. Watchful and careful
officers, having due regard to the rights of persons and property,
would not have taken the risk that the officers of the propeller
did. They surely risked enough by not changing the course of
their boat until she was close on to the tug. Common vigilance
required that when they changed the course of the propeller

Dec. 1870.]

THE MARIA MARTIN.
Statement of the case.

they should have made a more decided change. But these
officers, besides not going further to the eastward, were in fault
in not checking the speed of their boat. They should not have
entered a narrow river where in the night there is always more or
less danger of collision, without materially slackening the speed
at which they had been running. And this was only the more
incumbent on them, because, at so short a distance from the tug
and bark, they should, as careful seamen, have apprehended the
possibility of danger."
On the second point-the liability of the bark after examining the evidence-the Circuit Court said thus:
"It is plain, notwithstanding the faults of the propeller, that
this disaster would not have occurred had the bark followed,
as she was required to do, the course of the tug. That she did
not follow after the tug, but when the propeller was abreast of
the tug, sheered to the port of the tug, shutting out trom the propeller her red light, and showing only her preen light, and continued on in this course until she struck the propeller on her
port side, as she was swinging to starboard, is a fact clearly
established by the weight of the evidence. . . . I agree that it
is not easy to reconcile the sheering of the bark, with the testimony of those on board of her, but we are more concerned to
know that the sheering did occur, than to show how it occurred.
. .. The conduct of the bark was the result of either mistaken
orders or careless management. We have the testimony of the
mate that an important signal was mistaken, and it is not at all
unlikely that the error in management commenced with this
mistake. It is in proof, that the bark through the night did
not steer after the tug, and as she was a good steering vessel,
the inference is plain, that there was a want of proper observation on the part of those who had her in charge. The approach
of the propeller was not regarded by her, because the officers of
the deck understood the signal of the tug for casting off line,
instead of an approaching vessel. If a vessel is in tow, she is
not therefore excused from keeping close watch, and observing
and obeying all signals. The duty of watchfulness was the
greater, because the river was full of boats, and light as the
night was, there was more necessity for it, than if it had been
daylight, but this duty does not seem to have been appreciated
by the officers of the bark. When the bark made the sudden

sheer to port, the propeller not being required to anticipate it,
did all she could under the circumstances, put her wheel hard a
port.
"It follows from what has been said, that a decree should be
entered, dividing the loss."
The case was now here on appeal by the owners of the
bark. The owners of the steamer did not appeal, being
content to pay half the loss; and they seeking simply an
affirmance of the decree of the Circuit Court.
Xr. George B. .Hibbard,for the appellant:
I. Collated the evidence with skill, to show
1. That in point of fact there was no sheer, but that the
tug's running off to starboard upon a line divergent half a
point, while, the bark sagged down the stream, caused the
same appearance which the vessels would have presented had
the tug kept her course and the bark sheered, and that this
most natural ocular deception caused such of the witnesses
as swore innocently that the bark sheered, to make that
mistake; and that this running to starboard of the tug, and
sagging down stream of the heavily laden bark, with her
deep draught of water, unable as she was to obey her port
helm as quickly as did the tug, caused the collision to happen in the precise manner in which it did.
2. That it was a physical impossibility that the bark could
have so sheered as to have caused the exact sort of collision,
which confessedly had taken place, and the particular form
of wound which was found to have been left. This position
was elaborately and ably argued on the evidence, with the
aid of diagrams.

vessel, which, through fault, causes haste, alarm, and peril,
shall not escape the consequences of such fault by imputing
something to another vessel which has been caused by the
haste, alarm, and peril thus brought about. The maritime
law, the learned counsel contended, would not tolerate inquiry in favor of a wrongdoer, as to even probable error
committed by another. It would not countenance the weighing of possible culpabilities against the ascertained faults of
a positive offender, much less the comparison of some shade
of imaginable mistake with the transgressions of one absolutely and indefensibly in the wrong. The Circuit Court
had assumed that if the bark did sheer division of damages
must follow. This was fundamental error. To make any
vessel wholly or partly responsible she must commit a fault.
To commit a fault is to violate some rule, some duty. To
sheer is not a fault, it is but an accident. For accident no
man is responsible. The actual question in collision cases
never is, "What was done ?" It is, "Which committed
fault?" It was a great mistake to say, as was said, in the
Circuit Court, that "the court was more concerned to know
that the sheering did occur than to show how it occurred."
The very opposite of this proposition was the true one. Bow
anything occurs in a collision case is of every consequence,
for it is in the manner of the occurrence, its cause, that fault
must exist or not exist. The ascertainment of the facts only
aids in arriving at the conclusion, wherein, and what, and
how many were the faults which produced the result. It is
of but little if any aid to conclude, if this thing had been
done or not done, no collision would have happened. In
almost every collision, if anything different had been done,
there would have been no collision. In the opinion delivered
in the Circuit Court, it is assumed that if the bark sheered,
it was something which the propeller was not bound to
guard against. But was not the propeller bound to guard
against the natural consequences of the haste, alarm, and
peril she created? Nay, more, was she not bound so to
navigate, so to obey plain rules, that haste, alarm, and peril
should not arise?

THE MARTA MARTIN.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

That the propeller was guilty, many times guilty; that
she violated statute and rule, is emphatically declared and
enforced by the Circuit Court; that she brought about the
haste, alarm, and peril, in the midst of which this collision
took place, is not to be doubted. Can it be that under such
circumstances the bark can be held even partly responsible
for the result thus caused? Such a doctrine will inflict a
blow upon commerce which commerce can scarcely sustain;
for practical men will not risk property and incur the hazards of a hazardous business beneath rules of such impracticable severity.
Messrs. Spalding and .Dickman, contra, argued in support of
the decree below.
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Appeals under the additional act "to amend the judicial
system" are subject to the same rules, regulations, and restrictions as are prescribed in case of writs of error.* Both parties
in a civil action may sue out a writ of error, to a final judgment, but where one party only exercises the right the
other cannot assign error in the appellate court; and the
same right to remove the cause forom the subordinate to the
appellate court for re-examination is secured to both parties
by the act of Congress allowing appeals, instead of writs of
error, in cases of equity or of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, or of prize or no prize, as provided in the second
section of the act allowing such appeals.t Subject to the
same rules and regulations as in case of writs of error, both
parties may appeal, in an equity, admiralty, or prize suit,
from the final decree of the subordinate court, but the appeal, when entered in the appellate court, is also subject to
the same restrictions as are prescribed in case of writs of
error. Where each party appeals each may assign error,
but where only one party appeals the other is bound by the
decree in the court below, and he cannot assign error in the

the appeal are correct, except in support of the decree from
which the appeal of the other party is taken.* Apply that
rule to the present case and it is clear that the appellees cannot be heard in opposition to the decree of the Circuit Court,
as they did not appeal from that decree.
They were owners and freighters of the steam propeller
Cleveland, and they filed the libel in the District Court in a
cause of collision, civil and maritime, against the bark
Maria. Martin to recover damages for the loss of the steamer
and her cargo on the twenty-second of June, 1867, occasioned by a collision between the bark and the steamer,
near the mouth of the Detroit River, whereby the steamer,
with all her cargo on board, consisting of sugar, and other
merchandise of great value, was sunk in five fathoms of
water and became a total loss.
Four days before the disaster the steamer started from
Ogdensburg, in the State of New York; and she was bound
on a voyage from that port to the port of Chicago, in the
State of Illinois, laden as aforesaid, and having fifty persons
on board as passengers. None of these facts are denied by
the claimants, but the libellants also allege that the collision
was occasioned without any fault oi the part of the steamer,
and by the negligence, inattention, and want of proper care
and skill oi the part of those in charge of the bark, which
is expressly denied in the answer.
Heavily laden with a cargo of grain, the bark was proceeding down the river, and was bound on a voyage from,
Chicago to Buffalo, in the State of New York, both the colliding vessels being. duly enrolled and licensed for the coasting trade on those waters. Propelled by her own motive
power the steamer had complete and effective command of
her own movements. On the other hand the principal motive power of the bark was the engine of the tug, with
which she was connected by means of a hawser paid out

from the forward part of the vessel, three hundred feet or
more in length, and made fast to the samson post of the
tug, being what is called in such navigation a stern line, as
the design was that the vessel without motive power should
follow the tug which had her in tow, but the bark on this
occasion had unfurled, or "pretty well made," her mainsail,
and her mainstaysail, as she had nearly reached the place in
the river where vessels in tow usually cast off from the tug,
and her master and other officers were in cherge of her
deck.
Prior to rounding Bar Point, on the Canada shore, the
course of the steamer had been west by north, but shortly
after passing that point she changed her course to north by
east, and beaded for Bois Blanc light, as alleged by the
libellants. In coming round, or immediately after she was
put upon her new course, she made the lights of the tug and
tow descending the river towards the lake, heading southsouthwest, at the distance, as supposed, of two miles, and
not fhr from two o'clock in the morning.
Attempt is made in argument to show that the lookout
of the steamer was incompetent, but the objection is without
any legal importance, as the lights of the tug and tow were
seasonably. seen by all those in charge of the deck of the
steamer. They first made the red signal light of the tug
;and of the tow half a point over their starboard bow, and
the evidence shows that the tug having the bark in tow
made the green signal light of the steamer one-fourth of a
[point over her port bow.
Mutual fault is charged, that is, each charges the other
-with fault, and it is quite evident that one or both must be
guilty of the charge, as neither imputes any fault to the tug,
and the evidence fully satisfies the court that it was good
weather, a bright starlight night, a moderate wind, and
smooth water.
Where negligence or fault is shown to have been committed by either party the rule that the loss must rest where it
fell, as in case of inevitable accident, can have no application,
!for if the fault was one committed by the claimant's vessel

alone, then the libellant is entitled to recover; or if by the
libellant's vessel alone, then the libel must be dismissed; or
if both vessels were in fault, then the settled rule of law is
that the damages must be apportioned between the offending vessels.*
Doubtless the district judge applied the second rule, as he
entered a decree dismissing the libel, but the Circuit Court
came to the conclusion from the evidence that both of the
colliding vessels were in fault, and reversed the decree of the
District Court, and entered a decree that each should pay a
moiety of the damages and their own costs, and from that
decree the claimants of the bark appealed to this court, but
the libellants did not appeal, and of course they cannot assign
error nor can they be heard in opposition to the last-named
decree. On the contrary the decree is conclusive as against
the libellants, that the steamer was in fault, and the only
question presented by the appeal of the claimants is whether
the Circuit Court erred in determining that the bark also
was in fault, for if she was, then the decree of the Circuit
Court must be affirmed, but if she was not, then the decree
of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to enter a decree affirming the decree of the District Court.
Vessels engaged in commerce are held liable for damage
occasioned by collision on account of the complicity, direct
or indirect, of their owners, or the negligence, want of care
or skill on the part of those employed in their navigation.
Owners appoint the master and employ the crew, and consequently are held responsible for their conduct in the management of the vessel.
Allusion was frequently made in the course of the argument to the fact that the bark was in charge of a tug,
which renders it necessary to make one or two remarks
upon that subject before proceeding to examine the real
question presented for decision.

THE MARIA MARTIN.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

Whenever the tug is under the charge of her own master
and crew, and in the usual and ordinary course of her employment undertakes to transport another vessel, which for
the time being has neither her master nor crew on board,
from one point to another, over waters where such accessory motive power is necessary, or usually employed, she is
legally responsible for the navigation of both vessels. Cases
arise, undoubtedly, where both the tug and the tow are
jointly liable for the consequences of a collision, as when
those in charge of the respective vessels jointly participate
in their control and management, and the master and crew
of each vessel are either deficient in skill, omit to take due
care, or are guilty of negligence in their navigation. Where
the officers and crew of the tow, as well as the officers and
crew of the tug, participate in the navigation of the vessels,
and a collision with another vessel ensues, the tug alone, or
the tow alone, or both jointly may be liable for the consequences according to the circumstances, as the one or the
other or both jointly were either deficient in skill or were
culpably inattentive or negligent in the performance of their
duties.* Much examination of that subject, however, is unnecessary in this case, as neither party imputes any fault to
the tug, and it is clear from the evidence that the imputation, if made, could not be sustained, as it fully appears that
she seasonably ported her helm and allowed the steamei to
pass her in safety.
All three of the vessels, that is, the tug, the tow, and the
steamer, had their signal lights properly displayed, and the
respective lights were burning brightly and were easily distinguishable. Suggestion is made that the lookout of the
steamer was incompetent, but the suggestion is entitled to
no weight, even if it be well founded in fact, as the proof is
entirely satisfactory that the two colliding vessels were seen
by each other in season to have taken every precaution to
have avoided a collision. They were approaching each other
from nearly opposite directions, which clearly rendered it
* Sturgis v. Boyer, 24 Howard, 121; Sproul v. Henmingway, 14 Pick. 5

Dec. 1870.]

THE MARIA MARTIN.
Opinion of the court.

proper, as between the tug and the steamer, that each should
port their helms and pass to the right. Seasonable attention
to that rule would certainly have prevented a collision if the
tow had followed the movement of the tug, as she was bound
to do, without unnecessary delay.
Although the bark was larger than the steamer, yet her
headway was about the same as that of the steamer, as she
was somewhat aided by the current in addition to the motive
power of the tug. Larger in size and of greater length than
the steamer she probably would not obey her helm quite as
quick as the tug or the steamer, but the evidence in the case
fails to satisfy the court that the difference in that respect
contributed in any degree to the collision.
Probably those in charge of the steamer hesitated for a
time as to which side of the tug they would pass, as they
proceeded on their course, heading nearly stem on, until the
tug and steamer approached within half a mile or less of
each other, when the tug sounded one whistle and in half a
minute repeated the same, as a signal that she wished the
steamer to pass on her port side. To that signal the steamer
responded, giving one whistle to signify her assent to that
request, and immediately ported her helm, and the tug at
the same time ported her own helm, turning the vessel half
a point to the starboard, and became steady on her course,
the tug and steamer passing each other port to port, leaving
a berth between the vessels of about one hundred feet, as
appears by the weight of the testimony.
Undisputed proof is exhibited that the steamer ported her
helm, and that she turned to the right half a point and then
steadied and continued her course, and it is quite clear that
there would have been no collision if the bark had ported
her helm and followed the tug, and it is highly probable that
the disaster would not have happened if she had kept her
course without changing her helm, but she neither ported
her helm nor kept her course, as is fully shown by the evidence. Instead of turning to the right,'as she should have
done, she starboarded her helm when the steamer was alongside the tug and sheered toport, shutting out from the steamer

the view of her red light and showing only her green light,
and continued on that course till she struck the steamer.
Orders were given by those in charge of the steamer to put
her helm hard-a-port, but it was too late, and the collision
took place.
Many theories have been advanced by the claimants as
showing that the bark did not sheer, but it is not possible
to adopt any one of them without rejecting conceded facts
or facts fully proved, or without coming to the conclusion
that the two vessels did not collide, which would be in direct
conflict both with the libel and answer and the testimony of
every witness in the case who was present when the steamer
sunk in the river.
Ingenious efforts are also made in argument to show that
the berth between the steamer and the tug when they passed
each other was not so great as that represented by the libellants. Suppose that theory be admitted, still it cannot benefit
the claimants, so long as it is conceded that the distance between them at the time was sufficient to enable them to pass
in safety, and that the steamer, while they were abreast,
ported her helm and turned to the right, which is as satisfactorily proved as it is that the steamer and tug passed each
other in safety.
Proved as these facts are beyond doubt, it is vain to suppose that any theory can be adopted by the court which
will make it necessary for the court to shut their eyes to the
evidence by which those facts are established. Suffice it to
say, the collision did occur, and the court is satisfied that the
wheelsman of the bark misunderstood the order to port
and supposed it was an order to starboard preparatory to
casting off from the tug. ie knew that the bark, while
she continued in tow, ought to follow the tug, but they had
reached the place where vessels in tow usually cast off from
the tug, and the master was engaged in adjusting the towage
account, and all on deck were looking for the order to cast
off, and under those circumstances it is less strange than it
otherwise might have been that the wheelsman should have
made such a mistake. Undoubtedly it was a great mistake,

but it has been fully proved, and it is clear that the collision
would not have occurred if it had not been made.

those in charge of her navigation noticed that the bark had
shut in her red light and began to display her green light,
showing that she had starboarded her helm and was turning to the left.
Errors committed by one of two vessels approaching each
other from opposite directions do not excuse the other from
adopting every proper precaution required by the special
circumstances of the case to prevent a collision, as the act
of Congress provides that in obeying and construing the prescribed rules of navigation due regard must be had to the
special circumstances rendering a departure from them necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.*
Viewed in the light of that exceptional rule, the better
opinion, perhaps, is that the entire decree of the Circuit
Court was correct.
