of Bissel v. Jeffersonville,* where it was again held that it
was too late to make such objections as against innocent
holders, or even against the railroad, when it appeared that
the bonds purporting on their face to'have been executed by
authority, had been issued and delivered. Very stringent
application of the same rule was made in the case of lereer
Counlty v. Hfacket,t which is the last of the series to which
reference will be made,-all of these cases, proceeding upon
the ground that the construction of a railroad for travel and
transportation was a public improvement, and that it was
competent for the legislature to authorize municipal corporations to furnish material aid for such a work, and we have
no doubt that the views of the court were entirely correct.
Like the preceding, the present case has respect to a plankroad, but we repeat, that where such an improvement is authorized by the legislature and is connected with the municipality issuing the bonds, the case properly falls within the
same rule. It follows that the declaration was sufficient, and
that the demurrer should have been overruled.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore reversed,
with costs, and the cause remanded for further proceedings,
in conformity with the opinion of this court.

a bill of pains and penalties. Within the meaning of the Constitution
bills of attainder include bills of pains and penalties.
4. These bills, though generally directed against individuals by name, may
be directed against a whole
0 class, and they may inflict punishment absolutely, or may inflict it conditionally.
6. Thle clauses of the second article of the constitution of Missouri (set forth
at length in the statement of the case, infra, pp. 279-281), which require
priests and clergymen, in order that they may continue in the exercise
of their professions, and be allowed to preach and teach, to take and
subscribe an oath that they have not committed certain designated acts,
some of which were at the time offences with heavy penalties attached,
and some of which were at the time acts innocent in themselves, constitute a bill of attainder within the meaning of the provision in the Federal Constitution prohibiting the States from passing bills of that character.
6. These clauses presume that the priests and clergymen are guilty of the
acts specified, and adjudge the deprivation of their right to preach or
teach unless the presumption be first removed by their expurgatory
oath: they assume the guilt and adjudge the punishment conditionally.
7. There is no practical difference between assuming the guilt and declaring
it. The deprivation is effected with equal certainty in the one case as
in the other. The legal result is the same, on the principle that what
cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.
8. The prohibition of the Constitution was intended to secure the rights of
the citizen against deprivation for past conduct by legislative enactment, under any form, however disguised.
9. An expostfacto law is one which imposes a punishment for an act which
was not punishable at the time it was committed; or imposes additional
punishment to that then prescribed; or changes the rules of evidence
by which less or different testimony is sufficient to convict than was
then required.
10. The clauses of the second article of the constitution of Missouri, already
referred to, in depriving priests and clergymen of the right to preach
and teach, impose a penalty for some acts which were innocent at the
time they were committed, and increase the penalty prescribed for
such of the acts specified as at the time constituted public offences, and
in both particulars violate the provision of the Federal Constitution
prohibiting the passage by the States of an ex postfacto law. They further violate that provision in altering the rules of evidence with respect
to the proof of the acts specified-thus in assuming the guilt instead of
the innocence of the parties; in requiring them to establish their innocence, instead of requiring the government to prove their guilt; and in
declaring that their innocence can be shown only in one way, by an expurgatory oath.
11. Although the prohibition of the Constitution to pass an exyostfacto law
is aimed at criminal cases, it cannot be evaded by giving a civil form to
that which is in substance criminal.

Statement of tbe case.
IN January, 1865, a convention of representatives of the

people of Missouri assembled at St. Louis, for the purpose
of amending the constitution of the State. The representafives had been elected in INovember, 1864. In April, 1865,
the present constitution-amended and revised from the
previous one-was adopted by the convention; and in June,
1865, by a vote of the people.

The following are the third,

sixth, seventh, ninth, and fourteenth sections of the second
article of the constitution:
SEc. 3. At any election held by the people under this Constitution, or in pursuance of any law of this State, or under any
ordinance or by-law of any municipal corporation, no person
shall be deemed a qualified voter, who has ever been in armed
hostility to the United States, or to the lawful authoritiesthereof, or
to the government of this State; or has ever given aid, comfort,
countenance, or support to persons engaged in any such hostility;
or has ever, in any manner, adhered to the enemies, foreign or
domestic, of the United States, either by contributing to them,
or by unlawfully sending within their lines, money, goods, letters, or information; or has ever disloyally held communication
with such enemies; or has ever advised or aided any person to
enter the service of such enemies; or has ever, by act or word,
manifested his adherenceto the cause of such enemies, or his desire
for their triumph over the arms of the United States, or his sympathy with those engaged in exciting or carrying on rebellion
against the United States; or has ever, except under overpowering compulsion, submitted to the authority, or been in the service, of the so-called "Confederate States of America;" or has
'ever left this State, and gone within the lines of the armies of
the so-called "Confederate States of America," with the purpose of adhering to said States or armies; or has ever been a
member of, or connected with, any order, society, or organization, inimical to the government of the United States, or to the
government of this State; or has ever been engaged in guerilla
warfare against loyal inhabitants of the United States, or in
that description of marauding commonly known as "bushwhacking;" or has ever knowingly and willingly harbored, aided,
or countenanced any person so engaged; or has ever come into or
left this State, for the purpose of avoiding enrolment for or draft

Constitution of the State of Missouri; and that I make this oath without
any mental reservation or evasion, and hold it to be binding on me.'

SEC. 7. Within sixty days after this Constitution takes effect,

every person in this State holding any office of honor, trust, or
profit, under the Constitution or laws thereof, or under any

nor, after that time, shall any person be competent as a bishop,
priest, deacon, minister, elder, or other clergyman of any religious persuasion, sect, or denomination, to teach, or preach, or

loyalty, shall, on conviction thereof, be punished by fine, not less
than five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county
jail not less than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment; and whoever shall take said oath falsely, by swearing or
by affirmation, shall, on conviction thereof, be adjudged guilty
of perjury, and be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary

In 'Q,ptember, A.D. 1865, after the adoption of this constitution, the Reverend Mr. Cummings, a priest of the Roman

Argument for Mr. Cummings.

Catholic Church, was indicted and convicted in the Circuit
Court of Pike County, in the State of Missouri, of the crime
of teaching and preaching in that month, as a priest and
minister of that religious denomination, without having first
taken the oath prescribed by the constitution of the State;
and was sentenced to pay a fine of five hundred dollars and
to be committed to jail until said fine and costs of suit were
paid.
On appeal to the Supreme Court of the State, the judgment was affirmed; and the case was brought to this court
on writ of error, uider the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act.
31r. David Dudley Field, for Mr. Cummings, plaintiffin error:
My argument will first be directed to that part of the
oath which affirms that the person taking it has never "been
in armed hostility to the United States, or to the lawful authorities thereof, or to the government of this State;" ; . . and
has never "given aid, conifort, countenance, or support to persons
engaged in any such hostility ;" . . . and has never "been a
member of or connected with any order, society, or organization inimical to the government of the United States, or to the government of this State." Ifthe imposition of this is repugnant
to the Constitution or laws of the United States, the whole
oath must fall; for all parts of it must stand or fall together.
Mir. Cummings was convicted, because he had not taken
the oath, as a whole. If there be any part of it which he
was not bound to take, his conviction was illegal. The oath
is not administered by portions, and there is no authority so
to administer it.
My first position is, that this provision of the constitution
of Missouri is repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the
United States; because it requires or countenances disloyalty to the United States.
Stripping the case of everything not immediately pertaining to the first position, the oath required may be considered
as if it contained only these words:
"I hereby declare, on oath, that I have never been in armed

Dec. 1866.]

CUXMINGS v. THE STATE OF MISSOURI.

283

Argument for Mr. Cummings.

hostility to the government of the State of Missouri, nor given
aid, comfort, countenance, or support to persons engaged in any
such hostility, and have never been a member of or connected
with any organization inimical to the government of this State."
This is not an oath of loyalty to the United States. The
government of lissouri has been, in fact, hostile to the
United States. This is matter of history. Being in armed
hostility to this hostile State government was an act of loyalty to the United States: an act not to be punished, but to
be rewarded.
The loyal citizens of the State were obliged to array themselves-against its government; they did so; they took up
arms against it; they seized its camp and overthrew its
forces. Had it not been for this act of hostility the State
might have been drawn into the abyss of secession. It was,
therefore, an act which was not only lawful but which was
required of the citizen by his allegiance to the United States.
The Constitution and laws of the United States require
allegiance and active support from every citizen, whatever
may be the attitude of the State government. The difference between the Constitution and the Confederation consists in this, chiefly, that under the Constitution the United
States act directly upon the citizen, and not upon the
State. What the United States lawfully require must be
done, though it be the seizure of the State capitol. The
State of Missouri could not subject the plaintiff in error to
any loss or inconvenience for giving, in 1861, a cup of coffee
to the soldiers who under General Lyon marched out to St.
Louis to take Camp Jackson.
Let us consider, in the second place, the tendency of this
oath, in its relation to possible occurrences. It certainly is
possible for the government of a State to be hostile to the
United States. The governments of the eleven States lately
in rebellion were so. If the legislature of South Carolina
were to pass a law excluding from the pulpit and the offices
of religious teachers every person who has been, at any time
during the late war, "connected with any organization in-

2984

CuminGs v. THME STATE OF MlISSOUI.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for 31r. Cummings.

imical to the government" of South Carolina, that law would
be held disloyal and unconstitutional. Suppose the legislature of South Carolina were to go further, and enact that no
person, white or black, should ever vote in that State, who,
during the war, gave aid, comfort, or countenance to persons engaged in armed hostility to the government of South
Carolina, would not every lawyer pronounce such a law
utterly void?
If such an oath were required in Tennessee, the present
President of the United States could not take it, and would
be disqualified. If it were required in Virginia, more than
one of our generals and admirals would be disqualified.
And so of thousands of other citizens of the States lately in
rebellion, who fought in the Union ranks, and opposed the
governments of their own States.
There may be collisions between the Federal and the
State governments, not breaking out, as the last has done,
into flagrant war. A State government may attempt to resist the execution of a judgment of a Federal court; and the
President may be obliged to call out the militia to assist the
marshal. In such event, every man in the ranks will be in
armed hostility to the government of the State. But the
State cannot make him suffer for it.
This results from the rule of the Constitution, that the instrument itself, and the laws made in pursuance of it, are
the supreme law of the land; and whatever obstructs or impairs, or tends to obstruct or impair, their free and full operation is unconstitutional and void.
The second position which I take is, that the provision
imposing this oath as a condition of continuing to preach or
teach as a minister of the Gospel, is repugnant to that part
of the tenth section of the first article of the Constitution of
the United States which prohibits the States from passing
"any bill of attainder" or "ex postfacto law."
Here, again, let us take a particular part of the oath, and
refer to so much as affirms that the person taking it has
never, "by act or word, manifested his . . . sympathy with

Dec. 1866.]

CuMiiINS v. THE STATE OF MISSOURI.

285

Argument for Mr. Cummings.

those . . . engaged in . . . carrying on rebellion against
the United States." M~aking a simple sentence of this portion, it would read thus:
"I declare, on oath, that I have never, by act or word, manifested my sympathy with those engaged in rebellion against
the United States."
It may be assumed that previous to the adoption of this
Constitution it had not been declared punishable or illegal
to manifest, by act or word, sympathy with those who were
drawn into the Rebellion. It would be strange, indeed, if a
minister of the Gospel, whose sympathies are with all the
children of men-the good and the sinful, the happy and the
sorrowing-might not manifest such sympathy by an act of
charity or a word of consolation. We will start, then, with
the assumption that the act which the plaintiff in error is to
affirm that he has not done was at that time lawful to be
done.
Test oaths, in general, have been held odious in modern
ages, for two reasons: one, because they were inquisitorial;
and the other, because they were used as instruments of
proscription and cruelty. In both respects they are contrary to the spirit, at least, of our institutions, and are indefensible, except when applied to matters outside of the
domain of rights, and when prospective in their operation.
Whatever the people may give or withhold at will, they may
have a constitutional right to burden with any condition they
please. This is at once the origin and extent of the rule.
When applied to past acts, another principle interposes its
shield; that is, that no person can justly be made to accuse
himself. This is incorporated in the fifth amendment, in
the following words:

"No person . . . shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to
be a witness against himself." And although this prohibition is in terms applied to criminal cases, it cannot be evaded by making that civil in form
which is essentially criminal in character.
Retrospective test oaths, that is to say, oaths that the per-

sons taking them have not theretofore done certain things,
are almost unknown.
Among the constitutional guarantees against the abuse
of Federal power thrown around the American citizen, are
these three: First, he cannot be punished till judicially tried;
second, he cannot be tried for an act innocent when committed; and, third, when tried he cannot be made to bear
witness against himself.
Two of these guarantees, and the last two, are set also
against the abuse of State power.
The prohibition to pass an ex post facto law is, in the sense
of the Constitution, a prohibition to pass any law which
"renders an act punishable in a manner in which it was not
punishable when it was committed." The question in the
present case, therefore, becomes simply this: Is it a punishment to deprive a Christian minister of the liberty of preaching and teaching his faith? What is punishment? The infliction of pain or privation. To inflict the penalty of death,
is to inflict pain and deprive of life. To inflict the penalty
of imprisonment, is to deprive of liberty. To impose a fine,
is to deprive of property. To deprive of any natural right,
is also to punish. And so is it punishment to deprive of a
privilege.
Depriving Mr. Cummings of the right or privilege, whichever it may be called, of preaching and teaching as a Christian minister, which he had theretofore enjoyed, and of acting
as a professor or teacher in a school or educational institution, was in effect a punishment.
It is not necessary to inquire whether it was intended as
a punishment. If the legislature may punish a citizen, by
deprivation of office or place, on the ground that his continuing to hold it would be dangerous to the State, then
every punishment, by deprivation of political or civil rights,
is taken out of the category of prohibited legislation. Congress and the State legislatures-for in this respect they lie
under the same prohibition-can pass retroactive laws at
will, depriving the citizen of everything but his life, liberty,
and accumulated capital.

Dec. 1866.]

CUIUMINGS v.

THE STATE

OF

Missou-Ri.

287

Argument for Mr. Cummings.

The imposition of this oath was, however, intended as a
punishment. This is evident from its history and its circumstances. It is patent to all the world that the object of
the exclusion was to affect the person, and not the profession.
Mr. Cummings may possibly, at some moment during the
last five years, have manifested, by act or word, his sympathy
with those engaged in carrying on rebellion against the
United Statbs; he may have given alms to the wounded
rebel prisoners lying in our hospitals, or he may have spoken
to them words of consolation; but no reason can be assigned,
from all that, why he should n6t solemnnize marriage or teach
the ten commandments; nor can any man arrive at the belief
that the convention which devised this constitution had any
such notion.
Let us turn now to the other prohibition, that against
passing any "bill of attainder." This expression is generic,
and includes not only legislative acts to punish for felonies,
but every legislative act which inflicts punishment without
a judicial trial. If the offence be less than felony, the act
is usually called a bill of pains and penalties.
It is not necessary that the persons to be affected by a
bill of attainder should be named in the bill. The attainder
passed in the 28th year of Henry VIII, against the Earl of
Kildare and others (chap. 18, A. D. 1536), enacted that "all
such persons which be, or heretofore have been comforters,
abettors, partakers, confederates, or adherents unto the said
late earl, &c., in his or their false and traitorous acts and
purposes, shall in likewise stand and be attainted, adjudged,
and convicted of high treason."
It is therefore certain, that if Mr. Cummings had been by
name designated in the constitution of Missouri, and thereby
declared to be deprived of his right to preach as a minister
of religion, or to teach in a seminary of learning, for the
reason that he had done some of the acts mentioned in the
oath, such an attempt would have been in contravention of
the prohibition against passing a bill of attainder; and it is
equally certain, that if he had been thereunder judicially

288

CUMMINGS v. THE STATE OF MISSOURI.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for Mr. Cummings.

convicted for doing the same things, being not punishable
when done, the conviction would have been in contravention of the other prohibition against passing an cx post facto
law.

Does it make any difference that these results are effected
by means of an oath, or its tender and refusal? There is
only this difference, that these means are more odious than
the other. The legal result must be the same, if there is
any force in the maxim, that what cannot be done directly
cannot be done indirectly; or as Coke has it, in the 29th
chapter of his Commentary upon Magna Charta, "Quando
aliquid prohibetur, prohibetur et one, per quod devenitur ad
illud."
The constitutional prohibition was intended to protect
every man's rights against that kind of legislation which
seeks either to inflict a penalty without a trial or to inflict a
new penalty for an old matter. Of what avail will be the
prohibition, if it can be evaded by changing a few forms?
It is unquestionably beyond the competency of the State of
Missouri, by any legislation, organic or statutory, to enact
in so many words, that if 'r. Cummings on some occasion,
before it was made punishable, manifested by an act or a word
sympathy with the rebels, therefore he shall, upon trial and
conviction thereof, be deprived of the right (or privilege)
which he has long enjoyed, of preaching and teaching as a
Christian minister. It must be equally incompetent to enact,
that all those Christian ministers, without naming them, who
thus acted, shall be thus deprived. And this is because it
is prohibited to the State to pass an ex post facto law. It is
also unquestionably beyond the competency of the State, to
enact in so many words, that because Mr. Cummings, on
some occasion, after it was made punishable, manifested
such sympathy, therefore he shall, without trial and conviction thereof, be deprived of his profession. It must
be equally incompetent to enact that all those Christian
ministers who have thus acted shall be thus deprived. And
this because it is prohibited to the State to pass a bill of
attainder.

CUMINGS v. THE STATE OF

fissouRi.

289

Argument for Mr. Cummings.

It does not help this kind of legislation that its taking effect was made to depend on the neglect or refusal to take a
prescribed oath; nor help it, to declare that the omission to
take the oath is deemed a confession pf guilt. If Mr. Cummings had even admitted in the presence of the convention
his alleged complicity, that would not have dispensed with
a judicial trial.
The legal positions taken on the part of Mr. Cummings
may be thus restated, He is punished by deprivation of
his profession, for an act not punishable when it was committed, and by a legislative instead of a judicial proceeding.
If this is held to be constitutional because it is not done directly, but indirectly, through the tender and refusal of an
oath, so contrived as to imply, if declined, a confession of
having committed the act, then the prohibition may be
evaded at pleasure. You cannot imagine an instauce of oppression, that the Constitution was designed to prevent,
which may not be effected by this means. Suppose the case
of a man tried for treason, and acquitted by a jury. The
legislature may nevertheless enact, that if the person acquitted by a jury does not take an oath that he is innocent,
he shall be deprived of political and civil rights or privileges.
Suppose that the legislature of New York were to pass an
act disqualifying from preaching the Gospel, or healing the
sick, or practising at the bar, all who during the last year
were "connected with any organization inimical" to the administration of the State government. Such an act would
of course be adjudged inconsistent with the Federal Constitution. But suppose, instead of passing the law in this form,
it should be in the form of requiring an oath from every
person desiring to preach the Gospel, )r to heal the sick, or
practise at the bar, that he had not been connected with
such an organization, would that make the case any better?
You can punish in two ways: you can charge with the alleged crime, and proving it, punish for" it; or you can require the party to purge himself on oath; and if he refuses,
punish him by exclusion from a right, privilege, or employment.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for Mr. Cummings.

Mr. Montgomery Blairfilcd a brief, on the same side, and after
citing several authorities, and enforcing som6 of the arguments of Ar. Field, thus referred especially to the opinions
of Alexander Hlamilton.
M\r. John 0. Hamilton, in his "History of the Republic of
the United States,"* says:
"The animosity natural to the combatants in a civil conflict,
the enormities committed by the Tories, when the scale of war
seemed to incline in their favor, or where they could continue
their molestations with impunity; the inroads and depredations
which they made on private property and on the persons of
non-combatants, and the harsh and cruel councils of which they
were too often the authors, appeared to place them beyond the
pale of humanity. This was merely the popular feeling.
"In the progress of the conflict, and particularly in its earliest periods, attainder and confiscation had been resorted to generally . . . as a means of war; but it was a fact important to
the history of the revolting colonies, that acts prescribing penalties usually offered to the persons against whom they were
directed the option of avoiding them by acknowledging their
allegiance to the existing government."
But there were exceptions to this wise policy. In N'ew
York, especially, there was a formidable party who indulged
the worst feelings and went to the greatest extremes. The
historian of the Republic thus narrates the matter:
"Civil discord," says this author, "striking at the root of each
social relation, furnished pretexts for the indulgence of malignant passions; and the public good, that oft abused pretext,
was interposed as a shield to cover offences which there were
no laws to restrain. The frequency of abuse created a party
interested in its continuance and exemption from punishment,
which, at last, became so strong that it rendered the legislature
of the State subservient to its views, and induced the enactment
of laws attainting almost every individual whose connections
subjected him to suspicion, who had been quiescent, or whose

"A share in the sovereignty of the State which is exercised
by the citizens at large in -voting at the elections, is one of the
most important rights of the subject, and in a republic ought to
stand foremost in the estimation of the law. It is that right
by which we exist, as a free people, and it will certainly therefore never be admitted that less ceremony ought to be used in
divesting any citizen of that right than in depriving him of his
property. Such a doctrine would ill suit the principles of the
Rlevolution which taught the inhabitants of this country to risk
their lives and fortunes in asserting their liberty, or, in other
words, their right to a share in the government. Let me caution against precedents which may in their consequences render
our title to this great privilege precarious."
General Hamilton further remarks:
"The advocates of the bill pretend to appeal to the spirit of
Whigism, while they endeavored to put in motion all the furious and dark passions of the human mind. The spirit of Whigism is generous, humane, beneficent, and just. These men inculcate revenge, cruelty, persecution, and perfidy. The spirit
of Whigism cherished legal liberty, holds the rights of every
individual sacred, condemns or punishes no men without regu-

lar trial and conviction of some crime declared by antecedent
laws, reprobates equally the punishment of the citizen by arbitrary acts of the legislature as by the lawless combinations of
unauthorized individuals, while'these men are the advocates for
expelling a large number of their fellow-citizens, unheard, untried, or, if they cannot effect this, they are for disfranchising
them in the face of the Constitution, without the judgment of
their peers and contrary to the law of the land. . . . Nothing
is more common, than for a free people in times of heat and
violence to gratify momentary passions by letting into the government principles and precedents which afterwards prove fatal
to themselves. Of this kind is the doctrine of disfranchisement,
disqualification,and punishments by acts of the legislature. The
dangerous consequences of this power are manifest. If the legislature can disfranchise any number of citizens at pleasure, by
general descriptions, it may soon confine all the voters to a
small number of partisans, and establish an aristocracy or oligarchy. If it may banish at discretion all those whom particular circumstances render obnoxious, without hearing or trial, no
man can be safe, nor know when he may be the innocent'victim
of a prevailing faction. The name of liberty applied to such a
government would be a mockery of common sense. . . . The
people are sure to be losers in the event, whenever they suffer
a departure from the rules of general and equal justice, or from
the true principles of universal liberty."

There is another sentiment of the great statesman and
lawgiver which may be deemed not inappropriate to the
present unhappy times. He says:
"There is a bigotry in politics as well as in religion, equally
pernicious to both. The zealots of either description are ignorant of the advantage of a spirit of toleration. It is remarkable,
though not extraordinary, that those characters throughout the
States who have been principally instrumental in the Revolution are the most opposed to persecuting measures. Were it
proper, I might trace the truth of these remarks from that
character who has been THE FIRST in conspicuousness, through
the several gradations of those, with very few exceptions, who
either in the civil or military line, have borne a distinguished
part in the war."

.Mr. G. P. Strong, contra, for the State, defendant in error.
I. The separate States were originally possessed of all the
attributes of sovereignty, and these attributes remain with
them, except so far as the people may have parted with them
in forming the Federal Constitution.*
The author of the Federalist, NTo. 45, says:
"The powers reserved to the several State's will extend to all
the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the
lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal
order, improvement, and prosperity of the'State."

R. Among the rights reserved to the States which may
be considered as established upon principle, and by unvarying usage beyond question or dispute, is the exclusive right
of each State to determine the qualificatio of voters and
office-holders, and the terms and conditions upon which
members of the political body may exercise their various
callings and pursuits within its jurisdiction. Authorities
already cited establish this proposition.; so, also, do others.t
HIL The provisions of the second article of the Constitution of M\issouri come within the range of these reserved
rights, and are neither "bills of attainder," or of pains and
penalties, nor "ex post facto laws," nor "laws impairing the
obligation of contracts." They are designed to regulate
the "municipal afihirs" of the State, that is, to prescribe
who shall be voters, who shall hold office, who shall exercise
the profession of the law, and who shall mould the character
of the people by becoming their public teachers.
Bills of pains and penalties, and ex p'ost'facto laws, are
such as relate exclusively to crimes and their punishments.t

Argument for the State.

The true interpretation of these laws by our own courts
is settled by numerous cases in addition to those already
cited.*
Not one of these examples of bills of pains and penalties,
or ex post facto laws, bears any resemblance to the constitutional provisions which the court is now called to pass upon.
They were, in terms, acts defining and punishing crimes.
They designated the persons to be affected by them, and did
not leave it optional whether they would suffer the penalty
or not.
IV. Every private calling is subject to such regulations as
the State may see fit to impose. The privilege of appearing in courts as attorneys-at-law, and the privilege of exercising the functions of a public teacher of the people, have
always been the subjects of legislation, and may be withheld
or conferred, as may best subserve the public welfare. Private rights have always been held subordinate to the public
good.
Even the freedom of religious opinion, and the rights of
conscience which we so highly prize, are secured to us by
the State constitutions, and find no protection in the Constitution of the United States.
If any State were so unwise as to establish a State religion,
and require every priest and preacher to be licensed before
he attempted to preach or teach, there is no clause in the
Federal Constitution that would authorize this court to pronounce the act unconstitutional or void.t

Argument for the State.

V. But we are told that this is not an oath of loyalty to
the government of the United States, because it requires a
declaration that the party has not taken up arms against the
government of the State.
The Constitution of the United States is a part of the
government of the State. It is as much the Constitution
of the people of Missouri as the State constitution. Those
who defended the one defended the other. The State government was never hostile to the Federal government. The
hostility of Governor Jackson was individual and personal,
and was intended to subvert both State and Federal govern-

ments.
Mr. Hamilton says :* "We consider the State governments
and the National government, as they truly are, in the light
of kindred systems, and as parts of one whole."
Chief Justice MeKeant also says: "The government of
the United States forms a part of the government of each
State. These (the State and National) form one complete
government."
Mr. Jefferson,t speaking of the State and Federal governments, says: "They are cobrdinate departments of one
simple and integral whole."

Do the provisions of the second article of the Missouri
constitution conflict with the Constitution of the United
States? The acts objected to are not acts of a State legislature. Even in regard to the constitutionality of such acts it
has ever been thought a delicate duty to pass. If doubt
exists, that doubt is always given in favor of the law. If
ordinary acts of legislation are to be presumed valid, and
are to be set aside only when patient examination brings
them, beyond doubt, into conflict with the supreme law of
the land, how much stronger the presumption in favor of the

act of the people themselves in framing such organic laws
as they may think demanded by the exigency of the times
and necessary to their safety?
The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the United
States provides that "the powers not delegated to the United
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,
are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
No question, therefore, can arise as to the power of the
people of Missouri to adopt the provisions in question unless
they fall within the powers delegated to the United States,
or are prohibited to the States by the Federal Constitution.
The subject-matter of them is clearly not within the powers
delegated to the United States, but belongs to that class of
legislation reserved to the States or to the people, and unless it be directly prohibited to the States by some clause or
clauses of the Federal Constitution the provisions must be
held valid. Among the powers prohibited to the States is
one in the tenth section of the first article of the Constitution, which provides "that no State shall pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of
contracts." This clause is chiefly relied on to avoid the provisions alluded to in the constitution of Missouri.
It has been decided that bills of pains and penalties, which
inflict a milder degree of punishment, are included within
bills of attainder, which refer to capital offences. It has
been said by an accurate writer* that in cases of bills of attainder, "the legislature assumes judicial magistracy, weighing the enormity of the charge and the proof adduced in
support of it, and then deciding the political necessity and
ie says these acts,
moral fitness of the penal judgment."
0 instead of being general, are levelled against the particular
delihquent; instead of being permanent they expire, as to
their chief and positive effects, with the occasion. Now, do
these provisions fall within this definition ? To be obnoxious
as bills of attainder, the provisions 'must operate against some particular delinquent, or specified class of delinquents, and not against

the whole cormnmunity. They must not be permanent laws,
operating as a rule to control the conduct of the whole community, but must expire upon the infliction of punishment
on the individual or individuals nared. Before these provisions can be called bills of attainder, it must appear that
they criminate the defendant for the commission of some
act specified in the third section of the second article of the
Constitution; and that they assume to pronounce the punishment for that act. The law itself must assume to convict
him.
If any means be left by which the defendant can escape
the punishment prescribed in the act, the act cannot be a
bill of attainder; for a bill of attainder assumes the guilt
and punishes the offender whatever he may do to escape.
If the act in question applies as well to the entire commufiity as to him, and operates upon all alike, only prescribing an oath, which may or may not be taken by him and
others, as a condition of a future privilege, it is in no sense
a bill of attainder.
If any objection really exist against these provisions of
the Missouri constitution it is because they are retrospective
in their operation. Whether they are ex post facto laws is,
therefore, the chief question for our examination.
Before proceeding to that examination, an argument of
one of the counsel for the plaintiff must be noticed. Ie
errs not perhaps in logical deduction, but in the statement
of premises.
lie argues thus: Mr. Cummings had the right to preach.
A test oath is prescribed for a person following his profession which he cannot truthfully take, hence he has to forfeit
his right to preach.
This is called a punishment, for the acts of which he is
guilty, and of which he cannot purge himself by oath. The
punishment, then, consists in the forfeiture of this assupned
right to preach the Gospel. Of course, punishment must be
impending to make the objection apply. The real objection
to an 1.1 1 jostfacto law is not that it declares a past innocent
action a crime, but in the fact that it undertakes, after so

298

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for the State.

declaring, to punish it. The Constitution of the United
States steps in to prevent the punishment, not the passage
of the act. Now, if the supposed forfeiture pronounced by
the act is no punishment at all in the eye of the law, the objection ceases.
What is this thing we call punishment for crime in this
country? Punishment under our institutions, legally considered, must affect person or property. It must take the
"life" of an individual, impose restraints on. his "liberty,"
or deprive him of his "property." Common sense teaches
us that no man is punished by the loss of something that
never was his absolute property. If I retake from my neighbor what I had granted him during my pleasure, I inflict no
loss on him. ie loses nothing. Igain nothing. The thing
may be of value, but it is mine. If the thing taken has no
value, although lie may not have received it of me, he does
not suffer. Punishment is to inflict suffering. This view
of the subject is strengthened by the language of the fifth
article of Amendments to the Federal Constitution, and by
similar language in each State constitution. This article
declares, first, that prosecutions, except in particular cases,
shall be commenced by presentment or indictment of a grand
jury. Coming to the trial, it is next provided, that no man
shall be twice tried for the same offence, nor compelled to
be a witness against himself, and then, in the same connection, it provides that he shall not "be deprived of his life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law." The latter part of the clause evidently refers to the punishment of
crime. To punish one, then, is to deprive him of lif5, liberty, or
property. To take from hin anything less than these, is no punishment at all. These are natural rights, and to take them
away is what we properly call punishment. All other rights
are conventional, and may at any time be resumed by the
public, in the most summary way, without any regard to
due process of law. lence, public offices have always been
taken away from the incumbents, by the sovereign act of
the people, without consulting the incumbents, without informing them, without hearing them in their defence, and yet

Argument for the State.

nobody ever supposed this to be a punishment of the incumbents. It is not a punishment, because it deprives them of
no property whatever. The public, it is true, had given
them a trust, but the public had created that trust for their
own purposes, and the public can resume it whenever necessity or convenience require it. And the public alone can
judge of that necessity or convenience.
Let us now proceed to the examination of ex post facto
laws.
Story, J.,* defines an ex post facto law to be one "whereby
an act is declared a crime, and made punishable as such,
whlich was not a crime when done: or whereby the act, if a
crime, is aggravated in enormity or punishment, or whereby
different or less evidence is required to convict an offender
than was required when the act was committed." This
court, in the case of Fletcher v. Peck, said:
"An cx post facto law is one which renders an act punishable
in a manner in which it was not punishable when it was committed."
In Watson et al. v. Mercer,t this court said:
"The phrase ex post facto laws, is not applicable to civil laws,
but to penal and criminal laws, which punish a party for acts
antecedently done, which were not punishable at all, or not punishable to the extent or in the manner prescribed."
Each and every act enumerated in the third section may
have been committed, and yet no provision of this State
constitution attempts to punish it. Indeed, it makes no
provision to punish even in the future the commission of
such acts as are therein specified. The acts enumerated are
not denounced in the constitution as crimes at all, nor is
any punishment whatever attached to their commission.
How, then, is this test oath an ex postfacto law ? It does not
operate on the past. If one stands on his past record, however guilty he may be, this provision cannot touch him. If

Argument for the State.

he is ever punished for what he has done, it must be accordiDg to some previous existing law, and not under this act.
This act does not deal with the past. It looks only to the
future. If it refers to the past at all, it is only for the purpose of ascertaining moral character and fitness for the discharge of high civi.l duties, which give credit and influence
in the community, and can never be safely intrusted in the
hands of base or incompetent men.
But to proceed with the definition. Justice Washington,
delivering the opinion of the court in Ogden v. Saunders,*
speaking of bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and laws
impairing the obligation of contracts, said: " The first two
of these prohibitions apply to laws of a criminal, and the
last to laws of a civil character."
In Calder v. Bull, the first great case involving a definition
of the term ex post facto, in this court, Chase, J., delivered
the opinion of the court, and gave a definition which has
been ever since substantially adopted as the law. He said,
it is :
"First. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal,
and punishes such action.
"Second. Every law that aggravates a crime and makes it
greater than it was when committed.
" Third. Every law that changes the punishment and inflicts
a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when
committed.
"Fourth. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence and
receives less or different testimony than the law required at the
commission of the offence in order to convict the offender."
Does this provision of the State constitution assume to declare any act already done by the defendants, at any time,
to be criminal? Is it, in any sense, a criminal law to operate upon the past? If it had declared that previous acts of
practising law, innocent as they were when done, should

now be offences, and might be punished in the courts, the
provision could not, and should not, be enforced. If the
provision had declared that any person guilty of a previous
expression of sympathy with the public enemy, or of previously enrolling himself as dislbyal, to evade military service in the Union forces, or of seeking foreign protection as
an alien against military service, might now be indicted and
punished therefor, by fine and imprisonment, or both, I
could well understand an argument against its validity.
But this provision does no such thing. It declares no past
act of the defendant to be an offence, nor does it prescrilbe
for any such act any forfeiture whatever, much less the deprivation of a property right. What is a criminal law? It
defines an offence, and fixes the punishment, and the mode
of inflicting it. If it stamps as crime an innocent past action
it is no law. But if it looks only to the future, and gives
the choice to the citizen to violate it or comply with it, it is
a valid law, at least so far as this prohibition is concerned.
This act, it is true, defines an offence, but the offence defined is one that cannot be committed before the expiration
of sixty days after the act shall have been adopted. No
man is compelled to be guilty. That is not the case under
an ex post facto law. In such cases there is no option for
the victim. The act to be punished is done, and cannot be
undone.
A punishment is also denounced in the act, but that punishment is to be applied only to acts of the future. This
act, then, does not make a crime of an action which was innocent when done, and proceed to punish it, and it cannot
in that respect be classed as an ex postfacto law.
If one be guilty of treason, of course he cannot in such
case take the oath, and must therefore stand excluded. It
is not a new or additional penalty or forfeiture for the crime
of treason. It was not so intended. In its true purpose,
such an act is not a criminal law at all, much less an ex post
facto law. It is an act to fix the qualifications of voters, and
applies to the innocent as well as to the guilty. If a man,
having long enjoyed the franchise, be excluded by the soy-

ereign act of the people, unless he will take an oath that he
can read and write, is it to be construed an act to punish
ignorance, or an act to preserve the purity and usefulness
of the ballot-box? If an act were passed vacating the offices
of all sheriffs who had not practised law for five years under
a license, before their election, is the act void?
But we are told that this act alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less testimony than was necessary at the
time the act was committed to convict the offender. If perjury be committed, and at the time of its commission two
witnesses are required to convict, we can understand that a
subsequent act authorizing a conviction on the testimony of
one witness is not valid. We can well understand that a
law which makes testimony competent, that was not competent at the time of the act, is void. But the law will not be
declared void until its obnoxious provisions 'are attempted
to be enforced in some specific case, that is, until a case
arises. The difficulty here is that plaintiffs in error insist
that they are on trial for the offences, or rather the acts of
disloyalty, named in the third section. But they are not
now on trial, for no conviction or judgment therefor can
follow these proceedings. The taking of the oath is not an
acquittal of the offences or acts enumerated. The refusal to
take it is not a conviction, nor does it tend to a conviction.
This act has nothing to do with the trial or conviction of
the offender for past actions; it fixes no rule or rules of evidence by which a conviction may be had more easily, for
there can be no trial or conviction at all under the act for
anything previously done.
The Constitution provides that no person "shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself,
nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law." It is insisted that the provisions of the
Missouri law conflict with this clause, which clothes in language a great principle of national right. If, on the trial of
the case of Mr. Cummings, he had been compelled to testify
against himself, there would be some ground for the complaint. We have already attempted to show that he is not

deprived of life, liberty, or property under this law. iHe is
surely not deprived of life or liberty, and the right to pursue his profession is not such an absolute right of -property
as to be above the control and regulation of State law. It is
said he is punished without the right of trial " by an impartial jury," and without the right "to be confronted by the
witnesses against him;" without the right of "compulsory
process for obtaining witnesses" in his favor, and without
that other invaluable right, "the assistance of counsel" in
his defence. Suppose it were so, what has this court to do
with it? These great rights are only secured by the Colistitution "in all criminal prosecutions" set on foot by the
United States and not in those set on foot by the States.
And now, in the present prosecution against Mr. Cummings
for violating the act itself, or in any prosecution that may be
hereafter instituted against him, or other persons, for such
violation, if any of these rights shall be denied them we may
say the act is unjust, but that is the end of it. The State
may do acts of injustice if it chooses. We must trust something to the States. Mr. Cummings, however, had the right
of trial by jury; the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him; the right of process to compel the attendance of his witnesses; and even those beyond the limits
of our own country will know that he has had "the assistance of counsel," for he was ably defended in the courts of
the State, and they who now defend him are known wherever enlightened jurisprudence itself is known.
Whenever prosecutions arise under these provisions, there
will, doubtless, be granted, in Missouri, to the accused, all
these guarantees of constitutional liberty. The State cannot deny them to one of its citizens without denying them
to all; and to suppose a people so lost to common sense as
to deprive themselves, voluntarily, of these great and essential rights, necessary to a condition of fr-eedom, is to suppose
them incapable of self-government.
But an objection is also urged which is well calculated to
excite interest. The rights of conscience are sacred rights.
They are too often confounded, however, with" the unre-

strained license to corrupt, from the pulpit, the public taste
or th6 public morals. However this may be, the American
people are exceedingly sensitive on the subject of religious
freedom; and whenever the people are told, as they have
been in this case, that the indefeasible right to worship God
according to the dictates of conscience is about to be invaded,
the public mind at once arouses itself to repel the invasion.
The first article of the amendments to the Constitution is in
these words:
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."
The third clause of the sixth article declares that
"No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to
any office or public trust under the United States."
Story, J., commenting on these provisions, says:
"The whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the State governments, to be acted upon according to
their own sense of justice and the State constitutions."
The Jew, the infidel, and the Christian are equal ofily in
the national councils. The States may make any discrimination in favor of any sect or denomination of Christians,
or in favor of the infidel and against the Christian. North
Carolina had the right to exclude the Catholic from public
trusts; and other States have the right, so long exercised,
to deny ministers of all dmnominations a place in their legislative halls. Congress cannot establish a national faith; but
where are the limitations on the powers of the States to do
so? There are none, unless they be found in this provision
against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws-a provision
which, in its present interpretation, saps and withers every
right once fondly claimed by the States. In the formation
of State constitutions, I have never doubted the power to
regulate the modes of worship or prescribe forms for the
public observance of religion. Hence it is that the bills of
right, to be found in all the State constitutions, attempt to

secure this great right of free and unrestricted worship
against the caprice or bigotry of State legislators. But within the limits of the State constitution, when thus framed,
the legislature has entire control of the subject.
It is said these oaths are unprecedented. They are, no
doubt, extraordinary, perhaps unprecedented; but the provisions themselves are no more extraordinary than the circumstances which called them into existence. These last
are not known to all, and indeed are known fully but to few.
I must ask the privilege of departing so far from the line
of strict legal argument as partially to state them. Such a
statement is indispensable truly to understand this case.
The bare recital of these provisions, I am aware, has fallen
harshly on the public ear. Loyal men in other States hesitated to justify them, while the disloyal hastened to denounce
them. Beyond the limits of Missouri, they, perhaps, have
had but few advocates. But beyond those limits, no man
knows the terrible ordeal through which her people passed
during the late Itebellion. To appreciate their conduct properly, one must have been on the soil of the State, and that
alone is not sufficient: he must have been an active participant in the struggle for national life and personal security.
The men of Missouri, at an early day in this war, learned
to be positive men. They were for, or they were against.
When the struggle came, each man took his place. The
governor and the legislature were disloyal. A convention
called by that legislature, merely to give character to the
mockery of secession, proved to be loyal, and refused to
submit an ordinance of secession to a pretended vote of the
people. Hence came a fierce war of opinion. The first
great contest was for political power. Each party qaw the
absolute necessity of obtaining it. With it, ultimate success
might be achieved; without it, success was impossible. In
the midst of this controversy, while the issue was yet in
doubt, Fort Sumter was attacked, and civil war suddenly
broke upon the land. In Missouri, it was a hand-to-hand
contest, each party fighting for the possession of power,

and each feeling that expulsion was the penalty of failure.
Acts of the grossest treason were committed; but no man
could be found who confessed himself present, or who would
speak the truth against his neighbor. His silence, however,
made him no less earnest. Neighbors and friends of long
standing separated and joined hostile forces. Each county
had its military camps, and each municipal township its
,opposing military and political organization. Traitors and
spies came from the confederate armies of Arkansas and
Texas to organize regiments secretly in the State, and found
shelter and food in the houses of the disloyal. Organized
armies sprang into existence around us, and joined the advancing hosts, to assist in the work of devastation and death.
Some who did not themselves go into open rebellion from
prudential reasons, some too old to bear arms, urged others
to go, and furnished means and money to equip them.
Some acted as spies in their respective neighborhoods, and
sent secret information to the enemy, which often sealed the
fate of their neighbors. The merchant in his store-room
talked treason to his customers; the school teacher instilled
its poison into the minds of his pupils; the attorney harangued juries in praise of those whose virtue demanded the
great charters of English liberty, and denounced the spirit
of this age for its submission to usurpation and tyranny.
And even the minister of heaven, forgetting of what world
his Master's kingdom was, went forth to perform the part
allotted to him in this great work of iniquity.
No man was idle. No man could be idle. 'Menmight
be silent, but they were earnest; because life, and things
dearer than life, depended on the issue. The whole man,
mental and physical, was employed. The whole community
was alike employed, and every profession, and every avocation in life was made subservient to the great end,-the
success or overthrow of the government. On the day when
the delegates to the convention which framed this constitution were elected, General Price, at the head of twenty
thousand desperate men from Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana,
and Missouri, was sweeping through the State, leaving be-

Opposing counsel seem to suppose that the clause in the
Federal Constitution which would prevent an ex post facto
law is not applicable to the organic law of a State. They
argue that even if a provision such as is contained in the
constitution of Iissouri would be void -in a statute law of
the State, yet it is not void when in her constitution.
There is no warrant for the distinction. The ninth section of the first article of the Constitution of the Uiited
States restrains Congress from passing any bill of attainder
or any ex post facto law, and the great men by whom that
instrument was framed were so well satisfied that legislation
of this description was inconsistent with all good government, that they deemed it necessary to impose the same restriction upon the States; and this they did by providing that
"no State"-nbt no legislatureof a State, but that "no Stateshould pass any ex post facto law or any bill of attainder. If
we consult the contemporaneous construction-and which
has ever been received almost as conclusive authority upon
its meaning-given it by the Federalist, we will find* that
it was not thought necessary to vindicate the Constitution
upon the ground that it contained a provision of this description. It was thought sufficient to say that the provision

was but a declaration of a fundamental principle of free government, a principle without which no such government
could long exist, and that it was adopted not because there
was any doubt in regard to it upon the part of the convention, or because any doubt was entertained what would be
the public opinion in relation to it, but because it was so
universally held to be important that it was deemed necessary not only by express constitutional provision to inhibit
to Congress the power to pass such laws, but to prohibit the
States at any time from doing so either.
It can make no difference, therefore, whether such legislation is found in a constitution or in a law of a State; if it
be within the prohibition it is void; and the only question,
therefore, is whether the constitution of Mlissouri, in the
parti'ular which is involved in this case, is not liable to the
objection of being ex postfacto.
ly brothers of the other side suppose that there is no
punishment imposed by the constitution of Missouri upon
one who refuses to take the oath. They do not mean,
surely, no punishment in the general sense of the term;
that he whose livelihood depends on his profession is not,
in the general acceptation of the term, punished if he is not
permitted to pursue it; that he whose business it is, claiming to derive his authority from a higher than any human
source, to preach peace on earth, good will to men, is not
punished when he is told that he shall do neither; that a
man is not punished when he is prevented from teaching
his own child (for this oath comprehends that act) the ways
which he believes are the only ways that lead to perpetual
happiness inithe future; cannot teach him what he deems
to be man's duty to man and man's duty to God ;-without
taking an oath which any State from party, political, or religious prejudice, may think proper to prescribe.
A prohibition of the sort here enacted, operating to the
extent that it does, is not only punishment but most severe
punishment; perhaps the most severe.
And, if it is a punishment in fact, why is it not a punishment that falls within the inhibition of the Constitution ?

R~eply for Mr. Cummings.

The inhibition is absolute and as comprehensive as language
can make it.
Now what does the constitution of Missouri assume? It
assumes that there are persons in the State of Missouri Who
have been guilty of disloyalty to the United States. Opposing counsel argue that it was of importance to the future
welfare of Missouri, when the constitution was adopted, that
such a provision as this should be incorporated in her fundamental law. 'And why? Because, as they assert, there were
secret, silent, insidious traitors in her ihidst; traitors, also,
whose hands were red with the blood of loyal citizens. The
argument, therefore, as well as the provision itself, assumes
that crime has been committed, and that it is important to
the State that all who have been guilty of that crime shall
forever be excluded from any of the offices or the employments mentioned in the third section of the second article
of the constitution. Then it was put there evidently for the
pa 'pose of disfranchisiag those who wer6 thus assumed to be
guilty. Whether they were guilty or not, and how they
were to be punished if that guilt should be established by
due course of law, is one question. Whetherj if guilty, 'they
could be punished in the way in which they are punished by
this constitution is a different question. If they are guilty,
and are so to be punished, how that guilt is to be established
is a third question.
Hlow was their guilt to be established, according to the
requirements of the constitution, if the charge of treason
was made against them? By two witnesses. What would
be the effect upon an individual if he was convicted? No
disfranchisement. Capacity to hold office as far as any positive legal disability was concerned-capacity to appear as
attorney-capacity to pursue his religious pursuits; all
would remain unaffected.
What does this provision in the constitution of Missouri
do? It assumes that it is not sufficient that society is
secured by such punishment as the previous law provided.
If the court should think proper in its discretion to award
the punishment of imprisonment, and the party survives,

he cannot be punished again in any way in the remainder
of his life. If he seeks employment afterwards, the question
of prior guilt may be held to affect his character; but that
found to be fair and he trustworthy, the road to honor and
to office may be open to him. This constitution of Missouri
says that this is not enough; that the public safety demands
that, if be is guilty, he shall be excluded from all offices in
that State; not only from all offices, but from all employments; not only from professional employment, but from
carrying on the avocation with which, in his own belief,
heaven itself has endowed him; not only that, but from
being an officer in any municipal or other corporation, although he may own nearly all the stock, and from holding
any trust.
Is that not ex post facto? The very definition of such a law,
which opposing counsel have given upon the authority of
this court in the case of Calder v..B1, and in the subsequent
cases, brings such a provision within it. Even if we were to
stop here, any law, and, as has been already shown, any constitution, which imposes a punishment for crime in addition
to that which the existing law at the time of its commission
imposed, is ex postfacto.
But that is not all. It not only imposes an additional punishment, but it changes altogether the evidence by which,
under the previous law, the crime was to be established.
Two witnesses to the same overt act were necessary to prove
the offence of treason. This constitution says, in effect, that
"it is true that hundreds and thousands in the State of
Missouri have been guilty of acts of disloyalty which would
subject them to punishment for treason under the existing
law; and it is true that they may be punished under that
law effectively, provided the government which thinks
proper to prosecute them can establish their guilt by such
evidence as the constitution dernands; but that will not
answer our purpose; we cannot accomplish our end in that
mode; we not only propose to' aggravate the punishment,
but we propose to establish the crime by evidence which is
now inadmissible for that purpose." And what is that evi-

dence as they themselves present it? "You, MNr. Cummings,
desire to preach, to solemnize marriage, to bury the dead,
to administer the sacrament of the Eucharist, to console the
dying; you shall not do either, unless you will swear that
you have not committed the offence: you must purge yourself by your own oath, or, as far as we are concerned, we
find you guilty. We believe you are guilty; and if you are
guilty, we do not mean that you shall execute your relig-,
ious functions at all. And we make the fact of your refusing to swear that you are innocent conclusive evidence of
your guilt, and punish you accordingly."
Now, Congress has treated an exclusion from the right
to hold office as a punishment. The act of the 10th April,
1790, defines and punishes perjury, and for punishment, it
is declared that the party shall undergo "imprisonment not
exceeding three years, and a fine not exceeding eight hundred dollars; and shall stand in the pillory for one hour, and
be thereafter rendered incapable of giving testimony in any of the
courts of the United States until such time as the judgment so
given against the said offender shall be reversed."* It is plain
that to take from him the privilege of being a witness was
considered a punishment. By the twenty-first section, the
crime defined is that of attempting to corrupt a judge, and
as punishment, it is declared that the party "shall be fined
and imprisoned, and shall forever be disqualfied to hold any
office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States." In
accordance with the impression that that was not only punishment, but punishment of a very severe nature, we find in
the act of July 17, 1862,t "an act to suppress insurrection,
to punish treason," &c., passed of course whilst the Rebellion
was in full force, this provision:
"That every person guilty of either of the offences described
in this act shall be forever incapable and disqualified to hold any
office under the United States."

the priest from the right to preach or to teach is not ex post
facto legislation within the meaning of those terms in the
Constitution, because it is not the legal consequence of any
crime; something having no connection with the crime.
They admit, therefore, that if the punishment can attach
itself to the crime, and it be a punishment not known to the
laws at the time the crime was committed, it is void. Now,
what does the State constitution do? Does it not exclude
because of the crime, in consequence of the crime, and only
in consequence of the crime? If it does, it is, in the judgment of Missouri, or in the judgment of its constitution, a
punishment of the crime just as effectually as if a party was
tried upon an indictment and convicted, and the law authorized a party, upon that conviction, to be excluded from the
right to practise or to preach. That no proceeding, judicial
in its nature, is provided for, can make no difference; a proceeding still more effective is provided. A proceeding by
indictment might or might not accomplish the end; the two
witnesses required might not be found; the party might,
therefbre, be acquitted. His guilt might be in his own bosom,
and no witness could be found, and, consequently, he would
be acquitted. And as its object was to strike at the crime,
and remove those who were supposed to be loyal in the State
of Missouri from the contamination of the crime or of the
criminal, it requires him to swear that he has not committed
it, and tells him, "1Not swearing, we find you have committed the crime, and will punish you adcordingly."
Suppose that, instead of excluding Mr. Cummings from
the practice of his calling, it had said that if he did not
answer he should be subjected to a pecuniary penalty, a fine,
or to imprisonment, both or either; would not that be void
because of the restriction? And if so, must not this be held
void, provided we agree with Congress in the opinion contained in the two acts already referred to, that exclusion
from the right to hold office is "punishment?"
The degree, the extent, the character of the punishment,
has nothing to do with the fact of punLshment. Admit that

by this State constitution, and the constitution falls just as
absolutely as if, instead of ordaining that persons should be
punished by not being permitted to exercise and carry on
their occupations, it had said, "if you do not swear to your
innocence we infer you to be guilty, and we fin'e and imprison you." It would be as much in that case, and not
more, a consequence of the crime, as it is in this case. And
once hold it to be consequential upon the crime, and you
bring it within the inhibition, provided the punishment
which it does inflict is not the punishment which the law
inflicted at the time the crime is alleged to have been committed.
As a member of that Church which claims to have its authority directly through a regular and unbroken apostolic
succession from the Author of our religion, Mr. Cummings
is found in the enjoyment and practice of all the privileges
belonging to the function and of all the sacred rights which
are incident to it. The Constitution of the United States,
to be sure, so far as the article which proclaims that there
shall be no interference with religion is concerned, is not
obligatory upon the State of Missouri; but it announces a
great principle of American liberty, a principle deeply seated
in the American mind, and now almost in the entire mind
of the civilized world, that as between a man and his conscience, as relates to his obligations to God, it is not only
tyrannical but unchristian to interfere. It is almost inconceivable that in this civilized day the doctrines contained in
this constitution should be considered as within the legitimate sphere of human power. "This question," it has been
truly said by another clergyman sought to be restrained by
this constitution, "is not one merely of loyalty or disloyalty,
past, present, or prospective. The issue is whether the
Church shall be free or not to exercise her natural and inherent right of calling into, or rejecting from, her ministry
whom she pleases; whether yielding to the dictation of the
civil power she shall admit tbose only who, according to its
judww-;at, are fit for the office, or, admitting those to be fit,
whether she shall not be free to admit those also who, though

at first not fit, afterwards become so through pardon and forgiveness.
"The question is whether the Church is not as much at
liberty and as fully competent nowadays as at the beginning to call in as well the saints as those who were sinners,
as well the Baptist and Evangelist as St. Peter and St. Paul,
the denier and persecutor of the Redeemer, as well as his
presanctified messenger and beloved disciple. With all these
questions the State itself has nothing to do. Their decision
is the high and unapproachable prerogative of the Church,
under the guidance of its Redeemer, who alone is the
searcher of hearts, and whose power itisto recall or reject
whom he pleases."
,y associate, in his opening of the case, has stated that the
State government of Missouri was at one time, 1861, hostile
to the government of the United States; and that loyal citizens were obliged to take up arms and overthrow it. No
doubt the fact must be so admitted. Governor Claiborne
Jackson, holding the executive authority of the State under
a proper election, and the judiciary and the legislative departments of the same State holding their respective authorities under a proper election, held in pursuance of a constitution then existing and not disputed, were at one time in
the full possession of all the sovereignty of the State of Missouri, as far as that sovereignty was delegated by the people
to its government. The Representatives of the State elected
during the continuance of that constitution were received
here. Their Senators were here, chosen by that legislature,
and their credentials testified by the then governor. Their
courts were in session under the authority of that constitution.
Under the decision in Luther v. Borden,* the court cannot
go beyond these facts for the purpose of ascertaining in what
condition, politically, Missouri was, for the purpose of answering the inquiry, what was the government of Missouri
in 1861 ? Then it is plain that this oath calls upon the party

to swear that he has been loyal to two governments of Missouri, one of which was directly opposed to the other.
Opposing counsel, indeed, say that the government of
Mlissouri does not mean the government strictly speaking
of the State of Missouri, constituted by the people of the
State of 'Missouri; but that the government of Missouri is a
compound, according to their view, consisting of the constitution and laws of Missouri and the Constitution and laws
of the United States. But the argument is without force.
When a law speaks of a State government it does not
mean the government of the United States. Nor does it
mean to include any authority over the people of a State
which the government of the United States may possess by
virtue of the Constitution of the United States. It means
that political institution created by the people of the State
for the government of the people of the State, without any
regard at al to the other inquiry, over what subjects the
people of that State have a right by government to assume
jurisdiction.
If this is so, and it be true that a State government is one
government as contradistinguished from all others, and that
the government of the United States is another government
as contradistinguished from a State government, then an
oath which requires a party to swear that he has committed
no act of hostility against the State government, and no act
of hostility as against the government of the United States,
is an oath which, if he has committed acts of hostility against
the State government, renders it impossible that he can enjoy the franchise made dependent upon the failure to exercise any acts of hostility. Yet that is this oath.
It is said that what Missouri has done, in regulating the
qualifications of those who are to hold office and pursue certain professions, is simply the right to define the qualifications which Missouri, in the exercise of her sovereignty,
thinks proper to demand. Is it so? In one sense it is so;
but is that the sense in which the provision has been incorporated in the constitution ? To prescribe age, property
qualifications, or any other qualification that anybody has

an equal opportunity of acquiring, is one thing; to disqualify
because of imputed crimes, is quite another thing. The
powers of government exerted in the doing of these two
things are entirely distinct. In the one, the power to regulate the qualifications for office, or for the pursuit of callings,
only is involved; in the other, the power of forfeiture under
the power to punish is involved, and those two powers are
altogether distinct. The one is the power which belongs to
every government to define and punish crime. The other,
that which belongs to every free government to provide for
the manner in which its agents are to be chosen, and the
conditions upon'which its citizens may exercise their various
callings and pursuits.
Mr. Justice FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.
This case comes before us on a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri, and involves a consideration of
the test oath imposed by the constitution of that State. The
plaintiff in error is a priest of the Roman Catholic Church,
and was indicted and convicted in one of the circuit courts
of the State of the crime of teaching and preachiin as a
priest and minister of that religious denomination without
having first taken the oath, and was sentenced to pay a fine
of five hundred dollars, and to be committed to jail until
the same was paid. On appeal to the Supreme Court of
the State, the judgment was affirmed.
The oath prescribed by the constitution, divided into its
separable parts, embraces more than thirty distinct affirmations or tests. Some of the acts, against which it is directed,
constitute offences of the highest grade, to which, upon conviotion, heavy penalties are attached. Some of the acts have
never been classed as offences in the laws of any State, and
some of the acts, under many circumstances, would not even
be blameworthy. It requires the affiant to deny not only
that he has ever "been in armed hostility to the United
States, or to the lawful authorities thereof," but, among
other things, that he has ever, "by act or word," manifested
his adherence to the cause of the enemies of the United

States, foreign or domestic, or his desire for their triumph
over the arms of the United States, or his sympathy with
those engaged in rebellion, or has ever harbored or aided any
person engaged in guerrilla warfare against the loyal inhabitants of the United States, or has ever entered or left the
State for the purpose of avoiding enrolment or draft in the
military service of the United States; or, to escape the performance of duty in the militia of the United States, has
ever indicated, in any terms, his disaffection to the government of the United States in its contest with the Rebellion.
Every person who is unable to take this oath is declared
incapable of holding, in the State, "any office of honor,
trust, or profit under its authority, or of being an officer,
councilman, director, or trustee, or other manager of any
corporation, public or private, now existing or hereafter
established by its authority, or of acting as a professor or
teacher in any educational institution, or in any common or
other school, or of holding any real estate or other property
in trust for the use of any church, religious society, or congregation."
And every person holding, at the time the constitution
takes effect, any of the offices, trusts, or positions mentioned,
is required, within sixty days thereafter, to take the oath;
and, if he fail to comply with this requirement, it is declared
that his office, trust, or position shall ipsofacto become vacant.
No person, after the expiration of the sixty days, is permitted, without taking the oath, "to practice as an attorney
or counsellor-at-law, nor after that period can any person be
competent, as a bishop, priest, deacon, minister, elder, or
other clergyman, of any religious persuasion, sect, or denomination, to teach, or preach, or solemnize marriages."
Fine and imprisonment are prescribed as a punishment
for holding or exercising any of "the offices, positions,
trusts, professions, or functions" specified, without having
taken the oath; and false swearing or affirmation in taking
it is declared to be perjury, punishable by imprisonment in
the penitentiary.

CummiNas v. THE

3TATE

OP MISSOURI.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

The oath thus required is, for its severity, without any
precedent that we can discover. In the first place, it is retrospective; it embraces all the past from this day; and, if
taken years hence, it will also cover all the intervening
period. In its retrospective feature we believe it is peculiar
to this country. In England and France there have been
test oaths, but they were always limited to an affirmation of
present belief, or present disposition towards the government, and were never exacted with reference to particular
instances of past misconduct. In the second place, the oath
is directed not merely against overt and visible acts of hostility to the government, but is intended to reach words,
desires, and sympathies, also. And, in the third place, it
allows no distinction between acts springing from malignant
enmity and acts which may have been prompted by charity,
or affection, or relationship. If one has ever expressed sympathy with any who were drawn into the Rebellion, even if
the recipients of that sympathy were connected by the closest
ties of blood, he is as unable to subscribe to the oath as
the most active and the most cruel of the rebels, and is
equally debarred from the offices of honor or trust, and the
positions and employments specified.
Butj as it was observed by the learned counsel who appeared 6n behalf of the State of Missouri, this court cannot
decide the case upon the justice or hardship of these provisions. Its duty is to determine whether they are in conflict with the Constitution of the United States. On behalf
of Missouri, it is urged that they only prescribe a qualification for holding certain offices, and practising certain callings, and that it is therefore within the power of the State
to adopt them. On the other hand, it is contended that
they are in conflict with that clause of the Constitution
which forbids any State to pass a bill of attainder or an ex
Post facto law.
We admit the propositions of the counsel of Missouri,
that the States which existed previous to the adoption of
the Federal Constitution possessed originally all the attributes of sovereignty; that they still retain those attributes,

except as they have been surrendered by the formation of
the Constitution, and the amendments thereto; that the new
States, upon their admission into the Union, became invested with equal rights, and were thereafter subject only
to similar restrictions, and that among the rights reserved
to the States is the right of each State to determine the
qualifications for office, and the conditions upon which its
citizens may exercise their various callings and pursuits
within its jurisdiction.
These ai-e general propositions and involve principles of
the highest moment. But it by no means follows that,
under the form of creating a qualification or attaching a
condition, the States can in effect inflict a punishment for a
past act which was not punishable at the time it was committed. The question is not as to the existence of the power
of the State over matters of internal police, but whether
that power has been made in the present case an instrument
for the infliction of punishment against the inhibition of the
Constitution.
Qualifications relate to the fitness or capacity of the party
for a particular pursuit or profession. Webster defines the
term to mean "any natural endowment or any acquirement
which fits a person for a place, office, or employment, or
enables him to sustain any character, with success." It is
evident from the nature of the pursuits and professions of
the parties, placed under disabilities by the constitution of
Missouri, that many of the acts, from the taint of which
they must purge themselves, have no possible relation to
their fitness for those pursuits and professions. There can
be no connection between the fact that Mr. Cummings entered or left the State of Missouri to avoid enrolment or
draft in the military service of the United States and his
fitness to teach the doctrines or administer the sacraments
of his church; nor can a fact of this kind or the expression
of words of sympathy with some of the persons drawn into
the rebellion constitute any evidence of the unfitness of the
attorney or counsellor to practice his profession, or of the
professor to teach the ordinary branches of education, or of

Opinion of the court.

the want of business knowledge or business capacity in the
manager of a corporation, or in any director or trustee. It
is manifest upon the simple statement of many of the acts
and of the professions and pursuits, that there is no such
relation between them as to render a denial of the commission of the acts at all appropriate as a condition of allowing
the exercise of the professions and pursuits. The oath could
not, therefore, have been required as a means of ascertaining whether parties were qualified or not for their respective
callings or the trusts with which they were charged. It was
required in order to reach the person, not the calling. It
was exacted, not from any notion that the several acts designated indicated unfitness for the callings, but because it was
thought that the several acts deserved punishment, and that
for many of them there was no way to inflict punishment
except by depriving the parties, who had committed them,
of some of the rights and privileges of the citizen.
The disabilities created by the constitution of Missouri
must be regarded as penalties-they constitute punishment.
We do not agree with the counsel of Missouri that "to punish one is to deprive him of life, liberty, or property, and
that to take from him anything less than these is no punishment at all." The learned counsel does not use these terms
-life, liberty, and property-as comprehending every right
known to the law. He does not include under liberty freedom from outrage on the feelings as well as restraints on
the person. He does not include under property those estates which one may acquire in professions, though they are
often the source of the highest emoluments and honors.
The deprivation of any rights, civil or politicat, previously
enjoyed, may be punishment, the circumstances attending
and the causes of the deprivation determining this fact.
Disqualification from office may be punishment, as in cases
of conviction upon impeachment. Disqualification from the
pursuits of a lawful avocation, or from positions of trust, or
from the privilege of appearing in the courts, or acting as
an executor, administrator, or guardian, may also, and often
has been, imposed as punishment. By statute 9 and 10

to be guardian or executor; to take any legacy or deed of

of these rights all are equal before the law. Any deprivation or suspension of any of these rights for past conduct is
punishment, and can be in no otherwise defined.
Punishment not being, therefore, restricted, as contended
by counsel, to the deprivation of life, liberty, or property,
but also embracing deprivation or suspension of political or
civil rights, and the disabilities prescribed by the provisions
of the Missouri constitution being in effect punishment, we
proceed to consider whether there is any inhibition in the
Constitution of the United States against their enforcement.
The counsel for 'Iissouri closed his argument in this case
by presenting a striking picture of the struggle fbr ascendency in that State during the recent Rebellion between the
friends and the enemies of the Union, and of the fierce
passions which that struggle aroused. It was in the midst
of the struggle that the present constitution was framed,
although it was not adopted by the people until the war had
closed. It would have been strange, therefore, had it not
exhibited in its provisions some traces of the excitement
amidst which the convention held its deliberations.
It was against the excited action of the States, under such
influences as these, that the framers of the Fedexal Constitution intended to guard. In Fletcher v. Peek,* Mr. Chief
Justice MNarshall, speaking of such action, uses this language: "Whatever respect might have been felt for the State
sovereignties, it is not to be disguised that the framers of
the Constitution viewed with some apprehension the violent
acts which might grow out of the feelings of the moment;
and that the people of the United States, in adopting that
instrument, have manifested a determination to shield themselves and their property from the effects of those sudden
and strong passions to which men are exposed. The restrictions on the legislative power of the States are obviously
founded in this sentiment; and the Constitution of the United
States contains what may be deemed a bill of rights for the
people of each State."

CUMMINGS V. THE STATE OF MISSOURI.

Opinion of the court.

"N'o
State shall pass any bill of attainder, ex.post facto
law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts.'"
A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial.
If the punishment be less than death, the act is termed a
bill of pains and penalties. Within the meaning of the Constitution, bills of attainder include bills of pains and penalties. In these cases the legislative body, in addition to its
legitimate functions, exercises the powers and office ofjudge;
it assumes, in the language of the text-books, judicial magistracy; it pronounces upon the guilt of the party, without
any of the forms or safeguards of trial; it determines the
sufficiency of the proofs produced, whether conformable to
the rules of evidence or otherwise; and it fixes the degree
of punishment in accordance with its own notions of the
enormity of the offence.
"Bills of this sort," says Air. Justice Story, "have been
most usually passed in England in times of rebellion, or
gross subserviency to the crown, or of violent political excitements; periods, in which all nations are most liable (as
well the free as the enslaved) to forget their duties, and to
trample upon the rights and liberties of others."*
These bills are generally directed against individuals by
name; but they may be directed against a whole class. The
bill against the Earl of Kildare and others, passed in the
reign of Henry VIH,t enacted that "all such persons which
be or heretofore have been comforters, abettors, partakers,
confederates, or adherents unto the said" late earl, and certain other parties, who were named, "in his or their false
and traitorous acts and purposes, shall in likewise stand, and
be attainted, adjudged, and convicted of high treason;" and
that "the same attainder, judgment, and conviction against
the said comforters, abettors, partakers, confederates, and
adherents, shall be as strong and effectual in the law against
them, and every of them, as though they and every of them

had been specially, singularly, and particularly named by
thei proper names and surnames in the said act."
These bills may inflict punishment absolutely, or may inflict it conditionally.

The bill against the Earl of Clarendon, passed in the reign
of Charles the Second, enacted that the earl should suffer
perpetual exile, and be forever banished from the realm;
and that if he returned, or was found in England, or in any
other of the king's dominions, after the first of February,
1667, he should suffer the pains and penalties of treason;
with the proviso, hQwever, that if be surrendered himself
before the said first day of February for trial, the penalties
and disabilities declared should be void and of no effect.*
"A British act of Parliament," to cite the language of the
Supreme Court of Kentucky, "might declare, that if certain
individuals, or a class of individuals, failed to do a given act
by a named day, they should be deemed to be, and treated
as convicted felons or traitors. Such an act comes precisely
within the definition of a bill of attainder, and the English
courts would enforce it without indictment or trial by jury."t
If the clauses of the second article of the constitution of
Missouri, to which we have referred, had in terms declared
that Mr. Cummings was guilty, or should be held guilty, of
having been in armed hostility to the United States, or of
having entered that State to avoid being enrolled or drafted
into the military service of the United States, and; therefore,
should be deprived of the right to preach as a priest of the
Catholic Church, or to teach in any institution of learning,
there could be no question that the clauses would constitute
a bill of attainder within the meaning of the Federal Constitution. If these clauses, instead of mentioning his name,
had declared that all priests and clergymen within the State
of Missouri were guilty of these acts, or should be held
guilty of them, and hence be subjected to the like deprivation, the clauses would be equally open to objection. And,

Opinion of the court.

further, if these clauses had declared that all such priests
and clergymen should be so held guilty, and be thus deprived, provided they did not, by a day designated, do certain specified acts, they would be no less within the inhibition of the Federal Constitution.
In all these cases there would be the legislative enactment
creating the deprivation without any of the ordinary forms
and guards provided for the security of the citizen in the
administration of justice by the established tribunals.
The results which would follow from clauses of the character mentioned do follow from the clauses actually adopted.
The difference between the last case supposed and the case
actually presented is one of form only, and not of substance.
The existing clauses presume the guilt of the priests and
clergymen, and adjudge the deprivation of their right to
preach or teach unless the presumption be first removed
by their expurgatory oath-in other words, they assume
the guilt and adjudge the punishment conditionally. The
clauses supposed differ only in that they declare the guilt
instead of assuming it. The deprivation is effected with
equal certainty in the one case as it would be in the other,
but not with equal directness. The purpose of the lawmaker in the case supposed would be openly avowed; in
the case existing it is only disguised. The legal result must
be the same, for what cannot be done directly cannot be
done indirectly. The Constitution deals with substance,
not shadows. Its inhibition was levelled at the thing, not
the name. It intended that the rights of the citizen should
be secure against deprivation for past conduct by legislative
enactment, under any form, however disguised. If the inbibition can be evaded by the form of the enactment, its
insertion in the fundamental law was a vain and futile proceeding.
We proceed to consider the second clause of what Mr.
Chief Justice Marshall terms a bill of rights for the people
of each State-the clause which inhibits the passage of an
ex post facto law.
By an ex postfacto law is meant one which imposes a. pun-

Opinion of the court.

ishment for an act which was not punishable at the time it
was committed; or imposes additional punishment to that
then prescribed; or changes the rules of evidence by which
less or different testimony is sufficient to convict than was
then required.
In Fletcher v. Peck, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall defined an
ex post facto law to be one "which renders an act punishable
in a manner in which it was not punishable when it was
committed." "Such a law," said that eminent judge, "may
inflict penalties on the person, or may inflict pecuniary penalties which swell the public treasury. The legislature is
then prohibited from passing a law by which a man's estate,
or any part of it, shall be seized for a crime, which was not
declared by some previous law to render him liable to that
punishment. Why, then, should violence be done to the
natural meaning of words for the purpose of leaving to the
lbgislature the power of seizing for public use the estate of
an individual, in the form of a law annulling the title by
which he holds the estate? The court can perceive no sufficient grounds for making this distinction. This rescinding
act would have the effect of an ex post facto law. It forfeits
the estate of Fletcher for a crime not committed by himself,
but by those from whom he purchased. This cannot be
effected in the form of an ex post facto law, or bill of attainder; why, then, is it allowable in the form of a law annulling the original grant ?"
The act to which reference is here made was one passed
by the State of Georgia, rescinding a previous act, under
which lands had been granted. The rescinding act, annulling the title of the grantees, did not, in terms, define any
crimes, or inflict any punishment, or direct any judicial proceedings; yet, inasmuch as the legislature was forbidden
from passing any law by which a man's estate could be
seized for a crime, which was not declared such by some
previous law rendering him liable to that punishment, the
chief justice was of opinion that the rescinding act had the
effect of an ex post facto law, and was within the constitutional prohibition.

CUMvMINGS V. THE STATE OF MISSOURI.

327

Opinion of the court.

The clauses in the Missouri constitution, which are the
subject of consideration, do not, in terms, define any crimes,
or declare that any punishment shall be inflicted, but they
produce the same result upon the parties, against whom
they are directed, as though the crimes were defined and
the punishment was declared. They assume that there are
persons in Missouri who are guilty of some of the acts designated. They Would have no meaning in the constitution
were not such the fact. They are aimed at past acts, and
not future acts. They were intended especially to operate
upon parties who, in some form or manner, by action or
words, directly or indirectly, had aided or countenanced the
R~ebellion, or sympathized with parties engaged in the Rebellion, or had endeavored to escape the proper responsibilities and duties of a citizen in time of war; and they were
intended to operate by depriving such persons of the right
to hold certain offices and trusts, and to pursue their ordinary and regular avocations. This deprivation is punishment; nor is it any less so because a way is opened for
escape from it by the expurgatory oath. The framers of
the constitution of Missouri knew at the time that whole
classes of individuals would be unable to take the oath prescribed. To them there is no escape provided; to them
the deprivation was intended to be, and is, absolute and
perpetual. To make the enjoyment of a right dependent
upon an impossible condition is equivalent to an absolute
denial of the right under any condition, and such denial,
enforced for a past act, is nothing less than punishment imposed for that act. It is a misapplication of terms to call it
anything else.

Now, some of the acts to which the expurgatory oath is
directed were not offences at the time they were committed.
It was no offence against any law to enter or leave the State
of Missouri for the purpose of avoiding enrolment or draft
in the military service of the TTnited States, however much
the evasion of such service might be the subject of moral
censure. Clauses which prescribe a penalty for an act of
this nature are within the terms of the definition of an ex

828

OUMMINGS v. THE STATE oF MISSOURI.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

post facto law-" they impose a punishment for an act not
punishable at the time it was committed."
Some of the acts at which the oath is directed constituted
high offences at the time they were committed, to which,
upon conviction, fine and imprisonment, or other heavy penalties, were attached. The clauses which provide a further
penalty for these acts are also within the definition of an ex
post facto law-" they impose additional punishment to that
presdribed when the act was committed."
And this is not all. Thd clauses in question subvert the
presumptions of innocence, and alter the rules of evidence,
which heretofore, under the universally recognized principles of the common law, have been supposed to be fundamental and unchangeable. They assume that the parties
are guilty; they call upon the parties to establish their innocence; and they declare that such innocence can be shown
only in one way-by an inquisition, in the form of an expurgatory oath, into the consciences of the parties.
The objectionable character of these clauses will be more
apparent if we put them into the ordinary form of a legislative act. Thus, if instead of the general provisions in the
constitution the convention had provided as follows: Be it
enacted, that all persons who have been in armed hostility
to the United States shall, upon conviction thereof, not only
be punished as the laws provided at the time the offences
charged were committed, but shall also be thereafter rendered incapable of holding any of the offices, trusts, and positions, and of exercising any of the pursuits mentioned in
the second article of the constitution of Missouri ;-no one
would have any doubt of the nature of the enactment. It
would be an ex post facto law, and void; for it would add a
new punishment for an old offence. So, too, if the convention had passed an enactment of a similar kind with reference to those acts which do not constitute offences. Thus,
had it provided as follows: Be it enacted, that all persons
who have heretofore, at any time, entered or left the State
of Missouri. with intent to avoid enrolment or draft in the
military service of the United States, shall, upon conviction

Opinion of the court.

thereof, be forever rendered incapable of holding any office
of honor, trust, or profit in the State, or of teaching in any
seminary of learning, or of preaching as a minister of the
gospel of any denomination, or of exercising any of the professions or pursuits mentioned in the second article of the
constitution ;-there would be no question of the character
of the enactment. It would be an exrostfacto law, because
it would impose a punishment for an act not punishable at
the time it was committed.
The provisions of the constitution of Missouri accomplish
precisely what enactments like those supposed would have
accomplished. They impose the same penalty, without the
formality of a judicial trial and conviction; for the parties
embraced by the supposed enactments would be incapable
of taking the oath prescribed; to them its requirement
would be an impossible condition. NSow, as the State, had
she attempted the course supposed, would have failed, it
must follow that any other mode producing the same result
must equally fail. The provision of the Federal Constitution, intended to secure the liberty of the citizen, cannot be
evaded by the form in which the power of the State is exerted. If this were not so, if that which cannot be accomplished by means looking directly to the end, can be accomplished by indirect means, the inhibition may be evaded at
pleasure. NVo kind of oppression can be named, against
which the framers of the Constitution intended to guard,
which may not be effected. Take the case supposed by
counsel-that of a man tried for treason and acquitted, or,
if convicted, pardoned-the legislature may nevertheless
enact that, if the person thus acquitted or pardoned does not
take an oath that he never has committed the acts charged
against him, he shall not be permitted to hold any office of
honor or trust or profit, or pursue any avocation in the
State. Take the case before us ;-the constitution of M'issouri, as we have seen, excludes, on failure to take the oath
prescribed by it, a large class of persons within her borders
from numerous positions and pursuits; it would have been
equally within the power of the State to have extended the

330

CuATN'ieIGS v. THE

STATE OF

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

exclusion so as to deprive the parties, who are unable to
take the oath, from any avoeation whatever in the State.
Take still another case :-suppose that, in the progress of
events, persons now in the minority in the State should obtain the ascendency, and secure the control of the government; nothing could prevent, if the constitutional prohibition can be evaded, the enactment of a provision requiring
every person, as a condition of holding any position of honor
or trust, or of pursuing any avocation in the State, to take
an oath that he had never advocated or advised or supported
the imposition of the present expurgatory oath. Under this
form of legislation the most flagrant invasion of private
rights, in periods of excitement, may be enacted, and individuals, and even whole classes, may be deprived of political
and civil rights.
A question arose in New York, soon after the treaty of
peace of 1783, upon a statute of that State, which involved
a discussion of the nature and character of these expurgatory
oaths, when used as a means of inflicting punishment for
past conduct. The subject was regarded as so important,
and the requirement of the oath such a violation of the
fundamental principles of civil liberty, and the rights of the
citizen, that it engaged the attention of eminent lawyers and
distinguished statesmen of the time, and among others of
Alexander Hamilton. VWe will cite some passages of a
paper left by him on the subject, in which, with his characteristic fulness and ability, he examines the oath, and demonstrates that it is not only a mode of inflicting punishment, but a mode in violation of all the constitutional
guarantees, secured by the Revolution, of the rights and
liberties of the people.
"If we examine it" (the measure requiring the oath), said
this great lawyer, "with an unprejudiced eye, we must acknowledge, not only that it was an evasion of the treaty,
but a subversion of one great principle of social security,
to wit: that every man shall be presumed innocent until he
is proved guilty. This was to invert the order of things;
and, instead of obliging the State to prove the guilt, in order

to inflict the penalty, it was to oblige the citizen to establish
his own innocence to avoid the penalty. It was to excite
scruples in the honest and conscientious, and to hold out a
bribe to peijury. . . . It was a mode of inquiry who had
committed any of those crimes to which the penalty of disqualification was annexed, with this aggravation, that it
deprived the citizen of the benefit of that advantage, which
he would have enjoyed by leaving, as in all other cases, 'the
burden of the proof upon the prosecutor.
"To place this matter in a still clearer light, let it be supposed that, instead of the mode of indictment and trial by
jury, the legislature was to declare that every citizen who
did not swear he had never adhered to the King of Great
Britain should incur all the penalties which our treason laws
prescribe. Would this not be a palpable evasion of the
treaty, and a direct infringement of the Constitution? The
principle is the same in both cases, with only this difference
in the consequences-that in the instance already acted upon
the citizen forfeits a part of his rights; in the one supposed
he would forfeit the whole. The degree of punishment is
all that distinguishes the cases. In either, justly considered,
it is substituting a new and arbitrary mode of prosecution
to that ancient and highly esteemed one recognized by the
laws and constitution .of the State. I mean the trial by
jury.
"Let us not forget that the Constitution declares that trial
by jury, in all cases in which it has been formerly used,
should remain inviolate forever, and that the legislature
should at no time erect any new jurisdiction which should
not proceed according to the course of the common law.
Nothing can be more repugnant to the true genius of the
common law than such an inquisition as has been mentioned
into the conseiences of men. .

spect to past conduct were to be made the condition on
which individuals, who have resided within the British lines,

that right, which ought to be deemed still more sacred, many
of us are so infatuated as to overlook the mi.~chief.
"To say that the persons who will be affected by it have
previously forfeited that right, and that, therefore, nothing
is taken away from them, is a begging of the question. Hlow
do we know who are the persons in this situation? If it be
answered, this is the mode taken to ascertain it-the objection returns-'tis an improper mode; because it puts the
most essential interests of the citizen upon a worse footing
than we should be willing to tolerate where inferior interests
were concerned; and because, to elude the treaty, it substitutes for the established and legal mode of investigating
crimes and inflicting forfeitures, one that is unknown to the
Constitution, and repugnant to the genius of our law."
Similar views have frequently been expressed by the judiciary in cases involving analogous questions. They are
presented with great force in The matter of Dorsey;* but we
do not deem it necessary to pursue the subject further.
The judgmeut of the Supreme Court of M'Nissouri must be
reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to enter
a judgment reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court,
and directing that court to discharge the defendant from
imprisonment, and suffer him to depart without day.
