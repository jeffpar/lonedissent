BROBST ET AL. V. BROBST.

This court cannot take jurisdidtion on a certificate of division in a case
where the question certified is one of fact and can only be determined
by an examination of the evidence in the record.

Tins case came here on a certificate of division from the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania.
The -record showed a lifigation in respect to an alleged
fraud in obtaining a deed of large tracts of land by the principal defendant from the complainant. The decree found
the fraud alleged, and held the deed null as to the principal
defendant, but stated that the judges were opposed in opinion
on the question whether his four co-defendants, who claimed
by deeds under him, were chargeable as privies to the fraud,
and this question was accordingly certified to this court.
.f1essrs. Brent and Merrick moved to dismiss the case for
want of jurisdiction.
The CHEF JUSTICE: The question is one of fact, and
can only be determined by an examination of the evidence
in the record; and it has been repeatedly determined that
only questions of law upon distinct points in a cause can be
brought to this court by certificate.*
An order must be made, therefore, remanding this cause
to the Circuit Court, without answer to the question certified, for want of jurisdiction.
