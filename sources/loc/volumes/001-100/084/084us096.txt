BAILEY V. RAILROAD COMPA'Y.
A railroad company -with stockholders and bondholders, being much embarrassed, put before the latter a plan, by which they should surrender a
part of I.heir bonds and receive preferred stock ther.t-or: the same to
"be 7 per cent. stock and not cumulative, but to share with the
common stock any sturplus which may be earned over and above 7
per cent. upon both in.any one year." The bondholders having accepted
the plan, a-committee was appointed to ;carry out the intention" of it.
The committee reported an indenture in form to be signed by the bondholders and the company. The indenture contained this provision:
"And said corporation covenants and agrees that said preferred stock shall be
entitled to a dividend of 7 per cent. from the net earnings of said road in
each year, before any dividend shall be declared upon other unpreferred shares
of said corporation, and to an equal dividend with said other shares in the net
earnings of said corpoation, beyond sAID 7 per cent., but shall at no time be
entitled to -an accumulatea dividend," &c. The indenture was approved by
"the stockholders, who ordered it to be executed, and ordered the directors
"to procure such certificates in relation to the preferred stock, te be issued
under said -agreement, as may he necessary to carry the same into effect." In
#corDaqknce.with'this the directors issued and gave to the former bondhld~rs:eehticates which-, premising, that they were issued in adjustMsfnt of bonds,. . and subject to the terms And conditions of the indenture," &c., atd ",with the rights set forth therein," declared that the

ERROR to the Circuit Court for Missouri; the case being
thus:
The Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad, in Missouri, with
an income of but $450,000, and having a capital stock of
$3,000,000, a debt of $8,000,000 of 7 per cent. bonds, and an
arrear in interest of $4,000,000-both bonds and interestsecured by mortgage on all the property of the company,
found itself, A. D. 1862, in consequence of the then universal
depression of values brought about by the rebellion, in such
embarrassments that it could neither pay dividends on its
stock nor interest on its debt; and as the State of. Missouri
had a lien of $3,000,000 upon it, which had precedence of
every other claim, it became obvious that some vigorous
measures of reorganization were necessary if anything was
to be saved for either bond creditors or stockholders.
In this state of things, on the 15th of October, 1862, the
company issued to the several holders of its bonds a circular
entitled, "A plan for extricating it from its present difficulties,
and improving its securities." In this plan the company proposed to these several bondholders that they should exchange their bonds in part for other bonds, having a longer
time to run, and in part for preferred stock; "the preferred
stock to be 7 per cent., and not cumulative, but to share
with the common stock any surplus which may be earned
over and above 7 per cent., UPON BOTH, in any one year."
Prior to November 24th, 1862, all the bondholders had
come into this plan; their assent-being signified by an
agreement in these words annexed to the plani itself:

set opposite our names, respectively, hereby agree to surrender
the same and receive in exchange therefor new bonds and preferred stock, in accordancewith the-provisions of the plan for extricatingthe companyfrom its present difficulties and improving its
securities, dated 15th October, 1862, and hereunto annexed."
On the same 24th of November, 1862, the board of directors of the road
"Volod, that Messrs. Bartlett, Thayer, and =annewell be,
and they are hereby appointed a committee with power to carry
out the intention of the circular of October itb,1862, entitled
'A plan for extricating it from its present difficulties and improying its securities,' and that they are authorized to make
such expenditures therefor as to them may seem discreet."
This committee, in discharge of the duties of their appointment, reported an "indenture" to be executed by the
company on the one hand, and the bondholders or the trustees of the mortgage on the other, which, after referring to
the embarrassments of the company, went on to give effect
to the plan; though no reference was anywhere-made in the
instrument to this agreement itself. The indenture contained this clause:
"And said corporation covenants and agrees that said preferred stock shall be entitled to a dividend of 7 per cent.
from the net 'earnings of said road in each year, whenever a
dividend of said net earnings shall be made, before any dividend shall be declared upon other unpreforred shares of said
corporation, and to an equal dividend with said other shares in
the net earnings of said corporation beyond SAID 7 per cent.,
but in no case to be entitled to an accumulated dividend (in case
a dividend shall fail to be made in any one or more years, or, if
made, be inshifficient to pay said 7 per cent.) in any subsequent division of said net earnings, but shall be entitled only in
that event to SAID 7 per cent., and to share in said surplus
earnings as aforesaid."
On the 1st April, 1863, this form of indenture being laid
before the board of directors, was by it referred to a stock-

[Sup. CL.

Argument for the holders of preferred stock.

given to the bondholders, who received them without any
expressed exception to their tenor.
In January, 1870, the company had so far retrieved its
disasters as to declare a dividend of 7 per cent. on the preferred stock. Having yet a surplus it made a dividend of
8 per cent. of it to the common or unpreferred stock, to the
exclusion of the preferred stock, and was about to make
another dividend of 3J per cent. in the same way.
Hereupon one Bailey, owner of several shares of the preferred stock, filed a bill, annexing the indenture and fbrm
of certificate, but not the plan, as exhibits, to enjoin this
further dividend on the unpreferred stock, and to have it
appropriated to the preferred stock.
The defendants answered the bill, annexing the plan and
form of certificate, but not the indenture, as exhibits, and
contending that on a true construction of the documents in
the case no such appropriation ought to be made; and on the
hearing they introduced, against the objection of the plaintiff, the evidence of persons who had prepared the indenture,
,that it was drawn with the purpose of giving effect to the
plan, and that from the commencement of the transaction to
its conclusion parties concerned understood the transaction
as they, the defendants, alleged it when rightly construed
to be.
The court dismissed the bill and the complainant appealed.
Messrs. Glover and Shepley, for the appellant:
1. The evidence as to how parties other than Bailey understood the arrangement was so palpably improper that we
spend no time in arguing the point that it was so.
2. The indenture is the contract, and the only contract in
the case. All preceding suggestions and propositions were
merged in this more. solemn instrument. Now, the words
"said 7 per cent." in it show that the meaning of the parties
was that the holders of the preferred stock should equally
share in any dividend which might be declared from the net
earnings beyond "the said 7 per cent,," which by the terms

Dec. 1872.]

Argument for the holders of common stock.

of the indenture was first to be set apart for a dividend upon
the preferred stock.
3. There is nothing in the concluding language of the
certificate opposed to this idea. Contrariwise, that language
accords with the idea. When, after speaking of the dividend'of $7 per shae to be applied as a dividend upon the
preferred stock, the sentence continues "and to share in any
surplus beyond $7 per share," it has reference to the surplus
remaining after the $7 had been applied to the payment of
a dividend of that amount on the preferred stock. At best
the language is doubtful, and as the certificate on its face
declares that it is issued "subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture," and "with the rights therein set
forth," the doubt must be cleared up by the plain language
of the solemn and fundamental instrument of the contract.
Nay, if the concluding language of the certificate were opposed to Bailey's claim he would have a right to have the
certificate reformed, according to the indenture to whose
"terms and conditions" it declares that it is issued. The
indenture does not state that it is made in pursuance of execution of the plan, or even so much as refer to it.
The fact is that the defendants, to overturn our claim,
have to reconstruct the whole contract. They have to add
to the sentence a new phrase, containing a new idea, as
thus:
"And to an equal dividend with said other shares in the net
earnings of said corporation beyond said 7 per cent., after an
equal dividend shall have been next declared upon the said unpreferred stock."
.Mlessrs. T. T. Gantt and J7. Carr, contra:
There is a radical defect iai the argument of the opposing
counsel in supposing that the indenture is the fundamental
contract. The plan, which was so specifically assented to by
the bondholders as that their assent is on a paper appended
to it, is the basis of everything. The indenture was undoubtedly prepared and executed to carry it out, and if giving rights varying from it, might be reformed by it. Now,

by the plan, the 7 per cent. is to be "1n b t cumulative, but to
share with the common stock any surplus which may be
earned over and above 7 per cent. upon both in any one Year."
This language is fatal to the complainant's case.
The word "said," which makes the complainant's strongest point, is exceedingly apt, even in carefully drawn'documents, to be inadvertently repeated. In this case, unlike most
cases, the inadvertence somewhat affects the meaning. But
all the documeiits form part of one transaction, and of course
are to be taken together. The indenture is to be read by the
light of the plan which preceded and the certificate which
followed it. The maxim of the law is, "Ex antecedentibus
et consequentibus optima fit inlerpretatid." And when we look
at the plan submitted, the. circumstances under which the
committee which drafted the indenture was appointed, the
agreement with the bondholders which the committee was
instructed to embody and carry out, the action bf the directors upon the indenture, the reference bf the question of its
adoption to a stockholders' meeting, the guarded terms of
the resolution then passed, and, finally, the definition unequivocally given, of the nature of the preferred stock by

both the corporation and its bondholders, by the form of the
certificate adopted, all doubt vanishes as to the consfruction
which mustbe placed on all the documents.
To all this may be- added, though it is unnecessary, the
concurrent testimony of persons who prepared the indenture
and other parties concerned in the matter; a sort of testimony not, we think, improper, and which, if received, is in
its nature stroqg.
Mr.Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion ofthe court.
Certificates of stock, described in the bill of complaint as
common or unpreferred stock, amounting to $3,000,000,
were issued by the respondents, divided into shares of one
hundred dollars each, which constituted their capital stock.

the company at different times, in aid'of the construction
and equipment of the road, and which were secured by three
several mortgages, and were known as land bonds, convertible bonds, and second mortgage bonds. Embarrassrment necessarily ensued, as the stock of the company had
become of no value in the market, and as the respondents
were unable to pay the interest on their bonds or to make
any dividends, they issued to the holders of the bonds a circular or plan for extricating the company from their difficulties and for improving their securities. By that plan
they proposed to the several holders of the bonds that they
should exchange the same in part for other bonds and in
part for preferred stock of such a nature that its holders
should have the right to receive " 7 per cent., not cumulative, but to share with the common stock any surplus which
may be carried over and above 7 per cent. upon both in any
one year." Measures were adopted to senid that circular to
all the holders of the bonds, and it appears that a large majority of the bondholders approved and accepted the terms
and conditions of the proposed arrangement, and as evidence
thereof signed an instrument by which they agreed to surrender the mortgage bonds which they held, and receive, in
exchan'ge therefbr, new bonds and preferred stock in accordance with the provisions of the plan for extricating the company from its present difficulties and for improving their
securities; that the respondents thereupon appointed a committee with power to carry it into effect; that the committee
prepared an indenture to accomplish that end; that they
subsequently, by order of the directors, submitted the same
to a meeting of the stockholders convened for that purpose,
and that the stockholders did then and there accept and
ratify the action of the directors and of the committee and
ordered that the indenture should be duly executed and delivered. Authority was also conferred upon the directors,
at the same meeting, to adopt, in behalf of the company,
such certificates in relation to the preferred stock to be
issued under the agreement "as may be necessary to carry
the same into effect," and to cause the same to be executed,

in behalf of the company, as they may think best. They,
the directors, accordingly prepared and adopted, in behalf
of the company, the form in which all of the certificates of
the preferred stock were for a time issued by the respondents, which contains the recital that the holder "shall be
entitled to receive all' the net earnings of said company
which may be divided pursuant to said indenture in each
year, up to $7 per share, and to share in any surplus beyond
$7 per share which may be divided upon the common stock."
Certificates of preferred stock were issued in that form until
the legislature passed the act authorizing the company to
convert their bonds secured by mortgage into preferred
stock, when the certificates issued in that form were recalled
and a new form was adopted, but inasmuch as it contains
the sanie provision in respect to the. right of the holder to
participate in the yearly net earnings of the company it need
not be reproduced, except to say that the certificates in the
second form, as well aiiii the first, purport, on their face,
to be issued subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture between the company and the trustees, which the
stockholders directed should be executed and delivered to
carry the plan sent to the bondholders into effect. Pursuant
to that order it was executed, and it contains the following
provision : "That said preferred stock shall be entitled to a
dividend of 7J per cent. from the net earnings of said road
in each year, whenever a dividend of said net earnings shall
be made, before any dividend shall be declared upon other
tunpreferred shares of said corporation, and to an equal dividend with said other shares of the net earnings of the company beyond said 7 per cent., but shall at no time be entitled
to an accumulated dividend in any subsequent division of
sllid net earnings." Eight hundred shares of the preferre'd
stock are owned by the complainant, and he filed the bill of
complaint claiming that by the true construction of the indenture the preferred stock is entitled, not only to a dividend
of 7 per cent. from the net earnings of the road in each year,
before any dividend is declared in favor of the unpreferred
stock, but also to an equal dividend with the unpreferred

Opinion of the court.

stock in the net earnings of the same year beyond the
amount required to discharge the dividend of 7 per cent.
secured to the preferred stock.
Shares of the preferred stock, it is conceded, are entitled
to a dividend of 7 per cent. from the net earnings of the
road in each year whenever a dividend of net earnings is
made, before any dividend can be claimed for the shares of
the unpreferred stock, as that is a matter of priority created
by the indenture, but it is insisted by the respondents that
the priority does not extend beyond the 7 per cent., that
when that priority is satisfied the preferred stock is not entitled to any further dividend in that year until the unpreferred stock shall receive a 7 per cent. dividend from the net
earnings of the road in the same year.
Ten and a half per cent. net having been earned by the
road in one year, the directors, adopting the views of the
respondents, made a dividend of 7 per cent. upon the preferred stock, and having satisfied that priority, they made a
dividend of K per cent. from the residue of the net earnings beyond the 7 per cent upon the unpreferred stock, and
the complainant insisting that the fund of 81 per cent. was
to be shared equally between the preferred and the unpreferred stock, filed the present bill of complaint and prayed
for an injunction to restrain the company from paying.any
such dividend upon the unpreferred stock. Proofs were
taken and the parties having been heard the court entered
a decree for the respondents, dismissing the bill of complaint.
Evidence was introduced showing that all the parties understood the transaction, from its commencement to its final
consummation, as it is understood by the respondents, but
it is insisted by the complainant that such evidence is inadmissible, as its tendency is to explain and qualify what is in
writing, and the court is inclined to concur with the complainant in that proposition. Such evidence cannot be admitted in the case except for the purpose of connecting the
several written instruments together, and of showing that

Opinion of the court.

they are all parts of one transaction ; nor is it admitted that
the evidence is necessary in this case, even for that purpose,
as the instruments themselves contain the most persuasive
evidence to establish that fact, and inasmuch as it appears
that they were all introduced, either by the complainant or
by the responddnts, without objection, they are properly before the court. Such being the fact it is quite clear that
they must all be regarded as instruments in parimateria,and
that as such they are the proper subjects of consideration in
order to ascertain aid determine what is the true nature of
the transaction and the true construction of the contract between the parties. All of these writings were executed as
means to the same end, which was to enable the company
to find relief from the impending dangers and great embarrassments with which they and all interested in their affairs
were surrouuded. They could command nothing, nor were
the bondholders in much better condition, as a foreclosure
would not, in all probability, accomplish much except to
sacrifice the interests of all concerned. Everything con-nected with the enterprise was in jeopardy except the interest of the State, whose loan of $3,000,000 was secured-by a
first mortgage, covering the franchise, road-bed, and all the
rolling stock of the company, whose lands, franchise, roadbed, and other property were also incumbered by the other
three mortgages before mentioned, amounting to $8,000,000.
No attempt was made to negotiate with the State, but the
relief sought was obtained by the arrangement with the
holders of the bonds issued by the company, and which were
secured by the three mortgages aforesaid which were subject to the mortgage given to the State, as follows: (1.)
Holders of bonds under the first of the three mortgages
were to surrender 30 per cent. of their bonds and all their
unpaid coupols, and to accept preferred stock for the amount.
(2.) Persons holding bonds under the second mortgage were
to surrender 40 per cent. of'theii' bonds and all their unpaid
coupons, and they were to accept preferred stock as stipulated in the indenture. (3.) Those holding bonds under the
third mortgage were to surrender the whole of. their bonds

BAILEY V. RAILROAD COMPANY.
Opinion of the court.

and unpaid coupons, and were to accept preferred stock for
both bonds and coupons.
Priority was thus secured by the bondholders over the unpreferred stock amounting to a lien, as against the holders
of the latter stock, for a yearly dividend of 7 per cent., if
the net earnings of the road were sufficient for that purpose,
as conceded by both parties. Prior stockholders yielded
them that preference, but they insist that no just construction of the contract will give them any more in an one
year until the net earnings of the road will also give to the
holders of the unpreferred stock a dividend for the same
amount, and the court is inclined to adop't the same conclusion.
Test the question by the circular addressed to the bondholders, which they all signed as the preliminary step to the
arran gement, and the inquiry is too clear for argument, as
the statement is 'that the prefe~red stock shall "be 7 per
cent., not cumulative, but to share with the common stock
any surplus which may be carried over and above 7 per cent.
upon Loth in any one year," which means, as plainly as language can express the idea, that the preferred stock shall
share in the surplus arising from the net earnings of the
company, in any one year, beyond what is necessary to pay
a dividend to the whole stock, preferred and unpreferred, of
7 per cent. Nothing more favorable could be expected by
the bondholders, as they signed the circular and agreed to
surrender the number of bonds set against their respective
names and to receive in exchange therefor new bonds and
preferred stock in accordance with the provisions of the plan
for extricating the company from their present difficulties
and for improving their securities, showing that their attention had been called to the plan and that they were satisfied
with its terms and conditions.* Beyond doubt the directors
understood the matter in the same way, as they invested the
committee, which they appointed, with the power to make
such expenditures as to them should seem discreet to carry

Opinion of the court.

out the plan, which was sent to all the bondholders for their
approval.
Suppose that is so, still it is insisted that the indenture is
the only evidence of the contract between the parties, but it
is too late to advance that proposition, as all the other instruments are before the court Without objection, and several of them were introduced by the complainant as exhibits
to the bill of complaint. Seasonable objections, however,
could not have availed the complainant if they had been
made, as it is well-settled law that several writings executed
between the same parties substantially at the same time and
relating to the same subject-matter may be read together as
forming parts of one transaction, nor is it necessary that the
instruments should in terms refer to each other if in point
of fact they are parts of a single transaction.* Until it appears that the several writings are parts of a single transaction, either from the writings themselves or by extrinsic
evidence, the case is not brought within the rule, as it may
be that the same parties may have had more than one transaction in one day of the same general nature. Doubt upon
that subject, however, cannot arise in this case, as the due
relation of the several writings to each other is conceded by
both parties.t
Standing alone it may be admitted that the indenture furnishes some support to the views of the complainant, but it
is clear that all ambiguity disappears when it is read in connection- with the writings which preceded and followed it in
respect to the same subject-matter. Ample justification for
that remark is found in the plan which preceded it and
which was approved and signed by all the bondholders, and
in the form prepared for the certificate of the preferred stock
which was adopted subsequently to the execution of the indenture, and -which was accepted by all the holders of the
