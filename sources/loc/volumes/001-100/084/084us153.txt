HOMESTEAD COMPANY V. VALLEY RAILROAD.
1. In this case the court decides, for the fifth time, that neither the State of
Iowa nor any railroad company for whose benefit the act of Congress
of May 15th, 1856 (11 Stat. at Large, 9), was made, took any title to
the lands then claimed by the Des Moines Navigation and Railroad
Company, under what is known as the River Grant of August 8th, 1846
(6 Id. 77); and that the joint resolutioi of March 2d, 1861 (13 Id. 543),
and the act of July 12th, 1862 (12 Id. 25), on this subject transferred
the title from the United States and vested it in the State of Iowa for
the use of its grantees under the said River Grant.
2. Neither the railroad companies nor their grantees, as respected any lands
iranted by the said act of May 15th, 1856, or by the act of the legislatAre of Iowa, passed July 14th, 1856, were cestui que trustq of what are
called the Indemnity Lands, which were granted by the act of Congress
of July 12th, 1862; nor in view of the action of the officers of Iowa and
of the Federal government on the subject, and of the subsequent legislation of the said State and of Congress on it, were they entitled otherwise
to any portion of those lands.
& A party who has no title to lands cannot acquire one by mere payment
of taxes on them.
4. A party by paying taxes which another party ought to pay, but does not
pay, cannot make such second party his debtor by having stepped in and
paid the taxes for him, without being requested so to do.

"For the purpose of aiding said Territory to improve the
navigation of the Des Moines River, from its mouth to the Raccoon Fork, so called, in said Territory, one equal moiety, in
alternate sections, of the public lands, in a strip five miles in
width, on each side of said river."

The second section of this act provided that the lands so
granted should not be sold or conveyed by the Territory,
nor by any State to be formed out of it, except as the improvements progressed; that is, that sales might be nfade
so as to produce the sum of $30,000, and then cease until
the governor of the Territory, or State, as the case might
be, should certify to the President of the United States the
fact that one-half of this sum had been expended on said improvements, when sales again might be made of the remaining lands sufficient to replace this amount. The sales were
thus to progress as the proceeds were expended, and the dxpenditure so certified to the President.

Statement of the case.

"the river grant," the legislature incorporated the Des
Moines Navigation and Railroad Company, for the purpose of carrying out the improvement for which the lands
had been granted; and the lands, with some exceptions,
stated infra, page 157, were conveyed to that company.
Somewhere near the middle of the State, at Des Mvoines
City, the Des Moines River receives as a tributary a stream
called the Raccoon Fork. It thus happens that about onehalf the river is above the point where this fork enters and
one-half below. Each half traverses, of course, a region of
great extent and value.
From the phraseology of the above-quoted grant of Congress, it is obvious that a controversy was susceptible of
being raised; the point open to question being, whether
Congress meant to grant to the State land on the Des Moines
River above the point where the Raccoon Fork enters, as
well as the land below this point, or whether it meant to
grant only land below. On the one hand, the grant was for
the purpose of improving the navigation of the river "from
its mouth TO the Raccoon Fork." On the other, the grant
itself was of one equal moiety, &c., "on each side of the said
river."
As early as February, 1848, a controversy assumed form:
and what was the true meaning of the grant was a question
which came before a succession of officers of the United
States, commissioners of the land office, secretaries of the
treasury, secretaries of the interior, and attorneys-general.
Some of these thought that the grant did not extend above
e fork. Others, including Mr. A. H. Stuart, Secretary of
the Interior (the department to which the subject primarily
belonged), was of the opinion that it did, and certified the
lands above as though that were the true construction of the
grant.
The agents of the State, who had been appointed by the
governor to select the sections designated by odd numbers,
selected them from the mouth of the river towards the
northern boundary of the State as far as surveyed; in other
words, above the fork as well as below.

156

HOMESTEAD COMPANY V. VALLEY RAILROAD.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

On the 15th of May,.1856, Congress, by act of that date,*
granted to the State of Iowa, for the purpose of aiding in
the construction of certain railroads specified (including the
Dubuque and Pacific'Railroad), every alternate section of
land for six sections in width on each side of said roads.
Standipg without any restriction, this grant, as the road
named was laid out, would have embraced certain tracts
which, if the act of the 8th of August, 1846, rightly construed did include tracts above-the fork, had been granted
under'that act for the improvement of the navigation of the
Des Moines River. But the grant did not stand without
restriction. On the contrary, it contained a reservation,
thus:
"CProvided,that any and all lands heretofore reserved to the
United States by any act of Congress, or in any other manner by
competent authority, for the purpose of aiding in any object of
internal improvement, or for any other purpose whatsoever, be,
and the same are ,bereby, reserved to the United States from the
operation of this act, except so far as it may be found necessary
to locate the routes of said railroads through such reserved
lands, in which case the right of way only shall be granted,
subject to the approval of the President of the United States."
If, therefore, Mr. Stuart and the Department of the Interior, and the officers of the Federal government, who had
acted on the idea that the grant included lands above the
fork, and reserved them to the United States for the purpose
of aiding the improvement of the Des Moines River, were
"competent authority," within the meaning of this act, then
to whomsoever else they passed or did not pass, those lands
did not pass to the State under this act of May 15th, 1856,
for the benefit of its.railroads. But herein, again, it is obvious was a field for controversy.
Whatever the reservation or proviso to the act might
mean, the State of Iowa, by act of July 14th, 1856, accepted
the act and, without describing any lands particularly, enacted that the lands granted by the act "are hereby disposed

of, granted, and conferred to and upon the Dubuque and
Pacific Railroad Company." After, this the lands were
treated by the railway company as belonging to it, and on
the 7th of April, 1863, the Commissioner of the General
Land Office and Secretary of the Interior approvedthese
specific lands to the railroad grant,, and they were certified
to the State on that day, as part of the railway grant. The
railway company now paid the taxes.
Hare then the two companies-the navigation company
on the one hand and the railroad company on the other
were put in antdgonism. A question to be decided was this,
"Did the grant of the 8th August, 1846, which was now
represented by the navigation company, pass lands above the
fork ?"
[To preserve, however, in a chronological order, the chain
of certain event liereinafter referred to, we will here, at the
apparent expense 6f unity of subject, mention that on ihe
22d of March, 1858, the legislature of Iowa, having sold a
portion of the lands granted by the act of August 8th, 1846,
and being about to convey certain other portions to the De'
Moines Navigation Company, granted, by an act, all the
residue of them, and "all lands and compensation which
may be given in extension, or in lieu of any portion thereof, by
the General Government, to the Keokuk, Fort Des Moines,-and
Minnesota Railroad Company (whose name was subsequently
chauged to the Des Moines Valley Railroad Company);' the
grant to become operative so soon as Congress shall assent
to or permit a diversion, or the title thereto shall become
ested in the State so as to be subject to a grant.*]
To come back, however, now, to the question about the
extent of the grant.
That question got before this court A. D. 1860, in The Dubt lue and -uezfic Railroad v. Litchfieldt where it was finally
decided that the grant carried nothing above the fork. This
question, therefore, was at an end. But it did not follow

from this that any of the lands above had passed to the railroad company under the act of the 15th May, 1856. That
was another question, and whether or not they had so passed
would depend on the effect of the proviso or reservation in
that act; a matter then as yet judicially unsettled.
As soon as the decision in The Dubuque and Pacific Railroad v. Litchfield, deciding that the navigation company,
under the grant of the 8th of August, 1846, took no lands
above the fork, was anhounced (which it was in 1860), Congress passed first a joint resolution,* and then an act,t to
counteract its effects.
The joint resolution, which bore date March 2d, 1861,
was thus:

"Resolved, &c., That all the title which the United States still
retain in the tracts of land along the Des Moines River and above
the mouth of the Raccoon Fork thereof, which have been certified
to said State improperly by the Department of the Interior as
part of the grant by act of Congress, approved August 8th, 1846,
and which is now held by bond fide purchasers under the State
of Iowa, be, and the same is hereby relinquished to the State of
Iowa."
The act of Congress, which was approved 12th of July,
i862, was thus:
"Be it enacted, That the grant of lands to the then Territory
of Iowa for the improvement of the Des Moines River, made by
the act of August 8th, 1846, is hereby extended so as to include
the alternate sections (designated by odd numbers) lying within
five -miles of said river, between the Raccoon 'Fork and the
northern boundary of said State. Such lands are to be held
and applied in accordance with the provisions of the original
grant, except that the consent of Congress is hereby given to
the application of a portion thereof to aid in the construction
of the Keokuk, Fort Des Moines, and Minnesota Railroad [subsequently called the Des Moines Valley Road], in accordance
with the provisions of the act of the General Assembly of the
State of Iowa, approved March 22d , 1858."T

The act then went on further to say:
"And if any of said lands shall have been sold or otherwise
disposed of by the United States, before the passage of this act,
excepting those released by the United States to the grantees
of the State of Iowa under the joint resolution of March 2d,
1861, the Secretary of the Interior is hereby directed to set apart
an equal amount of lands within said State, to be certified in
lieu thereof. Provided that if the said State shall have sold and
conveyed any portion of the lands lying within the limits of this
grant, the title of which has proved invalid, any lands which shall

be certified to said State, in lieu thereof, by virtue of the provisions of this act, shall inure to and be held as a trust fund for
the benefit of the person or persons respectively, vhose title
shall have failed as aforesaid."
This act having been passed, an agent of the State of
Iowa and the Commissioner of the General Land Office met,
and on an assumption that the lands above the fork meant
to be given by the act of Congress, July 12tb, 1862, for the
improvement of the Des Moines River, had been granted to
the Dubuque and Pacific Railroad Company by the act of
May 15th, -1856, agreed "that the United States had sold
and otherwise disposed of a certain quantity of land prior to
the passage of the said act [of July 12th, 1862], for which
the State was entitled to indemnity under the act aforesaid;"
and, entering into negotiations, finally made an adjustment
of things by which a large quantity of lands were certified to
"he State as indemnity for the lands which, upon the repre,-rntations of the agent of Iowa, the United States admitted
had been disposed of by it under the grant of May 15th,
1856, for railroad purposes. And this action of the commissioner, made May 21st, 1866, was approved by the Secretary
of the Interior on the next day.
Soon after this adjustment, that is to say, in the spring of
1867, this court, in the case of Wolcott v. Des 3Ioines Company,* decided that the lands which bad been reserved by
the action of so many principal officers of the United States,

the proviso in the act of May 15th, 1856, and decided again

the same thing in Des Moines Mavqation Company v. Burr,*
and yet again in HarrietBiley v. W. B. Wells, a case which
the reporter did not, in view of two previous decisions, think
it necessary to report.
As under each one of these "decisions the court decided
that the United States had not, by its act of the 15th of May,
1856, given anything away to the State for the benefit of its
rail rads which, even assuming that the act of the 8th of
August, 1,846, carried lands above the fork, would have belonged to the navigation company-or, as, in other words, it
decided that there was, so far as the act of May 15th, 1856,
was concerned, no ground for indemnity to the State of
Iowa for a lo s to the navigation company, the State was
now naturally pront to ratiry the action of its own agent and
of the Federal officers, who had acted on a diffirent supposition of the efFect of the proviso or reservation; and on the
31st of March, 1868, the State, accordingly, by act of legislature, did ratify and confirm their action.
Congress' equally, on the 3d of March, 1871, notwithstanding the decisions above mentioned, by act of the date just
mentionedt enacted:
"That the title' to the land certified to the State of Iowa by
the Commissioner of the General Land Office, unde'r the act of
July 12th, 1862, in accordance with the adjustment made by the
authori ed agent of the State of Iowa and the Commissioner

31st, 1868, be, and the same is ratified and confirmed to the State
of Iowa and its grantees, in accordance with said adjustment and
said act of te General Assembly of the State of Iowa."
Thus, as'the reader will perceive, the'summing up of
everything, {cluding all the legislation, and 'all the decisions, ended with these results:

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.
This case presents another phase of the Des Moines River
land litigation.
The main question involved in this case is the question of
title to the Des Moines River lands, which was settled several years ago by the decision in the cases of Wolcott and
Burr,* and in the subsequent and unreported case of Riley
v. Wells, adversely to the title set up by the appellants. At
the present term of this court, the principles involved in
these decisions have been reconsidered and reaffirmed. t It
is therefore no longer an open question that neither the
State of Iowa nor th railroad companies, for whose benefit
the grant of 1856 was made, took any title by that act to
the. lands then claimed to belong to the Des Moines River
grant of 1846, and that the joint resolution of 2d of March,
1861, and act of 12th of July, 1862, transferred the title from
the United States and vested -itin the State of Iowa for the
use of its grantees under the river grant. If so, the claim
of title by the appellants, who are grantees under one of
these railroad companies, to the lands certified to the State
of Iowa, under the act of August 8tb, 1846, above the Raccoon Fork of the Des Moines River, has no foundation to
rest upon.
But the appellants insist if they cannot recover these lands
they are cestui que trusts for a portion of the indemnity lands
obtained by the State under the act of July 12th, 1862.
Congress by this act extended the grant originally made to
the State in 1846, for the irnprovement of the Des Moines
River, so as to include the alternate sections of land (designated by odd numbers) between the Raccoon Fork and the
northern boundary of the State, and consented that a portion
of these lands should be applied to the construction of a railroad, whicb, by change of name, is called the Des Moines
Valley Road.
This legislation was intended to put the State in exactly
the position it would have been, if there had been no dis*5

Opinion of the court.

pute as to the extent of the grant in 1846, and accordingly
the Secretary of the Interior was directed if any of the lands
within the granted limits should have been sold or otherwise disposed of by the United States before the passage of
the act, to set apart an equal quantity elsewhere in the State
in lieu thereof.
In case the State also had sold and conveyed any of these
lands, the title to which had proved invalid, the act directed
that the land set apart by the Secretary of the Interior should
be held in trust for the benefit of those persons whose titles
had thus failed. This latter provision was rendered necessary by the conflict in opinion which had for a series of
years existed concerning this river grant. The State had
always maintained that the original grant, properly construed, extended above the Baccooii Fork, while on the
contrary, the United States had at different times both denied and admitted the claim of the State. It was to be expected in this condition of the dispute that both the State
and General Government bad disposed of a portion of these
lands. If so, and the title of the grantees of the State had
proved invalid, it was eminently proper that they should be
protected, and there was no better way to do this than to
require the State, in the first instance, to use the indemnity
lands for this purpose.
It is admitted in the record that the State has conveyed
to the Des Moines Valley Railroad Company, one of the defendants in this suit, for good ahd valuable considerations
performed by the company, all the lands received by the
State under the act in question, except those only which
had been conveyed by the State under the act of August
8th, 1846, and the legislation pursuant thereto.
The inquiry arises, whether the State, at the time of the
passage of the act of 12th of July, 1862, had conveyed to
the grantor of the appellants any portion of the lands lying
within the river grant. If not, they are not within the purview of the act, for they have not suffered any loss by reason
of any transaction with the State, and are, therefore, not in
a position to claim compensation. The Iowa legislature, by

164

Opinion of the court.

the act of July 14tb, 1856, conveyed to the Dubuque and
Pacific Railroad Company, the grantor of the appellants, the
lands granted to the State by the act of Congress of May
15th, 1856. The conveyance did not specify any particular
lands, but in a general way transferred to the company
all the rights and interests which the State received from
the United States under this grant. It; therefore, the river
lands were not granted to the State by the act in question,
-they were not embraced in the conveyance which the State
made to the company, and the State, therefore, has not
broken its engagement with the company. This court having decided and reaffirmed the decision that the grant of
1856 did not include the lands claimed by the State to belong to the river improvement, it is difficult to see on what
grounds the appellants can rest their right to indemnity
under the act of July 12th, 1862, for they cannot be cestui
que trusts, as they never had any title which has proved invalid.
But the appellants insist if they are not the holder of any
titles which have failed within the meaning of the act of
July 12th, 1862, they are, nevertheless, entitled to a portion
of the indemnity lands certified to the State under that act,
because they were certified upon the assumption that the
river lands had been granted by the act of May 15th, 1856.
It is undoubtedly true that in 1866, on this theory, the State
of Iowa, through its authorized agent, made an adjustment
with the Commissioner of the General Laud Office, by which
a large quantity of lands were certified to the State, as indemnity for the lands which it was claimed had been disposed of by the United States by the grant for railroad purposes in 1856. It is equally true that the construction by
these officers of the different acts of Congress relating to this
subject, by which this result was obtained, was erroneous,
as we have held in three different cases. But the decision
in Wolcott's case, the first of the three, was not then alnounced, and the adjustment was doubtless induced by the
decision in Litchfield's case, that the river gr'ant did not extend above the Raccoon Fork. Whatever may have caused

COMPAN1Y V. VALLEY RAILROAD. 165"

Opinion of the court.

the adjustment, it is quite apparent, as the lands were erroneously certified under the act of July, 1862, that something
more was needed than the action of the laud commissioner,
fortified as it was by the approval of the Secretary of the
Interior, to pass a valid title to the State and its grantees.
That which was requisite to accomplish this object was obta-ined by the legislation of the State and of Congress. The
legislatbre of Iowa, in March, 1868, on the perfbrmadnce of
certain conditions, directed a conveyance to be made to thie
Des MNoines Valley Railrbad for all the lands embraced in
the act of Congress, approved the 12th of July, 1862, and
ratified the adjustment made with the Commissioner of the
General Land Office. In accordance with this legislation
the lands in controversy were patented by the State to the
company, the conditions imposed upon the c'rnpany before
this could be done having been complied with. Although
the ratification of the adjustment and the grant to the Valley Railroad would seem to be inconsistent acts, yet Congress, with full knowledge on the subject, on the 3d of
March, 187I, confirmed the title to the State and its grantees.
It is true the. law by which this is done, says it is in accordance with the adjustment, and the act of the General Assembly of Iowa, but, as we have seen, This act not only
ratified the adjustment, but also granted the lands to the
Valley Road.
Indeed, the main purpose of the act was to secure the
construction of the road, by the transfer to it of the lands
obtaine' under the adjustment. Whether the State of
Iowa in the disposition which it made of these lands, con-

formed to the adjustment, is not a question for us to consider.
This consideration was properly addressed to Congress,
who, with full knowledge that the legislature had parted
with the lands to the Valley Road, chose to confirm. the title
to " the State and its grantees."
If Congress had withheld its consent to what the State
had done, neither the State nor the'road would have taken
anything by the action of the officeys certifying the lands.

166

HOMESTEAD COMPANY V. VALLEY RAILROAD.

[SUp. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

This was also known to Congress, because the decision in
Wolcott's case was then before the country.
Congress, therefore, with full information that the State
of Iowa was not entitled to these indemnity lands by reason
of any previous legislation, thought proper, nevertheless, to
give them to the State, knowing at the time that they were
to be used in building a railroad along the line of the iDes
Moines River. It had already consented that a part of the
lands originally designed foi' the improvement of this river
by locks and dams, should be applied to the construction of
this road, and was doubtless induced to give the direction it
did to the indemnity lands, because it was satisfied that further aid was necessary td secure the completion of the Valley Road, while the east and west roads were either completed or nearly so. If we are correct in these views there.
isan end of this controversy, because Congress had the undoubted right to dispose of these lands for such purposes as
in its judgment might best subserve the public interests,
and having decided this question for itself, the Homestead
Company is not in a position to question the authority of
that decision. As the grant in 1856 did not cover the river
lands in place, this corporation is not within the terms of
the act of July 12th, 1862, and have, therefore, no rights
which either the State or Congress were bound to respect.
It must be concoded that its expectation to share in the
result of the adjustment concluded between the authorized
agent of the State and the land department of the General
Government was reasonable under the circumstances; but
this expectation was not founded on any- legal right, and
cannot, therefore, be the subject of judicial inquiry.
It seems that the appellants, during this litigation, paid
the taxes on a portion of these lands, and claim to be reimbursed for this expenditure in case the title is adjudged to be
in the defendants, on the ground that they paid the taxes in
good faith and in ignorance of the law. But ignorance of
the law is no ground for recovery, and the element of good
faith will not sustain an action where the payment has been
.voluntary, without any request from the true owners of the

land, and with a full knowledge of all the facts. It is an
elementary proposition, which does not require support from
adjudged cases, that one person cannot make another his
debtor by paying the debt of the latter without his request
or assent.
It is true, in accordance with our decision, the taxes on
these lands were the debt of the defendants, which they
should have paid, but their refusal or neglect to do this did
not authorize a contestant of their title to make them its
debtor by stepping in and paying the taxes for them, without being requested so to do. Nor can a request be implied
in the relation which the parties sustained to each other.
There is nothing to take the case out of the well-established
rule as to voluntary payments.

If the appellants, owing to

their too great confidence in their title, have risked too
much, it is their misfortune, but they are not on that account
entitled to have the taxes voluntarily paid by them refunded
by the successful party in this suit.

Mr. Justice MILLER took no part in this decision.

NOTE.

At the same time with the preceding was adjudged another,
Crilley v. Burrows, which the court said (Mr. Justice DAVIS

delivering the opinion) was "in no essential respect different
from it;" and had "no principle which had not already been
passed upon by this court in some one of the suits relating to
this protracted litigation." On this account it is no further reported.
