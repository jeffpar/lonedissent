gation will be endless. Litigants sometimes prefer not to bring
forward their whole case or defence, in order to enjoy the opportunity to bring up a' reserve in case of defeat in the first contest; but a rule which would sanction that practice would be
against public policy, as it would enable a party to protract the
litigation as long as he could find means or credit to compel the
attendance of witnesses and to secure the services of counsel.

JOHNSON v. HARMON.
1. A bill of exceptions cannot be taken on the trial of a feigned issue directed by
a court of equity, or, if taken, can only be used on a motion for a new trial
made to that court.
2. As the verdict may or may not have been the ground for the decree, an appeal
from the latter cannot be made to turn on the judge's rulings at the trial of
the feigned issue, but must be decided upon the whole case, pleadings, evidence, and verdict, giving to ihe latter as much effect as it is worth.

A1PPAL from the.Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Argued by Hr. A. C. Biddle for the appellant.
The court declined to hear Hr. M. Thompson for the appellee.

Mn. JusTicE BRADLEy delivered the opinion of the court.
This was a bill in equity, involving, amongst other questions,
the validity of a trust deed given by the complainant (the 'appellee here) to secure certain notes. The complainant charges
in his bill that he was so intoxicated when he executed the
deed and notes as to be incapable of understanding what he
was doing. The court below, after considerable testimony had
been taken, directed an issue to- try the question whether the
complainant, at the time of the execution of the deed of trust
and noes, was capable of executing a valid deed or contract.
The issue so directed was tried, and resulted in a verdict for the
complainant; namely, that he was not capable of executing a
valid deed or contract. The defendants took a bill of exceptions to the charge given by the judge who tried the issue,
which was allowed, and signed by him. The. ause afterwards

JOHNSON V. HAR410N.

[Sup. Ct.

came on to be heard upon the exceptions, and they were overruled. Subsequently a final hearing was had upon the pleadings, evidence, and verdict, and a decree was rendered for the
complainant, directing the trust deed and notes in question to
be vacated and set aside. From that decree this appeal was
taken, and the only errors assigned are to the charge given by
the judge to the jury on the trial of the feigned issue.
This is totally inadmissible. A bill of exceptions cannot be
taken on the trial of a feigned issue directed by a court of
equity, or, if taken, can only be used on a motion for a new
trial made to said court. 2 Dan. Ch. Pr. (3d Am. ed.) 1106;
Armstrong v. Armstrong, 3 Myl. & K. 52; Ex parte Story,
12 Pet. 343. See the cases on new trials on feigned issues collected in 3 Graham & Waterman on New Trials, 1553, &c.
The issue is directed to be tried for the purpose of informing
the conscience of the Chancellor, and aiding him to come to a
proper conclusion. If he thinks the trial has not been a fair
one, or for any other reason desires a new trial, it is in his discretion to order it. But he may proceed with the cause though
dissatisfied with the verdict, and make a decree contrary thereto, if in his judgment the law and the evidence so requires. A
decree in equity, therefore, when appealed from, does not stand
or fall according to the legality or illegality of the proceedings
on the trial of a feigned issue in the cause; for the verdict may
or may not have been the ground of the decree. It is the duty
of the court of first instance to decide (as was done here) upon
the whole case, pleadings, evidence, and verdict, giving to the
latter so much effect as it is worth. An appeal from the decree
must be decided in the same way, namely, upon the whole
case, and cannot be made to turn on the correctness or incorrectness of the judge's rulings at the trial of the feigned issue.
-Decreeaffirmed.
Mn. JUSTIcE CLuTo D concurred in the judgment of the
court, and delivered the following opinion: Difficulty attends the effort to define, with clearness and
precision, what degree of mental unsoundness in a grantor is
sufficient, in contemplation of law, to render him incapable of
giving a valid and effectual deed of conveyance. Confirmed

Oct. 1876.]

JOHNSON V. HARMON.

insanity which deprives a person of mental capacity to distinguish between right and-wrong, in respect to the act in question, renders the person irresponsible for such an act, though
criminal, and disqualifies him to enter into a contract or to execute a valid instrument to convey real or personal estate.
Deeds made by such a person are at least voidable; but niere
weakness of understanding is not of itself any objection to the
validity of a contract, if the capacity remains to see things in
their true relations, and to form correct conclusions in respect
to the subject-matter of the contract.
Men of such understanding are held responsible for criminal
acts, and they may make valid contracts; but when it appears
that a contractor or grantor has not strength of mind and reason sufficient to understand the nature and consequences of his
act in making a contract or in executing a deed, the instrument
may be avoided, on the ground of the mental incapacity of the
party to contract or to execute the conveyance.
Both minds must meet in such a transaction; and if one is so
weak, unsound, and diseased that the party is incapable of understanding the nature and quality.of the adt to be performed,
or its consequences, he is -incompetent to assent to the terms
and conditions of the instrument, whether that state of his
mind was produced by mental or physical disease, and whether
it resulted from crdinary sickness, or from accident, or from
debauchery, or from habitual and protracted intemperance.
Dennett v. Dennett, 44 N. H. 535; 2 Kent, Corn. (12th ed.) 45.
Enough appears to show thai; the 'complainant owned lot
numbered twenty-six, described in the record, with the two
dwelling-houses erected thereon ; that on- the d. of February,
1871, he indorsed two notes of that date, each for the sum of
three hundred dollars, payable one in five and the other in six
months from date, with ten per cent interest, to the o.er of
the first-named respondent; and that he, on the same day, executed and delivered to the other respondent a. deed of conveyance of the houses and lot in trust to suffer and permit the
complainant to occupy and enjoy the premises until some
default made in the payment of those two promissory notes,
with power in the trustee, in case of default of payment, to
proceed, on the request of the payee of the notes, to sell the

JOHNSON V. HARMON.

[Sup. Ot.

premises. Default of payment of the first note was made, and
complainant alleges, in his original bill of complaint, that the
trustee threatens to sell the premises. Subsequently he, by
leave of court, filed an amended bill of complaint.
Reference will only be made to the amended bill, as the
matters in controversy arose out of charges contained in that
pleading, -which are as follows: That when the complainant
executed the deed of trust and the notes he was so intoxicated
that he did not know what he was doing; that he did not know
that he was making his property liable for the notes, or that
he was incurring any obligation to pay the notes; that the
trustee, on the 21st of September last, sold the property at
public auction to the payee of the notes, and that he claims the
property as his own, and has given the complainant notice to
leave the premises.
Based upon these allegations, and others not necessary to be
reproduced, the complainant prays as follows: 1. That the
sale to the payee of the notes may be annulled and set aside.
2. That the trustee may be enjoined and restrained from
making any conveyance of the premises to any person. 3. That
if the trustee has made any conveyance of the same, that the
conveyance may be annulled and set aside. 4. That the deed
of trust may be decreed null and void. 5. That the payee of
the notes may be enjoined and restrained from taking possession, or in any way interfering with the premises or with the
complainant, or any tenant thereof, in the free use and enjoyment of the property; and for general relief.
Process was issued; and the first-named respondent appeared
and filed a separate answer, which consists of a denial of every
allegation of the bill of complaint, together with two affirmative averments: 1. That the complainant several times asked
for extension of time for the payment of the notes. 2. That
he, the respondent, saw no signs of intoxication in the complainant at the time the notes and deed of trust were executed,
and that he never set up any such pretence before the first note
was sued.
Proofs were taken, and it appears that the cause was submitted to the court upon the pleadings and evidence without
argument. Before decision, the court directed that a feigned

Oct. 1876.]

JOHNSON V. HARMON.

issue should be tried by a jury in the law court of the District,
as follows, to wit: whether or not the complainant at the time
the deed of trust and notes were executed was capable of executing a valid deed or contract.
I Pending that proceeding, the complainant filed in the
equity
court a sutiplemental bill, in which lie alleged that the jury
empanelled to try the feigned issue failed to agree, and that the
issue was still pending in the law court; that the payee of the
notes brought suit against him-before a justice of the peace to
obtain possession of the premises; that he recovered judgment
in the case, and that the present complainant.appealed the same
to the Supreme Court of the District; that the appellee in that
suit, notwithstanding the pendency of the feigned issue in the
court of law, caused the appeal from the judgment rendered by
the justice of the peace to be docketed and affirmed, without
evidence or inquiry into the merits. Wherefore he prayed that
the writ of possession might be annulled- and set aside, and for
an injunction.
Instead of that, the court first issued asummons commanding
the respondents to appear ancf answer the allegations of the
supplemental bill. Service beifig made, the first-named respondent appeared and filed an ans*er, -in which he admits that the
complainant did set up the defence of intoxication in the suit
on the note; that he, the present respondent, did obtain judgment for possession; but he avers that the appeal was never
perfected, and thatthe judgment of the justice of the peace was
affirmed. Hearing was had; and the court awarded an injunction restraining the respondent from interfering with the property, but requiring the complainant to give bond to pay rent, in
case the final decree should be in favor of the. respondent.
Those matters being adjusted, the parties went to trial upon
the feigned issue in the court of law, and the jury found that
the complainant at the time he signed the deed of trust and
notes was not capable of executing a valid deed or contract.
Exceptions were filed by the respondent as in a common-law
action, in which is given what purports to be the testimony
introduced in the trial of the issue.
Evidence was offered by the plaintiff tending to prove that
at and after the time of the making of the deed and notes, he,.

JOHNSON V. IHAR ON.

[Sup. Ct.

the plaintiff, was in the habit of using intoxicating liquors to
excess; that he was more or less under such stimulants all the
time; that at the date of the deed he had been drinking freely;
and the bill of exceptions shows that several witnesses testified
that they did not consider him fit to do business. Among
others, the makers of the notes secured by the deed of trust
were called, and they testified that they were present at the
making of the deed and notes; that the complainant was very
much intoxicated, so much so that they did not consider him
fit to transact business or capable of executing a deed or contract. Testimony to the same effect was given by another
witness who was also present when the deed and notes -were
executed.
Support to that theory, of a decided character, was also derived from the testimony of a physician, who testified that he
saw the party almost daily about that time, and "that he was
not competent ti contract it the time of making the deed," in
which statements he was confirmed by other witnesses called
during the trial.
Opposing evidence was introduced by the defendant. In the
first place, he called the trustee who prepared the deed and
notes, and he testified that the parties, including the makers of
the notes, came to his office to have the deed prepared; that
he informed him that he must have the title-deed of the plaintiff to obtain the 4escription of the premises; that the plaintiff
and the payee of the notes left his office for that purpose, and
returned with the title-deed; that he prepared 'he trust-deed,
read it over to the plaintiff, and explained it to him; that he
expressed himself satisfied with it, and signed it. He also called
the magistrate who took the acknowledgment of the grantor;
and both of these witnesses testified that they thought that the
grantor was -sober. Witnesses were also examined by the
defendant, whose testimony tended to prove that the plaintiff
said nothing of the deed being invalid because of his intoxication before the property was i old, and that he signed a paper
six weeks afterwards, agreeing to the assignmelit of the lease
for which th6 notes secured by the deed of trust were given.
Three exceptions were taken by the defendant to rulings of
the presiding justice in refusing to instruct the jury as requested,

Oct. 1876.]

JOHNSON V. HARMON.

as follows: 1. That, to set aside a deed or contract on account
of drunkenness, it is not sufficient that the party is under undue
excitement from liquor. It must rise to that degree which may
be called excessive drunkenness, where the party is utterly
deprived of his reason and understanding. 2. That the jury
must find for the defendants, unless they believe that the plaintiff was in such a state of intoxication as not to know what he
was doing when he signed the deed in controversy. 3. That,
if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff knew
that he was signing a deed of trust upon his property, they
must find for the defendant.
By the record, it appears that the judge held that if the word
"utterly" in the first prayer as here reported was intended to
express an entire loss of reason in all respects, it was not good
law; but if it meant that the defendant must be incapable of
understanding the terms and conditions of the deed of trust, in
order to avoid it, then it was good law; and, so modified, the
instruction was given to the jury. That the other two requests
were granted subject to the following modification: that it was
not sufficient to make the deed a-valid one for the plaintiff to
know that he was signing a deed of trust on his property; but
he must have been in'such a condition of mind as to be able to
know and understand the terms and condition of the deed.
That it is not necessary, in order to render the deed of thu
plaintiff invalid, that, at the time of its execution and acknowledgment, he was entirely demented by intoxicating drink; but
his act will be rendered invalid if he was in such a condition
of mind that he could not comprehend what were the terms and
condition of the instrument.
Subsequently the parties were heard on the exceptions in
the equity court, and the exceptions were overruled. Neither.
party moving for a rehearing or a new trial, the cause came up
for consideration in the Supreme Court of the District, and the
court affirmed the decree of the Chancellor, overruling the
exceptions of the defendant to the 'rulings of the justice presiding at the trial before the jury.
All interlocutory matters having been disposed of, the cause
came on to be heard upon the original bill, the amended and
supplemental bills, the answers of the respondent, the verdict

JOHNSON V. HARMON.

[Sup. Ct.

of the jury, the decree in general term overruling the exceptions
to the ruling of the justice in the trial of the feigned issue; and,
upon consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed
that the deed of trust and the indorsements of the complainant
on the notes are hereby vacated, annulled, and set aside, and
for the other relief, as more fully set forth in the interlocutory
decree exhibited in the record, which was in all things affirmed
by the final decree of the Supreme Court of the District, from
which the respondent appealed to this court.
Erroneous rulings of the judge presiding in the trial of
feigned issues are the proper subject of a motion for new trial
before the Chancellor who formed the issues and sent them to
the law court for trial, but they do not of themselves constitute
a ground of appeal to this court. Appeals here can only be
sustained where the decree is final, and such an appeal brings
up the whole case. Where exceptions are taken on the trial
of an issue out of chancery, and made part of the record, the
certificate to the verdict by the court of law is a certificate to
the whole record, and the exceptions, though not expressly
certified, become a part of the chancery record. 2 Dan. Ch.
Pr. (4th Am. ed.) 1120; WFatkins v. Carlton, 10 Leigh, 560.
Issues of the kind are directed to be had at law, to inform
the conscience of the Chancellor as to doubtful facts in controversy. Hardingv. Handy, 11 Wheat. 125; Goodyear v. Rubber
Company, 2 Cliff. 851.
Power to grant a new trial of the issues is unquestionably
vested in the Chancellor; but, in determining that matter,
the practice is to consider the whole of the evidence given at
or before the trial and what has since become known to the
courtl and the rule is, that if the court is satisfied that full and
complete justice has been done between the parties, the motion
for new trial will be denied. 2 Dan. Ch. Pr. 1121; Patterson
v. Acekerson, 1 Edw. Ch. 102.
Applications for new trial in an issue sent out of chancery
must be made to the court of chancery, after the proceedings
are certified back from the court of law. 1 Barb. Ch. Pr. (2d
ed.) 456; Van Alst v. Hunter, 5 Johns. Ch. 153; Birdsall v.
Patterson, 51 N. Y. 43.
Such an issue is directed, as before remarked, to inform the

Oct. 1876.]

JOHNSON V. HARMON.

conscience of the Chancery Court, and the application for new
trial must be made to the Chancellor; nor will the Chancellor
grant a new trial for every error of the judge presiding at the
trial of the issues, if, on the whole iacts, he is satisfied that
the result is correct. Apthorp v. Comstock, 2 Paige, 486-488 ;
Silsby v. Foote, 20 How. 385; ( laz yton v. Garrington,88 Barb.
145.
Instructions given in the trial of such an issue are not the
proper subject of appeal to this court, the rule being that this
court can only examine the final decrees of the equity court.
Brockett v. Brockett, 8 How. 691; McLaughlan v. Bank, 7 id.
227.
Suppose that is so, still it is insisted by the appellant that
the evidence reported in the record is sufficient to show that
the final decree of the court below is erroneous.
Imbecility of mind is not of itself sufficient to set aside a
contract, when there is not an essential privation of the reasoning faculties or an incapacity of understanding and acting with
discretion in the ordinary affairs of life. Weakness of understanding may be a material circumstance in every case where
the charge is that one of the contracting parties has taken
undue advantage of the other, or has been guilty of unfair
practice or imposition. Formerly, it was considered that intoxication was no excuse for the non-fulfilment of a pecuniary
liability, and that it constituted no sufficient plea in avoidance
of a contract; bat it is now settled, says Chancellor Kent,
according to the dictate of good sense ana common justice,
that a contract made by a person so destitute of reason as not
to know the consequences of his contract, though his incompetency be produced by intoxication, is at least voidable. 2 Kent,
Com. (12th ed.) 451.
Much consideration was given to that question in the case of
Barret v. Burton, 2 Aik. (Vt.) 167, and it was there decided
that an obligation executed by a man deprived of the exercise
of his understanding, by intoxication, was voidable by himself,
though the intoxication was voluntary and not procured by
the circumvention of the other party. Young v. Stevens, 48
N. H. 136.
Other courts and text-writers of the highest authority adopt

JOHNSON V. HARMON.

[Sup. t

that view, and support the proposition without qaalification,
except where the contract was for necessaries, or where the
intoxicated party keeps the goods and uses the same as his own
property after he becomes sober. It appears to have been at
one time considered, says Chitty, that an agreement was not
void even in equity, although it was entered into by the party
charged thereon while he was in a state of absolute intoxication,
unless such intoxication had been occasioned by the contrivance
of the other party, or some positive fraud had been practised;
but it would seem, says the"author, that, on principle, such a
degree of intoxication as entirely deprives a party of the use of
his reason must avoid an engagement entered into by him
while in that state, even although it was produced. by his own
folly, and although no actual fraud was intended or practised;
giving the same reason for the conclusion given at a much
earlier period, that "such a person had no agreeing mind,"
which of itself is sufficient to show that the intoxicated man
cannot be held bound to the alleged contract. Chitty on Contr.
(10th ed.) 137; Pitt v. Smith, 3 Camp. 33; Fenton v. Holloway,
I Stark. 126.
Beyond doubt, these authorities support the proposition
advanced; and the same writer adds, that it is now settled that
where a party, when he enters into a contract, is in such a
state of intoxication as not to know what he is doing, and particularly when it appears that this was known to the other
party, his contract is at least voidable. Matthews v. Baxter,
Law Rep. 8 Exch. 132; Molton v. Camroux, 2 Exch. 501.
When intoxication goes so far as absolutely to destroy the
reason, it is evident that it renders the person in that state
incapable of contracting so long as it continues, since it renders
him incapable of giving consent. 1 Poth. on Obl., by Evans,
p. 29.
Modern text-writers treat of contracts with intoxicated persons under a distinct head; and Addison says, that a party who
makes a contract in such a state of intoxication as not to know
what he is doing, cannot be compelled to perform the contract
by the other party who knew him to be in that state, and that
a man who takes an obligation from another so circumstanced
is guilty of actual fraud. Examples are given which support

Oct. 1876.]

- JOHNSON V. HARM oN.

the proposition; but the author holds that a contract made by
a man in a state of intoxication is voidable 'only and not void,
and therefore the intoxicated man may, if he pleases, when he
becomes sober, ratify it, and that it will then be binding
Addison on Contr. (3d Am. ed.) 285.
Courts of justice in repeated instances have decided in the
same way. Reference will be made to a few such cases, with
the remark, that the number might be greatly increased.
Undoubtedly, said the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the
total drunkenness of the maker of a note when he executed it,
if known to the payee, rendered it void as to the latter; and
they remark, that the old rule that a man should be held liable
upon a contract made by him when in a state of intoxication,
on the ground that he should not be allowed to stultify himself,
has been long since exploded, and that it is now settled, according to the dictate of good sense and common justice, that a
contract made by a person so destitute of reason as not to
know the consequences of his contract, though his incompetency be produced by intoxication, is void as between the parties. Bank v. McCoy, 69 Penn. St. 207.
Except where the contract is for necessaries, the Court of
Exchequer held, that where the right of action is grounded
upon a specific, distinct contract, requiring the assent of both
parties, and one of them is incapable of assenting, as in consequence of intoxication, in such a case there can be no binding
contract. Parke, B., said, where the party, when he entered
into the contract, -was in such a state of drunkenness as not to
know what he is doing, and particularly when it appears that
this was known to the other party, the contract is void
altogether, and he cannot be compelled to perform it; adding,
that a person who takes an obligation from another under such
circumstances is guilty of actual fraud. Gore v. Gibson, 13
M. & W. 625.
In regard to drunkenness, says Greenleaf, it is now settled
that incapacity from that cause is a valid defence to an action
upon the contract made while under its influence, as well where
it was voluntary and by the fault of the defendant as -where
it was caused by the fraud or procurement of the plaintiff.
2 Greenl. Evid. (12th ed.) sect. 374.

BEALL V. WHITE.

[Sup. Ct.

Whether the intoxication was so great as to suspend or
destroy the power of intelligent assent, is a question of fact
Nor does it make any difference that the drunkenness was voluntary and wiLful, for the legal theory is, that, without the
capacity of giving a deliberate assent, no contract can be made.
Story on Contr. (5th ed.) 86. But the author adds, that intoxication only renders the contract voidable, not void; so that the
party intoxicated may, upon recovering his understanding, adopt
it, when it will become obligatory. Reinskoyf v. -Rugge, 37
Ind. 207.
Contracts of the kind are voidable only, not void, and therefore capable of being ratified when the party becomes sober.
Molton v. Camroux, 2 Exeh. 501; MJfatthews v. Baxter, Law
Rep. 8 Exch. 132.
Apply these rules to the facts of the ease as disclosed by the
proofs, and it is clear that there is no error in the record.

BEALL v. WHmTE.
1. Under the act of Congress approved Feb. 22, 1867 (14 Stat. 403), the lien of
a landlord for rent has priority over a deed of trust made by his tenant
after the commencement of the tenancy, whether the chattels covered by the
deed were, when it was executed, upon the demised premises, or were subsequently acquired and placed by the tenant upon them.
2. A statutory lien attaching to personal chattels, although no possession of them
be delivered, has the same operation and efficacy as existed at common law,
where the possession accompanied and followed the deed creating the ien.
8. It is only where no rule of law is infringed, and the rights of third persons are
not prejudiced, that courts of equity will, in certain cases, give effect to
mortgages of subsequently acquired property.
4. A surrender to a landlord is effected either by words manifesting the intention
of the lessee to yield up his estate, or by operation of law, where the parties,
without such words, do some act which implies that they both agree to consider the surrender as made.
5. In this case, the court holds that there was no surrender, either express or by
operation of law.
