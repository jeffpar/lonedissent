to enable a court to obtain further information in respect to
some matter already before it for adjudication. It is for the
last purpose only that the writ is employed in this court.
In the present case the writ is asked, not to bring here any
part of the record of the Court of Claims as it existed when the
appeal was taken, but to obtain a new record of a new proceeding which has been bad since, and by which the judgment
appealed from has been vacated and a new trial granted in the
court below. The object is to inform us, not of what was done
before the appeal, but of what has been done since. Our action
under the appeal, however, is confined to what was done before;
and, if we act at all upon what has been done since, it must be
in consequence of some new jurisdiction to be acquired. From
what has already been said, it is clear that, for such a purpose,
we have no power to issue the writ.
The Court of Claims, by granting a new trial, has resumed
control of the cause and the parties. This it had the right to
do. Such a power may be somewhat anomalous, but it is
expressly given; and every person, when he submits himself to
the jurisdiction of that court for the prosecution of his claim,
subjects himself to its operation. The proceedings under which
the new trial was obtained are now a part of the record below,
and, after judgment is finally rendered, may be brought here
by appeal for review.
Notion of the United States to dismiss the appeal granted.

Towx OF SOUTH OTTAwA v. PERxINs.
SUPERVISORS OF KENDALT COUNTY v. POST.
1. The Supreme Court of Illinois, by a long course of decisions, has held that,
under the Constitution of 1848, a statute of that State is not valid unless the
legislative journals show that it was passed by a majority of all the members elect in each house of the general assembly.
2. Except where the Federal Constitution and laws are concerned, the courts of
the United States, in passing upon the Constitution and statutes of a State,
conform to the settled construrtion of them by the highest State court;

and, when the latter holds a pretended act of the lgislature to be void and
not a law, the courts of the United States are bound to hold accordingly.
Any State may, by its Constitution and laws, prescribe what shall be conclusive evidence of its statutes; but, on general principles, the question as
to the existence or non-existence of a statute is a judicial one, and, though
framed in form as ah issue in fact, must, when it arises in the courts of the
United States, be decided by them, on evidence legally applicable under the
laws of the State, without taking the advice of a jury on the subject.
A municipal corporation cannot, without legislative authority, issue bonds in
aid of an extraneous object. Every person dealing in them must, at his
peril, take notice of the existence and terms of the law which, it is claimed,
conferred the power to issue them, no matter under what circumstances he
may obtain them.
The plaintiffs in error, municipal corporations in Illinois, having issued the
bonds in suit, by virtue of a pretended act of the general assembly, approved
Feb. 18, 1857, which was duly published among the printed statutes of that
State as a law, and, therefore, prima fade valid, were not estopped from
denying its passage, notwithstanding the holder of the bonds was a boaafide
purchaser without actual notice.
The Supreme Court of Illinois has decided, in two cases, that that act was
never passed, and is not an act of the legislature of that State. This court
concurs in that view, and also holds that no subsequent legislation has given
any new force to the act, or any validity to the bonds issued, or the proceed.

The act of Congress, prescribing the mode in which the public acts, records,
and judicial proceedings in each State shall be authenticated, so as to take
effect in every other State, has no bearing upon this case.

ERon to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern District of Illinois.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Argued by Mr. P. _Phillips and Mr. T. Z'yle Dickey for the
plaintiffs in error, by Mr. C. S. -Eldridgefor Perkins, and by
Mr. 1). T. hittler and Mr. H. Greene for Post.
MR. JUSTICE BADLEYi delivered the opinion of the court.
The first of these actions was brought by Perkins, the plaintiff below, to recover the amount due upon two negotiable bonds
of the town of South Ottawa, in the usual form, for $1,000 each,
made payable to the Ottawa, Oswego, and Fox River Valley
Railroad Company, or bearer, in three years from July 1, 1869,

with coupons for the semi-annual payment of interest attached.
They each contained recitals as follows :
"This bond is one of a series of twenty bonds, bearing even date
herewith, each for the sum of $1,000,. . . and is issued in pursa.

ance of an election held in said town, on the eighth day of October,
1q66, under and by virtue of a certain act of the legislature of the
State of Illinois, approved Feb. 18, 1857, entitled ' An Act authorizing certain cities, counties, incorporated towns and townships to
subscribe to the stock of certain railroads,'

. . .

at which election a

majority of the legal voters participating in the same voted ' for
subscription' to the capital stock of said railroad in the sum of
820,OO, and to issue the bonds of said town therefor; and the said
election was by the proper authorities duly declared carried 'for
subscription,' previous application having been made to the townclerk of the town, and said clerk having called said election in accordance therewith, and having given-due notice of the time and place
of holding the same, as required by law and the act aforesaid."
The second action was brought on a bond issued by the
county of Kendall, in Illinois, bearing date the fourth day of
May, 1869, in aid of the same railroad, and by virtue of the
same act of the legislature, and containing substantially the
same recitals, mutatis rautandis,as those in the Ottawa bonds,
except that the election authorizing the issue of the bonds is
stated to have been held on the thirtieth day of March, 1869.
The facts in the two cases are, in other respects, substantially
the same.
The only authority claimed for issuing these bonds is the
act referred to in the above recital therein. If no such act was
ever passed by the legislature of Illinois, the bonds are void.
A municipal corporation cannot issue bonds in aid of extraneous objects without legislative authority, of which all persons
dealing with such bonds must take notice at their peril. Pendleton County v. Amy, 13 Wall. 297; Kenicott v. The Supervisors, 16 id. 452; St. Joseph Township v. Rogers, 16 id. 644;
Town of Coloma v. Eaves, 92 U.. S. 484.
It is insisted on the part of the plaintiffs in error in these
cases that the law relied on for authority to issue the bonds in
question was never passed, no entry of its passage appearing on
the journal of the Senate of Illinois.
The Constitution of Illinois, adopted in 1848, contains the
following provisions: " ART. 3, SECT. 1. The legislative authority of the State shall
be vested in a general assembly, which shall consist of a senate and
house of representatives, both to be elected by the people.'

Oct. 1876.]

TowN OF SOUTH OTTwA

v. PERKNS.

"SECT. 3. Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings,
and publish them...."
"SECT. 21.. . .On the final passage of all bills, the vote shall
be by ayes and noes, and shall be entered on the journal; and no.
bill shall become a liw without the concurrence of a majority of all
the members elect in each house."

The Constitution also provides that all bills passed shall be
signed by the speakers of the two houses, and approved and
signed by the governor, or, in case of his refusal, shall be repassed by a majority elected to each house. The general laws
of the State provide for depositing all acts of the legislature,
and the original journals of the two houses, in the office of the
Secretary of State, who is charged with having them printed;
and the printed statute-books are made evidence of the acts
contained therein.
In the construction of the constitutional provisions aboye
recited, the Supreme Court of Illinois, by a long course of
decisions, has held that it is necessary to the validity of a
statute that it should appear by the legislative journals that
it was duly passed in the manner required by the Constitution.
As early as 1853, it was decided, in Spangler v. Taco6y,
14 Ill. 297, that it was "competent to show from the journals
of either branch of the legislature that a particular act was
not passed in the mode prescribed by the Constitution, and
thus defeat its operation altogether. The Constitution requires
each house to keep a journal, and declares that certain facts,
made essential to the passage of a law, shall be stated therein.
If those facts are not set forth, the conclusion is that they did
not transpire. The journal is made up under the immediate
direction of the house, anid is presumed to contain a full and
complete history of its proceedings. If a certain act received
the constitutional assent of the body, it will so appear on the
face of its journal. And when a contest arises as to whether
the act was pass&Id, the journal may be appealed to to settle it.
It is the evidence of the action of the house, and by it the act
must stand or fall. 'It certainly was not the intention of the
framers of the Constitution that the signatures of the speakers
and the executive should furnish conclusive evidence of the pas-

TOWN OF SOUTH OTrAWA v. PEmNS.

[Sup. Ct.

sage of a law. The presumption, indeed, is, that an act thus
verified became the law, pursuant to the requirements of the
Constitution; but that presumption may be overthrown. If
the journal is lost or destroyed, the presumption will sustain the
law, for it will be intended that the proper entry was made on
the journal. But when the journal is in existence, and it fails
to show that the act was passed in the mode prescribed by the
Constitution, the presumption is overcome, and the act must
fall."
This case was followed,- in 1855, by Turley v. County of Logan, 17 id. 151. There, a law was supposed to have been passed
at the session of the legislature in 1853, for the removal of the
seat of justice of Logan County, by a vote of the people. In
the fall after, a vote was taken, which resulted in favor of the
removal. Turley and his associates then filed their bill to restrain the county officers from erecting county buildings at the
new location, on the ground that, as appeared by the journal,
the act had not been read in the House of Representatives the
full number of times required by the Constitution, and so was
no law. The fact being as alleged, the injunction was, in the
first instance, allowed, but afterwards, in February, 1854, the
same legislature met in extra session, and, on recollection of
members, and by the manuscript notes of the clerk, the House
of Representatives amended its journal so that it showed the
bill had been read the requisite number of times. Thereupon
the Supreme Court, when the case came there, while recognizing fully the authority of Spangler v. Jacoby, affirmed a decree
dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill, for the reason
that it was within "the power of the same legislature, at the
same or a subsequent session, to correct its own journals,
by amendments which show the true facts as they actually
occurred."
The same question was also considered by the same court
in Prescott v. The Trustees of the. illinois & Michigan Canal,
19 id. 324, decided in 1857. There, Prescott and Arnold were
entitled to purchase, at the appraised value, certain lots in Chicago, which had been appraised twice; and the point to be
decided was, whether they should pay according to the first or
second appraisal. The second appraisal was made under a

Oct. 1876.]

Town OF SOUTH OTTAWA V. PERKINS.

law supposed to have been passed Feb. 14, 1851, but which
the journals showed had never in fact passed either branch of
the general assembly. Accordingly, the court held, upon the
authority of Spangler v. Jacoby, that the second appraisal was
invalid, and that the parties had the right to purchase under
the first.
In the case of Mhe Supervisors of Schuyler Gounty v. The

rPeo-

ple, 25 id. 181, which came before the court in 1860, it was
objected that the Senate journal did nob show that the bill incorporating the railroad company was read three times in that body
before it was put on its final passage; but the court, while still
approving Spanglerv. Jacoby, held that,the Constitution did not
require the fact that the bill had been read three times to be
entered on the journals, and, consequently, that the validity of
the law could not be impeached on that ground.
In 1864, in the case of The People ex rel. Barnes v. &tdrne,

35 id. 121, an application was made for a mandamus to compel
the treasurer of the State to countersign, register, and pay a
warrant issued upon him in favor of Barnes, the relator, by the
auditor of public accounts. The warrant was issued upon the
authority of what was supposed to be a statute of Illinois,
approved Feb. 14, 1863, as compensation for transporting and
bringing home certain wounded soldiers belonging to the State;
but it being shown that the journal of the House of Representatives did not contain entries to the effect that the bill was
passed by a majority of the members elect, or that the vote
was taken by ayes and noes upon the final passage, the mandamus was refused. In the opinion of the court the authorities
are extensively reviewed, and the rulings in the previous cases
reaffirmed.
These cases were all decided before the issue of the bonds
sued on in this case. But since that time two cases have
arisen under the very law now in question, in which the
Supreme Court of Illinois has decided that it was never passed,
and is not an act of the legislature of that State. The first of
these cases Ryan v. Lynch, 68 id. 160, was decided in 1873.
Certain tax-payers of the town of Ottawa sought to enjoin the
tax-collector fr-om collecting a tax which had been levied to
pay interest upon bonds issued in aid of the Ottawa, Oswego,

TowN oF SOUTH OTTAWA V. PERKINS.

[Sup. Ct,

and Fox River Railroad Company, upon the ground that the
act under which the bonds were issued, that of Feb. 18, 1857
(the same which is now under consideration), had not been
enacted in conformity with the requirements of the Constitution. At the hearing in the court below it was proved that the
journal of the Senate did not show that the bill had ever passed
that body. Upon this proof, the court, recognizing the authority of Spangler v. Jacoby and other cases which followed it,
granted the injunction asked for. In the Supreme Court, on
appeal, it was insisted that the decree ought to be reversed,
because the bondholders had not been made parties. The
objection was overruled, and the action of the court below
affirmed.
Following this is the case of Miller & Paddock v. Goodwin,
7 Chicago Legal News, 294, not yet reported in the regular
series of the reports of the State. It being shown in this case,
as in Ryan v. Lynch, that the journals did not contain the
requisite evidence of the passage of the law, it was again
adjudged invalid. This was in January, 1875. An effort was
made in this last case to impeach the transcript of the legislative journals; but it was unsuccessful. The court repeated
what it had said in the case of Ryan v. Lynch, using this language: "The bill never became a law, and the pretended act
conferred no power. It follows that the bonds were not merely
voidable, but that they were absolutely void, for want of power
or authority to issue them; and consequently no subsequent
act or recognition of their validity could so far give vitality to
them as to estop the tax-payers from denying their legality."
This opinion, it is true, was delivered after the trial of the case
now before us. But it goes to show that, up to the very moment
of that trial, there had been no vacillation in the State court
as to the construction and effect of the Constitution of Illinois.
When the cases now under consideration came on for trial
in May, 1874, the defendants below offered to prove, by the
journals of each house of the legislature, that there was no
entry in the same of the passage by the Senate of the act of
Feb. 18, 1857. The testimony was objected to, and ruled out.
Substantially the same questions were raised by demurrer to
a plea. The ground of this decision seems to have been, that

Oct. 1876.]

TOWN OF SOUTH OTAwA v. PERKINS.

the holder of the bonds was a bona fide purchaser of them
without notice of any objection to their validity; that the first
instalment of interest was paid at maturity; and, therefore,
that the defendant was estopped from offering any evidence to
show that the act was not passed, the same having been duly
published among the printed statutes as a law, and being therefore primafadce a valid law: in other words, that although the
act might not have been duly passed, the town, under the circumstances of the case, was estopped from denying its passage.
We cannot assent to this view. There can be no estoppel in
the way of ascertaining the existence of a law. That which
purports to be a law of a State is a law, or it is not a law,
according as the truth of the fact may be, and not according to
the shifting circumstances of parties. It would be an intolerable state of things if a document purporting to be an act
of the legislature could thus be a law in one case and for one
party, and not a law in another case and for another party; a
law to-day, and not a law to-morrow ;-a law in one place, and
not a law in another in the same State. And whether it be a
law, -or not a law, is a judicial question, to be settled and
determined by the courts and judges. The doctrine of estoppel
is totally inadmissible in the case. It would be a very unseemly state of things, after the courts of Illinois have determined that a pretended statute of that State is not such, having
never beei constitutionally passed, for the courts of the United
States, with the same evidence before them, to hold otherwise.
It is declared by the Judiciary Act as a fundamental principle
"that the laws of the several States, except where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States shall otherwise
require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in
trials at common law in the courts of the United States in
cases where they apply." Sect. 34. And this court has always
held that the laws of the States are to receive their authoritative
construction from the State courts, except where the Federal
Constitution and laws are concerned; and the State Constitutions, in like manner, are to be construed as the State courts
construe them. This has been so often laid down as the proper
rule, and is in itself so obviously correct, that it is unnecessary
to refer to the authorities.

TOWN OF SOUTH OTTAwA v. PERKINS.

[Sup. Ct,

If, therefore, the law in question had never been passed upon
by the State courts, the courts of the United States would
nevertheless be bound to give to the Constitution of Illinois the
same construction which the State courts give to it, and to
hold a pretended act of the legislature void and not a law
which the State courts would hold to be so. Otherwise, we
should have the strange spectacle of two different tribunals,
having co-ordinate jurisdiction in the same State, differing as
to the validity and existence of a statute of that State, without
any power to arbitrate between them. In speaking, however,
of their jurisdiction as being co-ordinate, it is only meant that
one has no power to enforce its decisions upon the other. As a
matter of propriety and right, the decision of the State courts
on the question as to what are the laws of the State is binding
upon those of the United States.
But the law under consideration has been passed upon by
tb Supreme Court of Illinois, and held to be invalid. This
ought to have been sufficient t6 have governed the action of
the court below. In our judgment it was not necessary to
have raised an issue on the subject, except by demurrer to the
declaration. The court is bound to know the law without
taking the advice of a jury on the subject. When once it
became the settled construction of the Constitution of Illinois
that no act can be deemed a valid law, unless, by the journals
of the legislature, it appears to have been regularly passed by
both houses, it became the duty of the courts to take judicial
notice of the journal entries in that regard. The courts of
Illinois may decline to take that trouble, unless parties bring
the matter to their attention; but, on general principles, the
question as to the existence of a law is a judicial one, and must
be so regarded by the courts of the United States.
This subject was fully discussed in Gardnerv. The Collector.
After examining the authorities, the court in that case lays
down this general conclusion, "that whenever a question arises
in a court of law of the existence of a statute, or of the time
when a statute took effect, or of the precise terms of a statute,
the judges who are called upon to decide it have a right to
resort to any source of information which in its nature is capable of conveying to the judicial mind a clear and satisfactory

Oct. 1876.]

TowN oF SouTa OTTAwi v. PEimIs.

answer to such question; always seeking first for that which in
its nature is most appropriate, unless the positive law has
enacted a different rule." 6 Wall. 511.
Of course, any particular State may, by its Constitution and
laws, prescribe what shall be conclusive evidence of the existence or non-existence of a statute; but, the question of such
existence or non-existence being a judicial one in its nature,
the mode of ascertaining and using that evidence must rest in
the sound discretion of the court on which the duty in any
particular case is imposed.
Not only the courts, but individuals, are bound to know the
law, and cannot be received to plead ignorance of it. The
holder of the bonds in question can claim no indulgence on
that score, and can take no advantage from the allegation that
he is a bona fide purchaser without notice. He would, it is
true, be precluded from doing so on another ground; namely,
the want of any legislative authority in fact in the town to
issue the bonds in question. Want of such authority is a fatai
objection to their validity, no matter under what circumstances
the holder may have obtained them.
Thus far we have not adverted to the argument attempted to
be drawn by the defendants in error from the faqt that the act
in question was referred to in two subsequent acts of the
legislature as an existing law. One of these was passed on the
twenty-seventh day of March, 1869, entitled "An Act to
amend an act, entitled 'An Act to incorporate the Ottawa,
Oswego, and Fox River Valley Railroad Company."' This
act authorized the company to build a railroad from the town
of .Wenona to the city of Peoria; and, by the second section, it
was enacted "that-any city,' county, town, or township near to
or through which said road is now or may hereafter be located
is hereby authorized to subscribe to the capital stock of said
railroad, upon the terms and conditions prescribed in an act
entitled ' An Act to authorize certain cities, counties, towns,
and town~hips to subscribe to the stock of certain railroads,' in
force Feb. 18, 1857." The title here recited is not the title of
the act in question. It differs from it in several respects, though
this was probably the one that was intended to be referred to.
Supposing it to have been the one referred to, it is not pretended

TowN OF SOUTH OTTAWA v. PERKINS.

[Sup. Ct.

that this act of March 27, 1869, embraces the town of South
Ottawa, or the county of Kendall, whose bonds are the subject
of the present suits. But it is urged that the reference to the
act of 1857 is such a recognition of that act as to give it validity,
if it had none before. This was certainly not the purpose of
the act of 1869, nor do we think that such was its effect. The
legislature could not thus, in 1869, give validity to a void act
as an act passed in 1857, which was not constitutionally passed
in that year; for that would be an evasion of the Constitution.
It could at most give it vitality as a new act from the date of
the act of 1869. But this it does not profess to do: it only
adopts its provisions for the purposes of the act then passed.
And if the legislature' of 1869 could have validated all proceedings had under the supposed act of 1857, it did not do so. It
did not profess to do it. No such purpose is indicated in it.
The most that can be said is, that, in referring to the act of
1857, the legislature inadvertently supposed that it had been
regularly passed. Whether such inadvertence was the result
of a false suggestion by interested parties, or otherwise, is of
no consequence. No intent to validate and establish the act
of 1857, as a law, can be gathered from the terms of the act
of March 27, 1869. To give to such a reference in a subsequent
act, as is here relied on, the effect of validating or reviving or
vitalizing a void or repealed statute, when no such intention is
expressed, would be dangerous, and would lay the foundation
for evil practices. The legislature might in this way be entrapped into the enactment or re-enactment of laws when it
had no intention, or even suspicion, that it was doing so.
The other act relied on was passed on the twentieth day of
April, 1869, and is entitled "An Act to amend an act entitled
'An Act authorizing certain cities, counties, towns, and townships to subscribe to the stock of certain railroads,' in force
Feb. 18, 1857;" being the act in question, if the words "in
force" are construed to refer to the date of its supposed passage.
This amendatory act declares that in addition to the cities,
counties, towns, and townships agthorized by the said act to
which this is an amendment, to subscribe to the stock of the
Ottawa, Oswego, and Fox River Valley Railroad, the following
portions of cities, counties, towns, and townships be authorized

Oct. 1876.]

271

Towx OF SOUTHr OTTAWA v. PERKINS.

to subscribe to the capital stock of said railroad in manner as
provided in said act, except as hereinafter provided. The act
then proceeds to designate the portions of towns referred to.
The same observations apply to this act which have been
made in regard to the act of March 27, 1869. It does not profess or purport to give any new force or validity to the supposed
act of 1857, or to validate any proceedings had under that act.
It takes for granted -

mistakenly, as we have seen

-

that the

act was duly passed, and does nothing more.
The last-mentioned act could not, in any event, by any prospective effect, aid the holders of the bonds in suit; for the
elections called to authorize their issue were held before this
act was passed, as appears by the recitals in the bonds themselves. Indeed, the election authorizing the Ottawa bonds was
held in 1866,- long before the passage of either of the acts
referred to; and, in the absence of any expression in the laws
themselves, evincing such an intention, it can hardly be claimed
that these laws gave any retroactive validity to elections which
were without authority, and void, when they were held.
It is to be observed that these statutes were before the
Supreme Court of Illinois when deciding the case of Miller &
.Paddoc7 v. Goodwin, being set up and relied on in the answer
of the defendants in that case; but the court evidently did not
regard them as having the effect claimed. The bonds were
held to be void, and the collection of taxes to pay them was
perpetually enjoined.
We do not perceive that the act of Congress, prescribing the
mode in which the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings
in each State shall be authenticated so as to take effect in every
other State, has any-bearing whatever on the case. The authentication thus provided for was intended as evidence only of the
existence of such acts and records, and not to give them any
greater validity or effect than that which they had in the State
from which they we're thus accredited. The act expressly declares that i when thus authenticated, they shall have such faith
and credit given to them in every court within the United
States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State
from whence they are taken. It merely provides a mode of
proving public records, leaving them, when proved, invested

TOWN OF SOUTH OTTAWA V. PERKINS.

[Sup. Ct.

with the same force and effect (and no other) which they have
at home. But when a court of the United States is held in any
State, it is bound to know the laws of such State the same as
the domestic courts are.
Judgments reversed, and records remanded with directions to
award in each case a venire facias de novo.
MR. CIIF JUSTICE WAITE, with whom concurred MI.
JUSTICE CLIFFORD, MR.JUSTICE SWAYNE, and MR.JUSTICE

STRO.NG, dissenting.

I am unable to agree to the judgment which has been rendered in this case. There is no doubt but that the construction
which the courts of Illinois have uniformly given the Constitution of the State is binding upon us as a rule of decision. The
difference between me and the majority of my brethren is as to
the construction that has been given, not as to its effect when
ascertained. After a careful consideration of all the cases to
which our attention has been directed, I am forced to the
conclusion that the question has been made by the courts of
Illinois one of fact and not of law. The majority of this court
think it has been'made one of law. Such a construction might
and probably would be more logical; but our duty is to ascertain
what has been decided, not what should have been.
The case of Spangler v. Jacoby, 14 Ill. 297, is the first of a
long series of cases in which this question has been considered;
and, so far as I have been able to discover, little has been done
since, except to reaffirm and apply what was there decided.
Looking, then, to that case, we find that prima facie an act
enrolled, signed by the speakers of the two houses, approved by
the governor, deposited in the office of the Secretary of State,
and published under his superintendence among the laws certified by him, is a valid law. The language of the court is:
"The act in question was signed by the speakers of the two
houses, and it received the assent of the executive. Prima
facie, therefore, it became a law." Afterward, in Illinois
Central Railroad Co. v. Wren, 43 'id. 79, it, is said, "The
laws certified by the Secretary of State, and publish6d by the
authority of the State, must be received as having passed
the legislature in the manner require'd by the Constitution,

Oct. 1876.]

unless the contrary clearly appears." And, again, no longer
ago than last year, in Larrison v. Peoria,Atlanta, & -Decatur
RTailroad Co., 77 id. 18, "If we find a law signed by the
speakers of the two houses, and approved by the governor, we
must presume that it has been passed in conformity to all the
requirements of the Constitution, and is valid until the presumption is overcome by legitimate proof."
This law was enrolled; signed by the speakers of the two
houses; approved by the governor; deposited in the office of.:
the Secretary of State; published by him with the requisite
certificate among the laws passed at the session of the legislature in 1857; acquiesced in by the people of the State as a
valid law for more than thirteen years after its publication;
accepted and acted upon by the inhabitants of South Ottawa
in October, 1866, when they voted under it for a subscription
to the stock of the railroad company, and authorized the issue
of the bonds of the township in payment; recognized as a valid
and existing law by the legislature of the State, March 27,
1869, and April 20, 1869, when laws were passed referring t6
it as in force, and amending it; and finally acted upon by the
officers of the township, when, in obedience to the vote of
the inhabitants, they subscribed to the stock of the railroad
company, and issued the bonds authorized by the act in payment.
In this condition of things the courts were bound to take
judicial notice of it as a law in force. This was expressly
decided in .llinois Central Railroad Co. v. -Wren, supra,where
it was said, "Although we take judicial notice of all acts of
the legislature signed by the governor and found in the office
of the Secretary of State, and although for some purposes we
may take judicial notice of the legislative journals, yet it is not
our province, at the suggestion or request of counsel, to undertake to explore these journals for the purpose of ascertaining
the manner in which a law duly certified went through the.
legislature:and into the hands of the governor. If counsel say,
the journal shows a law to have been passed withotit calling
the yeas and nays, let them make the requisite proof of that
fact by means of the legislative journals, and introduce the
proof into the record."

OF SOUTH OTTAWA v. PERKINS.

[SUp. Ot.

And again, during the same year, 1867, in Grob v. Cushman,
45 id. 124, where the question was as to the jurisdiction of the
La Salle County Court, in a case which was brought before
the Supreme Court for examination upon a writ of error, this
language is used: "It is insisted that the La Salle County Court did not have
jurisdiction of the subject-matter of this cause ; that the act of the
legislature under which the jurisdiction is claimed never became
a law in the mode prescribed by the Constitution. And counsel, in
their argument, refer to the journals of the house in support of this
position. On the trial below, no evidence from the journals was
introduced. But it is now urged, that, as they are public records,
the court will take judicial notice of them, and not require them to
be embodied in the evidence. It is true that they are public records,
but it does not follow that they will be regarded as within the
knowledge of the courts, like public laws. Like other records and
public documents, they should be brought before the courts as evidence. But when offered, they prove their own authenticity.
Until so produced, they cannot be regarded by the courts."
Both these cases were decided two years before the bonds
now in suit were issued.
Later, in 1871, in the case of The People v. De ylfe, 62 id.
258, an application was made for a mandamus requiring a justice of the peace to issue an execution upon a judgment recovered before him. In his return, he stated that the act under
which he assumed jurisdiction when he gave the judgment had
never in fact been constitutionally passed, and gave the particulars of his claim in that behalf. In delivering the opinion,
the court clearly considered the question presented as one of
fact, for they say "It appears by the return, which is not traversed, and is to be
taken as true, &c. .

.

. Our decision is predicated solely upon the

state of facts as set forth in the return in this case, without an inspection of the journals of the Senate, and we pass upon the validity
of the act in questionno further than as affects the present application in view of the admitted facts in the case."
It is difficult to see what could b6 done to manifest more
clearly the determination of the court to make the question

whether a prima facie statute had been constitutionally passed
one of fact, to be established by "legitimate proof" when a
contest arises. This may operate to glve an apparent statute
effect under one state of circumstances, and not under another;
but with that we have nothing to do. Our duty is ended when
we have discovered and complied with the rule which the
appropriate tribunal has established.
Under the operation of this rule the plaintiff below made out
his case, when he proved the execution of his bonds and put
them in evidence; and, in the absence of proof by the defendant, he was entitled to his judgment, even though the law
might not have been constitutionally passed: because it was
no part of the duty of the court "to explore the journals for
the purpose of ascertaining the manner in which a law duly
certified went through the legislature."
The question then is, -whether, under the circumstances of
this case, the defendant can be permitted to make the proof.
This does not depend upon the constructiQn of the Constitution,
but upon the general principles of commercial law applicable
to the Constitution as construed. The issue is made upon the
fact of the passage of the law. Primafade it was passed, and
it was apparently in force. Both parties acting upon this
primafacie case, and supposing it to be true in fact, have become bound: one has borrowed and the other lent. The lender
has performed his part of the contract and deliveredfthe money,
and the simple question to be determined now is, whether, under such circumstances, the borrower can refuse to pay, because,
upon further investigation, he has ascertained that the legislative journals do not contain the necessary evidence to establish
the fact of the due enactment of the law. Reverse the case.
Suppose the town had subscribed for the stock and paid the
subscription, could the railroad company keep, the money and
refuse to issue the stock because, after the transaction, it had
ascertained that a vote had not been taken by ayes and noes in
one of the houses upon.the final passage of the bill? Certainly
not; and the reason is obvious. Under such circumstances, the
law estops the party from asserting the falsehood of that which
appears to be true. This rule has, from the beginning, been
applied here to this class of cases. It.was first stated in Corn-

missoners of Knox County v. Aspinwall, 21 How. 545, where,
using the language of Ch. B. Jervis in Royal British Bank v.
Tarquand, 6 El. & Bi. 527, it was said: "We may now take it for granted that the dealings with these
companies are not like dealings with other partnerships, and that
the parties dealing with them are bound to read the statute and the
deed of settlement. But they are not bound to do more. And
the party here, on reading the deed of settlement, will find, not a
prohibition from borrowing, but a permission to do so on certain
conditions. Finding that the authority might be made complete
by a resolution, he would bave the right to infer the fact of a resolution authorizing that which, on the face of the document, appeared
to be legitimately done."
It is unnecessary to refer to the numerous cases which 'have
come up since. While some of them have gone further than
the English court did in that from which the quotation was
made, none have fallen short of it. We need not go further in
this. The purchasers of thege bonds were bound to read the
statute under which they were issued, but they were not bound
to do more. Finding it upon the statute-book, apparently in
force, they had the right to infer that it was actually in force,
and govern themselves accordingly.
It must be remembered that this is not a case of construction.
The question is not whether a law admitted to be in force
confers the necessary power, but whether a law which does
confer the power, and is apparently in force, can be shown not
to have been in fact passed according to the requirements of
the Constitution, after parties have acted upon the faith of it
and changed their condition. When the question is one of
construction alone, all parties stand upon an equal footing, and
each can judge for himself. If a mistake occurs, it is one of law
and not of fact. Here it is one of.fact. The bonds on which
this suit is brought are primafacievalid; and, as between these
parties, I think the law will not admit the testimony offered to
show that they are void. In the absence of proof they stand.
The question is one of evidence. It is not whether the law
was passed, but whether testimony can be introduced to show
that it was not. I think it cannot. To admit it would ignore
a principle of commercial honor upon which we have made

long line of decisions. I am not prepared to do so. 'If the
eourts of Illinois had been willing to take judicial notice of
the legislative journals in determining what the law of the State
is, there might be some propriety in requiring the people to do
so. But when the courts make the question of overcoming a
prima facie law one of fact, I think the people may do the
same thing, and bring to their protection the same principles
of estoppel which govern them in other cases. For these reasons
I dissent from the opinion which has just been read.
NoTE. - At a subsequent day of the term, counsel for the plaintiffs in error
moved the court for further instructions in these cases to the court below. AIR.
JUSTICa BnADLEY, on behalf of the court, said: " We do not think any further'
directions necessary in these cases. We hold that the estoppel set up by the
plaintiff below'should not be allowed, but that the defendant should be permitted
to show the invalidity of the act relied on by the plaintiff. We recognize the
construction of the Constitution of Illinois adopted by the State court, to the effect
that a law is void if not passed by the requisite majority, and so entered on the
journal. We also hold the existence of a law to be a judicial question, to be
decided by the court, though framed in form as an issue of fact. It follows that
the court below, on retrying the case, must itself be satisfied whether the law in
question was or was not constitutionally passed, and the vote entered on the
journals, and instruct the jury accordingly. The evidence, or means of ascertaining this fact, must be such as is legally applicable to such a case according to
the laws of Illinois. But, strictly speaking, the issue is more properly referable
to the court than to a jury. That it may be so framed the judgment will be
amended, directing the court below to award in each case a venire de novo, or to
allow the parties to amend their pleadings, as they shall he advised,-in order
to refer the trial of the issue to the court instead of the jury."
