COLLImS v.

GILBERT.

Commns v. GLBERT.
1.

A negotiable instrument, payable to bearer, or indorsed in blank, produced by
a transferee suing to recover its contents, is, when received in evidence,
clothed with the primafacie presumption that he became the holder of it for
value at its date in the usual course of business, without notice of any thing
to impeach his title.
2. The title of a bona ide holder for value of an accepted draft, indorsed in blank,
is not affected by the fact that the party from whom he received it before
its maturity had possession of it for certain -purposes, and misappropriated it.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Western District of Pennsylvania.
This suit was brought by Gilbert & Gay against Thomas
Collins upon his acceptance of a certain draft for $8,000, drawn
by P. F. Collins & Co., to their own order, and by them indorsed in blank.
The firm of P. F. Collins & Co. consisted of P. F. Collins
and John M. Moorhead, who were', as sub-contractors, engaged
in grading seven miles of the Connecticut Western Railroad,
then in process of construction. The contractor with the railroad company was one Barnes, who was to pay them monthly
for work done, less fifteen per cent, retained to secure the proper
completion of their contract with him; but they were unable to
proceed with the work unless he advanced the retained percentage. He agreed to do so, if they would give him as security for their-execution of the contract, to be held by him for
that purpose, an acceptance of Thomas Collins to the amount
of $8,000.
The draft accepted by him was accordingly given to Barnes,
for -whom it was discounted by the plaintiffs. The jury found
for the plaintiffs; and judgment having been rendered upon the
verdict, the case was brought here.
The errors assigned are grounded upon the exclusion by the
court below of -certain evidence offered by Collins, a statement
of which is given in the opinion of the court.
Argued by .Mr. Richard T. Herrick for the plaintiff in error,
and by fr. Hill Burgwin for the defenaants in error.

COLLINS v. GILBERT.

[Sup. Ct.

MR. JUSTICE CLFroRD delivered the opinion of the court.
Transferees of a negotiable instrument, such as a bill of exchange or promissory note payable subsequent to its date, hold
the instrument clothed with the presumption that it was negotiated for value in the usual course of business at the time of
its execution, and without notice of any equities between the
prior parties to the instrument.
Instruments of the kind are commercial paper in the strictest
sense, and must ever be regarded as favored instruments as well
on account of their negotiable quality as their universal convenience in mercantile affairs. They may be transferred by
indorsement, or, when indorsed in blank or made payable to
bearer, they are transferable by mere delivery. Goodman v.
Harvey, 4 Ad. & E. 870; Goodman v. Simonds, 20 How.
365; Wheeler v. Guild, 20 Pick. (Mass.) 551; -Noxon v.
De Wolf, 10 Gray (Mass.), 846; Mager v. Badger, 84 N. Y. 249.
Possession of such an instrument payable to bearer, or indorsed in blank, is prima facie evidence that the holder is the
proper owner and lawful possessor of the same; and nothing
short of fraud, not even gross negligence, if unattended with
mala fides, is sufficient to overcome the effect of that evidence,
or to invalidate the title of the holder supported by that presumption. Story on Bills (4th ed.), sect. 416; Byles on Bills
(10th ed.), 119; Chitty on Bills (12th ed.), 257; Mills v.
Barber, 1 Mee. & W. 425; Murray v. Lardner, 2 Wall. 110;
Bank of Pittsburghv. Neal et al., 22"How. 96.
Apply that rule in a suit in the name of the transferee against
the maker, and it is clear that he has nothing to do in the opening of his case except to prove the signatures to the instrument,
and introduce the same in evidence, as the instrument goes to
the jury clothed with the presumption that the plaintiff became the holder of the same for value at its date, in the usual
course of business, without notice of any thing to impeach his
title. Bankc v. Leighton, Law Rep. 2 Exch. 61; Pettee v.
Prout, 3 Gray (Mass.), 508; Way v. _ichardson, 8 id. 418.
Clothed as the instrument is with those presumptions, the
plaintiff is not bound to introduce any evidence to show that he
gave value for the same until the other party has clearly proved
that the consideration of the instrument was illegal, or that it

was fraudulent in its inception, or that it had been lost or stolen
before it came to the possession of the holder. Uther v. Rich,
10 Ad. & E. 784; Bailey v. Bidwell, 13 Mee. & W. 73; Arbouin v. Anderson, 1 Ad. & E. w. s. 504; Bank v. Fagan,

7 Moore, P. C. 76; Fitch v. Jones, 5 El. & B1. 238; Smith v.
Braine, 16 Ad. & E. N. s. 251; Hall v. Peatherstone, 3 Hurls.
& Nor. 286.
Sufficient appears to show that the drawers of the draft described in the declaration were sub-contractors to grade seven
miles of a railroad referred- to in the affidavit of defence, and
that they were to be paid monthly for work done, subject to a
certain deduction to be retained as a security for the completion
of their contract. Moneys received from the monthly payments
being insufficient for the purpose, they were unable to complete
their undertaking without an advance from the principal contractor. What they wanted was an advance of $8,000; and it
appears that he contractor was willing to make it, if they
would give him the acceptance of the defendant in the same
amount, as a security that they would perform their contract.
Pursuant to that arrangement, they drew their draft upon the
defendant in that amount, payable to the order of their senior
partner; and the record shows that the draft was accepted by
the defendant, and was duly indorsed by the payee.
Beyond doubt, the draft was duly execdted and delivered to
the contractor as security for the performance of the contract
of the drawers of the instrument. By its terms it was payable
in ninety days from date; and it must be assumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the plaintiffs became the
holders of the same before maturity.
Payment being refused, the plaintiffs instituted the present
suit to recover the amount. Process was served, and the defendant appeared and pleaded that he never accepted the draft,
and that he never promised in manner and form as alleged in
the declaration. Subsequently the parties went to trial, and
the yerdict and judgment were for the plaintiffs. Exceptions
were filed by the defendant, and he sued out the present writ
of error.
Six offers of proof were made by the defendant in the course'
of the trial, all of which were excluded by the court., subject to

COLLINS V. GILBERT.

[Sup. Ot.

the exception of the defendant. Four of the rulings of the
court in that regard are now assigned for error, and they present the only matters of controversy exhibited in the record.
Rulings of the kind, not assigned for error, may be dismissed
without remark; nor would the other two exceptions have required much examination, even if they had been assigned for
error, as they involve substantially the same questions as those
presented by the other rulings of the court.
1. Testimony having been introduced by the defendant that
one of the plaintiffs was informed, before the draft came into
their hands, that the contractor had agreed to advance money
to enable the sub-contractors to pay their employ6s, they, the
sub-contractors, giving the defendant an acceptance as security
in lieu of retained percentage, the defendant proposed to ask
the witness what was the arrangement between the sub-contractors and the contractor; by virtue of which the defendant's
acceptance was obtained-, to which the plaintiffs objected, and
the court excluded the question.
2. Evidence having been given by the same witness that
there was an arrangement between the sub-contractors and the
contractor, to the effect that the latter would advance money
to the former to pay their men, upon their giving to the contractor the defendant's acceptance, to be retained by him in
lieu of the stipulated percentage, the defendant proposed to
show by the same witness that the work was finished by the
defendant, and that by the terms of the contract all of the percentage retained became due and payable when the contract
was completed; which offer of proof was objected to by the
plaintiffs, and was ruled out by the court.
8. Complete execution of the draft is not denied; but the
theory of the defendant is, that the contractor took the same of
the sub-contractors in lieu of retained percentage; and he proposed to show that the sub-contractors subsequently abandoned
their contract, and that the defendant, at the suggestion of the
contractor, finished the same, he agreeing that if the defei)dant
would complete the work, he, the contractor, would return the
acceptance; and- that the defendant never got either the percentage or the acceptance: to which the plaintiffs objected,
and the court excluded the testimony.

ot. 1876.]

COLLINS v. GiLBERT.

4. Finally, the defendant proposed to show that the contractor, when the acceptance was delivered to him, was indebted to
the sub-contractors for retained percentage in excess of- the
amount of the acceptance; which was also objected toby the
plaintiffs, and was excluded by the court.
Properly an4alyzed and construed, it is quite obvious that
these several offers of proof present but a single question, and
that they serve to illustrate very fully the different theories of
law maintained by the respective parties in respect to such
commercial instruments. Throughout the trial the plaintiffs
contended that they were the bona fide holders for value of
the acceptance, having received the same before maturity in the
usual course of business, and that they held a good title to the
instrument, unless the defendant could show that, they had
notice of such facts as were sufficient to impeach. the title
between the antecedent parties, or that the consideration of the
instrument was illegal, or that it was fraudulent in its inception, or that it had been lost or stolen before it came to their
possession. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 15.
Due delivery of the executed draft to the contractor indorsed
in blank is admitted; but the theory of the defendant is that
the contractor received it merely as security that the sub-contractors would perform their contract, and that the contractor
caused it to be discounted without authority. Neither illegality of consideration nor fraud in the inception of the instrument
is charged or pretended; nor is it alleged that the acceptance
had been lost or stolen before th plaintiffs received it for discount. Instead of that, the theory of the defendant assumes
that the contractor became the lawful holder of the acceptance
indorsed in blank for the specified purpose, which is an implied
admission that the acceptance was one of a class of commercial
instruments which may be transferred by delivery.
Suppose that is so, still it is insisted by the defendant that
evidence is admissible in such a case to show that the first
holder under such circumstances appropriated the acceptance
to a use other than that for which it was delivered to him, and
that proof of such a misappropriation is sufficient to impeach
the title of a subsequent holder for value, even though it came
into his possession before maturity in the usual course of
business.

COLLINS V. GILBERT.

[Sup. Ct.

Where the supposed defect or infirmity in the title of the
instrument appears on its face at the time of the transfer, the
question, whether the party who took it had notice or not, is, in
general, a question of construction, and must be determined by
the court as matter of law. Andrews v. Pond, 13 Pet. 65;
Fowler v. Brantly, 14 id. 318; Brown Y. Davis, 8 T. R. 86.
But it is a very different matter when it is proposed to impeach the title of a holder for value by proof of any facts and
circumstances outside of the instrument itself. He is then to
be affected, if at all, by what has occurred between other parties, and he may well claim exemption from any consequences
flowing from their acts, unless it be first shown that he had
knowledge of such facts and circumstances at the time the
transfer was made. Nothing less than proof of that character
can meet the exigencies of such a defence, if it be true that a
party who acquires commercial paper for value in the usual
course of business may, if it was acquired before maturity and
without notice of any defect in the title, hold it free of all
equities between the antecedent parties to the instrument.
Indorsees of negotiable bills of exchange and promissory
notes enjoyed the benefit of that rule for ages before any attempt was made to annex any qualification to it, unless it appeared that the consideration was illegal, or that the instrument
wad fraudulent in its inception, or that it had been lost or
stolen before it came to the possession of the holder. ffinton's
Oase, 2 Show. 247; Anonymous, 1 Salk. 126; Miller v. Bace,
1 Burr. 462; Grant v. Vaughan, 3 id. 1516; Peacock v. Bhodes,
2 Doug. 633; Lawson v. Weston, 4 Esp. 56.
Attempt was subsequently made to qualify that right of a
bona fide holder, and to establish the rule, that if the indorser
of the instrument had no valid title to the same, and that such
facts and circumstances were known to the indorsee at the time
of the transfer as would have caused a person of ordinary prudbnce to suspect that the indorser had no right to transfer the
instrument or to use the same for his own benefit, then the
holder, as against the acceptor or maker, is not entitled to
recover. Gill v. Cubitt, 3 B. & 0. 466.
Though the modified rule was never satisfactory, yet it must
be admitted that it was followed for a time in many jurisdic-

v.

GILBERT.

But it, is unnecessary to discuss that topic, as the case

referred to has been distinctly -overruled in the tribunal where
it was decided, and has not been considered an authority there
for more than forty years. Goodnan v. Harvey, 4 Ad. & E.
870.
Abundant authority for that proposition is found in the cases
already cited, and Mr. Chitty says that the old rule of law,
that the holder of bills of exchange, indorsed in blank and
transferable by delivery, can give a title which he does not pos
sess to a person taking the same bona fide for value, is again
re-established in its fullest extent. Chitty on Bills (12th ed.),
257:
Speaking upon that subject, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts said that it was once held that the holder of a bill of
exchange or promissory note fraudulently put in circulation
must show that he, had used due and reasonable caution in taking it; but the court proceeds to say that it has since been
definitively adjudged that if he took the instruent in good faith
he is entitled to recover on it, and that even gross negligence
is not tantamount to fraud, though it may be given in evidence
as tending to prove that charge, that the burden of proving
good faith: is all the burden which the law imposes on such a
holder. Worcester Bank v. Dorchester Ban7, 10 Cush. (Mass.)
491.
Conclusive support to that conclusion is found in the authorities which the court cite for that. purpose, among which are the
following; Goodman v. Harvey, 4 Ad. & E. 870; Arbouin v.
Anderson, 1 Ad. & E. w. s. 504. We must hold, said Lord Denman, in the case last cited, that the owner of a bill of exchange is
entitled to recover upon it if he has come by it honestly, and
that that fact is implied prima facie by possession; that, to
meet the inference so raised, fraud, felony, or some such matter,
must be proved. Smith v. Sac County, 11 Wall. 146:
Instruments of the kind are intended for circulation, and
Shaw, Ch. J., says that the law is so framed to give confidence
and security to those who receive them, for valuable consideration, in the ordinary course of business, when payable to bearer
or indorsed in blank, so as to be transferable by delivery; and
he adds that, in general, a party taking such an instrument

OWNs v. GIIm1.

[u.(t (it.
[Sup.

-under such circumstances has only to look to the credit of the
parties to it, and the regularity and genuineness of the signatures and indorsements. So that if such a bill or note be made
without consideration, or be lost or stolen and afterwards be
negotiated for a valuable consideration, in the usual course of
business, to one who has no knowledge of those facts, .his title
is good, and he shall be entitled to receive the amount. Wheeler
v. Guild, 20 Pick. (Mass.) 850.
Title and possession in such a case are, in general, considered
one and inseparable, and it will be presumed that a party thus
in possession of such an instrument holds it for value until the
contrary appears, and the burden of proof is on the party
impeaching his title. Collins v. Martin, 1 B. & P. 648; Bank
v. Hoge, 35 N. Y. 68; Phelan v. Moss, 67 Penn. St. 63;
Raphael v. Ban7, 17 C. B. 171.
In order to defeat the rights of a bona fide holder for value
of a promissory note, which it is claimed was procured by
fraud, it must be shown, either directly or by circumstances,
that he had notice of such infirmity.
Proof of suclh facts and circumstances as would have put a
reasonable man upon inquiry in relation thereto are not sufficient to constitute a defence to a suit by the holder. Lake v.
Reed, 29 Iowa, 359; Gage v. Sharp, 24 id. 15.
Adjudged cases to support those propositions are very numerous, and it is equally well settled that where a negotiable bill
or note is given in evidence duly indorsed, the legal presumption is that such indorsement was made at the date of the
instrument, or at least antecedently to its becoming due;
and the rule is, that if the defendant would avail himself of
any defence not open to him, unless the bill or note was negotiated after it was dishonored, it is incumbent on him to show
that the indorsement was in fact made after the instrument
was overdue. Banger v. Cary, 1 Met. (Mass.) 873; Noxon v.
-- e Wolf, 10 Gray (Mass.), 847.
Actual possession of a negotiable instrument, payable to
bearer or indorsed in blank, is plenary evidence of title in the
holder "until other evidence is produced to control it; " but if
to an action on the same "the defendant pleads that it was
illegal in its inception, and that the plaintiff took it without

OcL. 1876.]

COLLINS V. GILBERT.

value, the illegality being proved, the onus is cast upon the
plaintiff to prove that he gave value." Smith v. -Braine,
16 Ad. & E. x. s. 250; Bailey v. Bidwell, 18 Mee. & W. 73.
Proof of gross negligence is not sufficient to overcome the
primafacie presumption of title arising from possession; but if
it be alleged and proved that the instrument had its inception
in illegality or fraud, a presumption arises from that proof
that the plaintiff took it without value, or, in other words, it
so far shifts the burden of proof, that, unless the plaintiff gives
satisfactory evidence that he gave value for the same, the
defence will prevail. Fitch v. Jones, 5 El. & B1. 246; Harvey
v. Towers, 6 Hurls. & Gord. 660.
Where there are circumstances, in the nature of fraud or
illegality, which can properly be left to the jury, proof of those
circumstances by the defendant will cast on the plaintiff the
onus of showing that he gave value for the bill or note. Hall
v. Zeatherstone, 8 id. 287; Mills v. Barber, 1 Mee. & W. 432.
Negotiable instruments are expressed to be for value, and.
if payable to bearer or indorsed hi blank, they pass by delivery
from hand to hand, clothed with that presumption; nor is that
presumption overcome, where the suit is in the name of a subsequent holder, "by proof that the indorsement was for the
accommodation of the maker.
If it appears that the bill or note was obtained by fraud, or
that it had been stolen before it came to the possession of the
holder, then the presumption may arise that the holder did
not pay full consideration for it, because in such a case it is
probable that the person obtaining the instrument would pass
it away for less than its full value. But where there is only
the simple fact that it was an accommodation bill or note,
then the inference is that the holder did give value for it,
because that was the very object for which the instrument was
given. -Percivalv. Pram~pton, 2 Cromp., L & R. 183; Beybel
v. Bank, 54 N. Y. 291.
Decided cases, almost -without number, support that proposition ; but if the note or bill is founded i fraud, or was fraudulently obtained and put in circulation, the indorsee must prove
that he paid value for it before he can recover the amount.

FORBES v. GRACEY.
1.Although the title to mineral lands may remain in the United States, tne ores,
when dug or detached from the lands under a mining claim, are free from
any lien, claim, or title of the United States, and, becoming personal property, are, as such, subject to State taxation in like manner as other personal
property.
2. The words "mines or mining claims" in the sixth section of the act of the
legislature of Nevada of Feb. 28, 1871, imposing a tax upon such ores, and
making it "a lien on the mines or mining claims from which the ores or
minerals bearing gold or silver are extracted for reduction," were evidently
intended to distinguish between cases in which the miner is the owner of
the soil, and therefore has a perfect title to the mine, and those in which he
works under a mining claim, the title to the land remaining in the United
States. In the first case, the tax is a valid lien on the mine itself; but in the
second, only upon his possessory right, under existing laws and regulations,
to work and explore the mine.
8. Such a claim is property in the fullest sense of the word. It is subject to a
lien for taxes, and may be sold for the non-payment of them, without infringing the title of the United States.

District of Nevada.

This was a suit brought by appellant to enjoin the collector
of taxes for Story County, Nevada, from collecting a tax imposed by the law of that State upon the property of the Consolidated Virginia Mining Company, the appellant being a
stockholder in the company and an alien subject of the Queen
of Great Britain. The tax is, by the State statute, imposed
upon the proceeds of the mine worked by the corporation, and
is resisted on the ground that the title to the land from which
