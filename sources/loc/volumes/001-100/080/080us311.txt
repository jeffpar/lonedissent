signs shall within one year from the time of the recording
of the tax deed for such premises commence an action. for
the purpose of testing the validity of such sale, or be forever
barred in the premises."
It is a sufficient answer to this view of the operation of
this statute, that the Supreme Court of Minnesota has adjudged that the statute does not apply to cases where the
owner of the property defends against a tax deed in an action
of ejectment; and if it were susceptible of such application
that the statute itself would be in conflict with the constitution of the State.* This construction of a State law upon
a question affecting the titles to real property in the State by
its highest court, is binding upon the Federal courts.

1. To entitle a name to equitable protection as a trade-mark, the right
to its use must be exclusive, and not one which others may employ
with as much truth as those wflo use it. And this is so although the
use by a second producer, in describing truthfully his product, of a
name or a combination of words already in use by another, may have
the effect of causing the public to mistake as to the origin or ownership
of the product. Purchasers though mistaken, are not in such a case
deceived by false representations, and equity will not enjoin against
telling the truth.
2. Hence no one can apply the name of a district of country to a well-known
article of commerce, and obtain thereby such an exclusive right to the
application as to prevent others inhabiting the district or dealing in
similar articles coming from the district, from truthfully using the
same designation.

valley, could not be enjoined against calling their coal "Lackawanna
coal," it being in fact and in its generic character properly so designated, although more properly described when specifically spoken of as
"Scranton coal" or "Pittston coal," and when specifically spoken of
usually so called.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the Southern District
of New York; the case, which arose on a bill to enjoin the
use of an alleged trade-mark, being thus:
In the northeastern section of Pennsylvania there exists
a place or region to which from early times the name of
Lorckaworna, or Lackawanna, seems, on the few occasions
when the place is mentioned, to have been given. As early
as 1793, the diary of William Colbert, a pioneer preacher of
the Methodists, makes record of his meeting a person who
lived at ":Lackawanna," and of his crossing a mountain and
getting there himself. A deed, dated in 1774, speaks of a
river running through that valley or region as " the Lackaworna," and another deed dated in 1796 conveyed "lands
lying and being in Upper Settlement, so-called, and abutting
on each side of the Lackawanna." The region, however, in
those early times was uncultivated and little known to people generally in any Way, and the name was unheard of and
unnoted except by those who were dwelling in the very district.
0
The discovery and use of coal in Pennsylvania, soon after
the year 1820, wrought an immense change in the whole
northeastern part of the State. It brought this valley and
others, as, for example, the Wyoming, Lehigh, and Schuylkill, into very prominent position and interest; and the
"Lackawanna Valley" soon became a well-known and sufficiently defined region; one of large dimensions, extending
along what had become known as the Lackawanna River to
its junction with the Susquehanna.* In 1825 the Delaware
and Hudson Canal Company purchased coal lands in this

Laha-whanna; the two words signifying the meeting of two streams. See

region, and in order to mine and bring the coal there to
market, constructed at great expense a canal from Rondout,
on the Hudson, to Honesdale, in Pennsylvania, a distance
of one hundred and eight miles, and a railroad thence to
their coal mines, which they had since maintained, for
the purpose of bringing their coal to market. This transport they began to make in 1828, and had ever since been
engaged in taking out coal and in carrying it to the Hudson
River and to the markets of the country; gradually increasing their annual productions. In the first year they produced 720 tons, in the second year 43,000 tons, and in 1866
1,300,000 -tons.
The coal coming from the Lackawanna Valley, and it
being impossible for ordinary persons by mere inspection to
distinguish it from that mined elsewhere, it naturally got,
or artificially had given to it, at the commencemet of the
company's business, the name "Lackawanna coal;" and by
this name it had been generally afterwards known and called
in the market.
Although this coal came from a section of country called
both by geologists and the public the Lackawanna region,
still the company were, without doubt, the first and for more
than twenty years the only producers of coal from that region, and during all this time their coal had become favorably known in market by th name already mentioned.
In 1850, another company, the Pennsylvania Coal Company, began to mine coal from their mines situated in the
same general region of country, and for the first two years
the coal which they mined was partially prepared and
brought to market by the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, already named as the original operators, and sold
under contract in common with their own; but, about 1852,
when the Pennsylvania company began itself to bring its
coal to market and to sell it, it got or had given to it the
name of "Pittston coal," by which it was frequently or
generally known and called, especially when specifically
spoken of.
Afterwards, about 1856, a third company-the Delaware,

CANAL

COMPANY V. CLARK.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

Lackawanna, and Western Railroad Company-began to
mine coal from mines which they owned, situated in other
parts of the same section of country, and to distinguish it
from that of other producers, their coal got or had given to
it the name of " Scranton coal," by which it had since been
frequently or generally known and called, especially when
meant to be particularly referred to.
Coals from other parts of the same region got or bad given
to them distinctive names; such as Lehigh coal, Hazelton
coal, Spring Mountain coal, Sugarloaf coal, &c., and in like
manner coals from the Schuylkill region acquired or had
given to them distinctive names by which the same were
known more particularly in the market.
With all this, however, all the varieties coming, as in
effect they did, from the same great veins or strata, were
not unfi'equently of later times spoken of by the trade, when
speaking generally, as being Lackawanna coal; and under
the general heading of statistics relating to coal would be
spoken of in like generic terms.
The original Lackawanna was asserted by those interested
in its sale to be better prepared than either of the others.
From this circumstance or from some other it was esteemed
and commanded, with a class of purchasers, a higher price
than either the Scranton or Pittston.
The canal company had a market for their Lackawanna
coal in the City and State of New York, and also in the
cities and towns of the Eastern States, and, amongst others,
at Providence, R. I., where they had for many years sold
annually large quantities by the name of "Lackawanna
coal," by which it had been favorably known.
In this state of things, one Clark, a dealer in coals, at
Providence, advertised in the newspapers published in that
city and otherwise, that he kept on hand, for sale cheap,
large quantities of" Lackawanna coal," and in this way, and
by that vame had sold many tons of the Pittston and Scranton
coals annually. It was admitted that he did not have any
of the canal company's coal-that is to say, the original
Lackawanna-for sale.

Dec. 1871.]

CANAL

COMPANY V.

CLARK.

Statement of the case.

Hereupon the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company filed
their bill against Clark, to enjoin his calling the coal which
he sold "Lackawanna coal." The bill averred that about
the time the canal company commenced their operations,
they sought out, devised, and adopted the name "Lackawanna coal" as a special, particular, and distinctive name
or trade-mark, by which their coal might be introduced to
dealers as the product of their mines in distinction from the
coal of other producers, and that prior to their adoption of
the word Lackawanna it had never been adopted or used in
combination with the word "coal" as a name or trade-mark
for any kind of coal. Their bill also averred that ever since
their adoption of the name their coal has been called and
known in the market as "Lackawanna coal," and by no
other name.
The defendant, it was admitted, had none of the complainant's "Lackawanna coal" for sale, but dealt in coals
from another part of the Valley; sorts which when specifically distinguished, as they constantly were, were distinguished by the name of "Scranton coal," and "Pittston
coal;" coals having the same general appearance as the
complainant's "Lackawanna coal," and which the bill alleged could not be easily distinguished therefrom by inspection.
The answer denied that the nime "Lackawanna coal"
was, or ever had been, the peculiar property and trade-mark
of the complainants, or of benefit to them as establishing
the identity of the coal. It admitted that the defendant kept
coal for sale, and that he did not purchase or keep for sale
any of the company's Lackawanna coal, and that he dealt
almost exclusively in coal mentioned in the bill as Scranton
and Pittston coal, and that the two varieties were of the same
general appearance as the coal of the complainants. It denied, however, that those varieties of coal were known by
the names just mentioned, exclusively, or were of a less
good quality than the coal of the complainants, and averred
the contrary; affirming that they were equally Lackawanna

coal, and known by that name, as the evidence tended to
show that generically they were.
The court below dismissed the bill, and from that decree
the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company appealed. The
leading question presented by the appeal being whether the
complainants had an exclusive right to the use of the words
"Lackawanna coal," as a distinctive name or trade-mark for
the coal mined by them, and transported over their railroad
and canal to market; there being also some other points not
necessary to be here stated.
The case was fully and remarkably well argued on both
sides, and with a nice analysis of authorities.
Messrs. E. fl. Owen and S. P. ATash, for the plaintiffs in
error:
It cannot be doubted as a fact that the defendant advertises his coal as "Lackawanna coal," for the purpose of
inducing the public to believe that it is in fact the coal produced and sold by the canal company, and with the intention of supplanting the company in the good will of its
trade. This is a fraud upon the public, and a fraud also
upon the company suing; depriving them of the benefit of
any right they have in the word Lackawanna, as a trademark.
Now, the canal company has a valid title to the use of the
word Lackawanna as a trade-mark. They were the first to
adopt and impose upon it the office of becoming and being
thereafter the name for their coal; so adopting and appropriating it as early as 1828, at the commencement of their
business. The first coal which they brought to market was
called and sold by the name of Lackawanna coal, and all the
coal which they have hitherto brought to market has been
sold and dealt in by that name and by none other. By such
original appropriation of the word "Lackawanna," they
acquired a title thereto, and the right to its exclusive use in
combination with the word "coal," and thereupon and thereafter, by the continued use thereof, the new compound word

:Dec.. 1871.]

DA AL C MPANY V. CLARK.
Argument in support of the trade-mark.

"Lackawanna coal" became, and was, and is, the name and
trade-mark for their coal, not limited by territorial bounds.*
It is not necessary that a word which may be adopted as
a name and trade-mark should be a new creation never before known or used, to entitle it to be so adopted. Any
word in common use may be taken, if its application be
original, and so far peculiar as to be capable, when known
to the public, of distinguishing the property of the party so
adopting it, and to which it may be attached, from that of
other parties. In such case the right of the public.to use
the word is not abridged. It can be used as originally and
in any and every other way imaginable, except in its peculiar combination with the word "coal."
The exceptions to the right to appropriate a word for a
trade-mark are, that it cannot be done when the word
adopted is merely used as descriptive of quality, as in the case
of Stokes v. Landgrafft or of Corwin v. Daly,T or of Amoskeag
Manufacturing Company v. Spear;§ or where it is the proper
name for the article, as in the case of the "Schnapps," the
subject of controversy in Wolfe v. Goulard; or where it has
by general use become the appropriate name of an article,
which all persons manufacturing the same may use, as in
the case of "Dr. Johnson's Yellow Ointment," or that of
"The Essence of Anchovies."**
The word Lackawanna, as used by the company, does
not come within these exceptions. It is not the naturally
appropriate name for coal. In its original sense it did not
mean coal, nor had it become by previous use the name of
coal, nor does it imply, nor was it intended to indicate the
quality of coal, but it was adopted for and became, and was,
and still is, the specific name thereof, indicating its origin
and ownership, and by which it could be bought and sold
in market.

Argument in support of the trade-mark.

The defendant does not pretend that he originated the
name, or that any other company or person adopted or used
it as a specific name for coal prior to the time when the canal
company adopted it. Nor has be any color of right to sell
his coal by the name of"Lackawanna coal," from the mere
fact that it comes from what is commonly known as the
Lackawanna region; more especially since it does not come
from the company's mines, nor through them as producers,
and is not, in fact, the coal known in market as Lackawanna
coal. That the different varieties, Pittston, Scranton, and
Lackawanna, may be occasionally grouped together in loose
parlance, or in the ultimate head of a statistical exhibit,
under the general name of Lackawanna coal, proves nothing.
Different varieties of Lehigh and Schuylkill coal are grouped
under those two general names. So different varieties of German wines are, and called Rhine wines, but this would give
no right to any one to use the peculiar and specific name of
one kind of coal or wine as and for the name of another
produced by a different person.
Various authorities support our view. To three as particularly doing so we refer the court.
The first is .Newman v. Alvord.* There the plaintiftf manufactured water-lime from beds near Akron, Erie County,
New York, which they called "Akron Cement, Akron
Water-lime," and the defendant manufactured a similar
article from his beds near Syracuse, Onondaga County, and
called his " Onondaga Akron Cement and Water-lime," and
it was held that the word Akron, as used by the plaintiffs,
was their trade-mark, and that they were entitled to be protected by injunction in its use.
The next case is McAndrews v. Bassel.t There it appeared that the plaintiff had first adopted and used the word
"Anatolia," as a name for his liquorice, and the defendant
insisted upon his right to use that word also as the name of
his liquorice, because it was the name of a country, the use
of which, as he alleged, was common to all, and therefore
* 49 Barbour, 588.

CANAL

COMPANY V.

Argument in support of the trade-mark.

the plaintiff had no exclusive right to its use; but the court
pronounced the argument a "fallacy," and stated that although property in a word cannot exist for all purposes, yet
it will exist when applied by way of stamp upon a stick of
liquorice, the n ioment the article thus stamped goes into
market. In the case at bar, although the coal cannot be
stamped, yet the moment it is produced in market the name
Lackawanna becomes united to it as fully as if it had been
stamped thereon. There is no difference in principle between the two cases.
The third case is Seixo v. _Provezende,* where it appeared
that the plaintiff, Baron de Seixo, was the proprietor of an
estate called the Quinta de Seixo, which was celebrated for
the port wine produced from it, and which he consigned to
London for sale, placing upon the heads of the casks various
marks, and at the bung a crown with the word, "Seixo,"
and so his wine became known as "Crown Seixo." The
defendant being the lessee of an adjoining estate known,
also, as the Quinta de Seixo, sent his wine to London with
certain marks on the bead of the casks, and at the bung
thereof a crown and the words, "Seixo de Cima" (Upper
Seixo), and he claimed the right so to use the name Seixo,
on the ground that he was owner or lessee of a vineyard
adjoining the plaintiff's, also of several small vineyards on
the opposite side of the river, parts of which were known
by the name of "Seixo," meaning stony or pebbly. The
court held, that even conceding that, it did not justify the
defendant in adopting a device or brand, the probable effect
of which was to lead the public to suppose when purchasing
his wine, that they were purchasing the wine produced from
the plaintiff's vineyard.
Our whole case is summed up in Lord Langdale's language in Croft v. Day.t His lordship there says:
"No man has a right to sell his own goods as the goods of
another. You may express the same principle in different form,
and say that no man has a right to dress himself in colors, or

adopt and bear symbols to which he has no poculiar or exclusive
right, and thereby personate another person for the purpose of
inducing the public to suppose either that he is that other person, or that he is connected with, or selling the manufacture of
such other person, while he is really selling his own. It is perfectly manifest that to do these things is to commit a fraud, and
a very gross fraud."
But to establish the defendant's fraud and deceit, it is not
even necessary to show that he sells his coal as and for that
of the appellants. It is sufficient that he intentionally sells
it by the name which he knows the appellants had previously
adopted as the name of their coal.
Mr.11. E. Knox, contra, with a brief of Messrs. Fullerton,
Knox, and Rudd, relied on the following general propositions of law established by principle or by authorities, which
he cited.
1. That to constitute a trade-mark in a name, the name
must be either (1) an invented one, or (2) one which identifies
the maker with the article by indicating the person by whom
made, or the place at which made, in other words, the name
must be either a merely fancy name or a name indicating
ownership or origin.
2. That a person has no right to appropriate a name which
others may apply with equal truth, and have an equal right
to employ for the same purpose, such as a geographical
name, as in this case.
3. That the basis of the action of a court of equity to restrain the infringement of the right to a trade-mark isfraud
or iniposition on the part of the defendant, fraud as against
the plaintiff, or imposition on the public.
4. That the name must be used distinctively and exclusively
in order to give a title to it.
Mr. Justice STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.
The first and leading question presented by this case is
whether the complainants have an exclusive right to the
use of the words " Lackawanna coal," as a distinctive name

or trade-mark for the coal mined by them and transported
over their railroad and canal to market.
The averments of the bill* are supported by no inconsiderable evidence. The complainants were undoubtedly,
if not the first, among the first producers of coal from the
Lackawanna Valley, and the coal sent to market by them
has been generally known and designated as Lackawanna
coal. Whether the name "Lackawanna coal" was devised
or adopted by them as a trade-mark before it came into
common use is not so clearly established. On the contrary
the evidence shows that long before the complainants commenced their operations, and long before they had any existence as a corporation, the region of country in which
their mines were situated was called "The Lackawanna
Valley;" that it is a region of large dimensions, extending
along the Lackawanna River to its junction with the Susquehanna, embracing within its limits great bodies of coal
lands, upon a portion of which are the mines of the complainants, and upon other portions of which are the mines
of The Pennsylvania Coal Company, those of The Delaware,
Lackawanna, and Western Railroad Company, and those of
other smaller operators. The word "Lackawanna," then,
was not devised by the complainants. They found it a settled and known appellative of the district in which their
coal deposits and those of others were situated. At the
time when they began to use it, it was a recognized description of the region, and of course of the earths and minerals
in the region.
The bill alleges, however, not only that the complainants
devised, adopted, and appropriated the word, as a name or
trade-mark for their coal, but that it had never before been
used, or applied in combination with the word "coal," as a
name or trade-mark for any kind of coal, and it is the combination of the word Lackawanna with the word coal that
constitutes the trade-mark to the exclusive use of which
they assert a right.

CANAL COMPANY V. CLARK.

[Sup. Ot.

Opinion of the court.

It may be observed there is no averment that the other
.coal of the Lackawanna Valley differs at all in character or
quality from that mined on the complainants' lands. On
the contrary, the bill alleges that it cannot easily be distinguished therefrom by inspection. The bill is therefore an
attempt to secure to the complainants the exclusive use of
the name "Lackawanna coal," as applied, not to any manufacture of theirs, but to that portion of the coal of the Lackawanna Valley which they mine and send to market, differing neither in nature or quality from all other coal of the
same region.
Undoubtedly words or devices may be adopted as trademarks which are not original inventions of him who adopts
them, and courts of equity will protect him against any
fraudulent appropriation or imitation of them by others.
Property in a trade-mark, or rather in the use of a trademark or name, has very little analogy to that which exists
in copyrights, or in patents for inventions. Words in common use, with some exceptions, may be adopted, if, at the
time of their adoption, they were not employed to designate
the same, or like articles of production. The office of a
trade-mark is to point out distinctively the origin, or ownership of the article to which it is affixed; or, in other words,
to give notice who was the producer. This may, in many
cases, be done by a name, a mark, or a device well known,
but not previously applied to the same article.
But though it is not necessary that the word adopted as a
trade-name should be a new creation, never before known
or used, there are some limits to the right of selection. This
will be manifest when it is considered that in all cases where
rights to the exclusive use of a trade-mark are invaded, it is
invariably held that the essence of the wrong consists in the
sale of the goods of one manufacturer or vendor as those of
another; and that it is only when this false representation
is directly or indirectly made that the party who appeals to
a court of equity can have relief. This is the doctrine of all

CANAL

COMPANY IV. CLARK.

Opinion of the court.

the authorities.* Hence the trade-mark must either by itself, or by association, point distinctively to the origin or
ownership of the article t6 which it is applied. The reason
of this is that unless it does, neither can he who first adopted
it be injured by any appropriation or imitation of it by
others, nor can the public be deceived. The first appropriator of a name or device pointing to his ownership, or which,
by being associated with articles of trade, has acquired an
understood reference to the originator, or manufacturer of
the articles, is injured whenever another adopts the same
name or device for similar articles, because such adoption is
in effect representing falsely that the productions of the
latter are those of the former. Thus the custom and advantages to which the enterprise and skill of the first appropriator had given him a just right are abstracted for another's
use, and this is done by deceiving the public, by inducing
the public to purchase the goods and manufactures of one
person supposing them to be those of another. The trademark must therefore be distinctive in its original signification, pointing to the origin of the article, or it must have
become such by association. And there are two rules which
are not to be overlooked. No one can claim protection for
the exclusive use of a trade-mark or trade-name which would
practically give him a monopoly in the sale of any goods
other than those produced or made by himself. Ifhe could,
the public would be injured rather than protected, for competition would be destroyed. Nor can a generic name, or a
name merely descriptive of an article of trade, of its qualities,
ingredients, or characteristics, be employed as a trade-mark
and the exclusive use of it be entitled to legal protection.
As we said in the well-considered case of The Amoskeag
Manufacturing Company v. Spear,t "the owner of an original
trade-mark has an undoubted right to be protected in the

exclusive use of all the marks, forms, or symbols, that were
appropriated as designating the true origin or ownership of
the article or fabric to which they are affixed; but he has
no right to the exclusive use of any words, letters, figures,
or symbols, which have no relation to the origin or ownership of the goods, but are only meant to indicate their names
or quality. He has no right to appropriate a sign or a symbol, which, from the nature of the fact it is used to signify,
others may employ with equal truth, and therefore have an
equal right to employ for the same purpose."*
And it is obvious that the same reasons which forbid the
exclusive appropriation of generic names or of those merely
descriptive of the article manufactured and which can be
employed with truth by other manufacturers, apply with
equal force to the appropriation of geographical names, designating districts of country. Their nature is such that they
cannot point to the origin (personal origin) or ownership of
the articles of trade to which they may be applied. They
point only at the place of production, not to the producer,
and could they be appropriated exclusively, the appropriation would result in mischievous monopolies. Could such
phrases, as "Pennsylvania wheat," "Kentucky hemp," "Virginia tobacco," or "Sea Island cotton," be protected as trademarks; could any one prevent all others from using them, or
from selling articles produced in the districts they describe
under those appellations, it would greatly embarrass trade,
and secure exclusive rights to individuals in that which is the
common right of many. It can be permitted only when the
reasons that lie at the foundation of the protection given to
trade-marks are entirely overlooked. It cannot be said that
there is any attempt to deceive the public when one sells as
Kentucky hemp, or as Lehigh coal, that which in truth is
such, or that there is any attempt to appropriate the enter* Vide Wolfe v. Goulard, 18 Howard's Practice Reports, 64; Fetridge v.

prise or business reputation of another who may have previously sold his goods with the same description. It is not
selling one man's goods as and for those of another. Nothing is more common than that a manufacturer sends his
products to market, designating them by the name of the
place where they were made. But we think no case can be
found in which other producers of similar products in the
same place, have been restrained from the use of the same
name in describing their goods. It is true that in the case
of Brooklyn White Lead Company v. Masury,* where it appeared that the defendant (at first selling his product under
the name "Brooklyn white lead"), had added to the name
the word "Company" or "Co.," which made it an imitation
of the plaintiff's trade-mark, though he was not a company,
he was enjoined against the use of the added word. It was
a case of fraud. He had assumed a false name in imitation
of a prior true one, and with the obvious design of leading
the public to think his manufacture was that of the plaintiff
But the court said, as both the plaintiff and defendant dealt
in the same article, and both manufactured it at Brooklyn,
each had the same right to describe it as Brooklyn white
lead.
We have been referred by the plaintiffs to three decisions
which are supposed to justify the adoption of the name simply of a district or town, as a trade-mark.
One of these is Alvord v. Newman. There it appeared
that the complainants had been manufacturers of cement or
water-lime at Akron, from beds in the neighborhood of that
place, for about thirteen years, and that they had always
designated and sold their products as "Akron cement," and
"Akron water-lime." The defendants commenced a similar
business twelve years later, and manufactured cement from
quarries situated near Syracuse, in Onondaga County, and
called their product "Onondaga Alron cement, or waterlime." It was not in fact Akron cement (for Akron and
Syracuse were a long distance from each other), and the

purpose of calling it such was evidently to induce the public
to believe that it was the article made by the plaintiffs. The
act of the defendants was therefbre an attempted fraud, and
they were restrained from applying the word Akron to their
manufacture. But the case does not rule that any other
manufacturer at Akron might not have called his product
On the con"Akron cement," or "Akron water-lime."
trary, it substantially concedes that the plaintiffs by their
prior appropriation of the name of the town in connection
with the words cement and lime acquired no exclusive right
to its use, as against any one who could use it with truth.
MeAndrews v. _asseti is another case cited by tie complainants. The plaintiffs in that case were manufacturers
of liquorice made from roots and juice imported from Anatolia and Spain, and they sent their goods to market stamped
"Anatolia." Soon afterwards the defendants made to order
from a sample of the plaintiff's liquorice, other liquorice
which they also stamped "Anatolia." It was a clear case of
an attempt to imitate the mark previously existing, and to
put upon the market the new manufacture as that of the
first manufacturers. It does not appear, from the report of
the case, that the juice or roots from which the defendants'
article was made came from Anatolia. If not their mark
was false. Of course the Lord Chancellor enjoined them.
In answer to the argument that the word Anatolia was in
fact the geographical designation of a whole country, a word
common to all, and that therefore there could be no property
in it, he said, " Property in the word for all purposes cannot
exist; but property in that word as applied by way of stamp
upon a stick of liquorice does exist the moment a stick of
liquorice goes into the market so stamped and obtains acceptance and reputation in the market." It was not merely
the use of the word, but its application by way of stamp
upon each stick of liquorice that was protected. Nothing
in this case determines that a right to use the name of a
region of country as a trade-mark for an article may be acquired, to the exclusion of others who produce or sell a similar article coming from the same region.

Opinion of the court.

Nor is such a doctrine to be found in Seixav. Provezende,
the remaining case cited by the complainants. The case
turned upon an imitation of the plaintiff's device, which was
the figure of a coronet combined with the word Seixo, a word
which can hardly be said to havebeen the name of a district
of country. It means stony, and though applied to. two
estates, it was also the name of the plaintiff. Yet nothing
in the decision warrants the inference that the word Seixo
could alone become a trade-mark for any article, much less
that it could be protected as a trade-mark for any article to
the exclusion of its use in describing other articles coming
from the same estate.
It must then be considered as sound doctrine that no one
can apply the name of a district of country to a well-known
article of commerce, and obtain thereby such an exclusive
right to the application as to prevent others inhabiting the
district or dealing in similar articles coming from the district, from truthfully using the same designation. It is only
when the adoption or imitation of what is claimed to be a
trade-mark amounts to a false representation, express or implied, designed or incidental, that thece is any title to.relief
against it. True it may be that the use by a second producer, in describing truthfully his product, of a name or a
combination of words already in use by another, may have
the effect of causing the public to mistake as to the origin
or ownership of the product, but if it is just as true in its
application to his goods as it is to those of another who first
applied it, and who therefore claims an exclusive right to use
it, there is no legal or moral wrong done. Purchasers may
be mistaken, but they are not deceived by false representations, and equity will not enjoin against telling the truth.
These principles, founded alike on reason and authority,
are decisive of the present case, and they relieve us from
the consideration of much that was pressed upon us in the
argument. The defendant has advertised for sale and he is
selling coal not obtained from the plaintiffs, not mined or
brought to market by them, but coal which he purchased

from the Pennsylvania Coal Company, or from the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad Company. He
has advertised and sold it as Lackawanna coal. It is in Ifact
coal from the Lackawanna region. It is of the same quality
and of the same general appearance as that mined by the
complainants. It is taken from the same veins or strata.
It is truly described by the term Lackawanna coal, as is the
coal of plaintiffs. The description does not point to its
origin or ownership, nor indicate in the slightest degree the
person, natural or artificial, who mined the coal or brought
it to market. All the coal taken from that region is known
and has been known for years by the trade, and rated in
public statistics as Lackawanna coal. True the Delaware,
Lackawanna, and Western Railroad Company have sometimes called their coal Scranton coal, and sometimes Scranton coal from the Lackawanna, and the Pennsylvania Coal
Company have called theirs Pittston coal, thus referring to
the parts of the region in which they mine. But the generic
name, the comprehensive name for it all is Lackawanna coal.
In all the coal regions there are numerous collieries, owned
and operated by different proprietors, yet the product is
truly and rightfully described as Schuylkill, Lehigh, or
Lackawanna coal, according to the region from which it
comes. We are therefore of opinion that the defendant has
invaded no right to which the plaintiffs can maintain a claim.
By advertising and selling coal brought from the Lackawanna Valley as Lackawanna coal, he has made no false
representation, and we see no evidence that he has attempted
to sell his coal as and for the coal of the plaintiffs. If the
public are led into mistake, it is by the truth, not by any
false pretence. If the complainants' sales are diminished, it
is because they are not the only producers of Lackawanna
coal, and not because of any fraud of the defendant. The
decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the bill must, therefore, be
AFFIRMED.
