TARBLE'S CASE.
1. The government of the United States and the government of a State are
distinct and independent of each other within their respective spheres
of action, although existing and exercising their powers within the
same territorial limits. Neither government can intrude within the
jurisdiction, or authorize any interference therein by its judicial officers
with the action of the other. But whenever any conflict arises between
the enactments of the two sovereignties, or in the enforcement of their
asserted authorities, those of the national government have supremacy
until the validity of the different enactments and authorities are determined by the tribunals of the United States.
2. A State judge has no jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas corpus, or to
continue proceedings under the writ when issued, for the discharge of a
person held under the authority, or claim and color of the authority, of
the United States by an officer of that government. If upon. the application for the writ it appear that the party, alleged to be illegally restrained of his liberty, is held under the authority, or claim and color
of the authority, of the United States, by an officer of that government,
the writ should be refused. If this fact do not thus appear, the State
judge has the right to inquire into the cause of imprisonment, and ascertain by what authority the person is held within the limits of the State;
and it is the duty of the marshal, or other officer having the custody of
the prisoner, to give, by a proper return, information in this respect.
But after he is fully apprised by the return that the party is held by an
officer of the United States, under the authority, or claim and color of
the authority of the United States, he can proceed no further.
3. These principles applied to a case where a habeas corpus was issued by a
court commissioner of one of the counties of Wisconsin to a recruiting
officer of the United States, to bring before him a person who had enlisted as a soldier in the army of the United States, and whose discharge
was sought on the alleged ground that he was a minor under the age of
eighteen years at the time of his enlistment, and that he enlisted without the consent of his father. The petition for the writ alleging that
the prisoner bad enlisted as a soldier and been mustered into the military service of the national government, and was detained by the officer
as such soldier-this court held that the court commissioner had no
jurisdiction to issue the writ for the discharge of the prisoner, as it thus
appeared upon the petition that the prisoner was detained under claim
and color of the authority of the United States by an officer of that
government; and that if he was illegally detained, it was for the courts
or judicial officers of 'the United States and for those courts or officers
alone to grant him release.

of one Edward Tarble, held in the custody of a recruiting
officer of the United States as an enlisted soldier, on the
alleged ground that he was a minor, under the age of eighteen years at the time of his enlistment, and that he enlisted
without the consent of his fIther.
The writ was issued on the 10th of August, 1869, by a
court commissioner of Dane County, Wisconsin, an officer
authorized by the laws of that State to issue the writ of
habeas corpus upon the petition of parties imprisoned or
restrained of their liberty, or of persons on their behalf. It
was issued in this case upon the petition of the fitther of
Tarble, in which lie alleged that his son, who had enlisted
under the name of Frank Brown, was confined and restrained of his liberty by Lieutenant Stone, of the United
States army, in the city of Madison, in that State and
county; that the cause of his confinement and restraint was
that he had, on the 20th of the preceding July, enlisted, and
been mustered into the military service of the United States;
that he was under the age of eighteen years at the time of
such enlistment; that the same was made without the knowledge, consent, or approval of the petitioner; and was. therefore, as the petitioner was advised and believed, illegal; and
that the petitioner was lawfully entitled to the custody, care,
and services of his son.
The writ was directed to the officer thus named, commanding him to have Tarble, together with the cause of his
imprisonment and detention, before the commissioner, at
the latter's office, in the city of Madison, immediately after
the receipt of the writ.
The officer thereupon produced Tarble before the commissioner and made a return in writing to the writ, protesting that the commissioner had no jurisdiction in the premises, and stating, as the authority and cause for the detention of the prisoner, that he, the officer, was a first lieutenant
in the army of the United States, and by due authority was
detailed as a recruiting officer at the city of Madison, in the
State of Wisconsin, and as such officer had the custody and
command of all soldiers recruited fbr the army at that city;

Statement of the case.

that on the 27th of July preceding, the prisoner, under the
name of Frank Brown, was regularly enlisted as a soldier in
the army of the United States for the period of five years,
unless sooner discharged by proper authority; that he then
duly took the oath required in such case by law and the
regulations of the army, in which oath he declared that he
was of the age of twenty-one years, and thereby procured
his enlistment, and was on the same day duly mustered into
the service of the United States; that subsequently he deserted the service, and being retaken was then in custody
and confinement under charges of desertion, awaiting trial
by the proper military authorities.
To this return the petitioner filed a reply, denying, on
information and belief; that the prisoner was ever duly or
lawfully enlisted or mustered as a soldier into the army of
the United States, or that he had declared on oath that he
was of the age of twenty-one years, and alleging that the
prisoner was at the time of his enlistment under the age of
eighteen years, and on information and belief that he was
enticed into the enlistment, which was without the knowledge, consent, or approval of the petitioner; that the only
oath taken by the prisoner at the time of his enlistment was
an oath of allegiance; and that the petitioner was advised
and believed that the prisoner was not, and never had been,
a deserter from the military service of the United States.
On the 12th of August, to which day the hearing of the
petition was adjourned, the commissioner proceeded to take
the testimony of different witnesses produced before him,
which related principally to the enlistment of the prisoner,
the declarations which he made as to his age, and the oath
he took at the time, his alleged desertion, the charges
against him, his actual age, and the absence of any consent
to the enlistment on the part of his father.
The commissioner, after argument, held that the prisoner
was illegally imprisoned and detained by Lieutenant Stone,
and commanded that officer forthwith to discharge him from
custody.
Afterwards, in September of the same year, that officer

applied to the Supreme Court of the State for a certiorari,
setting forth in his application the proceedings befbre the
commissioner and his ruling thereon. The certiorari was
allowed, and in obedience to it the proceedings had before
the commissioner were returned to the Supreme Court.
These proceedings consisted of the petition for the writ, the
return of the officer, the reply of the petitioner, and the testimony, documentary and parol, produced before the commissioner.
Upon these proceedings the case was duly argued before
the Supreme Court, and in April, 1870, that tribunal pronounced its judgment, affirming the order of the commissioner discharging the prisoner. This judgment was now
before this court for examination on writ of error prosecuted
by the United States.
The opinion of the court below was sent up with the transcript of the record in the case. It went largely and elaborately into the grounds of its judgment. The sacredness of
the right to personal liberty, and " the high, searching, and
imperative character" of the writ of habeas corpus were presented and enforced. The right of any State court to liberate a party in custody under sentence of the Federal courts,
when such Federal court had jurisdiction, was not, indeed,
asserted, even where the Federal court might err in what it
did; but, contrariwise, such right by any State court was
disclaimed. But the right of the State courts to decide
whether the Federal court had jurisdiction to pass upon the
subject at all, was considered by the court below as perfectly
within its competence to pass upon ; and, if on full consideration of the case, the State court was satisfied that the Federal court had no jurisdiction at all in the matter, in such a
case the court below asserted that the duty of the State court
was to disregard what the Federal court had done. The
court below, in illustration of its position, said:
"This court (the Supreme Court of Wisconsin), in a civil
suit, recently passed on the jurisdiction of the Federal court to
render a decree for the sale of a railroad on the tbreelosure of a
mortgage. There was no suggestion from any quarter that in

doing so it was exercising any unwarrantable or unusual power,
or assuming any authority to control, revise, or annul the judgments of that court. _Nor was it. It is a power constantly exercised by all courts. But it is precisely the safihe power that
is exercised in a proceeding by habeas corpus when the validity
of a judgment under which the party is imprisoned is drawn in
question. A judgment in a civil suit disposes of the title to
property. A judgment in a criminal suit disposes of the prisoner's right to liberty. A civil suit involving the title to that
property is the appropriate proceeding in which the jurisdiction
of the court to render the one judgment may be drawn in question collaterally. A proceeding by habeas corpus may appropriately have the same effect as to the other. But the right of the
State court to decide on the validity of the judgment in the
latter case is as clear as its right in the'former. It rests upon
the same principles and stands or falls by the same reasoning."
Mr. B. I. Bristow, Solicitor-General, contra, and for the
United States, cited as conclusive the cases of Ableman v. Booth
and United States v. Booth, in this court,* in which cases the
action of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin-the same court
to which the writ of error in the present case had gone-in
disregarding the action of the Federal courts or their officers
under the act of Congress known as the Fugitive Slave Law
-because, as the Wisconsin court held, the act was unconstitutional and void, and could therefore give the Federal
court no jurisdiction-was overruled, and itself held unconstitutional and void.
The present case, Mr. Bristow argued, was covered in principle by the decisions cited, and those decisions had been
applied in instance by several State courts to the case of an
enlisted soldier in the army of the United States.t
Mr. Justice FIELD, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court, as follows:

TARBLE'S CASE.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

a State court commissioner has jurisdiction, upon habeas
corpus, to inquire into the validity of the eiilistment or soldiers into the military service of the United States, and to
discharge them from such service when, in his judgment,
their enlistment has not been made in conformity with the
laws of the United States. The question presented may be
more generally stated thus: Whether any judicial officer of
a State has jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas cormpus, or to
continue proceedings under the writ when issued, for the
discharge of a person held under the authority, or claim and
color of the authority, of the United States, by an officer of
that government. For it is evident, if such jurisdiction may
be exercised by any judicial officer of a State, it may be exercised by the court commissioner within the county for
which he is appointed; and if it may be exercised with reference to soldiers detained in the military service of the United
States, whose enlistment is alleged to have been illegally
made, it may be exercised with reference to persons employed in any other department of the public service when
their illegal detention is asserted. It may be exercised in
all cases where parties are held under the authority of the
United States, whenever the invalidity of the exercise of
that authority is affirmed. The jurisdiction, if it exist at
all, can only be limited in its application by the legislative
power of the State. It may even reach to parties imprisoned under sentence of the National courts, after regular indictment, trial, and conviction, for offences against the laws
of the United States. As we read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in this case, this is the claim of
authority asserted by that tribunal for itself and for the judicial officers of that State. It does, indeed, disclaim any
right of either to interfere with parties in custody, under
judicial sentence, when the National court pronouncing seutence had jurisdiction to try and punish the offenders, but
it asserts, at the same time, for itself and for each of those
officers, the right to determine, upon habeas corputs, in all
cases, whether that court ever had sneh jurisdiction. Ini the
case of Booth, which subsequently came before this court,

it not only sustained the action of one of its justices in discharging a prisoner held in custody by a marshal of the
United States, under a warrant of commitment for an offence
against the laws of the United States, issued by a commissioner of the United States; but it discharged the same
prisoner when subsequently confined under sentence of the
District Court of the United States for the same offence,
after indictment, trial, and conviction, on the ground that,
in its judgment, the act of Congress creating the 6ffe ce was
unconstitutional; and in order that its decision in that respect should be final and conclusive, directed its clerk to
refuse obedience to the writ of error issued by this court,
under the act of Congress, to bring up the decision for review.,
It is evident, as said by this court when the case of Booth
was finally brought before it, if the power asserted by that
State court existed, no offence against the laws of the United
States could be punished by their own tribunals, without the
permission and according to the judgment of the courts of
the State in which the parties happen to be imprisoned; that
if that power existed in that State court, it belonged equally
to every other State court in the Union where a prisoner was
within its territorial limits; and, as the different State courts
could not always agree, it would often happen that an act,
which was admitted to be an offence and justly punishable
in one State, would be regarded as innocent, and even praiseworthy in another, and no one could suppose that a government, which had hitherto lasted for seventy years, "enforcing
its laws by its own tribunals, and preserving the union of the
States, could have lasted a single year, or fulfilled the trusts
committed to it, if offences against its laws could not have
been punished without the consent of the State in which
the culprit was found."
The decision of this court in the two cases which grew
out of the arrest of Booth, that of Ableman v. Booth, and that
of The United States v. Booth,* disposes alike of the claim of
*

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

jurisdiction by a State court, or by a State judge, to interfere with the authority of the United States, whether that
authority be exercised by a Federal officer or be exercised
by a Federal tribunal. In the first of these cases Booth had
been arrested and committed to the custody of a marshal of
theUnited States by a commissioner appointed by the District
Court of the United States, upon a charge of having aided
and abetted the escape of a fugitive slave. Whilst thus in
custody a justice of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued
a writ of habeas corpus directed to the marshal, requiring him
to produce the body of Booth with the cause of his imprisonment. The marshal made a return, stating that he held
the prisoner upon the warrant of the commissioner, a copy
of which he annexed to and returned with the writ. TO
this return Booth demurred as insufficient in law to justify
his detention, and, upon the hearing which followed, the
justice held his detention illegal, and ordered his discharge.
-The marshal thereupon applied for and obtained a cerliorari,
and had the proceedings removed to the Supreme Court of
the State, where, after argument, the order of the justice
discharging the prisoner from custody was affirmed. The
decision proceeded upon the ground that the act of Congress
respecting fugitive slaves was unconstitutional and void.
In the second case, Booth had been indicted for the offence
with which he was charged befbre the commissioner, and
from which the State judge had discharged him, and had
been tried and convicted in the District Court of the United
States for the District of Wisconsin, and been sentenced to
pay a fine of $1000, and to be imprisoned for one month.
Whilst in imprisonment, in execution of this sentence, application was made by Booth to the Supreme Court of the
State, for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging in his application
that his imprisonment was illegal, by reason of the unconstitutionality of the fugitive slave law, and that the District
Court had no jurisdiction to try or punish him for the matter
charged against him. The court granted the application,
and issued the writ, to which the sheriff, to whom the prisoner had been committed by the marshal, returned that he

held the prisoner by virtue of the proceedings and sentence
of the District Court, a copy of which was annexed to his
return. Upon demurrer to this return, the court adjudged
the imprisonment of Booth to be illegal, and ordered 'him
to be discharged from custody, and he was accordingly set
at liberty.
For a review in this court of the judgments in both of
these cases, writs of error were prosecuted. No return,
however, was made to the writs, the clerk of the Supreme
Court of Wisconsin having been directed by that cour.t to
refuse obedience to them; but copies of the records were
filed by the Attorney-General, and it was ordered by this
court that they should be received with the same effect and
legal operation as if returned by the clerk. The cases were
afterwards heard and considered together, and the decision
of both was announced in the same opinion. In that opinion
the Chief Justice details the facts of the two cases at length,
and comments upon the character of the jurisdiction asserted
by the State judge and the State court; by the State judge
to supervise and annul the proceedings of a commissioner
of the United States, and to discharge a prisoner committed
by him for an offence against the laws of the United States;
and by the State court to supervise and annul the proceedings and judgment of a District Court of the United States,
and to discharge a prisoner who had been indicted, tried,
and found guilty of an offence against the laws of the United
States and sentenced to imprisonment by that court.
And in answer to this assumption of judicial power by
the judges and by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin thus
made, the Chief Justice said as follows: If they "possess
the jurisdiction they claim, they must derive it either from
the United States or the State. It certainly has not been
conferred on them by the United States; and it is equally
clear it was not in the power of the State to confer it, even
if it had attempted to do so; for no State can authorize one
of its judges or courts to exercise judicial power, by habeas
corpus or otherwise, within the jurisdiction of another and
independent government. And although the 'State of Wis-

TARBLE'S CASE.

[SLIP. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

cousin is sovereign within its territorial limits to a certain
extent, yet that sovereignty is limited and restricted by the
Constitution of the United States. And the powers of the
General government and of the State, although both exist
and are exercised within the same territorial limits, are yet
separate and distinct sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each other, within their respective spheres.
And the sphere of action appropriated to the United States,
is as far beyond the reach of the judicial process issued by
a State judge or a State court, as if the line of division was
traced by landmarks and monuments visible to the eye.
And the State of Wisconsin had no more power to authorize these proceedings of its judges and courts, than it would
have had if the prisoner had been confined in Michigan, or
in any other State of the Union, for an offence against the
laws of the State in which he was imprisoned.'"
It is in the consideration of this distinct and independent
character of the government of the United States, from that
of the government of the several States, that the solution of
the question presented in this case, and in similar cases,
must be found. There are within the territorial limits of
each State two governments, restricted in their spheres of
action, but independent of each other, and supreme within
their respective spheres. Each has its separate departments;
each has its distinc*t laws, and each has its own tribunals for
their enforcement. Neither government can intrude within
the jurisdiction, or authorize any interference therein by its
judicial officers with the action of the other. The two governments in each State stand in their respective spheres of
action in the same independent relation to each other, except in one particular, that they would if their authority
embraced distinct territories. That particular consists in
the supremacy of the authority of the United States when
any conflict arises between the two governments. The Constitution and the laws passed in pursuance of it, are declared
by the Constitution itself to be the supreme law of the land,
and the judges of every State are bound thereby, "anything
in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary not-

Opinion of the court.

withstanding." Whenever, therefore, any conflict arises between the enactments of the two sovereignties, or in the
enforcement of their asserted authorities, those of the National government must have supremacy until the validity
of the different enactments and authorities can be finally
determined by the tribunals of the United States. This
temporary supremacy until judicial decision by the National
tribunals, and the ultimate determination of the conflict by
such decision, are essential to the preservation of order and
peace, and the avoidance of forcible collision between the
two governments. "The Constitution," as said by Mr.
Chief Justice Taney, "was not framed merely to guard the
States against danger from abroad, but chiefly to secure
union and harmony at home; and to accomplish this end it
was deemed necessary, when the Constitution was framed,
that many of the rights of sovereignty which the States then
possessed should be ceded to the General government; and
that in the sphere of action assigned to it, it should be supreme and strong enough to execute its own laws by its own
tribunals, without interruption from a State, or from State
authorities." And the judicial power conferred extends to
all cases arising under the Constitution, and thus embraces
every legislative act of Congress, whether passed in pursuance of it, or in disregard of its provisions. The Constitution is under the view of the tribunals of the United States
when any act of Congress is brought before them for consideration.
Such being the distinct and independent character of the
two governments, within their respective spheres of action,
it follows that neither can intrude with its judicial process,
into the domain of the other, except so far as such intrusion
may be necessary on the part of the National government to
preserve its rightful supremacy in cases of conflict of authority. In their laws, and mode of enforcement, neither is
responsible to the other. How their respective laws shall
be enacted; how they shall be carried into execution; and
in what tribunals, or by what officers; and how much discretion, or whether any at all shall be vested in their officers,

TARBLE'S CASE.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

are matters subject to their own control, and in the regulation of which neither can interfere with the other.
Now, among the powers assigned to the National government, is the power "to raise and support armies," and the
power "to provide for the government and regulation of the
land and naval forces." The execution of these powers falls
within the line of its duties; and its control over the subject
is plenary and exclusive. It can determine, without question from any State authority, how the armies shall be raised,
whether by voluntary enlistment or forced draft, the age at
which the soldier shall be received, and the period for which
he shall be taken, the compensation he shall be allowed,
and the service to which he shall be assigned. And it can
provide the rules for the government and regulation of the
forces after they are raised, define what shall constitute military offences, and prescribe their punishment. No interference with the execution of this power of the National government in the formation, organization, and government of
its armies by any State officials could be permitted without
greatly impairing the efficiency, if it did not utterly destroy,
this branch of the public service. Probably in every county
and city in the several States there are one or more officers
authorized by law to issue writs of habeas eorpum on behalf
of persons alleged to be illegally restrained of their liberty;
and if soldiers could be taken from the army of the United
States, and the validity of their enlistment inquired into by
any one of these officers, such proceeding could be taken by
all of them, and no movement could be made by the National
troops without their commanders being subjected to constant annoyance and embarrassment from this source. The
experience of the late rebellion has shown us that, in times
of great popular excitement, there may be found in every
State large numbers ready and anxious to embarrass the
operations of the government, and easily persuaded to believe every step taken for the enforcement of its authority
illegal and void. Power to issue writs of habeas corpas for
the discharge of soldiers in the military service, in the hands
of parties thus disposed, might be used, and often would be

used, to the great detriment of the public service. In many
exigencies the measures of the National government might
in this way be entirely bereft of their efficacy and value. An
appeal in such cases to this court, to correct the erroneous
action of these officers, would afford no adequate remedy.
Proceedings on habeas corpus are summary, and the delay
incident to bringing the decision of a State officer, through
the highest tribunal of the .State, to this court for review,
would necessarily occupy years, and in the meantime, where
the soldier was discharged, the mischief would be accomplished. It is manifest that the powers of the National government could not be exercised with energy and efficiency
at all times, if its acts could be interfered with and controlled for any period by officers or tribunals of another
sovereignty.
It is true similar embarrassment might sometimes be occasioned, though in a less degree, by the exercise of the authority to issue the writ possessed by judicial officers of the
United States, but the ability to provide a speedy remedy
for any inconvenience following from this source would
always exist with the National legislature.
State judges and State courts, authorized by laws of their
States to issue writs of habeas corpus, have undoubtedly a
right to issue the writ in any case where a party is alleged
to be illegally confined within their limits, unless it appear
upon his application that he is confined under the authority,
or claim and. color of the autlority, of the United States, by
an officer of that government. If such fact appear upon the
application the writ should be refused. If it do not appear,
the judge or court issuing the writ has a right to inquire
into the cause of imprisonment, and ascertain by what authority the person is held within the limits of the State;
and it is the duty of the marshal, or other officer having the
custody of the prisoner, to give, by a proper return, information in this respect. His return should be sufficient, in its
detail of facts, to show distinctly that the imprisonment is
under the authority, or claim and color of the authority, of
the United States, and to exclude the suspicion of imposition

or oppression on his part. And the process or orders, under
which the prisoner is held, should be produced with the return and submitted to inspection, in order that the court or
judge issuing the writ may see that the prisoner is held by
the officer, in good faith, under the authority, or claim and
color of the authority, of the United States, and not under
the mere pretence of having such authority.
This right to inquire by process of habeas corpus, and the
duty of the officer to make a return, "grows necessarily,"
says Mr. Chief Justice Taney, "out of the complex character
of our government and the existence of two distinct and
separate sovereignties within the same territorial space, each
of them restricted in its power, and each within its sphere
of action, prescribed by the Constitution of the United
States, independent of the other. But, after the return is
made, and the State judge or court judicially apprised that
the party is in custody under the authority of the United
States, they can proceed no further. They then know that
the prisoner is within the dominion and jurisdiction of another government, and that neither the writ of habeas corpus
nor any other process issued under State authority can pass
over the line of division between the two sovereign ties. He
is then within the dominion and exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States. If he has committed an offence against their
laws, their tribunals alone can punish him. If he is wrongfully imprisoned, their judicial tribunals can release him and
afford him redress."
Some attempt has been made in adjudications, to which
our attention has been called, to limit the decision of this
court in Ableman v. Booth, and The United States v. Booth, to
cases where a prisoner is held in custody under undisputed
lawful authority of the United States, as distinguished fromi
his imprisonment under claim and color of such authority.
But it is evident that the decision does not admit of any
such limitation. It would have been unnecessary to enforce, by any extended reasoning, such as the Chief Justice
uses, the position that when it appeared to the judge or officer issuing the writ, that the prisoner was held under undis-

puted lawful authority, he should proceed no further. No
Federal judge even could, in such case, release the-party
from imprisonment, except upon bail when that was allowable. The detention being by admitted lawful authority, no
judge could set the prisoner at liberty, except in that way,
at any stage of the proceeding. All that is meant by the
language used is, that the State judge or State court should
proceed no further when it appears, from the application of
the party, or the return made, that the prisoner is held by
an officer of the United States under what, in truth, purports to be the authority of the United States; that is, an
authority, the validity of which is to be determined by the
Constitution and laws of the United States. If a party thus
held be illegally imprisoned it is for the courts or judicial
officers of the United States, and those courts or officers
alone, to grant him release.
This limitation upon the power of State tribunals and
State officers furnishes no just ground to apprehend that
the liberty of the citizen will thereby be endangered. The
United States are as much interested in protecting the citizen from illegal restraint under their authority, as the several
States are to protect him from the like restraint under their
authority, and are no nmore likely to tolerate any oppression.
Their courts and judicial officers are clothed with the power
to issue the writ of habeas corpus in all cases, where a party
is illegally restrained of his liberty by an officer of the United
States, whether such illegality consist in the character of the
process, the authority of the officer, or the invalidity of the
law under which he is held. And there is no just reason to
believe that they will exhibit any hesitation to exert their
power, when it is properly invoked. Certainly there can be
no ground for supposing that their action will be less prompt
and efficient in such cases than would be that of State tribunals and State officers.*

to issue the writ of habeas corpus for the discharge of the
prisoner in this case, it appearing, upon the application presented to him for the writ, that the prisoner was held by an
officer of the United States, under claim and color of the
authority of the United States, as an enlisted soldier mustered into the military service of the National government;
and the same information was imparted to the commissioner
by the return of the officer. The commissioner was, both
by the application for the writ and the return to it, apprised
that the prisoner was within the dominion and jurisdiction
of another government, and that no writ of habeas corpus
issued by him could pass over the line which divided the
two sovereignties.
The conclusion we have reached renders it unnecessary
to consider how far the declaration of the prisoner as to his
age, in the oath of enlistment, is to be deemed conclusive
evidence on that point on the return to the writ.
JUDGMENT REVERSED.

The CHIEF JUSTICE, dissenting
I cannot concur in the opinion just read. I have no doubt
of the right of a State court to inquire into the jurisdiction
of a Federal court upon habeas corpits, and to discharge when
satisfied that the petitioner for the writ is restrained of liberty by the sentence of a court without jurisdiction. If it
errs in deciding the question of jurisdiction, the error must
be corrected in the mode prescribed by the 25th section of
the Judiciary Act; not by denial of the right to make inquiry.
I have still less doubt, if possible, that a writ of habeas
corpus may issue from a State court to inquire into the
validity of imprisonment or detention, without the sentence
of any court whatever, by an officer of the United States.
The State court may err; and if it does, the error may be
corrected here. The mode has been prescribed and should
be followed.
To deny the right of State courts to issue the writ, or,
what amounts to the same thing, to concede the right to

KITCHEN v. BEDFORD.
Statement of the case.

issue and to deny the right to adjudicate, is to deny the
right to protect the citizen by habeas corpus against arbitrary
imprisonment in a large class of cases; and, I am thoroughly
persuaded, was never within the contemplation of the Convention which framed, or the people who adopted, the Constitution. That instrument expressly declares that "the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,
unless when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public
safety may require it."

KITCHEN v. BEDFORD.
1. Where a person acknowledged the receipt of "the sum of $119,000 in
bonds" of a railroad company, and of "50,405 dollars of coupons,"
amounting in the aggregate to "the sum of $169,405," " which said sum
he promised to expend in the purchase of lands" of that same railroad
company, "at or near the average price of $5 per acre;" held, that this
was a trust to buy the lands with the bonds at or near the price of $5
an acre; and not to buy them with the proceeds of the bonds after they
were sold at a nominal price.
2. Purchasers who fraudulently purchased, in breach of the trust, held liable
in trover.
8. The statute law of Arkansas has not changed the common law rule, that
a husband cannot legally make a gift to his wife during coverture.
4. Where a husband has not parted with the legal title to bonds of which
he may have made an equitable gift for his wife's benefit, he can call
any person to account who unlawfully converts them.

ERROR to the Circuit Court for the District of Missouri.
Kitchen, a citizen of Arkansas, brought trover in the
court below against a certain Bedford and one Webber, for
the conversion of one hundred and nineteen bonds of the
Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, for $1000 each, dated
October 1st, 1857, and payable in New York in 1882, with
semi-annual interest represented by interest warrants annexed to the bonds. The conversion was laid as on the 1st
of December, 1866. Plea, "Not guilty." A jury being
waived, the cause was tried by the court in May, 1870, and
