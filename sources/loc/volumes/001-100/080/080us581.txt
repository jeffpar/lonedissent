UNITED STATES.

Statement of the case.

BLYEW ET AL. V. UNITED STATES.
Under the act of 9th April, 1866 (14 Stat. at Large, 27), sometimes called
i The Civil :Rights Bill," which gives jurisdiction to the Circuit Court
of all causes, civil and criminal, affecting persons who qre denied or
eannot enforce in the courts of the State or locality where they may be,
any of the rights given by the act (among which is the right to give
evidence, and to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings
for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens),
a criminal prosecution is not to be considered as "affecting" mere witnesses in the case, nor any person not in existence. United States v.
Ortega (6 Wheaton, 467), affirmed.

ERILoR to the Circuit Court for the District of Kentucky;

the case being this:
By the Revised Statutes of Kentucky, published A.D.
1860,* it is enacted:
"That a slave, negro, or Indian, shall be a competent witness
in the case of the commonwealth for or against a slave, negro,
or Indian, or in a civil case to which only negroes or Indians
are parties, but in no other case."

This enactment being in force in Kentucky, the thirteentlh
amendment to the Constitution was proclaimed as having
been duly ratified, and a part of it, December 18th, 1865,t
is in these words:
"SEcTIoN

1. INeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, ex-

cept as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have
been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or
any place subject to their jurisdiction.
"SECTIoN 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article

by appropriatelegislation."
In this state of things, Congress on the 9th April, 1866,
passed an act entitled "An act to protect all persons in the
United States in their civil rights, and furnish the means of
their vindication."I The first section of that act declared all

persons born in the United States, and not subject to any
foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, to be citizens of
the United States, and it enacted that:
"Such citizens, of every race and color, shall have the same
right in every State and Territory in the United States to make
and enforc6 contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal
property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings
for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens,
and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties, and
to none other, any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom
to the contrary notwithstanding."
The second section enacted:
" That any person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any inhabitant of any State or Territory to the deprivation of any right, secured or protected by this act, or to different
punishment, pains, or penalties, on account of such person having
at any time been held in a condition of slavery, or involuntary
servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party
shall have been duly convicted, or by reason of his color, or
race, than is prescribed for the punishment of white persons,
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, on conviction thereof, be punished," &c.
Then followed the third section, which contains this enactment:
"That the District Courts of the United States, within their
respective districts, shall have, exclusively of the courts of the
several States, cognizance of all crimes and offences committed
against the provisions of this act, and also concurrently with the
Circuit Courts of the United States, of all causes, civil and criminal,
affecting persons who are denied, or cannot enforce in the courts
or judicial tribunals of the State, or locality, where they may
be, any of the rights secured to them by the first section of the
act."
The section then provided for removal into the Federal
courts of any suit or prosecution, civil or criminal, which

had been, or might hereafter be, commenced against any
such person for any cause whatever.
The sixth section rendered liable to fine and imprisonment
any person who should obstruct an officer or other person
in execution of process under the act, or should aid a-person
arrested to escape, or conceal a person for whose arrest a
warrant had been issued.
In this state of things, two persons, Blyew and Kennard,
were indicted October 7th, 1868, in the Circuit Court for the
District of Kentucky, for the murder, on the 29th of August
preceding, within that district, of a colored woman named
Lucy Armstrong.* The indictment contained three counts,
all of them charging the murder in the usual form of indictments for that offence, and with sufficient certainty. But, in
order to show jurisdiction in the Circuit Court of the United
States, an averment was made in the first count that the
said Lucy Armstrong was a citizen of the United States,
having been ,born therein, and not subject to any foreign
power; that she was of the African race, and was above the
age of seventy-five years; that Blyew and Kennard (the persons indicted) were white persons, each of them at the time
of the alleged killing and murder above the age of eighteen
years; that the said killing and murder, done and committed,
as averred, were seen and witnessed by one Richard Foster,
and one Laura Foster, citizens of the 'United States, having
been born therein and not subject to any foreign power,
both of the African race; and that the said Lucy Armstrong,
Richard Foster, and Laura Foster were then and there denied the right to testify against the said iBlyew and Kennard,
or either of them, concerning the said killing and murder,
in the courts and judicial tribunals of the State of Kentucky,
solely on account of their race and color. The second and
third counts contained substantially the same averments.
To this indictment the defendants pleaded specially that
before it was found they had been in custody of the author* The murder and indictment were, it seems, after the ratification of the
fourteenth amendment, which was proclaimed July 20th, 1868. (15 Stat. at
Large, 708.)

Statement of the case.

ities of the State, and, after examination, had been held to
answer for the killing of Lucy Armstrong, which was the
same offence as that charged in the Circuit Court; but on
demurrer the plea was overruled, and the case went to trial
upon the issues found by a replication to the plea of not

guilty. During the progress of the trial the court sealed
several exceptions to the admission of evidence offered by
the United States, and a verdict of guilty having been returned, a motion was made in arrest of judgment, which
the court also overruled. The ground alleged for this motion was, that "the facts stated in the indictment did not
constitute a public offence within the jurisdiction of the
court."
There were thus three questions presented by the record:
First. Whether the Circuit Court had jurisdiction of the
offence charged in the indictment ?
Second. Whether the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the defendants' special plea ?
Third. Whether the evidence to which the defendants objected should have been received ?
Of course, if the first question was resolved in the negative, any resolution of the remaining ones became unnecessary.
The case was brought here on error under the tenth section of the already mentioned act of Congress, which provides "that, upon all questions of law arising in any cause
under the provisions of this act, a final appeal may be taken
to the Supreme Court of the United States."
The murder for which the defendants were convicted,
and as they now sought to show illegally, had been one of
peculiar atrocity. A number of witnesses testified that on
a summer evening of 1868 (August 29th), towards eleven
6'clock, at the cabin of a colored man named Jack Foster,
there were found the dead bodies of the said Jack, of Sallie
Foster, his wife, and of Lucy Armstrong, for the murder of

whom Blyew and Kennard stood convicted; this person, a
blind woman, over ninety years old, and the mother of Mrs.

Argument against the jurisdiction.

Foster; all persons of color; their bodies yet warm. Lucy
Armstrong was wounded in the head; her head cut open as
with a broad-axe. Jack Foster and Sallie, his wife, were cut
in several places, almost to pieces. Richard Foster, a son
of Jack, who was in his seventeenth year, was found about
two hundred yards from the house of his father, at the house
of a Mr. Nichols, whither he had crawled from the house of
his father, mortally wounded by an instrument corresponding to one used in the killing of Lucy Armstrong, Jack and
Sallie Foster. He died two days afterwards from the effects
of his wounds aforesaid, having made a dying declaration
tending to fix the crime on Blyew and Kennard. Two young
children, girls, one aged ten years and the other thirteen
(this -last, the Laura Foster above mentioned), asleep in a
trundle-bed, escaped, and the latter was a witness on the
trial.
Evidence was produced on the part of the United States,
that a short time previous to the murder, Kennard was
heard to declare, in presence of Blyew, "that he (Kennard)
thought there would soon be another war about the niggers;
that when it did come he intended to go to killing niggers,
and he was not sure that he would not begin his work of
killing them before the war should actually commence."
Such a case, and the withdrawal of it from the State
courts, naturally excited great interest throughout the State
of Kentucky, and by a joint resolution of the General Assembly of that State, passed at its adjourned session in 1869,
the governor of the State was directed to cause the commonwealth above mentioned to be represented in this court.
Being brought here the case was very fully and interestingly argued; the point to which counsel here addressed
themselves chiefly being the one already stated as the first
one presented by the record, the point of the jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court.

of Kentucky and.witbin her limits; that it was an insult to

her dignity and an outrage on the peace of a community
which, by the organic law of the land, was placed under her
sole protection; that her law was offended by it, and that
none but she had a right to enter into judgment with the
perpetrators of it; that no other state, sovereignty, prince,
or potentate on earth had made or could make any law which
would punish that offence at that place; that the United
States had never pretended that a murder within the limits
of a State was an offence against them, and that it was no
more an offence against the United States than it was against
the republic of France or the empire of Germany, contended
that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction, because1st. Whether the act of Congress did or did not embrace
this case, it was a sheer, flat breach of the Constitution; that
the amount, quantity, and extent of the judicial power of
the United States was defined by and limited by the 2d section of Article III of the Constitution, which says:
"1. The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and
equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United
States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their
authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a
party; to controversies between two or more States; between
a State and citizens of another State; between citizens of different States; between citizens of the same State claiminglands
under grants of different States, and between a State, or the
citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects."
Thus far the power went and no farther. By no construetion-not even the loosest-could it be extended to the punishment of offences against the State. Yet this act gave exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal courts and a total denial
of all right on the part of the State to interfere in any case
that affects a negro; which a case no doubt does where a
negro is a party. Such a condition of things could not be
tolerated by any State, even if it extended to great cases.
But the act extended the jurisdiction of the Federal courts
exclusively of that of the State to all cases affecting negroes;

i. e., to all cases where negroes are parties. It extended it
to the smallest and lowest case, to assaults and batteries, to
small thefts, to the slightest breaches of police regulations;
and, if a negro robbed a hen-roost, the suffering party was
now obliged either to let him go unpunished or to take him
for justice to wherever the Federal court sat, often hundreds
of miles off. The consequence was that nine-tenths of the
lower class of crimes committed by negroes went now unpunished in Kentucky. The act of Congress had, in cases
where it did apply, dislocated all the machinery of the State
courts and rendered them powerless to perform their duty.
But the learned counsel contended,
2d. That there was no jurisdiction because, whether the
enactment was constitutional and valid, or unconstitutional
and void, this case was not within it. This case did not affect
negroes. It was a proceeding by the State against white
men. The United States v. Ortega,* which arose on the abovequoted clause of the Constitution which gives the Federal
courts jurisdiction in "cases affecting ambassadors," decided
that a criminal case affects nobody but the party accused and
the public.
If the act of Congress be constitutional, and if in such a
case as the present negroes are affected by it-that is to say,
when the persons prosecuted are white men and only the witnesses are negroes-any man that pleases may set out with
a pre-expressed determination and commit any crime that
he pleases against the State of Kentucky, and he will do it
with impunity if he will only take a negro along with him
when he does the deed; or, if he is not so happy as to have
done it in the presence of one of that race, if he will hunt
up a black man and make a confession in his presence afterwards. It matters not whether the testimony of the black
witness be important or not so. The same fact may be testified to by twenty white men, but if there be one negro,
that is sufficient (according to the theory of the court below)
to oust the State jurisdiction and vest it exclusively in the

Argument in favor of the jurisdiction.

Federal courts. If a fight take place between white men
at a barbecue, or militia muster, or cross-roads meetingthough it concern nobody but white men-they cannot be
indicted for the offence in any court of Kentucky if one
single negro in the whole crowd saw the thing done; and
if actually so indicted, white men, in order to be acquitted,
need only prove themselves guilty and that their crime was
committed in the presence of a negro! To such results
does the view of the court below, that a case between the
State and white men "affects" negroes, if any negro is a
witness, necessarily lead. The opposite view is demonstrated
to be a true one by such a reductio ad absurdum.
Mr. B. H. Bristow, Solicitor-General,contra:
1. The thirteenth amendment to the Constitution worked
a radical change in the existence of the United States. But
it did not execute and was not meant to execute itself. Appropriate Congressional legislation was provided for. Most
of the members of the Congress who passed the civil rights
bill were members of the Congress which framed the thirteenth amendment. This fact adds to the probability of
conformity to the purpose of the amendment, independently
of which special argument presumptions are always in favor
of the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Indeed, till
the beginning of the rebellion, this court rarely decided one
unconstitutional. The cases of Marbury v. Olladison* and perhaps Scott v. Sandford,t are the only ones we recall. If the
thirteenth amendment be liberally construed the act of Congress is legislation quite appropriate. The amendment as a
remedial one must be so construed. The obvious intention
was to remove an existing evil, which was recognized as the
cause of the civil strife in which the country was engaged,
and to confer freedom upon the slave as a reward for his
military service in the preservation of the government. It
is unreasonable to suppose that the framers of this amendment, with this end in view, should have been content to

give to these slaves only that small portion of freedom which
the so-called free blacks had theretofore enjoyed. In this
age no man can be called free who is denied the right to
make contracts, sue and be sued, and to give evidence in
the courts. No man is really free who is not protected, by
law, from injury. So long as he is denied the right to testify
against those who violate his person or his property he has
no protection, and is denied the power to defend his own
freedom.
The condition of things in Kentucky und'er its law excluding the evidence of blacks where white persons have
committed crime is disgraceful to a Christian community.
A band of whites shall set upon and murder half a congregation of blacks, their minister included, and though a hundred blacks who saw the massacre survive, and can identify
the murderers, conviction is impossible. The wisdom and
appropriateness of the legislation of Congress, as shown by
the act now in question, cannot be better illustrated than by
the facts of this case. At night, in their own humble cabin,
an unoffending and defenceless old colored man, his infirm
mother more than ninety years of age, his wife, and son, are
murdered in a most shocking manner by two brutal white
men, actuated by no other motive than that of avowed hostility to the black race. The son lingers long enough to tell
the facts of this horrible transaction, and a little sister, twelve
or thirteen years of age, survives the cruel wounds inflicted
upon her at the same time. The dying declarations of the
one and the parol testimony of the other in court, taken in
connection with circumstantial evidence produced at the
trial, establish the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable
doubt. And yet under the law of the State the accused cannot be punished, because in Kentucky black men cannot
give evidence of the crimes of white ones.
2. The case is embraced by the act. The murder did
affect persons who were denied in the State courts rights
which the act of Congress secured. It affected the murdered
negro, the negro witnesses in the case, and the whole negro
population of Kentucky. The United States v. Ortega does

Opinion of the court.

not apply. That case arose on a clause of the Constitution
which gives the Federal court jurisdiction in all "cases" of
a particular sort. The act now under consideration employs
the phrase "causes, civil and criminal." This is broader
language, and, taken in connection with the title and subsequent sections of the act, must be understood in the sense
of causes of civil action and causes of criminal prosecution. It
cannot be said that in no case is any one affected by a cause
who is not a party to the legal proceeding growing out of
such cause. This was the view maintained on the Circuit,
after great consideration, by Swayne, J., in United States v.
Rhodes,* which arose on this act of Congress, and where the
same arguments were used against the jurisdiction as here.
[Some discussion, not material to be reported, was also
had at the bar by the counsel on both sides, as to whether
the case was properly brought here by writ of error;and also
as to the respective jurisdictions of the District and Circuit
Courts under the 2d and 3d sections of the act.]
Mr. Justice STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.
Addressing ourselves to the first of the questions presented by the record-the question of jurisdiction-it may
be remarked that clearly the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of the crime of murder committed within the district
of Kentucky, unless it was conferred by the third section of
the act of Congress of April 9th, 1866.
It must be admitted that the crimes and offences of which
the District Courts are, by this section, given exclusive jurisdiction, are only those which are against the provisions of
the act, or those enumerated in the second and sixth sections,
and that the "causes, civil and criminal," over which jurisdiction is, by the second clause of the section, conferred
upon the District and Circuit Courts of the United States
concurrently, are other than those of which exclusive jurisdiction is given to the District Courts. They are described
* 1 Abbott's United States, 29.

BLYEW V. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the court.

as causes "affecting persons who are denied, or cannot enforce in the courts or judicial tribunals of the State, or
locality, where they may be, any of the rights secured to
them by the first section of the act."
Was, then, the prosecution, or indictment, against, these
defendants a cause affecting any such person or persons ? If
it was, then by the provisions of the act it was within the
jurisdiction of the court, and if it was not, that iourt had
no jurisdiction.
It was, the record shows, an indictment for the murder of
Lucy Armstrong, a citizen of the United States of the African race, and it contained an averment that other citizens
of the United States of the same race, witnessed the alleged
murder. It contained also an averment that those other
persons, namely, Richard Foster and Laura Foster, as well
as the deceased Lucy Armstrong, were, on account of their
race and color, denied the right to testify against the defendants, or either of them, of and concerning the killing and
murder, in the courts and judicial tribunals of the State of
Kentucky.
We are thus brought to the question whether a criminal
prosecution for a public offence is a cause "affecting," within
the meaning of the act of Congress, persons who may be
called to testify therein. Obviously the only parties to such
a cause are the government and the persons indicted. They
alone can be reached by any judgment that may be pronounced. No judgment can either enlarge or diminish the
personal, relative, or property rights of any others than
those who are parties. It is true there are some cases which
may affect the rights of property of persons who are not
parties to the record. Such cases, however, are all of a civil
nature, and none of them even touch rights of person. But
an indictment prosecuted by the government against an alleged criminal, is a cause in which none but the parties can
have any concern, except what is common to all the members of the community. Those who may possibly be witnesses, either for the prosecution or for the defence, are no
more affected by it than is every other person, for any one

BLYEW V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

may be called as a witness. It will not be thought that
Congress intended to give to the District and Circuit Courts
jurisdiction over all causes both civil and criminal. They
have expressly confined it to causes affecting certain persons.
And yet, if all those who may be called as witnesses in a
case, and who may be alleged to be important witnesses,
were intended to be described in the class of persons affected
by it, and if the jurisdiction of the Federal courts can be
invoked by the assertion that there are persons who may be
witnesses, but Wvho, because of their race or color, are incompetent to testify in the courts of the State, there is no
cause either civil or criminal of which those courts may not
at the option of either party take jurisdiction. The statute
of Kentucky which was in existence when this indictment
was found, and which denied the right of Richard Foster
and Laura Foster to testify in the courts of the State, enacted as follows: "that a slave, negro, or Indian shall be a
competent witness in the case of the commonwealth for or
against a slave, negro, or Indian, or in a civil case to which
only negroes or Indians are parties, but in no other case."
It will be observed that this statute prohibits the testimony
of colored persons either for or against a white person in
any civil or criminal cause to which he may be a party. If,
therefore, they are persons affected by the cause, whenever
they might be witnesses were they competent to testify, it
follows that in any suit between white citizens, jurisdiction
might be taken by the Federal courts whenever it was alleged that a citizen of the African race was or might be an
important witness. And such an allegation might always
be made. So in all criminal prosecutions against white persons a similar allegation would call into existence the like
jurisdiction. We cannot think that such was the purpose
of Congress in the statute of April 9th, 1866. It would seem
rather to have been to affbrd protection to persons of the
colored race by giving to the Federal courts jurisdiction of
cases, the decision of which might injuriously affect them
either in their personal, relative, or praperty rights, whenever they are denied in the State courts any of the rights

Opinion of the court.

mentioned and assured to them in the first section of the
act.
1Nor can it be said that such a construction allows little or
no effect to the enactment. On the contrary, it concedes to
it a far-reaching purpose. That purpose was to guard all
the declared rights of colored persons, in all civil actions to
which they may be parties in interest, by giving to the District and Circuit Courts of the United States jurisdiction of
such actions whenever in the State courts any right enjoyed
by white citizens is denied them. And in criminal prosecutions against them, it extends a like protection. We cannot
be expected to be ignorant of the condition of things which
existed when the statute was enacted, or of the evils which
it was intended to remedy. It is well known that in many
of the States, laws existed which subjected colored men convicted of criminal offences to punishments different from
and often severer than those which were inflicted upon white
persdns convicted of similar offences. The modes of trial
were also different, and the right of trial by jury was sometimes denied them. It is also well known that in many
quarters prejudices existed against the colored race, which
naturally affected the administration of justice in the State
courts, and operated harshly when one of that race was a
party accused. These were evils doubtless which the act
of Congress had in view, and which it intended to remove.
And so far as it reaches, it extends to both races the same
rights, and the same means of vindicating them.
In view of these considerations we are of opinion that the
case now before us is not within the provisions of the act of
April 9th, 1866, and that the Circuit Court had not jurisdiction of the crime of murder committed in the district of
Kentucky, merely because two persons who witnessed the
murder were citizens of the African race, and for that reason
incompetent by the law of Kentucky to testify in the courts
of that State. They are not persons affected by the cause.
We need hardly add that the jurisdiction of the Circuit
Court is not sustained by the fact averred in the indictment
that Lucy Armstrong, the person murdered, was a citizen of
88

Opinion of the court.

the African race, and for that reason denied the right to
testify in the Kentucky courts. In no sense can she be said
to be affected by the cause. Manifestly the act refers to
persons in existence. She was the victim of the frightful
outrage which gave rise to the cause, but she is beyond being
affected by the cause itself.
The conclusions to which we have come are sustained, we
think, fully by the judgment of this court in United States v.
Ortega,* in which the opinion was delivered by [r. Justice
Washington. It was the case of an indictment in the Circuit Court for offering violence to the person of the Spanish
minister, contrary to the law of nations and the act of Congress. The second section of the third article of the Constitution ordains that the judicial power of the United States
shall extend to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public
ministers and consuls, and that in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, the Supreme
Court shall have original jurisdiction. The defendant was
convicted, and on motion in arrest of judgment, the question
was presented to this court (and it was the only one decided),
whether it was a case affecting an ambassador, or other
public minister. The court unanimously ruled that it was
not. The violence out of which the indictment grew was
committed upon a public minister, and he was a competent
and material witness. But he was ruled to be not a person
affected by the case, because it was a public prosecution instituted and conducted by and in the name of the United
States, and for the purpose of vindicating the laws of nations
and that of the United States, in the person of a public
minister, offended by an assault committed on him by a private individual. It is, said the court, a case then, which
affects the United States and the individual whom they seek
to punish; but one in which the minister himself, although
he was the person injured by the assault, has no concern,
either in the event of the prosecution, or in the costs attending it. What was meant by the phrase "a case affecting,"

was thus early defined, and we are bound to presume that
Congress, when they used the same word "affecting" in the
act of 1866, intended to have it bear its defined meaning.
This is according to a well-known rule of construction.
An attempt has, however, been made to discriminate between the words "case affecting," as found in the constitutional provision, and the words "cause affecting," contained
in the act of Congress. We are unable to perceive any substantial ground for a distinction. The words "case" and
"cause" are constantly used as synonyms in statutes and
judicial decisions, each meaning.a proceeding in court, a
suit, or action. Surely no court can have jurisdiction of
either a case or a cause until it is presented in the form of
an action. We regard, therefore, The United States v. Ortega
as an authority directly in point to the effect that witnesses
in a criminal prosecution are not persons affected by the
cause.

It necessarily results from this that jurisdiction of

the offence for which these defendants were indicted, was
not conferred upon the Circuit Court by the act of Congress.
It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider the other questions presented by the record.
JUDGMENT REVERSED.

The CHIEF JTUSTICE was not present at the argument,
and took no part in the judgment.
Mr. Justice BRADLEY, with whom concurred. Mr. Justice SWAYNE, dissenting.
I dissent from the opinion of the court in this case for the
following reasons:
The civil rights bill (passed April 9th, 1866, and under
which the indictment in this case was found and prosecuted)
was primarily intended to carry out, 'in all its length and
breadth, and to all its legitimate consequences, the then
recent constitutional amendment abolishing slavery in the
United States, and to place persons of African descent on an
equality of rights and privileges with other citizens of the
United States. To do this effectually it was not only neces-

sary to declare this equality and impose penalties for its violation, but, as far as practicable, to counteract those unjust
and discriminating laws of some of the States by which persons of African descent were subjected to punishments of
peculiar harshness and ignominy, and deprived of rights and
privileges enjoyed by white citizens.
This general scope and object of the act will often furnish
us a clue to its just construction. It may be remarked, however, that the terms of the act are broad enough to embrace
other persons as well as those of African descent, but that is
a point not now in question in this case.
The first section declares that all persons born in the
United States, not subject to a foreign power, and not including untaxed Indians, are citizens of the United States,
and that such citizens, of every race and color, without regard to previous condition of slavery, shall have the same
right, in every State and Territory in the United States, to
make and enforce contracts; to sue, be parties, and give
evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey
real and personal property, and to the full and equal benefit
of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and
property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none
other, any law or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.
This is the fundamental section of the act. All that follows is intended to secure and vindicate, to the objects of it,
the rights herein declared, and to establish the requisite machinery for that end.
This section is in direct conflict with those State laws
which forbade a free colored person to remove to or pass
through the State, from having firearms, from exercising the
functions of a minister of the gospel, and from keeping a
house of entertainment; laws which prohibited all colored
persons from being taught to read and write, from holding
or conveying property, and from being witnesses in any case
where a white person was concerned; and laws which subjected them to cruel and ignominious punishments not imposed upon white persons, such as to be sold as vagrants, to

be tied to the whipping-post, &c., &c. All these, and all
other discriminations, were intended to be, abolished and
done away with.
The second section makes it a misdemeanor, punishable
by fine or imprisonment, for any person, under color of any
law or custom, to deprive any inhabitant ofa State or Territory of any right secured by the act, or to subject him to
different punishment or penalties on account of his having
been a slave, or by reason of his color or race, than is prescribed for the punishment of white persons.
The third section proceeds to confer upon the District
Courts of the United States, exclusive of the State courts,
jurisdiction to try these offences, and then follows the clause
under which the indictment in the present case was found,
declaring that the said District Courts shall also have cognizance, concurrently with the Circuit Courts of the United
States, "of all causes, civil and criminal, affecting persons
who are denied, or cannot enforce in the courts or judicial
tribunals of the State, or locality where they may be, any of
the rights secured to them by the first section," with right
of removal of causes from State courts, &c. It is evident
that the provisions of the second section, maling it a criminal offence to deprive a person of his rights, or to subject
him to a discriminating punishment, would fail to reach a
great number of cases which the broad and liberal provisions
of the first section were intended to cover and protect. The
clause in question is intended to reach these cases, or, at
least, a large class of them. It provides a remedy where
the State refuses to give one; where the mischief consists in
inaction or refusal to act, or refusal to give requisite relief;
whereas the second section provides for actual, positive invasion of rights. Thus, if the State should refuse to allow a
freedman to sue in its courts, thereby denying him judicial
relief, or should fail to provide laws for the punishment of
white persons guilty of criminal acts against his person or
property, thereby denying him judicial redress, there can be
no doubt that the case would come within the scope of the
clause under consideration. Suppose that, in any State,

assault and battery, mayhem-nay, murder itself, could be
perpetrated upon a colored man with impunity, no law being
provided for punishing the offender, would not that be a
case of denial of rights to the colored population of that
State? Would not the clause of the civil rights bill now
under consideration give jurisdiction to the United States
courts in such a case? Yet, if an indictment should be
found in one of those courts against the offender, the technical parties to the record would only be the United States
as plaintiff and the criminal as defendant. Nevertheless
could it be said, with any truth or justice, that this would
not be a cause affecting persons denied the rights secured to
them by the first section of the law?
The case before us is just as clearly within the scope of
the law as such a case would be. I do not put it upon the
ground that the witnesses of the murder, or some of them,
are colored persons, disqualified by the laws of Kentucky to
testify, but on the ground that the cause is one afibecting the
person murdered, as well as the whole class of persons to
which she belonged. Had the case been simple assault and
battery, the injured party would have been deprived of a
right, enjoyed by every white citizen, of entering a complaint before a magistrate, or the grand jury, and of appearing as a witness on the trial of the offender. I say " right,"
for it is a right, an inestimable right, that of invoking the
penalties of the law upon those who criminally or feloniously
attack our persons or our property. Civil society has deprived us of the natural right of avenging ourselves, but it
has preserved to us, all the more jealously, the right of
bringing the offender to justice. By the common law of
England the injured party was the actual prosecutor of
criminal offences, although the proceeding was in the king's
name; but in felonies, which involved a forfeiture to the
crown of the criminal's property, it was also the duty of the
crown officers to superintend the prosecution. And, although
in this country it is almost the universal practice to appoint
public and official prosecutors in criminal cases, yet it is the
right of the injured party, and a duty he owes to society, to

furnish what aid he can in bringing the offender to justice;
and an important part of that right and duty consists in
giving evidence against him.
To deprive a whole class of the community of this right,
to refuse their evidence and their sworn complaints, is to
brand them with a badge of slavery; is to expose them to
wanton insults and fiendish assaults; is to leave their lives,
their families, and their property unprotected by law. It
gives unrestricted license and impunity to vindictive outlaws
and felons to rush upon these helpless people and kill and
slay them at will, as was done in this case. To say that actions or prosecutions intended for the redress of such outrages are not "causes affecting the persons" who are the
victims of them, is to take, it seems to me, a view of the law
too narrow, too technical, and too forgetful of the liberal objects it had in view. If, in such a raid as I have supposed,
a colored person is merely wounded or maimed, but is still
capable of making complaint, and on appearing to do so,
has the doors of justice shut in his face on the ground that
he is a colored person, and cannot testify against a white
citizen, it seems to me almost a stultification of the law to
say that the case is not within its scope. Let us read it once
more: "The District Courts shall, concurrently with the
Circuit Courts, have cognizance of all causes, civil and criminal, affecting persons who are denied -or cannot enforce in
the courts or judicial tribunals of the State or locality where
they may be, any of the rights secured to them by the first
section of this act."
If the case above supposed is within the act (as it assuredly
must be), does it cease to be so when the violence offered is
so great as to deprive the victim of life? Such a construction would be a premium on murder. If mere violence
offered to a colored person (who, by the law of Kentucky,
was denied the privilege of complaint), gives the United
,States court jurisdiction, when such'violence is short of being
fatal, that jurisdiction cannot cease when death is the result.
The reason for its existence is stronger than before. If it
would have been a cause affecting him when 'living, it will

be a cause affecting him though dead. The object of prosecution and punishment is to prevent crime, as well as to vindicate public justice. The fear of it, the anticipation of it,
stands between the assassin and his victim like a vindictive
shade. It arrests his arm, and loosens the dagger from his
grasp. Should not the colored man have the vegis of this
protection to guard his life, as well as to guard his limbs, or
his property? Should he not enjoy it in equal degree with
the white citizen ? In a large and just sense, can a prosecution for his murder affect him any less than a prosecution
for an assault upon him? He is interested in both alike.
They are his protectionagainstviolence and wrong. At all events
it cannot be denied that the entire class of persons under
disability is affected by prosecutions for wrongs done to one
of their number, in which they are not permitted to testify
in the State courts.
I am well aware of the case of Ortega, who was indicted
in the Circuit Court for offering violence to the person of
the Spanish minister. The defendant claimed that it was
"a case affecting a public minister," and under the Constitution cognizable only in the Supreme Court. But the court,
taking the strict and technical view, decided that, being a
criminal case, in which the United States was plaintiff and
the offender was defendant, they only were the parties whom
the case affected. Conceding that this decision was good law
for the purposes of that case, I do not feel that I am bound
by it in this. The effect of that decision was, that the Constitution in giving the Supreme Court jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, only
intended to give these public persons the right to sue and be
sied in the Supreme Court. In the case before us, I think
Congress meant a great deal more than this when it gave the
United States courts cognizance of all causes, civil and criminal, affecting persons who are denied or cannot enforce in the
courts of the State any of the rights secured by the first
section of the act.
I have considered the case irrespective of the fact that the
,witnesses of the transaction were all colored people who, at

the time this indictment was found, were denied the right to
testify against white persons in Kentucky. I have placed it
on the sole ground, that prosecutions for crimes committed
against colored persons, are causes which, in the sense of
the civil rights bill, most seriously affect them; and that in
Kentucky they were denied the privilege of being witnesses
in these causes. I do not mean to be understood as saying
that every cause in which a colored person may be called as
a witness, for that reason belongs to the cognizance of the
United States courts. In ordinary cases of a civil character,
the party calling such a person as a witness is the person

affected. Such party, be he black or white, may except to
the rejection of his witness, and bring the case to this court
by writ of error from the State court of last resort under the
25th section of the Judiciary Act. A defendant in a criminal prosecution may do the same thing where a bill of exceptions is allowed in criminal cases.

To conclude, I have no doubt of the power of Congress
to pass the law now under consideration. Slavery, when it
existed, extended its influence in every direction, depressing
and disfranchising the slave and his race in every possible
way. Hence, in order to give full effect to the National will
in abolishing slavery, it was necessary in some way to counteract these various disabilities and the effects flowing from
them. Merely striking off the fetters of the slave, without
removing the incidents and consequences of slavery, would
hardly have been a boon to the colored race. Hence, also,
the amendment abolishing slavery was supplemented by a
clause giving Congress power to enforce it by appropriate
legislatioa. No law was necessary to abolish slavery; the
amendment did that. The power to enforce the amendment
by appropriate legislation must be a power to do away with
the incidents and consequences of slavery, and to instate the
freedmen in the full enjoyment of that civil liberty and
equality which the abolition of slavery meant.
In my opinion the judgment of the Circuit Court should
be affirmed.
