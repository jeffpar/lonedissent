Deduct from the loading the amount of the coal used as dunnage, and it is conceded that the loading of the ship did not
exceed her registered tonnage, and the jury have found that
the excess beyond her registered tonnage was used as dunnage, and I have no doubt it was properly so used.
Beyond doubt the ship-owner in ballasting his chartered
vessel may take freight-paying merchandise for that purpose,
provided the merchandise occupies no more space than the
ballast would have done if ordinary ballast had been used
instead of merchandise paying freight, and I am of the
opinion that the same rule should be applied in respect to
the dunnage used in stowing the cargo.* Such was also the
opinion of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in a suit between these same parties which arose out of an insurance on
the same voyage.t
Much discussion of the question is unnecessary, as the
views which I entertain and the authorities to support them
are very fully given in that opinion and in the opinion of the
district judge, in which I also concur.

1. When in courts of concurrent jurisdiction, the pendency of a suit in one
is relied on to defeat a second suit in the other, the identity of the parties, of the case made, and of the relief sought, should be such that if
the first suit had been decided it could be pleaded in bar as a former adjudication.
2. In such cases, the proceedings in an appellate court are part of the proceedings in the first court, and orders made by it to be enforced by the
court of primary jurisdiction are, while unexecuted, a part of the case
in the first suit, which may be relied on as lis pendeos in reference to
the second suit.
3. Hence an unexecuted order of this kind, made by a State court to restore
possession to the parties who had been deprived of it by a decree which
had been reversed, cannot be interfered with by another court by way
of injunction, especially by a court of the United States, by reason of
the act of Congress of March 2A, 1793. (1 Stat. at Large, 334, 5.)

4. But the nature and character of the possession so decreed to be delivered
may be inquired, into by another court, and if it was of a fiduciary character, and the trust was not involved in the first suit, a second suit may
be sustained in any court of competent jurisdiction, to declare, define,
and protect the trust, though the first suit may be still pending.
5. Controversies in the civil courts concerning property rights of religious
societies are generally to be decided by a reference to one or more of
three propositions:
(1st.) Was the property or fund which is in question, devoted by the
express terms of the gift, grant, or sale by which it was acquired, to the
support of any specific religious doctrine or belief, or was it acquired
for the general use of the society for religious purposes, with no other
limitation ?
(2d.) Is the society which owned it of the strictly congregational or
independent form of church government, owing no submission to any
organization outside the congregation ?
(3d.) Or is it one of a number of such societies, united to form a more
general body of churches, with ecclesiastical control in the general association over the members and societies of which it is composed?
6. In the first class of cases the court will, when necessary to protect the
trust to which the property has been devoted, inquire into the religious
faith or practice of the parties claiming its use or control, and will see
that it shall not be diverted from that trust.
7. If the property was acquired in the ordinary way of purchase or gift, for
the use of a religious society, the court will inquire who constitute that
society, or its legitimate successors, and award to them the use of the
property.
8. In case of the independent order of the congregation, this is to be determined by the majority of the society, or by such organization of the
society, as by its own rules constitute its government.
9. In the class of cases in which property has been acquired in the same
way by a society which constitutes a subordinate part of a general religious organization with established tribunals for ecclesiastical government, these tribunals must decide all questions of faith, discipline, rule,
custom, or ecclesiastical government.
10. In such cases where the right of property in the civil court is dependent
on the question of doctrine, discipline, ecclesiastical law, rule, or custot, or church government, and that has been decided by the highest
tribunal within the organization to which it has been carried, the civil
court will accept that decision as conclusive, and be governed by it in
its application to the case before it.
11. The principles which induced a different rule in the English courts, examined and rejected as inapplicable to the relations of church and state
in this country, and an examination of the American cases found to sustain the principle above stated.

Statement of the case.

This was a litigation which grew out of certain disturbances in what is known as the "Third or Walnut Street
Presbyterian Church," of Louisville, Kentucky, and which
resulted in a division of its members into two distinct bodies,
each claiming the exclusive use of the property held and
owned by that local church. The case was thus:
The Presbyterian Church in the United States is a voluntary religious organization, which has been in existence for
more than tbree-quarters of a century. It has a written
Confession of Faith, Form of Government, Book of Discipline, and Directory for Worship. The government of the
church is exercised by and through an ascending series of
"judicatories," known as Church Sessions, Presbyteries,
Synods, and a General Assembly
The Church Session, consisting of the pastor and ruling
elders of a particular congregation, is charged with maintaining the spiritual government of the congregation, for
which purpose they have various powers, among which is
tl~e power to receive members into the church, and to concert the best measures for promoting the spiritual interests
of the congregation.* This body, which thus controls in
each local church, is composed of the pastor and ruling
elders. The number of elders is variable, and a majority
of the Session governs. It acts, however, but as representing the congregation which elects it. The elders, so far as
the church edifice is concerned, have no power to dispose of
its use except as members of the Session.
Connected with each local church, and apparently without
any functions in essence ecclesiastical, are what are called
the "Trustees;" three persons usually, in whom is vested
for form's sake, the legal title to the church edifice and other
property; the equitable power of management of the property being with the Session. These Trustees are usually
elected biennially; they are subject to the Session, and may
be removed by the congregation.

manners, and the promotion of charity, truth, and holiness
through all the churches under their care."*
The Walnut Street Presbyterian Church, of which we
have spoken, was organized about 1842, under the authority
and as a part of the Presbyterian Church in the United
States, and, with the assent of all its members, was received
into connection with and under the jurisdiction of the Presbytery of Louisville and the Synod of Kentucky. It remained in such connection and under such jurisdiction,
without any disturbance among its members, until the year
1865, when certain events took place in Kentucky which
will be stated presently.
After the organization, to wit, in 1853, the said local
church purchased a lot of ground in Louisville, and a conveyance was made to the church's trustees to have and to
hold to them, and to their successors, to be chosen by the
congregation.
In 1854 the trustees of the church were incorporated with
power to hold any real estate then owned by it; the property
to pass to them and their successors in office. By the act it
was declared that the trustees, to be elected by the members of the congregation, should continue in office two years,
and until their successors were elected, "unless they shall
sooner resign, or refuse to act, or cease to be members of
the said church." The trustees were charged by the act
with the duty of providing for the comfort and convenience
of the congregation, the preservation of the property, and
passing such regulations relative to the government and
control of the church property as they might think proper,
not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States
and the laws of Kentucky.
Though neither the deed nor charter said this in terms, it
was admitted that both contemplated the connection of the
local church with the general Presbyterian one, and subjected both property and trustees alike to the operation of
its fundamental laws.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

We now pass to some history of the disturbances to which
we have referred as matter to be related.
With the outbreak of the war of the insurrection, and the
action of it upon the subject of slavery, a very excited condition of things, originating with and influenced by that
subject, manifested itself in the Walnut Street Church. One
of the earliest exhibitions of the matter was in reference to
the re-engagement as minister of a certain Reverend Mr.
McElroy. The members of the church were asked by a
majority of the Session, at this time composed of three persons, named iatson, Gall, and Avery,* to make a call upon
irh. McElroy to become the pastor, but at a congregational
meeting the majority of the members declined to make the
call. The majority of the Session (that is to say, W~alson and
Gall) renewed, notwithstanding, the engagement of Mr. Mc-Elroy for six months. In August, 1865, the majority of the
congregation asked the Session that on the expiration of the
then current six months of Mr. McElroy's engagement no
further renewal thereof should be made. In connection with
these efforts of the majority of the Session ( Watson and Gall)
to maiiftain Mr. Mc.Elroy as preacher, charges were preferred
against three members of the congregation, named B. F.
Avery, T. J. Hackney, and D. McNaughtan, who had cooperated with the majority of it in the movements to obtain
another minister. And about the same time, by way of
counteraction, apparently, charges were preferred by some
of the majority against Valson and Gall. While these
troubles were existing, some of the members of the church
appealed to the Synod of Kentucky, which body, on the
20th of October, 1865, appointed a committee to visit the
congregation, "with power to call a congregational meeting
for the purpose of electing additionalruling elders, calling a

pastor, or choosing a stated supply, and doing any other
business competent to a congregational meeting that may
appear to them, the said congregation, necessary for their
best interests." The synodical committee thus appointed
called a congregational meeting for the purpose of the election, in January, 1866. Watson and Gall refused to open
the church for the meeting, but the majority organizing
themselves on the sidewalk, elected a certain J. A. Leach,
with B. F. Avery and D. Mc"aughtan (which last two names
have already appeared in our history), additional ruling
elders, who went through what they deemed a valid process
of ordination and instalment. The other admitted elders
were Watson, Galt, and Hackney. The trustees of the church
were .enry Farley, George Fulton, and B. F. Avery, and they
had the actual possession of the church property. Fulton
and Parley, uniting with Watson and Gall, denied the validity of the election of Avery, Leach, and McNaughtan, and
refused to allow them any participation as elders in the coutrol of the church property. Hackney admitted the validity
of such election, and recognized Avery, Leach, and McKaughtan as lawful elders.
In this state of things, Avery and his associates filed a bill,
on the 1st of February, 1866, in the Louisville Chancery
Court, against Watson, Gall, Palton, and Farley, for the purpose of asserting the right of Avery, Leach, and McNaughtan, as elders, to participate with the other elders in the management of the church property for purposes of religious
worship.
In the progress of that case the three trustees, Farley,
Pulton, and Avery, were appointed, on the 20th of March,
1866, receivers "to take charge of the church building, and
all property belonging to the said church," during the pendency of the suit, or until the further order of the 6ourt;
and they were "ordered to keep and preserve the said property, and keep it in repair to the best of their ability, and to
open the various portions of the building ready for worship,
and other services of said church, according to the laws and
usages of the Presbyterian Church; and not to prevent any

part of the congregation from attendance upon the meetings
of said church, and enjoying the use thereof according to
their rights and privileges as members thereof."
At a subsequent date-June 15th, 1866-the chancellor
delivered an opinion recognizing Avery, Leach, and McNaughtan as elders, and entered an order that the trustees,
Farley, .Fulton,and Avery, now receivers, open the church
for divine worship and congregational meetings whenever
ordered to do so by the Session of the church, constituted
of the said Avery, Hackney, and McNaughtan, Leach, Watson, and Galt, or a majority thereof.
The execution of this order was, apparently, so far interfered with by Watson, Galt, Fulton, and Farley as practically
to prevent religious services in the church edifice. At all
events, on the 23d of July, 1866, it was ordered:
"That the 'MARSHAL OF THIS COURT do take possession of the
church property until the further order of the court, and that
the same be opened: 1. For Sunday-schools and other like purposes. 2. For the meeting of the Session when notified thereof.
3. For public worship, and such using of the pulpit and the
house generally as the Session shall order. And it is o(rdered
that he be respectful to the order of the Session, as this court
said on the 15th of June. The Session, according to the decision
of the General Assembly, at Peoria, Illinois, has control of the
church buildings, &c. The keys of the church, &c., are ordered
to be delivered to the marshal."
The marshal took possession by virtue of this order.
Thenceforward Watson, Galt, Fulton, and Parley abandoned
connection with the property and participation in its control.
Thus matters stood, so far as the church property was
concerned, up to the final decree in Avery et al. v. Watson et
al., made May 7th, 1867, when it was decreed that Leach,
Avery, and Mcaughtan, with Iackney, Watson, and Gall,
were ruling elders that constituted the Session of the Walnut Street Church, and the management of the said property
for the purpose of worship and other religious service was
committed to their care, under the regulations of the Presbyterian
Church in the United States of America. and it was ordered

that the defendants, Watson and Gall, pay to the plaintiffs
their costs.
It will be observed that the marshal was not, by the terms
of the decree, directed to give up his possession; nor was
any motion or order afterwards made requiring him to give
up or discharging him as receiver. Nor did he, in fact, so
far as appeared from the record, ever abandon possession, although the property continued, as it had been since July
23d, 1866, subject to the exclusive control of Avery and his
associates.
From this final decree an appeal was taken to the Court
of Appeals of Kentucky, but Watson and his friends did not
supersede that decree, nor take other step to prevent its immediate execution.
The decree of the chancellor was reversed by the Court
of Appeals of Kentucky.* The language of the order of
reversal was thus:
"And the judgment of the chancellor, which commits the management and control of said church property to said Avery, McNaughtan, and Leach, in conjunction with said Watson, Galt,
and Hackney, is therefore deemed erroneous. Wherefore the
judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for proper corrective proceedings respecting the possession, control, and use
of the church property, and for final judgment in conformity to
this opinion."
As to the nature of the issues in this case of Avery v. Watson, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky said :t
"As suggested in the argument, and apparently conceded on
both sides, this is not a case of division or schism in a church, nor
is there any question as to which of TWO BODIES should be recognized
as the Third or Walnut Street Presbyterian Church; nor is there
any controversy as to the authority of Watson and Galt to act
as ruling elders; but the sole inquiry to which we are restricted,
as we conceive, is whether Avery, McNaughtan, and Leach are
ALSO ruling elders, and therefore members of the Session of the
church."

WATSON V. JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

On the 21st of February, 1868, the opinion and mandate
of the Court of Appeals was filed in the Louisville Chancery
Court, and the defendants moved the court "to restore to
them, and those entitled under the said opinion, the possession, use, and control of the church building and property,
which was taken from them by the marshal of the court,
under orders of court, during the pendency of the action,
and to dismiss the plaintiffs' petition with costs."
On the 28th of February, 1868, the complainants in the case
of Avery v. IValson filed a petition in equity against the defendants, and moved the court for an iijunction " enjoining
them from any further prosecution of their said motion
made on the 21st of February, 1868, and from all proceeding by motion, suit, or otherwise to obtain possession, control, or use of the property of the Walnut Street Presbyterian
Church of Louisville."
The petition in equity thus presented averred that subsequent to the original decree of the chancellor, 'Watson, Gall,
and the others adhering to them, had voluntarily withdrawn
from the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church, and from the
Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, and
had thereby ceased to be members of the said church, or to
have any interest in the property held by that church; that
the plaintiffs in that injunction suit, together with those
united in interest with them, constituted at that time the
only beneficiaries of the trust property; and that therefore
the attempt of tVatson and hisfriends, under a mere order of
restitution, based upon the reversal by the appellate court of
the chancellor's decree, to obtain the possession of the property, as elders and trustees, was a fraud upon the rights of the
beneficiaries of the property. And it charged that WI'atson
and his friends intended to use the property as the property
exclusively of their party and to deny the rights of all others
as members.
On the 20th day of March, 1868, the chancellor granted
upon this petition an injunction against the defendants in
the action, enjoining them from any further proceeding on
their motion made on February 21st, 1868; the former de-

cree being at the same time so far reversed that the original
petition was dismissed, and costs awarded to the defendants.
Waitson and his friends now obtained from the Court of
Appeals of Kentucky a summons against the chancellor of
the Louisville Chancery Court "to appear and show cause
why he has refused to carry into effect the mandate of said
court," and the chancellor having appeared, an opinion upon
the rule was delivered.*
In the last-named case it was decided:
1. That the opinion and mandate in the previous decision
.in the appellate court,t imported a direction to restore to
the defendants such rights of possession, control, and use of
the property as the former judgment had erroneously taken
or withheld from them.
2. That "no undecided question was reserved for further
litigation in the court below."
3. That the Chancery Court must enter the proper order
directed by the Court of Appeals; and "if there be any
equitable reason for not coercing the order or decree for
restitution, it should be made available as a ground for enjoining, and not for preventing or modifying, the order -ofrestitution."
4. That the petition in equity of Avery and others, although
intended to operate both as a written defence to the action
of the court sought by the defendants in the old suit, and at
the same time as the initial pleading in a new one, was to
be regarded, so far as the action of the chancellor was concerned, as a response of the plaintiffs, interposed to prevent
the rendering of a judgment in conformity to the decision
and mandate of this court.
5. That if any equitable reasons existed for not enforcing
restitution, they should be asserted in a new suit, enjoining
the enforcement of the order of restitution after such order
had been entered.
Accordingly the Court of Appeals, June 26th, 1868, on this
rule against the chancellor, ordered that the latter make an

order "restoring the possession, use, and control of the
church building and property to the parties entitled thereto
according to the said opinion, and so far as they were deprived
thereof by the marshal of the Chancery Court under its
orders."
The parties in whose favor, according to the opinion, the
order of restitution was to be made were of course Watson,
Gall, and Hackney, ELDERS, and Fulton, Farley, and Avery,
TRUSTEES.

After this last decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals,
the petition for injunction filed in the Louisville Chancery
Court on the 28th of February, 1868, was, on the motion of
those who filed it, dismissed without prejudice.
The present suit in the Circvit Court was begun July 17th, 1868.
Subsequently, on the 18th of September, 1868, the chancellor directed the marshal of the Chancery Court " to restore the possession, use, and control of the church building
and property . . . to Farley, Fulton, and Avery, or a majority of them, as trustees, and to Watson, Galt, and Hackney,
or a nmjority of them, as ruling elders of the said church, and
to report how he had executed the order;" reserving the
case for such further order as might be necessary to enforce
full obedience.
Thus far as to the controversy in the Walnut Street
Church, involved in the particular case of "Watsonv. Avery,
in the State courts of Kentucky.
We have already adverted to the war of the insurrection,
its action on the subject of slavery, and the feeling engendered by this action in the special congregation of the Walnut Street Church.
We now speak of the same subject of the war, of slavery,
&c., in its more general relation with the judicatories above
that local church, and of the way in which this local church
was affected by and identified itself with the action of the
more general church. From the beginning of the war to
its close, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church
at its annual meetings expressed in Declaratory Statements

or Resolutions, its sense of the obligation of all good citizens to support the Federal government in that struggle;
and when, by the proclamation of President Lincoln, emancipation of the slaves of the States in insurrection was
announced, that body also expressed views favorable to
,emancipation, and adverse to the institution of slavery. At
its meeting in Pittsburg in May, 1865, instructions were
given to the Presbyteries, the Board of Missions, and to the
Sessions of the churches, that when any person from the
Southern States should make application for employment
as missionary or fdr admission as members, or ministers of
churches, inquiry should be made as to their sentiments in
regard to loyalty to the government and on the subject of
slavery; and if it was found that they had been guilty of
voluntarily aiding the war of the rebellion* or held the doctrine announced by the large body of the churches in the
insurrectionary States which had organized a new General
Assembly, that "the system of negro slavery in the South
is a divine institution, and that it is the peculiar mission of
the Southern church to conserve that institution," they
should be required to repent and forsake these sins before
they could be received.
In the month of September thereafter the Presbytery of
Louisville, under whose immediate jurisdiction was the
Walnut Street Church, adopted and published in pamphlet
form, what it called "A. Declarationand Testimony against the
erroneous and heretical doctrines and practiceswhich have obtained
and been propagated in the -PresbyterianChurch of the United
States during the lastfive years." This Declaration denounced,
in the severest terms, the action .of the General Assembly
in the matters we have just mentioned, declared an intention to refuse to be governed by that action, and invited the
co-operation of all members of the Presbyterian Church who
shared the sentiments of the Declaration, in a concerted resistance to *,hat they called "the usurpation of authority"
by the Assembly.
The General Assembly of 1866, denounced in turn the
Declaration and Testimony and declared that every Pres-

bytery which refused to obey its order should be ipso facto
dissolved, and called to answer before the next General Assembly; giving the Louisville Presbytery an opportunity
for repentance and conformity. The Louisville Presbytery
divided, and the adherents of the Declaration and Testimony sought and obtained admission, in 1868, into " the
Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States," a body
which had several years previously withdrawn from the
General Assembly of the United States and set up a new
organization.
In January, 1866, the congregation of the Walnut Street
Church became divided in the manner stated above, each
asserting that it constituted the church, although the issue
as to membership was not distinctly made in the chancery
suit of Avery v. Matson already so fully described. Both
parties at this time recognized the same superior church judicatories.
On the 19th June, 1866, the Synod of Kentucky became
divided, the opposing party in each asserting respectively
that it constituted the true Presbytery and the true Synod;
each meanwhile recognizing and professing to adhere to the
same General Assembly. Of these contesting bodies IValson
and his party adhered to one, those whom he opposed to the
other. The Presbytery and Synod to which these last, that
is to say, Avery or Hackney and his party, adhered, being
known respectively as the McMillan Presbytery and the
Lapsley Synod.
On the 1st of June, 1867, the Presbytery and Synod recognized by Watson and his party, were declared by the General
Assembly to be "i n no sense a true and lawful Synod and
Presbytery in connection with and under the care and authority of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church
in the United States of America;" and were permanently
excluded from connection with or representation in the Assembly. By the same resolution the Synod and Presbytery
adhered to by those whom Watson and his party opposed were
declared to be the true and lawful Presbytery of Louisville,
and Synod of Kentucky.

Dec. 1871.]

WATSON V. JONES.
Statement of the case.

The Synod of Kentucky thus excluded, by a resolution
adopted the 28th June, 1867, declared "that in its future
action it will be governed by this recognized sundering of
all its relations to the aforesaid revolutionary body (the
General Assembly) by the acts of that body itself." The
Presbytery took substantially the same action.
In this final severance of Presbytery and Synod from the
General Assembly, Watson and his friends on the one side,
and those whom he opposed on the other, continued to
adhere to those bodies at first recognized by them respectively. This latter party now included, among many others,
at certain William Jones, with his wife, and one Eleanor Lee,
who had been admitted into membership by the Hackney,
&c., Session.
The reader will now readily perceive, if he have not done
so before, how in the earliest stages of this controversy it
was found that a majority of the members of the Walnut
Street Church concurred with the action of the General
Assembly, while Watson and Galt as ruling elders, and Fulton and Farley as trustees, constituting in each case a majority of the Session and of the trustees, with Mr. McElroy
the pastor, sympathized with the party of the .Declaration
and Testimony of the Louisville Presbytery. And how this
led to efforts by each party to exclude the other from participation in the Session of the church and the use of the church
property; as well as to all that followed.
The grounds on which the Court of Appeals reversed
the chancellor's decision were, of course, that the General
Assembly, Synod, and Presbytery of the Presbyterian
Church, were all subject, in the exercise of their functions,
to Constitutions (the standards mentioned at the beginning
of this report); that when they violated these, their acts
were beyond their jurisdiction and void; that whether they
had violated them or not, was a matter which the civil
courts, on an examination of the Constitutions, could properly pass on; and deciding further and finally as fact, after
an examination by the court itself of these standards, that

deliverances enforcing loyalty, they had violated them; and
that their acts were accordingly void.
Thus things stood in July, 1868; and the term for which
the old trustees had, in more peaceful times, been elected
having expired, the persons worshipping in the Walnut
Street Church and so in possession, elected as new ones
three persons whose names now first figure on our report.
These persons were named McDougall, McPherson, and
Ashcraft.
The newly elected elders and the majority of the congregation adhered to and had been recognized by the General
Assembly as the regular and lawful Walnut Street Church
and officers. Galt and Watson, Falton and Farley, and a
minority of the members, had cast their fortunes with those
who adhered to the party of the Declaration and Testimony.
In this state of things, Jones, his wife, and Lee, on the 21st
July, 1868, three nonths before the )mandateof September 181h
to the Chancery Court, mentioned at page 690, filed a bill in
chancery in the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Kentucky against Watson and Galt,* alton, Farley,' and Avery, the church corporation, and McDougall,
McPherson, and Asheraft, as trustees. The complainants
alleged that they were citizens of Indiana; and that each of
the natural persons already named were residents of Louisville and citizens of Kentucky, and that the church corporation was a corporation created by Kentucky and doing business in that State. They alleged further that they were members in good and regular standing of the said church, attending its religious exercises under the pastorship of the Rev. J.
S. Hays, and that the defendants, Pulton and Farley, who pretended without right to be trustees of the church, supported
and recognized as such by the defendants, Watson and Galt,
who also pretended without right to be ruling elders, were
threatening, preparing, and about to take unlawful posses* Watson and Galt, the reader will remember, had been declared by the

sion of the house of worship and grounds belonging to the
church and to prevent Hays, who was the rightful pastor,
from ministering therein, refusing to recognize him as pastor, and to recognize as ruling elder, Hackney, who was the
sole lawful ruling elder; and that when they should obtain
such possession they would oust Hays -and Hackney, and
those who attended their ministrations, among whom the
complainants represented themselves to be.
They further alleged that Hackney., whose duty it was as
elder, and McDougall, McPherson, and Ashcraft, whose
duty it was as trustees to protect the rights thus threatened,
by such a proceeding in the courts as would-prevent the execution of the threats and designs of the other defendants,
refused to take any steps to that end.
They further alleged that the Walnut Street Church, of
which they were members, now formed and had ever since
its organization in the year 1842, formed a part of the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America, known as
the Old School, which was governed by a written constitution that included the Confession of Faith, Form of Government, Book of Discipline, and Directory for Worship.; and
that the governing bodies of the general church above
the Walnut Street Church, were, in successive order, the
Presbytery of Louisville, the Synod of Kentucky, and the
General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the United
States; that while the complainants and abut 115 members who worshipped with them, and Mr. Hays (the pastor),
Hackney (the ruling elder), and McDougall, McPherson,
and Ashcraft (the trustees), were now in full membership
and relation with the lawful General Presbyterian Church
aforesaid, Watson and Galt, Fulton and -Farley, with about
80 persons formerly members of the said church, worshipping under one Dr. Yandell as pastor, had seceded and withdrawn themselves from the Walnut Street Church, and from
the General Presbyterian Church in the United States, and
had voluntarily connected themselves with and were now
members of another religious society, and that they had repudiated and did now repudiate and renounce the authority

and jurisdiction of the various judicatories of the Presbyterian Church of the United States and acknowledge and
recognize the authority of other church judicatories which
were disconnected from the Presbyterian Church of the
United States and from the Walnut Street Church. And
they alleged that Watson and Galt had been, by the order
of the General Assembly of the said church, dropped from
the roll of elders in said church for having so withdrawn
and renounced its jurisdiction, and that the Assembly had
declared'the organization to which the plaintiffs adhered as
the true and only Walnut Street Presbyterian Church of
Louisville.
The prayer of the bill was that " Watson, Galt, Fulton, and
arley be restrained by an injunction issuing out of the Circuit Court, from taking, or attempting to take, possession
of the house of worship and other property of the Walnut
Street Church, and from interfering with REv. J. S. HAYS
PREACHING IN SAID HOUSE OF WORSHIP;

also that Watson and

Galt be restrained in like manner from controlling, or attempting to control or manage, the said property in the
capacity of elders of the church; also, that Fulton and Farley be restrained in like manner from controlling, or attempting to control or manage, the said property as trustees of
said church; . . . and that the complainants have generally
such other and further relief as the nature of their case required."
The answer having alleged that pending the final process in
the Chancery Court two persons, named Heeter and Given,
had been elected additional ruling elders, and that one Polk
had been elected trustee, in the place of Avery, the complainants amended their bill accordingly, and by agreement
the answer of the original defendants was made the answer
of the new parties.
The defendants, Hackney, McDougall, McPherson, and
Asheraft, answered, admitting the allegations of the bill,
and that though requested they had refused to prosecute
legal proceedings in the matter, because as they thought
any effort to that end in the courts of the State of Kentucky
would prove useless.

WATSON V. JONES.
Statement of the case.

The defendants Watson and Galt, Pulton and Parley, answered, and after deciaring their belief that the complainants were lately citizens of Kentucky and that their citizenship in Indiana was merely for the purpose of filing this
bill in the Federal court, denied almost every allegation of
the bill. They set up that though they bad been deprived
of their former actual possession of the church edifice and
property by the illegal and now overruled decree of the
Louisville Chancery Court, they had nevertheless maintained and kept up a regular and valid organization of the
Walnut Street Presbyterian Church-the only regular and
valid organization that had been kept up; that they were
the lawful officers of that church, and that they and those
whom they represented were its true members. They denied
having withdrawn from either the local or the general
church, and denied that the action of the General Assembly
cutting them off was within its constitutional authority.
They represented that the plaintiffs were not and never had
been lawfully admitted to membership in the Walnut Street
Church, and had no such interest in it as would sustain this
suit, and they set up and relied upon the suit in the Chancery
Court of Louisville, which they represented was still pending, and which they stated involved the same subject-matter,
and was between the same parties in interest as the present
one. They alleged that in that suit they had been decreed
to be the only true and lawful trustees and elders of the
Walnut Street Church, and that an order had been made to
place them in possession of the church property, which order remained unexecuted, and that the property was still in
the possession of the marshal of that court as its receiver.
These facts were relied on in bar to the present suit.
The case coming on to be heard, the Circuit Court declared that it seemed to it that the complainants were members of the Third or Walnut Street Presbyterian Church in
Louisville, and as such had a beneficial interest in the church
building and other property in the pleadings mentioned.

respectively entitled to exercise whatever authority in the said
church, or over its members or property, rightfully belonged
to pastor, elders, and trustees, respectively, in churches in
connection with "The Presbyterian Church in the United
States of America," Old School, and according to the regulations and usages of that church.
That McDougall, McPherson, and Ashcraft, trustees, were
in regular succession from the trustees named in the deed
of conveyance of the church property in 1853, and likewise
in regular succession from the trustees named in the act of
incorporation, and that as such trustees they were entitled
to the exclusive control of the church building and other
property of said church for the purposes of worship by the
members of the said church, in accordance with the regulations and usages of the Presbyterian Church in the United
States.
That those only were to be recognized as members of the
Walnut Street Church who adhered to and recognized the
authority of the Presbyterian Church in the United States
of America, and the various church j udicatories which submit to its jurisdiction; and in determining what was the
true Presbytery of Louisville, and true Synod of Kentucky,
having jurisdiction over the said Walnut Street Presbyterian
Church, its officers and members, this court and all other civil
tribunals were concluded by the action of the General Assembly of
said Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.
That those members of the Walnut Street Church who
worshipped statedly at the church edifice [position in the
city of Louisville described], in said city, who had as their
pastor the Reverend J. S. Hays, and who recognized Hackney, Avery, Leach, and McNaughtan as ruling elders, and
McDougall and McPherson as trustees, including all those
connected with them, who had been received into said
church since January 1st, 1866, under Hackney, Avery,
Leach, and McNaughtan as elders, or under the ministration
of Hays as pastor, constituted the Third or Walnut Street
Presbyterian Church in Louisville, and the sole benefici-

aries for whose use the property mentioned in the pleadings
was dedicated.; and that the said persons, together with
their pastor, elders, and trustees, had the exclusiveright to
use the same according to the regulations and usages of the
Presbyterian Church of the United States of America.
It seemed further to the court that the -Rev. Dr. Yandell
was not pastor of the said Third or Walnut Street Presbyterian Church, nor were Gall, Watson, .Teeter, and Given, or
either of them, elders in the said church. And that Pulton,
Parley, and Polk were not trustees.
That all those persons who pretended to be members of
the said church, but who did not recognize Hays as pastor,
or Hackney, Avery, Leach, and McNaughtan as elders, or
McDougall, McPherson, and Asheraft as trustees, and who
recognized Walson, Gall, Given, and Heeler as elders, and
Fulton, parley, and Polk as trustees, and worshipped separately and apart from those hereinbefore declared to be the
sole beneficiaries of said property, and who denied the authority of Hays as pastor, and also the ecclesiastical authority
of the McMillan Presbytery of Louisville, and of the Lapsley Synod of Kentucky, did not have any connection with,
nor were they members of; the Third or Walnut Street Presbyterian Church, for whose use the property in question was
conveyed and dedicated, nor had the said persons, or any of
them, any beneficial interest in it, nor were they entitled to
the use of it in any way whatever as members of the said
church.
It was thereupon decreed:
1st. That the defendants, Heeler, Given, and Polk, be enjoined from taking possession of, and from using or controlling the church edifice and other property of the Walnut
Street Church, except as they, or any one of them, m. y choose
to attend religious worship, or other religious exercises, in
the same manner as other persons not officers or members
of said church.
2d. That the defendants Watson, Gait, Fulton, Heeler, Given,
.Polk, Parley, and all others, be enjoined from so using or
controlling the said church edifice, or other property of the

church, as in any wise to interfere with the ministrations
therein of Hays as pastor, or with the exercise by him and
by HIaclkney, and others, recognized as elders in the said
church by those herein declared to be sole beneficiaries of
said property, of any authority in the said church or over
its property or members which rightfully belongs to the pastors and elders of the churches in connection with and
according to the usages of the Presbyterian Church of the
United States of America.
3d. That the defendants lValson, Galt, Heeter, Gien,
Fulton, Farley, and Polk, and all others, be enjoined from
using or controlling the church edifice and property in any
other manner than as the property exclusively of the persons hereinbefore declared to be the Third or Walnut Street
Presbyterian Church of Louisville, and the sole beneficiaries
ot said property, having Hays as pastor, and recognizing
Hackney, Avery, Leach, and McNaughtan as elders, and
McDougall, McPherson, and Asheraft as trustees. And that
they, and all others, be enjoined from interfering in any
manner with the use of the said property by the members
of the said church hereinbefore declared to be such, and by
such as might be hereafter admitted into said church according to its forms, and who are or might become connected
with and under the care and authority of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of
America, and the several judicatories which submit to the
authority of said Assembly; and from hindering or preventing any one from worshipping in said church, or participating in any of its religious exercises according to the usages
of said church.
From this decree Watson and the other defendants appealed.

hers. By the constitution of the Presbyterian Church the
Session admits to membership. In Avery v. Watson the direct
issue was whether Avery, Leach, and MeNaughtan were
elders; and it was decided that they were not. The body
which, if they had been elders, would have been a Session,
was, from the fact that they were not elders, not a Session.
But the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction, because,
2. The Louisville Chancery Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the property in controversy, and over the present
parties. A series of cases involving the relations of State
and Federal courts, have established this rule, to wit: that
where property has been once lawfully taken possession of
under process of a court, such court has exclusive jurisdiction over the thing, and that this jurisdiction extends to every
question or claim of title, interest or use touching such
property, of whatever nature or origin, or in whose hands
soever it nay subsist. It is not material that such claim be
wholly different from or that it is prior or subsequent in
date, or even paramount to any or all the claims pending
before the court. The jurisdiction is exclusive over the
thing itself, and such claim must be asserted, if at all, in
the court having such possession and jurisdiction. Conceding that the matters alleged in the present bill constitute a
controversy different from and subsequent in date to that
made before the chancellor, yet, so long as the chancellor's
possession or exclusive jurisdiction of the property or thing
in controversy continued, any decree by the Circuit Court touching that property was without authority and void. Any
alleged claims touching that property should have been asserted before the chancellor or their assertion delayed, until
by execution of final process he had voluntarily and com0 ,
pletely yielded up his jurisdiction over it.
In Eagan v. Lucas,* the claim asserted by the claimant in
the Federal court was wholly different from and independent of the controversy pending in the State court. In Peck
v. Jenness,t the case was similar. In Taylor v. Carrylj the

plaintiffs claimed under a maritime lien for seamen's wages.
The claims were not only asserted by strangers, but were
conceded by this court to be paramount to all claims pending before the State court; and yet, in each case, by reason
of the possession of the State court through its officers, it
was declared to have exclusive jurisdiction of the thing,
capable alone of entertaining any question touching its possession, title, or use, and that the process of the Federal
court was void. Freeman v. Howe* is in coincidence with
all these cases.
But independently of this, the delivery to the trustees and
elders of the body of which the Avery or Jones party are
members, of the possession of the church building cannot
be granted in this suit, nor can the other side be enjoined
from taking possession as prayed for in the bill, because the
property is in the actual possession of the marshal of the
Louisville Chancery Court as its receiver, and because there
is an unexecuted decree of that court ordering him to deliver the possession to the defendants.
The marshal did never in form or fact abandon his possession. The only argument could be that his possession
was that of a receiver, and that his appointment was superseded by the final decree. But it is text-book law that a
receiver is never discharged by final decree.t It is unimportant, however, whether the marshal did or did not either
under order of court or otherwise abandon his possession.
The just construction of the rule we conceive to be, that
property once taken possession of by a court, and disposed
of under its order, remains in custody of the law, subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the court (into whose hands soever it may pass), until by the execution of its final decree,
the jurisdiction of the court is completely exhausted.
II. We come then to the great question of the case; one

our law in those voluntary associations sometimes called

ecclesiastical courts, and how far they are independent of
control by the civi,-a question of magnitude every way;
one which determines the relations of the church to the
state in this country, and whether the church in relation to
its civil interests is organized under the authority of law or
above it.
The case shows two contesting organizations, each asserting itself to be the true Walnut Street Church mentioned in
the deed and charter. The question for decision, therefore,
is strictly one of identity and of lawful organic succession.
-A number of cases of church litigation are reported in
Tew York and New England; but they are inapplicable to
the questions arising herein, because in New England the
cases refer to congregational or independent churches, and
in Nhew York to incorporated religious societies, wherein the
whole body of the congregation, whether members of the
church or not, are members of the corporation; and where
disputed questions touching property or other rights are
determined strictly on the priuciples applicable to corporations.*
The Pennsylvania cases of Presbyterian Gongregation v.
Johnston, and Commonwealth v. Green,t present some points
of contrast with the questions in this cause, especially the
latter, which relates mainly to questions of property held by
the governing body as distinguished from that of a congregation part of a larger organization.
In Kentucky, Gibson v. Armstroq,j gives a case which
assists us. Shannon v. Frost,§ is inapplicable in this cause, by
reason of the congregationalcharacter of the Baptist Church
in which it arose.
The great field for litigation of this nature has undoubtedly been Scotland, the native home of the Presbyterian
faith and form of church government.

have settled upon any definite rule by which church controversies were to be adjudged. Their unwillingness, however,
coupled with doubts as to their power to handle ecclesiastical
matters inclined them generally to refer every question involving such matters exclusively to the decision of the
Church itself. But there were difficulties in the application
of the principle, and a confused idea that in case of schism
the organic succession necessarily remained with the majority
of the local society, counterbalanced by the idea that its identity could not be preserved except in connection with the
general body of which it formed a part, caused a singular
vacillation in judicial decision. The earlier decisions, accepting as a conclusive test of right the action of a majority
of the local congregation, afforded an easy and simple rule,
so long as applied to independent churches; but when it
came to be applied to societies organized as a part of larger
bodies, where the majorities in the local and general organizations might be different, it was found not to be founded
on just or practicable principles. For a time the courts
vacillated in its application, as their views happened to lean
most strongly towards congregational independence or towards ecclesiastical connection and subordination. Fiially,
about the year 1813, came up the case of raigdailie v. Aikman,* a case bearing in some points a striking analogy to
the present. In it both of these conceptions were brought
out at different times; and an appeal to the House of Lords
drew from Lord Eldon an announcement of the principle
which was at once recognized and has since been uniformly
accepted as the true governing rule in all cases of this nature.
In the case we speak of, property had been acquired and
was held in trust for a congregation forming part of a larger
body known as Burgher Seceders, the highest judicatory in
the church being the Synod. That body having passed certain resolutions alleged to be a departure from one of the
articles of their confession, a minority protested, congregations became divided, and among other cases, the question

Argument for the appellants.

arose as to which of the two parties in this congregation
was entitled to its property. It was made a test case and
received the most careful consideration. Upon its first hearing in the Scotch Court of Session, the "majority (in interest)
in the congregation" were held to be entitled. But under
the forms of their proceeding the cause came again before
the court, and some of the judges being changed, it was
now declared that the property was held for a "society of
persons, . . . such persons always . . . continuing in communion with and subject to the ecclesiasticaldiscipline of a body
of dissenting Protestants calling themselves the Associate
Preshytery and Synod of Burgher Seceders." The effect of
these decisions was to make the question of identity or organic succession, in the one case to attach solely to a majority of the local congregation, in the other to depend upon
a continued connection with the general body. On appeal
to the H=ouse of Lords both of these views were rejected
and the following principle, first announced by Lord Eldon,
was adopted, viz.: That property conveyed for the use of a
society for purposes of religious worship, is a trust, which is
to be enforced for the purpose of maintainingthat reh~qious worship for which the property was devoted, and in the event of
schism (the deed making no provision for such case), its
uses are to be enforced, not in behalf of a majority of the
congregation, nor yet exclusively in behalf of the party adhering to the general body, but in favor of that part of the
society adhering to and maintaining the original principles upon
which it was founded.
This case, followed and recognized by that of AttorneyGeneral v. Pearson,* has been accepted in all cases of this
nature in England, Scotland, and America.
The principle of this case, so simple and just in itself, was
yet not so fully or clearly expressed as to remove' all difficulty in its application. Several important questions were
at once presented; and,
1. To the maintenance of which of the various principles

of the society does the implied trust especially refer? Does
it relate mainly to the fundamental doctrines of religious
truth, the standards of faith, or does it embrace equally all
the principles -)f doctrine, form, and order? Does it bind
the society permanently and exclusively to the same principles and to the same connections with and relations to
other societies which existed at the date of conveyance, or
does it recognize the right of change inherent in the body
by general consent, or perhaps incorporated as an original
principle in the fundamental law of the organization ? Does
it recognize that by unforeseen events beyond the control
of the society, its original connections may be changed or
broken up without its own act or assent? All of these
questions under varying forms and circumstances have been
presented, and discussed, and adjudged; and this general
principle may be considered as settled, viz.: That where
property is conveyed "for the use" or " benefit" of a designated " church," or " religious society" (the deed containing
no special limitations), such property, by operation of the
law of trusts, is held for the use of such society, subject to
the entire body or system of doctrines, rules, or principles,
whether of fhith, form, or order, held and recognized by the
society at the time of conveyance; that it binds such society
to a permanency of religious faith and a continuance of
subsisting connections, or recognizes a right of change in
doctrine, or a lawful severance of its connections, so fio
and no farther than it is bound to or released from such permanent or continuing state, by or in accordance with the
fundamental laws of the organization; that wherever the
use or control of property depends upon adherence to or a
change from original doctrines, or upon a continuance or
severance of connections with a particular judicatory, or
upon an alleged title to office in the church, or upon any
act, judgment, or proceeding of an ecclesiastical tribunal, in
every case the exclusive standard by which the conflicting
claims are to be judged is the CONSTITUTION of the church
itself.
These views are recognized and brought out with force in

the American cases of Gibson v. Armstrong and Sutter v. The
First Reformed Church.*
2. Another question, more serious and difficult than the
last, remained in determining the application of this rule of
the law of trusts, viz.: In these matters of religious doctrine,
discipline, and church order, who is to be the judge? Who
has the right to say conclusively, in case of controversy, that
one or the other party has departed from the doctrines of
the church ? Who shall determine upon the validity of an
act or judgment of a church court; upon the status of a
member or officer; upon the legality or otherwise of a voluntary or enforced'severance of a part from the body of the
general organization ?
This question was promptly raised upon the earliest application of the principle stated by Lord Eldon, and has been
decided with a frequency and uniformity rarely met with
upon any important question. Yet the court below assumed
that these matters, being of an ecclesiastical nature or arising
upon a construction of the law of the church, are subject to
exclusive cognizance and jurisdiction by the ecclesiastichl
courts, whose judgments thereon must be accepted as conclusive by the civil courts. The position assumed does not
stop with asserting that, f the decision of the question in
controversy has been committed by the constitution of the
church to a particular tribunal, or if the act or judgment in
question has been performed by such tribunal in pursuance
of a power vested in it by the constitution, in such case the
act or judgment is conclusive on the civil court. It asserts
an exclusive right in the General Assembly to determine
conclusively the extent of its own powers and duties under
the constitution; to determine in every case, whether it has
itself violated the constitution or abandoned the principles
of the faith. It asserts that the announcement of a particular doctrine or the imposition of a duty.on the church, or

the performance, rendering, or approval of an act or judgment by the General Assembly, is itself a conclusive evidence, probatio probata, that such doctrine or duty, act or
judgment, has been imposed, rendered, or performed, in

accordance with the constitution of the church; and that the
church itself and the civil courts have no power to examine
or question what has been so settled by the supreme tribunal
of the church.
If the principle of the decree herein is affirmed, it sweeps
away all limitations imposed upon church courts by their
fundamental laws and renders it impossible that churches
can -be organized under rules or limitations which shall bind
the judicatories of their own creation.
Hitherto the question has received but one solution. It
devolves upon this court authoritatively to settle it. Let us
examine the history of judicial decision.
In Galbraithv. Smith* (the first case coming before the
Scotch Court of Session after the judgment of the House of
Lords in Oraigdallie v. Aikman), the position contended for
by the appellees was accepted and announced from the
bench. Lord Meadowbank, construing thatjudgment, said
that it would have been competent for the party adhering
to the Synod to have shown as matter of fact that it having
been a fundamental rule of the sect that in the supreme judicatory alone was vested the power of determining all questions of doctrine and discipline, so the judgment of the
Synod was to be received as probatio probata of their adhernce
to their original principles; it being incompetent for
the civil court to review the decisions in such matters of
the ecclesiastical judicatories. He then stated as a general
proposition, that
"It is a legal object of such a trust, that it may profess to be
constituted with a view to perpetuity, even by placing in the
hands of a recognized body the right of controlling and modifying those rules and regulations in conformity with the funda-

mental principles of the sect of dissenting Christians to which
15 Shaw, 808, decided A.D. 1837.

;Dec. 1871.]

WATSON V. JONES.
Argument for the appellants.

those constituting the trust may have professed to adhere; and
that the civil court will not take cognizance'of the proceedings
and determinations of those judicatories, as they may be termed,
upon matters of doctrine and discipline, but hold them to be
probatio probata of the principles of the sect."
This was manifestly throwing the question back upon the
doctrine of the second judgment in the Craigdallie 'case.
Accordingly, on the next occasion calling for a review of
the principle by the Court of Session, the view taken in Galbraith v. Smith was overruled. The court say that the principle of the judgment of the H:iouse of Lords had been
"wholly misunderstood;" that Lord Meadowbank's view
"takes adherence to the Synod as conclusive and excludes inquiry into the original opinions or doctrines, if opposed to
the declaration made by the Synod, as to what those doctrines are, and is precisely the error in the Craigdallie case
again brought out and in more absolute terms." The error,
the court say, was "founded on the assumption that connection with a dissenting Synod was as decisive a criterion by
which to determine property and civil rights as adherence
to the established church. The mistake consisted in taking
as decisive what was only one element, and it might be an
element of-no importance in the inquiry, what was the original trust and which party maintains the principles;" and in
answer to the suggestion that "submission to the judicatories may be one of the original principles," the court say
"then you must prove that. It is not probatioprobata. It is
not even a presumption of law."*
The cases above referred to, relate especially to the power
of the civil courts, to examine and decide (as matter of fact)
upon questions of doctrinal dzijerences where rights of property depend upon adherence to doctrines. But the great
contest for complete ecclesiastical independence and exclusive jurisdiction was made upon another point, viz.: as to
the right of the civil court to examine and pass directly upon
the title of persons claiming official status in the church, or

upon the validity of proceedings in church courts, where
civil rights may depend on such status, or may be affected
by such proceedings. This contest, beginning about the
year 1838, in the Scotch Court of Session, several times
brought before the House of Lords, may be considered as
terminating in the celebrated Cardross Case.* Its great
importance and the deep interest excited by it, occasioned
the most profound investigation into the principles which
should regulate civil courts in their relations to the churches;
and the results have been valuable to the law. An examination of them will show these general principles to have
been settled:
i. That the church (non-established) stands before the law, in
relation to all civil interests acquired or claimed by it, precisely
as every other voluntary society for moral or scientific or other
purposes, subject in the same manner and extent to the jurisdiction of civil authority.
ii. That in so far as the law can regard them, the powers of
the church judicatories are derived solely from the consent of
the members of the church, as expressed in their fundamental
law; that they are not "courts" and have no "jurisdiction" in
the strict sense of the terms-these terms necessarily implying
the existence of a power conferred by and vested in functionaries of the state. They are not " courts" except of the parties'
own choosing.
iii. That in so far as the fundamental laws of the church confer powers on its tribunals, the civil courts will recognize them,
and where civil rights are involved, will give effect to their exercise without inquiring into the motives or grounds of action
of the ecclesiastical tribunal; and will enforce with the same
respect the action of the inferior tribunal acting within its
sphere, as they will that of the supreme court of the church.
iv. That the jurisdiction of civil courts being confined to "civil
actions," they may not take cognizance of purely spiritual or
ecclesiastical questions, as such; just as they may not take cognizance of any moral or scientific questions for the purpose of
determining upon their abstract truth; but that in every case

Argument for the appellants.

of controversy, where a right of property depends upon an adherence to religious doctrine, or is affected by an act or judgment of an ecclesiastical tribunal, the civil court will examine
into such doctrine as matter of fact, for the purpose of determining which party maintains the original principles of the society,
and will examine into the act or judgment of the ecclesiastical
court, for the purpose of determining whether it is in contravention of the fundamental law of the church, or without authority
from it; in which latter case, such act or judgment will be
esteemed void and be disregarded. In these several cases the exclusive standard of judgment is the CONSTITUTION of the church

itself.
These principles, first announced with reference to the
high claims of the Established Church of Scotland, were
afterwards 'repeated with equal deliberation in reference to
the Free Church, which having withdrawn from the Establishment on account of these decisions, reasserted in its
voluntary character its claim to ecclesiastical independence.
A reference to the Cardross Case will show how it was
presented, and met. A Presbytery having tried a minister
for misconduct, adjudged (partially) against him; and the
Synod on appeal reversed its action. Upon appeal to the
General Assembly, that body took up the case de novo and
passed a sentence more extensive than that of the Presbytery'. The minister, whose civil rights were affected by this
judgment, applied to the civil court for its "reduction," on
the ground that the Assembly being confined to an appellate
power by the constitution of the church, had transcended its
authority by passing an original sentence upon him. The
General Assembly among others filed the following pleas:
1st. "That the sentences complained of, being spiritual acts,
done in the ordinary course of discipline of a Christian Church
tolerated and protected by law, it is not competent for the civil
court to reduce them, and the actions should therefore be dismissed."
2d. "As the actions, so far as they conclude for a reduction
of the sentences complained of, do not relate to any question of
civil right, they cannot be maintained."

WATSON V. JONES.

[Sup. Or.

Argument for the appellants.

Upon argument and a full review of all the cases, both of
these pleas were overruled. The cause did not reach a
hearing upon the pleas touching the actual powers of the
Assembly under the constitution; but those decided are
alone important in this discussion.*
If then the controlling principles of law touching this
matter have been correctly stated, it follows in this Walnut
Street Church case, that if it shall appear that the majority
have abandoned, while the minority adhere to the original
principles of the society, the judgment must go in favor of
the minority.
The General Assembly is not excepted from the obligation of the rule. If a doubt upon this point should otherwise exist, it would be removed by a consideration of the
commiission under which alone its members act and hold their
places, and by which they are severally restricted to sit, consult, vote, and determine, on all things that may come before
that body "according to the principles and constitution of
this church, and the word of God." Even those general
clauses in the Form of Government touching the powers of
Assembly to "decide controversies," and to "suppress
schismatical contentions and disputatious," are to be exercised not wantonly, but in accordance with the fixed provisions elsewhere stated. They contemplate controversies,
contentions, and disputations, to which there may be parties
and proceedings, by which these matters may be constitutionally brought before the Assembly.

out generally in the Reporter's statement of the case, went
into a very interesting examination of the constitution and
fundamental principles of that church, and sought to show
that those Declaratory Statements or Resolutions "whereby
the church had pledged herself, in her ecclesiastical capacity, to an unabated loyalty to the civil government, and
one great section of the church was prejudged as traitors,"
were in violation of its fundamental principles; and a departure from those sacred standa'ds which declare that the

to "sustain or in any manner assist in the execution" of

This case belongs to a class, happily rare in our courts, in

maintenance of rights which the church has refused to acknowledge, or found itself unable to protect. Much as such

be regretted, a regret which is increased when passing from
the control of the judicial and legislative bodies of the entire
organization to which the society belongs, an appeal is made
to the secular authority; the courts when so called oil must
perform their functions as in other cases.
Religious organizations come before us in the same attitude as other voluntary associations for benevolent or charitable purposes, and their rights of property, or of contract,
are equally under the protection of the law, and the actions
of their members subject to its restraints. Conscious as we
may be of the excited feeling engendered by this controversy, and of the extent to which it has agitated the intelligent and pious body of Christians in whose bosom. it originated, we enter upon its consideration with the satisfaction
of knowing that the principles on which we are to decide so
much of it as is proper for our decision, are those applicable
alike to all of its class, and that our duty is the simple one
of applying those principles to the facts before us.
The first of the points arising in the case concerns the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, which is denied; first, on
the ground that the plaintiffs have no such interest in the
subject of litigation as will enable them to maintain the suit,
and, secondly, on matters arising out of the alleged proceedings in the suit in the Chancery Court of Louisville.
The allegation that the plaintiffs are not lawful members
of the Walnut Street Church is based upon the assumption
that their admission as members was by a pastor and elders
who had no lawful authority to act as such. As the claim
of those elders to be such is one of the matters which this
bill is brought to establish, and the denial of which makes
an issue to be tried, it is obvious that the objection to the
interest of the plaintiffs must stand or fall with the decision
on the merits, and cannot be decided as a preliminary question. Their right to have this question decided, if there is
no other objection to the jurisdiction, cannot be doubted.
Some attempt is made in the answer to question the good
faith of their citizenship, but this seems to have been abandoned in the argument.

DWATSON V. JONES.
Opinion of the court.

In regard to the suit in the Chancery Court of Louisville,
whiclf the defendants allege to be pending, there can be no
doubt but that that court is one competent to entertain jurisdiction of all the matters set up in the present suit. As to
those matters, and to the parties, it is a court of concurrent
jurisdiction with the Circuit Court of the United States, and
as between those courts the rule is applicable that the one
which has first obtained jurisdiction in a given case must
retain it exclusively until it disposes of it by a final judgment or decree.
But when the pendency of such a suit is set up to defeat
another, the case must be the same. There must be the
same parties, or at least such as represent the same interest,
there must be the same rights asserted, and the same relief
prayed for. This relief must be founded on the same facts,
and the-title or essential basis of the relief sought must be
the same. Th-eideiiity in these particulars should be such
that if the pending case had already been disposed of, it
could be pleaded in bar as a former adjudication of the same
matter between the same parties.
In the case of Barrows v. Kindred,* which was an action
of ejeetment, the plaintiff showed a good title to the land,
and the defendant relied on a former judgment in his favor,
between the same parties for the same land; the statute of
Illinois making a judgment in such an action as conclusive as
in other personal actions, except by way of new trial. But
this court held that as in the second suit the plaintiff introduced and relied upon a new and different title, acquired
since the first trial, that judgment could be no bar, because
that title had not been passed upon by the court in the first
suit.
But the principles which should govern in regard to the
identity of the matters in issue in the two suits to make the
pendency of the one defeat the other, are as fully discussed,
in the case of Buck v. Colbath,t where that was the main
question, as in any case -we have been able to find. It was

an action of trespass, brought in a State court, against the
marshal of the Circuit Court of the United States for seizing
property of the plaintiff, under a writ of attachment from
the Circuit Court. And it was brought while the suit in the
Federal court was still pending, and while the marshal held
the property subject to its judgment. So far as the lis
peflens
an(d possession of the property in one court, and a suit brought
for the taking by its officer in another, are toncerned, the
analogy to the present case is very strong. In that case the
court said: "It is not true that a court, having obtained
jurisdiction of a subject-matter of suit and of parties before
it, thereby excludes all other courts from the right to adjudicate upon other matters having a very close connection
with those before the first court, and in some instances requiring the decision of the same question exactly. In examining into the exclusive character of the jurisdiction in
such cases, we must have regard to the nature of the remedies, the character of the relief sought, and the identity of
the parties in the different suits." And it might have been
added, to the facts on which the claim for relief is founded.
"_A party," says the court by way of example, "having
notes secured by a mortgage on real estate, may, unless restrained by statute, sue in a court of chancery to foreclose
his mortgage, and in a court of law to recover a judgment
on his notes, and in another court of law in an action of ejectment for possession of the land. Here, in all the suits, the
only question at issue may be the existence of the debt
secured by the mortgage. But, as the relief sought is different, and the mode of proceeding different, the jurisdiction
of neither court is affected by the proceedings in the other."
This opinion contains a critical review of the cases in this
court of Kagan v. Lucas,* Peck v. Jcnness,t Taylor v. C(oarryl,
and Freentan v. Howe,§ cited and relied on by counsel for the
appellants; and we are satisfied that it states tie doctrine
correctly.

our giving at length, the pleadings in the case in the Louisville Chancery Court. But we cannot better state what is,
and what is not, the subject-matter of that suit or controversy, as thus presented and as shown throughout its course,
than by adopting the language of the Court of Appeals of
Kentucky, in its opinion delivered at the decision of that
suit, in favor of the present appellants. "As suggested in
argument," says the court, "and apparently conceded on
both sides, this is not a case of division or schism in a
church; nor is there any question as to which of two bodies
should be recognized as the Third or Walnut Street Presbyterian Church. Neither is there any controversy as to the
authority of Watson and Galt to act as ruling elders; but
the sole inquiry to which we are restricted in our opinion is,
whether Avery, McNaughtan, and Leach are also ruling
elders, and therefore members of the session of the church."
, The pleadings in the present suit show conclusively a dif
ferent state of facts, different issues, and a different relief
sought. This is a case of a division or schism in the church.
It is a question as to which of two bodies shall be recognized
as the Third or Walnut Street Presbyterian Church. There
is a controversy as to the authority of Watson and Galt to
act as ruling elders, that authority being denied in.the bill
of the complainants; and, so far from the claim of Avery,
McNaughtan, and Leach to be ruling elders being the sole
inquiry in this case, it is a very subordinate matter, and it
depends upon facts and circumstances altogether different
from those set up and relied on in the other suit, and which
did not exist when it was brought. The issue here is no
longer a mere question of eldership, but it is a separation
of the original church members and officers into two distinct
bodies, with distinct members and officers, each claiming to
be the true Walnut Street Presbyterian Church, and denying the right of the other to any such claim. This brief
statement of the issues in the two suits leaves no room for
argument to show that the pendency of the first cannot be
pleaded either in bar or in abatement of the second.
The supplementary petition filed by the plaintiffs in that

case, after the decree of the Chancery Court had been reversed on appeal, and which did contain very much the same
matter found in the present bill, was, on motion of the plaintiffs' counsel, and by order of the court, dismissed, without
prejudice, before this suit was brought, and of course was
not a Us pendens at that time.
It is contended, however, that the delivery to the trustees
and elders of the body of which the plaintiffs are members,
of the possession of the church building cannot be granted
in this suit, nor call the defendants be enjoined from taking
possession as prayed in the bill, because the property is in
the actual possession of the marshal of the Louisville Chancery Court as its receiver, and because there is an unexecuted decree of that court ordering the marshal to deliver
the possession to defendants.
In this the counsel for the appellants are, in our opinion,
sustained, both by the law and by the state of the record of
the suit in that court.
The court, in the progress of that suit, made several orders
concerning the use of the church, and finally placed it in the
possession of the marshal as a receiver, and there is no order
dischai:ging his receivership; nor does it seem to us that
there is ally valid order finally disposing of the case, so that it
call be said to be no longer in that court. For, though the
Chancery Court did, on the 20th March, 1868, after the reversal of the case in the Court of Appeals, enter al order
reversing its former decree and dismissing the bill, with
costs, in favor of the defendants, the latter, on application to
the appellate court, obtained another order dated June 26th.
By this order, or mandate to the Chancery Court, it was directed to render a judgment in conformity to the opinion and
mandate of the court, restoring possession, use, and control
of the church property to the parties entitled thereto, according to said opinion, and so far as they were deprived thereof
by the marshal of the Chancery Court under its order.
In obedience to this mandate the Chancery Court, on the
18th September, three months after the commencement of

Dec. 1871.]

W~ATSON V. JO0NES.
Opinion of the court.

this suit, made an order that the marshal restore the possession, use, and control of the church building to Henry
Farley, George Fulton, B. F. Avery, or a majority of them,
as trustees, and to John Watson, Joseph Galt, and T. J.
Hackney, or a majority of them, as ruling elders, and to report how he had executed the order, and reserving the case
for such further order as might be necessary to enforce full
obedience.
It is argued here by counsel for the appellees that the case
was, in effect, disposed of by the orders of the Chancery
Court, and that nothing remained to be done which could
have any practical operation on the rights of the parties.
But if the Court of Appeals, in reversing the decree of
the chancellor in favor of the plaintiffs, was of opinion that
the defendants should be restored to the position they occupied in regard to the possession and control of the property
before that suit began, we have no doubt of their right to
make such order as was necessary to effect that object; and
as the proper mode of doing this was by directing the chancellor to make the necessary order, and have it enforced as
chancery decrees are enforced in his court, we are of opinion
that the order of the Court of Appeals, above recited, was
in essence and effect, a decree in that cause for such restoration5 and that the last order of the Chancery Court, made in
accordance with it, is a valid subsisting decree, which, though
final, is unexecuted.
The decisions of this court in the cases of Taylor v. Carryl,*
and _7 eernan v. .owe,t and Buck v. Colbath,t are conclusive
that the marshal of the Chancery Court cannot be displaced
as to the mere actual possession of the property, because
that might lead to a personal conflict between the officers of
the two courts for that possession. And the act of Congress
of March 2d, 1793,§ as construed in the cases of Diggs v.
Wolcot,I1 and Peck v. Jenness, are equally conclusive against
any injunction from the Circuit Court, forbidding the defend*

ants to take the possession which the unexecuted decree of
the Chancery Court requires the marshal to deliver to tlern.
But, though the prayer of the bill in this suit does ask for
an injunction to restrain Watson, Galt, Fulton, and Farley
from taking possession, it also prays such other and further
relief as the nature of. the case requires, and especially that
said defendants be restrained from interfering with Hays, as
pastor, and plaintiffs in worshipping in said church. Under
this prayer for general relief, if there was any decree which
the Circuit Court could render for the protection of the right
of the plaintiffs, and which did not enjoin the defendants from
taking possession of the church property, and which did not
disturb the possession of the marshal of the Louisville chancery, that court had a right to hear the case and grant that
relief. This leads us to inquire what is the nature and
character of the possession to which those parties are to be
restored.
One or two propositions which seem to admit of no controversy are proper to be noticed in this connection. 1.
Both by the act of the Kentucky legislature creating the
trustees of the church a body corporate, and by the acknowledged rules of the Presbyterian Church, the trustees
were the mere nominal title-holders and custodians of the
church property, and other trustees were, or could be elected
by the congregation, to supply their places once in every
two years. 2. That in the use of the property for all religious services or ecclesiastical purposes, the trustees were
under the control of the church session. 3. That by the
constitution of all Presbyterian churches, the session, which
is the governing body in each, is composed of the ruling
elders and pastor, and in all business of the session the majority of its members govern, the number of elders for each
congregation being variable.
The trustees obviously hold possession for the use of the
persons who by the constitution, usages, and laws of the
Presbyterian body, are entitled to that use. They are liable
to removal by the congregation for whom they hold this
trust, and others may be substituted in their places. They

Opinion of the court.

have no personal ownership or right beyond this, and are
subject in their official relations to the property, to the control of the session of the church.
The possession of the elders, though accompanied with
larger and more efficient powers of control, is still a fiduciary
possession. It is as a session of the church alone that they
could exercise power. Except by an order of the session in
regular meeting they have no right to make any order concerning the use of the building; and any action of the session is necessarily in the character of representatives of the
church body by whose members it was elected.
If then, this true body of the church, the members of that
congregation, having rights of user in the building, have in
a mode which is authorized by the canons of the general
church in this country elected and installed other elders, it
does not seem to us inconsistent or at variance with the
nature of the possession which we have described, and which
the Chancery Court orders to be restored to the defendants,
that they should be compelled to recognize these rights, and
permit those who are the real beneficiaries of the trust held
by them, to enjoy the uses, to protect which that trust was
created. Undoubtedly if the order of the Chancery Court
had been executed, and the marshal had delivered the key
of the church to the defendants, and placed them in the same
position they were in before that suit was commenced, they
could in any court having jurisdiction and in a case properly
made out, be compelled to respect the rights we have stated,
an*d be controlled in their use of the possession by the court,
so far as to secure those rights.
All that we have said in regard to the possession which
the marshal is directed to deliver to the defendants, is equally
applicable to the possession held by him pending the execution of that order. His possession is a substitute for theirs,
and the order under which he received that possession,
which we have recited, shows this very clearly.
The decree which we are now reviewing seems to us to
be carefully framed on this view of the matter. While the
rights of the plaintiffs and those whom they sue for, are adVOL. XIII.

Opinion of the court.

mitted and established, the defendants are still recognized
as entitled to the possession which we have described; and
while they are not enjoined from receiving that possession
froni the marshal, and he is not restrained from obeying the
Chancery Court by delivering it, and while there is no order
made on the marshal at all to interfere with his possession,
the defendants are required by the decree to respect the
rights of the plaintiffs, and to so use the possession and control to which they may be restored as not to hinder or obstruct the true uses of the trust, which that possession is intended to protect.
We are next to inquire whether the decree thus rendered
is based upon an equally just view of the law as applied to
the facts of this controversy.
The questions which have come before the civil courts
concerning the rights to property held by ecclesiastical
bodies, may, so far as we have been able to examine them,
be profitably classified under three general heads, which of
course do not include cases governed by considerations applicable to a church established and supported by law as the
religion of the state.
1. The first of these is when the property which is the
subject of controversy has been, by the deed or will of the
donor, or other instrument by which the property is held,
by the express terms of the instrument devoted to the teaching, support, or spread of some specific form of religious
doctrine or belief.
2. The second is when the property is held by a religious
congregation which, by the nature of its organization, is
strictly independent of other ecclesiastical associations, and
so far as church government is concerned, owes no fealty or
obligation to any higher authority.
3. The third is where the religious congregation or ecelesiastical body holding the property is but a subordinate
member of some general church organization in which there
are sbperior ecclesiastical tribunals with a general and ultimate power of control more or less complete, in some su-

:Dec. 1871.]

WATSON

V. JONES.

Opinion of the court.

preme judicatory over the whole membership of thit general
organization.
In regard to the first of these classes it seems hardly to
admit of a rational doubt that an individual or an association
of individuals may dedicate property by way of trust to the
purpose of sustaining, supporting, and propagating definite
religious doctrines or principles, provided that in doing so
they violate no law of morality, and give to the instrument
by which their purpose is evidenced, the formalities which
the laws require. And it would seem also to be the obvious
duty of the court, in a case properly made, to see that the
property so dedicated is not diverted from the trust which
is thus attached to its use. So long as there are persons
qualified within the meaning of the original dedication, and
who are also willing to teach the doctrines or principles prescribed in the act of dedication, and so long as there is any
one so interested in the execution of the trust as to have a
standing in court, it must be that they can prevent the diversion of the property or fund to other and different uses.
This is the general doctrine of courts of equity as to charities, and it seems equally applicable to ecclesiastical matters.
In such case, if the trust is confided to a religious congregation of the independent or congregational form of church
government, it is not in the power of the majority of that
congregation, however preponderant, by reason of a change
of views on religious subjects, to carry the property so confided to them to the support of new and conflicting doctrine.
A pious man building and dedicating a house of worship to
the sole and exclusive use of those who believe in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and placing it under the control
of a congregation which at the time holds the same belief;
has a right to expect that the law will prevent that property
from being used as a means of support and dissemination
of the Unitarian doctrine, and as a place of Unitarian worship. Nor is the principle varied when the organization to
which the trust is confided is of the second or associated
form of church government. The protection which the law

WATSON V. JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

throws around the trust is the same. And though the task
may be a delicate one and a difficult one, it will be the duty
of the court in such cases, when the doctrine to be taught or
the form of worship to be used is definitely and clearly laid
down, to inquire whether the party accused of violating the
trust is holding or teaching a different doctrine, or using a
form of worship which is so far variant as to defeat the declared objects of the trust. In the leading case on this subject, in the English courts, of the Allorney-General v. Pearson,* Lord Eldon said, "I agree with the defendants that the
religious belief of the parties is irrelevant to the matters in
dispute, except so far as the King's Court is called upon to
execute the trust." That ivas a case in which the trust-deed
declared the house which was erected under it was for the
worship and service of. God. And though we may not be
satisfied with the very artificial and elaborate argument by
which the chancellor arrives at the conclusion, that because
any other view of the nature of the Godhead than the Trinitarian view was heresy by the laws of England, and any one
giving expression to the Unitarian view was liable to be
severely punished for heresy by the secular courts, at the
time the deed was made, that the trust was, therefore, for
Trinitarian worship, we may still accept the statement that
the court has the right to enforce a trust clearly defined on
such a subject.
The case of Miller v. Gablet appears to have been decided
in the Court of Errors of New York on this principle, so far
as any ground of decision can be gathered from the opinions
of the majority of the. court as reported.
The second class of cases which we have described has
reference to the case of a church of a strictly congregational
or independent organization, governed solely within itself,
either by a majority of its members or by such other local

trust attached to it in the hands of the church than'that it is
for the use of that congregation as a religious society.
In such cases where there is a schism which leads to a
separation into distinct and conflicting bodies, the rights of
such bodies to the use of the property must be determined
by the ordinary principles which govern voluntary associations. If the principle of government in such cases is that
the majority rules, then the numerical majority of members
must control the right to the use of the property. If there
be within the congregation officers in whom are vested the
powers of such control, then those who adhere to the acknowledged organism by which the body is governed are
entitled to the use of the property. The minority in choosing to separate themselves into a distinct body, and refusing
to recognize the authority of the governing body, can claim
no rights in the property from the fact that they had once
been members of the church or congregation. This.ruling
admits of no inquiry into the existing religious opinions of
those who comprise the legal or regular organization; for, if
such was permitted, a very small minority, without any officers of the church among them, might be found to be the
only faithful supporters of the religious dogmas of the founders of the church. There being no such trust imposed upon
the property when purchased or given, the court will not
imply one for the purpose of expelling from its use those
who by regular succession and order constitute the church,
because they may have changed in some respect their views
of religious truth.
Of the cases inwhich this doctrine is applied no better
representative can be found than that of Shannon v. .M'ost,*
where the principle is ably supported by the learned Chief
Justice of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky.
The case of Smith v. 1\elson,t asserts this doctrine in a case
where a legacy was left to the Associate Congregation of
Ryegate, the interest whereof was to be annually paid to
their minister forever. In that case, though the Ryegate

Opinion of the court.

congregation was one of a number of Presbyterian churches
connected with the general Presbyterian body at large, the
court held that the only inquiry was whether the society still
exists, and whether they have a minister chosen and appointed by the majority and regularly ordained over the
society, agreeably to the usage of that denomination. And
though we may be of opinion that the doctrine of that case
needs modification, so far as it discusses the relation of the
Ryegate congregation to the other judicatories of the body
to which it belongs, it certainly lays down the principle correctly if that congregation was to be treated as an independent one.
But the third of these classes of cases is the one which is
oftenest found in the courts, and which, with reference to
the number and difficulty of the questions involved, and to
other considerations, is every way the most important.
It is the case of property acquired in any of the usual
modes for the general use of a religious congregation which
is itself part of a large and general organization of some
religious denomination, with which it is more or less intimately connected by religious views and ecclesiastical government.
The case before us is one of this class, growing out of a
schism which has divided the congregation and its officers,
and the presbytery and synod, and which appeals to the
courts to determine the right to the use of the property so
acquired. Here is no case of property devoted forever by
the instrument which conveyed it, or by any specific declaration of its owner, to the support of any special religious
dogmas, or any peculiar form of worship, but of property
purchased for the use of a religious congregation, and so
long as any existing religious congregation can be ascertained to be that congregation, or its regular and legitimate
successor, it is entitled to the use of the property. In the
case of an independent congregation we have pointed out
how this identity, or succession, is to be ascertained, but in
cases of this character we are bound to look at the fact that
the local congregation is itself but a member of a much

larger and more important religious organizationi, and is
under its government and control, and is bound by its orders
and judgments. There are in the Presbyterian system of
ecclesiastical government, in regular succession, the presbytery over the session or local church, the synod over the
presbytery, and the General Assembly over all. These are
called, in the language of the church organs, "judicatories,"
and they entertain appeals from the decisions of those below,
and prescribe corrective measures in other cases.
In this class of cases we think the rule of action which
should govern the civil courts, founded in a broad and sound
view of the relations of church and state under our system
of laws, and supported by a preponderating weight of
judicial authority is, that, whenever the questions of discipline, or of faith, or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law have
been decided by the highest of these church judicatories to
which the matter has been carried, the legal tribunals must
accept such decisions as final, and as binding on them, in
their application to the case before them.
We concede at the outset that the doctrine of the English
courts is otherwise. In the case of the Attorney-General v.
-Pearson,cited before, the proposition is laid down by Lord
Eldon, and sustained by the peers, that it is the duty of the
court in such cases to inquire and decide for itself, not only
what was the nature and power of these church judicatories,
but what is the true standard of faith in the church organization, and which of the contending parties before the court
holds to this standard. And in the subsequent case of Craigdallie v. Aikman,* the same learned judge expresses in strong
terms his chagrin that the Court of Sessions of Scotland,
from which the case had been appealed, had failed to find
on this latter subject, so that he could rest the case on religious belief, but had declared that in this matter there was
no difference between the parties. And we can very well
understand how the Lord Chancellor of England, who is, in
his office, in a large sense, the head and representative of

WATSON V. JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

the Established Church, who controls very largely the church
patronage, and whose judicial decision may be, and not unfrequently is, invoked in cases of heresy and ecclesiastical
contumacy, should feel, even in dealing with a dissenting
church, but little delicacy in grappling with the most abstruse problems of theological controversy, or in construing
the instruments which those churches have adopted as their
rules of government, or inquiring into their customs and
usages. The dissenting church in England is not a free
church in the sense in which we apply the term in this
country, and it was much less free in Lord Eldon's time
than now. Laws then existed upon the statute-book hampering the free exercise of religious belief and worship in
many most oppressive forms, and though Protestant dissenters were less burdened than Catholics and Jews, there did
not exist that full, entire, and practical freedom for all forms
of religious belief and practice which lies at the foundation
of our political principles. And it is quite obvious, from an
examination of the series of cases growing out of the organization of the Free Church of Scotland, found in Shaw's Reports of Cases in the Court of Sessions, that it was only
under the pressure of Lord Eldon's ruling, established in
the House of Lords, to which final appeal lay in such cases,
that the doctrine was established in the Court of Sessions
after no little struggle and resistance. The full history of
the case of 0-aigdalliev. Aikman, in the Scottish court, which
we cannot further pursue, and the able opinion of Lord
Meadowbank in Galbraith v. Snith,* show this conclusively.
In this country the full and free right to entertain any
religious belief, to practice any religious principle, and to
teach any religious doctrine which does not violate the laws
of morality and property, and which does not infringe personal rights, is conceded to all. The law knows no heresy,
and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establishment of no sect. The right to organize voluntary religious
associations to assist in the expression and dissemination of

any religious doctrine, and to create tribunals for the decision'of controverted questions of faith within the association, and for the ecclesiastical government of all the individual members, congregations, and officers within the
general association, is unquestioned. All who unite themselves to such a body do so with an implied consent to this
government, and are bound to submit to it. But it would
be a vain consent and would lead to the total subversion of
such religious bodies, if any one aggrieved by one of their
decisions could appeal to the secular courts and have them
reversed. It is of the essence of these religious unions, and
of their right to establish tribunals for the decision of questions arising among themselves, that those decisions should
be binding in all cases of ecclesiastical cognizance, subject
only to such appeals as the organism itself provides for.
Nor do we see that justice would be likely to be promoted
by submitting those decisions to review in the'ordinary judicial tribunals. Each of these large and influential bodies
(to mention no others, let reference be had to the Protestant
Episcopal, the Methodist Episcopal, and the Presbyterian
churches), has a body of constitutional and ecclesiastical
law of its own, to be found in their written organic laws,
their books of discipline, in their collections of precedents,
in their usage and customs, which as to each constitute a
system of ecclesiastical law and religious faith that tasks the
ablest minds to become familiar with. It is not to be supposed that the judges of the civil courts can be as competent
in the ecclesiastical law and religious faith of all these
bodies as the ablest men in each are in reference to their
own. It would therefore be an appeal from the more learned
tribunal in the law which should decide the case, to one
which is less so.
We have said that these views' are supported by the preponderant weight of authority in this country, and for the
reasons which we have given, we do not think the doctrines
of the English Chancery Court on this subject should have
with us the influence which we would cheerfully accord to
it on others.

WATSON V. JONES.

[Sup. Cr.

Opinion of the court.

We have already cited* the case of Shannon v. Frost, in
which the appellate court of the State where this controversy originated, sustains the proposition clearly and fully.
"This court," says the Chief Justice, "having no ecclesiastical jurisdiction, cannot revise or question ordinary acts of
church discipline. Our only judicial power in the case arises
from the conflicting claims of the parties to the church property and the use of it. We cannot decide who ought to be
members of the church, nor whether the excommunicated
have been justly or unjustly, regularly or irregularly cut off
from the body of the church."
In the subsequent case of Gibson v. Armstrong,t which
arose out of the general division of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, we understand the same principles to be laid down
as governing that case, and in the case of Watson v. Arery,l
the case relied on by the appellants as a bar, and considered
in the former part of this opinion, the doctrine of Shannon
v. Frost is in general terms conceded, while a distinction is
attempted which we shall consider hereafter.
One of the most careful and well-considered judgments
on the subject is that of the Court of Appeals of South
Carolina, delivered by Chancellor Johnson in the case of
Rarmon v. Dreher.§ The case turned upon certain rights in
the use of the church property claimed by the minister notwithstanding his expulsion from the synod as one of its
members. "ie stands," says the chancellor, "convicted of
the offences alleged against him, by the sentence of the
spiritual body of which he was a voluntary member, and
whose proceedings he had bound himself to abide. It belongs not to the civil power to enter into or review the
proceedings of a spiritual court. The structure of our government has, for the preservation of civil liberty, rescued
the temporal institutions from religious interference. On
the other hand, it has secured religious liberty from the invasion of the civil authority. The judgments, therefore, of

Opinion of the court..

religious associations, bearing on their own members, are
not examinable here, and I am not to inquire whether the
doctrines attributed to Mr. Dreher were held by him, or
whether if held were anti-Lutheran; or whether his conduct
was or was not in accordance with the duty he owed to the
synod or to his denomination. . . . When a civil right depends upon an ecclesiastical matter, it is the civil court and
not the ecclesiastical which is to decide. But the civil
tribunal tries the civil right, and no more, taking the ecclesiastical decisions out of which the civil right arises as it
finds them." The principle is reaffirmed by the same court
in the John's Island Church Case.*
In Den v. Bolton,t the Supreme Court of New Jersey asserts the same principles, and though founding its decision
mainly on a statute, it is said to be true on general principles.
The Supreme Court of Illinois, in the case of Ferraria
v. Vasconcelles,t refers to the case of Shannon v. Il'osl with
approval, and adopts the language of the court that "the
judicial eye cannot penetrate the veil of the church for the
forbidden purpose of vindicating the alleged wrongs of excised members; when they became members they did so
upon the condition of continuing or not as they and their
churches might determine, ana they thereby submit to the
ecclesiastical power and cannot now invoke the supervisory
power of the civil tribunals."
In the very important case of Chase v. Cheny, recently decided in the same court, Judge Lawrence, who dissented,
says, "We understand the opinion as implying that in the
administration of ecclesiastical discipline, and where no
other right of property is involved than loss of the clerical
office or salary incident to such discipline, a spiritual court
is the exclusive judge of its own jurisdiction, and that its
decision of that question is binding on the secular courts."
And he dissents with Judge Sheldon from the opinion because it so holds.

WATSON

V. JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

In the case of Watson v. Farris,*which was a case growing
out of the schism in the Presbyterian Church in Missouri
in regard to this same Declaration and Testimony and the
action of the General Assembly, that court held that whether
a case was regularly or irregularly before the Assembly was
a question which the Assembly had the right to determine
for itself, and no civil court could reverse, modify, or impair
its action in a matter of merely ecclesiastical concern.
We cannot better close this review of the authorities than
in the language of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in
the case of the German Reformed Church v. Seibert :t "The
decisions of ecclesiastical courts, like every other judicial
tribunal, are final, as they are the best judges of what constitutes an offence against the word of God and the discipline of the church. Any other than those courts must be
incompetent judges of matters of faith, discipline, and doctrine; and civil courts, if they should be so unwise as to
attempt to supervise their judgments on matters which come
within their jurisdiction, would only involve themselves in
a sea of uncertainty and doubt which would do anything
but improve either religion or good morals."
In the subsequent case of McGinnis v. Watson,T this principle is again applied and supported by a more elaborate
argument.
The Court of Appeals of Kentucky, in the case of Watson v. Avery, before referred to, while admitting the general
principle here laid down, maintains that when a decision
of an ecclesiastical tribunal is set up in the civil courts, it
is always open to inquiry whether the tribunal acted within
its jurisdiction, and if it did not, its decision could not be
conclusive.
There is, perhaps, no word in legal terminology so frcquently used as the word jurisdiction, so capable of use in
a general and vague sense, and which is used so often by
men learned in the law without a due regard to precision in
its application. As regards its use in the matters we have

been discussing it may very well be conceded that if the
General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church should undertake to try one of its members for murder, and punish him
with death or imprisonment, its sentence would be of no
validity in a civil court or anywhere else. Or if it should at
the instance of one of its members entertain jurisdiction as
between him and another member as to their individual right
to property, real or personal, the right in no sense depending on ecclesiastical questions, its decision would be utterly
disregarded by any civil court where it might be set up.
And it might be said in a certain general sense very justly,
that it was because the General Assembly had no jurisdiction
of the case. Illustrations of this character could be multiplied in which the proposition of the Kentucky court would
be strictly applicable.
But it is a very different thing where a subject-matter
of dispute, 'strictly and purely ecclesiastical in its character,-a matter over which the civil courts exercise no jurisdiction,-a matter which concerns theological controversy,
church discipline, ecclesiastical government, or the conformity of the members of the church to the standard of morals
required of them,-becomes the subject of its action. It may
be said here, also, that no jurisdiction has been conferred on
the tribunal to try the particular case before it, or that, in
its judgment, it exceeds the powers conferred upon it, or
that the laws of the church do not authorize the particular
form of proceeding adopted; and, in a sense often used in
the courts, all of those may be said to be questions of jurisdiction. But it is easy to see that if the civil courts are to
inquire into all these matters, the whole subject of the doctrinal theology, the usages and customs, the written laws,
and fundamental organization of every religious denomina.
tion may, and must, be examined into with minuteness and
care, for they would become, in almost every case, the criteria by which the validity of the ecclesiastical decree would
be determined in the civil court. This principle would deprive these bodies of the right of construing their own
church laws, would open the way to all the evils which we

WATSON V.

JONES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

have depicted as attendant upon the doctrine of Lord Eldon,
and would, in effect, transfer to the civil courts where property rights were concerned the decision of all ecclesiastical
questions.
And this is precisely what the Court of Appeals of Kentucky did in the case of Watson v. Avery. Under cover of
inquiries into the jurisdiction of the synod and presbytery
over the congregation, and of the General Assembly over all,
it went into an elaborate examination of the principles of
Presbyterian church government, and ended by overruling
the decision of the highest judicatory of that church in the
United States, both on the jurisdiction and the merits; and,
substituting its own judgment for that of the ecclesiastical
court, decides that ruling elders, declared to be such by that
tribunal, are not such, and must not be recognized by the
congregation, though four-fifths of its members believe in
the judgment of the Assembly and desired to conform to its
decree.
But we need pursue this subject no further. Whatever
may have been the case before the Kentucky court, the appellants in the case presented to us have separated themselves wholly from the church organization to which they
belonged when this controversy commenced. They now
deny its authority, denounce its action, and refuse to abide
by its judgments. They have first erected themselves into
a new organization, and have since joined themselves to another totally different, if not hostile, to the one to which
they belonged when the difficulty first began. Under any
of the decisions which we have examined, the appellants, in
their present position, have no right to the property, or to
the use of it, which is the subject of this suit.
The novelty of the questions presented to this court for
the first time, their intrinsic importance and far-reaching influence, and the knowledge that the schism in which the case
originated has divided the Presbyterian churches throughout Kentucky and Missouri, have seemed to us to justify the
careful and laborious examination and discussion which we

have made of the principles which should govern the case.
For the same reasons we have held it under advisement for
a year; not uninfluenced by the hope, that since the civil
commotion, which evidently lay at the foundation of the
trouble, has passed away, that charity, which is so large an
element in the faith of both parties, and which, by one of
the apostles of that religion, is said to be the greatest of all
the Christian virtues, would have brought about a reconciliation. But we have been disappointed. It is not for us to
determine or apportion the moral responsibility which at'taches to the parties for this result. We can only pronounce
the judgment of the law as applicable to the case presented
to us, and that requires us to affirm the decree of the Circuit Court as it stands.
DECREE AFFIRMED.

The CHIEF JUSTICE did not sit on the argument of
this case, and took no part in its decision.
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD, with whom concurred Mr. Justice DAVIS, dissenting.
I dissent from the opinion and decree of the court in this
case, and inasmuch as the case presents an iniportant question of jurisdiction, I deem it proper to state in a few words
the grounds of my dissent.
Before this suit was commenced, a suit in respect to the
same subject-matter and substantially between the same
parties had been instituted in the Chancery Court of Louisville, by parties representing the same interests as those
prosecuted in this case by the appellees, and they obtained
a final decree in their favor against the respondents therein,
representing the same interests as those defended by the
present appellants. Whereupon the respondents in that
suit appealed to the Court of Appeals of that State, where
the decree of the Chancery Court was in all things reversed
and the cause remanded for proper corrective proceedings
respecting the possession, control, and use of the property

in controversy, and for final judgment in conformity with
the opinion of the appellate court.*
On the twenty-first of February, 1868, the present appellants filed in the Chancery Court the mandate of the Court
of Appeals, together with a copy of the opinion of the appellate court, and moved that an order issue for the restitution of the property and for judgment in conformity with
the opinion of the court. Pending the consideration of that
motion the defeated party filed an original bill in equity
against the then appellants, praying that they be restrained
from all further prosecution of their motion for restitution
and from all proceedings, by action, suit, or otherwise, to
obtain possession or control of the property in controversy,
and the chancellor, instead of executing -the mandate of the
appellate court, granted the injunction prayed by the losing
party in the original case. Feeling aggrieved by that proceeding the then appellants applied to the Court of Appeals
for a rule to compel the chancellor to carry the mandate of
the appellate court into effect, and upon that hearing the
Court of Appeals decided that the chancellor had exceeded
his jurisdiction in granting the injunction prior to the entry
of their mandate, and rendering a final decree in conformity
therewith, and peremptorily required him to render a judgment of restitution of the property to the appellants, in so
far as they had been deprived thereof by his previous orders t
Those orders of the appellate court were not executed,
but the unsuccessful party immediately dismissed their bill
of complaint to enjoin the appellants from executing the decree of the Court of Appeals, and on the twenty-first of the
same month filed in the Circuit Court of the United States
the bill of complaint in this case, before the second mandate
of the appellate court commanding the chancellor to execute
the first mandate was filed in the subordinate court.
Beyond all question jurisdiction was assumed by the Circuit Court in this case by virtue of the fact that the parties
are citizens of different States, in which case the Judiciary
Act provides that the Circuit Courts shall have original cog* Watson et al. v. Avery et al., 2 Bush, 382.

nizance concurrent with the several States. Indeed, jurisdiction in the case is claimed solely upon the ground that
the Circuit Court of the United States possesses concurrentand co-ordinate jurisdiction with the State court in such a
controversy.
In view of these considerations, as more fully set forth in
the record and in the opinions given in this case by the
Court of Appeals, I am of the opinion that the Circuit Court
had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in controversy, as there were two courts of common law exercising
the same jurisdiction between the same parties in respect to
the same subject-matter, within the same territorial limits,
ahd governed by the same laws.
Neither court had any peculiar jurisdiction over the property in question nor of any peculiar right or lieu upon it
claimed by either party. Originally the State court had the
same power with the Circuit Court to hear and decide any
and every question that might arise as to the rights of property of either party in the course of ihe litigation. State
courts and Circuit Courts in sucl cases are courts of concurrent and co-ordinate jurisdiction, in respect to which the
principle is that "whenever property has been seized by an
officer of the court, or put in his-custody by the process of
the court, the property will be considered as in the custody
of the court and under its control for the time being,. and
that no other court has a right to interfere with that possession, unless it be some court which may have a direct supervisory control over the court whose process has first taken
possession, or some superior jurisdiction in the premises."*

THE MABEY.

[Sup. Or.

Statement of the case.

Remarks to show that the suit in the State court was pending and undisposed of when the bill was filed in the Circuit
Court are unnecessary, as the fact is admitted, and in view
of that fact I am of the opinion that the Circuit Court had
no jurisdiction of the case.
Being of the opinion that the case ought to be reversed
and dismissed for the want of jurisdiction, I do not think it
necessary or proper to express any opinion upon the merits
of the case.

THE MABEY.
A commission from this court to take testimony refused, on an appeal in a
collision case in admiralty, where the party moving had in the District
Court the same witnesses whom he proposed to examine here, and did
not examine them only because he had agreed with a co-defendant (who
was apparently as between themselves alone liable-he, the co-defendant, having led the other defendant into the fault for which the libel
had been filed,-) that he, the co-defendant, would manage the whole
case and pay the sums awarded by any decree (the purpose of this agreement having apparently been to keep from the court below a full knowledge of the case), and where especially the party now moving did not
appeal from the decree of the District Court.

ON motion, the owners of the Chapman had libelled in the
District Court at New York, the steamtug Mabey and the
sailing vessel Cooper, which the tug had been towing out to
sea, for injuries caused to the Chapman by collision on the
way out. The owners of both the tug and sailing vessel
appeared in the District Court with their witnesses, but the
owners of the tug soon withdrew from court, and gave no
evidence in defence of the tug. This course, it appeared,
had been done upon a written agreement between the owners
of the tug and sailing vessel, that the owner of the tug should
take no active part in the conduct of the suit; that no evidence should be offered in behalf of the tug, and that the
owners of the sailing vessel would assume the whole defence for both, and would pay whatever damages should be
awarded against either or both; for the performance of
