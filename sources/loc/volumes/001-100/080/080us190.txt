PENNSYLVANIA COLLEGE CASES.
The legislature of Pennsylvania chartered a college " at Canoniburg," by
the name of the Jefferson College, "in Canonsburg," giving to it a
constitution and declaring that the same should " be and remain the
inviolable constitution of the said college forever," and should not be
"altered or alterable by any ordinance or law of the said trustees
or in any other manner than by an act of the legislature" of Pennsylvania. The college becoming in need of funds put into operation a plan of endowment whereby in virtue of different specific
sums named, different sorts of scholarships were created; one, ex. gr., by
which on paying $400 a subscriber becume entitled to a perpetual
scholarship, capable of being sold or bequeathed; and another by which,
on payment of $1200, he became entitled to a perpetual scholarship entitling a student to tuition, room-rent, and boarding; this sort of scholarship being capable, by the terms of the subscription, of being disposed
of as other property. But nothing was specified in this plan as to where
this education, under the scholarships, was to be. On payment of the
different subscriptions, certificates were issued by the college, certifying
that A. B. had paid $---, which entitled him " to a scholarship as specified in the plan of endowment adopted by the trustees of Jefferson College, Canonsburg," &c. An act of legislature, in 1865, by consent of the
trustees of the college at Canonsburg and of the trustees of another college at Washington, Pennsylvania, seven miles from Canonsburg. created a new corporation, consolidating the two corporations, vesting the
funds of each in the new one, and in their separate form making them
to cease, but providing that all the several liabilities of each, including
the scholarships, should be assumed and discharged without diminution
or abatement by the new corporation. Notwithstanding the act of
Assembly, the collegiate buildings, &c., of Jefferson College were left at
Canonsburg, and certain parts of the collegiate course were still pursued
there; the residue being pursued at Washington College, Washington.
Subsequently, in 1869-the then existing Constitution of Pennsylvania
(one adopted in 1857, allowing the legislature of the State " to alter,
revoke, or annul any charter of incorporation thereafter granted, whenever in their opinion it may be injurious to the citizens, . . . in such

manner, however, that no injustice shall be done to the corporators")
being in force-a supplement to this act of 1865 was passed, 1 closely
uniting" the several departments of the new college created by the act
of 1865, and authorizing the trustees of it to locate them either at Canonsburg, Washington, or some other suitable place within the Commonwealth; they giving to whichever of the two towns named, had the
college taken away from it, or to both it it was taken away from both,
an academy, normal school, or other institution of a grade lower than
a college, with some property of the college for its use. Held, that the
legislature of Pennsylvania, by its act of 1869, had not passed any law
violating the obligation of a contract.
ERROR in three diffirent suits to the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania, there and here, argued and adjudged together;

the case being thus:

On the 15th of January, 1802, the legislature of Pennsylvania incorporated a college in the western part of Pennsylvania known as Jeffersou College. The title of the act
was, "An .act for the establishment of a college at Canonsburg, in the county of Washington, in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania."
The preamble set forth that "the establishment of a college at Canonsburg," &c., "for the instruction of youth in the
learned languages, in the arts and sciences, and in useful
literature, would tend to diffuse information and promote
the public good." The statute in its enacting part proceeded:
"SECTION 1. That there be erected and hereby is erected and
established in Canonsburg, &c., a college, &c., under the manage-

ment, direction, and government of a number of trustees, not
exceeding twenty-one," &c.
"SECTION 2. The said trustees and their successors shall forever hereafter be one body politic and corporate, with perpetual

succession in deed and in law, to all intents and purposes whatever, by the name, style, and title of ' The Trustees of Jefferson
College, in Canonsburg, in the county of Washington."'
There was given to the trustees the usual corporate powers, with all other powers, &c., usual in other colleges in the
United States.
Section 3d provided for meetings of the trustees, "at the

town of Canonsburg," for making by-laws and ordinances for
the government of the college, &c., principal and professors,
&c.
Section 5th provided for the succession in the trustees,
how misnomers in gifts or grants by deeds, or in devises or
bequests, should be treated; adding,
"And the constitution of the said college herein and hereby
declared and established, shall be and remain the inviolable constitution of the said collegeforever, and the same shall not be altered
or alterable by any ordinance or law of the said trustees, nor in
any other manner than by an act of the legislature of this Commonwealth."
In pursuance of this act the Jefferson College was established. Several buildings for a college were erected. The
State made donations to the institution from time to time,
and from these or other sources a library, as also a chemical and astronomical apparatus, was brought together.
In the year 1806, the same legislature incorporated another college, establishing it at the town of Washington,
just seven miles from Canonsburg, where the former college
had been established. Thus, although in the faculties of
both colleges there have been from time to time professors
of eminent ability and learning, and though from both colleges have come men who have done honor to the institutions in which they were reared, it yet came to pass-with
the multiplicity of colleges throughout the State-that these
two, so near to each other, slenderly endowed, and in a part
of Pennsylvania until quite late times neither rich nor populous, never thrived; on the contrary, rather labored with
existence. Accordingly, in 1853, the trustees of Jefferson
College put into operation a plan of endowment whereby on
the payment of $25 the subscriber to the plan became entitled to a single scholarship; on the payment of $50 to a
family scholarship; on the payment of $100 to tuition for
thirty years; on the payment of $400 to a perpetual scholarship, to be designated by whatever name the subscriber
might select; it being provided that such a scholarship
might be disposed of by sale or devised by will as any other

property; by the payment of $1200 to a scholarship in full,
entitling the holder to the tuition, room-rent, and boarding
of one student in perpetuity; it being provided that such a
scholarship might be disposed of as any other property.
But in this "Plan of Endowment," as the paper proposing it
was called, nothing was said of education at Canonsburg
specifically, though it was declared that when $60,000 were
subscribed "the trustees of the college should issue certificates guaranteeing to the subscribers the privileges above
enumerated." Of these various scholarships upwards of
1500 were sold. To each of the subscribers to this plan of
endowment a certificate in this form was issued under the
seal of the corporation:

But this scheme did not prove an entirely wise one; for
though it procured a certain amount of money for an endowment fund, it brought upon the college a large body of students to be educated at rates entirely too low, and the college
was deprived of its former resources of tuition fees; always
very small, but still much greater than the interest on the
sum which now entitled a student, and even a whole family
of students, to be educated, without paying anything. Thus
it was with the Jefferson CollegQ, at Canonsburg. The other
college, at Washington, adopted apparently some similar

scheme and flourished no more than the Jefferson. Both
colleges during the rebellion fell into a condition of debility
undesirable for seats of learning.*
In this state of things, there having been a proposition to
make a union of the colleges, a convention of the alumni of
both was held at Pittsburg, September 27th, 1864, and the
members of this convention having "discussed in a candid
and fraternal spirit the proposed union of the colleges
passed a series of resolutions, of which this was the first:
"That we see the hand of Providence pointing to the union
of the two ancient colleges, whose sons we are, and fixing the
present as the time for the happy consummation by such evident
facts as these: The great and constantly increasing number of
literar y instinutions in the land; the urgent need in Western
Pennsylvania of an eminently influential and richly endowed
college; the desire fbr a union of Jefferson and Washington,
so generally entertained, and so frequently and earnestly expressed; the proximity of the said colleges, soon to be made
more apparent by the completion of a connecting railway; the
very unsatisfactory condition of their antiquated buildings; the
reduced number of students, partly the result of our national
troubles; the inadequacy of the old salaries to meet the demands of the times and afford the professors a competent support; the difficulty of obtaining aid for either institution in its
separate existence; the several offers made by liberal and reliable men to furnish large amounts of funds in case a union is
effected, and depending also upon that event; the probable donation by our legislature of a valuable grant of lands given by
Congress to the State for the advancement of agricultural
knowledge."
The convention then went on and recommended a plan of

aided by contingent, matriculation, and diploma fees, amounting together
to about $1111 per annum, composed the resources of Jefferson College, the
scholarships issued by it having cut off the revenue from tuition. The
annual expenditures of the institution were in excess of its income, although
the cash salary of the president was only $1200 and the highest salary paid
to a professor was $800.

union for the two colleges and the procuring of appropriate
legislation to effect the consolidation.

The matter in its general aspect was assented to by the
boards of trustees of the respective colleges, and in the following year, March 4th, 1865, an act was passed by the
legislature of Pennsylvania to carry out a union.
The title of the act was, "An act to unite the colleges of
Jefferson and Washington, in the county of Washington,
and to erect the same into'one corporation, under the name
of Washington and Jefferson College."
Its preamble recites that "the trustees of those colleges
(Jefferson and Washington) have agreed upon a union thereof,
and have besought this General Assembly to give thereto the
sanction and aid of a legislative enactment."
Section 1 united the two colleges into one corporation
by the name aforesaid.
Section 2 vested all the property and funds of each in the
new corporation, "and all the several liabilities of said two
colleges or corporations, by either of them suffered or created, including the scholarships heretofore granted by, and now
obligatory upon each of them, are hereby imposed upon and declared to be assumed by the corporation hereby created, which shall
discharge and perform the same without diminution or abatement."
Section 3 declared the objects of the corporation and provided how the trustees were to be selected and continued,
and prescribed their powers and duties.
Section 10 directed that there should be four periods or
classes of study, denominated the freshman, sophomore junior, and senior classes.
Section 11 created two additional departments of study,
the scientific and preparatory; the first to qualify students
for business avocations, the second for admission to the first,
or to the freshman class of the college.
Section 12 provided prospectively for an agricultural department.
Section 13 declared "that the studies of the senior, junior,
and sophomore classes shall be pursued at or near Canonsburg, in the county of Washington, and those of the fresh-

man class and of the preparatory, scientific, and agricultural
departments at or near Washington, in said county," and
provided how the income of endowment funds should be
apportioned, &c.
Section 14 committed the instruction and government of
the three higher classes named, to the president and professors of those classes, and the instruction and government
of the freshman class and the departments, to the vicepresident and professors, or inst'uctors of their appropriate
studies, &c.
Section 18 enacted:
"That from and after the organizati-o of the corporatiou
hereby created, as herein provided, the colleges of Jefferson and
Washington, named in the first section of the act, shall be dissolved, except so far as may be found necessary to enable them
to close up their business affairs and to perfect the transfer of
their property and rights to the corporation by this act created.'"
When this new act was passed (A.D. 1865), the then
existing or amended constitution of Pennsylvania,* adopted
in 1857, was inforce. That constitution provided that:
" The legislature shall have power to alter, revoke, or annul
any charter of incorporation hereafter conferred by or under any
special or general law, whenever, in their opinio,, it may be injurious to the citizens of the Commonwealth ; in such manner,
however, that no injustice shall be done to the corporators."
Under the act of Assembly of 1865, a new state of things
as prescribed by it was set in operation. But the good
effects anticipated from a union on this plan did not come.
The new college did not thrive. And in 1868 another convention of alumni was held, in which various resolutions
were passed, among them one expressing " the conviction
of the convention that a complete consolidation of the two departments should be immediately effected, so as to have
them occupy buildings situated in the same place." And in
consequence of this the board of trustees of the college,

through a series of committees, took the matter into consideration, the result of the whole being the recommendation
of further legislation, in the direction pointed out by the convention of the alumni.
A supplement" to the act of March 4th, 1865, was then,
February 26th, 1869, passed. Section 1st enacted "that as
soon as the necessary preliminary arrangements could be
made and suitable buildings provided, the several departments
of Washington and Jefferson College should be closely
united, and located either at Canonsburg, Washington, or
some other suitable place witdn this commonwealtl, to be fixed
by the vote of not less than two-thirds of the trustees," &c.
Section 5 provided for an ""academy, normal school, or
other institution of lower grade than a college," to be given
by the trustees to the unsuccessful one of the two places
named, or to both, if the college is taken "elsewhere," with
some real or personal property of the college for the use of
such academy, &c.
Section 6 made it " lawful for any incorporated college or
institution of learning, within this commonwealth, to unite
with Washington and Jefferson College, and consolidate
their property and funds for educational purposes, on such
terms and conditions as may be agreed upon."
With the exception that this act obliged the college to be
fixed somewhere in the State of Pennsylvania, it followed
the exact language of a draft which had been prepared by
the committee of the board of trustees of the college, and
reportel to it as advisable. This draft had been approved
without dissent by the board, twenty-five members out of
thirty-one composing it being present at the meeting; and a
committee had been appointed by it to visit Harrisburg and
procure its enactment.
After the supplement was obtained it was accepted by the
board, and the whole college fixed at Washington, with
more effective means of education, including an endowment
of $50,000, made by people of that place on condition that
the whole college should be so fixed.

one hundred and eight others asked to become, and were
admitted, co-plaintiffs), holders of the scholarship certificates,
issued as already mentioned by the trustees of Jefferson College, in 1853, filed a bill in equity, in the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania, against the two corporations, wherein they set
foirth the incorporation of Jefferson College at Canonsburg,
the buildings it had erected, and the gifts and endowments
which it had received and possessed; that in 1853, the trustees of the college devised and put in operation the plan of
endowment already mentioned, and evidenced by certificates
of scholarship, issued by them, under the corporate seal,
&c.; whereby, tuition, &c., in said college, was granted to
the holders, they paying into the corporate treasury therefor
various sums of money, according to the grade or quantity
of the scholarship, specifying it all as already stated on page
192; that one thousand five hundred of these certificates
were issued, of which one thousand two hundred were yet
outstanding; that the complainants, " residents of Canonsburg and its vicinity, relying upon the good faith of the said
trustees, and the perpetuity of said college at Canonsburg,
bought and still held such certificates of scholarships, believing that thereby they could have their sons or descendants educated at said college, in Canonsburg, without the
expense and risk of sending them from home;" that on
March 4th, 1865, the legislature of Pennsylvania passed the
act already mentioned as of that date (reciting it), and on
the 26th of February, 1869, " a supplement" to the said act
of 1865 (reciting the supplement); that the trustees of Jefferson College in Canonsburg, &c., had accepted the said act
of 1865, and had joined in uniting said two colleges, and had
removed the freshmen class and the preparatory and scientific departments from Canonsburg to Washington, seven
miles distant; and that the trustees .of the college called
"Washington and Jefferson College," formed under the act
of 1865, were about to remove the college library, apparatus,
classes, and professors from Canonsburg to Washington, and
to dispose of the college buildings, &c., at Callonsburg, so
as to deprive the plaintiffs of the tuition, &c., agreed to be

there given to them; and that the defendants justified the
proposed action, under the supplement of 1869; that the said
scholarship certificates constituted subsisting contracts between the Complainants and the trustees of Jefferson College, in Canonsburg, &c., entitling them to have the granted
tuition, &c., at that place, in the college there; and that if
said acts of 1865 and 1869 were to have effect, they would
be irreparably injured, and the contracts impaired; that said
acts of 1865 and 1869 were invalid and unconstitutional,
because impairing the obligations of subsisting contracts;
and therefore repugnant to the 10th section of the first article
of the Constitution of the United States, which declares that
no State shall pass any law "impairing the obligation of
contracts."
The prayer of the bill accordingly was:
1. That said acts of 1865 and 1869 be declared null and
void, as repugnant to the said prohibitions, in that they
undertook to change the location of the said college, its
classes, buildings, and property, from Canonsburg to Washington, or elsewhere.
2. For injunction against making such change or removal.
The case came up on bill and answer. There was no dispute about facts. The question was the validity of the
"supplemental " act of 1869; the question, namely, whether
the contract of scholarships between the complainants and
others and Jefferson College, did not interpose. a constitutional barrier to any legislative grant of authority to the
trustees of the college to surrender its former charter and
accept a new one, by which the college was eventually removed from Canonsburg to Washington, in the same county.
At the same time was filed in the same court another bill;
one by "the trustees of Jefferson College in Canonsburg, in the
county of Washington" (the old corporation of 1802), against
"Washington and Jefferson College" (the corporation of
1865), setting out their old charter of 1802, gifts and donations to carry it out, and specially $5000 given, bequeathed
by benevolent persons to the complainants as a permanent
fund, to be kept separate from other funds, for educating

poor and pious young men; the scholarships, &c., all, much
as in the preceding case.
There was also filed a third bill by five persons, "members of the boards of trustees of Washington and Jefferson."
Their complaint being more especially of the supplement of
1869, and of its impairing the obligation of the contracts
raised by the act of 1865. All three bills originated apparently in one view, and had apparently one purpose, the different forms of effort being resorted to, the one in aid of the
other; and so that if one form of proceeding was found open
to fatal objection, one or both of the others might be resorted to with better prospect of success.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, after a full consideration of the case (Thompson, C. J., delivering itsjudgment),
dismissed all the bills, holding in effect:
1st. That the legislation complained of did not, in point
of fact, infringe the said contracts.
2d. That even if the contracts were so affected by the
legislation, yet their obligation could not be said to be impaired in a legal sense, because the acceptance of the legislation by the trustees of Jefferson College concluded the
complainants; and, also, 3d, because the acts of Assembly
in question were passed by the legislature of Pennsylvania,
in the exercise of a power so to do, reserved (as to the act
of 1865) in the original charter of Jefferson College and (as
to the act of 1869) given by the amended constitution of
Peunylvania.

PENNSYLVANIA COLLEGE CASES.
Argument for the holders of the scholarships.

By clear and necessary implication arising from the whole
transaction, and visible in the certificate given in the matter,
Canonsburg is recognized as the place where the education
was to be given. The title of the original act is, "An act
for the establishment of a college at Canonsburg." The
preamble recited that "the establishment of a college at Canonsburg would promote the public good." "The trustees
and their successors, it is enacted, shall forever thereafter be
one body politic and corporate, with perpetual succession,
by the name of ' The Trustees of Jefferson College, in Canonsburg.'" Pursuant to this charter an institution had been
established and had flourished for half a century, when the
trustees devised a plan of endowment, and induced the complainants to become contributors thereto by the purchase of
scholarships.
Of the 1500 scholarships sold, several hundred were bought
and are held by residents of Canonsburg. All the 114 complainants are of this class. What did the contributors expect
at the time the contracts were made? What did the trustees
cnaow that they expected? And what did the trustees themselves intend? What, in short, did all parties mean? Certainly to get the tuition from Jefferson College, at Canonsburg; from that college, permanently fixed there. A college
is not an ambulatory institution, but a stationary one.
It is unimportant that the place of performance may have
been but implied. Implied contracts are as much within the
protection of the Constitution as express ones.
Now the place of performance in such contracts as contracts for education at a particular place is an essential part
of the contract. In this case the subscriptions were largely
by the people of Canonsburg, who wished to have their sons
instructed without the cost and without that exposure to
perils which come from sending them away from home.
When you compel them to send their sons away the contract
is worthless.

Argument for the holders of the scholarships.

New York, Genesee College had been incorporated in 1849,
and buildings erected at Lima, Livingston County, New
York; scholarships were issued by the institution, and subscribed and paid for by the plaintiffs; subsequently, under
an offlr of $200,000 from the Conference of the Methodist
Church, at Syracuse, New York, the trustees of the college
resolved to abandon Linia and remove the college to Syracuse, and applied for an act of Assembly to authorize the
removal. At that juncture a bill was filed by some of the
scholarship holders, and an injunction asked for and obtained, restraining the defendants from the removal of the
college. The ground upon which the injunction was put
was, that in the case of a scholarship issued by a college
having an established location, the place where the tuition is to
be gecen is an essential part of the contract. Says Johnson, J.,
in his opinion granting the injunction:
"It is plain that neither party had any other place in contemplation, and that must of necessity have been the place
agreed upon, as definitely and certainly as though it had been
specified in the most exact and unequivocal terms in the certificate. The place of performance, in this as in all other contracts,
is a material part of such contract, and the obligation can neither
be satisfied nor discharged by tender of performanceat anotherplace."
Suppose the trustees of Jefferson College, without having
procured any legislative authority, had refused to furnish
tuition at Canonsburg to the holders of scholarships, but
had tendered performance in Massachusetts, Louisiana, or
California, would not such conduct have been a breach of
their contract? If so, is not the same conduct, when done
under guise of legislative authority, equally a breach of contract, if so be that the legislature have no valid power to
authorize such a departure from the obvious intent of the
contract ?
Then, are the holders of the scholarship contracts in any
way estopped because of the act of the trustees of Jefferson
College in accepting the act of 1865 ?
The parties to the contract in question are the trustees of

Jefferson College (the grantors), and the subscribers to the
plan of endowment (the grantees named in the several scholarships). Now it is a strange state of the law, if one of the
said parties, the trustees, can, by a voluntary dissolutionone not brought about by legal proceedings to forfeit for
some abuse, but brought about by their own act of procuring
and accepting an act of Assembly dissolving the corporationescape from the obligations of their contracts.
Admitting the general rule to be that a private corporation may surrender its franchises, yet it cannot be successfully
invoked by the defendants, because the trustees of Jefferson
College were mere trustees, and not owners of the college
fund; their powers extended to its preservation and proper
application, but not to consenting to its withdrawal from the
existing beneficiaries. This corporation is an eleemosynary
one; and the difference between. this class of corporations
and corporations for gain is obvious and well settled. The
latter to a large degree may do what they please. They
have no interests to consult but those of their corporators.
Those interests will prevent their abusing their trusts. But
eleemosynary corporations are trustees of a sacred trust.
For the most part they are.managing the property of the departed. They are bound to respect in the highest degree the
objects and directions declared by their founders and benefactors. They cannot surrender their franchises at pleasure.
The case of State v. Adams* is in point. By the charter
of" St. Charles College," it was required to be " an. institution purely literary, affording instruction in ancient and
modern languages, the sciences and liberal arts, and not
including or supporting by its funds any department for
instruction in systematic or polemic theology." An amendment of the charter, approved February 6th, 1847, provided
that " the concurrence of the Missouri Annual Conference of
the Methodist Episcopal Church South," should be requisite
in filling all vacancies in the board. .Held, that the amendment, by requiring the concurrence in the choice of curators,

of an ecclesiastical body representing one of the religious
denominations of the State, endangered, in this regard, the
principles of the fbundation; and, even if it did not, it
changed the character of the administration of the trust,
hindered the free choice of their successors, according to the
will of the founder, by the men to whom he had intrusted
his bounty, and essentially impaired the contract upon which
he advanced it. Held, further, that the curators, or trustees,
of an eleemosynary institution have no power over the charter, but on the contrary it is their creator and their absolute
rule of conduct; that the beneficial interest in the college
fund belongs neither to them nor the State, but to the beneficiaries only, who, from the nature of the case, cannot consent to any changes in the charter; that hence its essential
conditions are permanent, so far as change depends upon consent,
and the acceptanceof a legislative amendment to the charter of such
an institution by the board of curators gives it no validity.
The inability to make any improper legislative change is
recognized also in Allen v. McKeen. *
Indeed the provision in the 5th section of the original
charter of Jefferson College, that the constitution of the college shall be and remain the inviolable constitution of the
said college forever, and he same shall not "be altered or
alterable by any ordinance or law of the said trustees," disabled the trustees from assisting in the destruction of the
subject of their trust.
Admitting then, as we think it must be admitted, that the
proposed changes in name, character, and location of the college, disregard what was meant to be the contract, and that
the consent of the board of trustees to the act of 1865 cannot
validate it, can that act be sustained as a valid exercise by the
legislature of the powers reserved in the 5th section of the
original charter of 1802, declaring that the constitution of
the college " shall not be altered" in any other manner than
by an act of the legislature of this Commonwealth.
1. The provision does not confer upon or reserve to the

legislature the power to revoke and resume the franchises
granted by the act of 1802, and to confer them and the property acquired under them upon a new and different corporation. A power to alter the constitution of the college is not
a power to revoke and destroy it. A right to alter is consistent
with the perpetual existence of the college.* Such a provision is only intended to fneet those altered conditions of
society and pursuits whereby a strict adherence to all the
formal requirements of a foundation might defeat its object.
2. But, conceding that the reserved power to alter is
equivalent to a power to revoke, and that a power to modify
is the same thing with a power to terminate and destroy,
and that the exercise of such a reserved power might be
valid, as between the college and the State, still it is invalid
and unconstitutional so far as third parties holding contracts
affected by it, are concerned. It is apparent, upon the face
of the contracts held by the complainants, that they did not
contemplate the contingency of a legislative subversion of
their obligation. It may be said indeed holders were bound
to know that the legislature might exercise its reserved
power; but this is a begging of the question. It is true,
they were bound to know the reserved power of the legislature; but they also had knowledge of the limits of legislative
power, and the restraints imposed by the Constitution of the
United States for the guarantee and protection of contracts,
and that the obligation of contracts were sacred and beyond
the reach of legislative action.
In Oldtown and Lincoln Railroad Company v. Veazie,t the
charter required that not less than eleven thousand shares
should be subscribed before the subscription could be enforced by calls. The defendant subscribed for one thousand
shares. Only nine thousand five hundred shares were subscribed in all. A supplemental act was then passed, reducing
the limits to eight thousand shares. It was held that the re* Allen v. McKeen, supra,p. 204; Sage v. Dillard, 15 Ben. Monroe, 340.

served power to amend the charter did not authorize a change

-Blessrs.J. A. Wills and J. S. Black, contra:
The people of Canonsburg are the real complainants here;
and three suits instead of one, it is understood by all, have
been brought only that the chances of success may be increased by an adoption of various forms of presenting the
case. Waiving technical matters-such as the obvious and
conclusive one in the second suit, that there is now no such
corporation as the old Jefibrson College at Canonsburg, and
therefore no such complainant in existence as sues in that
case-we go at once to merits. All the cases alike present
as their strongest feature-and their only feature-with even
apparent strength the arrangement about the scholarships.
They all set up a contract, and the obligation of it impaired.
There is no other case.
Now the case is in equity; the parties ask for that which is
conscionable. Such parties must have a good case in conscience themselves. But oi what do they stand as their very
best ground? On certain alleged contracts (of which they
have had the benefit since 1853), whereby four years of illstruction, including that of the preparatory department, at a
respectable college is demanded for the annual interest of $50,
say $3 a year; afamiy scholarship, for an indefinite number
of boys, for four or five years each, for the interest of $100,
say $6 a year; a perpetual scholarship, for the interest of
$400, say $24 a year; a scholarship in full, entitling the
holder to the tuition, room-rent, and boardi'ng of one student in perpetuity, for the interest of $1200, say $72 a year.
In point of fact, as must be obvious to all, this plan of endowment was really expected by the college to bring to it
that which should be gifts. Au apparent equivalent was
professed to be returne(l as a graceful mode of asking, and
that the college might not appear a mendicant. Certainly
the trustees never expected that-unless exceptionally, and
in cases where gratuitous education would in any event have
been given-the contributors to the plan would avail them-

selves rigorously of their part of the matter.

It is only the

complainants-people of Canonsburg-who have done so.
No college could exist on such a scheme actually enforced,
as this plan set forth. It is the inequitable exaction by people
like the complainants-people of Canonsburg-of what they
call their rights under these scholarships-that Jefferson
College was reduced to a condition that, in order to live at
all, it had to seek union with a stronger one. The case
then, to begin with, is defective in equity. And on a bill
to cancel all the scholarships, a chancellor no doubt, on
return of the money and interest, would give the college
relief.
But if the case had full equity, how does the case stand?
There are here said to be many scholaiships outstanding.
But the rights would be the same had only a single one been
created. Yet can it be that a college by making a single
contract of such a kind, puts it beyond both the power of
the legislature and of itself, to do that which both may deem
vital to the existence of the college, or even to give effect to
the contract itself in any form? For the question may be
often-as it actually was in regard to Jefferson College-a
question between utter extinction and a changed form of
existence.
The general right of a private corporation to surrender
its franchises must be admitted. There may be some distinctions as respects eleemosynary corporations, but in cases
where both corporation and State, that is to say, where
grantor and grantee alike consent, the general rule can be
qualified only by some plain injury to private right, in the
face of what either State or corporation was bound to do.
Now here the charter of 1802 is "alterable," and may, be
"altered" by the legislature. The power is given in a form
elliptical indeed, but abundantly plain. Admit that a.power
to alter is not a power to destroy, still has there been any
destroying here? There is nothing either in the plan of
endowment or in the certificate which makes it obligatory
to give the promised education at Canonsburg.. There is no
"contract" that it shall be there. Nor. can any one affirm

even that the trustees intended or the contributors, many
of whom did not live at Canonsburg, expected that it should
always be there. Here were two colleges, put in very early
times, in small towns of Western Pennsylvania, within seven
miles of each other; with colleges all about the State. Little
sagacity is required to see that such doings could have been
the fruit of nothing but of temporary village rivalries. From
the days of their foundation both colleges languished, and
from a short term after those days the court may well believe, what many in that region well know, that a union was
contemplated. It has been contemplated these fifty years
and more. The difficulty has been how to overcome the local
interests, and how to dispose of the supernumerary president
and professors. In view of all this-so easily to be apprehended by the court, and so well known to opposing counsel-it cannot be affirmed that it was certainly even so
much as expected by all that the education was to be forever
at Canonsburg. And the absence from the plan of endowment and the certificates given under it of any provision that
it should be there, raises a probability that the matter of
union was in the minds of both parties concerned. But be
that as it may, an expectation is not of necessity a contract, nor the disappointment of one, an infringement of
the Constitution. The only contract then is for education,
&e. The whole of that contract is "imposed" and "assumed," "without diminution or abatement" on, and by the
new college created in 1865; saved, therefore, in perfection
and identity. What, therefore, the act of 1865 did was not
a destruction of the right, but a change "intended to meet
those altered conditions of society and pursuits, whereby a
strict adherence to all the formal requirements of a foundation might defeat its object," the exact case in which opposing counsel admit that a change in the charter is an alteration
and not a destruction. Such control over corporations has
always been exercised in Pennsylvania, where there is no
court or chancery, by the legislature as parens patrice.
The case of Daily v. The Genesee College seems to have
been a question between the holders of scholarships and the

trustees acting without legislative authority. And The State
v. Adams goes no further than to say that the trustees of a
college, even with the sanction of the State, cannot consent
to an amendment of the charter of a college, the effect of
which is fundamentally to change the objects, purposes, and
administration of the trust. To such a doctrine we agree.
The case is thus disposed of. It may be added that the
holders of the scholarships do not appear to have made any
objection to the act of 1865. With that act they were apparently satisfied. If they were, then the surrender of the
charter of Jefferson College, and the acceptance of the new
one, was with the assent, in point of fact, of the trustees, the
legislature, and the holders of scholarships; in other words,
with an assent of every interest in the college. All came
voluntarily 'into the new corporation; a corporation over
which by the amended constitution of 1857, the legislature
bad from the hour of its creation a very large control. The
holders of the scholarships are not corporators. Independently of which no injustice has been done them. On the
contrary, they may get a good education at Washington,
instead of getting no education anywhere. For Jefferson
College, Canonsburg, was in the article of death, when a
new and higher existence was given to it.
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Jefferson College was incorporated on the fifteenth of
January, 1802, by the name of the Trustees of Jefferson
College in Canonsburg in the county of Washington, for
the education of youth in the learned languages and the
arts, sciences, and useful literature. By the charter it was
declared that the trustees should be a body politic and corporate, with perpetual succession, in deed and in law, to all
intents and purposes whatsoever, and that the constitution
of the college "shall not be altered or alterable by any
ordinance or law of the said trustees, nor in any other
manner than by an act of the legislature of the Commonwealth."

eighth of March, 1806, by the name of The Trustees of
"Washingtou College for the education of youth in the
learned and foreign languages, the useful arts, sciences, and
literature, and was located in the town of Washington,
seven miles distant from Jefferson College, in the same
county.
Experience showed in the progress of events that the
interests of both institutions would be promoted in their
union, and the friends of both united in a common effort to
effect that object. Application was accordingly made to the
legislature for that purpose, and on the fourth of March,
1865, the legislature passed the "Act to unite the colleges
of Jefferson and Washington, in the county of Washington,
and to erect the same into one corporation under the name
of Washington and Jefferson College." Enough is stated
in the preamble of the act to show that the application was
made to promote the best interests of both institutions, and
that the legislative act which is the subject of complaint was
passed at their united request and to sanction the union
which their respective trustees had previously agreed to
establish. Inconveniences resulted I'fom the provisions contained in the thirteenth section of the act, which impliedly
forbid any change in the sites of the respective colleges, and
also provided that the studies of certain classes of the students should be pursued at each of the two institutions, and
to that end prescribed certain rules for appropriating to each
certain portions of the income derived from the funds of
the institution, and the manner in which the same should
be expended and applied by the trustees. Such embarrassments increasing, the legislature passed a supplementary
act, providing that the several departments of the two colleges should be closely united, and that the united institution should be located as therein prescribed. Measures
were also prescribed in the same act for determining the
location of the united institution, and it appears that those
measures, when carried into effect, resulted in fixing the location at Washington, in the county of the same name. Certain parties are dissatisfied with the new arrangement, and

it appears that, on the twenty-fourth of August, 1869, three
bills in equity were filed in the State court, praying that the
last-named act of the legislature may be declared null and
void as repugnant to the ninth article of the constitution of
the State, and to the tenth section of the first article of the
Federal Constitution. Different parties complain in each
of the several cases, but the subject-matter of the complaint
involves substantially the same considerations in all the
cases. Those complaining in the first case are the trustees
of Jefferson College. Complainants in the second case are
certain members of the board of trustees of Washington and
Jefferson College, who oppose the provisions of the act of
the twenty-sixth of February, 1869, and deny that the board
of trustees, even by a vote of two-thirds of the members, as
therein required, can properly remove the college or dispose
of the college buildings as therein contemplated. Objections
are made by the complainants in the last case to both the
before-mentioned acts of the legislature, and they claim the
right to ask the interposition of the court, upon the ground
that they are owners of certain scholarships in Jefferson
College, as more fully set forth in the bill of complainant,
and they pray that both of the said acts of Assembly may be
declared null and void for the same reasons as those set
forth in the other two cases.
I. Examination of these cases will be made in the order
they appear on the calendar, commencing with the case in
which the trustees of Jefferson College are the complainants.
They bring their bill of complaint against the two colleges
,-s united, under the first act of Assembly passed for that
purpose. Service was made and the respondents appeared
and pleaded in bar that the complainants, as such trustees,
duly accepted the act of Assembly creating the union of the
two institutions, and that having accepted the same they, as
a corporation, became dissolved and ceased to exist, and
have no authority to maintain their bill of complaint.
Apart from the plea in bar they also filed an answer, but as
the whole issue is presented inthe plea in bar it will not be
necessary to enter into those details. Oppo.sed to that plea

is the replication of the complainants, in which they deny
the allegation that they, as a corporation, became dissolved
or that they ceased to exist as alleged in the plea in bar, and
renew their prayer for relief. Both parties were heard, and
the Supreme Court of the State entered a decree for the
respondents, dismissing the bill of complaint. - Decrees for
the respondents were also entered in the other two cases, and
the respective complainants sued out writs of error under
the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, and removed the
respective causes into this court for re-examination.
Whether the act of Assembly in question in this case is or
not repugnant to the constitution of the State is conclusively
settled against the complainants by the decision in this very
case, and the question is not one open to re-examination in
this court, as it is not one of Federal cognizance in t case
brought here by a writ of error to a State court. Nothing,
therefore, remains to be examined but the second question
presented in the pleadings, which is, whether the supplementary act of Assembly uniting the two institutions and
providing that there should be but one location of the same
for any purpose, impairs the obligation of the contract between the State and the corporation of Jefferson College, as
created by the original charter; or, in other words, whether
it is repugnant to the tenth section of the first article of the
Federal Constitution.
Corporate franchises granted to private corporations, if
duly accepted by the corporators, partake of the nature of
legal estates, as the grant under such circumstances becomes
a contract within the protection of that clause of the Constitution which ordains that no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.* Charters of private
corporations are regarded as executed contracts between the
government and the corporators, and the rule is well settled
that the legislature cannot repeal, impair, or alter such a

charter against the consent or without the default of the
corporation judicially ascertained and declared.* Of course
these remarks apply only to acts of incorporation which do
not contain any reservations or provisions annexing conditions to the charter modifying and limiting the nature of
the contract. Cases. often arise where the legislature, in
granting an act of incorporation for a private purpose, either
make the duration of the charter conditional or reserve to
the State the power to alter, modify, or repeal the same at
pleasure. Where such a provision is incorporated in the
charter it is clear that it qualifies the grant, and that the
subsequent exercise of that reserved power cannot be regarded as an act within the prohibition of the Constitution.
Such a power also, that is the power to alter, modify, or
repeal an act of incorporation, is frequently reserved to the
State by a general law applicable to all acts of incorporation,
or to certain classes of the same, as the case may be, in
which case it is equally clear that the power mfy be exercised
whenever it appears that the act of incorpbration is one
which falls within the reservation and that the charter was
granted subsequent to the passage of the general law, even
though the charter contains no such condition nor any allusion to such a reservation.t. Reservations in such a charter,
it is admitted, may be made, and it is also conceded that
where they exist the exercise of the power reserved by a
subsequent legislature does not impair the obligation of the
contract created by the original act of incorporation. Subsequent legislation altering or modifyiiig the provisions of
such a charter, where there is no such reservation, is certainly unauthorized if it is prejudicial to the rights of the
corporators, and was passed without their assent, but the
converse of the proposition is also true, that if the new provisions altering and modifying the charter were passed with
the assent of the corporation and they were duly accepted

by a corporate vote as amendments to the original charter,
they cannot be regarded as impairing the obligation of the
contract created by the original charter.* Private charters
or such as are granted for the private benefit of the corporators are held to be contracts because they are based for
their consideration on the liabilities and duties which the
corporators assume by accepting the terms therein specified,
and the grant of the franchise on that account can no more
be resumed by the legislature or its benefits diminished or
impaired without the assent of the corporators than any
other grant of property or legal estate, unless the right to
do so is reserved in the act of incorporatiou or in some general law of the State which was in operation at the time the
charter was granted.t
Apply those principles to the case under consideration
and it is quite clear that the decision of the State court was
correct, as the fifth section of the charter, by necessary implication, reseies to the State the power to alter, modify,
or amend the charter without any prescribed limitation.
Provision is there made that the constitution of the college
shall not be altered or alterable by any ordinance or law of
the trustees, " nor in any other manner than by an act of
the legislature of the Commonwealth," which is in all respects equivalent to an express reservation to the State to
make any alterations in the charter which the legislature in
its wisdom may deem fit, just, and expedient to enact, and
the donors of the institution are as much bound by that provision as the trustees.t

PENNSYLVANIA COLLEGE CASES.
Opinion of the court.

Suppose, however, the fact were otherwise, still the respondents must prevail, as it is admitted that the complainants accepted the act passed to unite the two colleges and to
erect the same into one corporation, which supports to every
intent the respondents' plea in bar and utterly disproves
the allegations of the complainants' replication denying
that the complainant corporation was dissolved before their
bill of complaint was filed. Doubts have often been expressed whether a private corporation can be dissolved by
the surrender of its corporate franchise into the hands of the
government, but the question presented in this case is not
of that character, as the act of the legislature uniting the
two colleges did not contemplate that either college as an
institution of learning should cease to exist, or that the funds
of either should be devoted to any other use than that described in the original charters. All that was contemplated
by the act in question was that the two institutions should
be united in one corporation, as. requested by the friends
and patrons of both, that they might secure greater patronage and be able to extend their usefulness and carry out
more effectually the great end and aim of their creation.
Authorized as the act of the legislature was by the reservation contained in the original charter, and sanctioned as the
act was by having been adopted by the corporators, it is
clear to a demonstration that the act uniting the two colleges
was a valid act, and that the two original corporations became merged in the one corporation created by the amendatory and enabling act passed for that purpose, and that
neither of the original corporations is competent to sue for
any cause of action subsequent in date to their acceptance
of the new act of incorporation.*
I. Sufficient has already been remarked to show that the
case of the dissenting trustees of the new corporation, which
is the second case, is governed by the same principles as the
preceding case. They admit that the act of the legislature

PENNSYLVANIA COLLEGE CASES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

uniting the two colleges in one corporation was duly accepted by the original corporators, and they also admit in
effect that it is a valid law. Express provision was therein
made that the two colleges should be united in one corporation by the name of Washington and Jefferson College, and
that the new corporation should possess and enjoy all the
capacities, powers, privileges, immunities, and franchises
which were possessed and enjoyed by the original institutions and the trustees thereof, "with such enlargements and
subject to such changes therein as are made by this act."
Accepted as that act was by the trustees of the original institutions, they not only ratified the reservation contained
in the fifth section of the charter of Jefferson College, but
they in express terms adopted the changes made in the
amended charter uniting the two institutions in one corporation.
Viewed in the light of these suggestions the present case
stands just as it would if the reservation contained in the
original charter had been in terms incorporated into the new
charter uniting the two institutions into one corporation,
which the complainants in this case admit is a valid act of
the legislature. Such an admission, however, is not necessary to establish that fact, as the act was passed by the assent
of the two corporations and in pursuance of the reserved
power to that effect contained in the original charter of the
corporation to which the complaining corporators in the
preceding case belonged. Grant that the power existed in
the legislature to pass the act uniting the two institutions
and it follows that the supplementary act which was passed
to render the first act practically available is also a rightful
exercise of legislative authority, as it is clear that substantially the same reservation is contained in the act providing
for the union of the two institutions as that contained in the
original charter by virtue of which the act was passed uniting the two institutions in one corporation.* Tested by
these considerations the court here is of the opinion that

Opinion of the court. 1

the decision of the State court in the second case is also
correct.
IT. Plans of various kinds were devised by the trustees
of Jefferson College and put in operation for the endowment
of the institution; and, among others, was the plan of estabhshing what was called the scholarships, whereby a contributor on payment of twenty-five dollars became entitled to
tuition for one person for a prescribed period, called a right
to a single scholarship; or, on payment of fifty dollars, to a
family scholarship; or, on payment of one hundred dollars,
to tuition for thirty years; or, on payment of four hundred
dollars, to a perpetual scholarship, to be designated by whatever name the contributor might select. Contracts of the
kind were outstanding at the respective times when each of
the two acts of the legislature in question was passed, and
the complainants in the third case are owners of such scholarships, and they bring their bill of complaint, for themselves
and such other persons owning such scholarships as may desire to unite in the bill for the relief therein prayed. They
pray that both of the before-mentioned acts of the legislature
may be declared null and void as repugnant both to the
State and Federal Constitution, but it will be sufficient to
remark, without entering into any further explanations, that
the second question is the only one which can be re-examined
in this court. What they claim is that the acts of the legislature in question impair the obligation of their contracts
for scholarship as made with the trustees of Jefferson College before the two institutions were united in one corporation. Reference must be made to the charter creating the
union as well as to the original charters in order to ascertain
whether there is any foundation for the allegations of the
bill of complaint.
By the first section of the act creating the union it is provided that the new corporation "shall possess and enjoy all
the capacities, powers, privileges, immunities, and franchises
which were conferred upon and held by said colleges of Jefferson and Washington and the trustees thereof, with such
enlargements and subject to such changes therein as are

made by this act." Section two also provides that all the
real and personal property held and possessed by or in trust
for the said colleges, with all endowment funds, choses in
action, stocks, bequests, and devises, and all other rights
whatever to them belonging, are thereby transferred to and
vested in the new corporation; and the further provision is
that "all the several liabilities of said two colleges or corporations, by either of them suffered or created, including the
scholarships heretofore granted by and obligatory upon each
of them, are hereby imposed upon and declared to be assumed by the corporation hereby created, which shall discharge and perform the same without diminution or abatement."
Undoubtedly the corporate franchises of the two institutions were contracts of the description protected by that
clause of the Constitution which ordains that no State shall
pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts, but the
contract involved in such an act of incorporation is a contract between the State and the corporation, and as such the
terms of the contract may, as a general rule, be altered,
modified, or amended by the assent of the corporation, even
though the charter contains no such reservation and there
was none such existing in any general law of the State at
the time the charter was granted. Persons making contracts with a private corporation know that the legislature,
even without the assent of the corporation, may amend,
alter, or modify their charters in all cases where the power
to do so is reserved in the charter or in any antecedent general law in operation at the time the charter was granted,
and they also know that such amendments, alterations, and
modifications may, as a general rule, be made by the legislature with the assent of the corporation, even in cases where
the charter is unconditional in its terms and there is no general law of the State containing any such reservation. Such
contracts made between individuals and the corporation do
not vary or in any manner change or modify the relation
between the State and the corporation in respect to the
right of the State to alter, modify, or amend such a charter,

Dec. 1871.]

PENNSYLVANIA COLLEGE CASES.
Opinion of the court.

as the power to pass such laws depends upon the assent of
the corporation or upon some reservation made at the time,
as evidenced by some pre-existing general law or by an express provision incorporated into the charter. Cases arise
undoubtedly where a court of equity will enjoin a corporation not to proceed under an amendment to their charter
passed by their assent, as where the effect would be to enable the corporation to violate their contracts with third
persons, but no such question is here presented for the decision of this court, nor can it ever be under a writ of error
to a State court. Questions of that kind are addressed very
largely to the judicial discretion of the court and create the
necessity for inquiry into the facts of the case and for au examination into all the surrounding circumstances.* Beyond
doubt such a question may be presented in the Circuit Court
in the exercise of its jurisdiction, concurrent with the State
courts, but it is clear that such a question can never be
brought here for re-examination by a writ of error to a State
court, as such a writ only removes into this court the questions, or some one of the questions, described in the twentyfifth section of the Judiciary Act.t Considerations of that
kind must, therefore, be dismissed, as the only question presented for decision is whether the acts of the legislature
mentioned in the bill of complaint impair the obligation of
the contracts for scholarship made by the complainants with
the trustees of Jefferson College.
Decided cases are referred to in which it is held that the
trustees of such an institution, where the terms of the charter
amount to a contract and the charter contains no reservation
of a right to alter, modify, or amend it, cannot consent to
any change in the charter made by the legislature, which
contemplates a diversion of the funds of the institution to
any other purpose than that described and declared in the
original charter. All, or nearly all of such decisions are
based on a state of facts where an attempt was made to take

Opinion of the court.

the control of such an institution from one religious sect or
denomination and to give the control of it to another and a
different sect or denomination, in violation of the intent and
purpose of the original donors of the institution.* Questions of that kind, however, are not involved in the present
record, nor do the court intend to express any opinion in
respect to such a controversy. Charters of the kind may
certainly be altered, modified, or amended in all cases where
the power to pass such laws is reserved in the charter or in
some antecedent general law, nor can it be doubted that the
assent of the corporation is sufficient to render such legislation valid, unless it appears that the new legislation will
have the effect to change the control of the institution, or to
divert the fund of the donors to some new use inconsistent
with the intent and purpose for which the endowment was
originally made.t Consent of the corporation, it is conceded,
is sufficient to warrant alteration, modification, and amendments in the charters of moneyed, business, and commercial
corporations, and it is not perceived that the question presented in this record stands upon any different footing from
such as arise out of legislation of that character, as the principal objection to the legislation in question is that the removal of Jefferson College to the newly selected location
exposes the complainants, as owners of the scholarships, to
increased expense and to additional inconvenience.t They
do not pretend that the effect of the new legislation will be
to lessen the influence and usefulness of the college, or to
divert the funds to a different purpose from that which was
intended by the donors, nor that it will have the effect to
change the character of the institution from the original
purpose and design of its founders. Pretences of the kind,
if set up, could not be supported, as the whole record shows
that the two acts of Assembly were passed at the earnest
solicitation of the patrons of the two institutions as well as
at the request of the respective boards of trustees.

Opinion of the court.

Even suppose that the consent of the corporation is no
answer to the objections of the complainants, still the decree
of the State court must be affirmed, as it is clear that the
reservation in the charter fully warranted the legislature in
passing both the acts which are the subject of complaint.*
Suggestion may be made that the reservation even in the
original charter is not expressed in direct terms, but the
terms are the same as those employed in the charter which
was the subject of judicial examination in the case of Commonwealth v. .Bonsall et al.,t which was decided more than
thirty years ago by the Supreme Court of the State. Provision was made in the charter in that case that the constitution of a certain public school should not be altered or
alterable by any law of the trustees, or in any other manner
than by an act of the legislature of this.State. When incorporated the charter of the school provided that the trustees
should be chosen by such persons as had contributed or
should contribute to the amount of forty shillings for the
purposes of the corporation. Pursuant to the petition of
the trustees the legislature passed an act which repealed that
clause of the charter, and provided that all the citizens residing within the limits of the township should be entitled
to vote at all such elections, and the Supreme Court of the
State held unanimously that the act of Assembly was a valid
act, even though it was not accepted by the corporation.
Reference is made to that case to show that the clause in
the charter of Jefferson College, called the reservation, furnished complete authority to alter, modify, or amend the
charter, and certainly it must be conceded that that case is
a decisive authority to that point.1
Controlled by these reasons the court is of the opinion
that the act uniting the two colleges in one corporation was
a valid act even as against the complainants in the third case.

INSURANCE COMPANY V.

WILKINSON.

[Sup. Ct.

Syllabus.

They complain also of the supplementary act, but they
hardly contend that the legislature, in passing the act to
unite the two institutions, parted with any power which was
reserved in the original charter of Jefferson College to enact
any proper law to alter, modify, or amend the act providing
for that union. Extended argument upon that topic does
not seem to be necessary, as there is not a word in the act
which fivors such a construction or which gives such a
theory the slightest support. Proper care was taken by
the legislature to protect the rights of these complainants
by incorporating into the act uniting the two colleges a
provision that the new corporation should discharge and
perform those liabilities without diminution or abatement.
Such contracts were made with the trustees and not with
the State, and it is a mistake to suppose that the existence
of such a contract between the corporation and an individual
would inhibit the legislature from altering, modi fying, or
amending the charter of the corporation by virtue of a right
reserved to that effect, or with the assent of the corporation,
if, in view of all the circumstances, the legislature should
see fit to exercise that power.
DECREE IN

EACH CASE AFFIRMED.

INSURANCE COMPANY V. WILKINSON.

1. The assured, in a life policy in reply to the question, "had she ever bad
a serious personal injury," answered " no." She had, ten years before,
fallen from a tree. The criteria of a serious personal injury considered.
2. This is not to be determined exclusively by the impressions of the matter
at the time; but its more or less prominent influence on the health,
strength, and longevity of the party is to be taken into account, and
the jury are to decide from these and the nature of the injury whether
it was so serious as to make its non-disclosure avoid the policy.
3. Insurance companies who do business by agencies at a distance from
their principal place of business are responsible for the acts of the agent
within the general scope of the business intrusted to his care, and no
limitations of his authority will be binding on parties with whom he
deals which are not brought to their knowledge.
