Under the practice of Louisiana, peremptory exceptions must be considered as specially pleaded when they are set forth in writing, in a specific or Jetailed form.
and judgment prayed on them.
Although the court should refuse to receive exceptions thus tendered, yet if the
party has the benefit of them on a motion in arrest of judgment and in a bill of
exceptions, the refusal of the court is not a sufficient cause for reversal.
The statute of Louisiana, requiring their courts to have the testimony taken down in
all cases where an appeal lies to the Supreme Court, and the. adoption of this rule
by the court of the United States, includes only cases where an appeal (technically speaking) lies, and not cases which are carried to an appellate court by
writ of error.
Where the laws permit a waiver of a trial by jury, it is too late to raise an objection that the waiver was not made a matter of record, after the case has proceeded to a hearing.
In a suit by the first indorser of promissory notes against a second indorser, upon an
alleged contract that the second indorser would bear half the loss which might
accrue from their non-payment by the drawer, it is not a sufficient objection to
the jurisdiction of the court, that the second indorsee and defendant were citizens of the same State. Such an objection would be well founded if the suit
had been upon the notes.
But not where the suit is brought upon a collateral contract.
A contract between two indorsers, that they will divide the loss between them, is
a good contract, and founded o- a sufficient consideration.
Being a collaterai contract, by parol, parel evidence can be given to prove it. The
payee is a competent witness, and so is the notary, bringing with him the act of
sale.

Tuis case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit

Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana.

The act of sale, which was signed by Barrow and Carr, and executed before Louis T. Caire, a.notary public, contained, amongst
other things, the following provisions, viz. :1. After reciting the cash payment, it proceeded thus - "And
in payment of the balance, the said purchaser handed over to rie,
the undersigned notary, six promissory notes, bearing even date
herewith, subscribed by him, to the order [of] John S. Preston,
indorsed by him, the said John S. Preston, "domiciliated in the
parish of Ascension, as first indorser, and by George W. Phillips,
domiciliated in the parish of Assumption, as second indorser, it
being understood that, although each of'the indorsers is responsible
for the whole amount of said notes, they are between themselves
equally responsible ; said notes have been made payable at the domicile of the Union Bank of Louisiana, and their amount and terms
of payment are as follows, viz." (then followed an enumeration of
the notes as above).
2. An agreement that the property should stand mortgaged.
3.. An agreement that the last-mentioned notes should be substituted, if possible, for those given by Barrow to Allain, and if it

280

should not be possible to do so, then that payments made upon the
last set of notes should be applied to the first set, as they became
due.
The notes given by Carr to Barrow were indorsed by John S.
Preston, as the first indorser, and by George W. Phillips, as the
second indorser.
On the 1st of March, 1838, the first note became due, and was
not paid by Carr. But it appeared by the record not to have been
protested until the .30th of March, 1839.
On the 1st of March, 1839, another note became due, which
appears to have been protested in proper time.
On the 5th of April, 1839, Barrow filed a petition in the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Louisiana
(a State court), representing the above-mentioned facts, and stating
further, that he had made the necessary payments and arrangements
with Allain, respecting the notes due in 1837, 1838 and 1839,
and praying for a sale of the property.
On the 1st of March, 1840, another note fell due, which was not
paid, and was protested.
On the 15th of August, 1840, the property was sold in block by
the sheriff to Isaac T. Preston, for his brother, John S. Preston,
for the sum of $ 67,500, the purchaser assuming the payment of
the notes due in 1841, 1842, and 1843.
On the 20th of August, 1840, the sheriff executed q deed for
the property to John S.'Preston.
On the 17th of February, 1841, Preston, calling himself a citizen- of South Carolina, filed a petition in the Circuit Court of the
United States against Phillips, a citizen 6f Louisia-a, alleging that,by virtue of the agreement between them, Phillips was bound to
pay to him the one half of all that be had paid, being $28,702.87,.
with legal interest on $ 9,014.13 from the 4th day of March, 1838,
and like interest ou $ 9,6567.621 from the 4th day of March,
1839. And on $ 10,121, from the 4th day of March, 1840, with
half the-costs of protests.
On the 26th of February, 1841, the counsel of Phillips filed an
exception, being a plea to the juisdiction of the court, upon the
ground that Barrow was the assigor of the notes to Preston, and
that Barrow, being a citizen of the same State with Phillips, 'was
incapable of suing him in the United States court.
On the 20th of April, 1841, the court overruled this exception,
and Phillips filed an answer, denying " all and singular the allegations contained in the plaintiff's petition, and particularly that he
ever promised or undertook to be responsible on the notes described in said petition, in any other capacity except as second indorser and after and in default of the plaintiff, or that the said notes
ever were duly protested, and notice given to this defendant."
In April, 1841, the cause came up for bearing. On the trial
the following testimony was filed.

JANUARY TERM, 1847.

281

Phillips v. Preston.

Testimony taken by Consent, this .lpril 23d, 1841.
JOHN S. PRESTON V. GEORGE W.

PHILLIPS.

The testimony of Robert R. Barrow, a witness for the plaintiff,
who, being duly sworn, deposeth and saith, being asked by the
plaintiff what he knows in relation to an agreement between John
S. Preston and George W. Phillips, in relation to their indorsement of certain riotes given by Samuel J. Carr to him, on payment
of a plantation and slaves in Point Coupee, purchased from him by
said Carr, about the 17th of March, 1837.
(The cbungel of the defendant, Seth Barton, Esq., objecting to
the above question, and reserving all legal exceptions.)
The witness says, that he was present at the time the notes were
signed, about the 17th of Ma'rch, 1837. Samuel J. Carr, the plaintiff, and defendant, with deponent, met by appointment at the time
of the sale, at Cake's office, before whom the act was passed ; the
act was already prepared when'the aforesaid parties met, it having
been prepared by the notary, under the directions of witness and
said Carr ; the notes were also- drawn up and ready to be signed,
under Carr and witness's directions and instructions ; the notes were
then handed to the plaintiff to indorse ; when about to sign, Mr.
Preston observed that he thought -those notes were to have been
drawn to the order of Phillips, the defendant. Mr. Carr replied,
that he did not know that it would make any difference. And thereupon Colonel Preston turned round, and, addressing - himself to
Colonel Phillips, the defendant, said he supposed it made no difference, and -aid he. wished it particularly understood between
them, that in case Carr should fail 'to pay the notes, and the indorsers compelled to pay them, that he (Phillips) and .Preston
should be "qually bound, and share alike in the loss, and that he,
Preston,*wished it so stated in the act. After this conversation,
Colonel Preston turned to Mr. Cake, the notary, and remarked,.
that he wished it noted in the act, that the indorsers should be bound
alike on failure of Carr. - The notary then put down on paper the
exact words that Colonel Preston dictated ; all the parties were
near each other, and participating more or less in the conversation.
After this, Colonel Preston and Colonel Phillips indorsed the notes
and handed them- over to the notary ; Colonef Preston indorsed
first, and Colonel Phillips next ; and instructions were given to the
notary, Caire, to draw up a new'act, inserting the clause aforesaid,
as regards the equal liability of the indorsers ; and then, to identify
the notes with the act, the clause was added in the new act, and
witness, when his attention was called to it by Mr. Cake, obje6ted
to its insertion, because, as he then thought, it made the indorsers
liable to him for only their half. Mr. Care called upon an attorney
at law, whose name witness does not remember, to explain it, and
*thereupon witness was satisfied that it did not affect him, but only
24 *

282

SUPREME COURT.
Phillips v. Preston.

related to the respective liabilities of the indorsers. The act was
not signed at the time the notes were given, but was signed at a
different time on that day, or the day next; but he cannot remember.
Witness recollects the conversation very distinctly, as it was impressed on 'his mind at the time, and has frequently thought of it
since.
Being shown the copy of the act annexed to the petition, and
the 6lause at the top of the page, says, they are the same referred
to by him. The three notes marked A, B, and C, filed with this
deposition, are part of the consideration of the sale ; Colonel Preston. took up three of the notes, A, B, and C, and paid them after
protest, interest and all charges, which payment was made before
this suit was instituted. The tract of land in West Feliciana,
mortgaged to secure the payment of these notes, was seized and
sold to pay prior mortgages of said Carr, and consequently there
was nothing to come from that land to pay this debt of Carr's, for
the plantation sold as aforesaid ; this tract was woodland ; Colonel
Preston has paid the notes which have matured, and- has assumed
the balance due, he having purchased in the property mortgaged, to
secure the payment of the notes aforesaid.
The defendant, by S. Barton, his attorney, objects to th whol
of the foregoing deposition of the witness, as illegal and incompetent ; and specially to all such parts of it as are hearsay or secondary
proof ; and specially, also, to all such parts of it as go to vary, or
contradict, or explain the writfen testimony to which the witness
refers ; and particularly such parts as tend to prove any thing against
or beyond the authentic act of sale, on file in this cause, and
insisting on such objections (to be urged- on trial), and waiving no
part thereof, cross-examines the .witness, under the above reserva.
tions.
Witness never had the act of sale referred to -recorded in West
Feliciana i that the property in Feliciana was sold for judgments
of younger date than the sale aforesaid ; the first note of $ 18,000
was paid by a renewal of note payable to the Union Bank; the
other two were paid by drafts ; the note given on renewal was not
indorsed by Colonel Phillips ; Colonel Phillips was no party to the
drafts referred 'to ; the drafts were on time and suited witness ;
witness thought.fro-. appearances that Preston and Phillips were
just introduced to each other, or n.ot long acquainted, when they
met at the notary's, as above related ; some short time before the
act was passed,.witness met Colonel Phillips at the theatre, and had
-some conversation about his indorsing for Carr-, said he,- Phillips,
had promised to indorse for Carr, but Carr said it Would only be
temporarily, as he. had made arrangements to change the indorsements, by substituting Colonel Isaac T. Preston in the place ; witness thinks that Colonel Phillips must have heard the convergation
'related to aboveias it took place at the notary's ; does not recollect

JANUARf TERM, 1847.

283

Phillips v. Preston.

that Phillips made any reply to Colonel Preston ; Phillips must
have heard it, as the conversation was made direct by Preston to
him ; and Phillips must have heard the direction of Preston to the
notary, to insert the clause ; thinks they met at. the notary's at ten
or eleven in the morning ; neither the plaintiff or defendant attended
at any other time at the notary's than that mentioned, nor were they
present when he and Carr executed the act, nor can he say that
Phillips has seen the act ; there was no arrangement between him
and Preston, in relation to the sale of the property. It is admitted,
that the'property was purchased by Colonel Preston, plaintiff, for
$67,500 ; that the third note was paid by draft prior to the sale
under the seizure and sale ;. the three last notes assumed by Preston are in the hands of witness ; witness has never had the mortgage raised, to secure the last three notes.

in the petition ; the court overruled the objection, and admitted the
evidence ; and to its decision therein the defendant excepts. 5th. The plaintiff offered Louis T. Caire (the notary before whom
the act of sale was passed that is described in the petition) as a

witness to prove the allegations of the petition, and a verbal agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, made before the
passing of the act of sale, that, as between themselves, they would
be equally liable'as indorsers, as stated in the petition. And, also,
to prove by him that the clause in the act of sale, setting forth said
agreement, was inserted therein by the instruction of the plaintiff, in
the presence of the defendant, and without any objection thereto on
his part. W"hereupon the defendant objected to the admission of
such evidence ; but the court overruled the objection, and admitted
the evidence ; and'to its decision therein the defendant excepts.
6th.' The plaintiff offer-ed in evidence the copy of the act of sale
described'in the petition, and marked (C) ,to the admission of which,
and such parts thereof as were adduced for the purpose, and tended
to prove any agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, as
to their equal liability between themselves, upon their several indorsements upon the promissory notes described in the petition, and
to charge the defendant with any liability resulting therefrom, the
defendant objected.; but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence ; and to such, its decision, the defendant excepts.
7th. The plaintiff offered in evidence the record of the suit of
Robert R. Barrow v. S. JohWi Carr, being the. order of seizure

purporting to be an act of sale from the sheriff of Point Coupee,
adjudicating the property last mentioned to the plaintiff, as the purchaser at public sale ; to the admission whereof the defendant objected, but the court overruled the objection ; to which decision of
the court the defendant excepts.
The defendant, by his attorney, haying reserved the foregoing
.several exceptions, as the o "casions thereof severally arose in the
course of the trial, and at the suggestion of the court, the drafting of
separate bills of exceptions were dispensed with, and the general bill
for the whole postponed,. till the plaintiff's testiniony was closed.
He now respectfully presents to the 'court this his bill of exceptions, embracing all the several points reserved, and prays the court

JOHN S. PRESTON v. GEORGE W. PHILLIPS. dpril term, 1841.
And now at said term came the defendant, George W. Phillips,
by his attorney, and (not waiving but insisting on his answer heretofore filed in this cause), availing himself of the provisions of the
Louisiana code of practice in that behalf, and as' the same has
been adopted by this honorable court, be here presents his peremptory exceptions, founded in law, to the further maintenance of
this suit.
And for causes of peremptory exception, he sets forth and assigns the following, t6 wit,: 1st. The agreement stated in the petition to have been entered
into by the plaintiff and defendant is nowhere alleged to have been
in writing, or signed by the parties, or embodied in any instrument
of writing to which they were parties, or to which they, or either
of them, assented, by their presence or otherwise, at the time of the
execution of any such instrument of writing, by those who may
have been parties thereto.
2d. The petition in no part alleges any, or a. sufficient, consideration for the said supposed agreement, nor does it allege or show,
that the said agreement imported in itself any, or a sufficient, consideration.
- 3d. The said supposed agreement is at variance with, and in
contradiction of, and seeks to change, the liabilities and relations of
the plaintiff and defe'ndafit to each other, in relation to certain contracts in writing, to which the petition alleges they are parties, by
respectively signing their names on the backs of six several promissory notes, as first and second indorsers thereof.
4th. The petition, in no part of it, alleges that either the plaintiff or the defendant were duly notified of the dishonor of any of the
said promissory notes, which it alleges to have been protested for
non-payment, as they severally matured, nor does the petition show
in what manner the plaintiff was, or could have been, coerced to
make the several payments he alleges he has made.
5th. All the statements and allegations of the petitions in reference to any agreement or circumstance, out of which any liability of the defendant to the plaintiff is supposed to arise," are
loose, vague, and indefinite, and insufficient in law to put the parties
to their proofs upon the several issues of fact which the pleadings'
present.
Wherefore, and for divers other go-od reasons in this behalf, the
defendant prays judgment of this honorable court upon the said

286

petition, and the dismissal thereof, with a further iudgment for costs
in this behalf most unjustly sustained.

And afterwards, to wit, on the 29th day of April, 1841, the
following motion in arrest of judgment was filed.
United States of lmerica :- Circuit Court *of the United States,
holden af .New Orleans, in and for the Eastern District of
Louisiana.
JOHN S. PRESTON V. GEORGE W. PHILLIPS. qpril term, 1841.
And now comes the defendant, by his attorney, and prays the
court to arrest the judgment in this-case, and sets forth and assigns
as grounds for the motion :1st. That the plaintiff's petition does not allege that the agreement described therein, and out of which the defendant's liability is
supposed to arise, was signed by either plaintiff or defendant, or
that the same was in writing.
2d. The petition does not allege any, or a sufficient, consideration for the agreement which it states to have been entered into by
the defendant, to and with the plaintiff.
3d. The agreement stated in the petition is at variance with, and
in contradiction of, the contract of indorsements, which arises from
the signatures of plaintiff and defendant as first and second indorsers,
upon several promissory notes, whinh the petition alleges they
signed as such.
4th.' There is no alleation in the petition of notice or notices
being given, either to plaintiff or defendant, of the dishonor or
protest of any one of the said promissory notes, as they respectively
matured.
5th. The evidence adduced at the trial, as shown by the statement of facts, and the several documentary proofs to which it
makes reference, is not sufficient in law to support the issues on the
plaintiff's behalf to be maintained, or to authorize any judgment in
favor of the plaintiff, and against the defendant.
6th. A trial of this cause by the court, and without the imervention of a jury, unless there had been an express waiver of record, is
not authorized by the law regulating the practice of this court.
Wherefore, the defendant prays that the judgment be arrested,
that the plaintiff take nothing by his p]aint, that his petition be
dismissed, and that the defendant may go hence without day, and
recover of the plaintiff his costs in this behalf most wrongfully
sustained.

The defendant's counsel moved an arrest of judgment, upon the
grounds just stated, which motion was overruled.
To review all these oliinions of the court, the case was brought
up to this court.
The cause was argued by ,Mr. Barton for the plaintiff in error,
who contended, that if Preston obtained the notes from Barrow by
substitution, then the plea to the jurisdiction of tie court must he
sustained, because Barrow and the original defendant, Phillips, were
both citizens of Louisiana. 4 Dall. 8, 10, -11.

Mr. Justice WOODBURY delivered the opinion of the court.
The points which have been argued in this -case are in part connected with matters of form, and in part with what is substance.
We shall dispose of the fixst, before proceeding to examine the last..
The principal objection in respect to form is, that the court below refused to receive what are called in the practice of the State
of Louisiana "peremptory exceptions." These are of two kinds,
one as to form, and one as to law. Those in this case were offered
as "peremptory exceptions, founded in law." By the Code of
Practice in Louisiana, 'rt. 345, such exceptions "may be
pleaded inevery stage of the action previous to the definitive judgment." 1 Louisiana R. 315 ; 4 Martin, (N. S.) 437.
'Hence, though offered here after the pleadings were read, they
are admissible, while peremptory exceptions relating to form would
not be then admissible. See art. 344. The only doubt as to
their being duly offered arises from the provision in the 346th article, which requires them to "be pleaded specially," and they are
not here in the precise form of a special plea ai common law. But,
in the absence of any adjudged cases to the contrary, we are inclined to think, that, under the liberal and general pleading in use in
Louisiana, these exceptions must be considered as "specially
pleaded," when set forth as they were here in writing, and in a
specific or detailed form, and judgment prayed on them in favor of
the present plaintiff. Has he then been deprived of the advantage
attached to them ? That is the important inquiry. On examination
of the record it will be seen, that he had the benefit of all.these exceptions, first in a motion in arrest of judgment.
Again, he had the benefit of all the important matter in those exceptions by the bill which was afterwards filed and allowed, and
upon which this writ of error has been brought. We cannot, therefore, perceive that he has suffered any by the refusal of the court to
receive these peremptory exceptions when first offered.
The case in thig respect is like one, at common la*, where the
defendant should propose to demur generally to the declaration, but,
being refused, objects to the sufficiency of it to cover various portions of the evidence as it is offered, and also objects to the sufficiency k)f
the declaration ifi
arrest of judgment. He thus, by a subsequenti bill of exceptions to the rulings on the testimbny and on the
sufficiency of the declaration, obtainA every advantage that he could
have had under his general demurrer, and-thus suffers nothing which
requires .a reversal of the-judgment and a new trial for his relief

JANUARY TERM, 1847.

Phillips -v. Preston.

The next objection of a formal character is, that the court beloW
refused, though requested by the original defendant, to have the
clerk take down in writing and file the testimony of the witnsses
and the documentary evidence.
It is true, that by a statute of Louisiana, passed July 20th, 1817,
their courts are directed to have the testimony taken down "cin all
cases where an appeal lies to the Supreme Court, if either party
require it." It is also true, that an act of Congress, passed May26th, 1824 (4 Statutes at Large, 63), has made the practice existing
in Louisiana the guide to that in the courts of the United States,
when sitting in that State, except as it may be modified by rules of
the judge of the United States court.
And it is further shown in this record, that the district judge
there, November 20th, 1837, adopted the practice of Louisiana.
as then existing, in all cases not. of admiralty jurisdiction.
In a cause once decided by this court, which was connected with
this point, Wilcox et al. v. Hunt, 13 Peters, 378, it was remarked, that the plea put in there as a part of the. State practice,
as the latter had not been adopted, was not received. But the practice there standing differently from that which is urged in this case,
that decision does not control the present one.
In considering, then, the propriety of the ruling of the court here,
it is first to be noticed, that, by the words of the 'statute, this testimony is to be taken down and filed only in those cases "where an
appeal lies." That means, of course, a technical appeal, where the
facts are to be reviewed and reconsidered, for in such an one only
is there any use in taking them down. But in the present case no
appeal of that character lay to this court, but merely a writ of errbr
to bring the law and not the facts here for reexamination. To
construe the act of 1824 as if meaning to.devolve on this court such
a refxamination of facts, without a trial by jury, in a case at law,
like this, and not one in equity ori admiralty, would be to give to it
an unconstitutional operation, dangerous to the trial by jury, and at
times subversive of the public liberties. Parsons v. Bedford et
al., 3 Peters, 448.
In a case of chancery or admiralty jurisdiction it might be different, as in those, by the law of the land, a technical appeal lies, and
the facts are there open to reconsideration- in this court. Livingston v. Story, 9 Peters, 632 ; McCollum v. Eager, 2 Howard,'64.
In this case, likewise, it would be totally useless to have all the
facts taken down in that manner, because, if so taken and sent up
here, it would be irrelevant and improperly burdening the record,
as much as the whole charge and opinion of the judge, instead of the
naked points excepted to. See 28th rule of this court, and Zeller's
Lessee v. Eckert et al., 4 How. 297, 298. If a case comes up in
that manner, this court never reconsiders or reexamine's all the
facts, but merely the law arising on them, as if a bill of exceptions
25

SUPREME COURT.
Phillips v. Preston.

had been properly filed. This has been decided already in Parsons
v. Armor et al., 3 Peters, 425; Minor v. Tillotson5 2 How. 394.
Beside these considerations, showing that neither the words of
the statute, nor the reasons for it, reach a case like this, there is
another in the practice and laws of Louisiana, which shows that this
provision does not extend to a cause like the. present in this court.
There the c6urt of appeal, even in cases at law, often decides on all.
the facts as well as the law ; but not so, here.. The court there
miy be substituted for'a jury by consent of the parties in a trial at
law, and were in this case below. But no such power can be conferred on this Supreme Court by parties in cases at law ; and, as
before shown, it exists under 'acts of Congress merely in cases in
equity and admiraity.
To conclude on this point, then, it will be seen that the plaintiff
in error, notwithstanding the refusal to have the clerk take down this
evidence, has enjoyed all the benefit of it under his bill of exceptions, where it was material and he wished to raise any question of
law on it, and has enjoyed it as fully as if the Whole had been taken
down and filed. And thus he loses nothing and suffers nothing by
the court refusing to do what we think neither the language nor
spirit of the law requires in a case like this. Parsons v- Bedford,
3 Peters, 433.
There are two other objections of form, which appear on the record and may well be noticed, though they are not embodied in the
bill of exceptions. One is as to the waiver of a trial by jury in this
case in the court below. After a hearing there, it was urged, that,
the waiver not having been entered on the record, the" court was
not authorized to proceed without a jury.
But it would hardly be permissible for a party to proceed without
objection in a trial of facts before the court, in a case at law in a
State where the statutes permitted it, and the habits of the people
under the civil law inclined them to favor it, and then, after a decision might be announced which was not satisfactory, to offer such
an objection as this. From its not being incorporated into the bill
of exceptions, or argued at the hearing before us, a strong presumption arises that it has been abandoned.
The other obje-tion is spread upon the early part of the record,
anOI was a proper one for the consideratiofi of the court in that stage
of the case, as it went to its jurisdiction. This was urged on the
ground, that the notes mentioned in the petition of the plaintiff below
belonged or ran originally to R. Barrow, a resident of Louisiana, in
the same State with the defendant, and that his title was assigned to
the plaintiff, and thus the latter cannot sue the defendant in this court,
if Barrow could not. This position would be well taken under the
provision in the lth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, if the
original plaintiff had instituted his suit upon the notes as assignee of
them. See Towne v. Smith, 1 Wood. & Min. 115 ; Vean v. Srmith

America, 4 Dal. 8-11 ; Montalet v. Murray, 4 Cranch, 46. But
so far from that, he does not declare at all on the notes. He sets
out- a separate and different contract as his ground for iecovery,
resting on an original' agreement between him and the defendant ;
and does not set out any assignment, of those notes to himself by
Barrow. Even if he counted on the notes, but not on or through
an assignment of them, this court would have jurisdiction. 6
Wheat. 146 ; 9 ibid. 537 ; 2 Peters, 326 ; 11 ibid. 801 ; 3
Howard, 576, 577 ; 1 Mason, C.0. 251 ; 1 McLane, C. C. 132.
The judge below, then, properly overruled this objection.
We come next to the only remaining question in this case, which
branches into five or six different exceptions. It is a question of
substance, and in some 'respects is not without difficulty. It..is
whether the ground upon which the objection going to the jurisdiction was overruled is well founded in the declaration and the facts,
by showing a separate and independent contract, and-one which had
a good consideration in law.
On looking to the petition, it will be seen that it sets out a sale
of land between other parties ;"the mode of payment stipulated ; the
agreement between the plaintiff and defendant to become indorsers
of certain notes, and divide between them any loss ; the subsequent
failure of the purchaser to pay the notes ; the settlement of them by
the plaintiff, and his right under the agreement and facts to recover
of the defendant one half of the amount. The whole claim proceeds on the collateral agreement, and there is no pretence of
grounding the suit, as holder or indorsee,.on any promises contained
in the notes, or in the indorsements on them.
There is also a good consideration for this collateral agreement.
It is the promise of the plaintiff befdrehand to loose one half, if the
defendant would become a surety with him and loose the other.half,
and the actual payment afterwards of the whole by the aplaintiff.
Being then a collateral agreement by parol, which is sued, it stands
free from the objection to the parol evidence offered to prove it.
Were the action on the notes, ahd this evidence offered to contradict them,' it would be entirely different ; because, in an actioft on
a note, parol testimony is not competent t6 vary its written terms
and probably not to vary a blank indorsement by the payee from
what the law imports. Civil Code of Louisiana, art. 2256 ; Stone
et al.v. Vincent, 6 Martin, (N. S.) 517 ; 15 La. U. 539 ; 10 ibid.
205 ; 1 Peters's C. C. R. 84 ; Bank of the United States v. Deine,

(N. S.) 641 ; Chitty on Bills, 541 ; 12 Eas'i4 ; 4 Barn. & Ald.
454. So, between the contracting parties, likewise, all 'prior conversation is supposed, as far as binding, to be embodied into the
written contract. 4 Louisiana R. 269 ; Taylor v.Riggs, I Peters,
591 :'8 Wheat. 211. But the parol evidence here is not offered

292

SUPREME

COURT.

Phillips v. Preston.

in any action on the note, or to alter its terms or its indorsments; nor
is any prior or contemporaneous conversation offered to vary the
note, or its indorsement, in an action founded on either of them.
But it is offered to prove a separate contract, which was made by
parol, and is of as high a character as the law requires in such cases,
and this evidence is plenary and entirely satisfactory to substantiate
the separate contract. It is true, at the same time, that, after a
prior indorser has paid a note, he cannot recover, even in an action,
not on it, but for contribution of one half fr6ir a second indorser,
if they were not in fact joint sureties, nor in fact made any collateral contract whatever, nor in fact had any communication whatever
as to 'their liability. McDonald v. Magruder, 3 Peters, 474 ; 3
Harris & Johns. 125 ; 7 Johns. 367.
But the present is a case differing, toto ecelo, from that. Here,
by a deliberate arrangement before a public notary, and by the positive evidence of two witnesses, the two indorsers were co-sureties, and specially agreed to bear any loss equally between them ;
and the right to recover is, therefore, entirely clear. 3 Peters, 477 ;
Douglass v. Waddle, 1 Hammond, 413, 420 ; Deering v. The
Earl of Winchelsea, 2 Bos. & Pull. 270.
There are two or three other views connected with this part of
the case, which may be usefully adverted to, but by which we do
not decide it.
Thus, where a person like Phillips, the original defendant, was
not a party to a note, but put his name on the back of it, parol testimony has been deemed competent to show the real object for which
it was placed there ; and especially if it did not contradict any legal
implication fromn the name being there. And hbnee, under circumsiances like these, where, as in Louisiana and some other States,
it is implied by law that such a person puts his name there as a surety
or guarantor, no objection exists to parol proof to that effect. 10
Louisiana R. 374 ; Lawson v. Oakey, 14 ibid. 386 ; Nelson v.
Dubois, 13 Johns. 175; Dean v. Hall, 17 Wend. 214 ; 5 Mass.
R. 358 ; 12 ibid. 281; 1 Vermont R. 136 ; Ulen v..Kitteridge, 7 Mass. R. 233; 4 Wash. C. C. R. 480; 5 Serg. &
Rawle, 363. In White v. Howland, 9 Mass. R. 314, he is held
to be liable as if signing with the maker as a surety. But however
much, in some States, the practice may go beyond this in suits between the parties to the agreement, as in I Hammond, 420, and 5
Serg. & Rawle, 363, it could generally not be competent to prove
any thing by parol, in actions on the note, contrary to what is writton or to what is implied in law. Bank of the United States v.
Dunn, 6 Peters, 59.
And in other States and in other circumstances, where the inference of law is not that such a name is placed-there as a surety, it is
veiy doubtful whether, in a suit on the note, proof that he did it
only as a surety is competent. 6 Martin, (N. S.) 517 ; Bank of
the United State v. Dunn, 6 Peters, 59.

JANUARY TERM,

Phillips v. Preston.

In England, in the case of such a name on the back of a bill of
exchange, the person may be treated as a new .drawer (Chitty on
Bills, 241) ; and if thd payee there has also iidorsed the note, the
implication deemed most proper is, that another name ou the back
is that of a second indorser, and should so be held in the hands of
third persons. Chitty on Bills, 188, 528 ; Holt's Nisi Prius, 470 ;
5 Adolph. & Ellis, 436 ; 6 Nev. & Man. 723. So, 6 Martin, 517.
It will be seen, however, that these last are generally cases of actions on the notes or bills of exchange themselves, while the present
case is not brought on the note itself, but on a distinct and collateral contract.
Another suggestion bearing on the case might be, that in Louisiana the surety, when paying, may step into the shoes of his creditor, if
he pleases, by subrogation, and enjoy all his rights against the debtors
or other sureties. Hewes et al. v. Pierce, 1 Martin, (N. S.) 361 ;
Calliham v. Fanner, 3 Rob. (Louisiana) 299 ; Civil Code of Louisiana, art. 2157. But there the suit is probably in the creditor's
name, and not, as here, in that of the surety. So, in some countries where the civil law prevails, such a contract as this, deliberately made before a notary, and by him reduced to writing by request
of the parties, would in law be deemed equivalent to a contract in
writing; and on that ground be admissible even in a suit on the
note between the original parties to it.
The doings of the parties thus have a sort of public form given
to them, quasi judicial, and they are, bound by them, though
not signed by the parties. 2 Domat's Civil Law, b. 2, tit. 1,
§ 1, art. 28, and tit. 5, § 5, pp. 661, 662. It would be there
deemed an act of too much deliberation by the parties, and of
too much formality before that public officer, to be treated merely
as an ordinary verbal arrangemeit. Coop. Justinian, 586 ; 3
Burr. 1671 ; Story on Bills, § 277. But, though the Louisiana
code, founded chiefly on the civil law, may not expressly abrogate
such a doctrine, it does not in terms make records by a notary valid,
unless signed by the parties, or consisting of copies of papers signed
by the parties and ackn6wledged before witnesses. Civil Code,
art. 2231,2413 ; 8 Martin, (N. S.) 568 ; 10 Louisiana R. 207,
354. And though the paper containing this is signed by the parties to the sale and attested by witnesses, it is not signed by Preston and Phillips, the parties to this arrangement.
It is not necessary, however, to decide absolutely on the effect
of either of these last views. Deeming the action here to be
founded on the collateral agreement) and deeming the evidence offered to be competent, for the reasons first stated under this head,
these conclusions will virtually dispose of the last six exceptions
contained in the record of this case.
Thus, as to Barrow's deposition, the admission of which was the
grofind of one of these exceptions, it is clearly competent to prove this
.25*

.294

SUPREME COURT.
Phillips v. Preston.

separate parol contract in a suit on that, and not on the note. So,
the certificates and notices, also excepted'to, were properly proved
as a part of the collate-al ttansaction under the general expressions in
the petition, and not. as notices that should be specially set out in a
declaration, where notes are counted on by a holder. In a case
like that) the averment of them and the proof are highly material,
but in the former case they are rather historical and merely a part
of the res gestw, without its being essential to give them in detail.
The original plaintiff avers in the petition that the notes were protested, and that he was obliged to pay them, which would not have
been the case without due notices; and this is quite enough in an
action on a collateral undertaking.
So, the notary's evidence, which is another of the exceptions, becomes under this aspect entirely competent, and the written.memorandum made by him at the time, which is another objection, was also
admissible evidence to refresh his memory, if not per se of the facts
stated in it. Greenleaf's Ev. §§ 436, 437. That it was admissible to refresh his memory, see Smith v. Morgan, 2 M. & Rob.
259 ; Home. v.'McKenzie, 6 Cl. & Fin. 628. Other cases say such
a memorandum is admissible itself to go to the jury. Greenl. Ev.
§ 437, note; 1 Rawle, 182 ; Smith v. Lane etal., 12 Serg. &
Rawle, 84 ; 2 Nott & M'Cord, 831 ; 15 Wend. 193 ; 16 ibid.
586-598. if this last be a rule controverted, the writing here
was " the act'of sale," nd contained other matters as to the transaction in connection with this as the whole terms of sale, which
were clearly competent, and the whole properly went together tothe jury as exhibiting the progress and character of the transaction,
beside being admissible to refresh the memory of the witness.
Bullen v. lichel, -2 Price's Ex. R. 422, 447, 476.
So, the evidence of the sale of Cart's property and of the transfer of it to the original plaintiff, Preston, by the sheriff, and the
terms of the transfer, though objected to, are mere links in the chain
of the transaction, and unexceptionable in that view ; and were, like
the evid~nce of the former sale to Carr by Barrow, duly authenticated.
Upon the whole case, then, we are happy to find that no legal
objection seems to he tenable against making the original defendant
meet an engagement which, on the record, he appears to have been
bound in honor and justice, no less than law, faithfully to discharge.
Although the court have deemed it proper thus to deliver an opinion on this case, as it has been argued by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, yet the death of the plaintiff has since been suggested ;
and no appearance is entered for the defendant. We shall not,
therefore, enter judgment in conformity to the opinion until the detndant or the representatives of the deceased appear.
