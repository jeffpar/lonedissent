THE BRIG CoLLENBERG-Lawurence, Libellant; _Denbreens et al.,

Claimants.
1. A vessel with a perishable cargo, driven by stress of weather out of
her course and into a strange port for repairs, is not liable for such
injuries to the cargo as are caused merely by the delay of the voyage.
2. The consignee cannot recover against the vessel for the loss thus occasioned to the cargo without showing some fault, misbehavior, or
negligence of the master or crew.
3. If the master was justified in putting into a port for repairs-if he
used proper diligence in getting the repairs made-if he exerted
himself to preserve the cargo under the best advice he could getand if he was unable to send the cargo forward by another vesselhis conduct is blameless, and the consignee has no claim against
the vessel.
4. When some portion of a perishable cargo has suffered by decay 'with.
out the fault of the master, and was for that reason left behind on
the voyage, the ship-owners are entitled to recover for the freight on
all that was duly transported and delivered.

This was a libel in the Circuit Court of the United States
fot the southern district of New York, filed by John S. Lawrence
against the brig Lieutenant Admiral Collenberg, for damages
suffered by a cargo of fruit shipped at Palermo for New York
and injured by decay on the voyage. The owners of the vessel denied the right of the consignee of the cargo to recover
the damages he claimed, and filed a cross-libel for freight,
primage, general and particular average. The District Court
dismissed the libel in the first suit, and in the other made a
decree in favor of the ship-owners for the freight, &c. This
was affirmed by the Circuit Court, and the consignee took
appeals to this court in both cases.
.The facts are specially stated in the opinion of Mr. Justice

Clifford.

gel on Carriers, § 87. They must prove the loss occurred by
these perils. Angel, 193; 21 Wend., 190. The nature of the
cargo being tender, extra care was required on the part of
the carrier. Angel, §§ 5 and 6. The facts show that the delay
at Lisbon was protracted unnecessarily, and the management
of the fruit improper and ruinous to it. The rule is settled,
that if any act of the captain is injurious to the cargo or goods
of another he cannot say that other damages helped, or that
something else would have injured the goods if he had not.
If any distinction is to be made in the nature of the damage,
he must clearly show what part of the damage occurred entirely without his fault. 18 How., 233.
All the excuses given for the great delay at Lisbon are insufficient and do not agree with the facts. The log-book of
the ship shows that the weather was not unfavorable to work;
and had it been stormy, the sails, spars and rigging could have
been making ashore under cover. The other reasons for delay
are no better founded. Add to this the fact that the fruit was
placed in a damp storehouse, exposed to the weather, and
picked and handled in a fashion certain to induce decay, and
the whole case shows gross carelessness on all points.
Mr. Owen, of New York, for appellees. The decree dismissing the libel for loss and damage to the fruit should be
affirmed. Beyond question the brig sustained such sea-damage as compelled her to bear away and put into Lisbon to
repair. The evidence shows that the repairs were completed
with reasonable diligence, considering the stormy weather,
the holiday season, which kept mechanics from their work,
and the fact that there was no dock in which a ship could lie
up for repairs, but only an open roadstead.
If the repairs were not completed with despatch, and if some
unnecessary delay occurred in making them, still that is not
sufficient to render the vessel liable for the loss of the fruit.
There is no allegation in the libel of any such delay, or that
the fruit perished from it. McKinlay vs. Morrish, (21 How.,
343.) The fruit had a strong inherent tendency to decay, and,
in the absence of positive proof, it may be inferred that it per-

(18 How., 231;) Angel on Carriers, § 210; Story on Bailments,
492 a. The acts of the master respecting the examination and
re-assortment of the fruit were proper and within the line of
his duty, which was to do all that he could to arrest decay as
soon as he discovered it. Angel on Carriers, §§ 160, 210;
Bird vs. Croswell, (1 Miss. R., 81;) Choteaux vs. Leech, (18 Pa.
Rep., 224;) Lyn vs. Fisher, (12 Miss. R., 272.)
The survey called by the master was in accordance with
usage and his legal duty. There is no question that he acted
in perfect good faith, and in the exercise of his best judgment,
and the vessel should not be held responsible for the damages.
The master was the agent of all concerned in reference to the
fruit as well as the vessel, and his acts were therefore binding
on the owner of the cargo. Judson vs. Warren Ins. Co., (1
Story's C. C. R., 342;) Flanders on Shipping, § 173.
On the question of our claim for freight: Having performed
the voyage and delivered the cargo according to the bill of
lading, the respondent was entitled to his freight upon the
portion delivered, notwithstanding some parts thereof were
damaged. The items for general and particular average were
properly allowed. The bill of lading expressly stipulates for
the payment of freight with "average accustomed," by which
it is supposed the parties meant the ordinary general and particular average to which the cargo might become subject in
the course of the voyage. It is clear that the expenses of
wages and provisions from the time of bearing away to Lisbon,
at least for the time allowed by the District Court, were for
the common benefit of all, which, by the well-settled law in
the United States, were to be contributed for in general aver-age. 2 Phil. on Ins., (2d ed.,) 120, 121; Abbot, (5th Am.
ed.,) 596, note; United States vs. Wild&, (3 Sumn. R., 308.)
The expenses of unlading, storing, &c., the fruit were incurred
for its special benefit, and was therefore a particular average;
in other words, a special charge thereon, which was recoverable
in this action. All these expenses were incurred by the master in good faith and in the exercise of his best judgment for

Mr. Justice CLIFFORD. These are appeals in admiralty
from the respective decrees of the Circuit Court of the United
States for the southern district of New York. Both of the
suits were founded upon the same transaction, and depend substantially upon the same facts.
One was a suit in rem against the brig L. A. Collenberg,
brought by. the appellant, in which it was alleged that certain
merchandise, consigned to the libellant, was shipped at the
port of Palermo, on the twelfth day of December, 1855, on
board the brig, in good order and condition, and that the master signed bills of lading, agreeing to deliver the same in like
good order and condition to the libellant, at the port of New
York; and the charge in the libel was, that he had failed to
deliver seven hundred boxes of lemons, and two thousand one
hundred and fifty boxes of oranges, constituting a large portion of the cargo.
Service of process was waived, and the claimant of the brig
appeared, and, by consent, entered into stipulation, both foi
the costs of the suit and the value of'the vessel. They also
made answer to the suit, denying the allegations of the libel,
and averring that the merchandise mentioned in the bill of
lading, except four hundred and fourteen boxes of lemons and
oranges, which perished from their own inherent tendency to
decay, had been duly transported and delivered.to the libellant in like good order and. condition as when laden on board,
saving, only, the damage occasioned by the perils of the seas,
and such as resulted from the natural decay of the fruit.
On'the second day of July, 1856, they also filed a cross-libel
against the appellant, as consignee of the cargo, to recover the
freight for the transportation of the same, in which they alleged
that they had fully performed the contract set forth in the bill
of lading, and were entitled to have and receive of the respondent, for the freight and primage, including charges, the sum

of twenty-eight hundred and sixty-two dollars and forty-seven
cents.
Most or all the testimony was taken in the first suit, but the
same was also used, by stipulation, in the cross-libel; and, after
a full hearing, the District Court dismissed the libel against
the brig, and in the cross-action entered a decree in favor of
the libellants for the freight, or so much of the same as was
due for that portion of the cargo which had been transported
and delivered. Both decrees, on appeal, were, in all things,
affirmed in the Circuit Court; and thereupon the present appellant, who was the libellant in the first suit and the respondent in the second, appealed both cases to this court.
It appears, from the pleadings and evidence, that, on the
twelfth day of December, 1855, seven hundred boxes of lemons, and two thousand one hundred and fifty boxes of oranges,
together with other merchandise not necessary to be specified,
were shipped on board the brig, then lying at Palermo, and
bound for New York, and that the master signed bills of lading, undertaking to transport the same to New York, and there
deliver the same to the appellant, or his assigns, on payment
of the stipulated freight, the dangers of the seas and the liability of the fruit to decay excepted.
According to the testimony of the master, the brig, with her
cargo on board, sailed from Palermo on the sixteenth day of
the same month, but, while pursuing her voyage, she encountered heavy gales; and on the second day of January following the sea broke over the forward part of the vessel, and carried away the jib-boom, the flying jib-boom, and both topmasts, and they were obliged, in the emergency, to cut away
the rigging, to clear the jib-boom from the vessel, and get rid
of the broken spars. Both topmasts broke off about halfway between the caps and the cross-bars; and they lost in the
disaster the mainsail, the two topsails, the gallant-sail, and the
spanker. Crippled and disabled as the vessel was, she was
obviously incapable of proceeding on her voyage; and, consequently, the master found it necessary to bear away and put
into Lisbon for repairs, which was the nearest port. She

arrived off the bar at that port on the fifteenth of the same
month, and two days later was able to come to anchor in the
roadstead, about a mile from the shore. Vessels arriving at that
port are obliged, as the witnesses state, to anchor in the stream,
because there are no docks or piers in the harbor to which, in
rough weather, they can be moored.

On the following day,

the master applied to the consul for a survey of the vessel, to
estimate damages and cost of repairs, and the survey was ordered on the same day the application was made, but four
days elapsed before the persons appointed to make the survey
were able to go on board, in consequence of the storm, and the
roughness of the sea.
They made their report on the twenty-second day of the
same month, specifying the nature of the repairs required, and
estimating the cost; and on the same day the master of the
brig, after consulting with the consul upon the subject, applied
to him for an examination and survey of the fruit, and it was
immediately ordered. Persons experienced. in the business
were accordingly appointed by the consul for that purpose,
and, on the thirtieth day of the same month they went on
board and made the necessary examination. By their report
it appears that they found the boxes containing the fruit properly stowed in the vessel, and the place of stowage properly
ventilated; but, upon opening a certain number of the boxes,
they ascertained that some of the fruit was rotten, and other
portions of it were beginning to decay. Under those circumstances, the surveyors directed thiat the boxes should be discharged and placed in a well-aired storehouse, until the vessel
could be repaired and made ready to resume her voyage. That
order was carried into effect, and on the ninth day of February
following the surveyors made a second examination of the
boxes, and, finding that the measures previously recommended
and adopted were insufficient to accomplish the object, they
directed that the boxes should. be opened, and. the unsound
fruit entirely separated from that which was sound and fit for
use. Competent and experienced persons were accordingly
designated and employed for that purpose; and the testimony
shows, that in executing the order, they condemned and threw

away as worthless an amount of the fruit equal to four hunured and fourteen boxes. Those persons entered upon the
performance of their duty on the day they were designated,
and on the nineteenth day of the same month the surveyors
by whom they were selected made a report, approving what
they had done for the preservation of the fruit. Throughout
this period the repairs upon the vessel were being executed,
and, on the twenty-fifth day of the same month the surveyors
appointed to examine the brig reported that the repairs were
completed, and that she was in a condition to prosecute her
voyage. Three days afterwards the master executed a bottomry bond to raise money'to defray the expenses incurred in
execditing the repairs and in carrying out the measures rebommended for the preservation of the cargo; and, on the fourth
day of March, 1856, the brig sailed for N~ew York, but in consequence of bad weather she did not arrive at her port of destination until the twentieth day of May following. Much of
the fruit repacked at the port of distress, in the meantime, had
deteriorated, and some of it had become worthless; but it is
not pretended that there was any fault in the stowage, or any
negligence or want of care on the part of the master during
that part of the voyage. On the arrival of the vessel, all of
the fruit, except what had been condemned and thrown away,
as before sated, was duly tendered to the consignee, but he
refused to receive it, claiming that the loss and deterioration
were chargeable to the misconduct of the master at the port
of distress.
1. It is conceded that the injuries received by the brig on
the second of January fully justified the master in bearing
away and running into Lisbon as a port of distress to refit the
vessel and rendering her capable of continuing and prosecuting the voyage. That concession was very properly made,
as the evidence is full to the point and entirely satisfactory.
Fault is not imputed prior to the disaster, either to the master
or owners; and it would seem that the charge could not be
sustained, if made, as the evidence shows that the vessel was
staunch, the cargo properly stowed, and every reasonable precaution taken to give it sufficient ventilation.

DEOEMBER TERM, 1861.

None of these"matters were drawn in question at the argument, but it was insisted by the appellant in the suit against
the vessel, that the repairs were not executed with proper diligence, and that the discharge of that portion of the cargo in
question, and the opening of the boxes and the taking out and
repacking the fruit, were improper and injudicious, and hal
the effect to promote and increase the inherent tendency to
decay. Much testimony was taken on the first point, and in
some of its aspects itis conflicting, but when considered in connection with the circumstances, as explained by the witnesses
who were present and saw the difficulties which occasioned the
delay,k it is quite obvious that the proposition cannot be sustained. Some twenty-five or thirty other vessels put into that
port about the same time for the same purpose, which created
an unusual demand for the labor of mechanics. According to
the statements of the witnesses, the mechanics there were few
in number, and not very efficient; and what added fo the difficulty was, the circumstance that it was the carnival season, and
consequently the mechanics refused to work during the festivals and holidays, which for a time included two or three days
in the week, and on one occasion they "struck" for higher
wages, and refused.to work at all for several days. Among
the vessels that put into the port for repairs at that time were
two bound to New York, and neither of them sailed till after
the brig; and all the witnesses who were on the ground, and
have any knowledge of the actual circumstances, agree substantially that the repairs were made as soon as they could be
in that port at that time. Witnesses, residing in New York,
express the opinion that the repairs might have been executed
in much less time, and their testimony undoubtedly is correct
as applied to any commercial port in the United States; but
the master in this case was obliged to refit his vessel in the port
of distress where she was anchored, and it must be assumed
that those who witnessed his conduct have the best means of
judging with what fidelity he performed his duty.
2. Two vessels only were in port bound to New York, and
both of those were there for the purpose of repairs, and of
course were not in a condition to bring forward the cargo of

the brig. Unable, as the master was, to employ another vessel
and send the cargo forward, it was certainly his duty to take
all possible care to preserve it. Looking at the whole evidence,
it is clear that he sought the best advice that he could obtain,
and- followed it faithfully; and, notwithstanding the opinion
expressed by certain witnesses to the contrary, we are by no
means prepared to admit that he did not pursue a judicious
course to prevent the fruit from perishing. In view of all the
facts and circumstances, we think the point is without merit,
and it is accordingly overruled. 8. Having come to that conclusion, one or two remarks in regard to the suit brought by
the owners of the vessel will be sufficient. They having established the fact that the loss and decay of the fruit were not
occasioned by the fault of the master, were clearly entitled to
recover for the freight on all that portion of the cargo that was
-duly transported and delivered. No question was made as to
the amount in the Circuit Court, and it is not pretended that
the question ought to be opened here in case the other decree
should be affirmed. After a careful consideration of the evidence, we have come to the conclusion that the decision of the
Circuit Court was correct, and the respective decrees are accordingly affirmed, with costs.
