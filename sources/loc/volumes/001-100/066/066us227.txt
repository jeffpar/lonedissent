toms of Mexico consists of a petition with desefio annexed, order
of reference, decree of concession, and copy of the grant.
Where there is no map annexed to the petition, no order of reference,
or inform6, but the decree of concession follows immediately after
the petition, the inference is a reasonable one that no order of reference or inform6 was ever made in that case.
Where the decree of concession appears to have been made without
an informg upon that petition, and yet recites an inform6 as having
been made by a certain alcalde, and that alcalde did actually mak6
an inform upon anotherpetition to a former governor, the presumption is that the recital refers to the inform6 actually made.
If the inform4 was originally adverse to the petitioner, but was altered after the conquest so as to make it a favorable report, and it is
recited in the decree as a favorable report, the inference is that the
decree was not made until after the alteration, and consequently
not until after the conquest of the country.
The fact that an espediente is included in an index made by an Ameri-'
can officer in 1847 and 1848 shows that it was in the archives when
that index was made, but it shows nothing more, The index can.

to show when or by what means they came into the Surveyor General's office, evidence that the grant was recorded is entirely wanting.
'. The fact that a grant bearing date 4th May, 1846, was not sent by
the Governor to the Departmental Assembly for approval among
the others which were so sent on the 3d and 10th of June, is entitled to very considerable weight as a circumstance against the authenticity of the grant.
8. Assuming it to be competent to establish a title without record evidence, still the burden is on the claimant to prove that the grant
was issued, and he cannot give parol evidence of its contents without
first proving its existence and loss.
9. But a claim cannot be confirmed without record evidence.
10. To maintain a title by means of secondary evidence, the claimant
must show that the grant was bbtained and made in the,manner
required by law, and that it was recorded in the proper public
office.
11. Evidence that a book or other record is lost cannot avail a claimant
unless it be also proved that the grant under which the claim in
made was duly and properly entered on the lost record.
This was an appeal by the United States from the decree of
the District Court for the northern district pf California. The
appellee (Morehead) was administrator of Win. Knight, and
in that character he presented his petition on the 3d day of
March, 1852, to the board of commissioners for the investigation of private land claims, agreeably to the act of Congress
passed March 8, 1851. The commissioners rejected the claim,
and the petitioner appealed to the District Court, where it was
confirmed. The claim was for ten leagues (sitios de gaiiada
mayor) of land, situate on the western bank of the Sacramento,
including the region lying between that river and the arroyo
Jesus Maria, and being a large part of what is now the county

of Yolo.

DEOEM3ER TERM, 1861.
United States vs. Knight's .Adm'r.

The first purported to be a petition addressed by William
Knight to the Governor, bearing date at Sonoma, on the 1st
day of February, 1846, describing the land, setting forth the
necessities of his family as a reason for the appropriation of it
to him by the superior authority, and soliciting the concession
in the ordinary form. On the margin of this was written a
short note, "Granted as prayed by the petitioner," with an
order that a title be issued. This was signed "Pico." Immediately following the petition was a formal and very full decree
of concession, dated Angeles, May 4, 1846, to which was attached the full 'name of Pio Pico, with his rubric; and it was
attested by JosJ Matias Miforeno, as secretary. To these documents was added a borrador of a grant, also dated May 4, 1846.
Several lines of this borrador had been written' and a break
made, when the writer (the same, or some other) commenced
again at the beginning and wrote to the end of it. The names
of the Governor and secretary at the foot of the borrador were
admitted not to be in their hands; but Nicholas Den, who had
been a magistrate in California before the conquest, and John
W. Shore, a clerk in the Surveyor General's office, testified
that they were acquainted with the handwriting of Pio Pico,
and believed his signature t(; the marginal order and decree of
concession to be genuine. Moreno himself was also called,
and he swore that he recollected Knight's presentation of his
petition in May, 1846. Te was shown a copy of the espediente,
and said he believed it was a copy of the decree of concession
and of the original grant. The decree he declared was made
and signed by the Governor, and the title was issu&1 and delivered to Knight by himself as secretary, in which occupation
he continued until 1848. But he assigned no dates to the
making of the decree or the issuing of the title, or to the delivery of it, nor did he say that the grant was signed by the
Governor, or recorded in any book, or that the espediente had
been filed in the secretary's office. There was no map, no order of reference to any local magistrate or subordinate officer,
and no inforn in the espediente. But the petition refers to a
map, and the decree of concession, as well as the borrador of
the grant, recites a report from the first alcalde of Sonoma.

SUPREME COURT. â€¢
United States vs. Knight's Adm'r.

These papers were among the espedientes arranged, numbered, and indexed in the years 1847 and 1848 by W. E. P.
Hartnell. Mr. Hartnell was the clerk or assistant of Capt.
Halleck when the latter was secretary for the military government established by Gen. Kearney after the taking of Monterey. Capt. Halleck was a witness in this cause, and deposed
that, besides the records which were brought up from Los Angeles, a large quantity were found lying on the floor of the custom-house at Monterey and piled up against the wall, which
were by himself and Mr. Hartnell placed among the records
of the office. Private individuals also brought papers there
and had them filed, but he or Hartnell always endorsed on
these private papers the time at which they were deposited.
Capt. Halleck's testimony does not disclose his reasons nor
those of Hartnell for believing that the papers found in the
custom-house were land records of the Mexican Government.
To prove the loss of the original grant and excuse its nonproduction, the claimant took the deposition of Samuel Brannon, who testified that in 1847 Knight came to San Francisco
from the lower country, where he had been bearing despatches
for the Government, and that he told the witness of an attempt made (he did not say when or where) by the Sanchezes
(native Californians) to lasso him, in consequence of which,
and of his fast riding to escape them, he had lost his title
papers. But he did not describe or allude to any particular
paper as being lost.
The evidence showed that Knight was a native of the United
States, had gone to New Mexico as early as 1830, where he
had married "a daughter of the country," and emigrated
thence to California .about 1842. In 1843 he seated himself
and his family on the right bank of the Sacramento, at a place
since called "Knight's Landing," and within the limits of this
claim. In that year, or the year after, he built himself a house,
and in 1845 he had a wheat-field of five or six acres under
cultivation. In 1846 he had a garden of two or three acres
rnear his house planted with corn and melons. He left his
home early that summer, was in the Bear Flag insurrection,
and joined the American army soon after its first appearance

on the coast. Hle served during the war, and died in 1849, at
the gold mines on the Stanislaus river.
Knight's relations with the Departmental Government of
California before and after Pico's accession to power were
shown by testimony taken in the cause, and by reference to
historical and official documents. In 1842, very soon after he
came into the country, he solicited Micheltorena for a concession of the same land which is now claimed. His petition was
successively referred to the Prefect of Monterey, the judge of
N'ew Helvetia, and the First Alcalde of Sonoma, the last of
whom reported against him on the ground that the land solicited had been previously conceded to, and was then occupied by, Ddn Thomas Hardy. Micheltorena never gave him
any grant. He joined the standard of that chief in the autumn
of 1844, when his authority was resisted by Pico and his partisans in the south. But he was not included within the terms
of the general title which Micheltorena made to his followers,
through Captain Sutter, at Santa Barbara, on the 22d of December, because he had no report from Sutter, and the report
which he bad from the Alcalde of Sonoma was adverse to him.
Nevertheless Sutter, on the 15th day of April, 1845, gave hini a
copy of the general title, believing him (as he swore) entitled
to the land for his military services underMicheltorena against
Pico, the latter of whom was in power as political chief of the
Department at the time when the copy was so delivered. After
receiving this copy of the general title, and after the conquest
of the country by the Americans, Knight, on the 8th October, 1847, got Jacob P. Leese (who had been the First Alcalde
of Sonoma in 1844) to alter his inform6 by inserting into it the
words "una parte de ella," and procured from Hardy and Leese
certificates that the land solicited by him in 1844 did not interfere with Hardy's ranch, as Leese had then reported. He
sought the advice of seveal friends on the value of this title,
and often incidentally spoke of it to others, but to none of them
did he show or mention any except the Sutter title, unless to
Colonel Fremont,who does not recollect the papers he exhibited
nor the Governor under whose grant he claimed, but "thinks
he rather spoke of Pio Pico." The papers from Micheltucena

SUPREME COURT..
United States vs. Knight's Adm'r.

and Sutter were found in the possession of his family afterbis
death. They knew of no others. The hostility of Knight to
the Pico government was like that of the other American setters in the north-uniform and consistent.. Captain Gillespie
stated in his deposition that the causes of the Bear Flag war
were in operation from the time of Fremont's appearance on
the frontier in March, 1846, and Colonel Fremont himself testified that Knight was prominently engaged in the insurrection
from the beginning, but not ostensibly so, for he was employed
in the month of May as a spy.
Harrison Gwinn deposed to a conversation with,William
McDaniel, (who, at one time, prosecuted this claim,) in which
the latter said that when he took hold of the case there were
no papers, but he had made out as good a set of papers as there
was to any grant of land in California. McDaniel being produced by the claimants, positively contradicted the testimony
of Gwinn. He said that he had seen certain papers at Benicia
with Knight's name upon them, but not being able to read
Spanish, he could make nothing of them.
James M. Harbin swore that Knight was at Los Angeles
three weeks in the spring of 1846, and left there the first week
in May. Ni'cholas Den declared in his deposition that he had
seen him at Santa Barbara in March, April, or May, going to
and returning from Los Angeles. Both these witnesses say that
Knight told them he had received a title from Pio Pico. On
the other hand, Major Bidwell, Captain Sutter, Major Gillespie, Samuel Neal, Colonel Fremont, William Bartee, S. W.
Chase, William Gordon, Nicholas Algier, John Grigsby, testified more or less directly to facts wholly inconsistent with the
probability that he could have been at Los Angeles at the date of
the alleged grant. The unusual height of the waters (they swore)
would have made the journey extremely difficult. The hostile
relations between the government at Los Angeles and the
American settlers on the Sacramento would have made it perilous for one of them to travel in the South, and some of "he
witnesses swore that they knew him to be at home during the
months of April and May. It did not appear that he ever
poke of having made such a journey.

DEOEMBER TERM, 1861.
United, States v i. Knight's Adm'r.

Mr. Slhunlc, of Pennsylvania, for the United States. 1.
Without record evidence this claim cannot be confirmed,
The papers produced by the claimant, and called an espediente, are not recprds. No witness has ever traced them to
the custody of the Mexican officials, who kept the archives of
California before the conquest. They are indexed, it is true,
by Hartnell, who was a translator in the office of the Secretary
of State in 1848. But Hartuell was nothing but an American
clerk, and the fact that he covered these papers with a wrapper, endorsed them as an espediente, gave them a number,
and noted them in an Index, goes no farther to prove them
records than would the like scribbling of any clerk in the Surveyor General's office of our own day. Hartnell's endorsement proves that these papers existed at the time he made his
Index, but nothing more. They bear no official -impress, made
by Mexican hands during the days of the Mexican rule. All
the dignity and value they have they-got from Hartnell, whose
endorsement could not transmute worthless papers into records.
2. Granting them to be records, they do not prove that a
valid title was issued to Knight. There is no order of reference, no inform6, no map. Knight asks for ten leagues of
land; Pico grants it. The papers, if they prove anything,
simply prove that Pico defied the law. Mexican Colonization
Law of 1824; Regulations of 1828; United States vs. Cambuston, (20 How., 59;) United States vs. Fuentes, (22 How., 443.)
3. There is no evidence that any grant was ever delivered
to Knight. Moreno, the secretary, who is the only witness to
this point, is laid out of the case by Judge Hoffman as being
unworthy of belief. Moreover, it is proved that Knight was
not and could not have been in Los Angeles at the time it is'
pretended this grant was delivered.
4. Knight was the most unlikely person in the world to get
such a grant from Pio Pico. He had been an active and open
follower of Micheltorena, and belonged to a class of people
who hated Pico, and were hated by him in return. Only a
year before the date of this pretended grant, he was in arms

SUPREME COURT.
United States vs. Knight's Adm'r.

against Pico, under Micheltorena, and within two weeks after
its date, was in arms against him under Fremont. Pico made
no grant to any adherent of Micheltorena, and to this rule
Kn'ight was the last man to be made an exception.
5. Knight never occupied the land after the date of this
grant in compliance with its terms. He cultivated a few acres
very carelessly, and at long intervals. But he even ceased
this little farming from the date of his grant, and virtually
abandoned the ranch.
6. All Knight's acts and declarations from the date of this
pretended grant to the day of his death are utterly at variance
with the idea that he had any such title. He never claimed
under it, spoke of it, or exhibited it; but claimed under, spoke
of, and often exhibited another title. Even his wife does not
appear ever to have heard of it until after his death.
,fr. Stanton, of Washington city, and Mr. Sunderland, of
California, for the appellee. 1. The espediente is found among
the archives, and bears every mark of genuineness. Tle signatures of the Governor and Secretary are proved to be genuine, and paper, ink, and every mark by which forgery can be
detected, in this case bear comparison with papers in the archives of the same date and of undoubted authenticity. The
fact that the espediente is incomplete is a strong circumstance
in its favor. If manufactured, the papers, in form, would have
been perfect. The grant itself would have been found, or a
new one made from the copy on file.
2. This espediente was in the archives early in 1847, as is
shown by Hartnell's Index, and by the testimony of Halleck
in relation to the method of making that Index. It would
have been difficult and almost impossible to introduce papers
into the archives by stealth while they were in the custody of
Halleck and Hartuell, and where documents were deposited by
private persons the fact and date of such deposit were endorsed
upon them at the time. The papers in this case bear no such
,indorsement. -The Hartnell Index is a document of high an.nority. Mr. Hartnell was a man of unquestionable integrity,

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.

United States vs. Knight's Adm'r.

an accomplished Spanish scholar, and no man in California,
with the exception of his brother-in-law Jimeno, was betei
acquainted with the Mexican laws and Mexican records.
3. It is not unlikely that Pio Pico would have made a grant
to Knight on the 4th of May, 1846, but very improbable that
he would have made one after that time. Knight had married
a Mexican woman, was almost a Mexican himself, and had frequently been employed by the Government. Pico was, therefore, likely to conciliate him and endeavor to secure his friendship by a grant,. in view of the difficulties which surrounded
the Government in May, 1846. After Knight had joined the
Bear Flag and helped to drive Pico out of the country, the
idea that he would reward him with an ante-dated grant for
these services against himself is preposterous. Moreover, Pico
and Knight never met after May, 1846. Knight never had access to the archives after the time when he might have got a
grant from Mexico if Pico had sent him one; nor did he introduce the espediente in this case among the archives, because
he never referred to it. Having lost his grant, he seemed ignorant to the last that there was any record which might serve
him in its stead. The opponents of the claim ought to present
some theory of their own to show when, by whom, and how
the grant was made, if not made as the claimant alleges.
4. The delivery of the grant is proved by Moreno, and the
fact that Knight was in Los Angeles on the 4th of May, 1846,
by Harbin. Den saw him on his way there and back, and
Davis saw him at the "Buttes" on his return. Moreno, unfortunately for many honest claimants whose grants lie attested,
is unworthy of belief. But in this case he is fully corroborated.
5. The attempt of the Government to prove that Knight was
at home at the date of his grant, and could not have made the
journey to Los Angeles on account of the floods, is a failure.
Those witnesses who swear that he was at home in May fix the
time by circumstances which have no connection with the year
1846, and may have happened just as well in 1847. The rest
contradict each other and themselves. The testimony touching the floods avails nothing, for Knight went by the coast
route, which was open beyond dispute. The alleged hostility

SUPREME COURT.
United States vs. Knight's Admr.

of the Californians to the American settlers is equally futile as
an argument. Knight was a -bold and skilful horseman, knew
everybody on the road, and carried an unerring rifle. To such
a man the dangers of the journey were as nothing.
6. The loss of the original grant is proved by the deposition
of Samuel Brannan, to whom Knight told the fact immediately
after it occurred, and told it under circumstances which confirmed .the truth of his statement.
7. Knight did repeatedly speak of his grant from Pico. lie
mentioned it to Colonel Fremont, to Davis at .the Buttes when
he came into the camp, to Harbin at Los Argeles when he got
it, and to Den at Santa Barbara on his return home. His
omission to speak of it to other witnesses with whom he conversed on the subject after the spring of 1847 is easily explained.
He had then lost the grant; he did not know of the espediente
in the office, and thought he had no other resource but to fall
back on the Micheltorena papers.
Mr. Black, of Pennsylvania, in reply. The United States
are not bound to explain how or by whom the fraud was concocted or executed. It is sufficient that we show the theory
of the claimant to be false. United States vs. Luco, (23 How.,
515.)
Knight's silence concerning a title from Pico can be accounted for in only one of three ways: (1,) The papers must
have been fabricated after his death; or, (2,) before his death,
without his knowledge; or, (3,) if they existed in his lifetime,
and he knew it, he must also have known that they were
false, and was therefore afraid to speak of them, lest he should
provoke an inquiry which might result in his detection or exposure.
The mere occupancy of land, without a grant from the nation, gives no title under the Mexican law. It is true that
where the record of the grant is lost, and the claimant is driven
to secondary evidence, the fact of occupancy, with boundaries
marked by the proper officers and permanentimprovementsin
the face of the Mexican authorities, may be strong evidence in
aid of the presumption that the title was originally regular.

DEOEMBER TE,M, 1861.

287

United States vs. Knight's Adm'r.

United States vs. Josg Castro, (24 How., 846;) United Staies vs.
Teschmalcer, (22 Hlow., 392.) But where a party comes into court
with a grant which he cannot prove, orwhere he produces one
which, on examination, turns out to be spurious or void, there
the occupancy of the claimant only shows that he was dishonestly trying to possess himself of that which was not his own.
This case, like others of the same class, must turn on the
question of title.
Did Knight obtain a grant from Pico on the 4th of May,
1846 ? If he did, and if he has proved it' by evidence from
the Mexican records, then there is an end of this controversy;
for such evidence is and ought to be conclusive. But these
papers have no pretensions to be regarded as records. It is
true they are now in the Surveyor General's office, and may
have been there as early as 1848, when Mr. Hartnell finished
making his Index. That shows only that they were not forged
since 1848. They exist now in the office, and existed when
they were first seen there, merely as loose papers, not recorded
or numbered, and wholly unconnected with any other papers
or books which are known to be records. The mere fact that
a loose paper is found in a public office does not give to that
paper the dignity or entitle it to the faith of a ppblic record
without some evidence, intrinsic or extrinsic, to show that it
is properly a part of the records. Besides, Captain Halleck's
testimony in this case shows that there are many papers now
inthe Surveyor General's office which never had a place among
the Mexican archives. All the real records of land titles are
known to have been in the Secretary's office at Los Angeles
when the country was taken by the American army. But
Captain Halleck lets us know that he and Mr. ]Hartnell and
General Kearney mingled with them a large quantity of other
papers found in the custom-house at Monterey, and that their
bulk was further swelled by private contributions. It is notorious, too, that many false papers were placed among them at
different times by dishonest claimants, for their own fraudu.
lent ends. It is impossible, therefore, to tell whether a loose
paper found in the Surveyor General's office comes from the
sweepings of the c'ustom-house floor, from the documents

SUPREME COURT.
United States vs. Knight's Adm'r.

openly deposited by private persons, or from the felonious
droppings of those who fabricated them. Limantour's papers
were found in a public office. Benito Diaz had his, by some
means, placed in the Surveyor General's office. Francisco
Pico's espediente was found there; and Osio appealed, like the
present claimant, to what he called "the archives." But those
men have been gibbeted in the face of the world as the fabricators of false titles.
Jimeno's Index is a catalogue of genuine espedientes, made
before the conquest, by a Mexican officer, who had the means
of knowing, and did know, the false from the true. Hartnell's
is a list in which the genuine are mingled and confused with
the fabricated by an American clerk, who knew not how to
distinguish the one from the other. It and its author are alike
unworthy of the eulogy pronounced on them by the learned
counsel for the claimant. Mr. Hartnell could read, write and
speak Spanish. That was his sole qualification. lie knew
nothing of Mexican laws or records. He was wholly without
experience, and the egregious blunder he committed in taking
the false papers at the custom-house for land records, shows
that he was utterly destitute of judgment.
The journals of the Departmental Assembly prove that this
pretended espediente did not exist as a Mexican record. If it
had, it would have been included in the forty-five sent into that
body on the 8th of June, 1846. There is no reason to believe
that any unapproved grant then in the office was withheld by
the Governor. United States vs. Bolton, (23 liow.)
No living witness pretends to have seen these papers among
the records in the Secretary's office. Pico was not called at
all, and Moreno was not asked a, question on the subject.
These papers, then, are not records, and that brings the case
to a close; for, as a record, if the claimant had one, would be
conclusive in his favor, so the want of a record is conclusive
against him. This court has pledged itself to confirm no California title on anything short of record evidence.
But it may be worth while to look at the parol evidence in
the cause, for the mere purpose of vindicating the wisdom of
the rule which excludes it altogether.

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.

239

United States vs. Knig it's Adm'r.

Conceding, for the argument's sake, that a public grant for
ten leagues of land may be proved by any kind of evidence
which will produce a moral conviction on the mind of an impartial judge that the fact is true, how much ought to be required in a case like this? There are several considerations
which must be borne in mind here:
1. This belongs to a very suspicious class of California land
grants. It bears the name of Pio Pico, and is dated on the
eve of the conquest. In Cambuston's case the court said that
all grants of that kind should be carefully scrutinized. They
have been so scrutinized, and not one of them has stood the
test. Of nine grants bearing that name, and dated between
December, 1845, and July, 1846, and contested here on the
ground of fraud, not one has been confirmed. Outside of the
forty-five confirmed by the Departmental Assembly this court
has never seen a genuine grant of Pio Pico. It will be remembered that Dalton's title was dated the first year of Pico's
administration; was found recorded in the Toma de Razon;
was among the forty-five, and was admitted to be genuine.
2. Knight was an American settler on the Sacramento, thoroughly identified with the other settflrs there, and actively engaged with them in all their movements, political and military,
before and at the time, and immediately after the date of this
pretended grant. Between Pico's government and the chiefs
of his party on the one hand, and those settlers on the other,
there was no. sentiment but that of bitter hostility. Three
times within the space of eighteen months they confronted one
another with arms in their hands. The enmity was intensified
in March, 1846, by the-appearance of Fremont on the frontier,
and the readiness of every American (Knight among the number) to join him. At the date 6f this decree of concession,
Knight was in actual rebellion against the authority of the
Governor, whose name is signed to it.
2. There are many and obvious marks of falsehood upon
the face of the papers. There is no map. The want of an
informe is a fatal objection in law to the validity of the grant,
and it is also a strong circumstance to show that the whole
title is a fabrication. Would Pico have made a grant to a per-

SUPREME COURT.
United States vs. Knight's Adm'r.
I

son in such relations with his government without the usual
investigations ? The recital of an inform6 is manifestly false.
The inform4 is not on the back of the petition. Suppose it to
have been written on a detached paper, it should be in the espediente. If it was lost, its loss might have been proved. The
Alcalde who made it might have been called. In the absence
of such proof the court is bound to believe it never existed.
To establish the honesty and good faith of the title in the
face of this strong circumstantial evidence against it will require clear evidence, overwhelming in amount, free from serious contradiction, and perfectly pure in the source from
whence it comes. And what have they produced to show the
execution, the delivery, or the recording of the grant?
Covarrubias proves nothing about it. Den and Shore swear
only to their opinion of the handwriting, which this court has
declared to be inadmissible. The whole weight of the case
rests upon Moreno. The value of his testimony need not be
discussed, for the counsel of the claimant candidly admit him
â€¢to be unworthy of belief. There is no other evidence that the
grant was executed, delivered, or recorded. If Den and Hlar
bin were believed, it wo ld only show that it was possible for
Knight to have got a grant in May, 1846. Shall the mere
naked possibility that be might have got a grant, stand for
proof that he did actually get one?
But even this possibility is swept away from the claimant by
the powerful and irresistible proof that Knight was not at Los
Angeles, but at home in the valley of the Sacramento, during
the whole spring.
If such a grant was ever delivered to Knight, why is it not
produced? There is no scintilla of evidence to show its loss.
Brannan proves only that Knight told him he had lost his title
papers. This declaration is not evidence of the fact declared;
much less does it prove the loss of a particular paper, which
was not mentioned. That he lost any papers at all must be
untrue, for all the title papers he ever had or ever pretended
to have were found safe in the custody of his wife, after his
death.
This case has all the bad features in it of the worst cases

that ever came from California. Like Santillan, the claimant
asserted his right to the land under a different title from that
now set up; like Luco, he is without record evidence; and like
Diaz, he is met by a clearly proved alibi.
If the claimants had been content to rest the cause upon the
papers alone, the claim would have been rejected, not as a manifest forgery, but on the ground of insufficient, illegal, and unsatisfactory proof. But they chose to name the, place and the
time at which the grant was delivered to Knight-at Los Angeles, on the 4th of May, 1846-and they called Den and Harbin to prove it. This gave to the Government the opportunity
of demonstrating the .falsehood of the whole story by showing
that Knight was not there, but seven hundred miles away, at the
time. There cannot be an earthly doubt that the papers are
fabricated.
Mr. Jtstice CLIFFORD. This was a petition for the con
firmation of a land claim under the act of the third of March,
1851, and the case comes before the court on appeal from -a
decree of the District Court of the United States for the northern district of California, reversing the decree of the commissioners, and confirming the claim. William Knight died in
October, 1849, and, of course, never presented any claim under that law for confirmation. Administration on his estate
was granted to the appellee on the sixth day of iNovember,
1851, and, on the third day of March following, he, as such
administrator, filed a petition before the commissioners, claiming a tract of land, called Carmel, situated on the borders of
the Sacramento river, and containing ten square leagues. Said
tract, as the petitioner represented, was granted to his intestate on the fourth day of May, 1846, by Governor Pio Pico,
in the name of the Mexican nation; and was afterwards, during the lifetime of the decedent, possessed and occupied by
him pursuant to the grant under which the claim is made.
Copies of certain documentary evidences of title were also presented and filed at the same time, and the petitioner represented in effect that he relied on those documents, and such other
evidence as he might be able to obtain, to show that the claim

ought to be confirmed. Assuming that the theory of claimant
is correct, the title is one, undoubtedly, that ought to be protected; but it is denied by the United States that any such
grant was ever made, and that is the principal question in the
case. Vacant lands in California belonged to the Supreme
Government, and the laws for the disposition of the same
emanated from that source. General rules and regulations upon the subject were accordingly ordained, authorizing the Governors of Territories, under certain specified conditions, togrant
such lands to such empresarios, families, and single persons.as
might ask for the same for the purpose of settlement and cultivation; but it was expressly provided that grants made to
families or single persons should not be held to be definitively
valid, without the previous consent of the territorial deputation. ,By those rules and regulations, every person soliciting
such lands was required, in the first place, to address a petition
to the Governor setting forth his name, country, profession, and
religion, and also to describe the land asked for as distinctly
as possible, by means of a disefio or map, which is usually annexed to the petition. iHe was not required to prove his representations, but it was made the duty of the Governor to obtain the necessary information to enable him to determine
whether the case, as presented in the petition, fell within the
conditions specified in the regulations, both as regarded the
land and the applicant. Petitions and grants, with the maps
of the land granted, were required to be recorded in a book
kept for that purpose, and a circumstantial account of the adjudications was directed to be forwarded quarterly to the Supreme Government. To bring the claim within these rules,
the claimant introduced the following documents before the
commissioners:
1. A petition, in the usual form, signed by his ,intestate,
bearing date It Sonoma, on the first day of February, 1846,
and addressed to Governor Pio Pico.
Recurring to the material parts of the instrument, it will be
seen, that the petitioner asked the Governor to grant him "the
tract set out in the annexed map," meaning the map annexed
to the petition, containing tea sitios de gafiada mayor, more

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.
United State vs. Knight's Adm'r.

or less; and after describing the tract, and giving the out,
boundaries of the same, stated that, according to the annexed
report of the magistrate of Sonoma, "there seems to be no
obstacle on the part of any one to its concession." No such
map, however, as that referred to was annexed to the petition
at the time it was introduced; and the espediente contained
no report of the Alcalde of Sonoma, or of any other such
magistrate.
2. Two decrees, signed by Governor Pio Pico, both dated
Aigeles, May 4th, 1846, were also introduced by the claimant.
One was written, as usual, in the margin of the petition, and
was as follows: "Granted, as prayed by the petitioner. Let
the title be issued by the Secretary of the Department." But
the other, which is signed also by the Secretary, was appended
to the petition, without any intervening inform6, or order for
the same; andyet the recitals of the decree plainly importthat
the action of the Governor, in making it, was based not only
upon the petition, but also upon a report of the Alcalde of the
district, as set forth in the petition. Like the preceding decree, it directs that a proper title be issued to the petitioner;
and, also, that the espediente be kept, to be submitted to the
Departmental Assembly.
He also introduced another document, which was appended
to the last named decree, and which purports to be a copy of
the "titulo" or grant on which the claim is based. It is dated
at the city of Los Angeles, on the fourth day of May, 1846, and
is in the usual form.
Failing to produce the original grant, the administrator introduced his own affidavit, to show that he had made diligent
search for the same among the papers of-the deceased, and

elsewhere, and that he was unable to find it. Three witnesses
were examined by the claimant before the commissioners; but
the commissioners rejected the claim, and the claimant appealed to the District Court. Testimony was taken on both
sides in the District Court, and the claimant also introduced
certain additional documentary evidences which it becomes
important to notice.

SUPREME COURT.
United States vs. Knight's Adm'r.

Nearly three years before the petition was presented to Gov.
ernor Pio Pico, the same party, as appears by these documents,
had presented a similar petition to Manuel Micheltorena, then
holding the office of Governor of California, asking for a grant
of the same tract of land. This petition, as then presented,
was dated at Monterey on the eighth day of May, 1843, and on
the same day the Governor referred it to the Prefect of the
district for a report. John A. Sutter was at that time the principal civil officer in that section of the department, aid the
Prefect accordingly referred the petition to him, directing him
to furnish the necessary information; but he referred it to the
Alcalde or justice of the peace of Sonoma, for the reason, as
stated, that the land was in that district. On the twenty-sixth
day of January, 1844, the last named officer reported, to the
effect that the land solicited was occupied by virtue of a concession from the Governor in favor of another individual.
That report was duly transmitted to the Governor; and, on
the twenty-seventh day of March following, he referred the
whole case to Manuel Jimeno, who, oil the same day, made a
report, recommending that the petition in question, and all
similar cases, should be suspended, until the Governor could
visit that frontier. Here the matter dropped; and, for reasons
which will presently appear, the jetition was never again considered.
Certain prominent persons belonging to the department, of
whom Pio Pico was one, in the fall of 1844, revolted against
the authority of Micheltorena; but John A. Sutter supported
the constitutional governor, and was sent by him to collect the
militia of the northern frontier, to put down the rebellion.
Some of the adherents of the latter had certain claims to lands,
and he suggested to the Governor, in the emergency, that grants
should be made to them, probably as the most available means
to secure their services. Pursuant to that suggestion, the Governor sent to that officer the document known as the "Sutter
general title," promising grants to all such claimants as had
previously obtained from him a favorable report. According
to the testimony of Sutter, the claimant's intestate was prop.

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.

245-

erly included in that category; and he accordingly, on the fifteenth day of April, 1845, gave him the copy of that document,
which is exhibited in this record.
Such is the substance of the documentary evidences of title
introduced by the claimant. All those relating to the proceedings on the petition presented to Micheltorena, together
with the copy of the Sutter general title, were found among
the papers of the deceased; but those appertaining to the Pi
Pico espediente, exceptthe alleged copy of the grant, are traced
copies of originals, now on file in the office of 'the Surveyor
General of California.
It is not pretended that the Sutter general title has any validity, or that the claim in this case can be upheld by the proceedings that took place on the first named petition. Such
preten*sions, if made, could not be supported, as this court has
determined, on several occasions, that the former was invalid;
and it is quite obvious that nothing was done by Governor
Micheltorena to give any pretence of title whatever to the
claimant's intestate.
But it is insisted that the parol proofs, taken in connection
with the espediente of 1846, clearly show that Pio Pico, on the
fourth day of May in that year, actually issued the grant to
William Knight; and that, having proved its execution, delivery, and loss, the claimant is entitled to. introduce secondary
evidence, to show its contents. Great reliance is placed upon
the espediente, as furnishing a ground of presumption that the
grant was issued; and, indeed, it is contended, that if it appears
that the espediente is genuine, then the grant must be confirmed. Whether the proposition, as stated, be correct or not,
it may properly be admitted that the question, as to the bona
tdes of the espediente, is one of very considerable importance
in the case. When complete, an espediente usually consists
of the petition, with the disefio annexed; a marginal decree,
approving the petition; the order of reference to the proper
officer, for information; the report of that officer, in conformity to the order, the decree of concession, and the copy or a
duplicate of the grant. These several papers--that is, the petition, with the diseffo annexed, the order of reference, the

246

SUPREME COURT.
'UnitedStates vs. Knigts Adm'r.

inform6, the decree of concession, and the copy of the grant,
appended together in the order mentioned-constitute a complete espediente, within the meaning of the Mexican law.
Three defects are obvious in the document exhibited in the
record. There is no map annexed to the petition, and there is
neither an order of reference nor an inform6; and the inference
from the fact that the decree of concession immediately follows the petition is a reasonable one, that no order of reference
or report were ever made.
Those defects, however, are by no means the principal circumstances that tend to create distrust as to its genuineness.
Much graver difficulties than any suggested by the defects of
the document arise, from what appears affirmatively, on its
face. Both the petition and the decree of concession refer to
the report of the Alcalde of Sonoma; and the language of the
latter plainly imports that it was founded, in part at least, upon
a report of that magistrate. No such report, so far as appears,
.was made by that officer, in connection with the espediente
under consideration. He never made but one report, and that,
as clearly appears, was adverse to the application, and was
made to Micheltorena on the twenty-sixth day of January,
1844, in which he stated that the land solicited was ocoupied
by virtue of a concession from the Governor in favor of another
individual.
Looking at the terms of the report, it is clear that it is not
to that report, as originally framed, that reference is made,
either in the petition or the decree of concession. On the contrary, it is evident that they both refer to a favorable report,
land not to one that was adverse, which entirely negatives the
theory that the inform4 previously made and on file was carried into this espediente. To suppose that the Governor referred to an informb that never had any existence, is a theory
that cannot be adopted, as it would impute to him an inconsistency little better than afraud upon the Government. Some
other theory, therefore, must be adopted, to explain the transaction. Referring to the record, it appears that Jacob P. Leese
was the Alcalde who made that report, and he was examined
as a witness in behalf of the United States. He testified that

N" DECEIvIBER TERM, 1861.

247

United States vs. Knight's Adm'r.

the words una parte de ello, translated, a part of it, now appearing at the close of the report, were inserted by him on the eighth
day of October, 1847, at the solicitation of the claimant's intestate. That alteration in the inform6 was made, as he states,
in the presence of the individual who, according to his original
report, was in the occupation of the land by virtue of a concession from the Governor. Two certificates were also introduced by the claimant, which go very far to confirm the statements of the witness, both as to the time when the addition
was made to the inform6, and the attending circumstances.
One of those certificates is signed by the witness himself, in
which, after referring to the inform6, he states, in effect,.that
he has discovered, since he made that report, that the statement therein made, that the land was occupied by another individual, was erroneous; and the other certificate is signed by
the person referred to in the inform6 as the occupant of the land;
and he certifies that the land solicited, if "regulated to the
plan," would not interfere with his possession. These certificates bear date on the eighth day of October, 1847, and the witness testifies that he made the alteration in the informe at the
time he gave that certificate. Micheltorena was driven from
power in 1845, and on the tenth day of August, 1846, Pio Pico
fled from the city of Los Angeles, and never afterwards had
possession of the archives or records of the department. Before his flight, he placed them in boxes, and deposited them
with Luis Vignes for safe-keeping. On the thirteenth of that
month, Commodore Stockton entered the city of Los Angeles,
and on the next day Colonel Fremont took possession of the
archives, and kept them until the eighth day of September following, and then took them to Sutter's fort, on the American.
river, where they remainjed until 1847, -when they were sent to
Monterey. They remained at Monterey until February, 1850,
when they were sent to Benicia, and thence to the office of
the Surveyor General. Whatevor might have been the motive
for making the alteration in the inform6, it is clear that it could
not have been done to influence the official action of the Governor, for he had long before gone gut of office; and yet the
circumstances strongly support the hypothesis that it was to

. SUPlEME COURT.
United States vs. Knight's Adm'r.

that same report, as altered on the eighth day of October, 1847,
that the reference is made, both in the petition and the decree
of concession embraced in the espediente. Assuming that to
be so, then it is clear that the espediente is ante-dated and
fraudulent; and the circumstances, when taken together, tend
so strongly in that direction, that we think the espediente is
not entitled to much weight. When the jurisdiction of that
department was transferred to the United States, the motive
to fabricate titles to real property became strong and active,
and the evidence in this case is abundantly suicient to show
that opportunities occurred to enable the unscrupulous to foist
simulated evidences of such titles into the depositories of the
archives, after they were seized at Los Angeles, in spite of any
vigilance that those intrusted with their safe-keeping could
possibly employ to preserve them from such fraudulent practices. Interested parties were necessarily allowed to consult
the contents of the packages while they yet remained in very
considerable disorder, and without any permanent custodian.
Among those who had such opportunities was one of the witnesses of the claimant, and the evidence tends to show that
he had an interest in the. claim, and that he had stated that
when he took hold of it there were no papers in the case, but
that he had procured a set as good as any that could be found
in the State. True it is that he denies ever -having made that
statement; but he admits that he went to Benicia in 1850, and
that he examined the archives for the purpose of ascertaining
whether any grant had been made to the claimant's intestate.
He says he saw papers there with the name of William Knight
on them, but neither he nor the clerks in charge of them could
translate them. Whether the espediente in this case was in
the boxes that fell into the possession of Colonel Fremont at
Los Angeles, orwas among the loose papers subsequ ently found
in the custom-house at Monterey, or when or by what means
the espediente was deposited in the archives, does not appear,
except that it was there in 1847, or the first part of the year
1848, when an officer of the United States, in charge of the
archives, made and completed an index of certain espedientes,
not previously indexed, numbered, or filed, by Mexican au-

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.

,249

United States vs. Knights Adm'r.

thority. Sixty-seven, including all those found in the customhouse at Monterey, were then added to the previous list. Mexican numbering stopped at five hundred and twelve, and the
author of the new index commenced to number where the other
closed. That index includes the espediente in this case as
number five hundred and fifty, and it shows that the espediente was in the archives when that index was made; but it
shows nothing more, and cannot in any sense be regarded as
a Mexican record. Evidence to show that the grant was recorded is entirely wanting; and there is no pretence that the
espediente was ever submitted to the Departmental Assembly
for its approval. Absence of such approval, under the circumstances of this case, is entitled to very considerable weight.
More than forty espedientes were presented to that assembly
on the third and tenth days of June, 1846, and received its approval. Several of the grants were dated in April, 1846,, and
one was dated on the first day of May of that year, and the inference is a reasonable one, that if the espediente in this case
had really been completed, and the grant actually issued, the
former would have been included in that list. Taken together,
these various considerations throw great distrust upon this
docliment, and justify the conclusion that it is entitled to little
or no weight. Rejecting the espediente as unsatisfactory and
wholly insufficient, under the circumstances, nothing remains
to support the claimin this case except the parol proof. Olaimant's theory is, that the grant was issued-by Governor Pio Pico
at Los Angeles on the fourth day of May, 1846, and was then
and there delivered to his intestate. At that time William
Knight lived in the valley of the Sacramento, some seven
hundred miles distant from the seat of Government, where it
is assumed that the grant was issued; but it is insisted that
he visited that place the last of April. or early in May of that
year, and that the grant was delivered to him in person by the
Secretary of the Department. Jos6 M. Moreno was the Secretary at that time, and he testifies that the grant was issued by
the Governor on that day, and that he, the Secretary, delivered
the same to the claimant's intestate. But it is a sufficient
answer to the testimony of that witness to say, that it is con-

United States vs. Knigit's Adm'r.

ceded by the claimant, that his character for truth is worthless.
Another witness, James M. Harbin, testifies, that he saw
William Knight in Los Angeles about that time, and that he
said he was there for the purpose of getting a grant for ten
leagues of land on the Sacramento river; that Governor Pio
Pico told him that lie had issued the grant, and that he, the
witness, saw papers in the possession of Knight when he started
to return, but did not know what they were. Proof was also
introduced by the claimant to show that the signatures to the
marginal decree and the decree of concession were genuine;
and he also introduced an affidavit of J. C. Davis, in which
the affiant states that, on the 5th day of June, 1846, he heard
]Knight say, in the camp of Colonel Fremont, that he had just
returned from the lower country, where he had procured his
title papers; and the affiant also stated that he exhibited certain papers, calling them title papers, but the witness did not
examine them, because he could not read the language. Other
declarations of Knight were also introduced without objection-such as, that he, at one time, said he was going to Los
Angeles, concerning the title to his land, and that, on his return, he. said he had received it; and that, in March, 1847, he
said he had lost his grant, and expressed his fears that he
should lose his land in consequence of the loss of the grant.
It was denied by the United States that he made any such
visit to Los Angeles as is alleged; and they also insisted that
he never claimed to have any other title to the land than the
copy of the general title, which was furnished him on the fifteenth day of April, 1845; and a large number of witnesses
were examined to establish these points. They prove that,
whenever he spoke of having a title to the land, he uniformly
spoke either in vague terms, or else referred directly to the
general title, and never, in a single instance, declared that he
had a grant of the land from the last-named Governor. They
also prove that he was at home during the winter and spring
of that year, and that in the month of April he was engaged,
to some extent, in agricultural pursuits. One witness states,
that he saw him :n his ranch about the eighteenth or twen.

tieth of that month; and another, that he saw him at his house
about the first of May of the same year, and states the circumstances that enable him to fix the tijue with certainty. Two other
witnesses, one a boarder in his house, and the other a neighbor, state, with great positiveness, that he was at home in the
early part of May, sometimes hunting and sometimes farming.
until he joined Colonel Fremont on the twenty-sixth day of
that month. Testimony was also introduced by the United
States, showing that great difficulties would have attended
such a journey at that season of the year, on account of the
swollen state of the streams and the condition of the roads;
and some of the witnesses,. who were well acquainted with the
usual route, express the opinion that the journey, in the ordinary course of travelling, could not have been accomplished
short of a month. These and many other facts were given in
evidence to show that he did not visit Los Angeles at the time
alleged; and clearly the weight of the evidence, to say nothing
of the improbability that the Governor would bestow such a
bounty upon one so recently in arms against him, is clearly
against the theory set up by the claimant. Suppose it were
competent for the appellee to prove his claim without record
evidence, still the burden is upon him to show that the grant
was issued; and surely he must first show its existence and
loss before he can be allowed to give secondary evidence of
its contents. Applying that elementary rule to the facts of
this case, and it is clear that the claimant has no standing in
court. But a more decisive answer to the claim remains to be
stated, and that is, that there is no record evidence that the
grant was ever issued, and without such evidence the claim
cannot be confirmed. That rule is founded upon the Mexican
law, and has been so repeatedly announced by this court that
it seems unnecessary to adduce any argument in its support.
To maintain a title by secondary evidence, say the court, in
United States vs. Castro et al., (24 How., 350,) the claimant
must show that the grant was obtained and made in the manner the law required, at some former time, and that it was recorded in the proper public office; to which it may be added,
that such was undoubtedly the Mexican law, and that the rule

there laid down is plainly applicable to the present case. Similar
views have been expressed by this court on so many pccasions
that it would be a work of supererogation to do more than to
refer to the decided cases. United States vs. Teschmalcer, (22

Evidence was also introduced by the claimant tending to
prove that a book of records appertaining to land titles in
California, for the year 1846, was lost; but no attempt was
made to show that the grant in question was ever recorded in
that book. All we think it necessary to say upon that subject
at the present time is, that proof of such a loss cannot avail a
party in a case like the present, unless it also be shown, at
least by circumstances which will justify the court in finding
the fact, that the grant was duly and properly entered in the
lost record. In view of the whole case, we are of the opinion
that the District Court erred in confirming the claim. The
decree must accordingly be reversed, and the cause remanded,
with directions to dismiss the petition.
