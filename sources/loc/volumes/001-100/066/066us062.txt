Claimants; Brady, Libellant.
A steamer having a coal-barge in tow was navigated so carelessly or unskilfully that the barge was in danger of striking a sloop lying fast at
a dock. The sloop, to prevent the collision, put out a fender, by which
the barge was so injured that she filled and sunk: Held1. That the owner of the barge was entitled to recover from the steamer
for the loss of his vessel and cargo.
2. The putting out of th&fender for such a purpose was no fault on the
part of the sloop.
3. If there had been a fault, from the kind of fender used, the steamer
would nevertheless be responsible.
4. The rule is, that when property is injured by two co-operating causes,
though the persons producing them may not be in intentional concert, the owner is entitled to compensation from either or both, according to the circumstances.
5. Especially is the injured party entitled to recover from that one of the
two who has undertaken to convey the property with care and skill
to a place of destination, but has failed to do so.
Patrick F. Brady filed his libel against the steamer New
Philadelphia, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, in the District
Court of the United States for the southern district of New
York, in a case of collision, civil and maritime, alleging that
he, the libellant, was owner of the coal barge Owen Gorman,

which was taken by the New Philadelphia to be towed to and
left at a certain place in New York harbor; but, owing to the
unskilfulness with which the steamer was navigated, a cowsion occurred between the coal barge and a schooner lying at
one of the docks, by which the barge was sunk.
Process was duly issued, and the New Philadelphia attached.
The Camden and Amboy Railroad and Transportation Company intervened, and made claim to the vessel, as owners
thereof. The proper stipulation being filed on the same day,
the vessel was discharged, and the claimants put in an answer
denying the material facts set forth in the libel.
The District Court, after hearing a great number of witnesses, dismissed the libel for the following reasons, given by
BETTS, 5.:

"The steam-tug New Philadelphia, employed in towing
barges and vessels of various classes between New Brunswick
and New York, through the Raritan river and across New
York bay, had in towage the barge Owen Gorman, loaded
with coal, to be taken from New Brunswick and landed at the
foot of 26th street, on the East river. She had nine other vessels in the same tow, which were destined to different landing
points on the North and East rivers, and also at docks and
piers on the Brooklyn side. The Owen Gorman was to be
left by the tug at Washington street, Brooklyn (Williamsburg.) In making the course round from the North river, the
tug stopped and landed a barge at the Atlantic docks, Brooklyn shore, and in so doing the Owen Gorman was brought
against a small sloop, moored at that dock. So soon as that
barge was discharged the tow proceeded to Washington street,
where within an hour the Owen Gorman was brought up to a
pier by the tug, and was there cast off and left, the tug proceeding immediately after to her place of destination. After
she was discharged and the tug was clear of her, and on her
way to 26th street, the barge was found leaking rapidly, and
during the effort made by those in charge of her to haul her
into the slip and prevent her from sinking, she filled by water
running through holes or breaks in her starboard side, and
went down in deep water, and was afterwards raised, with con-

siderable cost and loss to the libellant both in respect to vessel
and cargo.
"This action charges the damages the owner incurred to the
fault of the tug in causing the Owen Gorman to be brought
into collision with the sloop at the Atlantic docks, at the time
of landing a barge at that place in her transit round to Washington street. The injury was not discovered until she had
been left at the latter place, and the men were endeavoring to
haul her in.
"The testimony fastens no blame upon the tug in the manner
the landing of the barge was effected at Washington street.
The allegations of tort in the tug by the libel, and the evidence
in the support of the charge, all rest upon the assumption that
the wrongful act and collision committed by the tug consisted
in bringing the Owen Gorman against the side of the sloop at
the Atlantic dock; and if that charge is not supported, the
libellat has no ground of action before the court.
"It is unnecessary to go into a detail of the particulars of
that transaction or the representations of the various witnesses
in respect to it, as, in my opinion, the eviden& does not justify
imputing to that cause the injury which the barge received, and
which led to her sinking. Over twenty witnesses were examined and re-examined with great fullness as to the facts and
circumstances attendant upon the transaction; and, in my
judgment, the clear weight of proof is, that the damage to the
barge which caused her sinking and all subsequent expenses
was received after she left charge of the tug at Washington
street, and that it does not come within the scope of the present
complaint. A minute collation and review of this mass of evidence would be a profitless labor, as no legal principle or
doubt is involved in its admissibility or import. It is solely
a question as to which class of witnesses had the best means
of knowing the facts, and under all the circumstances is most
to be relied upon in their statements.
"My opinion is, that the claimants have succeeded in showing that the tug was not the culpable agent of the damages
sustained by the libellant, and the libel must accordingly be
dismissed with costs."

From this decision of the District Court an appeal was
taken to the Circuit Court, whereit was reversed, and a decree made that the libellant recover. It was referred to a com
missioner, who reported the amount of the damages suffered
by the libellant to be $3,159 34. To this report various exceptions were taken, some of which were sustained, and others
overruled, so that the damages were reduced to $2,898 84, for
which latter sum it was decreed the libellant should have execution. The claimants then took their appeal to this court.
Mr. Murray, for libellant, contended that the proper view
of the facts had not been taken by the Circuit Court, and
argued as matter of law that the decree of the District Court
ought not to have been disturbed, because the decision of a
court on a question of fact, like the verdict of a jury, should
be affirmed, unless it be clearly against the evidence. The

by the libellants, after the appeal to the Circuit Court, was

Mr. Burrell, for libellant, conceded the rule to be that the
decision of the court below, upon a question of fact, should be
deemed conclusive, and that this court should not be required
to review such decisions, and relied upon the authorities cited
by the libellant's counsel. But this principle should prevent

in the Circuit Court, and will certainly furnish no justificatioa

474-5.)
In this case the damages to the tow were occasioned by negligence and want of ordinary skill, care, and prudence on the
part of those who were intrusted with the navigation of the
tug.
Mr. Justice WAYNE. This is an appeal in admiralty from
the Circuit Court of the United States for the southern district
of New York.
It has been argued with minuteness and ability by the proctors of the parties, as well in respect to the allegations of the
libel and answer, as to the incidents of its trials in the Circuit
and District Courts. The case has had our best consideration.
The libel sets forth that Patrick Brady was the owner of the
barge Owen Gorman, and that, on the 12th April, 1856, she
left Richmond, in Pennsylvania, for Brooklyn, New York,
under the command of Patrick Campbell, with a cargo of 207
10-25 toias of coal; that, on the 17th April, the barge and
eleven other barges were towed from the Delaware and Raritan
canal, at New Brunswick, by the steamer New Philadelphia,
into the waters of the Hudson or North river. There she
landed one of the barges, at the foot of Washington street,
New York,- and another of them at the foot of IHammersly
street, and then entered the East river, with several of her
fleet, steering and heading for the Atlantic dock, in Brooklyn,
where she was to land another of the barges. That in doing
so, the steamer ran across the tide, then running a strong ebb,
and steered close to the dock, in such a manne that the Owen
Gorman was swung and driven with great violence against the
schooner (or sloop) Financier. That persons on board of the
latter, seeing the steamer swinging in, and that she would be
,struck by one of her barges, threw out a wooden fender, to
ward off the impending collision, which, having been forced
from their hands, was forced and crushed into the Owen
Gorman on her starboard side, jtst forward of midships, cut-

ring in her planks, and making a hole, through which she was
filled with water, and sunk, with her cargo.
It is alleged that the collision was caused by the negligence
and want of care or skill of the master and crew of the
steamer, and not from any fault of those persons who were
on board of the Gorman. It is also alleged that, immediately
after the sinking of the Gorman, the owners of the steanier
were informed of it, and that a protest, in due form, had been
served upon them.
The libellant then states the loss from the collision; that he
had, at the request of the agent of the owners of the steamer,
employed William J. Babcock, a wrecker, to raise her, the
latter having done, upon different occasions, work of that kind
for the company. That Babcock contracted to raise and put
her afloat for $450-it being then expressly understood, between the agent and the libellant, that, if the hole which had
caused the sinking of the barge should be found where the
latter expected and said it was, the company were to be responsible for all damages done to the barge, and for the losses
sustained from her having been sunk by the collision.
Babcock raised the barge sufficiently to have her taken to
Red Hook Point, and there beached her upon the flats, so that,
the tide rose and fell in her,-when it was ascertained that the
hole was in the starboard side of the barge, a little forward
of midships. Babcock then proceeded, without the knowledge
of the libellant, to discharge the coal from the barge, had the'
same stored in the coal yard of the consignees of it, and then
gave notice to the libellant that he had advertised the barge
and the coal for sale, to pay his wrecker's lien upon them,
which he claimed to have, in virtue of the wrecker's act of the
State of New York.
The barge and coal were sold, the first being bought by
Henry J. Vroom, for three hundred and fifty dollars; the coal
was purchased by the consignees of it, at three dollars per ton.
The sale was without the consent of the libellant, and when
he was absent from New York. When he heard of the sale
he came to New York, to protect -his interest, jnd intending
to pay Babcock for raising the barge, as the owners of the

SUPJREME COURT.
The Steamer New PhAiadelphda.

steamer had refused to do so. It was finally arranged, by his
paying to Babcock $450,.the sum which had been agreed' upon;
the further sum of $299 96 for unloading, carting, storing, and
shovelling the coal; and the further sum of $236 12 to the consignees for the deterioration of it, which had been estimated
by two referees, each party having chosen one of them.
The libellant then sets out, that the barge was so injured
from the force and violence of the collision, and the pressure
of the steamboat and inner barge, to which she was lashed
when it occurred, that it became necessary to take her to the
dry dock for repairs. That it was at a time when the barge's
services were particularly valuable to him, and that, from her
having been sunk, he had sustained damages for her repairs,
'for the loss of all her fixtures, and for thp loss of time, and for
the expenses of her master and crew, exceeding two thousand
dollars, which the consignees of the New Philadelphia had refused to pay.
The allegations in the libel are direct, positive, leaving nothing to implication, and not exaggerated, either by inapt circumstances or coloring.
We will now place in juxtaposition with it the answer. Those
pleadings will disclose the issues between the parties, and enable us to apply the evidence to them successively, or in the
order of their affirmation.
The claimants admit that they are and were the owners of
the New -Philadelphia, when the barge Owen Gorman and ten
other boats were taken by her to be towed from Brunswick,
New Jersey, to be left at New York and Brooklyn, at different
designated points in both; that they were ignorant then, as
they are still, who were the owners of the Gorman, or of the
number of tons of coal then on board of her. They deny that
she was then a tight, strong, and staunch vessel, and charge
that she was unfit for the transportation of her load for the
passage she was to make. It is then averred, upon information
and belief, that the landing of the steamer at the Atlantic
dock, in Brooklyn, where the injury to thebarge, as is described
to have happened, was in this manner:
That the steamer, after having left six barges at their places

on the North river, proceeded from it into the East river with
the other barges in tow, to leave them at their places of des-'
tination; that the Gorman was in the first tier of boats on the
outside, on the starboard side of the steamer as she approached
the Atlantic dock "from westwardly," and headed up the East
river, when the tide was about thefirst of the ebb; that one of the
barges on the steamer's larboard was destined for that dock,
and in the act of leaving her there; that the steamer came to
with her fleet with her starboard side nearest the dock, and
alongside of a sloop lying at the dock, which was a fit and suitable place to leave her, and that the steamer and her fleet were
brought to alongside of the sloop with great care and gentleness. It is admitted that a fender had been put out by some
person on board of the sloop to fend off the barge; but whether
the fender had been forced and crushed into her they were
ignorant, and deny. It is admitted that the barge sunk at
the Washington pier, to which she had been towed by the
steamer, within an hour after the collision had occurred at the
Atlantic dock.
It is then alleged that the master and crew of the barge had
allowed her to sink with her cargo, without making an effort
to prevent it, and that notice had not been given to the master of the steamer of the barge's sinking condition, to enable
him to make any attempt to do so. The claimants then deny
that Babcock had been engaged by their agent to raise the
barge, and that he had only recommended Babcock as a fit
person to be employed for that purpose; and that if their agent
had done otherwise, that it was not within the scope of those
duties they had engaged him to do; that he could make no
contract to bind them for any damage which the barge had sustained from the collision, or for any expense whatever growing
out of her having been sunk from the causes set forth in the
libel.
The damages and expenses are charged to have been largely
increased by the negligence and inattention of the master of
the barge. It is also charged, that she had been towed, under an agreement made with her master; that it was to be done
at his and her owners' risk.

SUPREME COURT.
The Steamer .Aew Philadelphda.

The issues, then, to which the evidence is to be applied, are
substantially the state of the tide when the steamer, in entering
the East river, was steered across it to land a barge at the Atlantic dock; next, that the Gorman was not seaworthy for the
carriage of her cargo, and that she was not a tight, staunch,
and strong vessel. We dismiss these averments in the answer,
by observing that the owner of the barge proved very satisfactorily that she had been well built with the best materials; had
been thoroughly repaired the year before the collision, in respect to all the wear and tear of her five or six years' service
after she was built; and that she was staunch and strong, and
particularly water-tight, when she was approaching the Atlantic
dock in tow of the steamer. Two witnesses say that they saw
her pumps tried one hour before, and that she was dry. Their
testimony is conclusive to establish tle seaworthiness of the
barge in every particular, from the time that she was lashed to
the steamer at New Brunswick to be towed to Brooklyn, until
after she had been collided with the sloop at the Atlantic dock.
The third issue is, whether or not she had been brought
alongside of that vessel with care and gentleness, or with the
force and violence of a collision, to cause the injury by which
she had been sunk.
The fourth issue arises from the charge in the answer, that
there had been a want of care in her master, in permitting her
to sink with her cargo, after she had been landed at the Washington pier, without any effort to prevent it, and from not
having informed the master of the steamer of the injury she
had sustained, or that she was sinking, until an hour or more
after she had sunk. Here, let it be remarked that we have
the respondents' own appreciation of the time of the delay of
which they complain in not having bad notice of the injury
to the Gorman, and that it was an hour or more after the occurrence. It supersedes the necessity of any further consideration of that charge, particularly as, when the steamer left
the barge at the Washington pier, she immediately steamed
off to drop another of her fleet at a distant point, without the
slightest concern or inquiry of the consequences which the
collision had produced.

Such are the issues to be considered, and the only correct
way of doing it is by a minute citation of the testimony. Kelly,
the witness, says he was on board the Gorman at the time of
the collision. The barge was on the starboard side of the
steamer next to Brooklyn, and she was the outside barge, one
other barge being between her and the steamer. The steamer
had come from the North river around Governor's island,
around Buttermilk channel, and across it to Atlantic dock.
The steamer was intending to go up East river, and was attempting to drop a barge at Atlantic dock. That barge was on larboard side of tow, but cannot specliy her position. The steamer
came in across, the tide running out a strong ebb, and, in the effort,
the tug swung round and struck the Owen Gorman against the
schooner, which was fast at the dock, with weight of the whole
tow. Two men on gchooner ran and threw a long stick or
fender between tug and steamer. The force of the junction
pressed the stick out of their hands, and raised it perpendicularly between the two vessels; blow and jar was very severe.
Witness saw the stroke; was standing forward of midships'
elect, about three feet from where the fender struck, and as he
saw it wrenched out of the men's hands, he started back to get
out of the way. The barge was forward of place where the
witness stood. The tug landed a barge, and then started up
East river with the residue of her tow, including the Owen
Gorman, to Washington street, a mile or more above, where she
was landed nicely. Then found she was lowered in the vater.
ie then went on her, and into her hold, where he found the
water up to his knees. She was hauled into dock, and there
she sunk ii twenty minutes. Found that she was making
water as soon as she was cast off from the tug. Afterwards
found planks crushed in at place where the stick or fender
struck her, about the width of two planks, and two or three
feet long; the planks were broken. Nothing occurred between
Atlantic dock and place of landing. Supposes the loading of
*coal prevented the water pressing in sooner. Tow was swung
round at Atlantic dock by the tide. After landing boats at North
river, asked master of the Gorman how she stood the service,
and a few moments before collision. He said she was per.

fectly dry, and drew the pump in witness's presence, and it
sucked perfectly dry. Had unloaded her four times before,
and never found any water in her. She was a sound and good
boat.
In the cross-interrogation of this witness, he qualifies nothing,
adds nothing, and his testimony is hot contradicted by any
other witness in the case, but is confirmed by several. Daly,
the second witness, says the tide was ebb and strong; blow was
strong; did not feel the shock; saw men putting out fenders
from the sloop; cannot describe it particularly; all done
quickly; saw the collision standing on the deck of his boat.
The tow, coming from North river, swung around and knocked
against vessel at dock. Cannot say what caused the tug to
swing round; supposed barge was injured when the blow was given.
Daniel Mcauly was in the barge, and in the cabin, when the
blow was received; felt it; dishes were knocked out of his
hand, and gave him a shock in his seat, but not severe enough
to knock him off his seat. Patrick Campbell says, tide was a
strong ebb; corroborates, in its particulars, the occasion of the collision; says it was the unskilful manner in which the steamer
attempted to land the stern-boat on her larboard side; both
she and her fleet were brought round in an unskilful and
careless manner. Either the steamboat should have headed
up the East river sooner than she did, and at a greater distance
from the dock, and, in passing up, dropped the barge she intended to land, or else she should have headed for the dock
4lntil within a certain distance, and then heaved a line, dropped
the barge, and passed on. The barge was struck on her starboard side, about midships, with great force, so as to break
the planks on that side, making two holes in the third plank
above the bilge plank. After the collision, steamer continued
on her way with the barge as far as Washington street. The
barge met with no other injury between the time of the collision and her sinking. The facts stated by the witness have
been given, with his impression of the cause and consequences
of them, when they occurred. John Campbell says the tide
was ebb and running strong. The steamboat should have
made allowance for the tide, which was running hard, which

DECEMBER TERM, 1861.

was not done. Schweimer says the tide was ebb and running
strong. William Murtagh says, I met the captain of the steamer,
and asked him how he came to sink the Owen Gorman. He
said he never landed a boat so nicely. I asked hint if he did
not swing her against a schooner. He said he was landing
one of his boats in tow at the Atlantic dock, and it being a
strong ebb tide, his tow swung round, and, the Owen Gorman
being the last boat to the "spur"

boat, swung in against a

schooner lying next to the wharf, anA that one of the hands on
board of the schooner held a wooden fender down, and it was
probable schooner and fender striking between two timbers
made a hole in her, and caused her to sink. An unsuccessful
attempt was made to weaken the force of Murtagh's testimony,
but not to discredit him, by calling as a witness Edward Duffey, who was with him at the time the conversation took place
between Murtagh. and the captain of the steamer. In Duffey's
statement of it, he does not introduce the words, "and it being a strong ebb, his tow was swung." His report of it is,
the captain said he had come to Brooklyn to land one of his
boats, and the swinging around, and the fact that the Owen
Gorman was the boat next the spur-boat, on the outside boat
of the tow, operated so that when the Owen Gorman struck a
schooner lying at the dock, that if she had got a hole in her
that caused her to sink, it must have been caused by the collision consequent on the tow swinging against the schooner.
Duffey was introduced as a witness to relieve Captain Hol 7
man from the imputation of having misstated, in his conversation with Murtagh, the time of tide when the collision took
place differently from what he said it was in his evidence.
But what the captain stated was this: "Went north of Governor's island and across Buttermilk channel, three or four
hundred yards below the end of the island, east face, then
hauled up against the ebb tide, and landed barge. He considered it a good landing. Thinks it was about slack tide in North
river; ran up the docks two or three hundred yards, and alongside of the vessel, and stopped tug, and then left the wheel,
leaving pilot there, to attend to landing a barge from the larboard side; and after landing her, continubd up to Wall street,

SUPREME COURT.
Th4e Steamer New Philadepphia

Brooklyn. Returned to the wheel again; did not see the
fender put down; it was an easy landing, with a little drift
play upon the boat. Stopped engine about two hundred feet
from the vessel at the wharf, and headway of tdg stopped
three or four feet from her, when witness left the wheel; there
was no headway at all on tow at the time of collision; headway of tow was a little in towards the vessel, and that caused
her to come into collision; it was that sheer that brought her against
the vessel. Thinks she was a sloop, about thirty feet long, and
higher than the barge; never safe to put a wooden fender between vessels; is always liable to cause damage, because these
tow-boats are weak, and fenders are apt to break them in."
We have been particular in citing Captain Holman's testimony
in his own words. Taken in all its connexion, it serves to
establish, that the cause of the collision was owing to his not
having made allowance of distance enough between the barge
and the sloop, when he was approaching her, to prevent that
sheer which brought the barge into collision with her. He
says, "headway of tow was steered a little in towards, and that
caused her to come into collision." His having said that there
was no headway at all on tow at the time of collision, does
not alter the fact of its occurrence-from his not having properly estimated his boats' inward movement towards the sloop,
when he was steering "a little towards her," and so near to
her, that the collision was caused by a sheer of the steamer.
Sheer, in nautical meaning, is a deviation from the line of the
course'in which a vessel should be steered, and though it may
occur from causes unpreventable by the most skilful seamanship, it more frequently happens from an unsteady helmsman;
and the latter was the fact in this instance, probably produced
by the person then at the helm not being watchful enough of
the state of the tide when advancing to the Atlantic dock to
land a barge. We need not cite more of the testimony to
establish it to be a fact, that, when the collision happened,
the tide was running strong ebb, and had its agency in producing the collision.
The attempt to account for the sinking of the barge by her
having been injured by iron spikes when she was left at her

place of destination, is most unsatisfactory. - Babcock's testimony in that particular, both as to his suggestions and opinions, is altogether conjectural. There is not even a possibility
of its being correct, unless the testimony of every other witness
in the case shall be considered mistaken and untrue. Babcock
did not mean to say anything untrue; but he started an idea
contrary to all the probabilities of the incident of which he was
speaking, without a single fact to support it. We have not
allowed ourselves to make any comparison or contrast between
the witnesses in this case, either as to truthfulness or intelligence, or difference of condition. We do not think that the
matters of which they spoke were above their comprehension,
because every interrogation was brother-german to the occu
pation of all of them. They were all boatmen, very much oi
the same intelligence and character, and were employed by
the parties to the suit to do their business, with an expectation
if, in the navigation of the tug and her fleet, anything should
occur leading to litigation, that they would have to resort to
them to tell how it had happened. Such considerations should
be kept in mind, in our judgments on such cases, and it should
not be presumed, either in argument or judgment, that such
classes of men have not a sense of truth fully up to their perception of moral obligation in its bearing upon those who do,
from necessity, the rougher out-door work of life.
We have not been unmindful of the charge in the answer
of the respondents, that the master of the barge had been careless in not making some effort to prevent her from sinking,,
and that the injury to her and to her cargo had been increased
by the master and owner's negligence. No testimony of either
can be found in the record. As to the damages and expenses
accruing from repairs and the deterioration of the cargo, they
were properly made the subject of a reference to a master.
His report appears to have been done judiciously, and with
the accustomed regularity of such a proceeding. The objection that he had excluded a witness, who was offered by the
counsel of the respondents, we cannot consider here, because
the proper coirse has not been taken in respect to it. There
should have been a written statement upon oath as to the par.

ticulars which the witness was offered to prove, that the court
might have compared it with what had been already proved
by the other witnesses of the respondents, to enable the court
to determine whether it was independent or only cumulative
proof.
As to the other exceptions to the sum reported by the referee,
they were fully considered by the circuit judge who tried the
appeal. They were rightly passed upon by him, and this court
particularly instructs me to say, notwithstanding that the exceptions were properly taken and argued in the Circuit Court,
that the subsequent admission of the report, in the aggregate,
by the counsel, even though that was only with the intention
to give this courtjurisdiction, shall not be reduced here by denying it in detail for the purpose of taking it away.
Our conclusions in this case are, that the ebb tide was running
strong when the steamer crossed it in going from the North into
the East river, and that in making the Atlantic dock allowances were not made for the strength of the tide, so as to reach
it with proper care and skill, and that the collision and sinking of
the Owen Gorman were the results of her having been brought,
by the steamer's fault, into collision with the sloop and the
fender which was put out to ward off an impending blow, and
the heavy pressure upon her by the steamer and the loaded
barges which she had at that moment in tow. That, putting
out the fender for such a purpose was no fault upon the part of
.he sloop, then lying fast at the dock; and, if there was any fault
in doing so from the kind of fender which had been used, the
rule of law is, that when a third pai'ty has sustained an injury to
his property from the co-operating consequences of two causes,
though the persons producing them may not be in intentional
concert to occasion such a result, the injured person is entitled to compensation for his loss from either one or both of
them, according to the circumstances of the incident, and particularly so from the one of the two who had undertaken to
convey the property with care and skill to a place of destination, and there shall have been, in doing so, a deficiency in
either.
The testimony in the case given by the libellant shows that

the Owen Gorman was tight, staunch, and strong at the time
of the collision at the Atlantic dock; that, from the time of its
happening and of the sinking of the barge did not exceed one
hour, and that she sank in twenty minutes after she had been
cast off by the steamer at her place of destination, and that
there had been no collision between the barge and anything
else while being towed to it by the steamer, nor any at that
place, to justify a conclusion that the injury sustained by the
barge had been occasioned there or anywhere else than at the
Atlantic dock, in Brooklyn, and in the manner as it has been
described by the libellant.

Deree of the Circuit Court affirmed with costs.

CLARK VS. HACKETT.

1. This court will award a certiorari when diminution of the record is
suggested, even at the third term, if the delay be accounted for;
but the hearing of the cause will not be postponed on that account.
2. Where a party contested with his own assignee in bankruptcy the
right to a fund, and the controversy was decided in favor of the assignee by the Circuit Court, whose decree was affirmed by this
court, the same question cannot be litigated again.
8. Where the bankrupt before the distribution of the fund among the
creditors filed a bill impeaching the decree of the Circuit Court
and of the Supreme Court for fraud of the parties, (including his
own counsel,) and entirely failed to establish his allegations, the
bill must necessarily be dismissed.
This was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the district of New Hampshire, brought up, filed
and docketed in this court to December term, 1859. On the
3d of January, 1862, the cause being No. 67 on the docket
of the present term,
Mr. Black,. of Pennsylvania, for appellant, suggested diim.
nution of the record, and moved for a certiorari on affidavits,
which accounted for the delay.
