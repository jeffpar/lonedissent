ExecuToRs -vs. JoHN T. Sw~w.
Where an appeal has been dismissed, the appellant having omitted to gIe a transcript of the record within the time required by the rule of court, an official
certificate of the dismissal of the appeal may not be given by the clerk during
the term. The appellant may file the transcript with the clerk during the term,
and move to have the appeal reinstated.. To allow such a certificate would
be to prejudge such a motion.

clerk of this court, before the adjournment of the present
ferm of this-court, an official ceriificate of the dismissal of
this aipeal, dismissed last Saturday, being the 30th of January, of the present term of this court:
It is ordered that the said motion be overruled; and that
the leave prayed for be refused; as undei-the practice of this
court, the appellants would have a right during the present
term to lodge a transcript of the record of said appeal with
the clerk of this court, and move to have the appeal reinstated; whereas to grant the present prayer or motion would
be tW prejudge such a motion. Per Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL.
