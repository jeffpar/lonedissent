#fVHE deciee of the, Circuit Court, for the Ditlri6I of
jL Rhode Ijland, was affirmed in this caufe, without argument, the principal quefilon, Ahich it involved, having been
juff decided upon the difculion of another writ of error. It
appeared, however, by an eftimate of the damages on which
the decree was founded, and which was annexed to the record,
that a charge of i6oo dollars for counfel's fees in the courts
below, had beeen allowed ; to which Coxe objeCted; and Ingerfoll contended that it might fairly be included under the
d
idea of damages. But
By ,THEtOURT:-W e do not think that this charge ought
to be allowed. The general praffice of the United States is
in opofition to it; and even if that pradice were not ftri~lly
correa in principle, it is entitled to the refped of the court,
till it is changed, or -modified, by itatute. ,
There are feveral ways in wlflch the charge may be expunged: but we recommend as, perhaps, the eafieft way, that
the counfel for the Defendant in error, fhould enter a eemnitti,
tur for the amount.
A remittitur was accordingly entered.
MOODIE
178e ; havifig made a will by withli he devifed certain lands in that
1ate to the Defendant in eiror, who then was, and ever has been, a
Britifl fubje&, refident in Oreat Britain. The queftion is5 whether being thus an alien, the Defendant in error call take and hold the lapds by dcvile ? And, it will be contended, that his title is completely prote&ed
by the Treaty of Peace, concluded between the United States and Great
Britain, in the year 1783.
CHASE,
iulice
: I reeolleL, that in H-arrifon's cafe, a decifion in favor
offuch a devifee's title was given, by a court in Maryland. It is a
matter, howeVer, of gret mollmisent ; and ottght tO be deliberately aad
finally fettled.
