" bill (or bills) with coffs of fuit." It is agreed, that, under r79.
this law, damages might have been recovered upoi the proteft
for non-acceptance merely; but then the bills and proteft for
non-acceptance, muff have been returned in a reafonable time;
whereas they were not returned till a year had elapfed; the
bills were protefted for non-payment; and in point of fa&,
it is conceded, that the adion is brought upon the proteff for
non-payment, and not upon the proteft for non-acceptance.
The notice of the non-acceptance will not alter the cafe; for
the bills with the proteft fhould have been returned to the
drawers, fo as to put it in their power to take them up, and to
purfue their remedy over againft the drawee, in cafe he had
their affets in his hands at the time of proteft. Then confidering the cafe upon the proteff for non-payment, no damages
ought to be allowed, unlefs the bills were duly protefled; and it
appears, from the Plaintiff's own ihewing, that they were not
proteffed for ten days after they had become payable, which is
not fo foon as it might have been from the nature of the cafe,
or as it ought to have been according to the law of merchasts,
by which only three days- grace are allowed. It is true, that
this proteff may be in time for one purpofe at common law,
for infance, to maintain an aaion againff the drawer, who had
no affets in the hands ofthe drawee, at the time of proteff;
and yet the bills fhall not be deemed duly protefled for another
purpofe, by ftatute, for inftance, to entitle the payee to recover
damages.
It will be urged, however, that the allowance of damages,
only appears by the nota bene fulboined to the judgment of the
court below, and that this ouaht not to be taken into confideration as a part of the record. But what conftitutes a record, is
a very different thing, in different ftates. The mode of ftating
the judgment, or the reafons for it, will, likewife, admit of great
latitude and diverfity. If the purport of the nota bene had been
incorporated with the judgment, there would have been no,
ground for cavil ; and where is the fubftantial difference, whether the judge delivers the explanation himfelf, or dire~ls it
(which, for aught that appears, may be the fa&) to be entered
by the clerk ? If the court had confined its view to the mere
formal part of the record in the cafe of Bingham' Plaintiff in
error verfu4 Cabot, (ant, p. i9. ) the ground of reverfing the
judgment below could never have appeared; and if the nota
bene is reverfed here, it cannot be determined what has been
tried by the court below, But, after all, the allowance of damages muff neceffarily be inferred from the record, independent
of the nota bene. Thus, the declaration fets forth and demands
the principal intereft, coft and damages, accruing by virtue of
cetiiji bills of exchange i and thq demand being reducible to

and by mere calculation, from data exifting on the record,
corre6t any error that has been committed. Since, then, there
is a judgment for more than the principal, intereft, and cofts
upon the billsof exchange, the furplus muft be error ; and the
nota bene only ferves to explain how that furplus .has arifen.,
3 d. Erroraffigned. The damages ought not to have been
afleffed by the court. It is admitted, that where a demand appears to a certainty upon the record, or may be reduced to a
certainty by the ufe of figures, the court may itfelf make the
calculation, or refer it to the proper officer to be done. 3 Leon.
23.1 Hen. Black 54 I . if, therefore, the declaration had demanded nothing more than appears on the face of the bills,
the prefent exception could not prevail ; becaufe the fpecific
fum to be adjudged might be conclufively afcertained by adding, upon a fimrple procefs of figures, the amount of the intereff to the principal ; though even that dcLrine has been controverted in a very recent cafe, 4.. 7" Rep, 275. But. the
demand is not only for the principal and intereft, but, likewife,
-for damages, which are altogether uncetain; depending upon the fadf, that the bills have been returned duly protefted;
and that faa involving a complicated inveftigation into the period of the return, as well as into the time and mode of proteft.
Even, indeed, with refped to the intereft, a fimilar uncertainty arifes under the provifion of the Rhode Ifland law; fince
intereft is to be allowed from the time of purchafing the bills;
and, therefore, the time of purchafing the bills was a faat to be
afcertained, before any calculation could be made. But exclufive of thefe points, neceflarily conneifted with the bills, the
Defendant under the general iffue, which he had tendered,
was entitled to bring a great variety of matters into his defence. As there is much diverfity in the laws on this fubjel, forne allowing 2o per cent. others only IQ per cent
damages, and fome no fpecific damages at all, the place of
drawing the bills may be material. Nor can it be faid, that
the judgment by default, even if it had been regularly entered,
would admit all that is demanded in the declaration ; it admits
the caufe of ation as ftated, but does not admit the quantum
of the demand. The Defendant might, therefore, have fhewn
aa endorfenment after the bills werediflhonored, and a fubfequent
paymen, on the principle laid down in TermnReport, 82. for, an
endorfement in fuch cafe is not conclufive againft the drawer.

ted from matters of law, it will be agreed to be a general and
favorite pradice, to allot the affefsment of damages to a jury.
The ancient authorities are, it is true, exceedingly crude in
relation to the diftribution of jurifdiaion" between judges and
juries; but we have received the dodrine in its modern, perfe&, itate; and as fuch, are deeply interefted in adhering to it.
So forcible is the modern example of the Englifk courts, that
the judges have refifed even to value foreign money; 4 T.
Rep. 493 ; and a motion for referring a bill of exchange, drawn
for Iri/h fterling, to the mafter, in order to fee what was due,

remarked, that the bills of exchange, in the prefent inflance,
were drawn for Britif fterling money; which is, furely, as
much to be denominated foreign money in an American court,
as Irih flerling can be fo denominated in an Engiilb court.*
Befides, it is to be confidered, that in England damages are
compenfatory; while in Rhode Ifland, in moft of the other
1la.tes in the Union, and in many foreign countries, damages
are in the nature of a penal fum, given by ftatute ; and not a
folitary authority can be produced, where any court has referred a bill of exchange to the Prothonotary, to add by way of
damages, any fum beyond the precife computation of intereft.
The dodtine having, then, been thus fettled in England, the
queflion grifes, whether the ftatutes of Rhode Iand have made
any difference in the common law ? By the adt, regulating
the proceedings in the courts of that State (page 59.) it. is provided, " That in all cafes, both at the inferior and fuperior"
" courts, where judgment thall pafs by default, difcontinuance,
".nihil dicit, non fum informatus, or demurrer, where damages
are to be enquired into and affeffed, damages flall be enquir"ed into and affeffed by the court, or otherwife, by a writ of

ground of our -contrudfion, whether the aflieftinent of the
damages ought not to have been referred to a jury. iff.
On the firfi of thefe grounds of confideration, there is no key
to an explanation, but the ad of Congrefs ; which declares
" that

"cafes where they apply." Now, though this is an adoption
of the laws of Rhode Iftand, where they apply, it cannot be
confidered as a recognition of all the modes of praaice, which
may have been introduced to determine the rights of a party,
compelling the Federal Courts, whatever may be the extravagance of thofe modes, to be in all refpe&s as erratic as the
courts of the States. For inifance; though where the State
law regulates the defcent of real property, the Circuit Court
muft decide conformably to the lex loci ; yet if the State Legiflature had inftituted the ordeal, or trial by battle, to afcertain
who was thQ right heir, the Judges of the Circuit Court would
not, furely, ere& themfelves into fuch a tribunal, and prefide at
fuch a mockery. If the Federal Courts fhould attempt to alter
the fundamental laws of defcent, the citizens of Mafachufetts,
or Rhode I land, would have reafon to complain, and the complaint would certainly be heard ; but if., difdaining to fan6Sify
the errors of clerks, and the blunders of yearlings (to whom too
often the bufinefs of keeping and'making up a record is confided) the Federal Courts fÂ£hould difcountenance and rejeft the
errors and irregtqlarities of the pradice of the State Courts,
every fuitor would gratefully acknowledge the obligation.
There is, perhaps, occafion to lament, that errors in juriprudence have too long kept the citizens of the Eaflern States in
darknefs, ignorant of their. rights and duties ; and it is one of

the beneficial confequences, that may be fairly expe~ed from
the eflablifhment of the national government, that fuch amendmerits will every where be introduced into the praaice of the
law, as are confillent with fubflantial juftice, legiflative ats,

this ground, fince a true confiruaion of the Rhode Ian4 law

turn of debt, and in which it demands the interference of a jury r79 7.
for the affeffment of damages. The oppofite conifruttion leads
to the abfurdeft confequences. The Judge might, at pieafure
fubmit a promiffory note to a jury for the mere calculation of
intereft ; and undertake himfelf to affefs the damages in an action for a libel, when judgment has been Liven on demurrer
for the Plaintiff. In the latter inflance, he would be obliged to
try the truth of the allegation and the credibility of the witneffes, and to decide the extent of the injury which the libel has
produced; and if a judgment thus prepofteroufly rendered,
thould be brought hither, this court would be bound to affirm
it : But there is furely no cafe, confiftently with the fcope of
the judicial ad, where the Circuit Court can decide a point of
law, without affording an opportunity upon the record, for its
'being examined, affirmed, or reverfed on a writ of error. In
equity caufes, it is provided, that the fads on which the decree
of the Circuit Court is founded, fliall be made to appear upon
the record ; and in common law caufes the principle equally
applies, that a Judge ought not to be allowed to travel over
ground, where he can never be traced. Then, if the difcretion
mentioned in the Rhode I#and ad is a legal difcretion to afcertain the diffributive jurildidion between Judges and Juries,
and not an authority for the former to blend and ufurp the
powers of the latter ; and if the Judges in this cafe have decided what the Jury 6ught to have affeflkd ; it is an error in point
of law, which this court is competent to corred. Whatever
may be the pradice of the lawyers of Rhode Ifland, it is but a
conftru&ion of the law, and not the law itfelf; and if it is an
erroneous conifrudion, this court, fo far from being bound to
adopt, is bound to reje&, it. Nor is the error cured by any
ifatute of Jeoffaile. The cafe from 7 Vin. Adbr. p. 308. P1. 24only fhews that the want of a formal writ of error was cured,
where the damages appeared to have been, in fa&, affeffed by
ajury: but there is no reafon in the cafe itfelf, or in thecafes
there cited, that if damages had not been affeffed at all, or had
been affeffed by an improper tribunal, the error would not be
fatal.

For the Defendant in error. ift. Error affigned.-It will
be proper to prernife, on general principles, that great difficulties muft have arifen in organifing the Federal Courts, fo as to
prevent an injurious clafhing with the jurifdidqion and pradice
of the various State Courts. From thefe difficulties there
could be found no other mode of efcaping, than by adopting,
for the government of the Federal Courts, the fame law and
pradice that prevailed in the refpedive States, in which thofe
courts, from time to time, exercifed their fun&ions. The policy of the meafure was likewife fupported by its tendency to
make

make the new government fit eafy on the public mind, and to
facilitate the adminiftration of juftice throughout the Union'.
For, as the law and forms of the refpedive'State Courts had
been adopted in order to accomplifh fubifantial juilice, according to the peculiar and local circumfiances of each State ; and
as the people were content under the operation of thofe municipal rogulations ; it was natural to prefume, that by adopting
the fame rule for the Federal 'Courts, the fame falutary effeft
would be produced. But, on the other hand, it is obvious that
any projea for a gleneral-fyftem of jurifpiudence, co-extenfive
with the Union, could only, have engendered difcontents, and
mull have been abortive. To have attempted a theory of law and
praf-ice entirely novel, would have occafioned endlefs perplexity;
and to have fuperfeded the fettled pra6lice of fome States, in order to introduce the practice of others; to compel, for inflance,
the lawyers of Maffachufetts, to ftudy and enforce the pra6lice
of the lawyers of South Garolina, would have occafioned endlefs jealoufy and inconvenience. From thefe confiderations
the Congrefs wifely enaced, " That the laws of the feveral
States, except where the conftitution, treaties, or ftatutes, of
" the United States fhall otherwife require or provide, fhall be
regarded as rules.of decifion in trials at common law in the
courts of the United States, in cafes where they apply." This
adoption of the State laws, extends as well to the unwritten, as
to the written law ;-ro the law arifing from eftablifhed ufage
and judicial determinations, as well as to the law created by
pofitive a~s of the Legiflature. And the a6f for regulating
procefs, in language equally general adopts" in each State refpec" tively, fuch forms and modes as are ufed or allowed in the
Supreme Courtsof the famel'." 'The only queftion, therefore, to afcertain the legal correctnefs of the prefent record, iswhat are the laws and modes adopted by the State of Rhode
I/land, in relation to the controverted points ? It is immaterial, how far the anfwer hall be inconfiftent with certain dogma
of the Englifh comnmon law, or at.variance with the municipal regulations ot any other State ; it is enough to fhew that
fuch are the laws and modes of Rhode fland, and that they are
competent to all the purpofes of juftice.
With refped, then, to the affignment of error, becaufe
there was a difcontinuance of the fuit, a reference to the uniform pra~Lice of Rhode Ijiand, muff furnifh a decifive refutation. Both in the Court of Common pleas, and the Superior

afteffling the damages themfelves, the affeffment ftands in the
place of a writ of enquiry; and furely the principles on which
a Jury give their verdict, can never be the foundation for a
writ of error. 'Bills of Exchange add Protefts are coeval with

that if the Drawee had failed with effects in his hands, between

bills wcre idly protefred, in time and: manner, according to the
law -of merchant ; and as the Rkodc4fland act does not de,
fignate any pa rtituIar .prbeefs.of'proteft, that law'mull' have
been, contenplated as furriiffhifig a rule to decide the queftion.
It is' manifefti theb, frbm. all' the authorities as well as from the
-order-to be duly protefted according
re'afon of the cafe;that iri
to" fhe law 6fnerchauts, it is. not neceffary to 1e.done..within
,the three days of grace, or any othzr fpecific term; .The ufan.
ces on Bills of Exchange differ, in different countriies ; and the
cafe in Showers'. Reports p* . proves that a bill 'may be duly
protefted'even 30 days After it has become due, if the drawer
.does not ffiew, that he.has fuftainrd. fbme daniage by thedelay.
3 4 Error af tgned, It may be thought by fome to be a
fubjed for rearer, that Rhode /7and has not difcovered. the fuperior meritsof the fyftems refting on the EigliJh common law,
or invented b.y the jiirifprudential fkill of her fifter flates; but,
,s it has fo happenedl it will not be difputed, that within her'jurifdi-ion Whatever is her law, and not what is.the. law qfpther'
â¢c6untries or ftates, muft furnifl the rule for decifion. O6 the
cafes in which there exifis a necefiity of employing writs ofenquiry, the diverfity of theory and pralice has been great, at different periods of juridical hiftory, and at different places, in.fluenced by the principles of the Bi-itijh laws. In fome of
the States, writs.'of enquiry are executed on every occafion,
'even to fix a mer comptitation of intereft, but in New Enkland, and cfpecially in Maffachbufetts and Rhode Ifland, a
writ of enquiry never iffues, but at the requeft of the parties, or by the diizretion of the court, in whofe prfence it is
-invariably executed. No language can be more forcible to
'exclude the oppofite conftruotion, than the language of the
Rhode Iflnd ael which declares, "1 that in all cafes where
Judgment fhall pafs by default, &c. where damages are to be
enqured, into and afcffeid, it fhall be done by the court, or
otherwife, at their difcietion." The pradice founded on this
law, and co-eval with it in commencement, furnifhes the beft
expofition. Thus, the judges affign a day, after every term,
to affefs damages in defaulted cafes; and, however prepofterous it may be deemed by thofe who pradice upon another
