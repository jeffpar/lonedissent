FOWLER et al. vs. MILLER.

A RULE had been originally ob.tained in thefe a&ionS(which were depending in the Ciicuit Court for the
)iftri&6t of Conneicut) at the inftance of the Defendants, requiring the Plaintiff to fhew caufe, why a Venire fhould hot
be awarded to fummon a Jury from fome D.iftri&, other thaa

that of'Gdnnejicut or New--York ; but it was changcd,, by con-,

fent, into a rule to fhew caufe why the aa.ions (hould not be
removed by Gertiorariinto the Supreme Qotrt, as exclu-fivelj.
belonging to that jurifdi&ion. On ffhewing caxfe, it appeared,.
that fuits, in the nature of E"e&ments, had been inf.ituted in
the Circuit Court for the Di iri&c of Connea.icut, to recovcr .
"tra& of land, being part of the Connealicut Gore which that.
flate had granted to ndrew JJ/ardand Jeremiah aflae,, and
by Whom it had been conveyed to the Plaintiffs. The Defendants pleaded that they were inhabibtants of the State of
New-York ; that the premifes, for which the fuits were brought ,
lay in the County of Steuben, in the flate of New-York ; anid
that the Circuit Court for the D.ffri6t of New-York, or the
Courts of the State, and no other Court, could take cognizance
of the a&ions. The Plaintiffs replied, that the premifes lay in
the State of Connel7icut ; and, iffue being joined, a venire was.
awarded. On the return, however, the Defendants challenged
the array, becaufe the Marfhall of the Difria of, Conneoiscut,.
a refident and citizen ot that State, had arrayed the Jury by
his deputy, who was, al:o, a citizen of Conne'icut,and intereft-,
ed as a purchafer, or claimant, in the Connetficut Gore, under the fame title as the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs prayed oyer of
the record and return, averred that the deputy Marfhal. was.-.
not interefled in the queftion in iffue, and demurred to the.
challenge for being double, and contrary to the record, which does, â€¢
not fhew that the Jury was returned by the deputy Marfhall. Th.Defendants joined in demurrer.

The Gdurt. over-ruled, the.

challenge, as it refpeaed the general intereft of the Marfhall
and his deputy, owing to their being citivens of Connefticut
