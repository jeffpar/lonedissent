HIS caude being marked for trial, Ingerfoll,moved for i,
continuance, on the ground, that a Bil in equityhad beeRi
filed by his client, the Defendant, in .the Circuit Court, for thd

to the matters in controverfy in the prefent fuit; but that the
Plaintiff here had refufed to file an anfwer to the billi in confequence of whichi an attachment had iffued againt him. Af.

Very reluctant to agree to the continuance of a caufe of this

defcription' which, in a variety of fhapes, has been long dependingi I think the particular circumftance that have been
flated, call for the interpofition of the Court. The difclofure
of certain fais, that depend on the knowledge of the Plaintiff,
it'deemed effential to a fair decifion: if the difclofure will not
injure him, he can have no reafon for refutfing to make it.; while
his refufal to anfwer the bill in equity filed in New York, at the
fame time that he prefl'es for a trial-of the common law fuit here,
raifes a ftrong prefumption againfa him: Under this imprefflon
therefore, the continuance is now allowed; and we fhall be
difpofed to hear favorably every future application.to pof{pone
a trial, until the Plaintifl has filed a fatisfa6lory anfwer to the
bill in equity,
