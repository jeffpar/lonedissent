PERSE-

IS was a writ of error to remove the proceedings in

an admiralty caufe from the Circuit Court for the dif-

tri~t of Rhode Ifland. Soon after the. decree was there pronounced the Diftria Judge died, and Judge CHASE had left
the diftri6t ; fo that the record was fent up with all the evidence annexed, but no ftatement of facts by the court.
Du Ponceau and Robbins, fo the Defendant in error, infifted, that the Plaintiff could not go into a confideration of
errors in fa&; and, that the rules efabliffied in the cafes of
(lVifjtartv. D'Auchy (ant. p. 321.) Pintadov. Bernard,and the
UnitedStatesv. La Vengeance, (ant. p.) were conclufive. They,
alto, cited the following authorities: i Fern. 166. 214. zr6. 3
Wd/is. 308. 2 Bl. Rep. 831. I Mod. 207. 56. 61. Gro. E. 667.

E. Tilgbman, for the Plaintiff in error, admitted, that, although the cafe of a record tranfmitted with the evidence, but
without a ftatement of fa&s, had never been exprefsly decided, vet, that it appeared to be embraced by the reafoning of
the Chief Jufice, in fupport of the fecond rule in J'fifcart v.
D'Aucby; and if the court were, alfo, of that opinion, he
would decline troubling them with any further argument.*
* CHASe, Juftice. Even if the court were to permit it, you would
find little encouragement to enter into the merits: The evidence is too

plainly againft you.

PATERSON, 7 ufice:-Though I was filent on the occa1797.
(ion, I concurred in opinion with Judge
il/fon Upon the fe- i." -.
cond rule laid down in f'Jifcart v. D'Zuchy; and, of courfe,
the court were divided, four to two, upon the decifion. I
thought, Indeedi that excluding a corifideiation of the evidence (which, virtually, amohunts to a Patement of fa)s) was
flutting the door againit light and truth ; and was leaving the
property of the country too much to the difcretion and judg4
ment of a fingle Judge, But conceivihtt myfelf bound by the
rule, and that, in fome f{ape, the fa&s muft be made to appear on the record, I have always fince thought it my duty to
make a ftatement, where the counfel Would not, be could not,
agree in forming one.
As to the prefent point, though there is no exprefs determination, it was the fubje& of difcuffion among the Judges at
their chamber ; an opinion was formed, but ilot delivered, by
the (ame majority, that effablifhed the fecond rule in
i/icart
verfus DAuchy ; and the reaforiing of the Chief Juftice irt
fupport of that rule, went clearly to this cafe. I do not, therefore, think, that any new argument can be neceffary, However difpofed I might have been originally to give the moft liberal conifru-tion to the ad of Congrefs, the decifion of the
Court precludes me from confidering the evidence, at this time,
as a flatement of fads ; and if there is no ftatement of fadts,
the confequence feems naturally to follow, that there can be
no error.
THE COUIRT concurring in the reprefentation made by
Judge PATERSON, they proceeded) without further argument
on the principal queftion, to
Affirm the Decree.
E. Tilghman fiiggefted, however, that the damages were
very high, and that, in fad, an allowance for counfel fees
was included, though it did not appear on the record.
Du Ponceau, urged, thatthe court could not travel out df
the record to afeertain a fad. In the cafe where an allowance for counfel's fees had been ifruck out, that charge and
all the items on which damages had been awarded, were flated
in an account annexed to the tecord.*
CHASE, Yuftice:--An account of items, as a foundation to
award damages, was exhibited in the. court below: but 'itis a
fufficient anfwer here, that the allowance does not appear on
the record.
THE COURT concurred in this opinion; and Du Ponceaupray I
ed an encreafe of damages for the delay occafioned by bringing
this writ of error, contending, that under the 2 3 d fection of the
