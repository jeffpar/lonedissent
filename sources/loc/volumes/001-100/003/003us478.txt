the general rule is, that the bail may furrender within the
Irf' four days of the term, to which thefeirefacias is returnable.
hVerid, Pr. 377, 381. 4 Burr. 2i34. And if the bail is
prevented from making a furrender by any legal bar, even hrifing from matter ex poqlfado, he fhall be entitled to an eioneretur. i Purr. 339, 340. Sell. i8o. Str. 1217. i Burr;
339, 340. Doug. 45- Sell. 183. Whether, therefore, the bail
could, or could not,, furrender the Defendant after the time that
privilege had occured, the prefent application is equally welt
founded. But to place the cafe on the faireff footing, the bail
will confent on the principles recognized in i Str, 419.
to remain refponfi-ble for -furrendering the Defendant, within
four days after the feflfins of Congrefs, provided that time is
alowed to make the furrender.
E. Tilgbman and RdJ1, the Plaintiffs counfel, having con4
fidered the propofition, for allowing further time to make the
furrender, agreed to it;. and THE COURT declared their approbation of the compromifei as affording a,good precedent for future cafes 9 f a fimilar kind,
Tilghnan then acknowledged, that he thought the privilege
of Congrefs extended to arrefts on judicial, as well as mefnej
procefs; but controverted the doitrine that a perfon arreffed
before he had: privilege, was entitled to be difcharged, in confqquence of privilege afterwards acquired.
