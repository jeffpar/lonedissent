V. CRAIG.

In ejeetment, an amendment, so as to enlarge the term laid in the
declaration, will be permitted, in the discretion of the Court.
'Buta writ of error will not lie, in a ease where the Court below has
denied a motion for this purpose.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of Kentucky.
In 1797, John Den, lessee of Ambrose Walden,
instituted an action of ejectment in the United
States District Court of the District of Kentucky,
against Richard Fen, as casual ejector. The declaration states a demise for the term of ten years
from the 15th day of August, 1789. At March
term, 1798, Lewis Craig and Jonathan Rose were
admitted defendants, in 'the place of Richard
Fen, the casual ejector;. and entered into the
usual rule, confessing the lease, entry, &c. At
June term, 1800, judgment was rendered for the
plaintiff for his term yet to come, &c. and a writ
of hab.fac poss. was awarded. Onthe 5th day
of September, 1800, Thomas Bodley and others,
claiming as landlords of Craig and Rose, obtained
an injunction to, the above judgment. At May
term, 1809, the bill of injunction was dismissed,
for want of jurisdiction. In September, 1811,
Bodley and others obtained a second injunction
to stay execution on the judgment at law in ejectment. At May term; 1812, the injunction
was

dissolved on hearing, on. bill, answers, depositions, and exhibits; and in April, 1813, the corplainants dismissed their bill. Walden, on the 22d
poss.,
of May, 1819, took out a writ of hab.fac.
.which was quashed by the Court, on the ground,
it is presumed, that the term stated in the declaration in ejectment had expired. At November
term, 1821, Walden moved-the Court to enlarge
the term stated in the declaration. The Court
being divided, the motion was entered as overruled; and the plaintiff (WValden) took out a writ
of error to the judgment of the Court oil this
motion.
This cause was argued by Mr. Taylor,a for the

plaintiff, no counsel appearing for the defendant.
Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.
Upon this case two questions arise:
1. Ought the Circuit Court to have granted
leave to the plaintiff to extend the term laid in his
declaration ?
2. Does a writ of error lie to the refusal to grint
this amendment?
It has been truly said in argument, by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, that the power of
amendment is extended at least as far in the 32d

CASES IN THE SUPREME COURT

section of the judiciary act, as in any of the British statutes; and that there is no species of action to which the discretion of the Court in this
respect ought to be more liberally applied than to
the action of ejectment. The proceedings are, all
fictitious, fabricated for the mere purposds of justice, and there is every reason for allowing amendments in matters of mere form. There is peculiar reason in this case, where the cause has been
protracted, and the plaintiff kept out of possession
beyond the term laid in the declaration, by the excessive delays practised by, the opposite party.
The cases cited by the plaintiff's counsel in argument are, we think, full authority for the amendment which was asked in the Circuit Court, and
we think the motion ought to have prevailed. But
the course of this Court has not been in favour of
the idea that a writ of error will lie to the opinion
of a Circuit Court, granting or refusing a motion
like this. No judgment in the cause is brought
up by the writ, but merely a decision on a collateral motion, which may be renewed. For this reason, the writ'of error must be dismissed.
