SUPREME COURT.

ALBERT P. DE VALENGIN'S ADMINISTRATORS, PLAINTIFFS
ERROR, VS. JOHN H. DUFFY, DEFENDANT IN ERROR.

IN

It has been frequently held, that the device of covering property as neutral, when in truth it
was belligerent; is not contrary to the laws of war or of nations. Contracts made with underwriters in relation to property thus covered, have always been enforced in the Courts
of a neutral country, where the true character of the property, and the means taken to
protect it from capture have been fairly represented to the insurers. The same doctrine
has always been held where false papers have been used to cover the property, provided
the underwriter knew, or was bound ta know, that such stratagems werd always resorted
to by the persons engaged in that trade. If such means may be used to prevent capture,
there can be no good reason for condemning with more severity, the continuation of the
same disguise after capture, in order to prevent the condemnation of the property, or to
procure compensation for it, when it has been lost by reason of the capture. Courts of
the capturing nation would never enforce contracts of that description ; but they have
always been regarded as lawful in the Courts of a neutral country.
Whatever property or money is lawfully recovered by the executor or, admimncrator, after
the death of his testator or intestate, in virtue of his representative character, he holds as
assets of the estate; and he is liable therefor in such representative character, to the
party who has a good title thereto. The want of knowledge, or the possession of knowledge on the part of the administrator, as to the rights and claims of other persons upon
the money thus received, cannot alter the rights of the party to whom it ultimately
belongs.
The owner of-property or of money received by an administrator, may resort to the administrator in his personal character, and charge him, de bonis propriis, with the amount
thus received. He may do this, or proceed against him as executor or administrator,
at his election. But whenever an executor or administrator, in his representative character, lawfully receives money or property, he may bb compelled to respond to the party
entitled, in that character; and shall not be permitted to throw it off after he has received
the money, in order to defeat the plaintiff's action.
In the cam of a factor who sells the goods of his principal in his own name, upon a credit,
and dies before the money is received, if it is afterwards paid to the administrator in
his representative character, the creditor would be entitled to consider it as assets in his
hands; and to charge him in the same character in which he received it. The debtor
that is to say, the party who purchased from the factor without any knowledge of the
true owner, and who paid the money to the administrator under the belief that the goods
belonged to the factor, is unquestionably discharged by this payment; yet he cannot be
discharged unless he pays it to one lawfully authorized to receive it, except only in his
representative character.

IN error to the Circuit Court of the United States for th'..District
of Maryland.
In the Circuit Court of Maryland, John I-I. Duffy, the defendant
in error, instituted a suit against the administrators of Albert P. De
Valengin, for the recovery of a sum of money which he claimed to
belong to him, being a portion of the indemnity paid by the governmeat of Brazil, for the capture and loss of the btig President Adams,
by a Brazilian cruiser, in 1828.
Johh.H. Duffy, a citizen of 1he United States, domiciled at.Buenos
Ayres, in 1828, shipped a quantity of hides, and other articles of
merchandiso, in 1828, on board the brig President Adams, commanded and part owned by Albert P. De Valengin, a citizen of Bal-

[De Valengin s Admainistrators vs. Dufly.]

timore, for Gibraltar. The government of Brazil, and that of
Buenos Ayres were then at war.
For the better security of the propertyfrom Brazilian capture,
the property was shipped in the name of De Valengin, and, soon
after she sailed she was captured by an armed vessel of Brazil, and
carried into Monte Video. There, both vessel and cargo were
totally lost.
Under an agreement between John H. Duffy and Captain De Valengin, a claim for the cargo as well as the vessel was made by him
on the government of Brazil, for indemnity. The ownrship of
John H. Duffy was concealed in this application; as his property
was liable to capture by the cruisers of Brazil; he being domiciled
at Buenos Ayres. Captain De Valengin died before any thing was
recovered from the government of Brazil for the President Adams
and cargo; and a certain James Neale, who had become his administrator, under letters of administration granted in Maryland, prosecuted the claim as the representative of De Valengin; and was, at
length, paid the indemnity in Baltimore, by the aid of Mr. James
Birkhead, of Rio do Janeiro; who remitted it to him from that place.
The proceeds of the property remitted by Mr. Birkhead, were returned 'in an' inventory filed by Mr. Neale, as ad.iinistrator, in, the
Orphans Court, at Baltimore, as the estate of De Valengin.
A suit for the recovery of the amount claimed by John H. Duffy,
was instituted in the Circuit Court of the United States against
James Neale, as the administrator of De Valengin; and he having
died before the trial of the cause, and the plaintiffs in error having
taken out letters of administration, de bonis non, to the estate of De
Valengin, they were summoned, and they appeared and took deferice in the action.
In the declaration in the action, the only count applicable to the
controversy between the parties to the suit, was that for money had
and received by James Neale, the administrator of De Valengin, for
the use of the plaintiff. On the issues of non assumpsit and plene
administravit, the jury found for the plaintiff on the first, and for the
defendants on the second count. The Circuit Court entered a judgment on the first plea for the amount found by the jury, fourteen
thousand and thirteen dollars and sixty-seven cents: the judgment
to bind assets.
From this judgment the defendants prosecuted this writ of error.
On the trial of the cause in the Circuit Court, the defendants took
a bill of exceptions to the decisions of the Court, on six different propositions or prayers, submitted by their counsel for the opinion of the
Court. The bill of exceptions colhtains the whole evidence in the
cause. All the prayers of the counsel for the defendants were refused by the Court.
The opinion of the Supreme Court on the matters presented unaer
the writ of error, was given on two propositions; into which all
those submitted in the Circuit Court were considered to be resolved.
"1. That the agreement between Captain De Valengin and John

284

SUPREME COURT.
[De Valengin's Administrators vs. Duffy.)

H. Duffy, under which De Valengin was to claim remuneration from
the Brazilian government, for the loss of the brig President Adams
and her dargo, on the ground of its being neutral property ; when,
in truth, the cargo was the property pf John H. Duffy, and therefore
belligerent, and liable to capture by the laws of nations; was fraudulent and immoral: and that the Courts of Justice of the United States
will not assist a party to recover money due on such agreement."
"2. That if the money belonged to John H. Duffy, the action
would not lie against Neale, as administrator, nor the money be
assets in his hands of De Valengin's pstate; that his return to the
Orphans Court cannot alter the character of the transaction : and
that this suit ought to have been continued against Neale's administrator, and not against the representatives of De Valengin."

The case was submitted to the Court on printed arguments, by
Mr. M'Mahon and Mr. Johnson, for the plaintiffs in error; and by
Mr. Williams, for the defendant in error.
On the first proposition, as stated by the Circuit Court in its opinion:
the counsel for the plaintiffs in error contended, that the all ged agreement between John H. Duffy, the defendant in error, and Captain
De Valengin, by which the latter was to prosecute the claim on the
Brazilian government, for indemnity for the loss of the brig President Adams and her cargo, representing the whole property to belong to him, and, as such, not liable to capture; proposes nothing
more or less than the case of two persons conspiring to cheat a third
party out of his property.
The object of the agreement was merely to extract money from
the third party; and this was to be accomplished by conspiring to
make a false and fraudulent representation of an injury done to one
of ihem, who, in fact, had sustained no injury; and this falsely
alleged injury is made the sole basis of the payment by the third
party. The verdict of the jury admits that the payment was made
only in consequence of the false and concerted misrepresentations;
and would not have been made, if the truth had not been suppressed
by the conspiracy.
It is contended, that such an agreement will be held fr4udulent
everywhere; and that, -in such a case, tjhe fraud has no locality.
If two individuals were to conspire, in a foreign country, to obtain
money from a third party, either by highway robbery or theft, or
by cheating of any dehcription; and under the conspiracy, one of
them were to obtain the money of the third party; it would scarcely
be contended, that under such an agreement, the other could claim
from his associate in the conspiracy a share of the pljhmdec, throfugh
the instrumentality of a Court of justice. It is contended that there
is no difference between such a case, and a conspiracy tocheat a
government: and that such 'aconspiracy is essentially different as
it regards its validity in our Courts, from contracts made for the Purpose of evading the revenue laws, or the mere commercial regula-

285

[Do Valengin's Administrators vs. Duffy.]

tions of a foreign country; when to invalidate such a contract would
be substantially to enforce such laws and regulations.
It is contended, also, that not only was such an agreement void;
and that thereby the principal fact on which the Court instructed the
jury in favour of the plaintiff in the Circuit Court was removed
from the case; but that the existence of such an agreement necessarily prevented a recovery from the plaintiffs in error: as it would
have precluded a recovery against De Valengin, if he had obtained
the money from the Brazilian government.
The case put on-the whole of the proof of the*defendant in error,
established this fraudulent agreement, and showed that the money
had been obtained by false documents, furnished by John H. Duffy,
or obtained by his aid and with his privity.
The property thus coming into the possession of the aaministrator,
the effect of this action was and is to repudiate the plaintiff's own
fraudulent documents, evidencing title in De Valengin; and to reclaim the property by force of the agreement to-pay over the money
to him when recovered. The action could only be maintained upon
the agreement to pay over the money when received; he having
parted with' the title for the fraudulent purpose.: this agreement to
pay over was a part and parcel of the corrupt and fraudulent agreement, which could not be severed from the latter, nor established
without proof of it. The case, therefore, fell within the scope of the
well established principle, "that when recovery cannot be had ex-,
cept by proof of the illegal or corrupt. agreement, or through the
medium, of it'- it cannot be had at all."
The counsek for the plaintiffs in error also contended, that the proof
of the fraudulent agreement showed conclusiv-Aly that the defendant
in error had no title to the money sought to be recovered: that by
his own showing, the title to it was in the Brazilian government;
that the money sought to be recovered was not, and never had bden
his property or the proceeds of his property: but was, on the contrary,
a sum of money originally belonging to the Brazilian government,
and obtained by fraud from it; and the proof of the fraud furnished
by himself, and shown in the agreement supposed by the prayer,
established that the title was still' in the said government, and not
in the defendant in error.
Upon the second proposition, as stated in the opinion of the Court,
that the action would not lie against Neale as administrator, nor th
money be assets in hisl hands, of the estate df De Valengin; that
the return of Neale to the Orlihans Court cannot change the character of the transaction; and that the action shoukd have been continued against Neale's administrator, and not against the plaintiffs in
error: the counsel for *the.plaintiffs -n error contended
I
The otily pretence of claim against the estate of De Valengin and
the plaintiffs in error, as administrators de bonis non of his estate,
is founded on the allegation that Neale, in his lifetime, received the
proceeds'of property which did not belong to De.Valengin, but in
fact belonged to the defendant in error, John H. Duffy; and had

286

.SUPREME COURT.
[De Valengin's Administrators vs. Duffy.)

wrongfully carried it into the estate of which he was administrator.
The administrator could not, by a wrongful receipt or conversion
of property which did not belong to th6 intestate, create a debt
against the intestate, or charge against the estate of the intestate,
-which ,enables the owner of the property to come in as a general
creditor against the estate. The administrator alone is personally
liable for suchwrongful receipt or conversion; even where the property has gone to the benefit of the estate.
This is established by numerous and uncontradicted decisions,
which settle it beyond controversy, that upon a count for money
had and received by an administrator, no other judgment cart be
rendered than the judgment de bonis propriis; and-that such a count
cannot be joined with any counts on an indebtedness of the intestate,
or with any indebtedness of the administrator; pis such; such as money paid for the use of the estate, &c., which does create a debt
against the estate. Cited, Jennings vs. Newman, 4 D. andEast,

Even if there was any remedy against the estate in such a case,
it would be found only in the right to follow and reclaim the specific
property so wrongfully carried into the estate, by a proceeding for
the specific recovery of it, or by a special claim against the estate
founded on the allegation that the property had been carried into
the estate and appropriated to its uses: and this, even if the recovery
could not be had against the estate, through the medium of the mere
common count for money had and received by the administrator.
There was no foundation for any such claim against the estate, as
it was conceded that Neale died after having sold the property and
received the proceeds, and that no part of the said proceeds had ever
been paid over to the plaintiffs in error, or accounted for to them
either by Neale in his lifetime, or by his administrators since his
death: and the plaintiff had therefore an ample remedy against
Neale's administrators for, the recovery of the money. It was
insisted that the mere return of it in an inventory by Neale, could
vary the question; not only because he could not by his mere act
of charging himself with it to the estate, make the estate a debtor
therefor to the owners: but also because the recovery by title paramount, in an action by Duffy against Neale, or his administrators,
would have been a full protection against any claim founded on the
*mere return in the inventory. There is nothing in the Maryland act
of 1820, ch .174, to change the common law rules on this subject,
(as was supposed in the Court below,) or even to bring it within the
operation of that act as expounded by the Courts of Maryland, in
Sibley vs. Williams, 3 Gill and Johnson, 63, 64: and that there was
no evidence in the cause to show that the money, received by Neale

[De Valengin's Administrators vs. Duffy.]

on the sales was in such a predicament, that the plaintiffs 'in error or
administrators de bonis non could have pursued and recovered the
money, according to the construction of that act in the case just referred to: and that the plaintiff's remedy as to assets, in such a
predicament, was against Neale's estate, or on his bond.
Mr. Williams, for the defendant in error.
By the laws of Maryland, administrators de bonis non are entitled,
and their duty requires them to demand from the legal epresentatives of the former, administrator, the delivery over to them of all
bonds, notes, accounts, and evidences of debt, and to require the
payment over of all money, belonging to the original estate. And
such bonds, &c. and money are assets in the hands of thO administrators de bonis non. LAws of Maryland, 1798, ch. 101, sub ch. 14,
sec. 2; 1820, ch. 174, sec. 3-5.

It is, accordingly, not only the right, but the duty of the plaintiffs
in error, to demand from Neale's representatives the monfey and
property, admitted by him in his lifetime to be in his hands, as the
estate of De Valengin. The representatives of Neale cannot claim.,
this property as a part of his estate. Nor can the new administrators of De Valengin reject it as forming no part of De VaWeigin's
estate.
If the administrators de bonis non have neglected, and are neglecting to perform their duty in not calling on Neale's representatives for a delivery over of the property of their intestate; they can.
be compelled, by application to the proper tribunal, to discharge
their duty in this particular.
In the meantime it cannot be an objection, to be urged by the
delinquent parties themselves, that they have failed in their duty.
Nor, surely, ought it to worc a loss or an injury to Duffy,; that he
has presumed they have fulfilled, or will fulfil the obligations pirescribed by law in this respect.
And, further, if Duffey had the alternative, as he doubtless had,
under the circumstances of this case, to treat Neale in his individual
character as his debtor; he most clearly had a right to embrace the
moie disadvantageous alternative of regarding De Valengin's estate
as his debtor. In adopting the latuer alternative, as has been before
remarked, it cannot belong to the plaintifi in error to falsify Neale's
admission; and deny that to be their intestate estate, which the first
administrator declares on oath to be such. There is as little grace,
as there is law, in placing themselves in sich attitude. 2 Will. Ex.

As to the assumption of the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, that
the contract between De Valengin and the defendant was fraudulent and immoral, under which the indemnity for the cargo of the
President Adams was claimed from the Brazilian government, and
therefore cannot be made the subject of a suit in a Court of the United
States; the counsel for the defendant in error said, that it assumes
that in a Court of the United States, between citizens of the United

because the capturing power chooses to waive its right to condethn,
or 'because the residence of its true owner is unknown, it ought
clearly to enure to the benefit of the true owner against all the rest
of the world. It would be monstrous, and against all law and justice
to allow the other contracting party, who has participated in the
seizure, to claim that as his own which he admits to be another's;

-Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case comes here, upon a writ of error to the Circuit Court
for the District of Maryland.
It appears from the record, that John H. Dunly, 'an American
citizen, being engaged in commerce and domiciled at Buenos Ayres,
snipped a cargo of hides and lard to Gibraltar, on.board the brig
President Adams, in 1828. Buenos Ayres was then at war with
Brazil. The President Adams was an American vessel; and De
Valengin, her captain, was a citizen of the United States. He was
also part owner of the vessel.
In order to protect the cargo from capture by the Brazilians, it
was shipped as-the property of De Valengin; and the bill of lading,
and other papers in relation to it, were made out. in his name. The
brig was, however, capiured on her voyage by a Brazilian cruiser,
and was wrecked; and the vessel:and cargo totally lost, near Monte
Video, while in possession of the captors; who were endeavouring
to carry her into port.
De Valengin being, the ostensible owner of the cargo; he,. with
the consent of Duffy, prosecuted a claim for remuneration from the
Brazilian government; insisting that the property belonged to him;
that it was neutral property, and therefore, tmlawfully captured.
De Valengin died before he recovered any thing; and after his
death, James Neale 'took out letters of administration on his estate,,

JANUARY TERM,. 1840.

289

[Do Valengin's Administratoro vs. Duffy.]

in the city of, Baltimore,. and continued to prosecute the claim upor
the ground that the property was De Valengin's; and at length succeeded in obtaining compensation for it from the Brazilian government. The money was paid to Neale's agent at Rio de Janeiro, and
invested in coffee, and shipped to him to Baltimore ; where he received and took possession of it as property belonging to.DeValengin's estate, and as his administrator. It was duly appraised as
the property of De Valengin, and returned as such by Neale, to, the
Orphans Court, in January, 1834; and afterwards was sold by him,
and the money received. It does not appear from the evidence,
whether Neale had or had not any knowledge of the interest of
Duffy in the cargo, while he was prosecuting the claim against the
Brazilian government; or when he received the compensation for it.
In March, 1834, Duffy brought suit against Neale for the morley
he had thus received. The suit was against Neale as administator of De Valengin. In 1836, Neale died, the suit being still pending; and after his death, process was issued against the present
plaintiffs in error; who are the administrators de bonis non of De
Valengin; in'order to make them defendants to the suit which he
had instituted against Neale in his lifetime, as administrator as
aforesaid.
The declaration was amended by the plaintiff after the appearance of the administrators de bonis non; and the only count applicable to tfie case, as it appears. in the testimony, was that for money
had and received by Neale, as administrator of De Valengin, to and
for the use of the plaintiff. The defendants pleaded non assumpsit
and plene administravit, upon which issues were joined; and
the jury four 1 for the plaintiff on the first issue,and for the. de'fendants on the second; and the judgment was entered-for the
amount found due by the jury in the usual form, to bind assets
when they shall arise.
At the trial, several instructions were asked for by the defendanis,
which were refused by the Court. They may all, however, be resolved into two. 1. That the agreement between De Valengin and
Duffy, to claim remuneration from the Brazilian government, upon
the ground that it was neutral property, when in truth it was
Duffy's, and therefore, belligerent, and liable to capture by the laws
of nations, was fraudulent and immoral; and thit the Courts of justice of this country, will not assist a party to recover money due on
such an agreement.
2. That if the money belonged to Duffy, the action would not lie
against Neale as administrator, nor the money be assets in his hands,
of De Valengin's estate ; that his return to the Orphans Court cannot alter the character of the transaction; and that the suit ought
to have been continued against Neale's administrator, and not against
the representatives of De Valengin.
The first question may be disposed of in a few words. It has
been frequently held, that the device practised in this case, of
covering the property as neutral when in truth it was belligerent,
VOL. XIV.-2 B

37

290

SUPREME COURT.
[De Valengia's Administrators vs. Duffy.]

is not contrary to the. laws of war, or the laws of nations. And
contracts made with underwriters in relation to property thus
covered, have always been enforced in the C ourts of a neutral
country, when the true character of the property and the means
taken to protect it from capture, have been fairly represented to the
insurer. The same*doctrine has always been held where false
papers were used to cover the property;, provided the underwriter
knew or was bound to know that such stratagemns were always resorted to by persons engaged in that trade. And if such means
may be used to prevent a capture, there can be no good reason for
condemning with more severity, the continuation of the same lisguise after capture, in order to prevent the condemnation of the
property, or to procure compensation for it, when it has been lost
by reason of the capture. It is true the Courts of the capturing
nation would never enforce contracts of that description ; 'but they
have always been regarded as lawful.in the Courts of a neutral
country.
The second question is one of more nicety, and the cases are not
entirely reconcilable to each other. There are,.doubtless, decisions
which countenance the doctrine that no action will lie against an
executor or administrator, in 'his representative character, except
upon some claim or demand which existed against the testator or
intestate in his lifetime; and that if the claim or demand wholly
accrued in the time of the executor or administrator, he is liable
therefor, only in his personal character, But'upon a full conSideration of the nature, and of the various decisions on the subject, we
are of opinion, that whatever property or money is lawfully recovered or received by the executor or, administrator, after the
death of his testator or intestate in virtue of his, representative character, he holds as assets of the estate ; and he is liable therefor, in
such representative character to the party who has a good title
thereto. In our judgment, this, upon principle, must be the true
doctrine.
In the case of a factor who sells the goods of his 'principal in
his own name, upon acredit, and dies before the money is received,
if it is afterwards paid to the administrator in his representative
character; would not the creditor be entitled to consider it as assets
in his hands, and to charge him in the same character in which he
received it? The want of knowledge, or the possession of knowledge on the part'of the administrator, as to the rights or claims of
other persons upon the money thus received, cannot alter the rights
of the party to whom it is ultimately'due. The debtor, that is to
say, the party who purchased from the factor without any knowledge of the true owfer, and who pays the money to- the administrator under the belief-that the goods belonged to the factor himself,
is unquestionably discharged by'this payment. Yet he cannot be
discharged unlesshe pays it to one lawfully authorized to receive
it; and the party to whom he. pays cannot be lawfully authorized
to receive, except only in his representative character. If he is

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

291

[De Valengin's Administrators vs. Duffy.]

authorized to receive in that character, why should he not be liable
in that character ?
Again, if a note had been taken by the factor, payable to himself,
and after his death his administrator sued upon it in his representativecapacity, and recovered the money; would he not be liable to
the principal, in the same character in which he had, by the judgment of a Court recovered the money? It would be difficult to
reconcile the contrary doctrine to any sound principles of reason, or
to find any countenance for it in analogous cases.
We do not mean to say, that the principal may not, in such cases,
resort to the administrator in his personal character, and charge him,
de bonis propriis, with the amount thus received. We think he
may take either course, at his election; but that whenever an executor or administrator, in his representative character, lawfully received money or property, he may be compelled to respond to the
party entitled in that character; and shall not be permitted to throw
it off after he has received the money, in order to defeat the plaintiff's action.
In this case, De Valengin was the bailee of the goods shipped by
Duffy, and had a special property in them; and it was his duty to
take all proper measures for their safety and preservation. He had
a right to sell and transfer the goods in his own name, and as his
own property. The Brazilian government, by agreeing to pay me
poney, admitted that the debt was justly due to him on account ot
the destruction of this cargo. Whether that government was deceived or not, is another question; and does not affect the point now
to be decided, The admission of the debt as due to De Valengin,
places this case upon the same principles with that of a factor before
mentioned, who had sold the property of his principal in his own
name, and died before the receipt of the money. If the administrator is lawfully entitled to receive it in his representative chardLcter,
and does so receive it, he is liable, in the same character, to the party
entitled. Neale prosecuted the claim, and received the money, as
the administrator of De Valengin. He must account for it in the
same
cbaracter.
If this
transaction had taken place before the act of Assembly of
Maryland, of 1820, ch. 174, the suit must inquestionably have been
continued against Neale's representatives, and could not have been
sustained against the administrators de bonis non of De Valengin.
Because the property which Neale had received as administrator
was converted into money in his lifetime, and must therefore have
been accounted for by his administrator, and would not have passed
to the administrator de bonis non of the former intestate. But by
the third section of the act of 1820,,ch. 174, the administrator de
bonis non, is entitled to the bonds, notes, accounts, and evidences of
debt, whieh the deceased executor or administrator may have taken,
and to the money in his hands in his representative character; and
he is authorized to recover them in the manner there pointed out'
And the money now in controversy being, as we have already said,

292

SUPREME, COURT.
[De Valengin's Administrators vs. Duffy.]

lawfully in the hands of Neale, in his representative character, the
administrators de bonis non are entitled to it; and as they are
authorized to recover the fund out of which the money due to Duffy
is to be paid, he had a right to make them parties to the suit which
he had instituted against the first administrator, and to continue it
against them. They are not injured, or in any manner placed in
danger by this proceeding. For they are not. liable,, unless the
money is recovered from Neale's representatives or securities; prois no negligence or breach of duty on their part.

The there
motion in arrest of judgment offered in the Circuit Court,
if
it had not been objectionable upon other grounds, was evidently too
late by the rules of the Court; and, on that account, properly overruled.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore affirmed.
This cause came on to be heardork the transcript of the record
from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Maryland, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it
is ordered and adjudged by this Court, that the judgment of the said
Circuit Court, in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed,
with costs and damages, at the, rate of six per centum per annum.
