JOHN PETERS, AND JOHN PETERS, JR., PLAINTIFFS, vs. THE WARREN
INSURANCE COMPANY, DEFENDANTS.
Insurance. Insurance was made to the amount of eight thousand dollars on the ship
Paragon, for one year. The policy contained the usual risks, and among others, that of
the perils of the sea. The assured claimed for a loss by collision with another vessel,
without any fault of the master or crew of the Paragon; and also insisted on a general
average and contribution. The Paragon was in part insured; and in November, 1836,
in the year during which the policy was in operation, she sailed from Hamburgh, in bal.
last, for Gottenburgh, for a cargo of iron, for the United States. While proceeding down
the Elbe, with a pilot on board, she came in contact with a galliot, and sunk her. She
lost her bowsprit, jib-boom, and anchor, and was otherwise damaged, and put into Cuxhaven, a port at the mouth of the Elbe, and in the jurisdiction of Hamburgh. The cap-.
tain of the galliot libelled the Paragon, alleging that the loss of his vessel was caused by
the carelessness or fault of those on board the Paragon. Upon the hearing of the tause,
the Court decided that the collision was not the result of the fault or carelessness of either
side; and that therefore, according to the marine law of Hamburgh, the loss was a general average loss, and to be borne equally by both parties; that is, that the Paragon was to
bear one-half of the expense of her own repairs, and to pay one-half of the value of the
galliot; and that the galliot was to bear the loss' of the half of her own value, and to
pay one-half of the repairs of the Paragon. The result of this decree was, that the
Paragon was to pay two thousand six hundred dollars, being one-half of the value of
the galliot, (three thousand dollars,) after deducting one-half of her own repairs, being
four hundred dollars. The owners of the Paragon, having no funds in Hamburgh, the
captain was obliged to raise the money on bottomry. There being no cargo on board the
Paragon, and no-freight earned, the Paragon was obliged to bear the whole loss. Held,
that the assured were entitled to recover.
A loss by collision, without any fault on either side, is a loss by the perils of the sea, within
the protection of the policy of insurance. So far as the injury and repairs done to the
Paragon itself extend, the underwriters are liable for all damages.
The rule, that underwriters are liable only for losses arising from the proximate cause of
the loss, and not for losses arising from a remote cause, not immediately connected with
the peril, is correct; when it is understood and applied in its true sense: and as such, it
has been repeatedly recognised in this Court.
The law of insurance, as a practical science, does not indulge in niceties. It seeks to
administer justice according to the fair interpretation of the intention of the parties; and
deems that to be a loss within the policy which is a natural and necessary consequence
of the peril insured against.
If there be any commercial contract which more than any other requires the application of
sound common sense and practical reasoning in the exposition of it, and in the uniformity
of the applicAtion of rules to it, it is certainly a policy of insurance.
It has been held by learned foreign writers on the law of insurance, that whenevei the
thing insured becomes by law directly chargeable with any expense, contribution, or loss,
in consequence of a particular peril; the law treats the peril, for all practical purposes, as
the proximate cause of such expense, contribution, or loss. This they hold, upon the
general principles of law, applicable to the contract of insurance. In the opinion of the
Supreme Court, this is the just sense and true interpretation of the contract.
In all foreign voyages, the underwriters, necessarily, have it in contemplation that the vessel
insured must, or at least may be, subjected to the operation of the laws of the foreign
ports which are visited. Those very laws may in some cases impose burdens, and jnt
some cases give benefits, different from our laws; and yet there are cases under policies
of insurance, where it is admitted the foreign law will govern the rights of the parties,
and not the domestic law. Such is the known case of general average, settled in a
foreign port according to the local law; although it may differ from our own law.

States, for the District of Massachusetts.

SUPREME COURTa
[Peters vs. The Warren Insurance Company.]

This was a case on a policy of insurance, dated the 1st of April,
1836, whereby the defendants insured the plaintiffs, for whom it
may concern, payable to them, eight thousand dollars on the ship
Paragon, for, the term of one year; commencing the risk on the 15th
day of March, 1836, at noon, at a premium of five per cent. The
declaration alleged a loss by collision with another vessel, without
any, fault of the master or crew of the Paragon; and also insisted
on a general average and contribution.
The parties agreed that the verdict should be rendered by the
jury for the plaintiff or for the defendants, according to the opinion
of. the Court, upon the matters of law arising upon the following
statement of the facts of the case. The plaintiffs are the owners of
the ship Paragon, insured by the defendants in part.
On the lOth of November, 1836, the vessel sailed from Hamburgh,in ballast, for Gottenburgh, to procure a cargo of iron, for
the United States.
Whilst proceeding down the Elbe, with a-pilot on board, she came
in contact 'witA a galliot called Frau Anna, and sunk her. The'Par~gon lost her bowsprit, jib-boom, and anchor,.and sustained other
damages, which obliged her: to go into Cuxhaven, a port at the
mouth of the Elbe, and subject to the jurisdictioff of Hamburgh,
for repairs.
Whilst lying there, the captain of the galliot libelled the Paragon
in the Marine Court, alleging that the loss of the vessel was caused
bythe carelessness or fault of those on board thd Paragon. The
ship was arrested; but subsequently released on security being given
by the agents of the owners, to respond to such damages as should
be awarded by the Court.
The captain of.the Paragon, in his answer, denied the charges of
carelessness or fault on the part of those on board of his ship; and
the Court, after hearing the parties and their proof, decided -that the
collision was not the result of fault or carelessness on either-side ;
and that therefore, according to article first, title eighth, of the Marine Law of Hamburgh, the loss was-a general average loss, and to
be borne equally by each party: that is, the Paragon wAs to bear
one-half of the expense of her own repairs, and to pay one-half of
the -value of the galliot; and the galliot was to bear the loss of onehalf of her own value, and to pay one-half of the expense of the
repairs of the Paragon. In conformit, with this decision, a general
average stmement was drawn up by Mr. Oldermann, the Despacheur
of Hamburgh; an officer appointed by law, and by whom alone
such statements can be prepared,.
In this statement are charged, first, the expenses of repairing the
,Paragon, after making the deduction of one-third new for old, saving one of her anchors and chains, which was lost at the time of the
collision; wages and provisions of.the captain and the crew, during
the- detention, and the expenses of surveys, protest, defending the
suit, &c., amounting in all to about eight hundred dollars, and onehalf of which is charged to.the Paragon, and one-half to the galliot.

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

101

[Peters vs. the Warren Insurance Company.]

Secondly, are charged the value of the galliot, as by appraisal
under an order of Court, of her freight and cargo, the expenses of
surveys, protest, prosecuting the suit, &c., amountin& in all to about
six thousand dollars, one-half of which is to be charged to the
Paragon.
The statement concludes thus :." Which according to
the before
mentioned ordinance relating to insurance and average, is to be
borne by ship, cargo, and freight, as general average. The ship
Paragon. has to claim from the Frau Anna, for half the damages,.
say
$400
And the Friu Anna from the Paragon, one-half the damages,-say
$3,000
So that the Paragon must pay
2,600"
Which amount the Tribunal of Commerce decreed should be paid
instanter,
The owners of the Paragon, having no funds in Hamburgh, the
Captain was obliged to raise the money on bottomry.
There being' no cargo on board of the Paragon, and no freight
earned, the ship has to bear the whole of the general average loss.
The judges of the Circuit Court were opposed in opinion on the
following point and question, viz. "whether, in this case, the contributory amount pai-d by the Paragon. on account of the collision,
was a direct, positive, and proximate effect from the accident, in
such sense as to render the defendants liable therefor upon this
policy,"
And on the point and question aforesaid, at the request of the
defendants, the same was- stated by the said judges, and under their
direction as aforesaid, it was ordered to be certified under the seal of
the said, Circuit Court to the Supreme Court of the United States, at
their next session, to be by the said Court finally decided.
The case was submitted to the Court on printed arguments by
Mr. Webster for the plaintiff; and Mr. Theophilus Parsons for the
defendants.
Mr. Parsons for the defendants.
The principal question in this case is, whether the amount paid
on account of the collision between the vessels, is a direct, positive,
and proximate effect from the accident.
We do not undertake to say that there are no contracts in which
th&remota cahisa spectatur, but certainly the law of insurance looks
only at the proximate cause. Is the collision, then, in this case, a
remote, or a proximate cause? If the law of Hamburgh is the
proximate cause, and the collision the remote cause, then we are
clearly discharged; because we do not insure against the law of
Hamburgh, nor against any remote cause. But we do insure against
collision, and the question, therefore, now takep this shape : is the
law of Hamburgh, with its requirement of contribution, to be taken
as apart of the act of collision?

1 2

SUPREME COURT.
[Peters vs. The Warren Insurance Company.]

If these questions are to be settled rather by the common sense than
by the metaphysics of the law, then it would seem to' be clear, that
the collision here is the remote cause; for another cause, to wit, the
law of Hamburgh, comes between the collision and the contribution;.
and nbt only so, but it is this law which actually causes the contribution., The collision, then, is not the proximate cause, for that is
proximate which lies nearest; and here another cause is interposed,
and thus lies nearer.
How are the authorities? In this country it is a new question,
and there are no cases which bear very strongly upon it. But in
England, just this question occurred very recently, and was fully
reported in the fourth volume of Adolphus and Ellis, p. 420, Do
Vaux vs. Salvador. This case, interesting both from its novelty
and its importance, was fully considered, first, by Lord Denman,
atd then by the Court of Queen'sBench, on a motion for a new
trial; and the-decision was fully and pointedly for the defence, on
precisely the grounds we have taken here. Nothing can be more
exact than the analogy, between that case and this; nothing more
precise and definite ; and as we think, nothing can be more reasonable, than the principles upon which this case is decided in England. Will this Court decide precisely the same case, on precisely
opposite grounds? Some of the continental authorities may seem
to be against us. But, not to dwell on the circumstance, that their
whole "doctrine of contract" rests upon the civil law, and that the
difference, in this' respect, between their law and ours, greatly
weakens their authority, as precedents for us; not to dwell on this;
it is very important to remember, that they, as Emerigon and the
rest, decide that insurers shall repay the contribution ; but they
decide under the influence of the law which requires -the contribution. That is, on the continent, generally perhaps, a rule like that
of Hamburgh, dividing the loss from collision, between two innocent-vessels, prevails. To the continental writers it is familiar;
they are accustomed to the law, and to all the usages going with
the taw, which law is perfectly well known there by everybody;
and it is very natural that they should hold insurers liable for the
contribution, as if it were a component part of the collision : very
.natural, and perhaps, very right. Not sowith the English"Courts,
'or our own: for here the law so dividing this loss, is unknown; we
have none here, and our citizens make their bargains under no such
contemplation; and therefore, the Courts of England decide rightly
there, and our Courts should decide like those of England, and
unlike the continental writers, because our laws and usages are
like those of England, in respect to the liabilities of vessels in cases
of collision, and unlike those of the continent. And our laws in
respect to the liabilities of the vessels being alike, so should our laws
be in respect to the obligations and implied contracts of insurers, in
regard to that contract. We insured against damage to the Paragon;
but we did not insure against damage to any other vessel.
But there is another view of this subject, which seems to us per-

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

103

[Peters vs. The Warren Insurance Company.]

fectly decisive The continental authorities not only decide under
the influence of their laws, but their policies differ from ours in this
precise partidular. They all contain, 'inthe enumeration of the
risks, "accidental running foul." A French policy is .in this form,
and the Court are respectfully referred to it. In this policy, the
phrase is, "abordage fortuit ;", nd phrases of similar import are
in the policies of Amsterdam and 11amburgh; which are all the
continental policies we have seen.
From this it will be obvious, that the only authority where
policies like our own were before the Court-that is, the high authority of the English Cotirts-is directly and most explicitly adverse to .the claim of the plaintiffs. While the continental authorities, when they seem to favour it, are adjudicating upon policies
Which differ from ours in this precise respect, they refer to policies which, unlike ours, provide expressly for fhis very case. If
would seem, therefore, that the force of these continental authorities is at once annihilated.
The rule, causa proxima non remota spectatur, is stronger in
England than on the continent; stronger here than in England: the
Supreme Court at Washington having settled it repeatedly and
firmly. See Petapsco Insurance Company vs. Coulter, 3 Peters, 222.Also, Columbian Insurance Company vs. Lawrence, 10 Peters,
507. Also, Waters vs. Merchants' Louisville Insurance Company,
11 Peters, 213.
But let us look at these foreign authorities more closely.
The ordinances which make the insurers liable ire the same
which require equal contribution in the case of collision 'without
fault. Andl this may be right. Thus, in the Modern Code of Commerce, in France, article 50 touches the insurer; article 407 regulates the effects of collision. This is right. 'The liability of the
insurer should be conterminous with the liability of an 'innocent
vessel. Where an innocent vessel is held by law liable for half the
injury of collision, there the insurer should be held to make it good.
But nowhere else. It seems, however, that a very serious question
exists in France, as to the liability of insurers to pay for damages,
where the collision arises from a fault which cannot be clearly put
upon either party: and this doubt has arisen from the fact that the
Code does not speak precisely upon this point, but expressly makes
the insurers liable only where the collision is wholly forthitous or
without any fault. This doubt, or difference* of opinion, goes
strongly to show that the opinion of the continental writers is
based upon, and most closely connected with their own ordinances;
and thus it takes greatly, if not entirely, away the force of their
authority, over contracts made in countries where no such law is
known; and it leaves in full power the distinct English authority,
which is made under laws and usages, and upon policies that are
like our own.
If this case is to be likened to other cases of injury from supposed causes, we should suppose any such analogy favourable to

104

SUPREME COURT.
[Peters vs. The Warren Insurance Company.]

us. Thus, it is perfectly well known3 that at Buenos Ayres, and in
the East, at Sumatra, and in a Chinese port, it has actually happened, and more than once, and the newspapers of the land were
full of the story, that for a collision or some mischief done or supposed to be done, by officers or crew, the ship has been seized, and
only restored on payment of a heavy ransom; but nobody ever
heard of a call on an insurance company for any such loss. Can
the case be supposed to resemble rather a case of salvage ? It is
true, that the loss by salvage, or by costs of Court, is always cast upon
underwriters; though there the peril of the sea may be thought, in
some sense, the remote cause, and the law the proximate cause.
But there is a very great difference between these cases, and one
that wholly destroys the analogy. The costs of Court, and the payment of.salvage, belong to the universal law of insurance. Every
man who insures or is insured anywhere, does so under the law
of salvage ; and his contract, therefore, acknowledges and respects
this law. But it is just otherwise in the present case.
There is another material difference. In the present case, the
contribution is in the nature of penalty, or at least, a satisfaction
and compensation made by this vessel to the other. Not so with
salvage. That proceeds wholly upon the theory, that it is for the
benefit of the wrecked or endangered vessel, and therefore, for the
insurers upon the vessel: and. this principle is repeated in almost
every case of salvage, as the reason why more is given to the
salvors than mere wages, or compensation for time and labour.
And these, remarks lead us to the more general view of the case,
and to what, we cannot but think, ought to be the governing and
determining principle of it, namely, that where an accident occurs
which is clearly insured against-a collision for instance-then all
those consequences thereof are to be taken as parts of the same
thing and as belonging to the collision, which flow from it by as natural and obvious, or inevitable consequences, or which are caused by
a universal or general lawv, to which all parties to the insurance are
supposed to refer equally in their contract. And all other consequences of the collision, except such as these, are to be considered
as not necessary and component parts of the accident, but as connected with it by some local law, or some peculiar circumstance;
and are, therefore, not to be considered as insured against by
parties, who could not be supposed to have contemplated or anticipated them. This last point seems to us to contain the whole gist
of the matter; nor can we perceive how the Court can admit the
plaintiff's claim, without distinctly contravening their own uniform
and well-established decisions.
It may be proper to advert briefly to one other point. It may be
suggested that the defendants are bound by the settlement in Hamburgh, as by a foreign adjustment of general average. But the
distinction upon thatpoint is perfectly clear and well settled. It is
this: No foreign adjustment can determine for us, what is a general
average; but it may settle, definitively as between all the parties, that

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

105

[Peters re, The Warren Insurance Company.]

general average which is one by our own law, and has certainly
happened. In other words, we can always go behind a foreign
adjustment of general average, and deny that the facts happened,
or that, if they happened, they constituted a general average; but
if facts certainly occurred, which by our own law of insurance
constitute a general average, then the adjustment in the foreign
port is binding upon all the interests. But it is perfectly clear that
this is not the present case, and that by our law of insurance, the
facts in the present case would not constitute a general average.
Mr. Webster, in reply to the argument for the defendants, submitted to the Court, that it appeared to him that the first positions
maintained by the counsel for the insurance company were questionable, to the extent claimed by him. He says, that however it
may be in regard to some other contracts, the law of insurance looks
only at the proximate cause of loss. That this is generally true,
may be admitted ; but it is not universally true.
If the proposition were universal, it woula certainily exclude salvage. Mr. Parson's answer to this, is, that the payment of' salvage
is a loss, by the universal law of insurance. This is so : and this
proves, not that no case of loss by a remote cause -is within the law
of insurance, but, on the contrary, that one such case, at least, is
within that law by universal consent. The same may be said of
costs incurred in the course of judicial proceedings, and of payments
on account of general average.
Mr. Parsons admits that collision is insured against, and that all
consequences may be regarded as belonging to it which flow naturally from it, or which are caused by a general law, to which all parties may be supposed to have referred. But how can he distinguish,
or what reason is given for a distinction, between consequences
which immediately arise from natural causes, and those which arise
as immediately from the operation of the laws.of the place ? A ship
suffers collision ; the immediate natural effect is injury to her frame.
The necessity of an expenditure for repais is immediately inflicted
upon her; and for this expenditure, the underwriter is liable. Another ship suffers a collision, and does injury to the vessel in which
she has come in contact, without fault. The immediate consequence, by the law of the place, is a charge on the ship, creating a
lien, for a contribution to the loss; and this charge causes the "necessity of 'an expenditure. It is not easy to perceive a rea son why
one of these cases should be within the policy, and the other not
within it. The loss, in the latter case, is a consequence of the accident, as necessary, as certain, and as unavoidable as that inthe first.
The charge becomes attached to the ship; is an encumbrance, hindering her from the prosecution of her voyage; keeping her where
she is, and removable only by an expenditure. It is an obvious
consequence of the accident; and, in the language of Mr. Parsons,
an-" inevitable" consequence. The party entitled to the contribution is as sure to claim it, as the carpenter who makes repairs* is to
14

106

SUPREME COURT.
[Peters vs. The Warren Insurance Company.]

demand- payment. The expenditure is as inevitable in one case as
in Mr.
the other.
Parsons supposes that the continental authorities are
the less
to be regarded, as the policies in those countries are different. Thus,

he says, that "acci d entally running foul" is one of the specifically
enumerated causes of loss in a French policy. Be it so. But that
fact does not help to settle the question, what loss is to jbe regarded
as the proper consequence of running foul. "Running foul," or
collision, it will not be denied, is as completely within this policy, as
within a French policy; and the form or particular words of the
policy, in either case, do not affect or touch the question now in con.
troversy. How can it be said that the French policies provide for
this very case ? Do they expressly provide for the case of contribution for collision ? They certainly do not. They ooly mention collision, leaving' the law to settle what losses arise from it, and how
these losses are to be settled. "This very case," in the, language
of my learned brother, is not a case in which any question is made,
whether a loss by collision is within a policy, Americ;Ln, English,
or French. It is admited to be within them all. The question,
and the only question, in this case, is, whether the loss which has
actually happened, is or is not a loss by collision. And how, then,
is the force of those continental authorities, which declare that losses
like this are losses by collision, annihilated ? Th'e slightest reason
is not seen to suppose that the decisions of the continental writers
have been founded, either on the forms of the policies in use on the
continent, or on any ordinances. The law pf the place imposes contribution in cases of collision. The continental writers are authorities to show that it follows, not from any ordinance or from any
particulztr words in continental policies, buf from the general law
of insurance, and the reason of the thing, that the discharge of this
contribution is a loss, occasioned by collision.
Many cases might be put to establish the construction for which
we contendi.
The case of capture is one. If a neutral ship, insured against
capture, be actually captured, carried in, and released, on payment
of costs and expenses to the captors, (a very common case,) these
costs and expenses are always held to be within the policy.
Suppose, again, that perishable articles, like provisions, are slightly
injured by a storm, less than to the extent of five per cent., but that,
before the vessel reaches her port, the effect: of time, acting on the
goods thus slightly injured, is such as to destroy all their value. Is
there any doubt that, in such a case, the whole loss is to be referred
to the storm, and so brought within the policy ?
And, in regard to the converse of the case now befo'e the Court,
allow the inquiry, what would have been thought of the rights
of the parties, if the galliot herself had not been injured, blit had
injured the Paragon to the extent of a thousand dollars: and suppose the owners of the galliot paid one-half of this sum to the
master of the Paragon i could the plaintiffs in this suit have recovered

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

107

[Peters v8. The Warren Insurance Company.]

more than the balance? Could they pocket what they had received
from the galliot, and recover the whole amount of the injury from
the defendants?
With a general remark, these observations are closed.
This vessel was insured on time. The commerce of the world
was open to her. She was to choose her own track, from nation to
nqation, or from zone to, zone. She was expected, therefore, to fall
under the dominion of various codes, and different laws 1and to cqnform, as of necessity she must, to them all, as shd should come within
the sphere of their respective influences. She must encounter the
dangers which belong to the place where she is, or where she goes;
and while acting fairly, and in good faith, ought to be protected, as
within the policy.
Mr. Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is the case of a division of opinion, certified to this Court by
the judges of the Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts.
The defendant, by a policy of insurance, dated the 1st of April,
1836, insured the plaintiffs, for whom it may concern, payable to
them, eight thousand dollars, on the ship Paragon, for the term
of one year, commencing the risk on the 13th of March, 1836, at
noon, at five per cent. The policy contained the usual risks, and
among others, that of perils of the sea. The declaration alleged a
loss, by collision with another vessel, without any fault of the master or crew of the Paragon; and also insisted on a general average
and contribution. The parties at the trial agreed upon a statement
of facts; by which it appeared that the Paragon was owned by the
plaintiffs, and was in part insured by the defendants, by the policy
above mentioned. On the 10th- of November, 1836, the Paragon
sailed from Hamburgh, in ballast, for Gottenburgh, to procure a cargo
of iron for the United States. While proceeding down the Elbe,
with a pilot on board, she came in contact with a galliot, called the
Frau Anna, and sunk her. By this accident, the Paragon lost her
bowsprit, jib-boom, and anchor, and sustained other damage, which
obliged her to put into Cuxhaven, a port at the mouth of the Elbe,
and subject to the jurisdiction of Hamburgh, for repairs. Whilst
lying there, the captain of the galliot libelled the Paragon in the
Marine- Court, alleging that the loss of the vessel was caused by the
carelessness or fault of those on board of the Paragon. The ship
was arrested; but was subsequently released on security being given
by the agents of the owners, to respond to such damages as should
be awarded by the Court. Upon the hearing of the cause, the Court
decided that the collision was not the result of fault or carelessness
on either side, and that therefore, according to the marine law of
Hamburgh, the loss was a general average loss, and to be borne
equally by each party: that is to say, that the Paragon was to bear
one-half of the expense of her own repairs, and to pay one-half of
the value of the galliot; and that the galliot was to bear the loss of
one-half of her own value, and to pay one-half of the repairs of the

108.

SUPREME COURT.

(Peter vs. The Warren Insurance Company.]
Paragon: the result of which was, that the Paragon was to pay
the sum of two thousand six hundred dollars, being one-half of the
value of, the galliot, (three thousand dollqrs,) after deducting onehalf of her own repairs, (four hundred dollars.) The owners of the
Paragon having no funds in Hamburgh, the captain was obliged' to
raise the money on bottomry. There being no cargo on board of
the Paragon, and no freight earned, the Paragon was obliged tot
bear the whole loss.
UpQn this state of facts the question arose, whether in this case
the contributory amount paid by the Paragon on account of the collision, was a direct, positive, and proximate effect from the accident,
in such sense As to render the defendants liable therefor. Upon this
question the judges were opposed in opinion; and it has accordingly
been certified to this Court for a final decision.
That a loss by collision, without any fault on either side, is a loss
by the perils of the sea, within the protection of the policy of insurance, is not doubted. So far as the injury and repairs done to the
Paragon itself extend, it is admitted that the underwriters are liable
for all the damages. The only point is, whether the underwriters
are liable for the contribution actually paid on account of the loss of
the galliot.
This point does not appear ever to have been decided in any of
the, American Courts. It is proper, therefore, t6 examine it upon
principle ; and to ascertain what is the true bearing of the foreign
authorities upon it.
And first upon principle:, That the owrlers of the Paragon have
been compelf d to pay this contribution without any fahlt on their
side, is admitthd ; that it constituted a proper subject of cognisance
by the Marine Court of Hamburgli, the collision having occurred
within the territorial jurisdiction of that city, is also admitted ; and
that the claim constituted a charge or lien upon the Paragon, according to the local law, capable of being enforced by a proceeding in
rem, is equally clear. Why, then, should not the loss be borne by
the underwriters, since it was an unavoidable incident or consequence
resulting from the collision ?
The argument is, that in the law of insurance, which governs the
present contract, it is a settled' rule that underwriters are liable only
for losses arising from the proximate cause of the loss, and not for
losses arising from a remote cause, not immediately connected with
the, peril. Causa proxim,a non remota spectatur. The rule is correct, when it is understood and applied' in its true sense; and, as
such, it has been repeatedly recognised in this Court. But the question, in all cases of this sort, is; what in a ust sens , is the proximate cause of the loss ?
The argument in the present case, on the part of the defendants,
is, that the law of Hamburgh, is the immediate or proximate cause
of the loss now claimed, and the collision is but the remote cause.
But surely this is an over-refinement, and savours more of metaphysical than of legal reasoning. If the argument were to be followed

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

109

[Peters vs. The Warren Insurance Company.]
out, it might be said, with more exactness, that the decree of the

Court was the proximate cause, and the'law of. Hamburgh the remote cause of this loss. But law, as a practical science, does not
indulge in 8uch niceties. It seeks to administer' justice according to
the fair interpretation of the intention of the parties; and deems that
to be a loss within the policy, which is a natural or necessary consequence of the peril insured against. In a just view of the matter,
the collision was the sole proximate cause of the loss; and the decree
of the Court did 'but 'ascertain and fix the amount, chargeable upon
the Paragon, and attached thereto at the very moment of the collision. The contribution was azconsequence of the collision, and not
a cause. It was an incident inseparably connected, in contemplation
of law, with the sinking of the galliot; and a damage immediate.
direct; and positive, from the collision. In the common case of an
action for damages for a tort done by the defendant, no one is accustomed to call tho verdict of the jury, and the judgment of the Court
thereon, the cause of the loss to the defendant. It is' properly attributed to the original tort, which gave the right to damages consequent thereon; which damages the verdict and judgment ascertained;
but did not cause.
But let us see how the doctrine is applied in other analogous cases
of insurance, to which, as much as to the present case, the same
maxim ought to apply, if there is any just foundation for it here. If
there be any commercial contract which, more than any other, requires the application of sound common sense and practical reasoning. in the exposition of it, and in the uniformity of the application
of rules to it, it is certainly a policy of insurance; for it deals with
the business and interests of common men, who are unused to deal
with abstractions and refined distinctions. Take the case of a jettison at sea, to avoid a peril insured, against. It is a voluntary sacrifice, and may be caused by the perils of the sea ; but it isascertained
long afterwards, and that ascertainment, whether made by a Court
of justice, or by an agreement of the parties, would, in the sense of
the maxim contended for in the argument, be the immediate cause
of the contribution, and the jettison but a remote cause ; and the
violence of the winds and waves a still more remote cause of the
jettison. Yet all such niceties are disregarded, and the underwriters
are held liable for the loss thus sustained by the jettison, as a general
average. It is no answver to say, that this is now the admitted doctrine
of the law; and therefore itis treated as a loss within the policy.
The true question to be asked is, why is it so treated? General
average, as such, is not, eo nomine, insured against in our policies.
It is only payable when it is a consequence,. or result, or incident
(call it which we may) of some peril positively insured against; as,
for example, of the perils of the sea. rhe case of a ransom after
capture stands upon similar grounds. The ransom is, in a strict metaphysical sense, no natural consequence of the capture. It may
be agreed upon long afterwards: and if we were to look to the immediate cause, it might be said that the voluntary act of the party
VoL. XIV.-K

(Peters vs. The Warren Insurance Company.]

in the payment was the cause of the loss. But the law treats it
as far otherwise; and deems the ransom a necessary means of
deliverance from a peril insured against, and acting directly upon
the property. The expenses consequent upon a capture, where restitution is decreed by a Court of Admiralty upon the payment of
all the costs andexpenses of the captors, fall under a similar consideration.- In such cases, the decree of the Court allowing the costs
and expenses may be truly said to be the immediate cause of the
loss; but Courts of justice treat it also as the natural consequence
of the capture.
A still more striking illustration-will be found in the case of salvage decreed by a Court of Admiralty for services. rendered to' a
vessel in distress. The vessel may have been long before dismasted
or otherwise injured, or abandoned by her crew in consequence of
the perils of the winds and waves; and the salvage decreed in such
a case, would seem, at the first view, far removed from the original
peril, and disconnected from it: and yet, in the law of insurance, it
is constantly attributed to the original peril, as the direct and proxiRate cause ; and the underwriters are held responsible therefor, although salvage is not specifically, and in terms, insured against.
These are by hie means the only illustrations of the danger of
introducing such an application of. the maxim into 'the law of insurance, as is now contended for. Suppose a perishable cargo is
greatly danaged by the perils of the sea, and it should, in conse-.
quence thereof, long afterwards, and before arrival at the port of
destination, become gradually so putrescent as to be required to be
thrown overboard for the safety of the crew:. the immediate cause
of the loss would be the act of the master and crew; but there is no
doubt that the 'underwriters would be liable for a total loss, upon
the ground that the operative cause was the perils of the sea. Suppose a vessel which'Isinsured against fire only, is struck by lightning,
and takes fire ; and in order to save-her from utter destruction, she
is scuttled and sunk in shoal water, and she cannot afterwards be
raised; it might be said that the immediate cause of the loss was the
scuttling: but in a juridical sense, it would be attributed to the fire;
and the underwiiters would be held liable therefor.- Suppose another case, that of a vessel insured against all perils but fire; and
she is shipwrecked by a storm on a barbarous coast, and is there
burnt by the natives: it might be said that the proximate cause of
the loss was the fire, and yet there is no doubt that the underwriters
would be held liable on the policy, upon the ground that the vessel
had never been delivered from the original peril of shipwreck.,
Illustrations of this sort might be pursued much farther, but it
seems unnecessary. Those which have been already suggested sufficiently establish, that the maxim, causa proxima non remota spectatur,, is not without limitations; and has never been applied in
matter of insurance to the extent contended for: but that it has been
constantly qualified, and constantly applied only in a modified practical sense, to the perils insured against. In truth, in the present

(Peters vs. The Warren Insurance Company.]

case, the loss occasioned by the contribution is (as has been already
suggested) properly a consequence of the collision; and in no just
sense a substantive independent loss.
In the next plea, how stand the authorities on this subject? The
only authority which has been cited by the counsel for the defendants, to sustain their argument, is the case of De Vaux vs. Salvador,
4 Adolphus and Ellis' Rep. 420. That case is certainly direct to
the very point now injudgment. It was a case of collision, where
the assured had been compelled to pay for an injury done to another
vessel by the mutual fault of both vessels, according to. the rule of
the English Court of Admiralty; which, in a case of mutual fault,
apportions the loss between them. Lord Denman, in delivering the
opinion of the Court, admitted that the point was entirely new; and
after referring to the above maxim, said, "It turns out that the ship
(insured) has done more damage than she has received, and is
obliged to pay the owners of the other ship to some amount, under
the rule of the Court of Admiralty. But this is neither a necessary
nor a proximate effect of the perils of the sea. It grows out'of an
arbitrary provision in the law of nations; from views of general
expediency, not as dictated by natural justice, nor (possibly) quite
consistent with it: and can no more be charged on the underwriters
than a penalty incurred by contravention of the revenue laws of
any particular state, which was rendered inevitable by perils insured
against." This is the whole reasoning of the learned judge upon
the point; and with great respect, if the views already suggested
are well founded, it is not supported by the analogies of the law, or
by the' principles generally applied to policies of insurance. The
case of a penalty, put by the learned judge, does not strike us with
does his lordship. if any nation should be so
the same force as it"
regardless of the principles of natural justice, as to declare that a
vessel driven on shore by a storm should be forfeited because its
reirenue laws were thereby violated; it would then deserve consideration whether the underwriters would not be liable for the loss,
as an inevitable incident to the shipwreck. At all events, the point
is too doubtful in itself to justify us in adopting it as the basis of
any reasoning in the present case.
The case before the King's Bench was confessedly new, and does
not appear upon this point to have been much argued at the bar.
It seems to have been decided, principally, upon the ground of the
absence of any authority in ,favour of the assured; and as it appears
to us, in opposition to the analogies furnished by other acknowledged
doctrines in the law of insurance.
The same question, however, has undergone the.deliberate consideration of some of the greatest maritime jurists of continental
Europe; and the result at which they have arrived is directly opposite to that of the King's Bench. Pothier lays it down as, in his
opinion, the clear result of the contract of insurance, that the underwriters are bound to pay not only the direct loss occasioned by any
peril, insured against, but all the expenses which follow as a conse-

quence therefrom. Pothier, Trait6 d'Assurance, n. 49: Estrangin,
a very excellent modern commentator upon Pothier,. (Estrangin's
note,) asserts that there is not the slightest doubt oi the subject.
Emerigon, whose reputation as a writer on the law of insurance is
second to no one, unequivocally adopts the same opinion. Emerig.
As~ur. ch. 12, s. 14, p. 414-417. In short, all those learned foreigners hold the doctrine that whenever the thing insured becomes by law
directly chargeable with any expense, contribution, or loss, in consequence of a particular peril, the law treats that peril, for all practical
purposes, as the proximate cause of such expensej contribution, or
loss. And this they hold, not upon any peculiar provisions of the
French ordinance, but upon the general principles of law applicable
to the contract of insurance. In our opinion this is the just sense
and true interpretation of the contract.
It has been suggested that there is a difference between our policies and the French policies; the latter containing an express enumeration of fortuitous collision, or running foul, (abordage fortuit,)
as a peril insured against; while in our policies it fallsonly under the
more general head of "perils of the sea." But this furnishes no
just ground for any distinction in principle. The reasoning, if any,
to be derived from this circumstance, would seem Kather to apply
with more force in favour of the plaintiff, since, even when the risk
of collision is specifically enumerated, the expenses and contribution
attendant upon it are treated as inseparable from the direct damage
to the vessel itself, as a part of the loss. In short, whether a particular risk is specified in terms, or is comprehended in the general
words of the policy, the same result must arise, viz. that the underwriters are to bear all losses properly attributable to that peril; and
'no other losses.
It may be proper to remark, that the rule which wp here adopt,
is just as likely, iiactual practice, to operate favourably as unfavourably to the underwriters. If by the collision the Paragon had
been sunk, and the galliot saved, the underwriters would have had
the entire benefit of the reciprocity of the rule. It would sound odd
that in such a case the underwriters should be entitled to receive
the full benefit of the Hamburgh law for their own indemnity; and
yet in the opposite ease, that they should escape from the burden
imposed by that law.
in all foreign voyages, the underwriters necessarily have it in
contemplation that the vessel insured must, or at-least may be, subjected to the operation of the laws of the foreign ports which are
visited. Those very laws may in some cases impose burdens, and
in some cases give benefits, different from our laws; and yet there
are cases under policies of insurance, where it is admitted that the
foreign law will govern the rights of the parties, and not the domestic law. Such is the known case ef a general average, settled in a
foreign port according to the local law; although it may differ from
our own. Simonds vs. 'White, 2 Barn. and Cr-sw. 805. In the
presentcase, the policy was on time, and 'ie vessel had, as it were,

a roving commission to visit any foreign port; and of course might
well be presumed at different periods to come under the dominion
of various codes of laws, which might subject her to various expenditures and burdens. The underwriters have no right to complain, that when those expenditures and burdens arise from a peril
insured against, they are compelled to pay them; for they were
bound to have foreseen the ordinary incidents of the voyage. Suppose a vessel injured by the perils of the sea puts into a foreign port
to repair, and the license to repair, or the repairs themselves, are
burdened with a heavy revenue duty; no one will doubt that the
charge must be borne by the underwriters, as an expense incident
to the repair: and yet it might truly be said not to be the natural
result of the peril, bat only a charge imposed by law, donsequent
thereon.
Upon the whole, we are of opinion that it be certified to the Circuit Court, that in this case the contributory amount paid by the
Paragon, on account of the collision, was a direct, positive, and proximate effect from the accident, in such sense as to render the defendants liable therefor upon this policy.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts, and on the point and question on which the judges of the
said Circuit Court were opposed in opinion, and whiich was certified
to this Court for its opinion, agreeably to the act of Congress in such
cases made and provided; and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this Court that, "in this case,
the contributory amount paid by the Paragon, on account of the
collision, was a direct, positive, and proximate effect from the accident, in such sense as to render the defendants liable therefor upon
this policy." Whereupon it is ordered and adjudged by this Court,
that it be so certified to the said Circuit Court.
