SUPREME COURT.

THE UNITED STATES VS. SAMUEL

R. W/oo.D

The defendant was indicted for perjury in falsely taking and swearing "the owner's oath,
in cases where goods have been actually purchased," as prescribed by the fourth section
of the supplementary collection law of the first of March, 1823. The perjury was charged
to have been committed in April, 1837, at the customhouse in New York, on the importation of certain woollen goods in the ship Sheridan. The indictment charged the defendant with having intentionally suppressed the true cost of the goods, ivith intent to defraud
the United States. 2. Charging the perjury in swearing to the truth of the invoice produced by him at the time of entry of the goods, the invoice being false, &c. It appeared
by the evidence that the goods mentioned in the entry had been bought by the defendant
from John Wood, his father, of Saddleworth, England. No 'witness was produced by
the United States to prove that the value or cost of the goods was greater than that for
which they were entered at the customhouse in New York. The evidence of this, offered
by the prosecution, was the invoice book of John Wood, and thirty-five original letters
from the' defendant to John Wood, between 1834 and '1837, showing a combination
between John Wood. and the defendant to defraud the United States, by invoicing and
entering goods at less than their actual cost; that this combination comprehended the
goods imported in the Sheridan; and that the goods received by that ship had been entered
by the defendant, he knowing that they had cost more than the prices at which he *had
entered them. This evidence was objected to on the part of the defendant, as not competent proof to convict the defendant of the crime of perjury; and that, if an inference of
guilt could be derived from such proof, it was an inference from circumstances, not sufficient, as the best legal testimony, to warrant a conviction. Held, That in order to a conviction, it was fiot necessary on the part of the prosecution to produce a living witness;
if the jury should believe from the written testimony that the defendant made a false and
corrupt oath when he entered the goods.
The cases in which a living witness to the corpus delicti of the defendant, in a prosecution
for perjury, may be dispensed with, are: All such where a person charged with a penury
by false swearing to a fact directly disproved by documentary orwritten testimony spring,
ing from himself, with circumstances showiag the corrupt intent: In cases where the
perjury charged is contradicted by a public record, proved to have been well known to
the defendant when he took the oath, the oath only being proved to have been taken:
In cases where the party is charged with taking an oath contrary to what he must necessarily have known to be the truth, and the false swearing can .be proved by his own letters relating to the fact sworn to, or by other written testimony existing and being found
in the possession of the defendant, and which has been treated by him as containing the
evidence of the fact recited in it.
The letters of the defendant, showing his knowledge of the actual cost of the goods which
had been falsely entered by him, are the best evidence which can be given. This evidence is good under the general principle that a man's own acts, conduct, and declarations, when voluntary, are always admissible in evidence against him. If the letters of
the defendant showed that the invoice book of the vendor of the goods; containing an
invoice of the goods enumerated in the invoice to which the defendant had sworn the
owner's oath, in which book the goods were priced higher in the sale of them to the
defendant, recognised the book as containing the true invoice; his admission supersedes
the necessity of other proof to establish the real price given by him for the goods; and the
letters and invoice book, in connection, preponderate against the oath taken by the defendant, making a living witness to the corpus delicti charged in the indictment, unnecessary.
The rule is, that secondary or inferior shall not be substituted for evidence of a higher
nature which the case admits of. The reason of that role is, that an attempt to substitute the inferior for the higher, implies that the. higher would give a diffesent aspect to
the case of the party introducing the lesser. "The ground of the rule is a suspicion of
fraud." But before the rule is applied, the nature of the case must be considered, to
make a right application of it; and if it shall be seen that the tfct to be proved is an act

[The United States vs. Wood.]
of the defendant, which from its nature can be concealed from all others except him
whose cc-operation was necessary before the act could be complete; then the admissions
and declarations of the defendant, either in writing, or to others, in relation to the act,
become evidence.

ON a certificate of division from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Southern District of New York.
The defendant was indicted under the revenue collection laws for
the crime of perjury, alleged in the indictment to have been committed by him, in swearing to the matters required to be stated in
the "owner's oath, in cases where goods, wares, or merchandise have
been actually purchased," prescribed by the fourth section of the act
supplementary to, and to amend, an act ehtitled "An Act to regulate
the Collection of Duties on Imports and Tonnage, passed 2d March,
1799, and for other purposes," approved March 21st, 1823; that
oath having been taken by him on the twentieth day of Apxil, one
thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven, upon the importation of
wiollen goods received by him, in the ship Sheridan, from Liverpool, and entered by him, on the said twentieth day of April, as the
owner thereof, at the customhouse in the city of New York.
The indictment contained two counts; the first relating to the
entry referred to in the oath, and the second to the invoice produced
and exhibited at the time of making the oath, and referred to therein.
In each count there were several assignments of perjury; charging,
in substance, that the actual cost of the goods in question was not
truly stated in the said entry and invoice: that the said goods had,
in fact, and within the knowledge of the defendant, cost more than
the prices stated in the said entry and invoice: and that, in entering
said goods, he had intentionally concealed and suppressed the true
cost thereof, with intent to defraud the United States.
In the progress of the trial, it appeared that the goods in question
had been shipped to the defendant by his father, John Wood, of
Saddleworth, England, in March, 1837; and that in the invoice produced by the defendant at the time of the entry, and referred to in
the oath, the goods in question were represented to have been
bought by the defendant of said John Wood.
It also appeared, that for several years before and for some time
after the importation by the Sheridan, the defendant had been in the
habit of receiving woollen goods from his said father, which were
entered by the defendant at the customhouse, inthe city of New
York, upon the oath of defendant, as owner, and upon the production of invoices representing the goods to have been sold to the
defendant by the said John Wood.
One package out of every invoice of the goods entered by defendant, including the goods in question, had been inspected by the
officers of customs; and all the packages in each invoice had been
admitted at the cost prices stated in the invoices, and the duties on
such cost price duly paid on the same.
It appeared, from the testimony of the inspectors of the customs,

432

SUPREME COURT.
[The United Sthtes vs. Wood.]

that the packages designated for inspection, according to their examination and judgment, were not valued in the invoices beyond
the actual cost of similar goods imported by other persons.
No witnesses were produced on the part of the prosecution to testify to the actual cost of the goods in question, at, the time and place,
when and where they were purchased. Bht the counsel for the
United States, to prove the charge in the indictment, to wit, that the
goods in question actually cost, to the knowledge of the defendant,
more than the prices stated in the invoice, offered and proved certain
documentary evidence, consisting of an invoice book of the above
named John Wood, and of thirty-five original letters from the defendant, Samuel R. Wood, to the said John Wood, written between
April, 1834, and December, 1837; and it was alleged, on the part
of the prosecution, that this proof disclosed a combination between
Samuel R. Wood and John Wood to defraud the United States, by
invoicing and entering the goods shipped at less than their actual
cost; and also disclosed that this combination extended to the shipment by the Sheridan, and that the goods received by that vessel
had cost, as defendant knew when he entered the same, more than
the prices stated in the invoice produced, and in the entry made by
him.
The counsel for the defendant objected to the competency of such
proof to convict of ihe crime stated in the indictment; and insisted
that, even if an inference of guilt could be derived from such proof,
it was an inference from circumstances not sufficient as the best
legal testimony to warrant a conviction.
That the legal testimony required to convict of perjury in this case
was the testimony of at least one living witness, to disprove the truth
of the defendant's oath, as to the actual cost of the goods, at the time
and place of exportation.
That until such proof was adduced, the documentary evidence
produced by the counsel of the United States did not constitute the
legal evidence upon which the defendant could be convicted of the
perjury charged in the indictment.
The question being discussed, the judges were divided in opinion
on the point:
"Whether it was necessary, in order to convict the defendant of
the crime charged in the indictment, to produce, on the part of the
prosecution, at least one living witness, corroborated by another wit
ness, or by circumstances to contradict the oath of the- defendant."
Which point, upon which the disagreement happened, was stated
under the direction of the said Court at the request of the counsel
for the parties in the cause, and was certified into. the Supreme
Court of the United Stktes, pursuant to the act in such case made
and provided.
The case was argued by Mr. Gilpin, Attorney General, for the
United States; and Mr. Maxwell submitted a printed brief and
points, and authorities, for the defendant.

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

433

[The United States vs. Wood.]

Mr. Gilpin, for the United States.
This indictment arises under the fourth section of the act of 1st
March, 1823. 3 Story's Laws, 1882. That section provides for
two clases.of importations, those made by the owner and purchaser resident here, and those coming to a consignee or agent, resident here, the owner being in a foreign country.. When the importation is made by the former, he is required to swear that the entry
and invoice, which he presents at the customhouse, contain a just and
true account of the actual cost; and that the invoice so presented is
the only one which he knows or believes to be in existence. Where
the importation is made by a mere consignee, who,'of course, in
such case, cannot know the actual cost, he is required to swear that
the entry and invoices contain a just and true valuation.
The goods which w ei. the, subject of this controversy, were
goods alleged by the defendaht.t have been actually purchased by
him; and he swore, therefore; that the sum stated by him was their
actual cost, and the invoice produced the true and only invoice
there6f. -What may have been their value is immaterial. It is not
denied that the oath was taken; and therefore, the only question on
the trial was, whether the defendant's statement was true; that is,
was the sum he swoTe to be the true cost, that which he actually
paid; and was the invoice he produced the only invoice which he
knew or believed to exist?
It was alleged, on behalf of the United States, that the statement sworn to was not true in either particular; and to sustain this
allegation, they offered in evidence the original invoice book of the
person in England from whom the defendant made his purchase;
and thirty-five original letters of the defendant to that person; all
going directly tq sustain the truth of the allegation, and to show, by
the correspondence between the parties, that the sum stated was
not the true cost, nor the invoice produced the true and only invoice.
This evidence was objected to as insufficient, solely on the ground
that there was an established rule of law which made it indi'spensable to produce "-at least one living witness, corroborated by
another witness, or by circumstances,." in order to convict the defendant of perjury.
To no branch of legal science, perhaps, have the principles of a
sound philosophy been applied so fully as to evidence; and with
justice, because if truth be the great end of moral conduct, our first
efforts should be to investigate the surest means of attaining it; and
justly too, because every thing of dharacter depends on what the
designated tribunals shall declare to be the truth. Hence no branch
of law rests more on principle than evidence. By it, Courts have
been governed in their decisions, and it is not too much to say, that
if they should find an arbitrary rule existing, which tended to obstruct the development of truth, no antiquity, no precedent, would
induce them to adhere to it.
If, however, there be one rule of evidence more absolute and
controlling than all others-to which all others must yield-it is
VOL. XIV.-2 0

55

.434

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Wood.]

that the best evidene must always be produced; pot one sort or
another indiscriminately-not parol or documentary-but whatever,
in 'the particular case, is the best. Suppose a man to be charged
with stating falsely what he said to another ; the testimony of those
who. heard what he did say would be the best. Suppose him to be
charged with stating falsely what he had written to another; will
it be doubted whether the writing itself, or the testimony of one
who had read it, is the best? An arbitrary rule, which should sustain the latter in preference to the former, could not stand the test
of judicial wisdom for a moment.
In the present case, the defendant has declared on oath, that ie
has stated truly the sum he actually paid, and produced the only
invoice of these goods that he knew of or believed to exist. What
is the best evidence on these points? The seller lives in England ;
the buyer here; they have numerous transactions; their many payments and shipments are blended in a long and general account.
What "living witness" could prove the 'sum paid for these particular goods, or dissect the account to ascertain it ?' If he could,
would his testimony in the eye of reason or the law be the best?
Would it be comparable to the letter-the private letter between
the parties-which states the sum paid ? How could a Court, in
these circumstances, take the imperfect testimony of the " living
witness" under a technical rule, in preference to the incontrovertible
written document; how could it reject what is primary and excellent, for what is secondary and inferior?
But there is no such rule'; none stich is sustained by any authority cited. The cases referred to establish a sound and just prin-.
cipl ; that the oath of the defendant must be contradicted by a preponderance of testimony; that one oath against another is insufficient; that there-must be evidence more than equivalent to, a single
oath. To this extent the general expression used in the cases cited,
'that "two witnesses are necessary to convict of perjury," was
meant to apply. Such facts being usually proved by parol evidence,
that charging a person with guilt ought clearly to preponderate.
Nence it was said, there must be one oath to balance, and a second
to outweigh that of the defendant. But it was early decided, that
the outweighing evidence might''be made up of circumstances; that
admissions in letters, and other written testimony were as good as
a setond oath. This is admitted in the present case. Does not. this
yield the whole principle? Does it not admit that the rule is not
oath against oath: if the written testimony is better than that 6ffered
under the-oath ? In treason, two witnesses to an- overt act are required; yet written declarations of the defendant himself are held
to be stronger than the parol statement of a witness. 2 Starkie's
Cases, 123, 125. Suppose a defendant in Chancery affirms a fact
in direct response to the bill-a case in which the same technical
rule exists as in that of perjury-would it be tolerated that he
should have the benefit of it, thoumgh two, or ten, or fifty of his own
letters directly contradict him ? The voluntary confessions and

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

435

[The United States vs. Wood.]

admissions of a party are regarded as the best possible evidence; is
it conceivable that in a case of perjury they would, if made in
writing, be totally rejected, no matter how clear, repeated, and distinct, unless some "living witness" could be fbund to prove what
is thus voluntarily acknowledged ? Suppose this defendant, in art
affidavit before some competent tribunal, had stated the actual cost
of the goods now in controversy to be twice as much as he has
here sworn to; could higher or more satisfactory proof of falsehood be adduced ? Yet to such difficulties should we be, brought,
if we were to set aside the paramount rule, which requires and
admits in all cases, the best evidence ; and acknowledge in those of
perjury an arbitrary one, evidently applicable to particular instances
alone.
But to whatever extent the technical rule may have been formerly
sustained, it is certainly at variance with later authorities. In the
King vs. Dane, (5 Barn. and Aid. 941,) it was held, that a defendant may be convicted of perjury, without any other proof than a
contrary deposition of his own; for it was said, when he has asserted
and denied the same fact by opposite oaths, the one seems sufficient
to disprove the other. So in the King vs. Knill, (5 Barn. and Ald.
939,) there was no evidence to sustain the prosecution, except proof
of contradictory oaths of the defendant on two occasions; and,
though it was insisted that mere proof of a contradictory statement
on another occasion was insufficient, without the confirmation of a
second witness, yet the Court held it to be.enough, because the contradiction was by the party himself. In the case of the King vs.
Mayhew, (6 Carr. and Payne, 315,) a letter of the defendant's was
held to be good evidence against him; though in that, case there
was, besides, the oath of a "living witness." These cases establish
the point, that the rule is not an arbitrary and unbending one, setting aside the paramount principle which requires the best evidence;
but a rule, to be applied merely in those cases where the evidence
is equally balanced, not derived from the acts or admissions of the
party itself, and depending exclusively on parol testimony.
On these grounds it is submitted, that the evidence derived from
the defendant's letters and invoice books, was sufficient to warrant
his conviction ; if they were believed by the jury to establish the
facts which they were produced to prove.

Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court.
This cause has been sent to this Court, upon a certificate ot division of opinion between the judges of the Circuit Court for the
Southern District of New York.
The defendant was indicted for perjury, in falsely taking and
swearing to the " owners' oath, in cases where goods have been
actually purchased;" as prescribed by the fburth section of the supplementary collection, law of the 1st March, 1823. 3 Story's Laws,
1883.
The indictment charged the perjury to have been committed on
20th April, 1837, at the customhouse, in New York, on the importation of certain woollen goods, in the ship Sheridan, from Liverpool,
shipped to the defendant by John Wood, of Saddleworth, England.
There were two counts in the indictment. The first count charged
the perjury in swearing to the truth of the entry of the goods, and
averred that the actual cost of the goods was not truly stated in the
entry ; that it was known to the defendant that they cost more than
was there stated, and that on entering them, he intentionally suppressed the true cost, with intent to defraud the United States. The
second count charged the perjury in swearing to the truth of the
invoice produced by the defendant at the time of the entry; and
contained similar averments as to its falsity and the intention of the
defendant.
In the progress of the trial, it appeared in evidence that the goods
in question had been shipped to the defendant by his father, John
Wood, of Saddleworth, England, in March, 1837; and that in the
invoice produced by the defendant at the time of entry, and referred
to in the oath, the goods in question were represented to have been.
bought by the defendant of said John Wood.
It also appeared, that fer several years before, and for some time
after the importation by th. Sheridan, the defendant had been in
the habit of receiving woollei, goods from his father, which were

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

437

[The United States vs, Wood.]

entered in the customhouse in the city of New York, upon the oath
of the defendant, as owner, and upon the production of invoices
representing the goods to have been sold to the defendant by the
said John Wood.
It appeared from the testimony of the inspedtors of the customs,
that the packages designated for inspection, according to their examination and judgment, were not valued in the invoices beyond the
actual value of similar goods imported by other persons.
No witnesses were produced on the part of the prosecution, to testify to the actual costof the goods in question, at the time and place
when and where they were purchased. But the counsel for the
United States, to prove the charge in the indictment, to wit, that the
goods in question actually cost, to -the knowledge of the defendant,
more than the prices stated in the invoice, offered and proved an
invoice book of John Wood, and thirty-five original letters from the
defendant, Samuel R. Wood, to the said John Wood, written between April, 1834, and December,. 1837; and, it was alleged on
the part of the prosecution, that this proof disclosed a combination
between Samuel R. Wood. and John Wood, to defraud the United
States, by invoicing and entering goods, shipped at less than taeir
actual cost; and also disclosed that this combination extended to the
shipment by the Sheridan; and that the goods received by that vessel
had cost, as defendant knew, when he entered the same,'more than
the prices stated in the invoice produced, arid in the entry made by
him.
The counsel for the defendant objected to the competency of such
proof to convict of the crime stated in the indictment; and insisted
that even itan inference of guilt could be derived from such proof,.
it was an inference from circumstances not sufficient, as the best
legal testimony, to warrant a conviction.
That the legal testimony required to convict of perjury in this
case, was the testimony of at least one living witness to disprove
the truth of the defeldant's oath as to the actual cost of the goods,
at the time and place of exportation.
That until such proof was adduced, the documentary evidence
produced by the counsel of the United States did not constitute the
legal evidence upon which the defendant could be convicted of the
perjury, charged in the indictment.
,The judges were divided in opinion, " whether it was necessary,
in order to convict the defendant of the crime charged in the indictment, to produce, on the part of the prosecution, at least one living
witness, corroborated by another witness, or .bycircumstances, to
contradict the'oath of the defendant."
The rule upon which the defendant's counsel relies will be found
in most of the elementary writ~rs-and digests of the law, very much
in the same words. Blackstone in his Commentaries, vol. iv. p. 256,
says. "The doctrine of evidence upon pleas of the crown, is in most
respects the same as that upon civil actions. There are, however,
a few leading points, wherein, by several statutes and resolutions, a
202

438

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Wood.]

difference is made between civil and criminal cases."

Then pro

ceeding to state the differences made by some of the statutes in cases
of treason, followed by a general remark or two; he observes, "but
in almost every other accusation, one positive witness is sufficient :"
and afterwards, contesting the general accuracy of Baron Montesquieu's reflection upon laws being fatal to liberty, which condemn
a man to death in any cash upon the deposition of a single witness;
he adds, "In cases of indictment for perjury, this doctrine is better
founded, and there our law adopts it, for one witness is not allowed
to convict a man indicted for perjury, because then there is only one
oath against another."
In Viner, 16, Let. K. 328, "Presumption is ever to be made in
favour of inr ocence ; and the oath of the party will have regard
paid to it tilr disproved. Therefore, to convict a man of perjury
probable or credible evidence, is not enough; but it must be a strong
and clear evidence, and more numerous than the evidence given for
the defendant, for else it is only oath against oath. A mistake is not
enough to convict a man of perjury; the oath must not only be false,
but wilful and malicious."
10 Mod. 193.
In Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, vol. ii. ch. 46, p. 591, ",On an
indictment for perjury, the evidence of one witness is not sufficient,
because then there would only be one oath against another." Citing
10 Mod. 193, "1To convict a man of perjury, there must be strong
and clear evidence, and more numerous than the evidence given-for
the defendant."-" It does not appear to be laid down, that two
witnessesare necessary to disprove the facts sworn to by the defendant; nor does that seem to be absolutely requisite. Bat at least
one witness is not sufficient, and, in addition to his testimony, some
other independent evidence ought to be adduced."
In Archbold's Criminal Pleading, 157, it is said, upon an indictment for perjury there must be two witnesses; one alone is hot sufficient, because there is in that case only one oath against another.
10 Mod. 193. But if the assignment of perjury be directly proved
by one witness, and strong circumstantial evidence be given by
another, or be established by written documents, this would perhaps be sufficient; although itdoes not appear as yet to have been
so decided. Regina vs. Lea, M. and S. 2 Russel, 545. Also, if the
perjury consist in the defendant having sworn contrary to what he
had before sworn upon the same subject, this is not within the
rule mentioned; for 'the effect of the defendant's oath in the one
case is neutralized by his oath in the other; and proof by one witness will therefore make the evidence preponderate. In 7 Dane's
Abridgment, 82, citing Blackstone, it is said, "It has been decided,
that one witness is not allowed to convict a man indicted for perjury, because there is only oath against oath."-" On a trial for perjury, the oath will be taken as true, until it can be disproved; and
therefore the evidence must be strong, clear, and more numerous, on
the part of the prosecution than that on the defendant's part ; for
the law will not permit a man to be convicted of perjury, unless

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

439

[The United States vs. Wood.]

there are two witnesses at least."
Rep. 419.

For which is cited 1 Bro. Ch.

Crown C. C. 625, 626.

In the second volume of.Starkie's Law of Evidence it is said, "It
is a general rule, that the testimony of a single witness is insufficient
to warrant a conviction on a charge of perjury. This is an arbitrary,
and peremptory rule, founded upon the general apprehension that it
would be unsafe to convict in a case where thee is merely the oath
of one man to be weighed against that of another. Nevertheless,
it very frequently happens, in particular cases, that the testimony
of a single witness preponderates against the limited testimony of
many." In part iii. 399, the same writer says, "So in the case of
perjury, two witnesses are essential; for otherwise there would be
nothing more than the oath of one man against that of another, upon
which the jury could not safely convict."'

In Russel on Crimes and Misdemeanours, 544, it is said, "the evidence of one witness is not sufficient to convict the defendant on an
indictment for perjury, as in such case there would be only one oath
against another." 10 Mod. 393. But Russel gives several exceptions to the application of the rule, resting upon principles clearly
covering the conclusion to which the Court has come upon the
question before it.
In Phillips' Evidence, the rule is also given as it is laid down in
other writers; and the case in 10 Mod. 193, is referred to. It
may be found, too, repeated in many of the volumes of the English
and American reports, as well as in the case of the State vs. Hayward, 1 Nott and M(Cord's Reports, cited by the defendant's
counsel. The cases collected in 13 Petersdorff's Com. Law, affirm
the same rule. It must be conceded, no case has yet occurred
in otpr own, or in the English Courts where a conviction for perjury has been had without a witness speaking to the corpus delicti
of the defendant, except in a case of contradictory oaths by the same
person. But it is exactly in the principle of the exception, which
is by every one admitted to b6 sound law; that this Court has found
its way to the conclusion that cases may occur when the evidence
comes so directly from the defendant that the perjury may be proved
without the aid of a living witness.
These citations have been made with the view of placing the
position contended for by the defendant's counsel in its most positive form; and to show that the conclusion to which the Court has
come, has not been without a due consideratioa] of the rule.
It is said to be an inflexible rule of the common law, applicable to
every charge of perjury; that it cannot be changed but by the legislative power: that until some statutory change is made, Courts must
enforce it: that though other kind of evidence, and that relied upon
by the prosecution in this case, may establish a case of false swearing, it will not suffice to convict for perjury: in short, that a living
witness is in every case indispensible.
We do not think any change in the rule nqcessary. The question

440

[The United States vs. Wpod.]

technical interpretation, or positive undeviating adherence to words,
exclude all other testimony as strong and conclusive as that which
the rule requires. "It is a right rule, founded upon that principle of
natural justice which will not permit one of two persons, both
speaking under the sanction of an oath, and, presumptively, entitled
to the same credit, to convict the other of false swearing, particularly when punishment i§ to follow.
But in what cases is the rule to be applied? To all, where to
prove the perjury assigned, oral testimony is exclusively relied upon?
Then oath against oath proves nothing, except that one of the
parties has sworn falsely as to the fact to which they have sworn
differently. There must then be two witnesses, or one witness corroborated by circumstances, proved by independent testimony. If
we will but recognise the principle upon which circumstances in the
case of one witness are allowed to have any weight, that principle
will carry us out to the con'clusion,, that circumstances, without any
witness, when they exist in documentary or written testimony, may
combine to establish the charge of perjury; as they may combine,
altogether unaided by oral proof, except the proof of their authenticity, to prove any other fact connected with the declarations of
persons or business of human life.
That principle is, that circumstances necessarily make up a part
of the proofs of human transactions; that such as have been reduced
to writing in unequivocal terms, when.the writing has been proved
to be authentic, cannot be made more certain by evidence aliunde;
and that such as have been reduced to writing, whether they relate
to the declarations or conduct of men, can only be proved by oral
testimony.
If it be true, then-and it is so-that the rule of a single witness,
being insufficient to prove perjury rests upon the law of a presumptive equality of credit between persons, or upon what Starkie terms,
the apprehension that it would be unsafe to convict in a case where
there is mer31y the .oath of one man to be weighed against that' of
another; satisfy the equal claim to belief, or remove the apprehension by concurring written proofs, which existed, and are proved to
have been in the knowledge of the person charged with the perjury
when it was committed, especially. if such written proofs came from.
himself, and are facts which he must have known, because they
were his own acts; and the reason for the rule ceases. It can only
then, be an arbitrary, and peremptory rule; as Starkie says it is,
when it is ap,1ie'd
to cases in which oral testimony is exclusively
relied upon to prove perjury.
And such, we will perceive to have been the apprehension of this
rule; and if we wili scrutinize its chronology, we cannot fail tosee
how truth has grown as cases have occurred for its application.
At first two witnesses were required to convict in a case of perjury; both swearing directly adversely from the defendant's oath.
Contemporaneously with this requisition, the larger number of witnesses on one side or the other prevailed. Then, a single witness

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

441

(The United States vs. Wood.]

corroborated by other witnesses, swearing to circumstances bearing
directly upon the imputed corpus delicti of a defendant, was
deemed sufficient. Next, as in the case of Rex vs. Knill, 5 B. and
A. 929, note; with a long interval between it and the preceding; a
witness who gave proof only of the contradictory oaths of the defendant on two occasions, one being an examination before the
House of Lords, and the other an examination before the House of
Commons, was held to be sufficient. Though this principle has
been acted on as early as 1764, by Justice Yates, as may be seen
in the note to the case of the King vs. Harris, 5 B. and A. 937, and
was acquiesced in by Lord Mansfield, and Justices Wilmot and
Aston. We are aware that in a note fo Rex vs. Mayhew, 6 Carrington and Payne, 315, a doubt is implied coficerning the case decided by Justice Yates; but it has the stamp of authenticity, from
its having been referred to in a case happening en years afterwards,
before Justice Chambre, as will appear by the note in 6 B. and A.
937. Afterwards, a single witness, with the defendant's bill of costs
(not sworn to) in lieu of a second witness, deliv.ered by the defendant to the prosecutor, was held sufficient to contradict his oath; and
in that case, Lord Denman says, " a letter Written by the defendant,
contradicting his statement on oath, would be sufficient to make it
unnecessary to have a second witness." 6 Carr. and Payne, 315.
All of the foregoing modifications of the rule, will be found in 2 Russell, 544, and that respecting.written documents is stated in Archbold, 157, in anticipation of the case in Carr. and Payne, 315.
We thus see that this rule in its proper application, has been expanded beyond its literal terms, as cases have occurred in which
proofs have been offered equivalent to the end Intended to be accomplished by the rule.
In what cases, then, will the rule not apply? Or in what cases
may a living witness to the. corpus delicti oT a defendant, be dispensed with, and documentary or written testinony be relied
upon to convict ? We answer, to all such where a person is charged
with a perjury, directly disproved by documentary or written testimony springing from himself, with circunstances showing the corrupt intent. In cases where the perjury charged is contradicted by
a public record, proved to have been well-known to the defendant
when he took the oath; the oath only being proved to have been
taken. In cases where a party is charged with taking an oath, con-trary to what he must necessarily have known to be the truth, 4nd
the false swearing can be proved by his own letters, relating to the
fact sworn to; or by other Written testimony existing and being
found in the possession of a defendant, and which has been treated
by him as containing the evidence of the fact recited in it.
I Let us suppose a case or two, in illustration of the positions just
laid down.
A defendant in two answers to a bill in equity, swears unequivocally to a fact, and as positively against it. A document is produced executed by himself, decisive of the truth of the fact. In
56

442

SUPREME COURT.
[The United Sttes vs. Wood.]

such a case can a living witness be wanted; or could any number of
living witnesses prove, more certainly, the false swearing than it
would be proved by the document and the defendant's contradictory
oaths ? Or, take the case of defendant being sued in equity, to recover from him the contents of a lost bond. In answer to a call upon
him to say whether he had or had not made such a bond, he swears
that he never had made such a bond. The bond is afterwards
found and proved; is not his answer, then, upon oath, disproved by
a circumstance, stronger than words can be, coming from the mouth
of man ?
Again, suppose a person, in order to obtain a right under a statute,
is required to take an oath to a fact which is the mutual act of himself and another, and which from its nature is unequivocal. He
swears contrary to the fact. Subsequently his letters written before
and after his oath are found ; which disclose not only the real fact,
but a general design to misrepresent facts of the same kind, and a
book or other written paper is produced, bearing directly upon
the fact, from its being the original of the transaction reduced
to writing contemporaneously with its occurrence, ard recognised
by the defendant to be such, though it is in the handwriting of
another; will not the defendant's recognition of it, with the auxiliary evidence of the letters,' without a living witness to speak
directly to, the corpus delicti of the defendant, justify the whole
being put before a jury, in a case of perjury; for them to decide
whether the defendant has s worn falsely and corruptly ? In such
a case, if the person was called in whose handwriting the book
or other written paper was, it might happen that he had only
been the recorder of the transaction at the instigation of one of
the parties to it, without his ever having had any communication
with the other respecting its contents. The witness then would
only prove so much, without proving any thing which bore upon
the charge of false swearing. But when the defendant himself.has
recognised the book or writing as evidence of his act-and such
recognition is proved-there is no rule of evidence which requires
other proof, beyond his admission, to prove the contents of the
book or paper to be true. But suppose the book or written paper
to be also in the hafidwriting of the defendant, and that several of
his letters confirm the fact, that he has sworn contrary to the contents of the first-as all the evidence comes from himself-we cannot doubt it would be right to place the whole before a jury, for it
to judge what was the truth of the fact, and whether the defendant
had sworn falsely and corruptly.
We will now proceed to examine the case before us, io see if it
fall within the principles and illustrations we have given.'
The defendant is indicted under the act of Congress of 1st March,
1823, 3 Story, 1883, for falsely and corruptly taking the owners'
oath in cases where goods have been actually purchased. It must
be kept in mind, that this oath can only be taken in cases of goods
imported from foreign countries. It places the importer, then, in a

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

443

[The United States vs. Wood.]

condition to commit fraud in the misrepresentation of the price he
has given for goods; with only an accidental possibility on the part
of the United States, ever being able to detect it by~the evidence
of the person from whom the importer has made the purchase.
The importer is required to swear that the invoice produced by
him, contains a just and faithful account of the actual cost of the
goods; and that he has not in the invoice concdaled or suppressed
any thing, whereby the United States may be defrauded of any part
of the duties lawfully due on the goods, &c. The oath does not require from the owner the value of the goods, but the cost to him.
There is nothing in it relating zo the quality of the goods, but simply the cost or price paid by the importer, as owner. The defendant
in his entry did it upon an invoice sworn to by him, to contain a
just and faithful account of the actual cost; that there was nothing
in it concealed or suppressed.
ie is charged with having sworn falsely in respect to the cost
of the goods contained in the invoice, by which he made his entry
of them. To maintain the charge, the United States must prove
that he paid a larger price. The best evidence, it is admitted, must
be introduced to establish that fact. What is the best evidence in
respect to its quality, as distinguished from quantity or measure; it
being in the former sense that the best evidence is required ? It is,
that secondary or inferior evidence shall not be substituted for evidence of a higher nature, which the case admits of. The reason of
the rule is, that an attempt to substitute the infirior for ihe higher,
implies that the higher would give a different aspect to the case of
the party introducing the lesser. 1 Russel, 437. " The ground of
the rule is a suspicion of fraud." But before the rule is applied,
the nature of the case must be considered, to make a right application of it; and if it shall be seen that the fact to be proved is an act
of the defendant, which, from its nature, can be concealed from all
others except him whose co-operation was necessary before the act
could be complete, then the admissions and declarations by the defendant, either in writing or to others, in relation to the act, become
evidence. It is no longer a question of the quality but of the quantity of evidence, when it is said, as it is in this case, that his associate
in the transaction should be introduced. For instance: we will
suppose that the letters of the defendant in this case speak of the
cost of the goods in the invoice, to which the defendant swore, and
that they show the goods did cost more than they are rated at in the
invoice ; the quality of the evidence is of that character that it cannot be inferred that superior evidence exists, to make that fact uncertain. Unless such inference can be made, the evidence offered
is the best evidence which the nature of the case admits. The evidence is good under the general principle that a man's own acts,
conduct, and declarations, where voluntary, are always admissible
in evidence against him.
So in respect to the invoice book of John Wood, containing an
invoice of the goods enumerated in the invoice to which the defend

444.

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Wood.]

ant swore the owners' oath; in the first of which the goods are
priced higher in the sale of them to the defendant. If the letters
show the book to have been recognised by the defendant as containing the true invoice, his' admission supersedes the necessity of other
proof to establish the real price given by him for the goods; and the
letters and invoice book, in connection, preponderate against the
oath'taken by the defendant, making a living witness to the corpus
delicti, charged in the indictment, unnecessary. All has been done
in the case that can be done to intercept such evidence as would tend
to prejudice'or mislead ; and the case must then be confided to the
good sense and integrity of the jury to determine upon the sufficiency
of" the evidence to convict : the Court charging the jury, that the
evidence offered is of that character which supersedes the necessity
of introdtcing a living witness to prove the perjury charged in the
indictment.
Let it then, be certified to the Court below, as the opinion of this
Court, that in order to convict the defendant of the crime charged
in the indictment, it is not necessary on the part of the prosecution
to produce a living witness ; if the jury shall believe the evidence
from the written testimony sufficient to establish the charge that the
defendant made a false and corrupt oath as to the cost of the goods
imported in the Sheridan, enumerated in the invoice, upon which
the defendant made an entry, by taking the owners' oath at the
customhouse.
Mr. Justice TrioMPsON, dissenting.

The question certified in the record is, whether it was necessary,

in order to convict the defendant of perjury, to produce, on the part

of the prosecution, at least one living witness, corroborated by another witness, or by circumstances, to contradict the oath of the defendant.
The rule, as we find it laid down in the elementary books on this
subject, is, that to convict a party of the crime of perjury, two writnesses are necessary to contradict him as to the fact upon which the
perjury is assigned : and the reason assigned for the rule is, that if
one witness only is produced, there will only be one oath against
another. This rule, however, in the early adjudged cases, was so
modified as to require but one living witness, corroborated by circumstances, to contradict the oath of the defendant; and with this
modification the rule has remained- until the present day.
In the present case, the fact on which the perjury was assigned
related to the actual cost of the goods, at the time and place of exportation. This was a simple question of fact, susceptible of proof
by witnesses, like any other matter of fact. There was nothing,
therefore, growing out Of the nature of the inquiry, that rendered
*the proof by vitnesses impossible, so as to take the case out of the
rules of evidence, in relation to the crime of perjury. No living
witness was produced to contradict the oath of the defendant at the
customhouse, as to the original cost of the goods. His letters and

[The United States vs. Wood.]

certain invoice books were produced to sustain the indictment; and
these might have been sufficient to warrant the juryin convicting
the defendant, if such evidence is sufficient to convict a party of ihe
crime of perjury, without the production of at least one living Nvit'ness. It is, as has been already mentioned, laid down in the books
as a technical rule in perjury, that there must be at least one witness and corroborating circumstances to convict of this crimo : that
there must be oath against oath, as to the corpus delicti.
When the books speak of a witness, they always napap oral testimony. It would hardly be considered as correct legal language, to
call a letter of the defendant a witness against him. It was evidence, but not evidence' by, a witness. The rule, as originally laid
down in the elementary treatises on evidence, requiring two wit-nesses to contradict the party 6i Hd mattertatsigned as perjury, was
so modified or relaxed as not to require two witnesses to disprove
the facts sworn to by the defendant. But i any material circumstances are proved by other witnesses, in confirmation of the witness
who gives the direct testimony of perjury, it may turn the scale, and
warrant a conviction. And in England one case occurred, as re-ported in a note in the seventh volume of the English Common Law
Reports, page 306, where the evidence consisted of the contradictory
oaths of the party accused, upon the same matter of fact in which
the perjury was assigned.: It was held, that in such case there was
oath against oath, and the perjury might be assigned upon either;
and that it might be left to the jury to judge of the motive. The
authority of this case, however, has been very much doubted., Bdt
the present case does not come within that rule, even if we are
disposed to follow the English Courts on that subject; for the letters of the defendant cannot certainly be said to be evidence under
oath, so as to charge him with contradictory oaths on the fact
assigned as perjury. Rules of evidence are rules of law, applicable
to the rights of persons as well as 'to the rights of property; and
parties are entitled to have their rights tested and decided by such
rules, as much in one case as the other. This rule, however, in
perjury, bein'g a technical rule, may in many cases be difficult
if not impracticable to be carried into execution. If it falls within
the proper province of theitourt entirely to dispense with the rule,
and plmt the evidence in pei'jury upon the same footing as other criinitial offences, I should not be disposed to dissent from it; if, as a
new rule, it was made to operate prospectively. But if it is intended
to affirin the doctrine urged at the bar, that no such rule of evidence
ever existed, as to require in ihe case of perjury at least one living
witness, and circumstances in corroboration of his oath, in contradiction to the party charged upon the matter assigned as the perjury ; it would, in my judgment, be at variance with a rule universally laid down in all the elementary treatises on the subject of evidence; and as yet never dispensed with, or ever called in question in
any adjudication that has fallen under my notice. And that this
rule still exists in the English Courts, is shown by the late case of
VoL. XIV 2 P

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Wood.]

Rex vs. Mayhew, 6 Carr. and Payne, 315; decided in the year 1834.
The perjury in that case was alleged to have been committed by
the defendant ( vho was an attorney) in an affidavit made by him,
to oppose a motion made in the Court of Chancery on behalf of the
prosecutor, to refer the defendant's bills of costs for taxation. To
prove the perjury, one witness was called: and in lieu of a second
witness, it was proposed to put in the defendant's bill of costs, delivered by him to the prosecutor. It was objected that this was not
sufficient, as the bills had not been delivered by the defendant on
oath. But Denman, Chief Justice, said, "I have quite made up my
mind that the bill delivered by the defendant is sufficient evidence,
or that even a letter written by the defendant, contradicting his
statement on oath, would be sufficient to make it unnecessary to
have a second witness."
There was no intimation here, that a letter, or any number of letters, from the defendant, contradicting his statement under oath,
would dispense with the technical rule in perjury, requiring at least
one witness, and corroborating circumstances. The question was,
as to what circumstances or evidence would dispense with a second
witness.
In the present case, it may be difficult and perhaps impracticable
to procure any living witness to contradict the oath of the defendant. But it is more congenial with the humane principles of our
criminal law, that a guilty man should escape, than to convict him
upon evidence heretofore considered as insufficient, according to
what is admitted to have been the settled rule of law. Answering
the question put in the record in the negative, is abolishing that
rule and introducing one entirely new; and putting the crime of
perjury on the same footing as any other criminal offence, with
respect to the evidence necessary to convict the accused. If there
are any great public considerations calling for such an innovation
upon the rule of evidence in cases like the present, let it be altered
by the proper tribunal, and under the general rules of evidence
applicable to other criminal cases. The evidence derived from the
letters of the defendant, is perhaps the best evidence the nature of
the case will admit of. But it is an entire misapplication of this
general rule to the present case, if there is a special and technical
rule in the case of perjury that there must be at least one living witness, and corroborating circumstances, to convict of that crime. I
do not feel myself authorized to dispense with what I understand to
be admitted, the heretofore settled rule of evidence, which I consider
a rule of law, in the case of perjury; and to apply this new rule to
the present case by giving it a retrospective operation.
I am accordingly of opinion, that the question put in the record,
ought to be answered in the affirmative.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District
of New York, and on the point and question on which the judges
of the said Circuit Court were opposed in opinion, and which was
certified to this court for its opinion, agreeably to the act of Congress
in such cases made and provided, and was argued by counsel. On
consideration whereof, it is the opiniori of this Cqurt, that in order
to convict the defendant of the crime charged in the indictment, it is
not necessary on the part of the prosecution, to produce a living witness, if the jury shall beleve the evidence from the written testimony sufficient to establish the charge, that the defendant made a
false and corrupt oath, as to the cost of the goods imported in the
Sheridan, enumerated in the invoice upon which the defendant
made an entry by taking the owners' oath at the customhouse.
Whereupon it is ordered and adjudged by this Court, that it be so
certified to the said Circuit Court, accordingly.
