WILLIAM AND JAMEs BROWN AND COMPANY, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR,

vs. THOMAS M'GRAN; DEFENDANT IN ERROR.
An action was instituted against the consignees of two hundred bales of cotton, shipped by
the direction of the owner to Liverpool, on which the owner had received qn advance by,
an acceptance of his bills on New York; which acceptance was paid out by bills draw
on the consignees of thoecotton in Liverpool. Some time after the shipment of the cot
ton, the owner wrote to the consignees in Liverpool, expressing his "wishes", that the
cotton should not be sold until they should hear further from him. In answer to this
letter, the consignees say, "Your wishes in respect to the cotton are noted accordingly.
No other provision than from the sale of the cotton for the payment of the advance, was
made by the consignor, when the same was shipped; and no instructions for its reservation from sale were given, when the shipment was made. Immediately after the acceptance of the bill drawn against the cotton, on the consignees in Liverpool, they sold the
same for a profit of about ten per cent. on the shipment. Cotton rose in price in Liverpool to more than fifty per cent. profit on the invoice, between the acceptance of the bill
of exchange, and the arrival of the same at maturity. The shipper instituted an action
against the consignees for the recovery of the difference between the actual sales and the
sum the same would have brought had it been sold at the subsequent high prices at
Liverpool.
It is certainly true, as a general rule, that-the interpretation of written instruments properly
belongs to the Court, and not to the jury. But there certainly are cases in which, from
the different senses of the words used, or their obscure and indeterminate reference to
unexplained circumstances, the true interpretation of the language may be left to the consideration of the jury, for the purpose of carrying into effect the real intention of the
parties. This is especially applicable to cases of commercial correspondence, where the
real objects, and intentions, and agreements of the partied are often to be arrived at only
by allusions to circumstances which are but imperfectly developed.
There can be no reasonable doubt that in particular circumstances, a wish expressed by a
consignor to a factor, may amount to'a positive command.
In the case of a simple consignment of goods, without any interest in the consignee, or any
advance or liability incurred on account thereof, the wishes of the consignor may fairly
be presumed to be orders; and the "noting the wishes accordingly," by the consignees, an
assent to follow them. But very different considerations might apply where the consignee Ahould be one clothed with a special interest, and a special property, founded upon
advances and liabilities,
Whenever a consignment is made to a factor for sale, the consignor has a right, generally,
to control the sale thereof according to his own pleasure, from time to time, if no advances
have been made, or liabilities incurred, on account thereof; and the factor is bound to
obey his orders. This arises from the ordinary relation of principal and agent. If, however, the factormakes advances, or incurs liabilities on account of the consignment, by
which he acquires a special property in the goods, then the factor has a right to sell so
much of the consignment as may be necessary to reimburse such advances, ormeet such
liabilities; unles there is some agreement between himself and the consignor which contracts or varies this right.
If, cotemporaneous with the consignment and advances or liabilities, there are orders given by
the consignor, which are adsented to by the factor, that the goods shall not be sold before
a fixed time, in such a case the consignment is presumed to be received subject to such
order; and the factor is not at liberty to sell the goods to reimburse his advances, until
after that time has elapsed. So when orders are given not to sell below a fixed price;
unless the consignor shall, after due notice and request, refuse to provide other means to
reimburse the factor. In no case will the factor be at liberty to sell the consignment, contraryto the orders of the consignor, although he has made advances or incurred liabilities
thereon ; ifthe consignor stands ready and offers to reimburse and discharge such advances
and liabiilties.
When the consignment is made generally, without any -pedific orders as to the time and
mode of sales, and the factor makes advances or incurs liabilities on the footing of such

480

SUPREME COURT.
[Brown and Cormpany v8. M'Gran.]

consignment, the legal presumption is, that the factor is intended to be clothed with the
ordinary rights of factors, to sell, in the exercise of a sound discretion, at such time and
in such manner as the usage of trade and his general duty require, and to reimburse
himself for his liabilities, out of the proceeds of the sale: and the consignoi has no right,
by any subsequent orders, given after advances have been made, or liabilities incurred by
the factor, to suspend or control this right of sale, except so far as respects the surplus
of the consignment not necessary for the reimbursement of such advances or liabilities.
If a sale of cotton in Liverpool, by a factor, has been made on a particular day, tortiously,
and against the orders of the owner, the owner has a right to claim damages for the value

of the cotton on the day the sale was made, as for a tortious conversion. If the sale of
the cotton by the factor was authorized on a subsequent day, and the cotton had been
sold against orders, before that day, the damages to which the owner would be entitled
would be regulated by the price of cotton on that day. Pat the rate of damages should

not be obtained from the prices of cotton at any time between the day when the cotton
was sold, against the orders of the owner, and the day 'on which the sale was authorized
by him.

IN error to the Circuit Court of the United States, for the District
of Georgia.
In the Inferior Court of Richmond county, in the state of
Georgia, Thomas M'Gran, the defendant, instituted a suit by attachment against the plaintiffs in error, to recover damages for the
sale of two hundred bales of cotton, shipped by him to the plaintiffs in error, as his factors; the cotton having been sold for a less
price than the same would have produced had the sales been made
according to the instructions of the shipper.
The declaration contained three counts, all upon the shipment of
the two hundred bales of cotton, by Thomas M'Gran to William
and James Brown and Company, at Liverpool; as the factors of the
shipper.
The first count alleges, that while the cotton remained in the
hands of the consignees, the shipper ordered him to hold the cotton
until they should hear from him againi; but the same was sold in
violation of the order, and to the damage of the shipper,
The second count charges the consignees with not having exercised reasdnable diligence in keeping and selling the cotton; but
that they dealt with the same so negligently and carelessly, so that
it was sold at a loss to the shipper.
The third count alleges, that the consignees did not sell the cotton to the best interests, of the shipper, nor did they obey his instructions; but on the contrary, managed the same carelessly and
negligently, and sold the same contrary to orders, with a reasonable
prospect of rise of the article, for three thousand dollars less than the
value of the cotton, at the time the same was sold.
The case was removed, under the provisions of the Judiciary
Act of 1789, to the Circuit Pourt of the United States, for the District of Georgia; the defendants below not being citizens of the
state of Georgia, and not residing in that state.
The defendants pleaded the general issue, and the cause having
been tried in the Circuit Court, the jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff, Thomas M'Gran, under the directions of the Court, for four

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

481

[Brown and Company vs. M'Gran.]

thousand nine hundred and seventy-five dollars and fifty-seven
cents. The defendants excepted to the ruling of the Circuit Court;
on questions submitted during the trial of this cause, and they
prosecuted this writ of error.
On the trial it was given iii evidence, that two hundred bales of
cotton were shipped by defendant in error, from Mobile, to the
plaintiffs in error, at Liverpool, as his factors, to be sold by them
under a del credere commission. That this cotton was received by
them about the 9th of April, 1833, and cost, per invoice, nine thousand one hundred and fifty-one dollars and seventy-seven cents.
That the plaintiffs in error, through Brown, Brothers, and Company,
their house in New York, accepted, early in March, 1833, a draft
of defendant in error, for nine thousand dollars, drawn against said
cotton, upon their said house in New York; that when this draft
arrived at maturity, the said house in New York paid the same,
and in order to reimburse themselves, and in pursuance of an arrangement between plaintiffs in error and defendant in error, drew
upon the plaintiffs in error, at Liverpool at sixty days' sight, for one
thousand eight hundred and seventy-one pounds and nine pence
sterling. This draft was dated May 7th, 1833, was accepted by
plaintiffs in error, at Liverpool, June 3d, 1833, and fell due and
was paid by them on the 5th of August following. That by the
contract between the plaintiffs in errlr, and the defendant in error,
the cotton in question became pledged by the defendant in error to
the plaintiffs in error, to enable them to meet their acceptances and
repay their advance thereon.
After shipping the cotton and drawing against it as aforesaid, the
defendant in error became insolvent.
On June 3d, 1833, plaintiffs in error sold said two hundred bales
of cotton for two thousand and seventy-three pounds four shillings
and sixpence, cash, September 16th 1833; being a profit of about
ten per cent. On the same day on wtiich they sold this cotton, they
sold six hundred and seventy-seven bal es, in which their Baltimore
house was interested; and, in a week previous, had sold two hundred and sixteen bales, in which their Baltimore house was also interested.
At the time of the sale of the two huindred bales of cotton, the
defendant in error was indeboed to plaintiffs in error in a large sum.
During the week in which the two hundred bales were sold, the
sales of cotton amounted to forty-seven thousand two hundred and
fifty bales: a larger amount than irrany previous week for about
eight years.
On April 20th, 1833, the defendant in error wrote to plaintiffs in
error: "If you have any cottons on hand when this reaches you,
in which I am interested, I wish you to hold them until you hear
from me again."
This letter was received by William and James Brown and Cornpany, on the 23d of May, 1833; and on the day following, the 24th
of May, 1833, they wrote to Thomas M'Gran: "We are in posVOL. XIV.-2 S

[Brown and Company vs. M,Gran.]

session of your esteetned favour of the 2oth ultimo, and your wishes'
in respect to the cotton we now hold on your account, are noted accordingly."
. On June 9th,following, the plaintiffs in error wrote to defendant, annexing a circular, showing the extensive business done in cotton
during the week, and a material improvement in prices; and informed him that, believing this advance would probably equal
the expectations he had formed when he last wrote, and thinking it desirable to close his cotton in'threir hands, as they had
then been drawn upon for the advance on it,. they had taken advantage of this brisk demand to dispose of the two hundred bales
at an advance of one-half to five-eighths of a penny per pound
u pon its value when first landed.
On July 30th, 1833, the defendant in error replied to the last letter,
referring to his previous letter of April 20th, and asked of plaitiffs
in error, "why did you sacrifice my cottons as the draft drawn by
Brown) Brothers, and Company, at sixty days, on account of these
cottons, could not have been accepted more than a day or two before ? Therefore, you had sixty day's before you had any money
He adds: "IJ do not recognise the sale; and do
to pay for me."
not'consider you authorized to sell the cotton before the time the
draft drawn on you by, Brown, Brothers, and Company, against this
cotton, falls due. If the price is higher on that day than the day
you sold it, I Will expect you to allow me the difference; and if it
is lower, I will be prepared to pay you any balance I may owe
you."
On September 4th, 1833, the plaintiffs in error replied, that there had
been a balance due to them from defendant; that the two hundred
bales were sold at an advance, and barely squared the accounts. That
defendant had been obliged to stop payment, that any loss would
be certain to fall on them, and profit not likely to go to him, but to
his creditors. That the cotton was not sacrificed, but sold at a profit,
such as is not frequently realized on that article; that they sold some
on account of their Baltimore house, and some immediately before,
and immediately after, in which their said Baltimore house was interested. That near fifty thousand bales changed hands in the
same week. That, situated as the defendant in error then was, he
could not reasonably have expected them to hold the cotton, without
pointing out in what manner they should be indemnified in event of
loss thereby. That the fact that Brown, Brothers, and Company's
draft was not due did not alter the case, as they had become responsible some months before, by Brown, Brothers, and Company's acceptance of the draft of the shippers.
On July -92d, 1833, the defendant in error wrote to plaintiffs, that
he had received their favour of the 24th of May, and noted the
contents. That they would please to sell the two hundred bales soon
after the receipt of the letter, unless they were of opinion they could
do better by holding a little longer. This letter was reseived by
the plaintiffs in error, August 23d, 1833.

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

483

[Brown and Company vs. M'Gran.]

The counsel for the defendant below, prayed the Court to instruct
the jury, that the matters given in evidence on the part of the defendants were sufficient, and ought to be admitted to bar the plaintiff's action; which instruction the Court refused to give.
And the Court further refused to instruct the jury:1. That the advance by the house of Browns, in New York, was
in effect an advance by the house inLiverpool; and after the advance so made, the shipper had no right to alter the instructions
which were given at the time of such advance.
2. That the house in Liverpool having advanced so large an
amount on this cotton, having a large previous unsettled claim
against the shipper, and the said shipper having afterwards, and
Dbefore the sale of the cotton, become insolvent; the house in Liverpool had a right t9 sell for their reimbursement, notwithstanding the
subsequent orders of the shipper.
And the Court instructed the jury that it was their exclusive
province to decide from the evidence in the cause, whether the defendants had advanced any, money to the plaintiff on the ctton
shipped by the Mary and Harriet. Whether, when the defendants
sold said cotton, the plaintiff was indebted to them upon a previous
unsettled claim, and whether the plaintiff had become insolvent before the sale of said cotton - and also further instructed the jury,
that if they found from the evidence in the cause, that the plaintiff
had given instructions to the defendants by his letter of the 20thoof
April, 1833, not to sell any cottons which the defendants might
have on hand when that letter reached them, in which the plaintiff
was interested, until the defendants heard from him again, and that
such instructions were received and recognised by the defendants,
by the evidence in the cause, and particularly by a letter given in
evidence as one from the defendants to the plaintiff, dated the 24th
of May, 1833, in reply to the plaintiff's letter to them of the 20th
of April, 1833 ; that then the defendants were not justifiable in law
in the sale of the 3d of June, 1833, on account of the defendants
having on that day accepted Brown, Brothers, and Company's draft
for one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one pounds and ninepence, dated 7th of May, 1833, at sixty days' sight.
And the Court further instructed the jury, that if they found from
the evidence in the cause, that cottons were selling for a higher price
from the 3d June, 1833, when the draft was accepted, and when
the cotton was sold, until the time when the said draft was mature
and payable, and if the evidence in the cause ascertains at any time
before the maturity of the draft, what such higher price was, and
that the cotton belonging to the plaintiff could have been sold for
such higher price; that then the plaintiff was entitled to recover from
the defendants the difference in price between the sum for which
the defendants sold the plaintiff's cotton, and the sum at which it
might have been sold before or at the maturity of the draft.
The defendants in the Circuit Court, excepted to these instructions.

SUPREME COURT.
[Brown and Company vs. M'Gran.]

The case was argued by Mr. G. W. Brown,.for the plaintiffs in
error; and by Mr. Jones, for the defendant.
Mr. Brown contended,
1. That although an agent is generally bound to conform to the
instructions of his principal, the circumstances of this case were
such as to give the plaintiffs in error a right to sell the cotton in
question, notwithstanding the letter of the defendant in error, of
April 20th, 1833.
The cotton was shipped by M'Gran to the Browns, as his factors;
and this circumstance alone was equivalent to an authority to sell.
The definition of a factor is, "an agent who is commissioned- by a
merchant or other person to sell goods for him, and to receive the
proceeds." Selw. .N. P. 827. If at the time when the consignment
was made, the consignor had given instructions as to the manner or
time of sale, the consignees would have been bound to comply with
them. But no such instructions were given. This was a general
consignment; and the evidence, discloses the fact that, upon the faith
of this consignment, the Browtns accepted bills to the amount of
nearly the full value of the cotton. The invoice cost of the, cotton
was nine thousand one hundred and fifty one dollars and seventyseven cents; the bill drawn against it amounted to nine thousand
dollars. The evidence further shows-and all the evidence in the
case was offered by the defendant in error-that this bill was
accepted by the plaintiffs in error, through their house in New York
of Brown, Brothers, and Company. When this bill arrived at maturity, itwas paid by the house in New York, who, in order to
reimburse themselves, drew a bill upon the plaintiffs in error, dated
May 7th, 1833, at sixty days' sight, for one thousand eight hundred
and seventy-one pounds and'nine pence, which was accepted by
them, June 3d, 1833, and fell dde and was paid on the 5th of August following. This arrangement was in conformity with the contract made by the parties, was in accordance with the regular course
of trade, and was highly advantageous to the shipper. The cotton
arrived at Liverpool, April 9th, 1833, and was not sold until June
3d-a period of fifty-five days. At the time of the. sale, M'Gran
was indebted to the plaintiffs in error in a considerable balance,
and had become insolvent.
Under these circumstances, it is contended, that the plaintiffs in
error acquired a special property in the cotton, with a power of sale,
in order to reimburse themselves for the advance made through
their house in New York, and to put themselves in funds to meet
their acceptance of the bill drawn by said house against the shipment. 2 Kent's Com. 640. 642. Story on Bailments, 204, 205. 218.

[Brown and Company vs. M'Gran.]

upon your consignment, provided we have the right of selling, in
order to put ourselves in funds to meet our acceptance." That such
a right to sell existed, seems to be admitted by M'Gran throughout
the correspondence; notwithstanding his complaints as to the time
when the sale was made.
Upon the principles of commercial law, M'Gran, having drawn
upon the Messrs. Brown without having funds-in their hands, was
bound to put them in funds to meet the bill so drawn. Bainbridge
& Co. vs. Wilcocks, 1 Baldw. Rep. 538.

goods to secure an acceptance or advances, and the case of a mortgage with a power to sell annexed. Drinkwater vs. Goodwin,

1 Bell's Com. § 413,

4th edit. And, a fortiori, it could not be revoked by the mere
expression of M'Gran's wishes, contained in his letter of April 20th.
M'Gran does not "order" nor "direct;" he does not even " request ;"
but makes use of the mildest word that can express the idea of desire ;
he simply " wishes." But it will be contended, that M'Gran's wishes
became binding upon the plaintiffs in error, upon their supposed assent
contained in their reply of May 24th, 1833. They there say that
they had received the letter of defendant in 6rror, and that his wishes
in respect to the cotton they then held on his . account were "noted
accordingly." The expression means nothing more than that they
observed the wishes of their correspondent, as contained in his letter;
they do not promise to comply with them in all events; they reserve
to themselves the privilege of giving effect to them or not, as might
be consistent with the protection of their own interests and legal
rights. The expression "to hote" never properly means to assent;
and no usage can be found to justify our attaching to it such a signification in this case. Crabbe's Syn. Webster's Dict.
There are many much stronger cases in the law, where similar
expressions have been decided not to be equivalent to an assent.

But if, in mercantile language, the expression conveys the idea of
assent, there should be some evidence offered of that fact. The
learned judge before whom the case was tried, erred in leaving it to
the jury to say, 1st. Whether defendant in error, by his letter of
April 20th, instructed the plaintiffs in error; and 2d. Whether the
plaintiffs in error recognised these instructions; when no evidence
whatever was laid before the jury to enlighten them as to the
meaning of the expressions used. Story on Agency, 63. 72, n. 1.

Macbeath vs. Haldimand, 1 Term'Rep. 172.
M'Gran, in his letter of July 30th, in which he complains of the
sale of the cotton, really admits the right of the Browns to sell, in
order to meet the bill drawn on them. He says, "I do not recognise the sale, and do not consider you authorized to sell the cotton
bhore the draft dra'wn on you by Brown, Brothers, and Company,
against this cotton, falls due. If the price is higher on that day than
the day you sold it, I will expect you to allow me the difference;
and if it is lower, I will be prepared to pay you any balanc- I may
owe you."
Now this abandons the whole ground. M'Gran, by his letter of
April 20th, had instructed, as it iscontended on the other side, the
plaintiffs in error not to sell until they heard from him again. They
did not hear from him again until August 23d, when his next letter,
dated July 22d, and ordering them to sell, was received. Now the
plaintiffs in error were bound by the instructions of M'Gran, or they
were not. If they were bound, they had no right to sell until August 23d, when his orders to sell were received. If they were not
bound, as M'Gran admits-for he concedes that they had a right to
sell at the date of the maturity of the draft, August 5th-then they
were to use their own discretion, as skilful and honest factors, as to
the time of sale. M'Gran admits they had a right to sell in order to
meet the bill, notwithstanding his instructions; but limits them to a
single day-that of the maturity of the draft. This position is
absurd. On that day it might have happened that no purchasers
could be found, or that the cotton had fallen so low that the whole
would not produce enough to meet the bill.
Again, if M'Gran had the right to instruct his factors to hold
his cotton for four months, le would have had the same right to instruct them to hold it for four years. He might have 'done so withlittle inconvenience to himself; for he had received as an advance
nearly the whole invoice cost.
This argument derives much additional force, from the fact that
M'Gran, at the time when the order not to sell was given, had become insolvent, and was in debt to plaintiffs in error.
The policy of the law will induce the Court to uphold the sale.
The Messrs. Brown acted in good faith, and no doubt, with prudence, although the result proved unsatisfactory. They did all that
could be expected, for they acted for M'Gran precisely as they did
for themselves. On the same day they sold six hundred and seventyseven bales, on account. of nine different parties, in part of which
their Baltimore house was interested; and, within a week previously, two hundred and fifteen bales, in which the Baltimore
house was also concerned. A larger business was done at Liverpool in cotton during the week in which the sale was made, than
had been done in any one week for tha preceding eight years. The
cotton was held upwards of fifty days, and sold at a profit of nearly

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

487

(Brown and Company vs. M'Granij"

ten 'per cent. more, according to the testimony, than is generally
realized in that article. Where no fraud is chargeable on an agent,
his conduct ought to receive a liberal and favourable construction.
Drummond et al. vs8 Wood, 2 Caines, 3i0.
But if the plaintiffs in error did recognise the instructions of the
defendant in error, it was merely an admission as to the legal effect
of a contract, and cannot conclude them. 2 Phil. on Ev. 4th edit.,
and cases there cited.
But conceding, for the sake of argument, that the correspondence
in the case amounts to an agreement on the part of the plaintiffs in
error, that they would hold the cotton until instructed by M'Gran
to sell; it is contended that such an agreement would not be binding,
because it was made without consideration.
A valuable consideration had already passed between the parties.
M'Gran had shipped cotton to plaintiffs in error, who, upon the
faith of the shipment, had come under an advance and acceptance
to a large amount; the contract was then concluded, and binding
upon both parties, and no new agreement could be engrafted upon
it without a new consideration. To make a contract binding, the
consideration must be either a benefit to the party promising, or
some trouble or prejudice to the party to whom the promise is made;
but here there was merely a gratuitous undertaking on the part of
the plaintiffs in error to comply with the wishes of the defendant in
error. Suppose that M'Gran, in his letter of the 20th of April, had
written to the Messrs. Brown that he had become dissatisfied with
their conduct as his factors, and requested them, upon the receipt of
his letter, to deliver the cotton to some other agent named by him, and
that the Messrs. Brown had replied, that they had received his
letter, and noted his wishes accordingly. Could it be for a moment
contended that upon the strength of this supposed assent, M'Gran
could sustain an action of trover against the plaintiffs in error for
the cotton, without paying the amount of their advances ? But if
the assent of the plaintiffs in'e&ror in the case at bar, was sufficient
entirely to destroy their rights over the cotton in question, there is
no reason why it should not-do so in the case supposed.
2. But it is contended that the Court erred in instructing the jury
that the measure of damages was the difference between the price
for which the cotton was sold, and that which could have been obtaiped at any time from the day of sale to the period when the bill
arrivedat maturity.
The cotton was sold June 3d. On the same day the bill was accepted, and became due August 5th. But M'Gran had, as he alleges,
by his letter of April 20th, forbidden the Messrs. Brown to sell, and
his next letter, authorizing them to sell upon its being received, was
not received until August 23d. If then the plaintiffs were bound by
his instructions, they were not authorized to sell until August 23d ;
and the damage, if any, sustained by him, is for their not selling on
or after that day. But there is no evidence in the case to show

488

SUPREME COURT.
[Brown and Company vs. M'Gran.]

what was the price-of cotton on or after that day, and therefore it
does not appear that M'Gran has sustained any damage whatever.
The relation of principal and agent is governed by the general
rules of the law founded on reason; and if the principal suffers
through the remissness or negligence of the agent, the actual loss
sustained by the principal in consequence of such misconduct, is the
standard by which his damages must be measured. Hamilton et
al. vs. Cunningham, 2 Brock. Rep. 366.'
3. It is also contended, that the Court erred in instructing the
jury, that if they found from the evidence in the cause, that cottons
were selling for a higher price from the 3d June, 1833,.when the
draft was accepted, and when the cotton was sold, until the time
when the draft was mature and payable, and if the evidence in the
cause ascertains, at any time before the maturity of the draft, what
such higher price was, and that the cotton belonging to the defendant in error could have been sold for such higher price, that then the
defendant in error was entitled to recover from the plaintiffs in error
the difference in price between the sum 'for which the plaintiffs in
error sold the cotton of defendant in error, and the sum for which it
might have been sold before or at the maturity of the draft, without
making it necessary for them to find any other fact. This instruction is entirely independent of, and unconnected with, the preceding
instructions of' the Court. Upon finding simply the facts mentioned
in it, the jury were told that they must bring in a verdict for the
defendant in error, without'reference to any of the other important
facts proved in the case. This instruction was calculated to mislead
the jury, and is therefore erroneous. Gist vs. Cockey, 7 Har. and
John. 141.
Mr. Jones,, for the defendant, denied that the acceptance of a

Ile contended thati the letter-of the plaintiffs in error, of the 24th
May, 1833, in answ6r to the letter of Thomas M'Gran, of the 20th
of April, 1833, in which they say, :'your wishes in respect to the cotton we now hold on your account, are noted accordingly," was a contract not to sell the cotton, until further instructions from the owner
of the same. That it amounted to an unequivocal accession, in
terms, to the order of the 20th of April, and to the clearest implication to abide by it.
Yet, on the 23d June, when the time had arrived when the duties
on cotton were reduced, a period when the prices of cotton would
increase, and before the effects of that, and other concurring causes
of a rapidly increasing demand, and proportional advance of prices,
could be fairly developed, they forced his cotton into market, in the

(Brown and Company vs. M'Gran.]

teeth of his order, and of their unqualified accession to its terms
only ten days before.
Cotton continued to advance in the Liverpool market after the
sale; and at the time the plaintiffs in error were authorized by the
subsequent letter of Thomas M'Gran to make sales, it had risen to
a price which fully authorized the verdict of the jury.
But there was no occasion, nor was there any right to sell the
cotton shipped by the defendant in error, for the purpose of reimbursement, until, the acceptance of the bill drawn in New York
should be matured. No advances in cash nad been made by the
house in New York, and nothing had been paid by the house in
Liverpool. The whole accommodation afforded to the shipper of
the.cotton was mere paper facilities, by acceptances in New York;
and when those acceptances became due, by a draft on Liverpool.
Mr. Jones considered that the proper test of the amount of the
damages to which the defendant was entitled, was that which, under
the instructions of the Circuit Court, had been adopted by the jury.
The evidence showed the rise of the price of cotton, and as the
plaintiffs in error were bound to keep it after their receipt of the
lett of the 20th of April, the prices, until the draft was paid,
should be considered as those to which the owner of the cotton was
entitled.
He argued, 1. That as to the instructions rejected by the Court,
they were, both in form and substance, in all their premises, and in
all their conclusions, utterly inadmissible.
2. That the instructions actually given by the Court to the jury,
so far from supplying any cause of complaint, were eveu more
favourable to defendants than any they were strictly entitled to ask,
and in all other respects unexceptionable.
Mr. Brown, in reply.
The argument of the learned counsel for the defendant in error
proceeds upon the ground that the plaintiffs in error had a mere lien
on the cotton in question, which could be waived by such an assent
as is supposed to be implied by their letter of May 24th. But the
authorities cited show that factors, under the circumstances existing
in this case, have something more than a naked lien: they have a
special property in the thing itself; a power of sale, coupled with
an interest; and such a right cannot be waived, without at least an
intention to do so being clearly and unequivocally expressed.
Mr. Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a writ of error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of the
District of Georgia, rendered in an action in which M'Gran, the
defendant in error, was originally plaintiff.
In the spring of 1833, M'Gran, a merchant in Georgia, shipped
two huadred bales of cotton, consigned to the plaintiffs in error, a
house of trade in Liverpool, England, there doing business under
tie firm of William and James Brown and Company, for sale on
62

[Brown and Company vs. M'Gran.]

his account. The shipment was made under an arrangement with
the house of Brown, Brothers, and Company, of New York, composed (as seems admitted) either wholly or in part of the partners
in the Liverpool hous6, by which the New York house accepted a
draft drawn upon them by M'Gran for nine thousand dollars, the
invoice value of the cotton being only nine thousand one hundred
and fifty-one dollars and seventy-seven cents; and were to reimburse themselves by a draft on the Liverpool house. Accordingly,
the New York house on the 12th of March, 1833, addressed a letter
to the Liverpool house, in which they state: "We enclose a bill of
lading for two hundred bales of cotton, shipped by M'Loskey, Hagar, and Company, of Mobile, per ship Mary and Harriet, on account of Mr. Thomas M'Gran of Augusta, on which you will
please effect insurance. This cotton cost, per invoice, nine thousand one hundred and fifty-one dollars and seventy-seven cents.
We have accepted Mr. M'Gran's draft against this cotton, for nine
thousand dollars, for which we shall draw on you for our reimbursement when it matures. In handing this draft for acceptance,
Mr. M'Gran says, he would not have drawn for so. large an advance, were it not that there is a balance at his credit with you,
which has accumulated within the past two years; s( that if this
should not produce enough to meet the advance, it will be covered
by what is at his credit." The existence of any such balance was
utterly denied at the trial; and the Liverpool house contended. that
there was a balance the other way.
The cotton duly arrived at Liverpool on or about the 9th of April,
1833. The New York house drew on the Liverpool house for their
reimbursement, a bill dated the 7th of May, 1833, for one thousand
eight hundred and seventy-one pounds and nine pence, at sixty
days' sight, being the amount of the advance; and that bill was
accepted by the Liverpool house, on the 3d of June, 1833, and became payable, and was paid on the 5th of August following. On
the 3d of June, 1833, the very day of the acceptance, the Liverpool house-sold the two hundred bales of cotton, (the market then
being on the rise,) on a credit, for the nett sum of two thousand and
seventy-three pounds four shillings and sixpence. After deducting
the charges (which amounted to nearly twenty-five per cent.) which
became due and payable on. the 16th of September,'1833; and according to an account current rendered to M'Gran, by the Liverpool house on the 29th of June, 1833, the whole transactions between the parties, including the sale of this cotton, left a balance of
three hundred and ninety-two pounds fifteen shillings and eight
pence, due to M'Gran.
At the time when the shipment was made, and the advance arranged therefor, no instructions were given by M'Gran, touching the
sale of the cotton. It accordingly went to the onsignees, as factors
for sale, the advances having been as above mentioned without any
other contract than that implied by law as between a principal and
a factor, making advances; that is to say, that the factor is to make

[Brown and Company vs. M'Gran.]

sale of the goods, consigned to him, according to his own judgment,
in the exercise of a sound discretion as to the time and mode of sale,
having regard to the usagescf trade at the place of sale; and to
reimburse himself out of the proceeds for his advances, and other
balance due him.
After the shipment and advance were so made, viz., on the
20th of April, 1833, M'Gran addressed'a letter to the Liverpool
house, in which, after acknowledging the receipt of letters of the
4th and 5th of March, from them, he added: "If you have any
cottons on hand when this reaches you, in which I am interested, I
wish you to hold them until you hear from me again." The Liverpool housein a reply to this letter on the 24th of May, 1833, used
the following language: "We are in possession of your esteemed
favour of the 20th ultimo, and your wishes in respect to the cotton
we now hold on your account, are noted accordingly." At this
time by advices received from other correspondents, the Liverpool
house were in possession of information that, at least as early as the
8th of April, 1833, M'Gran had failed in business.
On the 22d of July, 1833, MtGran wrote a letter to the Liverpool
house, acknowledging the receipt of their letter of the 24th of May,
in which he says: "I have your favour of the 31st (the 24th) of
May, and note the contents. You will please sell my two hundred
bales of cotton soon after the receipt of this, unless you are of
opinion you can do better by holding a little longer." This letter
was received by the Liverpool house on or about the 23d day of
August, 1833.
On the 7th of June, 1833, the Liverpool house informed M'Gran
of the sale of the cotton: and in a letter under date of the 30th of
July, 1833, in reply thereto, M'Gran expressed his surprise at the
sale; and added: "I beg leave to refer you to my letter of the 20th
of April last, the receipt of which you have acknowledged, instructing you not to sell any cottons you had on hand, in which I am interested until you heard from me again. Why did you sacrifice
my cottons, as the draft drawn by Brown, ]rothers, and Company
at sixty days on account of these cottons, could not have been accepted more than a day or two before, as it went forward by the
packet of the 8th of May. Therefore, you had sixty days before
you had any money to pay for me." And after some other remarks
in the style of complaint, he adds: "You will please take notice,
that I do not recognise the sale, and do not consider you authorized
to sell the cotton before the time the draft drawn on you by Brown,
Brothers, and Company against this cotton, falls due. If the price
is higher on that day than the day you sold it, I will expect you to
allow the difference; and if it is lower, I will be prepared to pay
you any balance Imay owe you." To this letter the Liverpool
house replied by a letter dated the 4th of September, 1833, in
which they vindicated their conduct, and among other things, said:
"We beg you to bear in mind, that there was a balance due us from
you, on joint transaction from Mr. Clarke; that the two hundred

[Brown and Company vs. M'Gran.]

bales in question were sold after the market had advanced one-half
penny per pound, and that it barely squares the account. You had,
unfortunately, been objiged to stop payment. We had the opportunity of paying ourselves by selling your cotton in a brisk market
to a profit of ten per cent.; and we ask whether it was reasonable,
under such circumstances, to expect us to hold the cotton for the
chance of further profit, when the loss, if any, was certain to fall
on us, and the profit not likely to go to you, but to your creditors,
as was supposed, of whom we knew nothing. This would have
been the extreme of injustice toward ourselves and our absent partAnd after some other
ners, without being any advantage to you."
remarks vindicatfng their conduct; they farther said: "We think
you must admit, that situated as you then were you could not reasonably have expected us to hold the cotton, without pointing out
in what manner we should be indemnified in event of loss thereby.
That Brown, Brothers, and Company's draft was not due, does not
alter the case. We had become responsible some months before by
Brown, Brothers, and Company's acceptance of the draft of the
shippers."
Here the correspondence between the parties seems to have
closed. The present action was brought to recover damages against
the Liverpool house, for a supposed breach of orders, and of their
duty as factors. At the trial there was an account current between
the parties, and other evidence before the jury; the whole evidence
in the case, however, was introduced by M'Gran. Among other
questions before the jury, were the following: whether the advance
made by the New York house, was, in effect, an advance by the
Liverpool house, either as agents, or as partners in the latter;
whether there was any balance due to thb Liverpool house upon
the former transactions; whether M'Gran was insolvent or not, according to the advices received by the Liverpool house; and
whether, under the circumstances disclosed in the evidence, the
Liverpool house had a right to sell the two hundred bales of cotton
for their reimbursement, notwithstanding the wishes or orders contained in the letter of the 20th of April.
The jury at the trial found a verdict for the plaintiff, (M'Gran,)
for four thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight dollars and fiftyseven cents, under certain instructions given by the Court, upon
which verdict judgment was accordingly rendered: and a bill of
exceptions'having been taken by the original defendants; the cause
now comes before us for revision, upon the points made and instructions given at the trial.
The counsel for the defendants asked the'Court to instruct the
jury, 1. That the advance by the house of Brown, in New York,
was, in effect, an advance by the house in Liverpool ; and after the
advance so made, the shipper had no right to alter the instructions
which were given at the time of such advance. 2. That the house
in Liverpool having advanced so large an amount on this cotton,
having a previous unsettled claim against the shipper, and the

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

493

[Brown, and Company v8. MIGran.]

shipper having afterwards and before the sale of the cotton, become
insolvent, the house in Liverpool had a right to sell for their reimbursement, notwithstanding the subsequent orders of the shipper.
The Court refused to give these instructions; and, in our judgment,
with great propriety; as each of them involved matters of fact in
contro'rersy before the jury upon which it was exclusively their
province to decide. If- the defendants meant to draw from the
Court an opinion in point of law upon the assumed facts, the
proper mode would have been to have asked the Court to instruct
the jury, that if they found the facts to be as thus assumed, then
that the law was as these instructions stated.
The Court then proceeded to 'instruct the jury, that if they found
from the evidence in the cause that the plaintiff had given instructions to the defendants, by his letter of the 20th of April, 1833,
not to sell any cottons which the defendants might have on hand
when that letter reached them, in which the plaintiff was interested,
until the defendants heard from him again ; and that such instructions were. received and recognised by the defendants, by the evidence in the cause, and particularly by a letter given in evidence as
one from the defendants to the plaintiff, dated the 24th of May,
1833, in reply to the plaintiff's letter to them of the 20th of April,
1833 ; that then the defendants were not justifiable in law in the
sale of the 3d of June, 1833, on account of the defendants having
on that day accepted Brown, Brothers, and Company's draft for
one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one pounds and nine
pence, dated the 7th of May, 1833, at sixty days',sight.
It is observable that this instruction is given in absolute terms,
without reference to any other facts in the cause which might be
found by the jury upon the evidence before them ; and therefore
must be deemed to apply to every posture of the facts which the
evidence might warrant. It must, therefore, be deemed to apply to
the case, although the advance was originally made by the New
York house for and on account of the Liverpool house, as agents
or partners thereof; or the Liverpool house had entered into engage-ments prior to the advance, to become responsible for the reimbursement thereof to the New York house, in the manner stated in the
evidence; and although the plaintiff was, before the writing of the
letters, actually insolvent, and had failed in business; and that fact
was known to the defendants.
One objection taken to this instruction is, that it leaves to the jury
the construction of the language of the letters of the 20th of April,
and 24th of May. It is certainly true, as a general rule, that the
interpretation of written instruments properly belongs to the Court,
and not to the jury. But there certainly are cases, in which, from
the different senses of the words used, or their obscure and indeterminate reference to unexplained circumstances, the true interpretation of the language may be left to the consideration of the jury for
the purpose of carrying into effect the real intention of the parties.
This is especially applicable to cases of commercial correspondence,
VOL. XIV.-2 ,T

494

SUPREME COURT.,
[Browi and Company va. M'Gran.]

where the real o1jects, and intenitions, and agreements of the parties,
are often to be arrived at only by allusions to circumstances which
are but imperfictly developed. The-present case sufficiently illustrates. the -distinction. M'Gran, in the letter of the 20tl of April,
says, that he wishes the defendants to hold any cottons on hand
until they hear from him again. Now, this language, certainly,
ordinarily imports only adesire, and not an order; and yet there
can be no reasonable doubt, that under particular circumstances a
wish expressed by a consignor 1,o a factor mayamount to a positive
command. So, in the reply of the 24th of May, the defendants say,
"your wishes in respect to the cotton we now hold on your account,
are noted acordingly."
Here again the point is open, whether the language imports that
the defendants construed the wishes of the plaintiff to be simply a
strong expression of desire or opinion, or a positive order; and also,
whether the words "no t e d accordingly" import that the defendants
took notice 'thereof, or took notice of, and assented to obey, the
wishes or order of the plaintiff. 'The language is susceptible of
either interpretation, according to circumstances. If the case had
been one of simple consignment, without any interest in the cQnsignee, or any advance or liability incurred on account thereof, the
wishes miglt fairly be presumed to, be orders; and the noting the
wishes, accordingly, an assent to follow them. But very different considerations might apply'where the consignment should be, as the
present is, one clothed with.a special interest and a special property,
founded upon advances ard liabilities. We think, therefore, that
this objection is not, under the circumstances of the case, maintainable.- It would be quite another question, whether the Court might
not in its discretion have assumed upon itself the right and duty of
construing these letters. There is no novelty in this doctrine. It
will be found recognised in Ekins vs. Macklish, Ambler Rep. 184,
185. Lucas vs. Groning, 7 Taunt. Rep.'164; and Rees vs. Warwick, t'Barn. and AId. 113. 115.
But the main objection to the instruction is of a more broad and
comprehensive character. The instruction in effect decides that in
the case of a general consignment of goods to az factor for sale, in
the exercise of his own-discretion, as to the time and manner of
sale, the consignor has a right, by subsequent orders, to suspend or
postpone the sale at his pleasure; notwithstanding the factor has, in
consideration of such general consignment, already made advances,
or incurred liabilities for the consignor, at his request, trusting to the
fund for his due reimbursement. We are of opinion that this doctrine is not maintainable in point of law. We understand the true
doctrine on this subject to be this: Wherever a consignment is
made to a factor for sale, the consignor has a right, generally, to control
the sale thereof, according to his own pleasure, from time to time, if
no advances have been made or-liabilities incurred on account thereof;
and the factor is bound to obey his orders. This arises from the
ordinary relation of principal and agent. If, however, the factor

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

495

. [Brown and Company v8. M'Gran.]

makes advances, or incurs liabilities on account of the cQnsignment,
by which he acquires a special property therein ; then the factor has
a right to sell so much of the consignment as may be necessary to
reimburse such advances or meet such liabilities; unless there is some,
existing. agreement between himself and the consignor, which controls or varies this right. Thus, for example, if contemporaneous
with the consignment and advances or liabilities there are orders
giiven by the consignor which are assented to by the factor, that the
goods shall not be sold until a fixed time, in such a case, the consignment is presumed to be received by the factor subject to such
orders ;,and he is not at liberty to sell the goods to reimburse his advances or liabilities, until after that time has elapsed. The same
rule will apply to orders not to sell below a fixed price; unless, indeed, the consignor shall, after due notice and request, refuse to provide any other means to reimburse the factors. And in no case will
the factor be at liberty to sell the consignment contrary to the orders
of the consignor, although he has made advances, or incurred liabilities thereon; if the consignor stands ready, and offers to reimburse
and discharge such advances and liabilities.
On the other hand, where the consignment is made generally,
without any specific orders as to the time or mode of sale, and the
factor makes advances or incurs liabilities on the footing of such
consignment, there the legal presumption is, that the factor is intended to be clothed with the ordinary rights of factors to sell in
the exercise of a sound discretion, at such time And in such mode
as the usage of trade and his general duty require and to, reimburse
himself for his advances and liabilities, out of the proceeds of the
sale: and the consignor has no right, by any subsequent orders,
given after advances have been made or liabilities incurred by the
factor, to suspend or control this right of sale, except so far as respects the surplus of the consignment, not necessary for the reimbursement of such advances or liabilities. Of course, this right of
the factor to sell to reimburse himself for his advances and liabilities, applies with stronger force to cases where the consignor is
insolvent, and where, therefore, the consignment constitutes the only
fund for indemnity.
Such then being the relative rights and duties of the parties, we are
of opinion that the instruction given to the jury by the learned judge
in the Circuit Pourt, is not maintainable in point of law. The consignment was general to the Liverpool house, for sale; the advances
and liabilities were contemporaneous with the consignment; there
were no contemporaneous orders limiting or qualifying the general
rights of the factors resulting from these circumstances; the consignor, subsequently, either failed in business, or was believed to
have failed; the wishes subsequently, expressed by the letter of the
20th of April, even admitting them to have the force of orders, were
unaccompanied with any other means of indemnity, or even with
any offer of reimbursement of the advances or liabilities. Unless,
then, upon the established principles of law, the consignor had a

40

,SUPREXE_COURT.,
[Brown and Uonpany va. M'Gran.]

clear right to control the sale of the consignment, by any orders
which he might in his discretion choose to give, notwithstanding
such advances .nd liabilities; which we are of opinion he had not;
the instruction was erroneous.
We have not thought it necessary to enter upon any general examination of theiiuthorities which support the doctrines which have
heen thus stated by us But the opinion of Lord Chief Justice
Gibbs, in Pothonier vs. Dawson, 1 Holt's Rep. 383, and the opinions
of the judges in Graham vs. Dyster, 6 Maule and Selw. 1. 4, 5, will
he found fully to recognise some of the leading principles.
Another instruction was given by the Court to the jury upon the
question of damages, supposing the Liverpool house, by the sale,
had violated their proper duty. It was, that if the jury found, from
the evidence in the cause, that cottons were selling for a higher price
from the 3d of June, 1833, when the draft was accepted, and when
the cotton was sold, until the time when the said draft was mature
and payable, and if the evidence in the cause ascertain at any time
before the maturity of the draft, what such higher cprice was, and
that the cotton belonging to the plaintiff could have been sold for
such higher price; then the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the
defendants the difference in price besween the sum for which the
defendants sold the cotton, and the sum at which it might have been
sold befbre or at the maturity of the draft. This instruction was
doubtless framed upon the ground that this was the claim of damages which the plaintiff asserted by his letter of the 30th of July,
1833. Bu. as that letter was not assented to, or the claim recognised by the defendants, this claim could, in no just sense, be obligatory upon them; and as a general rule of law, applicable to
damages under like circumstances, we think that it cannot be maintained.
Supposing the sale made by the defendants on the 3d of June to
have been tortious, and in violation of orders, the plaintiff had his
election either to claim damages for the value of the cotton on that
day, as a case of tortious conversion, ox for the value of the cotton
on the 23d of August following, when the letter of the plaintiff of
the 22d of July was received, which authorized a sale. If the
price of cotton was higher on that day than at any intermediate period, he was entitled to the benefit thereof. If, onthe other hand,
the price Was then lower, he could not justly be said to be damnified
to any extent beyond what hewould lose by the difference of the price
of cotton on the 3d of June, and the price on the 23d of August.
For these reasons, we are of opinion, that both the instructions given
by the Circuit Court to the jury were erroneous; and therefore the
judgment ought to be reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to that Court to award a venire facias de novo.
