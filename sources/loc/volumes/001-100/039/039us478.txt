SUPREME COURT.

THE UNITED STATES, APPELLANTS, VS. THE HEIRS OF ELEAZER
WATERMAN, APPELLEES.
A grant of land by the government of Florida, made before the cession of Florida to the
United States by Spain, confirmed .every point involved in the ease having been conHu
|ively settled by the Court in their former adjudications in similar cases.

APPEAL from the Superior Court of East Florida.
The case was submitted to the Court, on the record, by Mr. Gilpin, Attorney General, for the United States.

Mr. Justice

BALDWIN.,

This case comes up by appeal from the Superior Court of East
Florida, in which the claim of the appellees to a tract of land
described in the record, was confirmed by a decree of that Court,
proceeding pursuant to the acts of Congress for the final adjustment
of claims to land in that territory.
It has been very candidly and properly admitted by the Attorney
General, that every point involved in the case has been conclusively
settled by this Court, in their former adjudications on similar cases;
it therefore becomes unnecessary to state the nature of the claim now
before us, further than that it is founded on a lawful grant, on conditions which have been fully terformed by the grantee. This Court
therefore orders, adjudges, and decrees, that the decree of the Court
below, adjudging that the title of the appellees is valid under the
treaty of 22d February, 1821, between the United States and Spain,
the laws and customs of Spain, the law of nations, and of the United
States, be, and the same is hereby, affirmed; and the cause is remanded to the Court below, with directions to further proceed therein, and to cause such further proceedings to be had as by law is
directed.
