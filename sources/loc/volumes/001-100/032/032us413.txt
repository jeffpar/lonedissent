JXMES W BREEDLOVE AND WILLIAM L. ROBESON, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR V. THEOD3RE NICOLET AND J. J. SIGG.
Jurweadn. The plaintiffs, aliens, were residents of the state of Louisiana
at the time of the execution of the note sued on in the district court of
the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana, and continued to
reside in New Orleans since, having a commercial house there; they are,
however, absent six months in the year; but when absent have their agent
to attend to their business. The defendants in the suit were residents
of the city of New Orleans, and citizens of the state of Louisiana, when
the note was A'ven. The residence of aliens within the state constitutes
no objection to the jurisdiction of the federal court.
The commercial partnership, the drawers of the note upon which the suit
was instituted, was composed of three persons, one of whom was a resident citizen ofAlabama, and out of the jurisdiction of the court when the
suit was brought, and the remaining tyio, the defendants, were resident
citizens of Louisuia. Held: that although the suit being against two of
the three obligors might not be sustained at common law; yet as the
courts of Loutsiana do not proceed according to the rules of the common
law, their code being founded on the civil law, this suit is properly

brought.
The note being a commercial contract, is what the law of Louisiana denonn.
nates a contract %naolido, by which each party is bound severally as well
as jointly, and, may be sued severally as well as jointly.
The plamtif Sigg was denominated in the petition and writ "J. J. Sigg."
The omission of his christian name at full length was alleged as error. By
the court. He may. have hai no christian name. He may have assumed
the letters "3. J." as distinguishing him from other persons of the name
of Sigg. Objections to the name of the plaintiff cannot betaken advantage of after judgment. If J. J. Sigg was not the persoi to whom
the promise was made; was not the partner of Theodore Nicolet & Co.,
advanitge should have been taken ofit sooner. It is too late toallege it
as error in this court.

The petitioners aver that they are.aliens. This averment is not contradicted
on the record, and the court cannot presume that they are citizens.
If orig ally aliens, they did not cease to be so, or lose their right to sue
in the federal court, by a residence m Louisiana. Neither the constitution nor the acts of congress require that aliens should reside abroad to
entitle them'to sue inthe courts of the United States.
The suit not having been brought against Bedford, one of the partnership,
it was n6t necessary to aver that he Was subject to the jurisdiction of the
courts of the United States.
After issue joined m the district court, the defendants filed a plea that the
firm of Theodore Nicolet and Company, the plaintfs, consisted of other

SUPREME- COURT
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]
persons in addition to those named in the.writ and petition, and that those
other persons were citizens of Louisiana. The court, after receiving the
plea, directed that it be taken from the files of the court. Held, that
tis was a proceeding in the discretion of the court; and was not assignable-as error in this court.
The plea was offered after issue was joined on a plea in bar, and the argument of the cause had commenced. The court might admit it; and the
court rmght also reject it. It was in the discretion of the court to allow
or refuse tis additional plea As it did not go into the merits of the case,
the court would undoubtedly have acted right in rejecting it.
All the proceedings in a case are supposed to be within the control of the
court while they are in paper, and before a jury is sworn, or judgment
given. Ordersmade may.be revised, and such as in the judgment of the
court may have been irregular or improperly made, may be set aside.
Construction of the insolvent laws of Louisiana.
IN eiror from the district court of the United States for the
pastern district of Louisiana.
This action was instituted in the district court by Theodore

Nicoletiand J. J. Sigg, both averred to be aliens, and citizens
and subjects of the republic of Switzerland, but at present re-

siding and trading in the city of New Odlrns, under the firm
and style of Theodore Nicolet & Co.
The petition of the plaintiffs sets out a joint and several de-

mAnd against J. R. Bedford, James W Breedlove, and William

L. Robeson, fonierly partners in trade, and doing basiness m the
said city under the firm and style of Bedford, Breedlove & Rob-

estn. The cause of action was a promissory note, subscribed by
Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, for two thousand nine hundred and sixty-four dollars and ten cents, dated at New Orleahs 22d November 1826, payable sixty days after date to the
order of the petitioners. The petition then avers that said Bed-

ford, Breedlove & Robeson, have become indebted to the petitioners in the amount of said note, with interest and costs.
It further avers that Bre6dlove and Robeson are citizens of

the state of Louisiana, and reside in New Orleans, and that each
of them liable, as aforesaid, and prays that Breedlove and Robeson may be cited, and that judgment be rendered against them,
jointly and severally, for the amount due. Attached to the
petition is an affidavit, setting forth that Breedlove and Robeson are jointly and severally indebted, &c.

Two separate writs of capias ad respondendum were issued,

JANUARY TERM 1833
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.)

the one against Robeson, the other against Breedlove, upon
which they were severally arrested and held to bail, under a
special order of the judge.
In June 1829, the defendants filed their joint and separate
answer to the petition, in which, reserving all legal exceptions,
they aver that the said commercial house of 'Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, of which they were partners, having become
embarrassed by misfortunes, after the execution of the note
sued on, to wit, March 16, 1827, made out a full and complete
schedule, exhibiting the debts due by them, and the property
and debts belonging and due to them jointly and severally,
whith said property was duly accepted by the judge of the parsh court, for the benefit of the creditors placed upon said schedule..
Among their creditors were the plaintiffs, Theodore Nicolet
& Co. then residents of New Orleans, in the state of Louisiana, and who were also residents of the same place at the time
of the execution of the note now sued on.
After the said acceptance so made by said parish judge, a
meeting of the creditors of Bedford, Breedlove and Robeson,
was duly called. At the appointed time and place the creditors who assembled approved of the acceptance of the property
made-by the judge as aforesaid. Upon these proceedings judgment of discharge-was finally rendered in favour of the defendants.
Afterwards the original note was filed, to wit, January 4,
1830, and, on the following day, viz. January 5, 1830, the defendants filed a plea to the jurisdiction.
In this plea, after setting out the note, they allege that the
district court cannot properly exercise jurisdiction over the case,
because they allege that'said note was drawn by Bedford,
Breedlove and Robeson, payable to the order of T. Nicolet &
Co., -who indorsed and assigned the same to one Frederick'
Beckman, who indorsed and assigned the same to J. J. Sigg,
who assigned the same to Theodore Nicolet & Co. the present
plaintiffs. The defendants then aver that, said firm of T.
Nicolet & Co. is composed of various other persons than the
said Theodore Nicolet and J. J. Sigg; that, among the -pa.Wt

-SUPREME COURT.
(Breedlove and Robeson v..Nicolet and Sigg.]

ners in said firm, one Germam Mussen, and one M. P Durell,
and one Charles Lessept, all and each of whom are citizens of
the United States, and state of Louisiana.
Further, they aver that Frederick Beckman, a remote mdorser on said note, was, prior to the 5th July, 1828, and at the
time of his transfer to J. J. Sigg, an alien, and* a subject of
the Hanseatiq, Towns: that, on the 5th July, 1828, he became
a citizen of the United States, and state of Louisiana, and was
so at the time of the institution of this suit, &c.
This plea was filed on the 5th January, after the hearing of
the cause had been.commenced, and the objection of the petitioners' counsel against then receiving it, was overruled.
On the 20th May 1830, on motion to reconsider and.annul
the order of January which permitted the defendants to file the
.plea to the jurisdiction, it was objected that it came too late,
the cause having been put upon the jury calenriar, and regularly called on that calendar for trial.
The court rescinded the order. 1st, Because it was not filed
in time; the defendants having pleaded to the merits before oyer
was given of. the note, and, upon this plea, the cause was at
issue when the plea to the jurisdiction was filed. 2d, Oyer of
the note was not necessary to enable a party to plead in abatement the citizenship of the plaintiffs; that both branches of the
plea'to'the jurisdiction deny the capacity of the plaintiffs to sue,
and, therefore, ought to have been pleaded in abatement, and
before issue joined on the merits, and that no material step was
taken in the cause, between the reception of said plea and its
subsequent rejection on reconsideration.
On June 7th, 1830, the cause came on for trial, when the
following facts were admitted on the record
That the persons, composing the firm of T. Nicolet & Co.
wete residents of the state at the'time of the execution of the
note sued, and have continued so up to the present time;
That they are absent about six motliths in the year, but,
when so absent, have their agents to.%ttend to their business,
and their commercial' house has existed in New Orleans ever
since the execution of said note;
That Breedlove and Robeson were residents of the- city of
New Orleans, and citizens of the state of Louisiana.

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

The proceedings. nder the insolvent law of Louisiana were
admitted in evidence.
The plaintiffs filed the protest of the note, which appears to
have been made November 22, 1827, at the nstance of Frederick Beckman.
On the 10th of June 1830, judgment was entered for the
following terms:
The court having maturely considered this case,,now order
and adjudge, that judgment be entered up in favour of the
plaintiffs against the defendants, jointly and severally, for the
sum of twenty-nme hundred and sixty-four dollars and ten
cents, with interest at the rate of five per cent per annum,
from the twenty-fourth day of January 1827, until paid, and
costs of suit.
To reverse this judgment the defendants prosecuted this writ
of error.
The.case was argued by Mr Coxe,for the plaintiffs in error,
and by Mr Livingston, in a printed argument, for the defendants.
Mr Coxe contended that the judgment of the district court
was erroneous, and ought to be reversed.
1. Because the action was irregularly instituted, no process
having been sued out against Bedford, one of the partners, and
the suit being a joint as well as a several one.
2. Because neither in the petition, writ, or in any part of.the
proceedings, is the christian name of Sigg set forth, which is
essential.
3. Because there is no evidence that the petitioners were
aliens, and, as such, authonzed to sue in thp courts of the United
States, but the only facts in the case which can be judicially
recognized, show them to have been at the date of the note,

and still to continue, residents of New Orleans, and of the state
of Louisiana.
4. Because, evan if originally aliens, and never naturalized,
such xesidence deprives a party of-his-right to Pue in the courts
of the ion, a4 an alien.
VOL. VII.- 3 C

SUPREME COURT.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

5. Because there is no averment, or proof, that Bedford, one'
of the parties to the note, was subject to the jurisdiction of the
courts of the United States.
6. Because the plea to the jurisdiction, under the circumstances apparent on the record; was'lawfully filed, and ought
riot to have been taken from the files of the court.
7. Because the plaintiffs, being parties to the insolvent proceedings, were stopped from questioning the sufficiency of'the
discharge.
1. ,The note on its face shows that there were three persons
who were drawers of the instrument, and this is also stated
in the petition for process against the plaintiff in error. The
petition sets forth that by thus jointly drawing the note in question, a joint and several responsibility was incurred. Yet process is prayed only against two of the parties, and no excuse
is assigned for the omission to join the other party, no. death
is suggested, nor is it alleged that two only of the parties to
the note were parties in the firm.
The re nedy on such a contract, is, by the local law of Louisiana, the same as it would be at the common law, as a joint
contract. Civil Code of Louisiana, 678, sect. 2, art. 2080.
But if 'the remedy be several as well as joint, there is equal
error in the judgment of the district court. If-a joint liability
is tobe enforced upon a joint contract, all the parties must be
sued together, or if a separate as well as joint liability is the
obligation of the contract, each of the persons must be sepa-rately sued, if this separate liability is to be -enforced. A suit
against two of them, bound by a joint and several contract,
cannot be maintained. 2 Saund. on P1. and Evid. 708; Streat..
field v. Holliday, 3 T. R. 782. If it appear on the pleadings
that another should have been joined, who has been oiritted;
-the defendant may demur, arrest the judgment, or bring a
writ of error. 1 Saund. Plead. anti Evid. 14.
The judgment is joint and several, For th. 'here is no
authority in the law of Louisiana, and still less in the common
law. Civil -Code of Louibiana, 2081.
2. The omission of. the, christian name of Sigg, one of the

plaintiffs below, is error.

It is essential to all legal proceedings

Pennmgton's Rep. 75, 137.
3. Thereis nothing on the record to show that the plaintiffs
below were aliens, and this was essential to give, as it is to
maintain the junsdictiori of the district court, and- it is. on
the ground of the alienage of the plaintiffs that the jursdiction is'clained. But it appears that"they were residents of
Louisiana at the date of the note, and at the institution of the
suit.
The allegation of alienage.being necessary to give jurisdiction to the court, it must be proved on the.trial, on ihe general
issue. 1 Paine, 194.
The presumption growing out of the facts which appear on
the record is, that the plaintiffs were citizens of Louisiana, and
consequently not authorized to sue other citizens of the same
state in the federal court. If they were originally aliens, as
residents of Louisiana at the time of the contract and of
this suit, they are not competent to sue as aliens in the federal
court.
The language of the constitution in reference to this subject does not employ the techical term "alien," but with a
guarded phraseology confers jurisdiction in cases between "a
state or citizen thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects."
This form of expression seems rather to have been drawn ftom
the laws of nations, than from any muniipal-coide.
The object of this provision was to give, to the general
government, judicial authority over all subjects which mght
involve diplomatic discussion with foreign powerg.
The eleventh section of the judiciary act of 1789, employs
the word "alien," but it must be considered in subordination
to the clause in the constitution. How then is this language
understood in legal adjudication. Cited, 2 Gallis. 130, 2

an individual is to. be dbtermined by the fact of residence.

[Breedlove and Robeson Y.Nicolet and Sigg.]

9. That as to his capacities, as well as his disabilities, the sawe
rule is.to ba. observed.
The consequences of allowing foreigners domiciliated among
us all the privileges of.citizens, and all the immunities of aliens,
are unjust. They thus obtain advantages which ought not to
be conceded to them. Wheneer they please, they may sue
in- the state courts, but their opponents cannot remove the
cause. Whenever they think proper they may sue in the federal courts. Thus the policy of the law and the interests of the.
country are defeated. That policy is to induce aliens of character to become naturalized, but by giving these privileges, bounties are held out to avoid it.
In the same clauses of the constitution, and of this act of
congress, provisions are made in cases of controversies between
citizens of different states.
In settling questions arising under these provisions, the courts
of the United States have exclusively regarded the naked fact
of domicil. There is no such character recogized as a citizen of a state, further than he is a citizen of tjhe United States,
residing in a particular state, 4 Dall. 360, Coxes Dig. 26,
Cooper's Lessee v. Galbraith, 3 Wash. C. C. Rep. 546.
4. According to the law of Louisiana, the parties to suits
may avail themselves of the privilege to have their causes tried
by a jury, or they may prefer adopting the ordinary mode of
a trial by the court. In the latter case, the trial is in conformity with the civil law, and the removal to the superior court
is in the nature of an appeal, carrying up the entire record,
the evidence as well as the pleadings.
The jurisdiction of the appellafe court comprehends errors
in law and- errors in fact, and on this ground there is a fatal
defect, that the record does not exhibit any proof of the parties who constituted the firm of Theodore Nicolet and Com-pany, at the time of the contract. 2 Saund. Plead. and Ev.
704, 5 T. R. 709 ,. the note was payable to Theodore Nicolet
and Company.
It is equally fatal that there is no evidence to show that the
plaintiffs had been made legally liable for the note as mdorsers.
The note had passed into various hands; it was held by one

JANUARY TERM 1833.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg

Beckman; and unless they had been legally charged by the
subsequent holders of the note. with the payment of t, they
would have no right of action against the drawers.
5. The insolvent proceedings in the record show that the
plaintiffs in error were discharged by the court in which tlie
same were instituted. To these proceedings the defendants m
error were parties, and the contract was made with *them in
the state of Louisiana, so that they were bound by the msolvent lawsof this state. Cited Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheaton,
213.
Mr Livingston, for the defendants in error, presented the following printed argument.
The first point made by the plaintiffs in error and defendants
below is, that the suit was irregularly instituted, because no
process was sued .out against Bedford, one of the partners,
the suit it is alleged being joint as well as several.
To maintain this position, the -plaintiffs m error rely on
authorities from the civil code of Louisiana, and others drawn
from the rules of pleading at common law. If the first should
sustain his position, he must prevail, with the second we have
nothing to do in this cause.
L The first inqiry is what was the nature of.the obligation
on which the suit was brought? It is a promissory note drawn
by a mercantile firm consisting of three members; 'of whom
two of the defendants in the original suit reside in the city of
New Orleans, and the other is an inhabitant of Alabama.
The contract, then, being a commercial one, is, by the law
of Louisiana, an obligation -in solido, for the performance of
which each of the parties is severally, as well as jointly, bound,
and may be either jointly or severally sued.
The plaintiffs in error have cited article 2080 of the Civil
Code of Louisiana, which provides that all the parties to a
jotnt contract must be defendants to the suit; this is not denied,
but this is an obligation 2n solido, not a joint one. It is. defined
by articles 2086, of the same code.
"There is an obligation in solido on the part of the debtors
when they are all obliged to the same thing, so that each may
b. compelled for the whole, and when the payment which is

SUPREME COURT.
[Breedlove. and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

made by one of them, exonerates the other." This denntion
is taken from Pothier, Traite d'obigation, part 2, ch. 3,
art. 8, see. 1, No. 261.
"An obligation mi solido is not presumed, it must be expressly stipulated;" but it adds, "this rule ceases to prevail
where an obligatibn in solido takes place of right by virtue of
some provisions of law." Civil Code of Louisiana, art. 2088.
This article is also taken from Pothier, ubi supra, No. 265; and
he gives as one of the cases in which it is presumed "when partners in commerce contract debts on account of their commerce."
This then being a debt so contracted by partners, is an obligation r solido what are its effects as to obligorsI Article 2088.
"The creditor of an obligation in solido may apply to any one
of the debtors he pleases, without the debtor having the right
to plead the benefit of division." If then the plaintifis below
could have sued. each of the partners m a separate suit, the
error relied on is that he has sued two of them. Whether the
common law authorities cited prove the position, is thought
immaterial, because all that is required by the rules of pleading in Louisiana is, that the case be set out according to the
truth, and that the law applicable to it entitles the party
to relief.
Here the facts set forth in the petition are not denied, they
show an obligation on each of the two parties made defendants
to pay a certain sum, the prayer of the petition is that they
may be decreed to comply with it exactly in the manner in
which it was made, and the judgment is m precise conformity
with the law that governs the case.
What would be the effect of allowing the exception? To
force the plaintiff below to bring two actions in order to
produce the same result obtained by one; a result, which
it is the evident intent of the Louisiana mode of proceedmg to avoid. Article 2081 of the Code is cited, to prove that
the judgment ought not to have been jointly and severally
entered: that article only directs the mode in which judgments
on a jotnt obligation shall be rendered, and so far as it applies
to the case, it shows that the judgment must conform to the
nature of the obligation, which it does in our case.
II. The next objection is that the chnstian name of Sigg

JANUARY TERM 1893.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

is omitted; if there be any force m the observation, it comes
now too late, the object of setting forth the name is to prove
the identity of the person, but if that is done -to the satisfaction
of the party below, he cannot take advantage of it here: the
plaintiff in the suit below is designated as J. J. Sigg, this is
sufficient to a common intent; but non cnstat, that he had
any other name. The two letters prefixed to his surname
form distinct sounds, and why may pot the godfather of Mr
Sigg, have given him those namesQ Suppose a woman named
Ellen,.was to called herself in the pleadings L. N. would, it
not be sufficient, unless an exception was made to false spelling. -As well nfight the creditors of the defendants attempt
to set aside their own discharge; the designations of both of
them are liable to the same objections. The one is called
James W Breedlove, and the other, William Ei. Robeson.
now these intermediate letters may either be intended as the
initial of some other name or they may merely be placed there
to designate by their sound, the one individual from another;
this last is a very common occurrence-if then 'a letter can
perform this office when placed between two names, why may
it not when placed simply before one.
III. The third objection, that the plaintiffs below were not
proved to have been aliens is answered in two ways. 1st, Bysaying that this court 'have no means of knowing what was
proved. This is not an appeal. That mode of reviewing
-judgments below is only given to this court, in cases of equity
and admiralty-this case is neither. If the defendants below
had thought the evidence insufficient, they might, have spread
it on the record by a bill of exceptions; This they have not
done.
In the case of Parsons v. Bedford et al. 3 Peters, 433, this
court decided that they could not examine into the 'facts so as
to reverse a judgment below. It is true that was after a verdict,
and the provision of the constitution in that respect was
thought.by the cburt to apply; but the reasons urged by the
counsel and many of them used by the court, would iem to
bear with propriety on a case like this.
In the case of Parsons v. Armor, 3 Peters, 414, the court
went into a consideration of the case. arising on the facts: but

SUPREME COURT.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Gigg.]

they do so under an express declaration that they consider the
ease as coming under the description, either of a bill of exception, or a case submitted, for there all the facts were stated on
the record to have been either agreed by the parties, or stated by
depositions and'documents. Here, on the contrary, there is no
such statement of facts, and the certificate of the clerk is only
that "the foregoing pages contain a transcript of the record
and process, together with ,all the proceedings relating thereunto, the judgment of the court, bills of exception and documents therein referred to, and the writ and citation in error and
return." Not a word mentioned of the evidence. So that
this court cannot determine that no proof was offered that the
plaintiffs below were aliens.
But secondly, whether proof were made of this fact or
not is totally immatena,-it is averred in the petition, and the
only fact m issue by the answer is the discharge.
IV A point not stated in the printed case seems to have been
insisted on at the hearing, viz that it does not appear by the
record, that any proof was made that Nicolet and Sigg are the
persons composing the firm.
To this, the same answers appiy that were give to the
third objection.
V This objection (4th in the printed statement) appears
to be tantamount to saying that residence and citizenship are
synonymous. It has been repeatedly decided, that one of the
parties being a resident-of a different state from the other, will
not give jurisdiction to the courts of the United States. Citizenship or alienage must be satisfactorily stated.
VI. The want, of an averment that Bedford was subject to
the jurisdiction of the court. The answer to this objection
has been anticipated in that which was given to the first error
assigned. Bedford was not a party to the suit. Those only
are parties against whom process is prayed. The contract
beng in solido, he was not a necessary party.
VII. That the court did right in receiving the plea to the
jurisdiction after the trial had begun, and were wrong in afterwards directing it to be withdrawn, is a position which appears
contradictory to the best established rules of pleading. That
the plea came too late. See 1 Mason, 364, The Sloop Abby,

JANUARY TERM 1833.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

1 Peters, 450, 498, 4 Mason, 437, 4 Peters, 480; 1 Martin's
Rep. N. S. p. 4. That the court have a right to reverse their
interlocutory decrees and to ratify an error while within their
reach. 2 Cranch, 33, 3'Martins Rep. N. S.
VIII. An objection, not in the printed copy, seems to have
been insisted on in argument, that by the protest of the note
while m the hands of Beckman, and the record of the suit
brought by Sigg, as well as by the indorsements, it appears
that the note had been the property of those persons respectively, and that it ought to have been snown that they were
capable of suing in the court of the United States. If the objection were good in point of law, it fails under the circumstances of this case, because all the reasoning which applies
to that which is founded on the alleged incapacity of the plaintiffs, may be used against this. But the ground is in itself
untenable, although the payee of a note may have indorsed it
to ar -ther, and he to a third, yet whenever, it comes back to
the nands of the payee, he holds it in his original right, and
not under the subsequent indorsers.
IX. The last ground relied on is, that the appeals were discharged by the proceedings set forth in the recora, and the
cases of Ogdenv. Saunders and Bergh and Zacarie v. Saunders,
are relied on. The inference to be drawn from these decisions
is directly ihe reverse; that aliens and citizens of other states are
not bound by state insolvent or bankrupt proceedings, unless,
as in the case of Clay, the creditor had made himself a party
to the proceedings by appearing or accepting his dividend. But
even admitting that the plaintiffs, as aliens, were bound by a
regular proceeding under the state law, they are not bound by
this.
The proceedings of Breedlove and Robeson are under the
state law, passed 20th February 1817, 2 Lislet's Digest, 424.
That law has several essential provisions, which, before this
court can confirm his discharge, must appear to have been complied with
1. By the eighth section. the judge to whom application is
made, must, after he is convinced that the formalities prescribed
by the act have been -complied with, order the creditors to be
Vor. V.IL.-3 D

SUPREME COURT.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

called, in the manner and within the time directed for repeals
by the Civil Code, art.A4, tit. 16, book 3, this reference islo the
Civil Code then in force, but the same provisions have been
transferred to the new code now before the court, and are
found in article 3054, one part of which is, that "the creditors
shall be summoned to attend by process, issued from the court,
if the creditors live within the parish where the meeting shall
take place." No such process appears by the record, yet the
plaintiffs are admitted to have resided in the parish, and they
excepted to the introduction of the insolvent proceedings,
,because they were not cited as parties (see bill of exceptions,
p. 12).
This is a fatal error. There are many others.
2. The said law does not authorize any judgment of discharge from the debts, as is pronounced by the Parish judge,
in the proceedings (p. 47), see sect. 28.
3. By the second section, the debtor is obliged to file with his
proceedings an account of his losses. No such account appears in his proceedings.
4. By the seventh section, if the appraised value of the property, ourrendered do not amount to more than one third of the
debts, he shall not receive the benefit of the act, unless the
losses are proved .by the oaths of two witnesses. There is no.
appraised property, and no oath to prove the losses.
Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This suit was instituted in the court of the United States for
the eastern district of Louisiana, by Theodore Nicolet and J.
J. Sigg, subjects of the republic of Switzeiland, merchants and
partners, trading under the firm of Theodore Nicolet & Co.,
against James W Breedlove and William L. Robeson, members of a commercial company consisting of J. R. Bedford,
James W Breedlove and William L. Robeson, merchants and
partners, formerly doing business under the firm of Bedford,
Breedlove and Robeson.
The petition, which in the courts of Louisiana supplies the
place of a declaration at common law, is founded on a promissory note in the following words

JANUARY TERM 1833.
[Breedlove and Robeson T. Nicolct and Sigg.]

2964 10.

New Orleans, .Nov. 22, 182U.
Sixty days after date we promise to pay to order of Messrs
Theodore Nicolet & Co. twenty-nine hundred sixty-four and
ten hundredths dollars, value received.
BEDFORD, BREEDLOVE AND ROBESON.

In June 182,9 the defendants filed their plea and answer,
setting forth that after the execution of the said note, their affairs having become embarrassed, they made out a full and
,complete schedule, exhibiting all their property and the debts
due to and from them, ,. Inch said property was duly accepted
by the judge of the Parish court for the benefit of the creditors
placed- on the said schedule, among whom were the plaintiffs.
Theodore Nicole. & Co., who were then and at the time of the
execution of the said note, residents of New Orleans. The answer then sets forth at large the proceedings after the acceptance of the property, and the final discharge of the defendants
by the judgment of the Parish court, given in pursuance of the
laws of the state, which judgment they plead in bar of the
action;
Afterwards, in January 1830, the cause came on for trial,
when the following entry was made. "This cause came on
for hearing before the court, when, after hearing the arguments
of counsel in part, it is ordered that this cause be set for trial
on the jury docket on the plea filed this day." And afterwards,
on the same day, "came the defendants by their counsel and
filed the following plea."
This plea objects to the jurisdiction of the court, because the
note in the petition mentioned was drawn by Bedford, Breedlove and Robeson, payable to the order of Theodore Nicolet &
Co., which said firm of Theodore Nicolet & Co. is composed
of other persons than the said Theodore Nicolet and the said
J. J Sigg to wit, Germain Musson and others, all and each of
whom are citizens of the United States and state of Louisiana.
The plea farther alleges, that Frederick Beckman, a remote
indorser on the said note, had since the indorsement become a
citizen. The plaintiffs objected to the reception of this plea
to the'junsdiction, because it came too late.
a fterwards, in May 1830, the court, on a re-hearing, over-

SUPREME COURT.
[Breedlove and Rlobeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

ruled: the plea. to the jurisdiction which had been received at
the January term. The defendants excepted to this decision.
The cause came on for trial before the court, a jury not hav.
ing been required, when the following admissions were. made.
"It is admitted that the persons composing the firm of T. Nicolet & Co. were residents of the state at the time of the execution of the note sued, and have continued so up to the present date, that they are, however, absent abbut six months ii
the year, but, when so absent, have their agents to attend-to
their business, and that their commercial house has existed m
New Orleans ever since the execution of the said note. It is
also admitted that, at the time of the execution of the said
note, the defendants J. W Breedlove and William L. Robeson
were residents of the city of New Orleans, and citizens of the
state of Louisiana. "
These admissions are of no importance in the cause. -The
residence of aliens within the state constitutes no objection to
the jurisdiction of the federal court.
The defendants offered in evidence the record of the'bank
rupt proceedings from the parish court. It was admitted that
the meeting of the creditors was duly advertised in the publio
prints. The plaintiffs objected to the admission of this record,
but the court determined that it should be read.
The defendants also gave in evidence the record of the proceedings of the court in a suit brought by the plaintiff, J. J.
Sigg, on the same note, against Bedford, Breedlove and Robeson, to which the defendants, James W Breedlove and
William L. Robeson, appeared, and pleaded to the jurisdiction
of the court, on which.the suit was discontinued'on motion of
the plaintiffs' counsel.
In June 1830, the court rendered its judgment in favour of
the plaintiffs for the amount-of the note, with interest, which
judgment is brought before this court by writ of error.
The plaifitifib assign the following errors in the proceedings
of the distnt court.
1st. The action was irregularly instituted, no process having
been sued out against Bedford, one of-the partners, and the
contract being joint as well as several.

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

2d. Neither in the petition, writ, or in any part of the proceedings, is the christian name of Sigg set forth.
3d. There is no evidence that the petitioners are aliens. They
are shown to have been at the date of the note, and to the time
of the tnal, residents of New Orleans.
4th. If originally aliens, their residence in New Orleans renders them incapable of suing in the courts of the United States.
5th. There is no averment or proof that Bedford, one of the
parties to the note, was subject-to the jurisdiction of the court.
6th. The plea to. the jurisdiction was properly filed, and
ought not to have been taken from the files of the court.
7th. The plaintiffs being parties to the insolvent proceedings,
were stopped from questioning the sufficiency of the discharge.
1. The first error assigned, that the suit is brought against two
of three obligors, might be fatal -at common. law But the
courts of Louisiana do not proceed according to the rules of the
common law. Their code is founded on the civil law, and our
inquiries must be confined to its rules.
The note being a commercial partnership contract, is what
the law of Louisiana denotes a contract zn solido, by which each
party is bound teverally as well as jointly, and may be sued
severally or jointly. The Ci'til Code of Louisiana, article 2080,
directs, "that in every suit on a joint contract all the obligors
must be made defendants; and the succeeding article directs
that "judgment must be rendered against each defendant separately, for his proportion of the debt or damages."
Article 2086 says, "there is an obligation 2n solido on the
part of the debtors, where they are all obliged to the same
thing, so that each may be compelled for the whole." Article
2088 says, "an obligation 2n solido is not presumed, it must be
expressly stipulated."
This rule ceases to prevail only in cases where an obligation in solido takes place of right by virtue of some provisions
of the law." Pothier, from whom this article appears to be
taken, part 2, ch. 3, art. 8, gives, in number 266, as one of the
instances in which the law presumes it, "where partners in
commerce contract some obligation in respect of their joint concern."
This then is a contract in solido, on which. the tarties may

SUPREME COURT.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. NicoIet and Sigg.]
be sued severally or jointly, and by which each is liable for the
whole.
The Civil Code, so far as we are informed, does not affirmn or
deny that a suit may be sustained on such a contract against
two of three obligors. The rules of practice in Louisiana, so
far as we understand them, require that the petition should
state the truth of the case,,and should show a right in the petitioner to recover. It is not dnied that this petition states the
case truly, nor is it denied that the petitioner has a right to recover from the defendants the sum demanded. It is alleged
that he has not a right to recover it in the form of action which
he has adopted. He might have obtained a judgment against
each for the whole sum, but not, it is said, against two of them,
in one action: If this be the rule of the common law, it is a
mere technical rule, not supported'by reason or convemence.
No reason other than what is merely technical can be assigned
for requiring the additional labour and expense of two actions
for the attainment of that which may be as well attained by
one. We have no reason for supposing that this techmcal principle has been engrafted on the civil law. The contrary is to
be inferred from the practice of that branch of it with which we
are familiar. It is a rule in chancery that all those against
whom a decree can be made, shall be brought before the court,
if they are within its jurisdiction. A court of equity, proceeding on the principles of the civil law, would not tolerate separate actions in this case. That court, m a case of which it
would take cognizance, might require that all those boun& in
the note should be brought before it in the sarAe suit, not that
separate actions should be brought against those who might be
sued in one. On the principles of the civil law it would seem
that the defendants may be required to account for not jolrtng
the third promissor in the suit, not for joining two of them. The
record contains ample evidence to this.point.
In the bankrupt proceedings given in evidence by the defendants in the district court, the petitioners state John R. Bedford
to be a resident of the state of Alabama, and the schedule required by law also states him to be of Alabama.
In the record of the proceedings brought lEy J. J. Sigg on the
same note, against Bedford, Breedlove and Robeson, the defend-

JANUARY TERM 1833.
[Breedlove and .Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

apts pled to the jurisdiction of. the court, and alleged m their
plea that John R. Bedford, one -of the members of the firm of
Bedford, Breedlove and'Robeson, was not a citizen of the state
of Louisiana, but is an inhabitant and citizen of the state of
Alabama. The suit was discontinued on the motion of the
plaintiffs' counsel.
It was then fully shown to the court that Bedford could not
have been joined in the action, and it has been repeatedly decided that in chancery, if the court can make a decree according
to justice and equity between the parties before them, that decree shall not be withheld because a party out of its jurisdiction
is not made a defendant, although he must have been united
in the suit had he been within reach of the process of 'the court.
In this case the judgment conforms to right and justice, since
the plaintiffs were entitled to claun the full sum from each of
the defendants.
In a question of doubtful practice, it ought not to be entirely
disregarded, that the defendants in the district court have not
taken this objection, though they pled to the jurisdiction of the
court. 2 Pothier, p. 2, ch. 3, art. 8, no. 270, 271, would seem
to indicate that more than one, and less than all the obligors,
when bound in solido, may be joined in the same suit.
We tlink there was no error m joining two of the defendants
in the same action.
2. The plaimtiff Sigg is denominated in the petition and writ
J. J. Sigg. The omission of his christian name, at full length,
is alleged to be error. He may have had no christian name.
He may have assumed the letters "J. J." as distinguishing him
from other persons of the surname of Sigg. Objections to the
name of the plaintiff cannot be taken advantage of after judgment. If J. J. Sigg was not the person to whom the promise
was made, was not the partner of Theodore Nicolet & Co., advantage should have been taken of it sooner. It is now too late.
3. The petition avers that they are aliens. Tus averment is
not contradicted on the record, and the court cannot presume
that they were citizens.
4. If originally aliens, they did not cease to be so, or lose
their right to sue in the federal court, by a residence in
Louisiana. Neither the constitution nor acts of .congress xe-

SUPREME COURT.
[Breellove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]
quire that aliens should reside abroad to entitle them to sue in
the courts of the United States.
5. The suit not having been brought against Bedford, it
was not necessary to aver or prove that he was subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.
6. The sixth objection is, that the plea to the jurisdiction
was lawfully filed, and ought not to have been taken from the
files of the court.
This plea was, that the firm of Theodore Nicolet & Co.
consisted of other persons in addition to those named in the
writ and petition, and that those other persons were citizens of
Louisiana.
It is admitted that a constitutional or legal disability in the
court to exercise jurisdiction over the parties, may be taken
advantage of by plea m abatement, but they must be parties.
If they are not, the objection is of a different character. In
the case at bar those persons who, if named as plaintiffs, might
have ousted the jurisdiction of the court, were not plaintiffs.
To make them so, was preliminary to any objection to them.
The plea, therefore, was to be considered as objecting to the
writ hnd petition, because all the members of the fim of
Theodore Nicolet &.Co. are not named. The incapacity of
those members to sue, was to be considered after they became
plaintiffs. If persons who ought to join in a suit do not jo in
it, the objection is not to the jurisdiction of the court on account of their invalidity to sue, but because the proper plaintiffs have not all united in the suit. The plea is to be considered as if the averment that Germain Musson and others were
citizens of Lousiana, had not been contained in it.
This plea was offered after issue was joined on a plea in bar,
and the argument of the cause had commenced. The court
might admit it, and the court might also reject it. It was in
the discretion of the court to allow or refuse this additional
plea. As it did not go to the merits of the case, the court
would undoubtedly have acted rightly in rejecting it. But it
was received, and the question is, whether, after its reception,
all power over it was terminated.
All the proceedings are supposed to be within the control of
the court while they are in paper, and before a jury zs sworn or

JANUARY TERM A833.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

a judgment given.

If so, the orders made may be revised, and
such as in the judgment of the court may have been. irregularly or improperly made, may be set aside. If such be the
discretion of the court, this is not a case in which a supervising
tribunal will control that discretion. The court very properly
thought that after issue was joined and the argument commenced, an additional plea not going to the merits, but which
might defeat the action, ought not to have been received. We
are not prepared to say, they exceeded their power in correcting
this order and setting it aside. If they did not exceed their
power, they have committed no error in this exercise of it.
7. The seventh and last error assigned is, that the plaintiffs,
being parties to the insolvent proceedings, were stopped from
questioning the sufficiency of the discharge.
The act of Louisiana, passed on the 20th of February 1817,
section 8, relative to the voluntary surrender of property, and
to the mode of proceeding, &c. directs when the judge shall
be satisfied that the debtor is entitled to the benefit of the act,
"1he shall order that the creditors of said debtor be called in
the manner and within the time prescribed for respites by the
Civil Code, art. 4, title 16i book 3, and he shall appoint a
counsellor to represent the creditors absent or residing out of
the state, if there be any mentioned in the schedule."
The provisin referred to, is in title 18, articles 3052, 3053,
3054, in the volume in possession of the court.
The language of the code is, "the respite is either voluntary
or forced. It is voluritary when all the creditors consent, &c."
"It is forced when a part of the creditors refuse to accept
the debtor's proposal; and when the latter is obliged to compel
them, by judicial authority, to consent to what the others have
determined in the cases directed by law." - The forced respite takes place when the creditors do not all
agree, for then the opinion of the three-fourths, in number and
in amount, prevails over that of the creditors forming the other
fourth, and the judge shall approve such opinion, and it shall
be binding on the other creditors who did not agree to it.
But in order that a-respite may produce that effect, it is necessary,
1. That the debtor should deposit, &c.
VOL. VII.-3 E

SUPREME COURT.
[Breedlove and Robeson v. Nicolet and Sigg.]

2. .That a meeting of the creditors of such debtor, domiciliated in the state, shall be called on a certain day at the office
of a notary public by order of the judge, at which meeting the
creditors shall be summoned to attend, by process issued from
the court, if the creditors live within the parish where the
meeting shall take place, or by letters addressed to them by
the notary, if they are not residing in the parish.
It is further directed that the meeting, as well as its object,
be advertised in English and in French.
It was admitted that this advertisement was made; but it is
not admitted nor proved that the petitioners were summoned
to attend by process from the court, or by letters addressed to
them by the notary. Nor did they appear voluntarily.
Is the judgment binding on them?
It is unquestionable that summary proceedings of this description must be regular, and that their regularity must be
shown by the party who relies on them. Notice to the creditors is material, and the law prescribes that notice and defines
it. Advertisement in the papers is not sufficient. Personal
notice must be given to a resident within the parish, by process,
to a non-resident, by a letter from the notary. The law deems
this notice indispensable, and the court cannot dispense with
it. For want of it the judgment of discharge was no bar to
this action.
There are other irregularities in the proceedings, but want
of notice is fatal, and it is unnecessary to notice them.
Judgment affirmed, with costs and damages, at the rate of
six per cent per annum.
