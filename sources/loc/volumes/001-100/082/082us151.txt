income which he would have received during the extension
of his term of ten years, if it had been extended at its close
for the length of time the quarantines subsisted. The quarantines affected only boats coming up the river, and only such
of those as had cases of fever on board. The quarantines
were established with the consent of the complainant. He
admits this, but says, that although he then made no such
claim, he expected his terh to be extended accordingly. He
knew all about the quarantines when the extension which he
asked for was conceded to him, and when he yielded up the
poÂ§session, saying, he was done with the landing, and claimed
only the proceeds of the tax of $1, which we have already
considered. His right to collect wharfages was neither "interrupted or defeated permanently," nor indeed gainsaid or
questioned by the city.
The claim is neither within the letter, meaning, nor equity
of the contract and must be denied. It appears that Marshall
made two loans from the city to remove incumbrances-one
of $1000. The amount of the other is not shown. Neither
of these loans has been repaid. There is no report of a
master in the record. The decree is very brief. The record
furnishes no means of ascertaining the ground upon which
the court proceeded, in coming to the conclusion that the
complainant was entitled to the sum decreed in his favor.
After a careful examination of the case we have found no
error against the appellant.
DECREE AFFIRMED.

1. Although the formalities prescribed by the 30th section of the act of

law), yet a party may waive any provisions -intended for his benefit.

refrained, at a time when they might be removed and until after possibility of such removal had ceased, from making objections that provisions intended for his benefit were not complied with: and in fact
consent that the deposition should be taken and returned to court as it
was.
Hence if it appear that the witness examined was an aged man when his
deposition was taken; that he had died before the trial; that one of the
counsel of the opposite party had accepted notice of taking the deposition ; that he had attended at the taking, and cross-examined the witness; that he made no objection either to the sufficiency of the oath, to
the reasons for taking the deposition, or to the competency of the magistrate; and that, though the deposition had been filed in the record of
the cause more than a year before the trial, no exception had been taken
to it in all that time, consent to the manner of taking the deposition
must be presumed: and the admission of the deposition in evidence will
be held good even though it may not have been taken in all the modes
prescribed by the act of Congress, to give security to the party against
whom it is meant to be used.
In the case of a deed made by a grantor non-resident of Virginia, it is
sufficient to allow a proper record of it under the Virginia statute of
December 8th, 1792, that there be a certificate of the clerk of a District
Court of the United States that the grantor personally appeared in court
and acknowledged the instrument to be his free act and deed; this being
accompanied by a certificate of even date, by the judge of the same
court, that the clerk was then the officer that he professed to be.
In questions of boundary, reputation in the neighborhood at the present
day is not admissible, unless it be traditionary, or derived from ancient
sources, or from those who had peculiar means of knowing what the
reputation of the boundary was in an ancient day.
A title to land in West Virginia assumed to have been made under the
37th chapter of the Virginia Code relating to sales of land for nonpayment of taxes, which chapter, by the constitution of West Virginia
and otherwise, was part of its laws, and was to remain in force after the
creation of the latter State until repealed by it, was no title at all after
the 27th of February, 1866; the entire said 37th chapter having on that
day been repealed by the legislature of West Virginia.
Where no request is made for specific instructions and no error is perceived in the instructions actually given, the fact that the charge may
not have covered the entire case is not ground for reversal.

ERROR to the District Court for the District of West Virginia:

title originated in a grant made in the year 1787, by the
State of Virginia, to one Jabez Bacon, who subsequently
died leaving eight children, his heirs; among them one
named Nathaniel. The grant to Jabez Bacon embraced
twenty-one tracts of land, including the land now in controversy, and, as the tracts adjoined each other, it was, in substance, a grant of one body containing 20,000 acres, to the
right of Bacon in which the plaintiff asserted that he had
succeeded in virtue of sundry mesne conveyances. But it
was admitted by the plaintiff in the outset of the case that
all the deeds through which hb claimed could not be produced; it being alleged that most of the originals were lost;
several never having been even recorded. Among the instruments which were produced was a certified copy from
the county records of a deed from Nathaniel Bacon (one of
the eight sons of Jabez Bacon, the original grantee of the
Commonwealth), to Philo Murray, of 1815; a like copy of a
deed from Philo Murray to Peter Smith, of 1815; with
original deeds from Gerrit Smith and other heirs of'Peter
Smith to the Oberlin College, of 1853; and from the Oberlin College to Uriah Thompson, of 1854. Assuming the
copies to have been as good evidence as the originals (a
matter denied by the defendant), the apparent defect in the
plaintiff's title here, of course, was that but I of Jabez Bacon's title had been vested in the plaintiff, and this was a
matter which made a great question in the case. To get
over this apparent defect, the plaintiff produced testimony
of one Underwood and others to show that there had formerly existed in the possession of the treasurer of Oberlin
College "twenty patents from the State of Virginia to Jabez
Bacon for the 20,000 acres of land, and of several intermediate deeds by which said land was ultimately conveyed
by Gerrit Smith to Oberlin College; deeds by several men
of the naie of Bacon, and Philo Murray, and Smith." These
deeds, according to the testimony, had been sent by the
treasurer of the college to an agent of it to effect a sale of
part of the lands, which he did, and could not be found.
This evidence was fortified by evidence that the heirs of

SHUTTE

v. THOMPSON.

[Sup. (3t.

Statement of the case.

Jabez Bacon, in conversation about the land, never claimed
any part of it; and that the Smiths from 1815 to 1823, and
Oberlin College till its sale to the plaintiff in 1854, had paid
the taxes; and that the parties paying taxes had unchallenged possession from 1823 till the date of this suit.
The defence was professedly a grant by the State of Virginia prior to that one to Jabez Bacon, and some other
defences, arising under the tax laws of Virginia; but one
great effort ofi the trial was to prevent the plaintiff from
showing a title in himself; without which, of course, he
could not recover in ejectment.
In the coarse of the trial, bills of exception were taken by
the defendant to the admission of certain evidence offered
by the plaintiff, and to the exclusion of certain other evidence offered by himself: and also to the charge of the
court.

The first exception was to the admission by the court of
the deposition of Underwood, already named; taken professedly under the 80th section of the act of Congress of
September 2d, 1789.* This act authorizes the deposition of
an ancient, or any infirm person (among others), to be taken
de bene esse, when the testimony of such person is needed in
any civil cause depending in any district in any court of the
United States. The deposition may be taken before any
justice or judge of any of the courts of the United States, or
before any chancellor, justice, or judge of a supreme or
superior court, mayor or chief magistrate of a city, or judge
of a county court or court of common pleas of any of the
United States, not being of counsel or attorney to either of
the parties, or interested in the event of the cause. The act
further provides for notice to the adverse party, and enacts
that every person deposing as aforesaid shall be carefully
examined and cautioned and sworn or affirmed to testify the
whole truth. It also further enacts that the depositions
taken shall be retained by the magistrate until he deliver
the same with his own hand into the court for which they

are taken, or shall, together with a certificate of the reasons
of their being taken, and of the notice, if any, given to the
adverse party, be by the magistrate sealed up and directed
to the court, and remain under his seal until opened in
court. In the present case the deposition had not been
taken in conformity with these requirements; that is to say,
it did not appear that the witness was sworn to testify the
whole truth. Nor did it appear that there was any certificate
of the reasons why the deposition was takeft. In addition
to this, it was taken before a township justice, and not by
any magistrate described in the act of Congress. And on
these accounts alone the defendant objected to its admission.
The court, however, admitted it. In doing so it assigned as
reasons "that it appeared that the deposition was filed in
the papers of the cause more than one year before the trial
thereof, and that no exceptions had been taken or indorsed
thereon ; that the witness was an aged man when his deposition was taken, and had died before the trial, and that no
exceptions, verbal or otherwise, were taken until the deposition was offered in evidence by the plaintiffs; and because
it further appeared that one of the counsel of the defendant
had accepted notice for taking the deposition, and had appeared at the taking thereof, and cross-examined the witness,
as was shown by the deposition ;" and, as respected the character of the magistrate, "because the court, taking judicial
cognizance of the acts of Assembly of West Virginia (from
which it appears'that a justice is required by law to keep a
record of all his proceedings), and taking further notice of
his power to impanel a jury to try causes before him, and
that appeals will lie from his decisions, upon which transcripts of his record are evidence in the court, was, for these
reasons, of opinion that he is 'a judge of a court within
the meaning of this act of Congress relative to the taking of
depositions de bene esse.'
In the further progress of the trial, the plaintiff offered in
evidence the record of two deeds; one from Nathaniel Bacon
to Philo Murray, and the other from this Murray to Peter
Smith, the grantors in both cases being residents of Connec-

SiaUTTE v. THOMPSON.

ticut, and both deeds being acknowledged in the exact same
way. The defendant objected to the admission of the records,
because it appeared from them that the deeds had not been
acknowledged as deeds made by persons resident out of the
State of Virginia as required by its statutes to be, and because, therefore, the record of them was null.
To understand the force of the objection, it is necessary to
state, that a statute of Virginia, passed December 8th, 1792,
enacts that a de'ed acknowledged by persons residing in any
of the United States, before any court of law, and certified
by the court, shall be admitted to record, a copy of which
shall be evidence.
The acknowledgment was thus in the first of these two
deeds; mutanda mulatis in the second.

In the further progress of the trial, the defendant gave in evidence plats and certificates of thirty-three surveys made in
1785, for one Thomas Laidley, one survey for William Barclay,
one for John Lyne, one for Richard Mason, one for Joshua
Jackson, and five patents to John Reed, the object being to
show the location of the patents. Further, to identify them,

he offered to prove by a witness who had lived many years
in the neighborhood of Thomas Laidley's survey No. 1, that
a poplar corner represented on the plat was, and had been
for many years, known and reported in the neighborhood as
the poplar beginning corner of Laidley's survey. To this
the plaintiffi objected, and the court refused to allow proof
"of the reputation of the neighborhood as to the said poplar
corner at the present day, unless such reputation was traditionary in its character, having passed down from those who
were acquainted with the reputation of the tree from an
early day to the present time," or unless "the information
as to such reputation was derived from ancient sources, or
from persons who had peculiar means of knowing what the
reputation of the tree was at an early day." But the court
permitted the defendant to prove that the occupants of the
Laidley survey No. 1, and of the Mason tract adjoining
thereto (the poplar being a corner of each), claimed the poplar as the true corner of their tracts. To this ruling of the
court the defendant excepted; and this made the fourth bill
of exceptions.
In the further progress of the case, the defendant offered
in evidence a tax deed for the lands from the recorder of
Doddridge County, one Taliaferro Knight, to John S. Hoffman, the purpose of the evidence being apparently to show
title out of the plaintiff. The deed was dated on the 26th of
March, 1866, and showed, by its recitals, that the land was
returned delinquentfor the non-payment of taxes for the year
1857, and was sold in 1860, to Hoffman, in virtue of the 37th
chapter of the Code of Virginia of which West Virginia was
then a part. That chapter allowed two years for redemption, and after their expiration the purchaser was obliged to
have a survey made and reported to the court of the proper
county, which, if approved, the court might order to be
recorded. The clerk was required then to make a deed to
the purchaser, in conformity with the survey. No sale could
be consummated, and no deed could be made prior to the
return, confirmation, and record of such survey. In 1863
West Virginia became a separate State, and by virtue of a

force until changed by the West Virginia legislature. On
the 27th of February, 1866, that legislature passed an act by
which the entire 37th chapter of the Virginia Code was
repealed so far as it applied to tax sales of lands in West
The court rejected the deed offered in evidence, and this
made another of the exceptions.
The trial being closed, the court charged the jury; the
defendant asking no specific instructions on any point, and no instructions being given as to the matter of how far the seveneighths of the title of Jabez Bacon, for which no deeds, or
copies of deeds, were produced, was to be presumed to be
vested in the plaintiff. Verdict and judgment were given
for the plaintiff, and the defendant brought the case here
on error. The case being now in this court, the defendant
in the case below, and now plaintiff iu error here, contended
that the instructions given were insufficient; his point as
expressed in his brief being that they "did not clearly and
correctly expound the law of the case."

The first error assigned is the decision of the court admitting the deposition of Underwood.
It must be admitted that the deposition was not taken in
conformity with all the regulations of the act of Congress
of September 24th, 1789. It does not appear that the witness was sworn to testify the whole truth. N~or does it
appear that there was any certificate of the reasons why
the deposition was taken. In addition to this it was taken
before a township justice, and not by any magistrate described in the act of Congress, and for these reasons the

SHUTTE V. THOM.PSox.
Opinion of the court.

opposition to its reception in evidence was founded. No
other reason was stated in the court below, and no others
are urged in this court.
It is to be observed that the objections made are all
formal rather than substantial. Still they are quite sufficient
to require the rejection of the deposition, if there is nothing
in the case to countervail their effect. But it is obvious that
all the provisions made in the statute respecting notice to
the adverse party, the oath of the witness, the reasons for
taking the deposition, and the rank or character of the
magistrate authorized to take it, were introduced for the
protection of the party against whom the testimony of the
witness is intended to be used. It is not to be doubted that
he may waive them. A party may waive any provision,
either of a contract or of a statute, intended for his benefit.
If, therefore, it appears that the plaintiff in error did waive
his rights under the act of Congress-if he did practically
consent that the deposition should be taken and returned to
the court as it was-and if by his waiver he has misled his
antagonist-if he refrained from making objections known
to him, at a time when they might have been removed, and
until after the possibility of such removal had ceased, he
ought not to be permitted to raise the objections at all. If
he may, he is allowed to avail himself of what is substantially a fraud. Parties to suits at law may-assert their rights
to the fullest extent; but neither a plaintiff nor a defendant

is at liberty to deceive, either actively or passively, his adversary, and a court whose province it is to administer justice,
will take care that on the trial of every cause neither party
shall reap any advantage from his own fraud.
In this case it appeared to the court below, as the record
states, that Underwood was an aged man when his deposition was taken; that he had died before the trial; that one
of the counsel for the defendant (now plaintiff in error) had
accepted notice of taking the deposition; that he had attended at the taking, and cross-examined the witness; that
he made no objection either to the sufficiency of the oath,
to the reasons for taking the deposition, or to the com-

Opinion of the court.

petency of the magistrate; and that, though the deposition
had been filed in the record of the cause more than a year
before the trial, no exception had been taken to it in all that
time. Under these circumstances, the consent of the defendant to the manner of taking the deposition must be
presumed, or a fraudulent attempt to mislead the plaintiff
â¢ must be conceded.

It has been decided that objections to

the competency of a witness must be made at the time of
taking his deposition, if the party objecting attended, and
the objections were then known by him, in order that his
opponent may remove them, and that if he does not then
object he will be presumed to have waived objection.*
The reason is that unless such presumption is made, fraud
and trickery must be imputed to the objecting party. There
is at least equal reason for presuming the consent of the defeudant, that the deposition of Underwood should be taken
before the magistrate who took it, and in the manner in
which it was taken. In York Company v. CeNral Railroad
Company,t it was said that when a deposition has been taken
under a,commission the general rule is, that all objections
of a formal character, and such as might have been urged
on the examination of the witness, must be raised at such
examination, or upon motion to suppress the deposition.
Jn Buddicum v. Kirk,J it appeared that a deposition had been
taken under a "dedinus potestatem." Notice had been given
to the plaintiff's attorney that it would be taken on the 8th
of August, and, if not taken in one day, that the commissioners would adjourn from day to day until it should be
finished. The attorney agreed that it might be taken on
that day whether he attended or not. The commissioners
met on the 8th of August, and adjourned from day to day
until the 12th, when they adjourned until the 19th, and then
took the deposition. There was no attendance of the plaintiff's attorney, and he had no notice of the several adjournments, yet, this court held that the agreement of the attorney
that the deposition might be taken whether he was present

Opinion of the court.

or not, his subsequent examination of it without objecting
to the want of notice, and the death of the witness, were
sufficient grou-nds for the defendant to believe that the objection would be waived, and the deposition was ruled to
be admissible. This, it is true, was not the case of a deposition taken "de bene esse," but it shows that formal errors
and defects in taking depositions may be waived, and it.
shows that much less than appears in the present case will
be held to he sufficient evidence of a waiver. See, also,
Rich v. Lambert,* where it was ruled that the absence of an
order for issuing a commission is waived by joining in executing the commission. In that case the thing waived was
absence of authority to take the deposition.
It must be conceded that the authority to take depositions
de bene esse, under the 30th section of the act or 1789, has
always been construed strictly. Being in derogation of the
rules of common law, the formalities prescribed by the act
must be observed; and many cases may be found in which
such depositions have been rejected, because it did not appear that the required conditions or formalities had been
regarded. They are all, however, cases in which the party
objecting did not attend the examination of the witness, or
took no part in it.. They are all consistent with the rule,
that a party may waive any conditions that are intended for
his sole benefit, and that he does waive every formal objection when he attends the examination of a witness, crossexamines without protest, and remains silent until the witness has died. Such was the case here. The deposition
shows that the attorney of the objectin)g party attended
before the magistrate, that he took part in examining the
witness, a nd that he never made objection until more than
a year afterwards, when the witness was dead, and when
the case came to trial. All these facts appeared to the court
below, and they were not controverted. Under the circumstances, therefore, we think the deposition was correctly
received by the court, and that this assignment of error
cannot be sustained.

SHUTTE

v. ToiuPsox.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

The next error assigned is the admission by the court of
the exemplifications of the record of a deed from Nathaniel
Bacon, a son and heir of Jabez Bacon, to Philo Murray, and
of the record of a deed from Philo Murray to Peter Smith.
It is alleged that the deeds had not been recorded in compliance with the statutes authorizing deeds made out of the
State to be recorded. The objection, we think, is founded
upon a mistake of facts. The grantors were both residents
in the State of Connecticut, and to each deed there was a certificate of the clerk of the District Court of the United States
that the grantor therein named personally appeared in the
court, and acknowledged the instrument to be his free act
and deed. There is also a certificate of the judge, dated the
day of the clerk's certificate, that the clerk was then clerk of
the District Court. Probate was thus made strictly in accordance with the Virginia statute of December 8th, 1792. The
deeds were therefore entitled to record, and they were duly
recorded in pursuance of orders of the county court.* Hence
there was no error in admitting the exemplifications in
evidence.
We pass now to consider the fourth bill of exceptions.
The court refused to allow proof of the reputation of the
neighborhood as to a poplar corner at the present day, "unless such reputation was traditionary in its character, having
passed down from those who were acquainted with the reputation of the tree from an early day to the present time," or
unless "the information as to such reputation was derived
from ancient sources, or from persons who had peculiar
means of knowing what the reputation of the tree was atian
early day." But the court permitted the defendant to prove
that the occupants of the Laidley survey 1o. 1, and of the
Mason tract adjoining thereto (the poplar being a corner of
each), claimed the poplar as the true corner of their tracts.
To this ruling of the court .the defendant excepted.
We do not perceive that any injury could have been sustained by the defendant in consequence of this ruling, even
*.Smith v. Chapman, 10 Grattan, 452; Hassler v. King, 9 Id. 115.

Opinion of the court.

if it was incorrect; certainly none that would justify our
sending the case to a new trial. But there was no error.
Reputation as to the existence of particular facts not of a
public nature, is not generally admissible, though where the
existence of the facts have been proved allnde, reputation is
sometimes received to explai4 them.* Here, however, the
evidence was offered not to explain a fact, but to establish it,
We do not propose to discuss this subject at length. It is
sufficient to say that the limitations imposed by the court
upon the evidence of reputation offered, are fully sustained
by authority.t
The next error of which complaint is made, is that the
court refused to permit the defendant to give in evidence a
tax deed for the lands from Taliaferro Knight, recorder of
Doddridge County, to John S. Hoffman. It seems to have
been offered to show title out of the plaintiff. The deed
bears date on the 26th day of M1arch, 1866. From the recitals
contained in it, we are informed that the land was returned
delinquent for the non-payment of taxes for the year 1857,
and that it was sold in the year 1860, to John S. Hoffman.
The sale was made in force of the laws of Virginia, of which
West Virginia was then a part.1 By that statute two years
were allowed for redemption, and after they had expired, the
purchaser was required to have a survey made and reported
to the court of the proper county, which, if approved, the
court might order to be recorded. After all this had been
done, the clerk was required to make a deed to the purchaser,
in conformity with the survey. No sale could be consummated, and no deed could be made, prior to the return, confirmation, and record of such survey. It is important to keep
these provisions of the law in mind, for in 1863 West-Virginia became a separate State. By virtue of a clause in its
constitution, as well as without such ordinance, the laws of
Virginia continued in force until changed by the West Vir1 Greenleaf on Evidence, 138.

ginia legislature. B*ut that legislature, on the 27th of February, 1866, passed an act by which the entire thirty-seventh
chapter of the Virginia statutes was repealed so far as it
applied to tax sales of lands in West Virginia.* At that time
the deed to Hoffman had not beeP made, nor had the survey
of the land been made and reported. This appears from the
deed itself. It is plain, therefore, that there was no authority
for the survey and report, or for the deed. Without the
statute in existence when they were made, they could have.
no efficacy. As transmissions of title they were wholly void.
The deed was therefore properly rejected.
There remains one more exception to be considered. It
is to the charge of the court in answer to the request of the
jury for instructions. It is, however, unnecessary to examine
critically the charge. If we understand the complaint of the
plaintiff in error, it is not so much that erroneous instructions were given, as that the court failed to give the directions which it is now contended should have been given.
The point made in the brief of the plaintiff in error is, that
"the instructions given to the jury by the court, did not
clearly and correctly propound the law of the case." There
were, however, no requests for specific instruction, and it is
abundantly settled that error cannot be assigned for failure
to give instructions that were not asked. The portion of
the charge excepted to, may not have covered the whole
case. It probably did not. But so far as given, we discover
in it no erroneous directions. It is true that, under the
statutes of the State, the claimant, in order to take the forfeited title, must have had an apparent title, or color of title,
regularly derived from the Commonwealth, acquired legitimately, and must have discharged the State's lien for taxes.
This does not seem to have been contested. It certainly
was not denied by the court. The main controversy evidently was over the question whether the whole title of
Jabez Bacon has become vested in the plaintiff. A deed
from only one of his children appears to have been given in

evidence. But the loss of many title papers was proved.
The heirs of Bacon made no claim, and disclaimed all intention of claiming. The plaintiff, and those under whom he
claimed, had taken charge of the land, and kept it from 1815
till 1839, paying taxes. Then all the heirs of Smith quitclaimed to the Oberlin Collegiate Institute, whose title the
plaintiff has. From 1826, possession has attended the claim,
without challenge. Whether these facts, and others of which
.evidence was given, justified a presumption of a grant from
the other heirs of Bacon was, of course, a question for the
jury, in regard to which no instruction to the jury was
asked. Nor are we informed what directions, if any, were
given. In this part of the case there is, consequently nothing for us to review. And in the part of the charge to which
exception was taken, we perceive no error.

was abusing his trust, and applying the money lent to his own purposes.
2. The lender will be held to have had this notice when the certificates of
the stocks pledged show on their face that the stock is held in trust, and
when, apparently, the loan was for a private purpose of the trustee, and
this fact would have been revealed by an inquiry.
3. The duty of inquiry is imposed on a lender lending on stocks, where the
certificate of them reveals a trust.
4. These principles are not affected by the fact that the stocks pledged may
be such as the trustee under the instrument creating his trust had no
right to invest in; as ex. gr., stock of a canal company, when he was
bound to invest in State or Federal loans.
5. Notice to the cashier of a bank, or of bankers, that the stock pledged is
trust stock, is notice to them.
