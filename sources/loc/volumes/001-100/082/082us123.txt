It would be extending the liabilities of obligors on

such bonds beyond principle and precedent to hold them
responsible for the reimbursement of moneys paid by government to its own officers or agents, because, subsequent
to their payment, government declares that such reimbursement shall be made.
This case is distinguished from that of UMited States v.
Powell, decided at the last term.: There the moneys were
expended by the United States, and one of the bonds in
suit was executed, after the passage of the joint resolution.
It follows from these views that the ruling of the court
below in sustaining the demurrer of the defendants to the
second count of the declaration was correct.
JUDGMENT REVERSED, and the cause REMANDED PoR. FURTHER PROCEEDINGS, with leave to the defendants to plead

anew to the first count of the declaration.
NOTE.-At the same time, and in a similar way with the preceding case,
was adjudged the case of United States v. Van Buskirk, in which the same
points arose as in United States v. Singer.

HEDRICK V. HUGHES.
1. The act of Congress of March 6th, 1820, admitting Missouri into the
Union, and the act of March 8d, 1823, respecting grants of land to that
State, without further grant or patent, vested in the State the 16th section of each township for school purposes; but where this section had
been sold or disposed of by the government, it required the selection of
other lands in lieu thereof by the register and receiver of the proper
land district, and such selection when made and entered in the register's
books, vested the title of such substituted lands in the State.
2. In such case, where the register's book, or the leaf supposed to contain
the entry, is lost or destroyed, the fact of such selection may be proved
by other evidence,-as, that the lands claimed to have been so selected
had been treated and sold as school lands by the proper State authorities

near to the period when the selection should have been made; also, that
the original township plat kept in the register's office had a memoran'
dum on the lot in question that it was " reserved for schools."
8. Where a county school commissioner in Missouri kept in a book a record
of his transactions in selling the school lands in the county, which was
deposited in the county clerk's office, and preserved as a public monument among the county archives, it is de facto a public record, and
proper evidence of his official acts. It is also admissible as the entries
of a deceased person, made in the course of his official duty, in a matter
of public concern, to prove his official transactions.
4. If a township plat be lost or destroyed, it may be proved by a copy; and
memoranda on such copy, not contained in the original, if accounted for
and explained, will not exclude the copy as evidence of the contents of
the original, even though such memoranda be a translation of corresponding memoranda in the original.
ERROR

to the Circuit Court for the District of Missouri.

Messrs. Montgomery Blair and F. A. Dick, for the plain iff in
error; Mr. T. T. Gantt, contra.
Mr. Justice BRADLEY stated the case, and delivered the
opinion of the court.
This was an action of ejectment brought by the plaintif
in error to recover a certain quarter section of land in Howard County, Missouri. The plaintiff claimed the land under
a patent of the United States, granted to one Widdicombe,
June 1st, 1868, upon a scrip certificate issued to the State of
Kentucky, under the act of July 2d, 1862, donating lands to
the several States for the support of agricultural colleges.
The defendant, who had been in possession of the land for
more than thirty years, and had erected expensive improvements on it, claimed title under a grant from the State of
Missouri, made in 1832. The title of the State was derived
in the following manner. By the 6th section of the act of
Congress, passed March 6th, 1820,* entitled, " An act to
authorize the people of the Missouri Territory to form a constitution and State government, &c.," it was, amongst other
things, proposed for the acceptance of the convention, and,

HUGHES.

Statement, in the opinion, of the first point of the case.

if accepted, to be binding on the United States, that "section sixteen," in every township, and when such section had
been sold, or otherwise disposed of, other lands equivalent
thereto, and as contiguous as might be, should be granted to
the State for the use of the inhabitants of the township for
the use of schools; also, all salt springs, not exceeding
twelve in number, and six sections of land contiguous to
each, for the use of the State, with other concessions stated
in the act. These proposals were accepted by the convention. For the purpose of carrying out this grant as to school
lands, an act was passed on the 3d of Mlarch, 1823,* by
which it w~s enacted that in all cases in which "section
sixteen" had been sold or otherwise disposed of, it should
be the duty of the register and receiver of the respective
land offices in whose districts such land might be, to select
the like quantity of other lands equivalent thereto, from any
of the unappropriated lands of the United States in that
State, as nearly contiguous to said "section sixteen" as
might be; and a descriptive entry of'such selected lands
should be made on "the books of the register, specifying as
well the township in which, as that for the use of which, the
selection should be made; and the lands thus selected and
located were, by the act, granted to the State, for the use
of the inhabitants of the respective townships for the use
of schools, instead of the sixteenth section so sold or disposed of.
The defendant insisted that section sixteen, i'n the township in which the lot in question was situated, had been sold
by the United States prior to March 6th, 1820; that the
register and receiver of the land district had selected other
lands for the use of the township for school purposes unde"
the act of 1823, and had made a descriptive entry thereof
in the register's books in pursuance of the act; and that
the quarter section in question (which was a part of section
seventeen) was one of the tracts so selected, and thereby
became the property of the State, and had been sold as such
* 3 Stat. at Large, 787.

by the school commissioner of the county in 1832; and that
a patent had been duly granted by the State in pursuance
of such sale, under which the title of the defendant was
regularly derived.
All the parts of this defence were duly proved except one.
This was the selection and entry of the lot in question by
the register and receiver, in lieu of "section sixteen," disposed of. The register's book contained no descriptive
entry as directed by the act. The leaf that should have contained it (if it was made) being missing; and the original
township plat (which would probably have indicated the
fact) being also lost.
This hiatus in his case the defendant endeavored to supply by proof aliunde. He adduced the testimony of several
witnesses to show that the lot in question had been rented
out as school lands for several years prior to 1832, and that
in that year it was sold, with other school lands, by Owen
Rawlins, the county school commissioner, being the sale
upon which the State patent was based. He then produced
and offered in evidence from the county archives, kept in
the clerk's office, a certain book or record, kept by Rawlins,
containing a copy of his commission as school commissioner,
and a history of his proceedings in selling the school lands;
together with a list, in the handwriting of one Boon, of all
the school lands of the county, including the lot in question;
which entries were made in 1831-2, and both Rawlins and
Boon were shown to have been dead many years. The defendant also produced a book purporting to contain a copy
of the original township plats in the register's office (including the township in question), showing the various sections of
land, and memoranda written on each section as to the disposition thereof, in which the quarter section in question had
the words "reserved for schools" written upon it. As to
the origin of this book James L. McNair testified that it was
made by him in 1853; that he was then deputy clerk of
Howard County; that he had before that time been clerk
in the office of the register whilst his father held that office;
that an act of the Missouri legislature directed the county

clerk to procure a copy of the township plats in the register's office; and that the witness was employed by Mr.
Harding, the then clerk of the county court, and by Judge
Todd, then register of the land office, to make the copy;
that he made it carefully, and was satisfied that the book
produced was a true copy-not, however, a literal copy of
any one book then in the register's office, in all particulars.
As to entries, the plat-book in the register's office would
contain on any particular subdivision of land the letters
"A.," "P.," with a number; on another book would be
seen the name corresponding to this number; and, in compiling this copy, the witness would. write down the name
instead of the number-thus translating it, and condensing
two books into one. The letters "A.," "P." signified that
the tract had been applied for and paid for. In respect of
reservations for schools, the words, "reserved for schools,"
were written on the original plats in the register's office on
the tracts so reserved. The writing on the'plat of the township in question was all in the witness's handvriting as he
made it in 1853. Herndon, who was for more than twentyfive years clerk of Howard County, corroborated _cNair's
testimony.
Upon this proof the defendant offered in evidence the
said record of Owen Rawlins, and the copy of the plat of
the township in question in the book made by McNair; and
the court, against the objections of the plaintiff, admitted
them in evidence; to which ruling the plaintiff excepted.
This is the first error assigned; and we have no hesitation
in saying that the evidence was properly admitted. The
book of Rawlins was de facto a county record, preserved as
a public monument in the county archives. For the purpose of showing his acts as school commissioner in selling
the land in question as school lands, it was undoubted evidence. It was such, not only as a public record, but as the
entry of a deceased person made in the course of his official
duty, in a matter of public concern, which clearly made it
evidence of his public transactions. The list made by Boon

[Sup. Ct.

Statement, in the opinion, of the second point of the case

was evidently a part of the same record made under Raw]ins's direction, and was admissible on the same grounds.
The plat made by McNair was competent secondary evidence of the contents of the original plat w~Iich was lost.
The fact that it did not correspond in every particular with
that original in respect of the memoranda written upon it,
did not detract from its admissibility. Those memoranda,
and the manner in which they were made, were sufficiently
explained.
As to the bearing of this evidence upon the issues of the
cause, it is sufficient at this point to say, that in view of the
fact that the proper evidence with regad to the action of
the register aid receiver was entirely lost or destroyed, the
fact that the land in question had been publicly treated and
disposed of by the county authorities as school lands so near
to the time when such lands were set apart for school purposes, had an important bearing on the question whether
the register and receiver did, in fact, make the selection of
the lot in question. We think that it was proper evidence
to go to a jury on such a question. Without other corroborative circumstances, it might have had but slight weight.
But on the principle involved in the maxim " onda presumuntur gile esse aeta," as applied to the acts of public officers,
we think it was clearly competent.
The bearing of the township plat will be discussed hereafter.
To rebut this defence the plaintiff offered evidence to
show that neither the local land office nor the General Land
Office at Washington contained any evidence whatever of
the alleged selection of the lot in question as school lands,
but that the only memorandum with regard to that lot was
of the sale to Widdicombe, under which the plaintiff claimed
title.
The plaintiff then called upon the court to declare, as law,
that the United States did not part with its title to the land
in question prior to the issuing of the patent to Widdicombe; and that neither the act of Congress of March 6th,

1820, admitting Missouri into the Union, nor any subsequent act, operated as a grant per se to the State, or to any
of the inhabitants thereof, of the lot in question; but that
to divest the title of the United States, the lot should have
been designated and set apart according to law, in lieu of a
similar quantity of the sixteenth section sold or disposed of by
the government prior to March 6th, 1820, and that no such
designation or setting apart had been shown by the evidence. This was, in substance, asking the court to decide
against the validity of the defence. The court refused so
to declare, but on the contrary, at the request of the defendant, in substance, declared the law to be, that if, in fact,
prior to 6th March, 1820, section sixteen had been disposed
of and sold by the United States, and if the register and receiver of the proper land office, under the act of 1823, in
lieu thereof, did reserve and select the lot in question, and
did make a descriptive entry of said reservation and selection, which entry had been lost or destroyed by the loss of
the leaf on which it was made, the claim of the plaintiff
under the State of Missouri was valid.
To these rulings exceptions were taken.
It is certainly true that neither the act of 1820, nor that
of 1823, of themselves, transferred the title of the lot in
question from the government to the State of Missouri. The
sixteenth section of land having been disposed of, it required
a designation of some other lands, in the manner pointed
out by the statute, to take its place. Until such designation
was made it is evident no title could pass. But such designation and entry were all that the law required to be done.
No patent was necessary fbr the substituted lots any more
than for the sixteenth section itself, had that been undisposed of. The things to be done in order to vest title in
the State were certain acts of the register and receiver. The
essential thing was the selection of the land. The evidence
of it, as prescribed by the statute, was the descriptive entry
to be made in the register's book. If the essential thing
were done the destruction of the evidence would not deVoL. XV.

stroy the title. The primary proof of the act done would,
of course, be the record itself. That being lost or destroyed,
the acts of the register and receiver could be substantiated
by the next best evidence which the case admitted of. The
question before us is whether the evidence adduced and received by the court was conducive to prove the fact, and was
the next best evidence to be had on the subject.
In our judgment it was both. INo record evidence of the
fact in question was required except the entry in the register's book. The evidence adduced was, first, the plat of the
township so carefully compiled by Mc~air. This showed
that the lot in question was designated as "reserved for
schools." This designation was copied from the original
plat in the register's 9ffice. Here then was evidence of the
most convincing character that the lot in question had been
designated by the register and receiver as school lands.
Here was a collateral and contemporaneous record containing evidence of the very fact respecting the existence or
non-existence of which the parties and the court were in
search. It was not, it is true, the primary proof required by
the statute, but it was independent proof of the essential
fact in issue, and was sufficient proof to raise the presumption that if those missing leaves could be produced the primary proof would be found thereon. It was not so satisfactory as a literal compared copy of those leaves, but more
satisfactory than oral testimony depending on human memory as to their contents. The books are full of cases to the
effect that if a judgment record, or other record, be lost, the
judgment or other matter may be proved by collateral entries and memoranda. But, secondly, we have the corroborative evidence derived from the acts of the county school
commissioner in selling the lands as school lands, as far back
as 1832, and the renting of them as such even before that
time, and the defendant's possession and claim of title of
the land as reserved school lands for more than thirty years,
all going to strengthen the other proof and presumptions in
the case.
It ,would be strange, indeed, if men's possessions could be

disturbed by the burning of a court-house, or the loss, destruction, or theft of a public record-, when evidence, such
as was adduced in this case, could be supplied to show that
the acts upon which their titles depended had been duly
performed by the proper public officers. And courts would
be derelict in their duty to the community if they did not
sternly rebuke speculative attempts to rob people of their
just inheritances under such circumstances. Mere lapse of
time and continuance of possession without pretence of title,
or under pretence of a void title, cannot, it is true, be set
up against the government; but long possession is, nevertheless, a strong weapon of defence in the hands of one who
can show reasonable proof that the title of the government
has been parted with, and has devolved to him.
As to the sufficiency of the evidence adduced in this case,
it is not the part of this court, on a writ of error, to pronounce. That was the province of the court below sitting
as a jury. That court determined it to be sufficient, and
found the issue for the defendant. We think that the evidence was admissible, that it was pertinent to the issue, and
tended to prove that issue on the part of the defendant, and
that the law of the case, as declared by the court, was correct.
