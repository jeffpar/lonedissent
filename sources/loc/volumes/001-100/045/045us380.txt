JAMES STIMPSON, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, v. THE WEST CHESTER RAILROAD ComPA-N,

DEFENDANTS.

The practice of excepting, generally, to a charge of the court to the jury, without
setting out, specifeally, the points excepted to, censured. The writ of error not
dismissed, only on account of the peculiar circumstAnces of the case.
Where a defective patent had been surrendered, and a-new one taken out, and the
patentee brought an action for a violation of his patent right, laying the infringement at a date subsequent to that of the renewedpatent, proof of the use of te
thing patented during the interval between the original and renewed patents will
not defeat the action.
The seventh section of the act of March 3, 1839, has exclusive reference to an
original application for a patent, and not to a renewal of it.
An original patent being destroyed by the burning of the patent-office, and the
only record of the specifications being a publication in the Franklin Journal,
the claim is not limited by that publication, because the whole of the specifications are not set forth in it.
Whether a renewed patent, after a surrender of a defective one, is substantially for
a different invention, is a question for the jury, and not for the court.
As the thirteenth section of the act of 1836 provides for the renewal of a patent,
where it shall be "inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective or insufficient
description or specification," "irfthe error shall have arisen by inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention," the fact
of the granting of the renewed patent closes all inquiry into the existence of inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and leaves open only the question of fraud for
the jury.

THis case was brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for East Pennslyvania.
It was a suit brought, in the Circuit Court, by Stimpson
right. against
the Railroad Company, for a violati6n of his patent
On the 23d of August, 1831, Stimpson took out letters patent for
an improvement in the mode of turning short curves on railroads.
These letters were not given in evidence upon the trial, having
been burned in the conflagration of the patent-office, in December,
1836, and no copy could be found. Secondary evidenced was
given of their contents by the following publication in the Franklin
Journal.

".For an improvement in the mode of turning short curves on railroads, such as the comers of streets ; James Stimpson, city of
Baltimore, August 23.
"37. The plan proposed is to make the extreme edges of the
flanches flat, and of greater width than ordinary, and to construct
the rails in such a manner that where a short turn is to be made,
-the extreme edge of the flaneh shall rest upon it, instead of upon
the tread of the wheel, thus increasing the effective diameter of the
wheel in a; degree equal to twice the projection of the flanch. The
claim is made to ' the application of the flanches of railroad carriage-wheels to turn short curvatures upon railroads or tracks, particularly turning the comers of streets, wharves, crossing of tracks
or roads, and passing over turnabouts,' &c." Frgnklin Journal,
vol. 9. p. 124.

Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

On turning to pages 270 and 271, vol. 4, there will be found
specifications of two patents granted to James Wright, of Columbia,
Pennsylvania, for the mode of turning curves claimed by i\Ir.
Stimpson. The only difference is, that Mr. Wright proposes to
adapt his cars to several different curves by having three or more
offsets in his wheels when necessary.
On the same day, namely, the 23d of August, 1831, Stimpson
took out, also, letters pateht for an improvement in the mode of
forming and using cast or wrought-iron plates or rails, for railroad
carriage-wheels to run upon. These letters being also destroyed,
the following extract from the Franklin Journal was given in evidence.
Franklin Journal, vol. 9, p. 125. " 39. For an improvement
in the mode 6f forming and using cast or wrought-iron plates, or
rails, for railroadcarriage-wheelsto run upon; James Stimpson,
tity of Baltimore, Maryland, August 23 (1831).
" The claim in this case is to ' the application of cast or wroughtiron plates for the use of railways on the streets or wharves of cities
or elsewhere. The objects of said improvement being to employ
rails that will not present any obstacles to the ordinary use of streets,
or sustain injury therefrom, and so to form the plates at the intersections of streets or other crossings, that cars will readily pass
over them, and also on circles of small radius.'
" The rails are to be formed with a groove in'them to receive the
flanches of the wheels ; on one side of the groove, the width is to
be sufficient for the tread of the wheel, on the other, it need not
exceed three quarters of an inch. These rails are to be laid flush
with the pavement of the streets. At comers to be turned, the
rails are to be cast, or made of the proper curvature, one of them"
only being provided with a groove,' as the flanch is to run upon the
other, upon the principle described in No. 37. Provision is to be
made by scrapers, or brushes, preceding the carriages, to clear the
grooves of dust, ice, and other obstructions."
In 1835, the first mentioned of these letters, namely, for an
" improvement in the mode of turning short curves on railroads,"
were surrendered on account of a defective specification, and on
the 26th of September, 1835, a renewed patent was issued for the
term of fourteen yearsd from the 23d of August, 1831. The
schedule referred to in this patent was as follows.
" Short Curves.
"23d August, 1831. - Renewed 26th September, ,1835.
"To all whom these presents shall come : Be it known, that I,
James Stimpson, of the city and county of Baltimore and State of
Maryland, have invented a new and useful improvement in the
mode of turning short curves upon railroads with railroad carriages,
particularly those round the corners of streets, wharves, &c., and

that the following is a full and exact description of said invention or
improvement, as invented or improved by me, namely :-I use or
apply the common peripheries of the flanches of the wheels for the
aforesaid purpose, in the following manner : I lay a flat rail, which,
however, may be giooved, if preferred, at the commencement of the
curvation, and in a position to be centrally under the flanches of the
wheels upon the outer track of the circle, so that no other part of
the wheels which run upon the outer circle of the track rails shall
touch or bear upon the rails, but the peripheries of the flanches ;
they bearing the whole weight of the load and carriage, while the
opposite wheels, which run upon the inner track of the circle, are to
be run and bear upon their treads in the usual way, and their
flanches run freely in a groove or channel ; which treads are ordinarily about three inches in diameter less than the peripheries of the
flanches.
"Were the bearing surfaces of the wheels which are in contact
with the rails while thus turning the curve to be connected by
straight lines from every point, there would thus be formed the frustrums of two cones (if there be four wheels and two axles to the
carriage), or if but one axle and two wheels then but one cone ;
which frustrums, or the weeels representing their extremities, will,
if the wheels are thirty inches in diameter, and are coupled about
three feet six inches apart, turn a curve of about sixty feet radius
of the inner track rail. The difference in diameter between the
flanches and treads before stated, the tracks of the usual width, and
the wheels coupled as stated, would turn a curve of a somewhat
smaller radius, if the axles were not confined to the carriage in a
parallel position with each other ; but this being generally deemed
necessary, the vheels run upon lines of tangents, and these upon
the inner track being as-wide apart in the coupling as the outer ones,
keep constantly inclining the carriage outwards, and thus cause the
carriage to tend to run upon a larger circle than the difference in
diameter of the treads and flanches would otherwise give ; but the
depth of the flanches and the couplings may be so varied as to turn
any other radius of a circle desired.
" What I claim as my invention or improvement is the application of the flanches on the wheels on one side of railroad carriages,
and of the treads of the wheels on the other side, to turn curves
upon railways, particularly such as turning the comers of streets,
wharves, &c., in cities and elsewhere, operating upon the principle
herein set forth.

"Witnesses, - JA.ss H. STIBPsoN,

In October, 1840, Stimpson brought his action against the

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

383

Stimpson r. West Chester Railroad Company.

West Chester Railroad Company for a violation of this renewed
patent, and laid the infringement to have taken place in 1839.
In April, 1842, the case came on for trial.
The plaintiff produced his patent, and gave evidence that the defendants had used upon their road several curves of this description.
The defendants disputed the originality of the invention of the thing
patented, under which head of defence much evidence was given;
and also contended that the groove was not claimed in the first
patent of 1831, and therefore was not included in the renewed
patent of 1835. The evidence of Dr. Jones upon this last head
being referred to by the court below, it is proper to insert that
part of it.
"Interrogatoryfifth. What are the contents of the specification
of the alleged improvement of August 23, 1831 ? What are
your means of knowing what were their contents ? If you know
them, are they dissimilar or similar to those of the plaintiff's specification of September 26, 1835, a copy of which, marked A, is
hereto annexed ? If dissimilar, state in what particulars, and
whether they are as to matters of form and substance, and particularly describe the difference, if any. Answer fully."
"To the fifth interrogatory, I answer, that the plgintiff exhibited to me the specification in question, previously to his filing the
same in the Patent Office ; as he likewise did at the same'time the
specification of a patent for I forming and using ,vast-ironplates or
rails for railroad carriage-wheels to run upon,' which last patent is
noticed on page 125, vol. 9, second series, of the Journal of the
Franklin Institute. "I then examined them cursorily, and expressed an opinion, that the improvements described in the two specifications might have been embraced in one, and that it would have
been better to have pursued that course. The specification of the
mode of turning short curves appeared to me incomplete ; an essential feature of it being contained in that for ' forming and using
cast-iron plates,' &c.
The papers, hzwever, remained as drawn up
by Mr. Stimpson's legal adviser, and when the patents were subsequently surrendered in 1835, it was thought best to preserve the
division into two ; it was probably in fact necessary to pursue this
course, as I am not aware of any precedent for uniting two patents
into one, although one may be divided into two :or more.
" Nearly ten years have elapsed since I first saw the specifications upon which these patents were first issued, and nearly six
years since I last read them ; End my recollection of them extends
to certain prominent points only. The -laim under the patent for
turning short curves, as given in vol. 9, p. 124, of my Journal is, I
have no doubt, literally correct. There has been an omission in
the printing of inverted commas ["1] after the word I turnabout,'
&c, In this specification it was proposed to make the extreme

edges of the flanches flat, and of greater width than ordinary ; this,
however, did not enter into the claim, and it is not probable that I
should have recollected the fact, had it not been noted in my Journal, or called up by some other collateral circumstance. The main
defect, in my judgment, of the original specification, in the patent for
turning short curves, was the omission of the mention of the groove
in the inner rail. I believe, however, that it was alluded to in this
specification, but the description of it was contained principally, if
not wholly, in the specification of the patent for ' forming and
using cast-iron on wrought plates,' &c., above noticed; as may be
inferred from a reference to my Journal, vol. 9, p. 125, patent 39.
" Cross Interrogatories. 1. Did you or did you not prepare
the papers of the plaintiff when his patent for short curves was surrendered and renewed ? What was the object -of such surrender
and renewal ? Was it or was it not that the claim of running over
or across tracks at right angles might not continue any longer to be
incorporated in the same patent with the claims for short curves, as
it had.been theretofore ?
"To the first cross interrogatory, I answer, that I did prepare
the papers of the plai itiff when his patent for turning short
'curves was surrendered for reissue ; that the object of such surrender and renewal was to limit and confine it to the turning short
curves in streets, &c., by leaving out certain matters in it respecting the crossing of tracks or roads, and the passng over turnabouts ;
and to define the subject-matter of the patent more clearly, without
its being necessary to refer to that simultaneously obtained for
'forming and using cast or wrought-iron plates,' &c."
The bill of exceptions' taken by the plaintiff was to the following part of the charge of the court to the jury, namely: "Having thus presented you with a view of the rules and principles of the common law applicable to the renewal of patents, as
laid down by the Supreme Court, together with the provisions of
the different acts of Congress on this subject, we will .now state to
you what is, in our opinion, their legal result.
"To authorize the surrender of an old patent and issue of a new
one, consistently with the provisions of the original patent law of
1793, and the decisions Qf the Supreme Court, independently of
any act of Congress conferring such power, there are these requisites indispensable to the power-arising. (1.) The original patent
must be inoperative or invalid for the causes set forth in the act of
1832, - the non-compliance with the third section of the act of
1793, for the wat of a proper specification of the thing patented,
through inadvertence, accident, or mistake, without any fraudulent
or deceptive intention. This being the only case embraced in the
law to which the authority conferred applies. (2.) 1, The defect
in the specification, which makes it incompetent to secure the
rights of the patentee, must have arisen from inadvertence, acci-

dent, or mistake, and 2, not from any fraud or ihisconduct. The
reissue of the patent by the appropriate officer is presumptive
evidence that the requisites of the law have been complied with,
on the production of such evidence or proof otherwise as justified
it ; but the question of the validity of the new patent is a judicial
one, depending on the fact of inadvertefce or fraud, as you shall
find it; and the opinion of the court on mtters of law involved in
the inquiry. 14 Peters, 458 ; 6 Peters, 243 ; 7 Peters, 321 ;
Act of 1839 (5 Lit. & Brown's ed. 353). The reason why
there must be an inquiry into both the inadvertence and fraud
arises from the settled construction of the act of 1793, that where
the defect is not owing to fraud, the defendant is entitled to a verdict and judgment in his favor, but not to a judgment that the
patent is void for the defect, -unless he shbws that the defect was
owing to fraud. 1 Bald. ; 6 Peters, 246. You must then be
.satisfied, affirmatively, that the defect of the patent arose from the
inadvertence of the patentee, and negatively, that it did not arise
from his fraud~ or misconduct, or, in the words of the acts of 1832
and 1836, ' without any fraudulent or deceptive intention.' The
finding the fact of inadvertence may negative the fact of fraud,
but in this, as in other cases, fraud may be inferred from gross inadvertence or negligence, such as may be the indication of a design to deceive the public. The defects in the old patent must be
in the specification, when it does not comply with the requisites of
the third section of the act of 1793, calling for a correct description of the thing patented (6 P.eters, 247); a new one may be
issued on compliance with those requisites, which are there prescribed. But the new patent must be confined to the thing patented by the old one, -the thing invented cr discovered, - I the same
invention1); it cannot embrace anoiher substantive and essential
matter, which was not before patented ; the thing, the invention,
must be-the same in both patents ; the only object in the renewal
being to cure a defect in the description, not to supply the omission
of an essential part of the invention ; the new patent cannot be
broader than the old one. If the thing patented is the same in
both patents, its public use did not, under the former laws, amount
to an 'abandonment, or such an acquiescence as to affect the new
patent on the ground of delay or negligence in the assertion of the
right of the patentee, from the date of the old patent to its reissue. But when an essential part is omitted, and the patentee
suffers -it to remain unpatented till it has come into public use,
before the new patent issues, it will be subject to the same rules
which apply to an original patent, making it incompetent to protect the patentee in his claim to such part in virtue of the patent
reissued, if it was not described in the one surrendered. The
thirteenth section of the act of 1836 authorizes a new improvement, invented since the first patent, to be added in a renewed
voL. Iv.

Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

one ; no law gives any authority to add an improvement, which
had been invented by the patentee before the original grant ; for it
is not and cannot be any part of the description or specification of
another distinct improvement. A patent for the combination of
the parts of an old machine must show wherein such combination exists ; what parts compose it ; how they are combined in
their action ; if the description is defective, it may be corrected
by a new one ; the correction, however, must not extend beyond
the combination of the parts first specified, as the introduction of
other parts, not before specified, makes an entire new combination;
consequently the thing patented becomes essentially different, being
not the same invention, but a new one, made by a combination of
a parL not combined before, which might be a proper subject of an
original patent, yet would not be authorized in a renewed one.
"These are the tests which the law applies to the description of
the thing patented, in order to ascertain whether, in the words of
the act of 1832, the old patent was I invalid or inoperative' by
reason that the conditions of the former law not having been complied with, or, in the language of the Supreme Court, the patent
' is found to be incompetent to secure the reward which the law
intended to confer on the patentee for his invention.' In such
case, the patent may be surrendered for reissue, in order to correct the defects which invalidated the first, but the law expressly
makes the new patent ' in all respects liable to the same matter
of objection and defence' as the old one, and imposes on the
patentee the obligation I of compliance with the terms and conditions prescribed by the third section of the act of 1793.' This
is done by showing, according to its requisitions, what was the invention, the thing patented, by a designation of the invention principally,, made in fuller- clearer, and more exact terms than those
used, so as to give it validity and effect, and secure the same invention, which is the only legitimate office of the renewed or reissued patent. A specification consists of two parts, - description and claim ; the descriptive part is the explanation of the improvement in all the particulars required by the law; the claim or
summary, at the close of the description or specification, is the
declaration of the patentee of what he claims as his invention, by
which he is bound, so that he can claim nothing which is not included in the. summary, and could disclaim nothing which was included in-it till the passage of the act of 1837. But the summary
may be referred to the description, and both will be liberally construed to ascertain what was claimed, and if the words will admit
of it, both parts will be connected in order to carry into effect the
true intention of the patentee, as it may appear on a judicial inspection of the whole specification. This makes it a question of
law what is the thing patented, depending not on the actual or
supposed intention of the patentee, but.the conclusion of the law

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

387

Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

on the language he has used to express it ; a part of the description may be construed as a claim, and carried into the summary,
and made a part of the thing patented, the effect of which is the
same as if it was included in the summary in express terms.
Cooper v. Matheys, C. C. MSS. To authorize a recovery for
the violation of a patent right, the plaintiff must show that he is
the inventer of every thing he claims as new, that it is embraced
in the patent, and that every thing so claimed and patented has
been infringed by the defendant ; thus, where the patedt is for a
particular combination of the parts of an old machine, and the defendant has not used the whole combination as specified in the
description, and carried into the summary, the plaintiff cannot recover. Prouty ei al. v. Ruggles, 16 Peters, 336."
The court then proceeded to state the substance of the plaintiif's'declaration, and referred to the patent of 1835, and the specification thereto attached, in order to ascertain the thing patented
by that patent which was stated therefrom ; they then inquired
what was the thing patented in 1831, by referring to the evidence
of Thomas P. Jones, contained in the deposition aforesaid, in
connection with the Journal of the Franklin Institute referred to
by him. The court, remarking that there being in evidence no
copy of the patent of 1831, any drawing or specification of the
thing patented, or other ploof of the contents of either than was
contained in the deposition and Journal aforesaid, then gave their
opinion to the jury, that, on this evidence, the use of grooves was
not claimed, and was no part of the thing patented in 1831 for
turning shoit curves, but was a part of the thing patented in 1835.
That it was an essential part of this invention, *s Jones testified,
and without which all the witnesses agreed that the invention was
useless ; as without the groove the cars would run off the road,
and that the patent was not for any parts of the machine which
were new, but for a new combination of the old parts. It was
then submitted to the jury, whether, on the evidence aforesaid, the
omission of the groove in the patent of 1831 arose from inadvertence, and if it was done contrary to the advice of Jones, and in
conformity with the opinion of the legal adviser of the plaintiff,
and whether, without the groove, the description of the thing
patented .was sufficient, under the third section of the act of 1793,
which was read and commented on by the court, who then proceeded as follows.
" The Secretary of State is a ministerial officer, who must issue
a patent if the requisites are performed. 6 Peters, 241. The
question of inadvertence or mistake is a judicial one, which the
Secretary cannot decide, nor those judicial questions on which the
validity of the patent depends. He issues the patent without inquiry. The correct performance of all the preliminaries to the

388

Stimpqon v. West Chester Railroad Company.

validity of the original patent are always examinable in the court
where the fact is brought. 6 Peters, 242, 6, 47.
"In the application of the law to -the evidence before you, the
first inquiry is into the state of facts existing at the time of grant-ing the patent of 1835 ; did they present a case for renewal, under
the rules of law, on which we have given you our instructions ?
Whether the original patent was invalid or inoperative is more a
question -of law than fact, to be ascertained on a judicial inspection
of the patent, specification, drawings, models, and the evidence of
the contents ; the court must construe all w'ritten evidence ; but as
depositions are considered merely as oral testimony, a jury must
decide what parts are proved by them. The court must take as
true'the statements of witnesses as they are made, and lay down
tha law on the assumption' of their credibility, and both court and
jury must take an agreed or a~lmitted uncontested state of facts to
be., their rule of action ; a jury may deem 6Lwitness unworthy of
ere4it, or not believe his statement, but ought to do neither without good cause. Whether the defects in the old patent arose from
inadvertence or otherwise is also a mixed question of law and
fact, -of law so far as depends on written, and of fact as to
parol evidence; on this subject jou have the evidence of Dr.
Jones, who officially examined the old patent, &c., and made out
the new, and we are mainly left to ascertain the facts in relation to
both patents from him. In laying down the law to you, we assume
his verity in all*he-says, and, taking his statement as proof of the
facts there existing, our opinion is; that, connected with the publication in the Journal of the Franklin Institute, in 1832, when the
matter was fresh in his recollection, and the specification in the new
patent, the old one was invalid and inoperative, by reason of noncompliance with the requisites of the act of 1793. That it did not
embrace the groove, which was essential to its validity, that the
new patent-is not for the same invention, and that the plaintiff has
not made out a case of such inadvertence, accident, or mistake as
justified the issue of the new patent, inasmuch as it appears from
the patent for plates on railroads, issued at the same time with the
one for short curves, that he had known and described the grooves.
" It is for you to say, whether you will take this evidence as we
*do ; if you discredit it, in whole or in -part, you will find accordingly.
"Another important question arises in this case, on the construction of the seventh section of the act of 1839, taken in connection with former laws, which is, whether the plaintiff can sustain an action for the use of his invention, in the construction of
his curves, before the granting of the patent of 1835.
" This section provides, - I That every person or corporation
who has, or shall have, purchased or constructed any newly invented machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, prior to

JANUARY

TERM, 1846.

Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

the application by the inventer or discoverer for a patent, shall be
held to possess the right to use, and vend to others to be used, the
specific machine, manufacture, or composition so made or purchased, without liability therefor to the inventer, or any other person interested in such invention ; and no patent shall be held to be
invalid by reason of such purchase, sale, or use prior to the application for a patent as aforesaid, except on proof of abandonment
of such invention to the public, or that such purchase, sale, or
prior use has been for more than two years prior to such application for a patent.'
", Though this act is retrospective in its effects on then existing
patents, it is not void on that account ; it was within the constitutional power of Congress to enact it as a rule 'for all cases to which
its words and intentions apply, by its fair- and legal interpretation,
which we must ascertain by looking at the old law ; the mischief
and the remedy, which must be traced through the decisions of the
Supreme Court ; and the acts of Congress on the same subject.
"In 1808, an act was granted to Oliver Evans renawing his patent, which had expired by its own limitation ; in the interval, the
defendant had constructed a machine of his inventen, and continued to use it ; after the new patent issued, he was held liable,
according to the words of the law, for such subsequent use, but th&
Supreme Court thus express their opinion of the case, had it rested
on general principles

---

I The legislature might have proceeded

still further, by providing a shield for persons standing in the situation of these defendants ; it is believed that the reasonableness of
such a provision could have been questioned by no one, &c.,
&c. The argument, founded on the hardship of this and similar
cases, would be entitled to great weight, if the words of this proviso were obscure and open to construction.' Evans v. Jordan,
9 Cranch, 203."
And thereupon the counsel for the plaintiff did then and there
except to the aforesaid charge and opinion of the said court.
The above not being enough of the charge of -the court below
to the jury, the counsel for the plaintiff in error applied for and obtained a writ of certiorarito bring up additional exitracts.
The return was as follows.
On searching the record and proceedings of the Circuit Court
of the United States, in and for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in the third circtdit, in a certain cause therein lately depending
between James Stimpson, plaintiff, and the West Chester Railroad
Company, defendants, we find the following omission in the charge
of the judge to the jury, which, in obedience to the annexed writ
of certiorari,is hereby certified, to wit: -" In Morris v. Huntington, Judge Thompson held, that after a
patent was surrendered, the inveition would be open to public use

without hazard, so far as depends on such patent. 1 Paine, 355.
In Grant v. Raymond, the court notice the case of the use of the
invention between the date of the old and before the new 5atent,
but remark, that that defence is not made ; and the Circuit Court
did not say that such defence would not be successful ; and they
add, - I The defence, when true in fact, may be sufficient in law,
notwithstanding the validity of the new patent.' 6 Peters, 244.
The court, in this and the subsequent case of Shaw v. Cooper,
held, that the new patent was a continuation of the old, but gave
no opinion on the question, whether damages could be recovered
fbr the intermediate use of a machine constructed after the first.
" This question was, however, put at rest by the last clause of the
act of 1532, which, assuming that damages could not be recovered
for a use of the patented invention, before the new patent, provides : - ' But no public use or privilege of the invention so patented, derived from or after the grant of the original patent, either
under any special license of the inventer, or without the consent of
the patentee that there shall be a free public use thereof, shall in any
manner prejudice his right of recovery for any use or violation of
his invention, after the grant of such new patent as aforesaid.' The
act of 1836 is still more explicit, by providing for the right of recovering damages only for ' causes subsequently accruing.'
C1 It thus appears, that the act of 1839 goes only one step beyond those of 1832 and 1836, and is a dead letter, if it protects
the person who-has purchased, constructed, or used the machine invented by the patentee no farther than from damages accruing
prior to the new iatent, for the same protectibn is given by those
laws.
" To have any effect, it must be held to be, in the words of the
Supreme Court, ' a shield,' which covers th party from all liabil'ity, and by so construing it, the act of 1839 embodies the very principle, and none qther, which, in Evans v. Jordan, 9 Cranch, 203,
that court declared to be one which they believed that no one could
question its reasonableness, in order to prevent the hardship of a case
precisely similar in principle to that presented. Such construction is
the more reasonable, when it is considered that the protection is
confined to the specific machine used before the patent, and cannot
be extended to protect the use of any new or other machine, or construed to invalidate the patent, or justify the subsequent use by any
other persons than those so protected.
"1 That such was the intention of Congress in relation to an
original patent cannot be doubted, and we can perceive no reason
why they should omit the very case on which the Supreme Court
had so explicitly declared their opinions, if the words of the act
of 1808 would have permitted them to apply an unquestionable
principle. The act of 1839 not only does n6t exclude its applicacation, but authorizes and requires it. In referring to the applica-

tion for a patent, it was evidently intended to apply it to the patent
on which th3 patentee sought to recover, the renewed one, on which
alone his right rested, for the law cannot be presumed to be intended to apply to a patent which, being invalid or inoperative, as a
ground of action, had been surrendered, cancelled, and cancelled
by the act of the patentee himself, and was thus divested of all intrinsic efficiency by the acts of 1832 and 1836. It could have no
effect without the aid of the new one, and it would be absurd to
suppose that the law overlooked the application .for the only effective patent, and looked onl to that which derived new life from it ;
besides, the act of 1839 would take from a defendant the protection of the acts of 1832 and 1836, by confining its operation to the
old patent, for damages could then be recoverable for the use between the date and the renewal, - a conclusion wholly inadmissible
on a sound construction of either the acts in question.
" The act of 1832 expressly declares that the newpatent shall be
subject in all respects to the same matters of objection and defence
as the original one ; from which it necessarily follows, that if the
purchase or cbnstruction of a machine, before the application for an
original patent, would protect a defendant from all liability to the patentee, the same defence is available when applied to the new one.
" This view of the act of 1839 suffices for the purposes of the
present case ; a-broader one has been taken of it, in all its bearings,
in another distri'ct in this circuit, which it is not now necessary to
examine to decide the point now under consideration.
" In the case before us, it clearly appears that the defendants
constructed their railroad with the plaintiff's curves in 1834, one
year or more befote the plaintiff's application for his renewed patent ; consequentl3, they may continue its use without liability tothe plaintiff."
The case was argued by .llr. C. J. Ingersoll and Hr. J. R. Ingersoll, for the plaintiff in error, and .llr. .Thiles, for the defendants
in error.
i

The brief of the counsel on the part of the plaintiff in error was
as follows.
This case comes up for argument upon a bill of exceptions taken
by the plaintiff to the charge of the learned judge in the court below, by which, in effect, the jury were directed to find for the defendants, whidh they accordingly did.
The plaintiff took a patent, the 23d of August, 1831, for an invention or improvement in the application of the flanches of the
wheels on one side of railroad carriages, andl of the treads of the
wheels on the other side, to turn short curves upon railroads.
It was surrendered in consequence of a defect in the specification, and a new patent taken by him the 26th of September, 1835.

a92

SUPREME COURT.
Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

" The object of such surrender and renewal (see deposition of
Dr. Thomas P. Jones, a witness for the defendant, in answer to the
first cross interrogatory, ante, p. 384) was to limit and confine it to
the turning short curves m streets, &c., by leaving out certain matters-in it respecting the crossing of tracks or roads, and the passing
over turnabouts, and to define the subject-matter of the patent
more clearly, without its being necessary to refer to that simultaneously obtained for forming and using cast or wrought-iron plates,
The action was brought *at the October session, 1840. The
curves used by the defendants were said to have been constructed
and first used by them between the dates of the first anSI second
patents, the use being continued by them since the date of the
second patent.
The learned judge, after considering at length the law touching
this part of the case, said to the jury "It clearly appears that the defendants constructed their railroad with the plaintiff's curves in 1834, one year or more before

the plaintiff's application for his renewed patent; consequently, they
may continue its use without liability to the plaintiff."
In Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 244, the defendant made it a
question, whether the patentee who took an amended patent could
recover damages for the defendant's use, subsequent to the amendment of the patent, of machinery which had been constructed prior
to the amendment. The court did not decide tie point, thinking
it did not come directly up for decision. But they said of it, " This objection is more formidable in appearance than in reality.
It is not probable that the defect in the specification can be so apparent as to be perceived by any but those who examined it for
the purpose of pirating the invention."
'
Grant v. Raymonal was decided early in 1832.
On the 3d of July, 1832, was passed (4 Lit. & Brown's
ed. 559) the first act by which the amendment of patents for
defective specifications was statutorily recognized. The third section of the act contains a proviso, that the new patent shall be open
to all objections which existed against the old one, by virtue of
which, if the phrase stood alone, a defendant, in this case, for example, might say, I -used your curves before 1835, - before the
date of your patent, - that is, between the new patent and the old
one, and as a use by the public prior to the date of the patent
would be fatal as against the old patent, so it is against the new.
Now to meet such an argument, the same proviso goes on to
say, that no use of the patented invention between the dates of
the first and second patents, excepting under a surrender of the
invention to public use, shall prejudice the patentee's right to recover damages" for any use" after the grant of the new patent.
We quote at length the proviso of the third section.

JANUAR Y TERM,

Stimpson v. West Cheater Railroad Company.

"Provided however, That such new patent so gtanted ,shall, in
all respects, be liable to the same matters of objection and defence
as any original patent granted under the said first-mentioned'act.
"But no public tie br privilege of the invention so patented,
derived from or after the grant of the original, either under my
special license of the inventer, or without the consent of the-patentee that there shall be a free public use thereof, shall, in any manner, prejudice his right of recovery for any use or violation of his,
,invention after the grant of such new patent as aforesaid."
It is submitted, that, by the terms of this statute, to use, after the
date of ihe second patent, the patented machinery, even though the
specific machine used bad been constructed and used between the
dates of the first and second patents, is expressly denied to the
public.
On the faith of this statute of the 3d July, 1832, the plaintiff; in
September, 1835, surrendered the patent'granted him the 23d
August, 1831, and took an amended one.
Has any act of Congress changed the law in this particular since
1832 ?
As any such law, so far as regards. .is plaintiff; would be retroactive, it ought to be clearly expressed.
On the 6th of July, 1836, was passed the new patent act, by which
the whole system was recast, but the thirteenth section, which relates to amended patents, says in broad terms :"And the patent so reissued, together with the corrected description and specification, shall have the same effect and operation
in law, on the trial of all actions hereafter commenced, for causes
subsequently accruing, as though the same had been originally
filed in such corrected form before the issuing of the original
patent."
It is submitted that the words, "for causes subsequently accruing," are not to be *trained from their natural construction, in
order to be made to retroact against the rights already vested under
the protection of a statute ; and that the cause of action against
these defendants, as far as concerns their use of the patented invention since the 26th of September, 1835, is a cause subsequently
accruing, within the just and obvious meaning of the act.
In 1837, the 3d of March, was passed an amendment to the
law of 1836.
The plaintiff submits that the seventh and ninth sections of the
act of 1837 bear on,his case, by analogy. They permit a patentee who has patented too much, and more than he invented, to
make disclaimer of the excess, with the same eff-ct, as regards the
validity of the patent, as if his disclaimer were part of his original
specification. That is to say, the patentee shall recover as if his
patent had been originally right instead of wrong ; and no exception is made in favor of parties who, like the defendants here, use.

394

Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

after disclaimer, one of the patented things, which they bad con,
structed and begun to use while the patent was too broad; the
legislature being influenced, perhaps, by the suggestion of this court
inGrant t. Raymond, that that party is not entitled to much favor,
who scans a specification in order to piratd'it.
On the 3d of March, 1839, the latest amendment of the patent
laws was passed.
The seventh section of this adt is cited by the learned judge,
who asks-, what this section means, if it do not mean that the use of
a patented machine shall be free to a defendant after the patent, if
he constructed it before. It reads thus :"Sect. 7. .fnd be itfurther enacted, That every person or corporation who has, or shall have, purchased or constructed any newly
invented machine, manufacture, -or composition of matter, prior to
the application by the inventer or discoverer for a patent, shall be
held to possess the right to use, and to vend to others to be used,
the specific machine, manufacture, or composition of matter so
made or purchased, without liability therefor to 1he inventer, or any
other person interested in such invention ; and no patent shall be
held to be invalid by reason of such purchase,.sale, or use, prior to
the application for a patent as aforesaid, except on proof of abandonment of such invention to the public, or that such purdhase,
sale, or prior use has been for more than two years prior.to such
application for a patent."
It is admitted, in answer to the learned judge, that the seventh
section of the act of 1839 was intended to protect defendants, constructers of machinery prior to the patent, in the use of such machinery after the grant to the patentee. This section, which has no
reference to renewed or amended, more than to all other, patents, is
believed to provide for a case, till 1839 unprovided for ; namely,
the case in general, whether it arise under an original patent, or
under one which has been amended, or which has been modified by
disclaimer of the use by a defendant, after the issuing of the letters,
of a machine such as they patent, but which spdcific machine was
purchased or constructed before their date. .But it is respectfully
submitted, that this prior use meant a use prior to the firs- or original application of the inventer for his- patent, and that tb legislature had not in their contemplation the second application of the
inventer, when they used the words " prior to the application of
the inventer or discoverer for a patent." The last clause of the
section ba5 obvious reference to the original application alone,
when it is declared that "such purchase, sale, or use, prior to the
application for a patent," shall not (except under certain circumstances) make the patent invalid ; for it was clear already, and
quite independentlyof this statute, that no renewed or amended
patent could be worth paying for, if the use of the patented rpachinery by third plersons, prior to the renewal, could make it invalid.

JANUARY

TERM, 1846.

Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad CoMpany.

Grant v. Raymond, however, furnishes the best answer to th-.
learned judge's position, that the plaintiff's patent is liable to be
damaged by what has taken place since the date of the original letters. At page'244 (6 Peters), the court says :"1It has also been argued, That the new patent must issue on the
new specification, and on the application which accompanies it.
Consequently, it will not be true that the machine was ' not known
or used before the application.' But the new patent, and the proceedings on which it issues- have relation to the original transaction.
The time of the privilege still runs from the date of the original
patent. The application may be considered as appended to the
original application."
The plaintiff in error contends, that a true interpretation of the
letter of these several acts, and a due regard to the spirit of all
recent legislation on the subject of patent-rights, which has been
kind and liberal towards patentees, enforce the conclusion, that it
was meant, when the new patent was granted, to give to the new,
in all particulars, the charter of the old, unless when restrained by
express words to narrower limits. And further, that while, for
obvious reasons, the acts deny to the patentee a right to recover
damages, under the new patent, for a use of the invention of earlier
date than the patent itself (which denial is in terms), no express
words of the s.tatutes, or fair or.necessary implication from them, or
leaning, can be found, in the whole course of the legislation since
1832, to warrant the conclusion that the new patent does not confer
upon the grantee an entire monopoly of the fruits of his invention,
from the date of the second letters to the expiration of the fourteen
years from the date of the first.
The plaintiff in error therefore assigns for error the ]earned
judge's instructions to the jury, recognizing the defendants' right
to use the patented invention, after the date of the second patent,
provided they had commenced its use prior to that date, and continued after that.date to use only the specific machine at first used.
The learned judge also charged the whole case to be against the
plaintiff upon another question, namely, that of the description of
the 11groove, " in the original patent.
The judge was of opinion that the groove was not in the first
patent, and was in the second ; and therefore that the second was
broader than the first, and not confined to the thing there patented,
and thus was defective as an amended patent. The plaintiff's
patent being, as he supposed, established fully, by judicial sanction
of the highest sort, in his contest with the Trenton Railroad Corpany, reported in 14 Peters, 448, had not e.ven, brought with him,
when he came to try his cause in Philadelphia, the original letters
patent, and the drawings which accompanied them. Nor was any
notice given him by'the defendant to produce them.

SUPREME COURT.
Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

Railroad Company, tried in the Maryland District, in April term,
1843, when both the original patent and the dihawings were produced
in court, proved to be quite ill founded the attempt of the defendants, in the present case, to criticise his second patent as actually
varying from the first, by the addition of this new matter, the
groove.
He is aware, however, that he must sustain his case as it appears
by this record, and he proceeds to do so.
The whole invention of the plaintiff consisted of a new method
of attaining conical action in turning short curves on railroads.
And the groove had no more to do with it than this: - that when
to attain this action the outer wheel was mounted upon its flanch,
the groove, by receiving the inner wheel, prevented the car from
slipping off the track -a very material consideration, it is true -in
turning the corner ; and so was the car, or the steam-engine that
drew the car; but neither of them had any thing to do with the
plaintiff's method of producing conical action. Without a groove,
just as without steam, a horse, or othek power, the comer could not
be turned; and therefore, in describing the plaintiffIs invention,
both this power and the groove must needs be referred, to ; but it
is respectfully denied, that more than the merest allusion to either
is necessary, neither of them being any part of the invention, nor
so occult as to demand, for even the most unenlightened observer,
more than a mere allusion to it.
Now it was in proof from the witness called by the defendant to
testify to the contents of the original specification, that it alluded to
the groove.
"'I believe, however, that it (the groove) was alluded to in this
specification." - Evidence of Df.. J ones.
This allusion to the groove, in the first patent, the learned judge
rules, in his charge, to be insufficient, and in the paragraph ante, pp.
387, 388, after so holding, he goes on to declare, that the groove

should have been "claimed."
It may be mentioned that it is not
claimed in the new patent, nor even alluded fo in the summary of
the specification ; so collateral is it to the invention.

The plaintiff in error further assigns for error, in this portion of
the charge touching the groove, the learned judge's decision against
the. plaintiff's right to claim under his patent, because of his alleged

omission in regard to the groove ; and particularly to the judge's
saying, that, assuming the truth of Dr. Jones's deposition, the
opinion of the court was, that the old patent was " invalid and
inoperative, by reason of noncompliance with the requisition of the
act of 1793. That it did not embrace the groove, which was

essential to its validity ; that the new patent is not for the same
invention."
Also, the learned judge's taking from the jury the question, which
came fairly up as a question of fact, namely, whether this mention

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

39

Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

of, or allusion to, the groove was or was not too slight a description
of that part of the combination to enable one skilled as an engineer
to make a curve, or to stand for a compliance, by the patentee, with
the requisition of the statute touching the proper description of the
inventionw.
Also, the learned judge's deciding it to be a matter of law, -and
not of fact for the jury, what the thing patented in 1831 was, when
the evidence of what it was lay not in a written paper, which the
judge could read and construe, but in parol evidence, and explanations per testes.
Also, the learned judge's not giving the due legal eftect to the
secretary's seal and letters patent, as prima facie evidence that the
second patent legitimately succeeded to the first, and to his assuming,
on the contrary, that it was incumbent on the plaintiff, and not on
the defendant (who assailed it), to show what the first patent contained, and what its character and defects were, and in the absence
of the patent, and of any notice or call for it by the defendant, and
in the absence of any satisfactory account of its contents to the
learned judge, making the plaintiff, and not the defendant, responsible for the imperfectness of the proofs regarding the same.
The judge left nothing to the jury, as distinctly appears in his
summing up, in regard to the groove (ante, p. 388), but the question
whether Dr. Jone's testimony was to be believed or not. If believed, he told the jury they must find for the defendants, the old
patent being defective, in not embracing the groove, and the new
patent, which he said did embrace it, being therefore for a different
invention altogether. The plaintiff in error also assigns it for error, that the learned
judge ruled "mistake," in the statute about amending patents, to
mean inadvertence or accident only, and excluded cases of honest
mistakes of judgment.
Mr. iiles, for the defendants in error, filed the following brief.
.!bstract of Case:
1. This is a writ of error to the Circuit Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiff in the Circuit Court is the
plaintiff in error in this court. The verdict in the Circuit Court
was for the defendants.
2. The action was brought to recdver damages for an alleged infringement by the defendants of an exclusive right,,alleged to belong
to the plaintiff, to make, use, construct, and vend an improvement
" in the mode of turning short curves on railroads," of which he
claimed to be the original inventer, and alleged to have been secured
to him by letters patent of the United States, according to the acts
of Congress.
The plaintiff claimed under letters patent, dated September 26th,

398

SUPREME COURT.
Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

1835, which recited that letters for the same improvement were
granted to him on August 23d, 1831, but which were "hereby
cancelled on account of a defective specification."
3. The plaintiff declared on the letters patent of September
26th, 1835, in four counts (only varying in the allegation of different.modes of infringement, namely, making, constructing, selling,
and using), all setting forth that "1the said letters patent (that is, of
August 23d, 1831) were cancelled in due form of law, on account
of a defective specification."
4. The defendants pleaded not guilty, gave due notice to the plaintiff, under the acts of Congress, of a defence based upon the want
of originality of invention of the thing patented on the part of the
plaintiff, under the several patents of 1831 and 1835, said notice
including the prior use and knowledge of other persons, and of prior
printed and published descriptions of the same, &c., and under such
plea and notice gave evidence to the jury.
The original letters of the 23d of August, 1831, were not in
evidence, they having been destroyed in the conflagration of the
patent-office in December, 1836, nor was there any copy of them
given in evidence.
Their loss or destruction having been proved, secondary evidence was given of their contents. (Journal Franklin Institute,
vol. 9, p. 124, No. 37 ; and by deposition of Dr. Thomas P.
Jones.)
The claim, by this evidence, undet the patent of 1831, was "to
the ,application of the flaliches of railroad carriage-wheels to turn
short durvatures upon railroads or tracks, particularly turning the
corners of streets, wharves, crossing of tracks or roads, and passing over turnabouts," &c. No mention was made therein'of the
use of a groove upon the inner circle for the flanch to run in, so as
to enable the wheel on the inner circle to run on its tread, without
which there was evidence. tending to show that the whole alleged
invention was usel6ss.
The claim uhder the patent of k835 was to "1the application of
the flanches of-the wheels on one side of railroad carriages, and of
the treads of the wheels on the other side, to turn curves upon railways,".&c., "operating upon the principles herein set forth." The
specification referred to in this summary describes the use of the
flanch running on the surface of the outer rail, and of the tread
running on the inner rail, which is formed with a groove to receive
the flanch of the wheel on the inner rail, as the essential parts,
which, combined together, form the improvement.
5. Upon the trial, several questions of law and of fact arose.
His honor, MIr. Justice Baldwin, charged the jury upon the law,
and left the facts falling within the scope of the principles of the
law, as laid down by him, to the determination of the jury.

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

Points of Law arising under the Charge contended for by Defendants.
The third section of the act of 21st February, 1793, in substance, provides that the applicant for a patent shall give a description, in full, clear, and exact terms, of the thing invented, and its
modes of application.
By the sixth section of the same act, a defendant in a suit
brought op letters patent may show that the description (that is,
specification) does not contain the whole truth relative to his discovery, or that it contains more than is necessary- to produce the
desired effect, which boncealment or addition shall fully appear to
have been made for the purpose of deceiving the public, or that the
thing secured by patent was not originally discovered by the
patentee, &c.
The third section of the act of July 3, 1832, provides, in substance, that if any patent shall be invalid or inoperative by reason
of noncompliance with the terms of the third section of the act of
1793, by "inadvertence, accident, or mistake," and " without any
fraudulent or deceptive intention," it may be lawful for the Secreta*ry of State, on surrender of the original patent, to grant a new
patent, on compliance with the conditions of the third section of the
act of 1793, for the residue of the -term unexpired.
The thirteenth and fifteeiith sections of the act of 4th July,
1836, which supplied the former laws enacted on the subject, contain in substance the same provisions as to the inoperation of a
patent by reason of the defective description, and allowing a surrender and regrant, where the defect arose from "inadvertency,
accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention."
The seventh section of the act of Iarch 3, 1839, provides,
"that every person or corporation who has, or shall have, purchased or constructed any newly invented machine, &c., prior to
the application by the inventer, &c., for a patent," may use and
vend it at all times, without liability to the inventer or any person, &c.
Under these acts, the following points are submitted to have
been judicially decided.
1. That where a patentee, under the act of February 21st, 1793,
has not complied with the terms of its third section, even through
inadvertence, accident, or mistake, the plaintiff cannot recover for
an infringement prior to a surrender and new grant. Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 244 ; Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 320 ; Whitney
v. Emmett, 1 Bald. 303.
1. That if the patentee under the act of 1793 has not complied
with the terms of its third section, through fraudulent and deceptive
intention, by concealment of or addition to his real discovery, his

400

SUPREME COURT.
Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Company.

patent, by the sixth section, is absdlutely void. Grant v. Raymond, 8 Peters, 246, 247 ; Whitney v. Emmett 1 Bald. 303.
3. (1.) That a surrender under the ac- in 1832 and a new
grant are only sustainable where the defect in the description of the
first patent was, the result of inadvertence, accident, or mistake.
Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 246, 247. (2.) That a new grant, on
such a surrender, is not sustainable, but is absolutely void, T it appear that the defect in the description of the first patent, whethe, ')f
concealment or addition, was the result of a fraudulent and deceptive
intention on the part of the patentee. (3.) That if a patentee surrendered his first patent, and, under pretence of an inadvertence, accident, or mistake in its description, obtained a new patent, adding
thereto a new material or element of which he was not the original
inventer, and which is necessary to make the thing patented useful,
thus in the second patent specifying another combination, constituting a mode or machine substantially different from that described
and claimed in the first,'it is fraud in the patentee, and the patent is
void. Grant v. Rayinond, 6 Peters, 218, 244 ; Philadelphia Railroad v. Stimpson, 14 Peters, 462 ; Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 292.
.Note. The act of 1832 (July 3d), authorizing a surrender and
regrant,.shortly foflowe I the decision in Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters (January. term, 1832), and by express enactment provided
for that which had before been allowed by practice and judicial construction only.
4. That an original patent, as well as that granted on a surrender
of the first under these acts, are prima facie evidence only of the'
novelty and utility of the alleged invention, and of the compliance
by the patentee with the' terms of the several acts of Congress
entitling him to. a patent; but their validity is examinable in a
judicial proceeding upon any such patent, part of the inquiry being
within the province of the court where the construction of written
documents is to be made, and part being for the determination of
the jury where questions of fact are involved. Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peterg, 218 ; Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 292 ; Philadelphia Railroad v. Stimpson, 14 Peters, 448 ; Prouty v. Ruggles,
16 Peters, 336.
5. If a patentee's first patent be inoperative for want of a full
and exact description, and-he stands by for a long and unreasonable
period of time, without surrendering and remedying the defect by
furnishing such a description, and obtaining a regrant, and in the
mean time permits others to use what he subsequently claims to be
his invention, with a knowledge of such use without objection or
asserting his right, this is evidence from which a jury may infer his
acquiescence and abandonment to the public as a matter of fact.
Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 320- 322.
6. Under the act of 1839, if the defendants purchased or constructed this mod-. of turning curves, before the application for the

patent of 1835, and this combination or mode described in that
patent was newly invented by the patentee, the plaintiff cannot recover., notwithstanding the act of 1839 was subsequent to the dates
of such purchase or construction, and the patent of 1835. Shaw
v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 320- 322 ; McClurg v. Kingsland, 1 Howard, 2D4 ; Evans v. Jordan, 9 Cranch, 201.
.Note 1. This statute was intended to provide expressly and in
terms (designating a specific point of time) for all that class of
cases of implied acquiescence and waiver in favor of the public
resulting from the negligence of the patentee, by which judicial
construction held that the patentee had no claim against persons using or constructing the alleged invention under such circumstances.
.Note 2. This action was brought in the Circuit Court after
the passage of ihe act of 1839, to wit, at the October session, 1840.
The charge of the court left all the facts falliiig within the
scope of the legal principles therein stated to the determination of
the jury.
1. "The question of the validiy of the new patent is a judicial
one, depending on the fact of inadvertence or fraud, as you shall find
it." "You must then be satisfied affirmatively," &c. "The finding of the fact of inadvertence may negative the fact of fraud," &c.

Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for an i.
fringement of his patent, for a "1new and useful improvement in
the mode of turning short curves on railroads." The questions for
decision arise on exceptions to the charge of the court to the jury.
And here it may be proper to remark, that the exceptions are to
the charge as published at length, and not to the points ruled by
the court, as is the correct practice. Under the peculiar circumstances of this case, the court will not dismiss the writ of error
upon this ground, but it is expected that a different course will hereafter be pursued.
On the 21st of August, 1831, the plaintiff obtained a patent for
an invention or improvement in the applibation of the flanches of
the wheels on one side of railroad carriages- and of the treads of

the wheels on the other side, to turn short curves upon railroads,
The spocifications of this patent being defective, it was surrendered
the 26th of September, 1835, and a renewed one obtained, in
order, as proved, "to limit and confine it to the turning short
curves in streets, &c., by leaving out certain matters in it respecting the crossing of tracks or roads, and the passing over turnabouts, and to define the subject-matter of the patent more clearly,
without its being necessary to refer to that simultaneously obtained,
for forming and using cast or wrought-iron plates," &c.
In his charge, the judge said to the jury, -"
It clearly appears
that the defendants constructed their railroad with the plaintiff's
curves in 1834, one year or more before the plaintiff's application
for his renewed patert ; consequently, they may continue its use
without liability to the plaintiff.'!
The patent was surrendered, and a new one obtained, under
the third section of the" "Act concerning patents," of the 3d of
July, 1832-; and the correctness of the above opinion is to be ascertained by a reference to the proviso of that section. It is there
declared, - "No public use or privilege of the invention so
patented, derived from or after the grant of the- original patent,
either under any special license of the invehter, or without ihe consent of the patentee that there' shall be a free public use thereof,
shall, in any manner, prejudice his right of recovery for any use or
violation of his invention, after the grant of such new patent as
aforesaid."
The charge of infringement, in the declaration, is laid some years
after the new patent, so that the question does not arise, whether
an action could be sustaindd for a violation of the right prior to the
corrected patent. The above proviso would seem to be susceptible of but one'construction ; and that is, that the patentee may sustain an action " for any use or violation of his invention after the
grant of the new patent." Now it is plain that no prior use of the
defective patent can authorize the use of. the invention after the
emanation of the renewed patent under the above section. To
give to the patentee the fruits of his invention was the object of the
provision ; and this object would be defeated, if a right could be
founded on a use subsequent to the original patent and prior to the
renewed one.
The thirteenth section of the act of the 4th of July, 1836, which
remodelled the patent law in this respect, made no material change
in the act of 1832. The words in. the latter act are, -"
And the
patent, so reissued, together with the corrected description and
specification, shall have the same effect and operation in law, on the
trial of all actions hereafter commenced for causes subsequently act
ctuing, as though the same bad been originally filed in such corrected form, before the issuing out of the original patent." Now

quently to the date of this act is guilty of an infiingement, however long he may have used the same after the date of the defective
and surrendered patent.
The Circuit Court relied upon the seventh section of the act of
the 3d of March, 1839, as sustaining their constructioii in regard
to th6 use of the invention after the renewed patent. But that section has exclusive reference to an original application for a patent,
and not to a renewal of it. We think the court erred in their instruction to the jury above stated.
In their charge, the court said,-" The use of grooves was not
claimed and was no part of the thing patented in 1831, for turning
short curves, but was a part of the thing patented in 1835."
"That it was an essential part of the invention." And further,
"in taking the statement" of Dr. Jones " as proof of the facts
there existing, our opinion is, that, comiected with the publication in the Journal of the Franklin Institute, in 1832, when the
matter was fresh in his recollection, and the specification in the
new patent, the old one was invalid and inoperative, by reason of
noncompliance with the requisites of the act of 1793. That it did
not embrace the groove, which was essential to its validity, that the
new patent is not the same invention, and that the plaintiff has
not made out a case of such ' inadvertence, accident, or mistake,'
as justified the issue of the new patent, inasmuch as it appears,
from the patent for plates on railroads issued at the same time with
the one for short curves, that he had known and described the
grooves."
The original patent, as proved by Dr. Jones, was burnt with the
patent-office, and no part of the specifications is preserved, except
that which was published by the witness in the Franklin Journal.
That publication does not purport to give the whole of the specification*, and, consequently, the claim is not limited by the notice in
that journal. Doctor Jones, speaking of the patent issued in 1831,
says, -" 1 The main defect, in my judgment, of the original specifications in the patent for turning short curves was the omission of
the mention of the groove ih the inner rail. I believe, however,
that it was alluded to in the specifications, but the description of it
was contained principally, if not wholly, in the specification of the
patent .for forming and using cast-iron or wrought plates," &c.
That there was a defect in regard to -the grooves in the specifications of the first patent is shown, and also that the patent was surrendered in order to remedy that defect. But whether this vitiated
the patent is not a question in this case, as it does not affect the right
now asserted, if the first patent were void. Whether the new patent was substantially for a different invention from the first one,
was a question for the jury on the evidence. But the court ruled
this point, withdrawing the facts from the jury. The witness thinks
"1that in the first patent the grooves were alluded to," but the

terms used are not recollected by him, and as the patent has been
burnt, they cannot now be proved. We think the Circuit Court
erred in not leaving the jury to act upon the facts, as regards the
difference between the original and th& renewed patent. On the
facts, we should draw a different conclusion from that which was
given to the-jury by the Circuit Court. An allusion .o grooves in
this specification, as more particularly described in the other patent,
would at least show the intention of the patentee, if it did not make
good his patent.
By the thirteenth section of the act of 1836, "if the patent
shall be inoperative or invalid, by reason of.a defective or insufficient description or specification," &c., "1if the error has or shall
have arisen by inadvertency, accident, or mistake, and without any
fraudulent or deceptive intention, it shall be lawful" to surrender
it, &c. Now, as in granting the renewed patent the officers of the
government act under the above rovisions, their decision must at
least be considered as prinm facie evidence that the claim for a
renewal was within the statute. But this would not be conclusive
against fraud in the surrender and renewal, which, on the evidence,
would be a matter for the jury. And we suppose that the inquiry
in regard to .the surrender is limited to the fairness of the transaction. In whatever'manner the mistake or inadvertence may have
occurred is immaterial. The action of the government in renewing
the patent must be considered as closing this point, and as leaving
open for inquiry, before the court and jury, the question of fraud
only.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the qause
remanded to that court, with instructions to award a venirefacia de
11050.
