v. Butcn4s.-

HAGAN, & CO., FOR THE USE OF WLLIAX HOLTIDAY & CO,
A plaintiff has a right to direct a deputy-marshal to receive a certain description of
money in satisfaction of an execution.
but the deputy-marshal then acts as agent of the plakitiff, and not as agent of the
marshal.
Ii, themefore, the plaintiff, when he does ths gives to the deputy-marshal other instructions, which are disobeyed, the marshal himself is not responsible, but the

plaintiff must look to the deputy.

THIS case was brought up, by writ of -error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Mississippi.
-A judgment was obtained in that court, at May teN., 1839, by
the defendants in error against Ephrnim Gwinn and J.,mes Bal
lance, for the sum of $ 2,679-88, with interest at the. rate of eight
per cent., from the 27th of May, 1839, until paid, and costs.
An execution was sued out upon this judgment 'on the 28th of
June,- 1839, and property of the defendants levied upon to the
amount due on the execution, which property was suffered to remain in their possession, according to a law of that State, upontheir executing a forthcoming bond with sufficient security. This
bond was returned by William M. Gwinn, the marshal, at the
next term (Nqvember term, 1839), "forfeited," whereby the said
bond, according to the laws of Mississippi, had the force and
effect of a judgment against the defendants in the original judgment, and their securities in the said bond.
Upon this last mentioned judgment, anothdrfi.f. was issued on
the 19th of- December, 1839, returnable to the next term of the
court, to be held on the first Monday of May, 1840. This fi.fa.

J'ANUARY TERM, 1846.

Gwinn v. Buchanan, Hagan, & Co.

William M. Gwinn, the marshal, for the amount of the debt, interest, and costs due upon-the judgment of the forthcoming bond.
An exception was ten to this opinion of the court, and the
present writ of error brought by the marshal upon this judgment
against him.
The case was argued by the Attorney-general, for the plaintff in
error. No counsel appeared for the defendants.
Mr. Chief-Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.
As a general principle, it is undoubtedly true, that the marshal
is responsible far the acts of his deputy in the execution of process; and if the deputy had taken the funds mentioned in.the 'testimony without any orders from the plaintiffs, or their attorney,
and-retumed the execution satisfied, the plaintiffs would not have
been bound to accept these funds in discharge of their judgment,
and might have insisted on the full amount from the marshal in
gold and silver.
But it is clear, that the plaintiffs had a right to accept in payment of their execution whatever they thought proper. The
deputy-marshal was bound to obey their directions. upon that'subject ; and neither the deputy nor the marshal can be held responsible to the plaintiffs for any loss they may sustain by reason of an
act done in pursuance of their own instructions.
But the plaintiffs seem to suppose that the authority given to
the deputy was not pursued, and that the payment of the money
to them without delay was a condition annexed to the authority,
which had been disregarded by the deputy. But however this
may be, as between him and the plaintiffs, the act or omission of
the deputy in that respect cannot make the marshal himself liable.
Gwinn knew nothing of the directions given by the plaintiffs' attorney. So far' as Ferguson was acting as deputy-marshal, he
had no right to receive, in payment of the debt, any thing but
gold and silver. He had no authority from the marshal to take
any thin& else. But when the plaintiffs interfered, and directed
him to receive the funds above mentioned, he was, in receiving
such funds, not acting under the authority of the marshal as his
deputy, bVut as agent of the plaintiffs; . And if, in executing the
power they gave him, he disobeyed their instructions; they must
look to him, and not to the marshal, who knew nothing of these
instructions, had no concern with them, and who cannot, therefore, upon principles -of law or equity, be held responsible for the
manner in which they were executed.
The judgment of the Circuit Court must, therefore, be reI
versed, with costs.
