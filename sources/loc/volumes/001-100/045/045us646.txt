WILSON. PLAINTIFF, v. LEwis

ROUSSnIu

AND

CHARLES

EAsT N.
The eighteenth section of the patent act of 1836 authorized the extension of a
patent, on the application of tie executor or administrator of a deceased patentee.
Such, an extension does not inure to the benefit of assignees under the orijinal
patent, but to the benefit of the administrator (when granted to an administrator), in-his capacity as such. But those assignees who were in the use of the
patented machine at the time of the renewal have still a right to use it.
The extension could be applied for and obtained by the administrator, although the
original patentee had, n his lifetime, disposed of all his interest in the then
existing patent. Such sale did not carry any thing beyond the term of the
original patebt.
A covenant by the-patentee, made prior to the law authorizing extensions, that the
covenantee should have the benefit of any improvement in the machinery, or
alteration or renewal of the patent, did not include the extension by an administrator, under the act of 1836. It must be construed to includb only renewals
bbtained upon the surrender of a patent on account of a defective specification.
Parties to contracts look to established and general laws, and not to special acts
of Conress.
A pjaintif therefore, who claims under an assignment from the administrator, can
maintain a suit against a person who claims under the covenant
An assignee of an exclusive right to use two machines within a particular district
!-.an maintain an action for an infringement ofthe patentwithin that district, even
against the patentee.
Ithe case of Woodworth's planing-machine, the patent granted to the administrator was founded upon a sufficient specification and proper drawings, and
is valid.
The decision of the Board of Commissioners, to whom the question of renewal is
referred, by the act of 1836, is not conclusive upon the question of their jurisdiction to act in a given case.
The Commissioner of Patents can lawfully receive a surrender of letters patent
for a defective specification, and issue new letters patent upon an amended specification, after the expiration of the term for which the orig,nal patent was
granted, and pending the existence of an extended term of seven Tears. Such
surrender and renewal m.y be made at any time during such extended term.

THis case, and the three subsequent ones, namely, Wilson v.
Turner, Simpson et al. v. Wilson, and Woodworth & Bunn v. Wilson, were-argued together, being known as the patent cases.* Many
of the points of law involved were common to them all, and those
which were fully argued in the first case which came up were hut
incidentally touched in the discussion of the subsequent cases.
* The reporter intended to publish the arguments of counsel in these patent
cases in extenso, and with that view applied for and obtained from many of
'the c6unsel their arguments prepared by themselves; but circumstances beyond
his control prevent hin from executing this purpose. He returns his thanks to
those gentlemen who so kindly furnished him with their arguments, and regrets
that his original design has been frustrated.

Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

They all related to the rights which were derived under a patdt
for a planing-machine, taken out by Woodworth, and renewed and
extended by his administrators. The validity of the original patent
was questioned only in one case, namely, that which came from
Kentucky, which was the last argued. There were four cases in
all, namely, one from New York, one from Maryland, one from
Louisiana, and one from Kentucky. In the course of the argument, counsel referred indiscriminately to the four records, as some
documents were in one which were not to be found in another.
The cases will be taken up and reported seriatim, and the documents which are cited in the first will not be repeated in the
others.
The first in order was the case from New York, the titling of
which is given at the head of this report.
It came up from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern District of New York, on a certificate of division in
opinion.
On the 26th of November, 1828, William Woodworth presented the following petition.
"To the Honorable Henry Clay, Secretary of State of the United
States.
" The petition of William Woodworth, of the city of Hudson, in
the county of Columbia and State of New York, respectfully
represents :
"That your petitioner has invented a new and improved method
of planing, tonguing, grooving, and cutting into mouldings, or
either, plank, boards, or any other material, and for reducing the
same to an equal width and thickness; and also for facing and
dressing brick, and cutting mouldings on, or facing, metallic, mineral, or other substances, not knotvn or used before ifie application
by him, the advantages of which he is desirous of securing to himself and his" legal representatives. He therefore prays that letters
patent of the United States may be issued, granting unto your petitioner, his heirs, administrators, or assigns, the full and exclusive
right of making, constructing, using, and vending to others to be
used, his aforesaid new and improved method, agreeably to the acts
of Congress in such case made and provided ; your petitioner
having paid thirty dollars into the treasury of the United States,
and complied with the other provisions of the said acts.

Schedule.
rt ine schedule referred to in these letters patent, and making
part of the same, containing a description, in the words of the
said William Woodworth himself, of his improvement in the
method of planing, tonguing, grooving, and cutting into mouldings,
or either, plank, boards, or any other material, and for reducing the
same to an equal width and thickness ; and also for fa.ng and
dressing brick, and cutting mouldings on, or facing, metallic, mmeral, or other substances.
" The plank, boards, or other material, being reduced to a
width by circular saws or friction-wheels, as the case may be, is
then placed on a carriage, resting on a platform, with a rotary cutting-wheel in the centre, either horizontal or vertical. The heads
or circular plates, fixed to an axis, may have one of the heads
movable, to accommodate any length of knife required. The
knife fitted to the head with screws or bolts, or the knives or cutters for moulding fitted by screws or bolts to logs, connecting the
heads of the cylinder, and forming with the edges of the knives or
cutters a cylinder. The knives may be placed in a line with the
axis of the cylinder, or diagonally. The plank, or other material
resting on the carriage, m'y be set so as to reduce it to any thickness required; and the carriage, moving by a rack and pinion, or
rollers, or any lateral motion, to the edge of the knives or cutters
on the periphery of the cylinder or wheel, reduces it to any given
thickness. After passing the planing and reducing wheel, it then
approaches, if required, two revolving cutter-wheels, one for cutting the groove, and the other for cutting the rabbets that form the
tongue ; one wheel is placed directly over the other, and the lateral motion moving the plank, or other material, between the grooving and rabbeting. wheels, so that one edge has a groove cut the
whole length, and the other edge a rabbet cut on each side, leaving
a tongue to match the groove. The grooving-wheel is a circular
plate fixed on an axis, with a number of cutters attached to it to
project beyond the periphery of the plate, so that when put in motion it will perform a deep cut or groove, parallel with the face of
the plank or other material. The rabbeting-wheel, also of similar
form, having a number of cutters on each side of the plate, projecting like those on the grooving-wheel, cuts the rabbet on the side
of the edge of the, plank, and leaves the tongue or match for the

groove. By placing the planing-wheel axis and cutter-knives vertical, the same wheel will plane two planks or other material in the
same time of one, by moving the plank or other material opposite
ways, and parallel with each other against the periphery of the
planing or moulding wheel. The groove and tongue may be cut
m the plank or other material at the same time, by adding a grooving and rabbeting wheel.
" Said William Woodworth does not claim the, invention of circular saws or cutter-wheels, knowing they have long been in
use ; but he claims as his invention the improvement and application of cutter or planing wheels to planing boards, plank, timber,
or other inaterial ; also his improved method of cutters for grooving and tonguing, and cutting mouldings on wood, stone, iron,
metal, or other material, and also for facing and dressing brick ; as
all the wheels may be used single and separately for moulding, or
any other purpose before indicated. He also claims, as his improved method, the application of circular saws for reducing floorplank, and other materials, to a width.

"The machinery for the improvement consists,
"1st. Of a frame of wood or metal.

for the above-named operation, the principle of which consists inrunning tho plank, boards, or t;mber over, under, or at the sides of a
cylinder of wood or metal, on which knives are placed, straight or
spiral, with their edges exactly corresponding with each other, having from two to twelve knives or edges ; also burrs or saws, similar to those used for cutting teeth in bra:s wheels, to groove and
tongue the edge of the boards or plank as they pass through between rollers, or on a carriage, by the surface of the cylinder.

v. Rousseau et al.

The shape, form, and construction of the above principle may be
varied in shape and position, dimensions, &c., still the same in
substance, - the same principle producing the same effect. I
have, by experimental operation, found that the following mode in
form is the best :"1 st. A frame composed of two .pieces of timber, from twelve
to eighteen feet long, about six by ten inches broad, placed about
fifteen inches apart, framed together with four girths, one at each
end, and at equal distances from the centre, and flush with the
under side. This frame is supported by posts of a proper length,
framed into the under side of the above pieces of tiiber, and
braced so as to be of sufficient strength to maintain the operative
posts. There is placed a roller in the centre, of metal or hard
wood, across the frame, the surface of the roller being even with
the surface of the frame ; directly above, and parallel with this
roller, is hung the cylinder, with two or four spiral edges or knives,
six to ten. inches diameter, and hung on a cast-steel arbor, resting'in movable boxes attached to the sides of the frame, so as to
set the cylinder up and down from the roller, to give the thickness
of the timber to be planed. On each side of the cylindei is plact.
ed a pair of feeding-rollers, of hard wood or metal, the under one
of each pair being level with the centre one. The upper ones are
hung in boxes, which are pressed down with springs or weights, so
that when the timber comes between them, they will hug and carry
it through. These rollers are connected and turned by wheels, at
a velocity of about twelve feet surface of the roller per minute.
The cylinder with two edges to make about two thousand five hundred revolutions per minute, cutting five thousand -strokes every
twelve feet ; this can be varied according to the number of edges, power, and velocity of the different parts. The power is attached
to the cylinder by a bolt running on a pulley, on the outward end
of the cylinder shaft. -Each way from the feeding-rollers is placed rollers about two feet apart for the timber to rest on while running through. On one side of the frame is fastened a straight
edge, to serve as a guide, lined with metal ; on. the other side,
rollers are placed in a piece of timber, which is pressed up to the
plank or board to keep it close to the guide or straight edge by a
spring. The grooving and tonguing is don& by burrs or circular
cutters similar to a saw; these burrs are hung on perpendicular
spindles, the arbors of which rest in boxes attached to the inward
side of the frame, a burr on one side to cut the groove, and on the
other is placed two burrs, just as far apart as the thickness of the
above one, for cutting the groove. At or near one end of the
frame is hung a shaft, with a drum or roller, from which belts pass
over to pulleys on each spindle of. the burrs or circular cutters,
which must have about the same velocity of the cylinder. These
burrs are placed on one side of the cylinder, opposite to each
c 3*

654

Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

other, so as to cut the tongue to match the groove; on the other
side of the cylinder is an arbor parallel with the cylinder, on
which is placed circular cutters for planing the edges of the board
or plank as they pass through. The cutter on the side next to
the guide is stationary on the arbor ; the opposite one is movable
in the arbor, but fastened with screws to set it for different
widths. A belt runs from a pulley on the end of the arbor, outside the frame, to the said drum, as also the same from the cylinder, each having about the same motion. The feeding-rollers are
put ini motion by a belt from the slow -part of the driving power.
I have also put in operation a carriage for feeding, but rollers save
the time of running the carriage back.
"Now, what I, the said Uri Emmons) consider and claim as
my improvement, and for which I solicit a patent, is as follows,
namely

-

"1st. The principle of planing boards and plank with a rotary
motion, with knives or edges on a cylinder, placed upon the same,
straight or -spiral, as before described, which I put in operation at'
'Syracuse, in the county of Onondaga, in the State of New York,
in the early part of the year. 1824.
"2d. The burrs for grooving and tonguing, in contradistinction
from the mode used by William Woodwoith, he Using the duckbill cutters.
"3d. The feeding, by'running the timber through on a carriage,
or between feeding-rollers, guided by a straight edge, as before
described.
1"In testimony that the aforegoing is a true specification of my
said improvement, as before described, I have hereunto set my
hand and seal, the eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord

§ 18.) "And be it further enacted, that whenever any patentee of
an invention or discovery shall desire an extension of his patent beF
yond the term of its limitation, he may make application therefor, ih
writing, to the Commissioner of the Patent-office, setting fprth the
grounds thereof; and the Commissioner shal, on the applicant's
paying the sum of forty dollars to the credit of the treasury, as in
the case of an original application for a patent, cause to be published in one or more of the principal newspapers in the city of"
Washington, and in such other paper or papers as he may deem
proper, published in the section of country most interested adversely to the extension of the patent, a notice of such application,
and of the time and place when and where the same will be considered, that any person may appear and show cause why the extension
should not be granted. And the Secretary of State, the Commissioner of the Patent-office, and the Solicitor of the Treasury shall
constitute a board to hear and decide upon the evidence produced
before them, both for and against the extension, and shall sit for
that purpose at the time and place designated in the published
notice thereof. The patentee shall furnish t6 the said board a
statement in writing, under oath, of the ascertained value of the
invention, and of his receipts and expenditures, sufficiently in detail
to exhibit a true and faithful account of loss and profit in any manner accruing to him from and by reason of said invention. And if,.
upon a hearing of the matter, it shall appear to the full and entire
satisfaction of said board, having due regard to the public interest
therein, that it is just and proper that the term of the patent should
be extended, by reason of the patentee, without neglect or fault
upon his part, having failed to obto.in, from the use and sale of his
invention, a reasonable remuner',ion for the time, ingenuity, and
expense bestowed upon the same, and the introduction thereof into
use, it shall be the duty of the Commissioner to renew and extend
the patent, by making a certificate thereon of such extension, for
the term of seven years from and after the expiration of the term ;
which certificate, with a certificate of said board of their judgment and opinion as aforesaid, shall be entered on record in the
patent-office ; and thereupon the said patent shall have the same
effect in law as though it had been originally granted for the term
of twenty-one years. And the benefit of such renewal shall extend
to assignees and grantees of the right to use the thing patented, to

OR

Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

".0mended Specification.
"The plank or boards which are to be planed, tongued, or
grooved are first to be reduced to a width by means of circular
saws, by reducing-wheels, or by any other means. When circular
saws are used for this purpose, two such saws should be placed
upon the same shaft, on which they are to be capable of adjustinent, so that they may be made io stand at any required distance
apart ; under these the board or plank is to be forced forward, and
brou~ht to the width required; this apparatui and process do not
xequire to be further explained, they being well understood by
mechanicians.
" When what has been above denominated reducing-wheels are
used, these are to consist of revolving cutter-vbeels, which resemble in their construction and action the planing and reducing
wheel to be presently described ; these are to be made adjustable
like the circular saws, but the latter are preferred for this purpose.
The plank may be reduced to a width on a separate-.machine.
" When the plank or boards'have been thus prepared (on a separate machine), they may be placed on or against a suitable carriage, resting on a frame or platform, so as to be acted upon by a
rotary cutting or planing and reducing wheel; which wheel may
be made to revolve eithor horizontally or vertically, as may be
pieferred. The carriage which sustains the plank or board to be
operated upon may be moved forwards by means of a rack and
pinion, by an endless chain or band, by geared friction-rollers, or
by any of the devices well known to machinists for advancing a
carriage or materials to be acted upon in machines for various purposes. The plank or board is to be moved on towards the cutting edges of the cutters or knives, on the planing-cylinder, so that
its knives dr cutters, as they revolve, may meet and cut the plank
or board in a direction contrary to That in which it is made to advance ; the edges, of the cutters are, in this method, prevented
from coming first into contact with its surface, and are made to cut
.upwards from the reduced part of the plank towards said surface,
by which means their edges are *protected from injury by gritty
matter, and the board or plank is more evenly and better planed
.than when moved in the reversed direction;
"After the board or plank passes the planing-cylinder, and as
soon, or fast, as the planing-cylinder has done its work on any part
of the board or plank,- the edges. are brought into contact with two
xevolving cutter-wheels, -one of which wheels is ad4pted to the
cutting of the groove, and the other to the cutting of the two re.bates that form the tongue. When the axis of the planidg and
xeducing wheel stands vertically, the grooving and tonguing wheels
are placed one alsove the other, with the plank edgewise between

JANUARY TERM, 1846.
Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

them; when the axis of the planing-wheel stands horizontally,
these wheels are on the same horizontal plane with each other,
standing on perpendicular spindles.
"The grooving-wheel consists of a circular plate fixed on an
axis, and having one, two, three, four, or mor' cutters, which-are
to be screwed, bolted, or otherwise, attached to it, the edges of
which cutters -project beyond the periphery of the plate to such
distance as is required for the depth of the groove; their thickness
may be such as is necessary for its width ; the z are; of course, so
situated as to cut the groove in 'the middle ;r the edge of the
board, or as nearly so as mayb e required. The tonguing-wheel
is similar in form to the grooving-wheel, but it has cutters on each
of its sides, or otherwise, so formed and arranged as to cut the
two rebates which are necessary to the formation of the tongue.
"' The grooving and tonguing cutters, at the same time and by
the same operation, reduce the board or plank to an exact width
throughout. When the axis of the planing-wheelis placed vertic
cally, the knives or cutters may be made to plane two planks at
the same time ; the planks being in this case moved in contrary.
directions, and so as to meet the edges of the revolving knives or
cutters. When the machine is thus constructed, a second pair of
grooving and tonguing wheels may be made to 'operate in the
same way with those above described. A machine to operate
upon a single plank or board, and having the axis of the planingwheel placed horizontally, will however be more simple and less
expensive than that intended to operate on two planks simultaneously.
"In the accompanying drawing, fig. 1 is a perspective representation of the principal operating parts of the machine when arranged and combined for planing, tonguing, and grooving; and
when so arranged as to be capable of planing two -lanks at the
same time, the axis of the planing-wheel being placed vertically.

axis, J, bf the cylinder, or they may stand obliquely thereto, as
may be preferred ; but in the latter case the edge should form the

and pinion, H ; against this carriage, the plank K, which is to be
planed, tongued, and grooved, is placed, and is made to advance
with it. It will be manifest, however, that the plank may be moved forward by- other means, as, for example, by an endless chain
or band, passing around drums or chain-wheels, or by means of
geared friction-wheels home up against it. To cause the carriage
and plank to move forward readily, there may be friction-rollers,
fff, placed horizontally, and extending under them; the rollers,
fff, which stand vertically, are to be made to -press against the
plank and keep it close to the carriage, and thus prevent the action
of the cutters from drawing the plank up from its bed in cutting
from the planed surface upwards ; they may be borne against it by
means of weights or springs, in a manner well known to machinists. In a single h6rizontal machine, the horizontal friction-rollers
may he geared, and the pressure-rollers placed above them to feed
the board with or without the carriages, a bed-plate being used directly under the planing-cylinder,
"1Fig. 2 is a separate view of the planing-cylinder, with its knives

they are represented as furnished with four. The cutters may be
fixed on the sides of circular plates, with their edges projecting
beyond the periphery of said plate.
"The edges of the plank, as its planed part passes the planingcylinder, are brbught in contact .with the above-described tonguing
and grooving wheels, which are so placed upon their shafts as that
the tongue and groove shall be left at the proper distance from the
face of the plank, the latter being sustained against the planingcylinder by means of the carriage or bed-plate, or otherwise, so
that it cannot -deviate, hut must be reduced to a proper thickness,
and correctly tongued and grooved.

of, cutter-wheels are shown, it not being deemed necessary.to
represent those on the opposite side, they being similar in all
respects.

or boards, the bearings of the shaft or cylinder may be made movable, by screws or other means, to adjust it to the work; or the
carriage or bed-plate may be made so as to raise the board or
plank up to the planing-cylinder. E and E' are the revolving cutters, or tonguing and grooving W~heels, which are placed upon vertical shafts, having upon them pulleys, D D, around which pass
belts or bands from the main drum, 1, to which a revolving motion
may be given by any adequate motive power.
"1From the drum, I, a belt, L, passes also around the pulley,
b,on the shaft of the planing-eylinder, and gives to it the requisite
motion. There may in this machine be a horizontdl carriage
moved forward by a rack and pinion, in a manner analogous to that
represented in fig. 1; but in the present instance the plank is supposed to be advanced by means of one or two pairs of friction or
feed rollers, shown at ff'; the uppermost, f' f'P, of the pairs of
rollers may he held down by springs, or weighted levers, which it
has not been thought necessary to show in this drawing, as such
are in common-use. The lowermost of these rollers may be fluted
or made rough on their surfaces, so as to cause friction on the under side of the plank. M M; are pulleys on the axles of these
lower rollers which are embraced by bands, N N'1, which also pass'
around a pulley, 0, on a shaft which crosses the frame, A A, and
has a pulley, T, on-it, which is embraced by the belt, P, on a pulley, Q, on the shaft of the main drum, I; these bands and pulleys serve to .give motion tothe feed-rollers, as will be readily understood by inspecting the drawing. R R are guide-strips, used
in place of the rollers used for the same purpose, and also for bearing or friction rollers, when the machine is vertical, to direct one
edge of the plank, and against its opposite edge ; any pressure may
be used equal to-the weight of the board or plank, when worked in
a vertical position. One of the cutter-wheels, should be made adjustable, to idapt it to stuff of different widths.
"1The planing-cylinder, and likewise the cotter or tonguing and
grooving wheels, may be constructed in the manner represented in
figures 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and hereinbefore fully described. One
of the heads of the planing-wheel may be made movable, to accommodate ts width to the width of the boards or plank to be
planed.
" The respective pars of this machine may be varied in size, as
may also the 'velocity of the motion of the planing-cylinders and
cutter-wheels ; but th following has been found to answer well in
practice. The planing-cylinder, having four knives or cutters,
may be twelve inches in diameter, and may make two thousand and
upwards revolutions in a minute. In a machine like that shown
in fig. 7, the main drum, I, may be two feet in diameter, and
may be driven with the speed of five hundred and upwards revolutions in a minute. The pulleys on the planing-cylinder, and on the

668

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

cutter-wheels, may be six inches in diameter. The plank should
be moved forward at the rate of about one foot for every hundred
revolutions of the cutter-wheel; and, of course, the diameter of
the feed-rollers ind of the pulleys, by which they are turned must
be so graduated as to produce this result. The size and speed of.
the above parts of this machine may be in some degree varied
but the above have been found to work well.
"Having thus fully described the parts and combination of
parts, and operation of the machine for planing, tonguing, and
grooving boards or plank, and shown various modes ir.which the
same may b constructed and made to operate withobt changing
the principle or mode of operation of the machine, what is claimed
therein'as the invention of William Woodworth, deceased, is the
-employment of rotating planes, substantially such as herein described, in combination with rollers, or .any analogous device, to
prevent the boards from being drawn up by the planes when cutting
upwards, or from the reduced or planed to the ianplaned surface,
as described.
" And also the combination of the rotating planes with the cutter-wheels for tonguing and grooving, for the purpose of planing,
tonguinr and grooving boards, &c., at one operation, as described.
And afso the combination of the tonguing and grooving cutterwheels for tonguing and grooving, boards, and at one operation, as
described.
"And, finally, the combination of. either the tonguing or the

the pressure-rollers, as described, the effect of the pressure-rollers
in these operations being 'such as to keep the boards, &c., steady,
and preveni the cutters from drawing the boards towards the centre
of the cutter-wheels, whilst it is moved through by machinery. In
the planing operation, the tendency of the plane is to lift the boards
directly up against the rollers ; but in the tonguing and grooving,
the tendency is to overcome the friction occasioned by the pressure
of the rollers.

et al.

The case was argued by Mr. Seward, Jilt. -Latrobe,and .Mr.
Webster (the two latter dividing the points), on behalf of the plaintiff,
and Air. Stevens, for the defendants. The reporter has been kindly
furnished with the arguments of these gentlemen, but his limits will
not permit their publication in extenso, and he is unwilling to take
the responsibility of condensing them
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
The questions in this case come before us on a certificate of
division of opinion from the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Northern District of New York, involving the construction of
various provisions of the act of Congress to promote the progress
of useful arts, commonly called the patent act. ;We shall examine
the questions in the order in which they appear on the record.
The first is as follows :1. Whether the eighteenth section of the act of 1836 authorized
the extension of a patent on the application of the executor or ad-,
ministrator of a deceased patentee.
The eighteenth section provides, in substance- that whenever
any patentee of an invention or discovery shall desire an extension
of his patent beyond the term of its limitAtion, he may make application therefor, in writing, to the Commissioner of the Patentofice, setting forth the grounds thereof. That the Secretary of
State, the Commissioner of the Patent-office, and the Solicitor of
the Treasury shall constitute f board to hear and decide upon the
application ; the patentee shall furnish to the board a'statement in
writing, under oath, of the value and usefulness of the invention, and
of his receipts and expenditures, sufficiently in detail to exhibit a
true and faithful account of loss and profit _in any manner. accruing to him from and by reason of the invention ; and if, upon a hearing of the matter, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the board,
having a due regard to the public interest, that it is just and proper
the term of the patent should be extended, by reason of the patentee,
without neglect or fault on his part, having failed to obtain, from
the use and sale of his invention, a reasonable remuneration for the
time, ingenuity, and expense bestowed upon the same, and the introduction thereof into use, it shall be the duty of the commissioner
to renew and extend the patent, by making a certificate thereon of
such extension for the term of seven years from and after the piration of the first term, &c.
This is the substance of the section, so far as is material to the
consideration of the question ; and it will be seen, that, according to
the words of the provision, the application is to'be made by, and
the new term to be granted to, the patentee himself, and hence the
objection on account of its having been granted to the administrator.
The main argument relied on to support the objection is, that the
Vaatentee had no interest or right of property in the extended term at
E3

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau

et al.

the time of his death. That all he had was a' mere possibility,
too remote and contingent to be regarded as property, or any
right of property, in the sense of the law, and therefore not assets or rights in the hands of the administrator which would authorize an application within the meaning of the statute.
At common law, the better opinion, probably, is, that the right
of property of the inventer to his invention or discovery passed
from him as soon as it went into public use with his consent ; it was
then regarded as having been dedicated to the public, as common
property, and subject to the common use and enjoyment of all.
The act of Congress for the encouragement of inventers, and to
promote the progress of the useful arts, and for the purpose of
remedying the imperfect protection, or rather want of protection,
of this species of property, has secured to him, for a limited term,
the full and exclusive enjoyment of his discovery.
The law has thus impressed upon it all the qualities and characteristics of property, for the specified period ; and has enabled
him to hold and deal with it the same as in case of any other
description of property belonging to him, and on his death it passes, with the rest of his personal estate, to his egal representatives,
and becomes part of the assets.
Congress have not only secured to the inventer this absolute
and indefeasible interest atid property in the subject of the invention
for the fourteen years, but have also -agreed, that upon certain conditions occurring and to be shown, before the expiration of this
period, to the satisfaction of a board of commissioners, an indifferent tribunal designated for the purpose, this right of property in
the invention shall be continued for the further term of seven years.
Subject to this condition, the right of property in the second term
is as perfect, to' the extent of the intent, as the rigbh of property in
the first.
The circumstances upon which the condition rests, and the occurrence of which gives effect and operation to the -further grant
of the government, are by no means uncommon, or difficult to be
shown. They have often happened to inventers in the course of
their dealings with this species of property. The act of Congress
contemplates their occurrence again, and has therefore provided
further security and protpction, by enlarging the interest and right
of property in the subject of their invention.
The provision is founded upon the policy of the government to
encourage genius, and promote the progress,of the useful arts, by
holding out an additional inducement to the enjoyment of the right
secured under the first term; and as an act of justice to the inventers for the time, ingenuity, and expense bestowed in bringing
out the discovery, frequently of incalculable value to the business
interests of the country. And it is apparent, therefore, unless the
executor or administrator is permitted to take the place of the

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

675

Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

patentee in case of his death, and make application for the grant
of the second term, which continues the exclusive enjoyment of.
the right of property in the invention, the object of the statute will
be defeated, and a valuable right of property, intended to be secured, lost to his estate.
The statute is not founded upon the idea of conferring a mere
personal reward and gratuity upon the individual,'as a mark of distinction for a great public service, which would terminate with his
death ; but of awarding to him an enlarged interest and right of
property in the invention itself, with a view to secure to-him, with
greater certainty, a fair and reasonable remuneration. And to the
extent of this further right of property, thus secured, whatever that
may be, it is of the same description and character as that held
and enjoyed under the patent for the first term. In its nature,
therefpre, it continues, and is to be dealt with, after the decease of
the patentee, the same as an interest under the first, and passes, with
other rights of property belonging to him, to the personal representatives, as part of the effects of the estate.
It would seem, therefore, from the nature of this interest in
an extended term itself, as well as from a consideration of the object and purpose of the statute, plainly expressed upon its, face,
in providing for the prolonged. enjoyment and protection of this
species of property, that the Board of Commissioners were well
warranted in making the renewed grant to the administrator, upon
-his complying with the conditions.
An argument has been urged against this conclusion, grounded
upon the tenth and thirteenth sections of the patent law. The
former provides in express terms for the issuing of a patent to the
executor or administrator, in case of the death of the inventer before it is taken out ; and the latter, for a surrender of a patent
defective by reason of an insufficient description, and the reissuing
of a new one. These are supposed to be analogous cases, and
manifest the sense of Congress, that, without the express provisions
of law, the patent in the one case, and the surrender in the other,
could not be issued to, or be made by, the legal representative.
The argument is no doubt a proper one, and entitled to consideration ; but is not necessarily conclusive.
As it respects the provision for a surrender by the executor or
administrator, which is most analogous to the question in hand, w9
think there could be no great doubt that the r;ght would exist in
the absence of any such express authority, regar, being had to the
nature of the property, and the rights and duties of the legal representative, within the spirit and object of the patent law. It
would be the surrender of a patent, the legal interest and property
in which had become vested in him as part of the assets, which he
was bound to take care of, and protect against waste ; a step
nocessary to perfect the title and give value to the property

6"

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

would seem to be not only directly within the line of hisduty, but
in furtherance of the chief object of the law, namely, to secure
remuneration to the rheritorious inventer.
It has also been argued, that the executor or administrator could
ndt comply with the terT? and conditions of the eighteenth section,
upon which the right of property in the extended term is made to
depend. In other words, that he would be unable to furnish to the
Board of Commissioners a statement under oath of the usefulness
of the invention, and of the receipts and expenditures of. the
patentee, ekhibiting a true and faithful account of the loss and
profit in any manner accruing from, and by reason of, the invention.
This argument assumes as a matter of fact that which may well be
denied. Suppose the dealings of the patentee in the subject of
his discovery have been carried on through the instrumentality of
agents or clerks, or, if not, that the patentee himself, as business
men usually do, has leept an accurate account of his receipts and

books of a deceased party, in many of the States of the Union,
identified and the handwriting proved, are received as 'legal evidence of the demand in the courts of justice, and afford full aiithority, upon legal principles, for the admission of the books before
the board, in support of the application. We perceive, no great
difficulty in a substantial compliaftce with the terms of the section,
on the part of the executor or administrator.
The second question is, Whether, by force and operation of the
eighteenth section already referred to, the extension granted to
W. W. Woodworth, as administrator, on' the 16th day of November, 1842, inured to the benefit of assignees under the original patent granted to William Woodworth, on the 27th day of December, 1828, or whether said extension inured to the benefit of the
administrator only, .i his said cap~ity.
The most of this section has already been recited in the consideration of the first question, and it will be unnecessary to re'peat it.
It provides for the application of the patentee to the commission for
an extension of the patent for seven years ; constitutes a board to
hear and decide upon the application; and if his receipts and expenditures, showing the loss and profits accruing to him from and
on account of his invention, shall establish, to the. satisfaction of the
board, that the patent should be extended by reason of the patentee, without any -fault on his part, having failed to obtain from
the use and sale of his in vention a reasonable remuneration for his
time, ingenuity, and expense bestowed upon the same, and the introduction of it into use, it shbLl be the duty of the commissioners
to extend'th6 same by makifig a certificate thereon of such 'extension for the term of seven, years from and after the first term ;
"-and thereup6n the said patent shall have the same effect in law
is though it had been originally granted for the term of twenty-one

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

'"ndthe
years." And than comes the clause in question:
benefit of such. renewal shall extend to assignees and grantees of the
right to use the thing patented, to the extent of their respective interests therein."'
The answer to the second question certified depends upon the
true construction of the above clause respecting the rights of assignees and grantees.
Various and conflicting interpretations have been given to it by
the learned counsel, on the argument, leading to different and opposite results, which it will be necessary to examine.
On one side, it has been strongly argued, that the legal operation
and effect of the clause save and protect all the rights and interests
of assignees and grantees in the patent existing at the time of the
extension ; and thus secure and continue the exclusive use and enjoyment of these rights and interests for the seven years, to the
sarie extent, and in as ample a manner, as held add enjoyed under
the first term. That if A. holds an assignment of a moiety of the
patent, he will hold the same for the new term of seven years.; if
of the whole patent, then the whole interest for that period. And
that as soon as the new grant is made to the patentee,'the interest
therein passes, by operation of this clause, to the assignees of the
old term, in proportion to their respective shares.
On the other side, it has been argued, with equal earnestness,
that, 'according to the true construction and legal effect of the clause,
protection is given, and intended to be given, only to the rights and
interests of assignees and grantees acquired and held by assignments
and grants from the patentee in and under the second or new term ;
and that it does not refer to, or embrace, or in any way affect the
rights and interests of assignees or grantees holding under the old.
In connection with this view, it is said that the .rights thus protected in the new term may be acquired by means of the legal
operation of the clause, either from a direct assignment or grant
after the extension of the patent, or by an appropriate provision for
that purpose, looking to an extension,'contained in the assignment
or grant un
the old.
It is not tb be denied, but that, upon any view that has been
taken or that may be taken of the clause, its true meaning and legal
effect cannot be asserted with entire confidence ; and, after all,
must depend upon such construction as the court can best give to
doubtful phraseology and obscure legislation, having a due regard
to the great object and intent of Congress, as collected from the
context and general provisions and policy 6f the patent law.
The rule is familiar and well settled, that, in 'case of obseui'eand
doubtful words or phraseology, the intention of the law-makers is
to be resorted to, if discoverable fiom the context, in order to fix
and control their meaning so as to reconcile it, if possible, with
the general policy of the law.

e7S

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson

v. Rousseau et aL

Now, the serious difficulty in the way, and which renders the
first iterpretation inadmissibley except upon the most explicit and
positive words, is, that 'it subverts, at once the whole object and
purpose of the enactment, as is plainly Written in every line of the
previous part of the section. It gives to the assignees and grantees
of the patent, as far as assigned under the old'term, the exclusive
right and enjoyment of the invention -

the monopoly - in the ex-

tended term for the seven years ; when, by the same provision, it
clearly appears that it was intended to be secured to the patentee
as an additional remuneration for his time, ingenuity, and expense
in bringing out the -discovery,' and in introducing it into public use.
It gives this remuneration to parties that have no peculiar claims
upon the government or the public, and takes it from those who
confessedly have.
The whole structure of the eighteenth section turns upon the
idea 6f affording this additional protection -and compensation to the
patentee,' and to the. patentee alone, and hence the reason for instituting the inquiry before the grant of the extension, to ascertain
whether or not he has failed to realize a reasonable remuneration
from the sale and use of the discovery, - the production of an account of profit and loss to enable the board to determine the question ; and as it comes to the one or the other conclusion, to grant
the extended term or not.
It'is obvious, therefore, that Congress had not at all in view
protection to assignees. That their condition on acbount of dealmg in the subject of the invention, whether successful or otherwise,
was not in the mind of that bVody, nor can any good reason be
given why it should have been.
They had purdhased portions of the interest in the invention, and
dealt with the patent rights'as a matter of business and speculation;
and stood in no 4ifferent relation to the government or the public,
than other citizens 'engaged in the common affairs of life.
Nothing short of the most fixed and positive terms of a statute
could justify an interpretation so repugnant to the whole scope and
policy of it, and to wise and judicious legislation.
We think this construction not necessarily required by the language of the clause, and is altogether' inadmissible.
Then as to the second interpretation, namely, that the clause
refers to, and includes, assignees and grantees of interests acquired
in the new term, either by an assignment or grant from the patentee
after the extension, or by virtue of a proper clause for that purpose,.
in the assignment under the old term.
Th3 difficulty attending this construction lies in the uselessness
of the clause upon the hypothesis, - the failure tb discover any
subject-matter upon which to give reasonable operation and effect
to it,- and hence, to adopt the construction is to make the clause

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

679

Wilson v. Rousseau et a].

virtually a dead letter, the grounds for which conclusion we 'wl
proceed to state.
The eleventh section of the. patent act provides, that every patent shall be assignable, in law, either as to the whole interest, or
any undivided part thereof, by an instrument in writing.; which assignment, and also every grant and conveyance of the exclusive
right under any patent, &c., shall be recorded in the patent-office.
And the fourteenth section authorizes suits to be brought in the
name of the assignee or grantee, for an infringement of his rights, in
a court of law.
One object of these provisions found in the general patent system
is to separate the interest of the assignee and grantee -from that
which may be held by the patentee, and to make each fractional"
interest held under the patent distinct and separate ; in- other
words, to change a mere equitable into a legal title and interest, so
that it may be'dealt with in"
a court of law.
Now, in view of these provisions, it is difficult to perceive th1
materiality of the clause in question, as it respects the rights of assignees and grantees held by an assignment or grant in-and under
the new term, any more than in respect to like rights and interests
in and under the old.
The eleventh and fourteenth sections embrace every assignment
or grant of a part or the whole of the interest in the invention, and
enable these parties to -deal with it, inall respects, the same as the
patentee. The'y stand upon the same footing, under the new term,
as in the case of former assignments under the old. Nothing can
be clearer. It is--impossible to satisfy the clause by referring
it to these assignments mfnd grants ; or to see how, Congress could,
for a moment, have imagined that there would be any necessity for
the clause, in this aspect of it. It would have been as clear a
work of supererogation as can be stated..
The only color for the argument in favor of the necessity of this
clause, in the aspect in wich we are viewing it, is as respects the
contingent interest in the new term, derived from a provision in an
assignment under the old one, looking to the extension. As the
right necessarily rested on contract, at least till the contingency occurred, there may be some doubt whether, even after its occurrence, the eleventh and fourteenth sections had the effect to change
it into a vested legal ierest, so that it could be dealt with at law ;
and that a new assignment or grant from the patentee would be required, which could be enforced only in a court of equity. To
this extent there may be some color for the argument, - some supposed matter to give operation and effect to the clause.
But what is the amount of it ? Not that the clause creates or
secures this contingent interest in the new term, for that depends
upon the contract between the parties, and the contract alone,
and which, even if the general provisions of the law respecting

680

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

the rights of assignees and grantees could not have the effect to
change into a legal right, might be enforced in a court of.equity.
The oly effect, therefore, of the provision in respect to assignees and grantees of this description would be, to change the nature
of the contingent interest after the event happened, from a right
resting' in contract to a vested legal inteiest ; or, to speak with
more precision, to remove a doubt about the nature of the interest
in the new term, after the happening of a certain contingency,
which event in itself was quite remote. This seems to be the
whole amount of the effect that even ingenious and able counsel
have succeeded in' finding, to satisry the clause. It presupposes
that Congress looked to this scintilla of interest in the new term,
which might or might not occur, and cast about to provide for it,
for fear of Houbts as to its true nature and legal character, and
the effect of the general system upon it.
We cannot but think a court should hesitate before giving a construction to the clause so deeply harsh and unjust in its congequences, both as it respects the public and individual rights mnd
interests, upon so narrow a foundation.
But there are other difficulties in the way of this construction.
The eleventh section, regulating the rights of assignees and grantees, provides, "that every patent shall be assignable at law," &c.,
"which assignment, and also every grant and conveyance of the
exclusive right under any patent to make and use, and to grant to
others to make and use, the thing patented within and throughout
any specified part or portion of the United States," &c., "shall be
recorded."
Now it will be apparent, we think, from a very slight examination
of the clause in question, that it does not embrace assignees or
grantees, in the sense of the eleventh section, at all ; nor in the
sense in which they are referred to when speaking of these interests generally under the patent law, without interpolating words
or giving a very forced construction to those composing it.
The clause is as follows:
"And the benefit of such renewal
shall extend to aisignees and grantees of the right to use the thing
patented, fo the extent of their respective interests therein."
It will be seen that the word "exclusive," used to qualify the
right of a grantee in the eleventh section, and, indeed, always when
referred to in the patent law (§ 14), and also the words " to make,"
"1and to grant to others to rnake and use," are dropped, so that there
is not only no exclusive right in the grantee, in terms, granted or
secured by the clause, but no right at all, -no right whatever, - to
make or to grant to others to make and use the thing patented ; in
other words, no exclusive right to make or vend. -And it is,' we
think, quite obvious, from the connection and phraseology, that
assignees and grantees are placed, and were intended to be placed,
in this respect,- upon the same footing. We should scarcely be

JANUARY

TERM, 1846.

Sal

Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

justified in giving to this term a more enlarged meaning as to the
right to. make and sell, as it respects the one class, than is given to
the others, as they are always used as correlative in the patent
laws, to the extent of the interests held by them. The clause,
therefore, in terms, seems to limit studiously the benefit, or reiervation, or whatever it may be called, under or from the new grant
to the naked right to use the thing patented ; not an excluive right
even for that, which might denote monopoly, nor any right at all,
much less exclusive, to make and vend. That seems to :have
been guardedly omitted. We do not forget the remaining part of
the sentence, "to the extent of their respective interests therein," •
which is relied on to help out the difficulty. But we see nothing
in the phrase, giving full effect to it, necessarily inconsistent with
the plain meaning of the previous words. The exact ide- intend
ed to be expressed may be open to observation ; but we thirk it
far from justifying the court in holding, that the grant or reservation
of a right to use a thing patented, well known and in general use at
the time, means an exclusive right to make and use it; and not
only this, but an exclusive right to grant to others th*e right to:
make and use it, meaning an exclusive right to vend it.
The court is asked to build up a complete monopoly in the hands
of assignees and grantees in the thing patented, by judicial construction, founded upon the grant of a simple right to use it to the
extent of the interest possessed ; for the argument 'com6s to this
complexion. A simple right to use is given, and we are asked to
read it an exclusive right, and not only, to read it an exclusive right
to use, but an exclusive right to make and vend, the patented
article.
Recurring to the patent IaV, it will be seen that Congress, in granting monopolies of this description, have deemed it necessary to
use very different language. The grant in the patent must be in
express terms, for "the full and exclusive right and liberty of
making, using, and vending," in order to confer exclusive privileges. The same language is also used in the act when speaking
of portions of the monopoly in the hands 'of assignees and gratees.

(§§ 11, 14).
We cannot but think, therefore, if Congiess had intended to
confer a monopol# in the patented article upon the assignees and
grantees by the clause in question, the usual formula in all such
grants would have been observed, and that we ghould be defeating
their understanding and intent, as well as.doiiig violence 'to the language, to sanction or uphold rights and privileges of such magnitude by the mere force of judicial construction.
We conclude, therefore, that the clause has no reference to the
rights or interest of assignees and grantees under the new and extended term, upon the ground, 1. ,Because, in that view, giving to the words the widest conVOL. Iv.
86

struction, there is nothing to.satisfy the clause, or upon which any
substantial effect and operation can be given to it; it becomes virtually a dead letter, and work of legislative superfguity; and
2. Because the clause in question, upon a true and reasonable
interpretation, does not operate to vest the -aspignees and grantees
named therein with any exclusive privileges whatever, in the extended term, and therefore cannot be construed as relating to or
embracing such interests in the sense of the law.
The extension of the patent under the eighteenth section is a new
grant of the exclusive right or monopoly in the subject of the invention for the seven years. All the rights of assignees or grantees, whether in a share of the patent, or to a specified portion of
the, territory bld under it, terminate at the end of the fourteen
years, and become reinvested in the patentee by the new grant.
From that date be is again possessed of "the full and exclusive
right and liierty of making, using, and vending to others the invention," whatever it may be. Not only portions of the monopoly
held by assignees and grantees as subjects of trade and commerce,
but the patented articles or machines throughout the country, purchased for practical use in the business affairs of life, are embraced within the operation of the extension. This latter class of
assignees and grantees are reached by the new grant of the exclusive right to use the thing patented. Purchasers of the machines,
and who were in the use of them at the time, are disabled from
further use immediately, as that right became vested exclusively in
the patentee. Making and vending the invention are prohibited by
the corresponding terms of his grant.
Now, if we read the clause in question with reference to this
state of things, we think that much of the difficulty attending it will
disappear. By the previous part of the section, the patentee would
become reinvested with the exclusive right to make, use, and vend
the thing patented ; and the clause in question follows, and was so
intended as a qualification. To what extent, is the question. The
language is, "And the benefit of such renewal shall extend to assignees and grantees of the right to use the thing patented, to the
extent of their respective interests therein" ; naturally, we think,
pointing to those who were in the use of the patented article at the
time of the renewal, and intended to restore or save to them that
right which; without the clause, would have been vested again exclusively in the patentee. The previous part of the section operating in terms to vest him with the exclusive right to use, as well as to
make and vend, ther6 is nothing very remarkable in the words, the
legislature intending thereby to qualify the right in respect to a certain -class only, leaving the right as to all others in the patentee,
in speaking of the benefit of the renewal extending to this class.
The renewal vested him with the whole right to use, and therefore there is no great impropriety of language, if intended to pro-

JANUARY TERM, 1846.
Wilson v. Rousseau

683

et al.

tect this class, by giving them in terms the benefit of the renewal.
Against this view it may be said that " the thing patented" means
the invention or discovery, as held in McClurg v. Kingsland, 1
How. 202, and that the right to use the 1 thing patented " is what,
in terms, is provided for in the clause. That is admitted, but the
words, as used in the connection here found, with the right simply
to use the thing patented, not the exclusive right, which would be
a monopoly, necessarily refer to the patented machine and not to
the invention.; and, indeed, it is in that sense that the expression
is to be understood generally throughout the patent law, when taken in connection with the right i6 use, in contradistinction to the
right to make and sell.
The "thing patented" is the invention ; so the naacliine is the
thing patented, and to use the machine is to use the invention, because it is the thing invented and in respect to which the exclusive
right is secured, as is also held in McClurg v. Kingsland. The
patented machine is' frequently used as equivalent for the " thlug
patented," as well as for the invention- or discovery, and no doubt-,
when found in connection with the exclusive right to make and
vend, always means the right of property in the- invention, the
monopoly. But when in connection with the simple right to use,
the exclusive right to make and vend being in another, the right to use
the thing patented necessarily results in a right to u~e the machine,
and nothing more. Then, as to the phrase "to the extent of their
respective interests therein," that obviously enough refers to their
interests in the thing .patenjed, and in connection with the right
simply to use, means .their interests in the patented machines, -be'
that interest in one or more at the time of the extension.
This view of the clause, which brings it down in practical effect
and operation to the persons in the use of the patented machine or
machines at the time of the new grant, is strengthened by the clause
immediately following,, which is, "1that no extension of the patent
shall be granted after the expiration of the term for which it was
originally issued." What is the object of this provision ? Obviously, to guard against the injustice which might otherwise occur to
a person who had gonQ. to the expense of procuring the patented
article, or changed his business upon the faith of'using or dealing
with it, after the monopoly had expired, which would be arrested
by thb.operation of the new grant. To avoid this donsequence, it
is provided that the extension must take place before the expiration
of the patent, if at all. Now, it Would be somewhat remarkable if
Congress should, have been thus careful of a class of persons who
had merely gone to the expense of providing themselves with
the patented article for u~e or as a matter of trade, after th e
monopoly had ceased, and would he disappointed and exposed to
loss if it was again renewed, and at the same time had overlooked
the class who in addition to this expense and change of business

684

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson r. Rousseau et al.

had bought the right from the patentee, and were mithe use and
enjoyment of the machine, or whatever it might be, at the time of
the renewal. These provisions are in juxtaposition, and we think
are but parts of the same policy, looking to the protection of individual citizens from any special wrong and injustice on account of
the operation of the new grant.
The consequences of any different construction than the one
proposed to be given are always to be regarded by courts, when
dealing with a statute of doubtful meaning. For between two different interpretations, resting upon judicial expositions of ambiguous
and involved phraseology, that which will result in what may be regarded as coming nearest to the intention of the legislature should.be
preferred.
We must remember, too, that we are not dealing with the decision of the particular case before us, though that is involved in the
inquiry'; but with a general system of great piactical interest to thle
country ; and it is the effect of our decision upon the operation of
the system that Vives to it its chief importance.
The eighteenth section authorizes the renewal of patents in all
cases where the Board of CommisNioners is satisfied of the usefulness of the invention, and of the inadequacy of remuneration to the
patentee. Inventions of merit only are the subject of the new
grant ; such as have had the public confidence, and which it may
be presumed have entered largelyi in one way and another, into the
business affairs of life.
By the report of the Commissioner of Patents it appears, that five
hundred and two patents were issued in the year 1844, - for the last
fourteen years, the average issue yearly exceeded this number, -and
embrace articles to be found in common use in every department
of labor or art, on the farm, in the workshop, and factory. These
articles have been purchased from the patentee, and hive gone into
common use. But, if the construction against which we have
been contending should prevail, the moment the patent of either
article is renewed, the comm(.a use is arrested, by the exclusive
grant to the patentee. It is true the owner may repurchase the
right to use, and doubtless would be compelled from necessity ; but
he is left to the discretion or caprice of the patentee. A construction
leading to such consequences, and fraught with such unmixed evil,
we must he satisfied, was never contemplated by Congress, and
should not be adopted unless compelled by the most express and
positive language of the statute.
The third question certified is, whether the extension of the
patent granted to W. W. Woodworth, as administrator, on the 16th
of November, 1842, inured to the benefit of the administrator exclusively, or whether, as to certain territory specified -in the contract'
of assignment made by W. Woodworth and James Strong to Toogood, Halstead, and Tyack, on the 28th of November, 1829, and

JANUARY. TERM, 1846.

685

Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

by legal operation" of the covenants contained in said contract, the
said extension inured to the benefit of said Toogood, Halstead, and
Tyack, or their assigns ?
William Woodworth was the original patentee, and took out
letters patent on the 27th of December, 1828 ; and soon after conveyed a moiety of the same to James Strong. One- Uri Emmons
also obtained a patent for a similar machine on the 25th of April,
1829, and soon after conveyed all his interest in the same to Toogood, Halstead, and Tyack. With a view to avoid litigation, both
parties mutually assigned to each other their interests in the respective patents to different and separate portions of the United States ;
and in the assignment from Woodworth and Strong to Toogood,
Halstead, and Tyack,'the following covenant was entered into by
the parties. "And the two parties further agree, that any improvement in the machinery, or alteration, or renewal of eitherpatent, such improvement, alteration, or renewal shall inure to the
benefit of' the respective parties interested, and may be applied
and used within their respdctive districts, as herein before designated."
. At the time this covenant was entered into, there was no provision in the patent laws authorizing an extension or renewal of the
same beyond the original term of fourteen years. The first act
providing for It was passed in July, 1832. Before this time, the
only mode of prolonging the term beyond the originaf grant was by
means of private acts of Congress upon individual applications. •
A construction bad been given by the Circuit Court of the
United States, in New York, as early as 1824, by -which the
patentee, on surrendering his patent on account of a ,defective specification, would be entitled to take out a new patent correcting the
defect, which construction was afterwards upheld by this court in
Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 218, and the principle since ingrafted into the patent law by the act of 1832.
The court is of the opinion, that the covenant in question should
be construed as having been entered into by the parties, with a
reference to the known and existing rights and privileges secured to
patentees under the general system of the government established
for that purpose ; that the parties would naturally look to the established .system of law on the subject in arranging their several
rights and obligations, in dealing with property of this description,
rather than to any possible change that might be effected by private
acts of Congress upon individual application. Contracts are usually made with reference to the established law of the land, and
should be so understood and construed, unless otherwise clearly
indicated by the terms of the agreement. If the parties in this case
contemplated any alteration or modification of their rights, more
advantageous, by the further legislation of CongresS, we think- some
more specific provision having reference to it should have been
VOL. IV.

P3

686

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

inserted in their covenant. The term renewal may be satisfied by
a reference to the law as it then stood. The patentee might surrender his patent, and take out a new one, within the fourteen years;
and the term was used, probably, to guard against any question that
might be raised as to the right under the assignment in the new patent, if a surrender and new issue should become necessary. The
specification accompanying the patent was a complicated one, and
has been the subject of much controversy, and the necessity of a
surrender for correction and amendment might very well have been
anticipated.
We think thbi view satisfies the use of the term, and that no right
is acquired in the new grant by virtue of the assignment or covenant.
The fourth and fifth questions certified are answered by the opinion of the court upon the first and second questions.
The sixth question certified is as follows : - Whether the plaintiff, if he be an assignee of an exclusive right to use two of the
patented machines within the town of Watervliet, has such an exclusive right as will enable him to maintain an action for an'infringement of the patent within the said town ; or whether, to maintain
such action, the plaintiff must be possessed, as'to that territory, of
all the'rights of the original patentee.
The plaintiff is. the grantee of the exclusive right to construct
and use,'and to vend to others to be used, two of the patented machines within the town of Watervliet, in the county of Albany.
The fourteenth section of the patent law authorizes any person,
who is a grantee of the exclusive right in a- patent within and
throughout a specified portion of the United States, to maintain an
action in his own name for an infringement of the right.
The plaintiff comes within the very terms of the section. Although limited to the use of two machines within the town, the right
to use them is exclusive. No other party, not even the patentee,
can use a right utider the patent within the territory without infringing the grant.
The seventh, question certified'is as follows --Whether the
letters patent of renewal issued to W. W. Woodworth, as administrator, on the 8th of July, 1845, upon the amended specification
and explahatory drawings then filed, be good and valid in law, or
whether the same be void for uncertainty, ambiguity, or multiplicity
of claim, or any other cause.
The court is satisfied, upon an examination of the specification
and drawings referred to in the question certified, that it is sufficiently full and explicit, and is not subJect to any of the objections
taken to it.
The remaining questions will be sufficiently answered by the certificate sent to the court below.

. Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record'from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of New York, and on the points and questions on
which the judges of the said Circuit Court were opposed in opinion,
and which were certified to this court for its opinion, agreeably to
the act of Congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel: On consideration whereof, it is the opidion of
this court, 1. That the eighteenth section of the patent act of 1836 did authorize the extension of a patent on the application of the executor
or administrator of a deceased patentee.
2. That, by force and operation of the eighteenth section of the
act of July 4th, 1836; entitied " An act to promote the progress,
of the useful arts," &c., the extension granted to William W.
Woodworth, as administrator, on the 16th day of November, 1842,
did not inure to the benelit-of assignees under the original patent
granted .to William Woodworth on the 27th day of December,
1828, but that the said dxtension inured to the benefit of the administrator only, in his said capacity.
3. That the extension specified in the foregoing second point did
inure to the benefit of the'administrator, to whom the same was
granted, and to him in that capacity exclusively ; and that, as
to the territory specified in the contract of assignment made by
William Woodworth and James StrQng to Toogood, Halstead,
and Tyack, on the 28th day of November, 1829 fand set forth in
the second plea of the defendants to the first count of the declaration), and by legal operation of the covenants contained in said
contract, the said extension did not inure to the benefit of the said
Toogood, Halstead, and Tyack, or their assigns.
4. That the plaintiff, claiming title under the extension from the
administrator, can maintain an action for an infringement of the patent right within the territory specified in the contract of assignment
to Toogood, Halstead, Ehd Tyack) against any person not claiming
under said assignment. And that the said assignment is not, of itself, a perfect bar to the plaintiff's suit.
5. That the extension specified in the second point could be applied for and obtained by William W. Woodworth, as administrator of William Woodworth, deceased, although the said William
Woodworth, the original patentee, had in his lifetime disposed of
all his interest in the then existing patent, having at the time of his
death no right or title to or interest in the said original patent ; and
that such sale did not carry any thing beyond the term of said
original patent ; and that no contingent rights remained in the patentee or his representatives.
6. That the plaintiff,.if be be an. assignee of an exclusive right

688

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

to use two of the patented machines within the town of Watervliet,
has such an exclusive right as will enable him to maintain an action
fo? an infringement of the patent within said town.
7. That the letters patent of renewal issued to William W.
Woodworth, as administrator as aforesaid, on the 8th day of July,
1845, upon the amended specification and explanatory drawings
then filed, are good and valid in law ; and are not void for uncertainty, ambiguity, or multiplicity of claim, or any other cause.
8. That the question involved in the eighth point propounded
does not present any question of law which this court can answer.
9. That the decision of the Board of Commissioners, who are to
determine upon the application for the extension of a patent under
the eighteenth seetion of the act of 1836, is not conclusive upon
the question of their jurisdiction to act in a given case.
10. That the C6mmissiolner of Patents can lawfully receive a surrender of letters patent for a defective specification, and issue new
letters patent upon an amended specification, after the expiration
of the term for which the original patent was granted, and pending the existence of an extended tbrm of seven years ; and that
such surrender and renewrl may be made at any time during such
extended term.
It is thereupon now here ordered and adjudged by this court,
that it be so certified to the said Circuit Court.
Mr. Justice McLEAN.
As I dissent from the opinion of the court, in their answer to
to the second question certified, I will state, in few words, the
reasons, of my dissent.
The question is, whether the extension of the patent, under the
act of 1836, to William W. Woodworth, the administrator, inured
to the benefit of the assignees of the first patent.
I had occasion to consider this question in the cas" of Brooks
and Morris v. Bicknell and Jenkins, on my circuit, and on a deliberate examination of the eighteenth section of the above act, I
came to the conclusion, that unless the assignment gave to the assignee the right in the extended or renewed patent, his interest expired with the limitation 6f the original patent.
The lamented Justice" Story, without any interchange of opinion
between us, about the same time, gave the same constkuction to the
section. The late Mr. Justice Thompson, and several of the district judges of the United States, blqve construed the act in the
satie way.
The eleventh section of the act makes the patent assignable in
law, either as to the whole interest or any undivided part thereof,
by any instrument of writing, which is required to be recorded in
the patent-office within three months from the date.
By the eighteenth section, the patentee may make application

or the extension of his'patent to the Cbmmissioner, who is required
to publish a notice of such application "in one or more of the
principal newspapers in the city of Washington, and in such other
paper or papers'as he may'deaen proper, published in the section
of country most' interested adversely to the extension of the patent." " And the Secretary of State, the Commissioner of the
Patent-office, and the Solicitor of the Treasury shall constitute a
board to hear and decide upon the evidence produced before them
both for and against the extension, and shall sit for that purpose
at the time and place designated in the published notice thereof.
The patentee shall furnish to said board a statement in writing,
under oath, of the ascertained value of the irvention, and of his
receipts and expenditures, sufficiently in-detail to exhibit a true and
faithful account of loss and profit in any mdnner accruing to him
from and by reason of said invention. And if, upon a hearing
of the matter, it shall appear to the full and entire satisfaction of
the said board, having due regard to the public interest therein,
that it is just and proper that the term of the patent should be extended by reason of the patentee, without neglect or fault on his
part, having failed to obtain, from the use and sale of his invention,
a reasonable remuneration for the time, ingenuity, and expense bestowed upon the same, and the intioduction thereof into use, it
shall be the duty of the Commissioner to renew and exterid the patent," &c. ; "and thereupon the said patent shall have the same
effect in law as though it had been originally granted for the term
of twenty-one years. And the benefit of such renewal shall extend
to assignees and grantees of the right to use the thing patented,
to the extent of their respective interest therein."
This section embraces patents previously issued, and the construction now to be gi'ven to it operates on all cases of Pxtensions
under it, whether the assignments were made before or after the
passage of the act.
The object of this section is so clearly expressed as not to admit
of doubt. It was for the exclusive benefit of the patentee ; for
the extension can only be granted when it shall be made to app6ar
that the patentee, "1without neglect or fault on his part, having
failed to obtain, from the, use and sale of his invention, a reasonable remuneration for his time, ingenuity, and expense," &c. This,
thea, being the clear intent of Congress, expressed in this section,
it must have a contr6lling influence in the construction of other
parts of the section. A statute is construed by the same rule as a
written contract. The intent of law-makers, and of the persons
contracting, where'that intent clearly appears, must be carried into
effect. Where the statute or the contract is so repugnant in its
language as not to show the intent, then no effect can be given to
it. If the words used be susceptible of such a construction as
VOL. iv.

87

C

F3*

690

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson V. Rousseau et al.

not only to show the intent, but to enable the court to give effect
to it, it is the duty of the court so to construe it.
Bacon, on the construction of statutes, says,-" The most natural
and genuine way of construing a statute is to construe one part by
another part of the same statute ; for this best expresseth the
meaning of the makers." And,-- If any part of a statute be obscure, it is proper to consider the other parts ; for the words and
meaning of one part of a statute frequently lead to the sense of
another.?' " A statute ought,, upon the whole, to be so construed,
that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be
superfluous, void, or insignificant."
That the patentee may have his patent extended, though the assignee held the entire interest in it, is undoubted. He has only to
show that he has not been reimbursed, &c., within the meaning of
the section, to establish his claim for an extension. And, in such
a case, if the benefit of the extension go to the assignee, hd having
the entire interest in the patent, how is the patentee benefited ?
And yet the law was enacted exclusively for his benefit. Does
not such a construction defeat the object of the law ? And if it
does, can it be maintained ? Where the assignment of the patent
has, been for, less than the whole, the same objection lies, though
the object of the law is subverted only to the extent of the assignment.
The interest of the assignee, it is supposed, is protected by the
provision, that " the benefit of such renewal shall extend to assignees and grantees of the right to use the thing patented, to the
extent of their" respective interest therein." There can be no
doubt that the words, "4to the extent of their respective interest
therein," refer to their right to use the thing patented.; and this, it
is contended, is the benefit which results to the assignee from the
renewal. That this would seem to be the import of. these words,
disconnected from other parts of the section, is adimitted; but such
a construction is wholly inadmissible, when the object of the section is considered.
The patent is extended for the benefit of the patentee. This is
so obvious that no one will deny it. And the above construction
gives the benefit to the assignee. Here is a direct repugnancy,
and there is no escape'from it; for the same repugnancy, exists,
though in a less degree, where a pbrt of the patent only has been
assigned. Under such circumstances, we must inquire whether this
-repugnancy may not be avoided by giving a.nother and a different
application to the provision, of which the words may be susceptible.
The benefit of the renewal is given to the assignees; but to
what extent ? - to the extent of their interest in the' renewal.
But it is said, that this cannot be the true construction, as it renders
the provision inoperative. If, by the assignment, there was an ex-

691

press contract th.t the assignee should enjoy the same interest in
the renewal oi~extension of a patent, this would secure such interest,
without the provision.
To this it may be answered, that such an assignment of a thing
not in esse would, at most, only be a contract to convey the legal
right. But, under the eighteenth section, the assignment after the.
extension becomes a legal transfer. In addition 'to this, the right
under the extension being legal, all purchasers would be affected
with notice, where the assignment had been recorded in the patentoffice. This view gives effect to the section, and harmonizes its
provisions. The other construction makes the parts of the section
repugnant, and nullifies the whole of it. Now, which is the more
reasonable .view ? But, in addition to this, what conceivable motive could Congress have had to give a boon -to the assignee ?
How is he injured by the extension ?
Without the extension, the assignee wquld only have a right, in
common 'with all others, to use the invention. This could be of
no more value to him than the worth of his machinery - for competition equally open to all cannot be estimated of any value.
Under the assigi ment, the assignee claims a monopoly. Now, did
Congress intend to give him this boon ? Why should he be an
object of public munificence ? He laid out his money in the purchase of the patent right, because he believed it would be profitable. And, in most cases, the assignee speculates upon the poverty
of the inventer. Inventers are proverbially poor and dependent.
The history of this patent illustrates strongly this fact. Half of
the right was originally assigned to pay the expense and trouble of
taking ouf the patent. Another part of the patent was assigned to
compromise a pretended claim to a similar invention.
The hardship complained of by the assignee is more imaginary
than real. If the patentee takes all the benefit of the extension,
the assignee loses, it is said, the value of his machinery. This
does not necessarily follow. For if the machinery has been judiciously selected, and put in operation at a propir place,-it will sell
for its value generally, if not always. If the invention be of great
value, as is undoubtedly the case in this instance, the machinery
will be wanted by any one who may wish to bontinue the business,
under the extended patent. So that the loss in the sale of the machinery would not be greater than would have been suffered by a
sale if the patent had not been extended.
This construction, then, inflicts little or no injury on the assignee, whilst the other construction, as his- been shown, defeats
the object of the statute. But this inconvenience or loss to the
assignee is duly considered and weighed, under the statute, as the
board, in granting the extension, must have a due regard to the
public interest. Notice is to be given, as far as practicable, to all
persons interested against the extension of the patent, who may

2SUPREME

COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau

et al.

appear before the board and oppose it. And it was stated in the
argument, that the assignees of this patent did oppose the extension of it. Little did they suppose at the time that they were resisting a boon secured to them by the above section. Whatever
loss, real or imaginary, the assignee may suffer from the extension
of the patent, is a loss or inconvenience whioh results from the
general advancement of the public good, and for which society
does not, arid indeed cannot, make compensation. The price of
property is affected by general legislation. An embargo is laid,
and ships, during its continuance, are valueless. The increase or
diminution of the tariff affects beneficially or injuriously the value
of machinery used in manufactures. The reduction of the price
of the public lands affects the price of lands generally in the new
,States. An act authorizing a company or individual to construct
a railroad renders useless turnpike roads in its neighbourhood,
and the public honses established thereon; but for these injuries
no compensation is made. Indeed, it is difficult to find any great
public enterprise which does not, in a greater or less degree,
afectinjuriously private rights. But these must yield to the general welfare of society.
All enlightened governments reward the inventer. He is justly
considered a public benefactor. Many of the most splendid productions of genius, in literature and in thearts, have been conceived
and elaborated in a garret or hovel. Such results not only enrich
a nation, but render it illustrious. And should not their authors
be cherished and rewarded ?
If the assignee- under the eighteenth slection take any tiling, in
my judgment he takes the whole extent of his interest, - the
whole or nothing. And it appears to me the construction given
by the court is, if possible, less warranted by the section, than to
hold that the assignee takes under the extension the entire interest
assigned.
The words, "and the benefit of such renewal shall extend to
assignees and grantees of the-right to use the thing patented, to the
extent of their respective interest therein," cannot, it seems to me,
by any known rule of construction, be held to give to the assignee
or grantee the right to use the machine he may have had in operation at'the tinle the ,extension took effect. The words, "to use
the thing patented," are descriptive of the ,right assigned or granted, and refer to such right, not to the mere use of the machine.
"The extent of their respective interest therein" undoubtedly
covers the whole interest, and cannot refer merely to the number
of machines the individual may have in uperatiun.
Mr. Justice WAYNE -expressed" his dissent from that part of
the opinion of the court which, in answer to the second question, gave a right to an assignee to continue the use of the patent-

ed machine, and said he would probably file his reasons with the
clerk.
Mr. Justice WOODBURY.
There is one of the leading questions certified to us in this
cause, in the decision of which I have the misfortune to differ from
a majority of the court.
As that decision bears on several of the other questions, and also
disposes entirely of some of the four causes connected with this
matter, which have been so long and so ably under argument before us, I consider it due to the importance o.f this subject to the
parties and the public, as well as just to myself, to state the reasons for my dissent.
The difference in our views arises in the construction of the
eighteenth section of the patent law of July 4th, 1836, and relates
to the benefits which may be enjoyed under it by assignees and
grantees.
Before the passage of that law, a patent could not, under any
circumstances, be- extended in its operation for the benefit of any
body beyond its original term, except by a special act bf Congress.
But this section allowed a patentee to apply to a board of officers
and obtain from them a renewal of' his patent for seven years
longer, provided he offered to them satisfactory proofs that his expenses and labor in relation to the patent had not beqn indemnified. It -provided further, that, the renewal be indorsed on the
back of the original patent; "1and thereupon the said patent shall
have the same effect in law as though it had been originaly granted for the term of twenty-one years." It then added, " And the
benefit of such renewhl shall extend to assignees and grantees of
the right to use the thing patented, to the extent of their respective
interests therein." This last clause creates the chief embarrassment. In this case, the patentee having' died, and we having just.
decided that a renewal was legally granted to his administrator, the
controverted question about which we differ is, whether that renewal inures exclusively to the use of the patentee throughhis administrator, or goes either in full or in part to his assignees and grantees under the old patent. In the present case it is conceded, that
by the contract of asignent or grant, nothing is expressly conveyed but th6 old. patent, and in words i only for the original term'
of" fourteen years. I
The question is'not, then, whether, when assighing an interest
in the old term, before- or after the passage of the act of 1836,
it might not be compefent end easy to use language broad and explicit enough to tiansfer an interest in any subsequent extension by
means of the contract of assignment, and this be confirmed by the
words of the eighteenth section ; but whether tho e words alone
transfer it, or were intended to transfer it, when the contract of as-

694,

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

signment, as in this case, was made before the act of 1836 passed,
and referred, eo nomine, only to the old patent, and expressly limited the time for which the patent was assigned to the old term.
In such case, it seems to me that both the language and spirit of
this section restrain its operation to the patentee or his legal representatives, and convey no rights in the extension to assignees or
grantees, whether prior or subsequent, except where the patentee
-had clearly contracted that they should have an interest beyond the
original term.
But the majority of the court hold here, that this clause, independent of any expression in the assignment, transfers an interest
in the extension to all assignees and grantees, so jhat they may
continue to use any machines already in operation during the new
term, without any new contract, or any new compensation for such
farther use.
The argument on the part of the assignees, in all the cases before us, on this subject, has been, that by force of this section all
assignees before authorized to make, vend, or use these machines,
for fourteen years, could continue to make and vend, as well as
use them, for seven more, without any new contract or new considerations; and that "grantees of the right to use" should have a
like progngation of all their interests. And such seems to have
been the opinion of the Circuit Court in Maryland, in Wilson v.
Turner, October term, 1844, Chief Justice Taney presiding,
though other points besides arose there, and were disposed of in
that opinion.
But now, for the first time, it is believed, since the passage of
the patent law, this court, by force of the last clause in the eighteenth
section, not only give to assignees and grantees a greater or
longer interest ii the thing patented than was given in the contract
of assignment to them, but undertake to introduce a novel discrimination, not seeming to me to be made in the clause itself, and give
to assignees of the patent right itself an extension of only a part of
their former interest, hut to "1grantees of the right to use" the
patent, an extension of all their former interests.
We propose to examine the objections to this decision of the
court, first, on the principle of giving to old assignees and grantees
an extension of their interests to the new patent at all, unless the
contract of assignment to them was manifestly meant to embrace
any new term.; and, after that, to examine the propriety of the
discrimination in. allowing a right in the renewed patent to grantees
of the use, to the extent of all theii old -interests) and withholding a
like privilege from assignees of the patelit itself.
First, it has beeh repeatedly decided, that "a thing which is in
the letter of a statute is ndt within the statute, unless it be within
the intention of the makers." Dwarris on Statutes, 692 ; Bac.
Abr. Statute.T; 2 Instit. 107, 386.

TERM, 1846.

Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

Here the great design of the whole section was to extend asaistance to an unfortunate and needy class of men of genius, who bad
failed to realize any profits from thqir valuable inventions during the
first term of their patents. The-intention of the makers of this law
is usually conceded to have been reliuf to such patentees, and not to
assignees or grantees.
*It was the former, and not the latter, rwhO were sufferers, and
whom Congress had before, by special acts of extension, occasion ally tried to indemnify for their losses ; and to whom now, in a more
summary way, on application and proof by them alone, an extension
was'authorized to be'given by a board of officers, in order that they
and not others might reap the profits of such extension.
But, by allowing the benefit of it io go to. the former assignees of
only the old patent, the intentiQn of the. makers appears -.to -be
defeated, and those profited who have not provied any loss or suffering, but, on the contrary, may have already derived great 'advantages from the assignment.
It might thus happen, likewise, wherej in a case like this, the
patentee has assigned all his old patent before the extension, and
the use of it under the extension would constitute all or its chief
value, that neither he nor his representatives - he whose genius had
produced the whole invention, at the sacrifice of tirhe and toil, and
whose sufferings, losses, and disappointments the law is expressly
made to indemnify- would receive the smallest pittance from it; but
those reap all its- advantages who may already have grown-rich by
the assignment to them of the old pa.ent, and who nobody can pretend were the particular or principal objects of relief. -Undersuch
a construction, how absurd would it be for such a' patentee ever to
apply for an extension, when he must' do it at new cost and expense, .and then have the whole fruits of it stripped from him by
persons who had neither paid for the extension, n6Y had it conveyed to them. It is an equal violation of the leading intention of
this section, and of most of these principles and of much of this reasoning, to allow, as the opinion of the court does, such persons to
take, unpaid for and unbought, a part of the benefits of the renewal,
as to take the tohole of them.
Secondly, by the construction of the court, contracts and vested
rights seem tobe radically encroached upon. Under it, an assignee of
an old patent, limited, in the contract conveying it to fourteen years,
will, for some purposes, get it for twenty-one years, directly in conflict with the express stipulation of the pfarties. Congress will, in
this way, be made unworthily to tamper with the private obliga-.
tions of individuals, and will impair them by taking from the rights
of one, and enlarging or adding to the rights of the other ; and this
without any new consideration or new engagement passing between
them, but, on the contrary, against the wishes, assent, and interests
of one. That view, also, involves us in the unreasonable.inference,

696

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

that Congress intended to violate a solemn compact, to, disturb the
vested rights and written agreements of parties, when the 4language
used is susceptible of a different construction, and one that is consistent with what is just, and with the spirit of the whole section.
By that view, an assignee or grantee will obtain " a right to use
the thing patented" for a term of seven years longer than he contracted or paid for, while the patentee, without any such agreement in his
contract assigning or granting the right to use, and without any new
consideration, will be deprived of all his new and vested rights in
the extension, so far as regards that use, and will have his former
contract impaired -virtually in its whole vitality, by making him part
with the use for a term of twenty-one years, when the contract'says
but fourteen, and making him do it, also, without any application by
others for the extension, any proof by others of not being indemnified, any payment by others of the costs and expenses for procuring the additional seven years, and when the avowed and cardinal object of the renewal was to indemnify him alone for losses which
he and not others had sustained. Well may he say, as to these
new aid extended interests attempted to be conferred on assignees
and grantees beyond the contract of assignment, in hcec federa non
tenj.
Thirdly, the construction I contend for seems to me the only
one consistent with the language used in the latter portioMl of the
eighteenth section. By this, no part of those troublesome" four
lines is senseless, or expunged, or ungrammatical, or contradictory
to the object of the previous portion of the section. While the
construction opposed to this must, in my-view, require interpolations
or extirpations of wordsand a violation of the object of the-rest of
the section, in order to give to the clause the meaning the advocates
orthat construction impute to it. Look at the phraseology of the
clause.

"

I The benifit of such renewal shall extend to assignees and

grantees of the right to use the thing patented, to the extent of their
respective interests therein," but surely to no more than that extent.
It would violate both the words and design* to have them enjoy
more than the extent of their interesis therein, quite as much as not
to let them enjoy all of the extent of them. In the construction of
statutes it is a well settled axiom, that, "to bring a case within the
statute, it should be not only within the mischief contemplated by
the legislature, but also within the 'plain, intelligible. import of the
words of the act of parliament." Brandling v. Barrington, 6 Barp.
& Cresw. 475. In this case the assignees and grantees were not
within either the mischief intended to be remedied, that is, a want of
indemnity for losses by the patentee.; or within the "plain; intelligible- import of the words," as their contract of assignment or grant
did not extend to the renewed term at all,'for any purpose whatever,
but was expressly-limited to the fourteen years of the original patent:
.There must be some measure, of their respective interests, when

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

the act passed. What was it ? Clearlk, the contracts undar
which they had been acquired. Nothing had been done, either
in other acts or previous portions of this, to increase those interests beyond the contracts, but merely to enable assignees and grantees of exclusive rights to protect them by suits in their own
names, The present clause, also, does not profess to -increase
those interests, but simply to let assignees and grantees enjoy them
under the renewal, if by their extent by the contract which
limits and defines them they run into the extended term. Various
hypotheses and metaphysical refinements have been resorted to
for the purpose of putting'a meaning on the words of this clause
differing from this, which is so plain and so consistent with the
spirit of the section ; and virtually making it provide, that assignees and grantees shall have more benefits under the renewal in the
thing patented than the " extent of their respective interests
therein."
But before testing more critically the extent of those interests
by the only standard applicable to them, it will be necessary to
consider separately the true meaning of two of the words. employed
in this clause, namely, " renewal" and "1therein."
Much research has been exhibited, in attempting to draw distinctions in this case between the words renewal 'and extension.
But I am not satisfied that any exist, when these words are employed as in this act of Congress, or in contracts relating to this
subject. It'is true, that some "renewals" are not "1extensions,"
in the sense of prolonging the term of the patent, - that is, when
an old patent is surrendered and a new one taken out, or a renewal
made for the rest of the term, - while all extensions prolong the
term. But still 1 r e n ew al s " are as often used for a prolongaition
of the term, or for a new term, ad extensions are, and in this very
section, "1to renew and extend" is used as if synonymous, and
this in sound analogy to the use of the word renewal on several
other subjects. Thus, tor renew a lease is to extend it another
term. To renew an office is to extend it another term. To
renew griefs, revocare dolores, is to extend them. Again; the
second 1 t h ere i n , " at the close of the clause, has been considered
by some as meaning", in tl~e renewal," and by- others, "in the
right to use," and by others still, "in the thing patented." But,
grammatically, it refers to the " thing patented," and hence "c the
interests therein" are "1the interests in the thing patented."
Phillips tteats it as a matter of course to mean "in the patent,"
and uses that as synonymous to "1therein," and thouh, in regard
to my construction of the whole ciuse, the result is much the
same, whether "therein " is considered to mean in "the thing
patented," or "the patent," or "the renewal," yet I incline to the
first view of it as that most strictly grammatical and the most natural, as well as coming nearest to the views of this court in
VOL. IV.

SUPJ EME COURT.
Wilsoia v. Rousseau et al.

M'Clurg v. Ringslan=4,'
How. 210. Further objections to
its meaning "in the right to use "will be. stated hereafter, under
anoiher bead. Passing, then, to a more careful scrutiny of the
whole clause, it would seem, that there could be but one rational
test of "the extent' of the interests of assignees and grantees
in the thing patented, and that such test must be the previous con,tract 'of assignment or grimt. under which alone they hold any
interests.
If that contract grants to them one f6urth or one half of the.
old patent, or the use of it in one State or county, and for a term
of five years, or ten, or fourteen, from the issue of the patent,
then such and such alone is the extent of their interests, and they
will not run into the new term. But if the contract goes further,
and grants one half or all of' the old patent to assignees, and for a
term not only of fourteen years, but twenty-one years, or any number to which the patentee may afterwards become entitled by any
extension or new grant, then such is the extent of their interests,
and they will in such case rin into the new term. This view gives
meaning and spirit to every word, and excludes or alters none.
This, too, conforms to the 'design of the section in taking away
no part of the benefit intended to be conferred by it on the patentee, unless' he has chosen to dispose of it clearly and 'deliberately, and 'receive therefor, either in advance or after actually
granted, such additional consideration as he deemed adequate and
contracted to be sufficient.
If after the word "extent "' in this clause, there had been added,
what is the legal inference, bothi in time and quantity, this meaning
might have been still more clear to some. But without those
words, the extent of interest seems to me to depend as much on
the length of time the patent is granted to the assignee, as on the
dimensions of territory over which he may use it, or the proportion of the whole patent he is authorized to use. It -is like a leasehold interest in land, or a grant 6f it. The extent of interest
by such a grant of land is more or less, as the term -is shorter or
longer, quite as much as if the land conveyed is more' or less, in
quantity.
The word 1 extent," in common parlance, varies somewhat in
meaning, according to the subject to which it is applied, and as
that changes, it may as well refer to time as to space, or proportion ; and more especially so, when applied to interests, as in
patents, for a particular term of years.
There is another analogy in support of this view, that has not
been urged in the ingenious arguments offered, but has struck me
with some force. A patent was the description once applied to
commissions for office; and the records of this court at first
speak of the commissions of the judges as patents.
Now what is the extent of inteiest the incumbent has in any

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

6099

Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

office under his commission or patent ? Clearly, in part, the length
of'time it is to run, whether four years, during good behaviour,
or for life, and in part only its yearly profits ; often quite as
much depending on that length of time, as the amount of the
salary or fees annually attached to the office.
What is the chief objection in reply to all this ? Nothing, except
that thb assignee could get protected t0 the extent of his interest,
in this view, by the contract alone, without the aid of the provision
at the close of the eighteenth section, and hence that the provision
is in this view unnecessary or nugatory, and must havd been inserted for some other purpose. But were it in reality unnecessary,
that would not require us to consider it as intending something
different from its words, or different from the previous contracts of
the parties. Legislatures often add clauses to acts, which do not
prove to be in reality necessary, but are inserted from abundant
'caution and to remove future doubts or litigation. So, in this
very act; in the eleventh section, it is declared, that a patent may
be assigned. Yet this is'probably unnecessary, as an-interest like
that of a patentee can of course be assigned, on common law principles, without the aid of a statute.
When we look; however, to another circumstance, - that, though
a contractof assignment would, without any clause in the statute, pass
the interest to the assignee, yet it would not -enable him to sue in
his own name, - we can discover another reason for this provision
still more effective. A clause had been inserted in a previous part
of the act to enable the assignee to sue in his own name on the old
patent, if violated ; and, probably in doubt whether such provision
would be- extended to assignees under the renewal, when h4aving any
interest therein, it was provided firther, that I"the benefit of the renewal" should reach them to the extent of their interests therein,
a part of which benefit would be to sue in their own name for any infringement on their rights to it, as fully as they could do for a violation of their rights in the original patent, and as if that had been for
twenty-one years. The provision thus would be far from nugatory, by clearly conferring on them every power and privilege to
sue under the extension which they possessed under the original
patent.
By means of this provision, also, in another view, the condition
of the parties might be changed, from a reliance on a contract
alone that they should have a certain interest in the new patent,
to a vested interest in' it ; or, in another view still, from an executory to an executed right.
There is, in the construction given by some of the majority of the
court to the clause immediately preceding this, another.ample reason for inserting such a provision.
The previous clause, stating, that "thereupon the said patent shall
have the'same ieffect in law as though it had been originally granted for

700

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

the term of twenty-one years," would, it is argued, if the section,
had there ended, have conferred on any assignee or grantee of the
old patent, or any part of it, the extended term, so as to enable
them to use the patent as if it originally 'had been granted for
twenty-one years instead of fourteen.
Suppose, then, for a moment, that this construction was considered by Congress proper, or only possible, it is manifest that the
additional clause which follows had a second and most pregnant
object, - no less than to prevent that consequence, so hostile to the
design of inserting the whole section,- io grant an extended term for
the benefit and indemnity of the patentee, and not of the assignee.
In this view, the lasi clause might well be added, as a limitation on
what would otherwise be the inference from that just preceding
it ; and might well declare, instead of this inference, that assignees
of the old patent should not hold it, in "all cases, as if originally
granted for twenty-one years, though patentees might ; but that assignees should hold only in conformity to "the extent of their respective interests "1in the thing patented. In other words, if by
contract they had acquired clearly an interest for twenty-one years,
they should hold for that time ; but if by contract they had acquired
an interest for only five orfourteen years, they should hold it only
to that extent. This is rational, consistent with the great object
of the section, and gives new and increased force and necessity to
the clause. The assignees would then, after the renewal, hold
the patent for all the time they had stipulated, and for all they had
paid, but for no more.
It will be perceived, that very few assignees or grantees, prior to
the passage of the act of 1836, would in this view be likely to
come under this provision, and be benefited by it; because, not
knowing that any future law would pass allowing an extension,'
very few would be likely to anticipate one, and prqvide in their
contract and pay- for a contingent interest in its benefits.
This would make the provision, in practice, apply chiefly to future
assignees, who, knowing that such a provision existed, might be willing to give something for a right to any extension which might ever
take place under it ; and therefore might expressly stipulate in the
assignment for that right. Indeed, the arguments on the part of the
patentee in this case have mostly proceeded on the ground that this
provision was intended to apply solely and' exclusively to future assignees. Cdnsideing that any other construction is in some degree
retrospective, and that this would give force to the provision, as
well as preserve the spirit of the section, I should be inclined to
adopt it, if mine did not produce a like effect, and was not alike free
from objection, as limited by me : because I do not make the provision retrospective except in cases where the parties had expressly
contracted that the prior assignee should receive the benefit of any
extension, and in that case it has the preference in its operation

701

JANUARY TERM, 1846.
Wilson V. Rousseau et al.

over the other view, as it carries into effect that express compact,
and does not cramp the force of it to the future alone, where the
language and the consideration are equally applicable to past engagements of this character.
This conclusion is also strengthened by being in harmony with all
the leading rules of donstruction applicable to statutes, while that
adopted by the court seems, to my mind, to violate some of the
_most important of them.
Beside those already referred .to, it is well settled, that "if a
particular thing be given or limited in the preceding parts 'of a statute, this shall not be taken away'or altered by any subsequent general ivords of the same statute." Dwarris, 658 ; Standen v. The
University of Oxford, 1 Jones, 26 ; 8 Coke, 118, b. Here a particular benefit ifi, by the former part of the eighteenth section, conferred on a patefitee, for reasons applicable to him alone ; and yet, in
this case, by the opposite construction, a few general words towards
the, close are construed so as in some respects to destroy entirely
all those benefits to the patentee ; and that, too, when the language
is susceptible of a different construction, more natyral and perfectly
consistent with the previous particular grant to-the patentee.
Some collateral considerations have been urged in support of
the conclusions of the court on this branch of the c6nstruction,
which deserve notice. On a close scrutiny, they appear to me
to am6ra to less in any respect than is supposed, and in some particulars strengthen the grounds of dissent. Thus, it has been said
that the English act of the 5th and 6th of William the Fourth,
passed September 18th, 1835, was before Congress in 1836, and
was intended to be copied or adopted ; and as, under that, assignees have been allowed to participate in the extended time, it
has been argued that such was the intention here. But it is doubtful whether. that act was before the committee when they reported
the bill in 1836, as the intervening time had been short, and the
eighteenth section, on examining the journals and files, appears
not to have been in the hill at all as originally introduced, or as
originally reported ; but was afterwards inserted as an amendment
in the Senate. The consideration of this section, therefore, does
not seem to have been so full as- of the rest of the bill ; and it is
very far, in language, from being a copy of the English act. Assignees are not named at all in that'act ; and though, in extensions
under it, assignees have in tivo or three cases been allowed to participate, it has only been where an enlarged equity justified it,
as where the patentee consented, or was to receive a due share in
the benefits, or had clearly conferred a right in the extension by the
assignment ; and where, also, the assignees are expressly named in
the new grant or patent as entitled-to a share of it. See Webster's
Patent Cases, 477.
There, also, an assignee, under like circumstances, would doubt-

G3*

less benefit by the renewal, under its ordinary operations ; and the
practice in England, thus limited, will fortify rather than weaken
the construction I adopt of the6rue design of the last clause in our
own law.
. There is much, also, in, another-collateral consideration here,
which does not apply in Great Britain, and which restricts conferring the benefit of an extension, or an extension itself. on an assignee by or under any-statute, if it goes beyond what a patentee
had himself contracted to d6.
Here the Constitution limits the powers of Congress to give patents to inventers alone.
" The Congress shall have power to promote the progress of
science and the useful arts, by securing, for limited times, to authors
and inventers, the exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries." - Article I., § 8.
No authority. is conferred to bestow exclusive rights on others
than "authors and inventers " themselves.
- Hence a patent could not probably be granted to an assignee,
nor an extension bestowed on one, independent of the assent or
agreement of the patentee, or of its inuring to his benefit, without
raising grave doubts as to its being a violation of the Constitution.
But so far as inventers have expressly agreed that; assignees shall
be interested in their patents, or in the extensions of them, the latter
may well be protected ; and so, as far as administrators represent the
inventer or patentee, when deceased, ihe grant to them is substantially a grant to the inventer, As the benefit then inures to his estate and heirs. But to grant an exclusive right to an assignee
would confer no benefit on the patentee, or his estate ; and it
would violate the spirit as well as letter of the Constitution,
unless the inventer had himself agreed to it, and had substituted
the assignee for himself by plain contract, whether foe the original
term or any extension of it.
Cases have been cited in this country, likewise, where Congress,
in ten or twelve instances, have renewed patents to the inventers ;
but they have never done it to assignees. And though in two out
of the whole, which were renewed after the term had expired and
the assignees and the public were m the free use of the patent,
some limitations have been imposed on requiring further payments
from the assignees for the longer use of the old patent ; yet in
these only, and under such peculiar circumstances, has it been done,
and in these no term was granted by Congress directly to the assignee rather than the patentee ; and this limitation or condition in
favor of the assignee, in the grant to the patentee, is of very questionable validity, unless it was assented to by the patentee. In this
case it is most significant of the views of Congress tb relieve the
patentee rather than assignees, that by a special law, passed February 26th, 1845, they have conferred on the representative of the

TERM, 1846.

Wilson V. Rousseau et al.

original patentee still another term of seven years, without mentioning the assignees in any way, and without any pretence that the
benefits of this extension were designed for them.
The argument, that the assignee is sometimes a partner, and
makes liberal advances, furnishes -a good reason, in a pecuniary
view, why an assignment should be made to, him of such an interest
in the old patent as will indemnify him, but furnishes none for giving
him, even if'he regards money above public spirit or benevolence,
more *an an indemnity; or for giving him a benefit in any renewal, 'hich it has never been agreed he should have, and for
which he never'has paid.
So the reasoning, that the assignee stands in the shoes or in the
place of the patentee, and represents him, and therefore should
bave an interest in the'extension, appliei very-well, so far as he is
assignee, or so far ag the contract extends. But he no mor6 stands
in the shoes of the patentee beyond the extent of his contract,
than an entire stranger does. Such are the cases of Herbert v.
Adams, 4 Mason, 15, and that cited in 1 Hawk. P. C. 477,
'note.
In one, the assignee of the old patent represented the patentee
as to that, and that only ; and in the other, where by law a further
copyright was authbrized inall cases, and the patentee assigned his
whole interest, the second term passed also ; because the law hadpreviously given it absolutely, without contingency or evidence of
losses, but in connection with, or appurtenant to, the first copyright.
Again, it has been urged that the assignee shpuld have the benefit of the extensi6n ; otherwise he may have made large expenditures, in preparing for a free use of the patent after the original
term expires, and will loose them in a great degree, or be obliged
to pay largely for the continued use of the patent. But this same
reasoning
applies equally well to the whole world as to the assignee ; because
any individual, not an assignee, may have incurred
like expenditures in anticipation of the expiration and free use of
the old patent. In fact, the argument is rather a legislative than
judicial one, and operates against the policy of the whole section,
rather than the construction put on the last clause.
But- the hardship to any person, in such case, is more apparentthan real. The price.to he paid for the new patent is not so much
as the gain by it, and hence those who have proposed to use it and
do use it after the extension, and pay anew for a new or further
term, gain rather than loose, or they, would have employed the old
machinery in operation before this invention.
Nor is it-any relief to the community at large, as seems by some
to have beda argued, to hold that the renewal, or a large part of it,
vests in the'assignee and grantee ratheor than in the patentee. For
the great mass of the people must still pirchase the patent, or the

704

SUPREME COURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

right to- use it, of some one, and must pay as much for it to the assignee as to the patentee.
Finally, the construction of the court, by conferring any privilege whatever on assignees and grantees beyond the extent of their interests in the thing patented, when those interests, as in this
case, were expressly limited in thp -contract to the term of the old
patent, goes, in my view, beyond the language of the act, beyond
the contract of assignment, beyond- the consideration paid for only
-the old term, and beyond any intention in the legislature for relief
or indemnity to others than unfortunate patentees.
I feel not a little fortified in these views on the case, by several
decisions and opinions that have heretofore been made, in substantial conformity to them. Indeed, independent of opinions in some
of the actions now before us (from which an appeal has been taken,
or the cause has come up on a certificate of division), every reported
case on this subjebt has been settled substantially in accordance
with these views. See Woodworth v. Sherman, and Woodworth
v. Cheever et al., Cir. Ct. for Mass., May Term, 1844, decided
by Justice Story-; Van Hook v. Wood, Cir. Ct. for New York,
October Term, 1844, by Justice Betts ; Wilson v. turteis &
Grabon, Cir. Ct. for Lauisiana, by Justice McCaleb; Brooks &
Morris v. Bicknell et al., Cir. Ct. for Ohio, July Term, 1,844, by
Justice McLean (Western Law Journal, October, 1845) ; Butler's opinion, as Attdrney-General, in Blanchard's case (Opinions
of Attorneys-General, pp. 1134 and 1209).
All that remains for me is to advert a moment to that branch of
the construction adopted by the majority of th court, which, after
giving to both assignees and grantees a benefit in the new patent or
term beyond "-the extent of their interesis" under the contract
of assignmelit, undertakes to go still farther, and make a discrimination between assignees and grantees, as to the enjoyment, under
the renewal, of their different original interests. It gives to the
latter, the grantees, by the mere force of this last clause in the
eighteenth section, the enjoyment of all their old interests during
the whole of the new term; but it gives to the former, the assignees, the enjoyment of only abbut a third portion of their old
interests during that ierm. In other words, it gives to " grantees
of the right to use the thing patented " a continuance of all their
interests ; but to assignees, whose interests extended to the right
to make and to vend, as well as use, the thing patented, a continuance of only a part of theirs. In such a discrimination, uncountenanced and unwarranted, as it seems to me, by either the words
or the spirit of the act of Congress, I am sorry to find another
strong ground of dissent to the opinion of the court. The act
does not say, as is their construction, that " the benefit" of only
"the right to use the thing patented " shall extend to any one,
whether an assignee or grantee ; but that the benefit of the re-

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

705

Wilson v. Roussead et al.

newal shall extend to both, "to the extent of their respective interests," though differing clearly in extent as they do, and as willsoon be more fully shown.
"Judges are bound to take the act of parliament as the legislature have made it." 1 D. & E. 52, and Dwarris on Statutes,
711.
But the words in this act, " the right to use the thing patented,"
must be transposed, and other words altered in their ordinary meaning, to make these a description of the interests conferred. They are now a description of one kind of purchasers, that is
"grantees of the right to use the thing patented," to whom the
renewal should extend, if they had stipulated for any interests therdin by their contracts. The clause refers to two-classes, who may
in such case be benefited by the renewal. " Assignees" are one
class, and "grantees of the right to use the thing patented" are the
other class. This accords with the language itself, and also
with the punctuation of this clause, as examined by me in manuscript on file in the Senate, and as printed by the State department,
having no comma or other pointing in it except after the word
"patented."
It accords, too, with what is well understood to be
the fact, that assignees and grantees usually constitute two distinct
classes of purchasers, the former being those who buy a part or, all
of the patent right itself, and can protect their interests by suits in
their own name; and the latter being those who buy only "the
right to use the thing patented," and generally, except where the use
is exclusive (fourteenth section), cannot institute suits in their own
name for encroachments upon it. In th face of -this, to hold that
assignees and grantees mean the same thing here, and that the
words " of the right to use the thing patened" apply equally to
both, is a departure from the above established usage in employ*ng
those terms, and gives a different meaning to them from what is.
previously twice given in this very act. 'Thus in the eleventh section
an "assignment" is mentioned as one thing, and "a grant and conveyance of the exclusive right,?' &c'., as another, and in the fourteenth section, "assigns " are spoken of as if 'one class, bod
"grantees of the exclusive right," &c., as if another. And why
does the conclusion to this clause say "to the extent of their respective interests therein," if such assignees and' grantees as to patents
were- not in this very clausb considered by.Congress as having different interests, axnd that these- were to be protected according to
their respective extents ? It would have said, and mast be made
to say, if sustaining the construction of the court, "to the extent
of that right," or " to the extent of that interest," and there stop.
Manifestly, then, there is not conferred on these two classes, by
this clause, either in its spirit or in totidem veris, merely "the
right to inse the thing patented," but on the contrary', "the benefit
of the renewal," "to the extent of their respective interests in the'

Wilson v. Rousseau et al.

thing patented." The interests of the grantees may be limited to
the use, and those of the assignees -may not be, but include the
tight to make and vend as well as use ; yet large or long as may be
the interests of either, the benefit of the renewal is to cover them,
if the extent of them, under the original assignment or grant, reached
to the new term. One is not to have the whole of his iiterest6
protected and the other a-part only, when their equities are the
same. But the assignee is to have to the extent of his, which is to
make, vend-, and use ; and the grantee only "of the right to use"
is to have to the extent of his.
This, to my apprehension' is unquestionably the substance of
what Congress has said on this topic; and yet it is only by supposing'new language not in the' act, or by transposing some of the
old, -so as notv to be in: harmony with the original structure of the
sentence, or by giving a meaning to words different from what hls
Been established and, in my view, only by doing this, that any
foundation can be laid in suplort-of this part of the construction approved by the court. But "it is safer," said Mr. J. Ashurst,
"1to adopt what the legislature have actually said, than to suppose
whaf they meant to say.". 1ID.& E. 52 ; 6 Adolph. & Ellis, 7.
It may be well, also, not to forget, that it is always more judicial,
and less like legislation, to adhere to what Congress have actuallysaid3,
and that it is more imperative to do this when by adhering to it yov
carry out, as in this case, the manifest intention of the previous part
of the section. Nor can the inconsistency produced by the con-struction of the court be without influence in creating doubts as to
its correctness ; as by it "the . benefit of the renewal" will be extended to assignees and grantees not in a ratio with "their respective interests," -the words of the law, - nor in conformity to their
respective contracts, nor according to the respective considerations
they have phid, nor in proportion -to the respective losses thty
have sustained, but, under the same general permission as to the
extent of the 1 respective interests" of both, one class will be allowed to the full extent of his previous interests, and the other io
only a part of that extent.
By what authority, let me respectfully ask, is this general permission thus divided, and in one class or case limited and in the other
not ? By what legal authority are assignees cut off from a vauable
portion of their interests in a patent, while grantees to use the thing
patented are allowed to exercise the whole of theirs, and both
under one and the same general permission, covering all 1 their
respective interests "? To make this discrimination, and allow to one
class the full exteqt of their interests and to the other not the full
extent of theirs, when the law says it shall be "to the extent of
their respective interests," and when their respective contracts and
equities show that this should include both the duration and quantity
of their interests, looks like a. distinction in a great degree arbitrary,

et al.

and not a little in conflict with the plain words and design of the act
of Congress.
But, beside this further departure from what seems to me the
obvious meaning of the eighteenth section, caused by this branch of
the construction of the court, it will fail, I fei4r, as any compromise
of the difficulties arising undir this section, if any compromise be
expected from it. It is not likely to avert ruin from most of those.
indigent inventers, who have in their distresses resorted for aid to
the delusive provisions of that section. Their very necessities and
embarrassments, which are the justification for granting the renewal
to them, have usually. forced them to sell and assign all the original
patent, as was the case with Woodworth'in this instance ; and if
in such circums-arfces the law is to strip them of all benefits under
the renewal, and, Aithout any contract -to that effect, confer those
benefiti on the assignees and grantees of the old patent, the law is
perfectly suicidal as to the only design to be effected by its bounty.
But if, seeing this, the construction is modified, as here, by the
court, so as to deprive the patentee in such cases of only the benefits of the use of his old patent or old machines during the new
term, this qualification in the operation of the law will, it is apprehended, usually prove a mere mockery, working, in most cases, as
fully as the court's construction without the qualificalion would,
the entire defeat of the laudable object of the renewal towards
patentee$. In one or.two of the cases now-before us, the patentee,
nider, this construction, will still be subjected to defeat and burdensome costs. In relation to its effect on the present patent as
a whole, all,the consequences cannot now be ascertained. But it
is admitted, that the iiiv#nter had assigned the whole of the old
patent, so that no right whatever to use will remain in his representatives to dispose of; or if a right remains where ma~hines are
not now in ictual use, probably enough are now in use to supply
for some time the public wants in most parts of the United States.
The right to continue to use them will probably last during the
whole seven years the renewal runs, as the machine will usually,
with proper repairs, do serice beyond that time. It will not,
t1*f, be very difficult to calculate what value, during the seven
years, will be dejived from the right to make and vend machines,
when the use of others already in existence is scattered over
every section of the country, and they may be employed all the
time of the extended patent, without the assignees or grantees ever
having paid or being obliged to pay a dollar for that extended use.
Looking, then, to the beneficent design of the eighteenth section, to enforce the Constitution, by advancing science and the arts,,
and protecting useful inventions, through the security for a longer
teli to men of genius of a property in their own labors, in cases
where they had not been already remun'erated for their time and
expenses, I cannot but fear that the construction given by the ma-

708 ,

SUPREME tCOURT.
Wilson v. Rousseau et at.

jority of the' court will prove most:.iufortunate. It will tend to
plunge into still deeper embarrassmeit and destitution, by losses in
litigation and by deprivation of a further extended sale of their inventions, those whose worth and poverty induced Congress to
attempt to aid them.
Nor would a different construction tie up, as some suppose, the
future use of numerous, patents. Of the fourteen thousand five
hundred and twenty-six heretofore issued, since the Constitution
was adopted, I am enabled, by the kindness of the Commissioner
of Patents, to state, that only ten have been renewed tinder the
eighteenth section during nearly ten years it has been in operation.
And if the individuals'who u2e the improved machines, the fruit
of the toil and expense and science of others, were obliged in but
one case in a year, over the whole country, to pay something for
that further use, is it a great grievance ? They are not obliged
to employ the patent at all, and will not unless it is better by the
amount they pay than what was in use before. And is it d, great
hardship or inequitable, where they are benefited by another's talents, money, and labor, to compensate him in some degree therefor ?
While other countries, and Congress, and our State courts are
adopting a ino~e liberal course yearly towards such public benefactors as inventers, I should regret to see this high tribunal pursue a
kind of construction open tothe imputation of an opposite character, or be supposed by any one to evince a feeling towards patentees which belongs to other ages rather than this (and which .I am
satisfied is not cherished) as if patentees were odious monopolists of the property and labors of others, when. in truth They are
only asking to be protected in the enjoyment and sale of their own,
as truly their own as the wheat grown by the farmer, or the.
wagon built by the mechanic.
Nor should we allow any prejudices against the utility of patents
generally, and much less against the utility of the invention now
under consideration, to make our constructions more rigid in, this
case. The settled doctrine of the courts now, under the lights of
longer experience; though once otherwise, is in doubtful cases to
incline to constructions most favorable to patentees. Grant et al.
v. Raymond; 6 Peters, 218; 1 Sumner, 485 ; Wyeth i. Stone,
1 Story's Rep. 287 ; Blanchard v. Sprague, 2 Story's Rep. 169.
Nor is it strange that this should be the case-in the nineteenth century, however different it was some generations ago, when we daily
-witness how the world has been benefited since by the patented
inventions and discoveri~s in steam, in all its wonderful varieties
and utilities, and in cleani.ig, spinning, and weaving cotton by machinery for almost half the human race, and in myriads of other'
improvements in other things, shedding so benign a light over th.
age in which we live, and most of them excited and matured only

under the protection secured to their inventers by an enlightened
government.
Some estimate can be formed of the usefulness of the'present
patent, and its title to favor, when one machine is computed to perform the labor of planing and grooving in one day that would require fifty days by a man, and whhih is supposed to reduce near
seven tenths the expense of such work in every building where the
improved method is used, -as it ere long will be by the many
millions of our own population, and in time over the civilized
world. Every honest social system must shield such inventions,
and every wise one seeks undoubtedly to encourage them.
To be liberal, then, in the protection of patentees, is only to be
just towards the rights of property. To stimulate them in this and
other ways to greater exertions of ingenuity and talent is to increase the public wealth, and hasten the progress of practical improvements, as well as' of science. And to discountenance encroachments on their rights, and defeat piracies of their useful
labors, is calculated in .the end to better the condition of every
rank in society, and introduce wider and faster all the benefits of a
superior state of civilization and the arts.

The decision of the court in the preceding case of Wilson v. Rousseau et al.,
namely, that when a patent is renewed under the act of 1836, an assignee under
the old patent has a right to continue the use of the patented machine, but not
to vend others, again affirmed.
An assignment of an exclusive right to use a machine, and to vend the same to
others for use, within a specified territory, authorizes the assignee to vend elsewhere, out of the said territory, the product of said machine.
'The restriction upon the assignee is ony that he shall use the machine within the
specified territory. There is none as to the sele of the product.

Tirs case came up on a certificate of division in opinion between the Judges of the Circuit Court of the United States for
the District of Louisiana, sitting as a court of equity.
Wilson was the complainant below, who filed a bill, and obtained an injunction against Simpson, Forsyth, and Mills. After
sundry proceedings in the case, Forsyth put in a plea, and a rule
was obtained, that-the plaintiff should show cause why the injunction should not be dissolved. Upon argument, the court dismissed
the rule, and the case was set down for hearing by consent of parties ; the complainants not admitting the facts alleged in the plea,
but for the purpose of raising the questions of law which they-involved, and obtaining a speedy decision of the same.
