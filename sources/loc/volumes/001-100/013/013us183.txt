DEXTER,

ontra.

This Court has decided that this was a conditlon precedent, and that the tran-Xcr could not take place until
the condition was performed.
The first question is, whether, if the goods were accepted by Dnham and Rndollib, either in fact'or in
law, the property could pass in transitt. 'he general
principle is, that it could not. The ques'io, always is,
'in whom was the right of property (it the 'time of ship.
nent ? The simplicity and celerity with which thr trial
of captures m-iqt be conducted require that the question
should be limited to tlh. time of shipment. For the

same reason, prize Courts have rejected equitable liens.
If it were not so, further proof* would he required in
every case. 6 Rob. 329-note; T-wen Venner . ro~n .
This rule is reasonable. 'Possession is evidence of ownership. Change of title in transitu is only an exception
to the general rule. The exception should be confined
to the cases in which it has been held necessary, as
where possession could not be delivered, &c. The papers on board are always sufficient for the. captor&. In
a prize Court the documentary evidence is all important. This point is settled in the caqe of the claim of
Jones and MGee in the VetiUs at this term.
As to the further proof produced in this causei it is of
very little importance. Dunham and Randolph did not
comply with the condition upon which the properly was
to vest in them. They agreed to take a part only. and
therefore were not entitled to any. It is imm--terial
whether this bound Thenm to take the whole or not. It
did not bind Thompson. He had a right to refuse to
let them have any part, as they had not accepted the
whole, or he might insist upon their taking thp whole.
It was at his option to call upon them to account, as
his factors, for the whole. If Thompson had such a right,
the captors have such a right, for by the capture they
succeeded jure belli to all the rights of Thompson.
.The time was past when they accepted the goods b'y

the Fanny; th.'y 'were in the custody or the law under
the seizire of the revenue officers Dunhan and Rondolph could oily accept them coinditimially; i. e. if they
should le restored ; but if they should he condemned
they could not receive them.
It is not credible that they should have received them
absoltely at the time they were under seizur,.. Tivl) did
notbonafide accept them. It is not to be believed thatttliy
would take qpon themselves the risk of their cofidenination. It was probably done as a cover for the benefit
of Thompson. The goods not being according to order
they were not bound to accept them. Themlson made
a new proposil to them. They did not accept it, but
offered new terms on their part to whichThompsom did
not assent ; so that there was no agreement. The property never passed.

A&lN-

CLAIM,) Randolph accept the goods?

IoMPH's

BOYER,
MASTER.

2. The second is a question of law, pan such an ac.
ceptance chunge the title in transitu.
1. Dunham and Randolph, relying on the justice of
the United States, and -that they'would protect goods,
the property of citizens of the United States, shipped on
the faith of the declarations of their agents respecting
the effect of the repeal of the orders in council, did bona
fide accept them. This appears from their letter of the
19th of September. They had no motive to make the
goods appear American rather than British-for in
each case they would be equally liable to condomnation.
They relied entirely upon thejustice of the government.
The acceptance of the goods by the Fanny was abgolute. The language used in regard to those by the
Frances was intended to deceive the enemy, in case of
British capture.
Thompson had no right to annex the condition to
the acceptance. The goods were orde'ed by Dunham
.nd Randolph. Thompson htd a(reed to execute the
order, and was bound so to do. Inslhippin. tle goods
lie was executing an order, not makin. a bargain. Dun1m and Randolph had a right to take to their own account the goods ordere1, and receive the residue as a
consi-u-nnet to sell for the account of Thompson. If
the questionW're now open I should gay that these goods
never helonged to the shioper. They were purchasedby the agent of Dunham and Randolph by their order
and for their account.
2. In point of law, wiat wag tile effect of the acceptance? The acceptance was good for both cargoes or it
was good for neitbpr. Thotpson either lid or had not
a right to annex the condition. If he had not, then tke

Belligerent rights, in derogation of the common law,
are to be construed strictly. They are not to be extended further than the state of war requires. 5 Rob.
161, Yrow rnua Catharina. The rules of war are not
to.be changed for the convenience of captors. It is true
that the captors are to judge by the ship's papers ; but
.here the, ship's pape'rs all shewed the truth of the case;
and nothing but a single letter cast any doubt upon it,
The rulepxtends no further th.n that a neutral title
shag not orighiate during the voyage.
If the title originated anterior to the War; if the ship.
mient was made before the war, and not in c.,ntenjplation of war; and if the condition, upon which.the title
was to change, was annexed before the war; such a

contract could not be hi violation of the belligerent rights.
Thompson had not an option to hold Dunham and
Randolph to the acceptance or not as he pleased. it
they did an act which bound them, he was hound also.
The acceptance must be considered absolute, and the
condition not in derogation of belligerent rights.

This-claim is interposed to obtain restitution of three
bales and nineteen" boxes of goods captured in the Frances. As early as the 23d of July, 1811, these Claimants, anticipating a repeal of the orders in council,
give an order to Alexander Thompson of Glasgow, to
ship them a variety- of articles. In Jul$', 1812, upon
the repeal of the orders in council, rhnompson ships the
articles ordered; and, originally intending to ship to

the Claimants, a cohsignment on his own account, intermingles, with the pods ordered, a variety of others not

contained in the order of the Claimants.

These goods

aro shipped by tvo vessels, the Fanny and the Frances;
and, by a letter dated the lith of July, 18112, Thompson

advises the Claimants of these shipments ; and, after descanting on the merits of tre articles, and declaring his
reason for blenling othertgoods with those shipped to
theirorder, and his Aibsequent determination to make
them an offer of the. adlditonal gonds, he continues in
these words: 6,I leave it with yourselves to take the
" whole of the two shipmnts, or none at all, just as you
please. If you do not wish them, I .will thank you to
"hand theinvoices and letters over to Messrs. Falconer,
, Jackson and Co. I think tweniy-four hours will al6, low you ample opportunity for you to make up your
"minds on this point; and if you do not hand them over
, within that cime, I will, of course, consider that yot;
" take the wholc."
, You will s.e.I think the reason" ableness 'of ypur taking the whole, or none of the
',
shipment."
The Fanny reached the waters of the United States in
safety; and, being seized by a reveru., critter, was'carriedinto New London, where she has been inally restored. ''he Frances was captured on the 28th of August,
by the privateer -Yankee, ahd carried into Rhode loand.
On the !2d of August, after the arrival of the Fanny, the
CL.imants write to Falconer, Jackson & Co. and accept
of the shipment by the Fanny; but with regard'to that
by the Frances, they write in the following words : " His
66letter also speaks of another shipment of thirty-one
" packages per Frances which on arrival we shall then
- hand in our determinatiomi." On the first of Septembe followi.g, they again write to Falconer, Jackson &
Co. intimating their acceptance of the shipment by the
Frances.
On this Ptate of facts it is contended that the Claimants
are entitled to restitution-that they either had an original. interest in the gpbds shipped or had acquired one
before the capture.
In the ordinary course of mercantile transactions, a
delivery to a ship-master is'a delivery to the cogsignee.

upon his agency in strict cinformity with the. instruc- & RANtions of his principal, or with such reservations or con- DolP's
ditions as he may think proper to prescribe; and the CLAIM,)
only consequenc* is, that, in the latter case, he leaves BOYEif,
his principal at liberty to adopt or repudiate his acts. M!ASTER.
Tiv shipper who purchases g iods on his own credit or
with his own funds, is not acting in the ordinary capacity (ifa 'actor. If he were, the goods, Pvwn before shipment, would be the property of the individual on whose
oider the purchase is made. Such shipmients are in the
nature of a' mercantile credit., and the shipper always
retains the uncontroded exercise of discretion in extending it. There was, therefore, nothing inconsistent with
the relative rights of the parties, in Thompson's imposing upon the consignees the condition of taking all or
none of the two shipments; and the consequence was,
that the delivery was -not absolute, but quahfied; and,
until the condition performed, the goods remained the
propeity of the shipper; and had they suffered slipwreck; the loss would have been his.
But it is contended that the condition was performed,
and that this case forms an exception from the rulq that,
as to the exercise of belligerent rights, there shall be no
transfer in transmiu.
The acceptance of the cargo by the Fanny was on
the 2d, the capture of the Frances on the 28th of August. It is contended that the acceptance of the Fanny's cargo was conclusive as to both shipments; and
that, although partial in terms, it must, in law, have
effect as to the whole, since such was the condition imposed by the shippfr; and that it was, in fact, the intention of the Claimants that such should be the effect
of the acceptance; but the reservation was intehded
only as a -.use do guerre to guard against, the efrects of
hostile capture.'
There is certainly nothing illegal in resorfing to devices to elude hostilq capture; and where it ca4 be

import, and such eilTct given to. it as Its worls imply.
This letter 'contains ap express exclusion of tir goods
under conside'ration ; but- it is contended" that,, as
Thompson's letter left thiem no latitude, but oPliged them
'either to choosdÂ°dr rfuse the whole, their acceptance
of hark cast on them the property in the whole.
But we are of opinion that such was not the effect of
this art of the Claimants. *The consequence of such a
vioctrine would be that where a prolperty is to be acquired 1upon a 6ondition performed, the condition 'may
bercjected, arid yet the property acquired. It certainly
pul.t
it 'in the power of the blippers either to cast the
whol" property upon the Claidmants, or resume the pro.tcrty; and make the consignee accountable for that
whicli had come to his hands. Falconer, Jackson &
Co. upon the arrivai of the Frances, had she not been
captured would hve had an undoubted right to demandlte shipment made by her, on the ground of the
Claimats' not having accepted it within the time linjited apd ifwould have been in vain for the Climants
to hae cointestcd their' rig ht,, whilst they held the letter

Thoibion' or i.agent to k'etain the piojperty in this
shipment, & cast it upon the Claimants, the consequen6e
is,
that the. legal interest, still remained in the shil)pers.
