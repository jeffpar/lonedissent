&OTHERs.

The nature of the estate intended to be conveyed, is
expressed in the word cglebe" well known in the Engliqh law, as a provision for the par'son of a parish.
The law says that the freehold only vests in the reg-1Iar
parson ; not'the fee: coqseqiiently the grant or disposition of land, in such case, for a globe, does not mako or
imply a disposition of the fee; the fee, therefore, remains in the grantor.
The words " for a glebe for the church of EDgidnd as
by la76 established," expiress clearly the intention of the
grant, viz: tor the SUpport and extonsion of the national church, considertd in its political connexion. It is
not a grant to the national church as a body. No such
grant over was made, or if made, would be valid. Every prevision for its support is to some organ of the
church. as to the bishop of such A see, or the phrson of
such a.parish. and his successors. A parish church, in
the English law, is the building consecrated and endowed. There must be a glebe, which may be the church
yard only. Th'e parson has, in the glebe, no more than
a freehold estate. He'is considered in'law as a solo corporation, and the freehold passes by succession. Parighes are a civil and ecclesiastical division; the inhabitants of a parish, the parishioners, the members of the
.national chuich) are never said to be members of the
pa~ish church; neither the parishioners nor the vestry
have any right in.. or power -over the glebe, not even
during a vacancy, (See I Black. page 117.) The
chtrch of England-never was established by law, either
in Now Hampshire or Vermont, before orsince. the revolution. Neit!ter the civil nor ecclesiastical law, as
applicable to globes, was, known or recognized at the
date of the charter; nor as it been adopted or rec ognized since in either of those states.
he intention of
the erant, ther -fore, even before the revolation, dodd
never have been carried int. ef,'ct. Itis also well
knoVn that, at the date of the charter, the land therein
granted was a wilderness, and so continued for a long
time afterwards.

At the time of the grant, tlier,'fo'e, there was not only
no church, of England established by law, but in the
town of Pawlet there was no organ of that or any other

can take effect agreeably to th intenlion of the donor.
By the revolution we have bec'ome cowpletel. s.ered
from the church or England as by law cstablish;i d. Individuals and scieties may p isse~s the same land. have
the came mode of worship, and tie same ordinances adniuistered in the same mann.r, and suhnit to the smne
discipline, as far as may be eflficted with,,ut the assistance of the civil arm. But thi.- constitutes, in the view
we are now taking of the. sabject, similffari,. not idenity.
It fornishes9 no ground for legal dcrivttion ul' (ivil or
legal connexion. In every political, civil and l.gal
view, and in a!l tie civil and legal consequences, the
dissolution or the church of England, as by law establistied, was in the United S'ates as total and coiap!ete
on the rev.kition, as that of the civil power of the British goverument. Nor has there ever been in lhe state.
of VerniQnt, a subsUtute adopted. Evry idea of a
national or qtate religion has been exploded. The Cu.t
will consider how many things are requisite to the legal
possession and enjoyment of a glebe; how much of the
common law of England, and how mu'h of the cannon
law must be adopted or considerewas in force; although,
in every civil and politial view, the inilitution or establishment to which they applied is abolished. There
must be. a parish. a church with cure, a parson, legally
and canonically introduced-four things are requisite to
constitte, a parson; I. 1oly orders: 2. Preintaim or
Collatio ; 3. Institution; 4. Induction; lie mrist be a
sole corporation. No part of the common lam, on this
sul'ject has been adopted in the state of Vermont; either by the comstitution, by statute, or by legad adjudications.
It would be absurd to consider any number of Epis.

copalians, formed into a society inVermont, as staidingia
the place of a parish, and capable. contrary to the doc.
trine of thecoimmn law under which they must lerrive,
of succeeding to tiLe freehold or a glebe, or of taking mid

holding by succession or otherwise, by or under a grant

towN oF of lands for a glebe, made by tie king of. Great Britain
PAVLET before the revolution. There is a statute in Vermont,
o.
(see an act for the support of the gospel, passed in 1707p,
1. CLARK Revised Laws, Vol. 2, page +74) under which religious
OTH.RS. societies may be formed ; but it does not appear, in the
case, that tile society in the ,toWn of Pawlet is formed
under that act. But, if so formed. the members of such
society arc'not confined to anty particalar limits, and if
associated from 4, or 5 different towns, they may have a
claim eqtually good to the gh'be lands, in each t6wn.
This statute, which extends equally to all denominations of Chri.tiauis, constitites societic or associations
forineil under it, corporatibons or quasi corporations;
and enacts, ",That they shall have power to hold to
"6thenmselves and successors, all surh estates and into",rests, as they may hereafter acquire. by pur-hase or
"otherwise, and the same to s'l and transfer, for the
"benefit of. such association,"
A society so formed,
has th: pecise power given by "the.act and no other.
The, power is limited to future acquisitions; the power
to sell is .co-extensive %vith Ih- pnwer of acquisition.
Noting is to be holden which shall be perpetually, appropriated, as a glebe is. Such society is not empow.
cied to succeed to estates, riglts or interests, granted
prievious to their existence, although limited to objects
similar to its own.- Indeed tle expression in the act
seems to have intended an exclusion of such claim.
If the share in question si-ould be considered as a reservtion foi- a f-tue paricuhir use, it then reinained'itt
the kig, the donor. until a state of things should arise,
whun it could be appli-d to such us'. 1hlis use Is -'pecified in the cha-t-r, viz: for a glebe, &c. We have
before proved that, priuo' to the revolution, it had not
been. and could not. cnnsist'ntly with the institutions of
the country b" s, applit d. It, of course, remained in
the king at fhe rvvolu:ion, and at that time vested in the
state of Vermont.
At tle-date of this charter a separation of the provinces or colonies from the mother country vwas not
contemplated. It was indloubtvidly intonded at that times
by the donor. that the church of England should be ",stablished by law in the province of New Hampshire, ag

it had been in some of the other provinces, and particu-

TEZ

larly in Virginia. "Inthis charter, therefore, 'as well as TOWN OF
in all other charters, granted by the governor of New PAWLET
Hampshire, provision was made, fly a reservation of a
V.
certain share of every township, for such an establish- n. cLMM
m.ent.
&OT1Itns.
If the share in question be considered, in the nature
of a grant, then, as we have before stated, the grant of
"6a gkvbe," if it took effect at all, is of the freehold only,
and not of the fee; of the freehold to be taken and held
by the incumbents in succession.
The fee, of course, not being granted, remained in
the grantor. By the English law, as well as our own,
on the dissolution or political death of a corporation, all
estates granted to such corporation revert to the grantor
or donor. And if a grant was made by the king to any
person, or number of persons, incapable of taking or
holding, or if the object ceased to exist, or never came
into existence, the estate was considered as never having
passed, or as reverting to the king, according to the
nature of the case.
On the revolution tie state of Vermont, as a sovereign state, succeeded, in full and sovereign riglt, to
all the property and rights.f property within the same,
which, at the time, were vested in or appertained to the
king .of Great *Britain, whether in possession or reversion. The cask-, then, stands thus; a tract of land in
the town of Pawlet was, by the king of Great Britain,
before the revolution granted ",for a glebe for the
6c church of England, a-.by law established ;" that is,
thefreehold to -vest to a particularuse, when thit use .,hould
arise, the remainder or reversion in the crown. There
is no securing, in the constitution of Vermont, to any
man or body of nn, of any rights or benefits, which
under th e crown were intended for the church of England as by law established. At the time of the revolttion there had Aever bedh, within the territory, now
state, of Vermont, a regudarparson, who could make any
possible legal claim or pretence to the use of any of the
glebe lands within the same. The sole corporation, as
the parson was denominated, was not disiulved or exfinguished by a political death, because in Vermont it

contra.

It is contended by th counsel for the Plaintiff that

nothing passed by the grant contained in the charter or
Pawlet; go as to divest the king of Great Britain of the
title to the premises in question. IfIthi position is correet, it must be admitted that the Plaintiff is entitled to
recover; because it cannot be denied that the title of
the crown to any. lands anti-cedent to the revolution,
within the jurisdiction of the now state of Vermont,
would of course become the property of the state. If,
however, the ground taken by the Faintilff's coun-As,
shall be found untenable, and that fir title of the king
was div. ited by the grant; then, whether the Defendants have a title or not, wvill he a matter of indifference; so long as the Plaintiff,; must recover on the
strength of their own title, and not on the weakness of
ours.
If, by the grant, the fitle passed from th,. then king,
the state or Vermont could acquire no right by the revolution ; but the title must remain, unless forfeited, as
at the time of the grant.
The reason given by the counsel for tAe .Plainfiff to
show that, notwithstanding the -charter,' tl:e title renained ;n the grantor is. that when made, there w'as no
.grante in esse capable of taking the foe, or other estate,
so as to divest the king of his. If this be true, 6n a
fair construction of the letters pat,-ot, it must also be admitted that the Plaintiff is entitled to judgment.
it is believed that, on examination of the'charter, the
Count will be of opinion that there was a sufficient
grantee in esse; and that the title did pass by that instrurheiit And if there was then, no matter wljat h'ls

" entered on this grant, to be divided to and animonPt them,
- into sixty-eight equal shares, all that tract, or parcel of
"land. 4-." describing and bounding the Whole township of Pawlet.
It is contended hers that the whole of the land, contained within th;3,boundary lines of the township, was
.designed to be granted without any saving or regervation to the crown, of any part of the same. The
whole of the six miles square was granted; to whom?
To the loving subjects, of his majesty in New Hampshire and elsewhere. How was it granted? In fee simple; and in sixty-eight equal shares, to be equally divided to, and amongst the king's loving subjects named
on the grant.
He granted to them (he they more or less in number)
the whole township of Pawlet as tenants in common,
and not in severalty. Hence, each man named on the
grant became entitled to his proportionable jart of the
whole township, whether he was one of sixty-eight, or
one of three.
It is presumed the Court in this case will be much inclined to do, as Courts have generally done, if possible
by their construction to satisfy the object of the grant,
an.d give it a meaning which was intended by the graator. It is a-rule of construction to search out the intention, and make-that a land mark.
Possessing liberal views of this instrument,, it will no
doubt he found that the grantor designed to pass*the
title to the whole town of Pawlet; to his loving subjects named thereon, and not to confine the grant to a
.sixty-eighth part of the township to each, but ii proportion to-thewhole number, more or less.
tXow, supposing that a part of the naies. written on

others, who answer the description given, i Loing
subjects Of the grantor."

Fictitious persons could not be loving subjects; therefore the whole, land would pass to the real persons.
Most, iinquestionably the whole tract was granted to
those capable of taking a title.
It will be seen by the grant, that the lands werd not
allotted, of course no partition was made amongst tho
patentees until after the charter was made. The grant
was in common and not'in severlidty ; therefore nd inference of an intention to give each proprietor bilt a single share an be drawn from, the circumstance of the
whole town being required to be divided into sixty-eight
equal shares. As well might the bounsel contend that
it was inferrable from a law incorporating a bank with
three thousand shares that the stockholders could havb
but one share each.
If the foregoing is a correct construction of the instrument before the Court, then it results as a certain
inference that the crown had not a rood of land remaining in Pawlet; and, consequently, the state of Vermont
could have none; as' the state pretends to po greater
right or title than that of the king.
2. It will be attempted to be slown that on the 26th
day of August, 1761, there was in ase a church of England, as by law established, which could be a granteo
of the crown., If so, the title passed directly to the
church in foe simple; and would need no auxiliary to
sustain her right.
It is said by the counsel that lands granted for the
benefit-of the church, arbgranted to the bishop, or some
other ecclesiastical person ; but it would be strange doctrine to say that the king had not power to grant di.
rectly to the church established hv law; and therefore
distinctly identified as a Christian society. The position will here le ventured, that such a grant to the
chudch of England as by law "established wasp and still
i's valid.

FEBRUARY TERM 8i.
To maintain the point that the church existed at the THE
date of the grant, we need only appeal to historical facts TOWN oF
in tie English books, and the still mkee authentic testi- pAWLET
mony of the body, of the English law, the statutes and
V.
adjudgea cases of the realm, within the recollection, and n. CL&.M

familiar to the mind of the Court
It is said "; that when the grant was made there was
no church in Pawlet' it was all new. There was no
established church in New Hampshire or New York."
Whether true or not, as it respects this part of the argument, is not worth enquiry; for it will be remembered that the words of the'grant do not confine the bounty
of the sove-reign to Pawlet, New Hampshire, or the
American continent: it is co-extensive with his do.minions, and-may he -claimed by. the church wherever
found xvithik them.
That there was a church established by law in Great
Britain no-one will deny: if so, what shoulad prevent
that church from being the grantee ? IIf can hardly b
denied that the king could grant lands lying in one of
liis American colonies to his subjects beyond the Atlantic, as effeztually as those who resided in that colony.
It was all within his territorial jurisdiction ; and place
of residence could have no 'influence. It may be said
that the grant, is to the king's sulbjects in, New Hamp,shire. True; bit the words ",and our other governme t" are added. .These words. may embrace the
whole governments pnd dominions of his majesty.
If, however. this ground should fail us- there can be
no difficulty, it is presumed, to ascertain the existence
of a church in the colonies capable of taking a title to
the propetty in question.
In ,Virginia, if information is correct, the Episcopalian church wag established by milaw of that colony before the date of the grant; but whether so o not, we
feel indifferent because by a future construction of the
grant, we have the utmost confidence that the true
meaning is not a church established by any law in the
American colonies, but that the,words - as by law estabMsed, are used as-descriptive of the denomination of
,phristians, initended as the sabjects of royal munificence.

That this is a natural construction is manifest from
the fact that the government cotld not have been ignorant of the state of the church in the colonies, and it
would bb the height of absurdity to suppose a grant to
be made to a body of Christians, which the grantor well
knew did not exist. The Court surely will never impute to the officers of any government such triflling and
mockery. If, therefore, the colonial Episcopal church
was intended as the subject of this bounty, and if she
was not established by law, it must follow, as an irresistable inference that the woirds ";as by law established," are words of description and not of identity.
Having established this point, we will show by historical proof a church in. the state of New Hlampshire,
long antecedent to the date of thiegeant.
In 'Belknap's hist. of Xcw Hampshire, 2 vol. 118, it is
stated that iu the year 1732, a building for. an. Episcopal church was erected at Portsmouth, in New Rampshire. In 1734f the church was consecrated; and in
1736 they obtained a clergyman of that order by the
name of Arthur Browne.
If this church was capable of taking a title to land,
as I shall hereafter show, all the difficulty suggested on
the part of the Paintiff will be removed.
Some reasons will now be giveui to show that surh a
clnrch as was-established in New Hampshire was capable of taking a title to, real property.
I. The king, by the act' of gi;anting, creates sufficient
corporate powers, to carry into Wefect his designs. That,

FEBRUARY TERTM 18i.
T"l,
he can create corporations cannot be doubted. He did,
by the very instrumf nt before the Court, create in the TOWN o
town of Pawlet all the corporate powe.rs and &er.ga- PAIT T

tivws which they now possess; a body sufllciu, tly
known in law to be invested with the suppo.-ed legal 1),M:,Afl
estate in the premises in question; and by an act of the &OTU-USS
.
very fegislature who have authorized them to bring tis .
action. Ifthe king had the auhoriry to incorp-orate, it
can.be easily an:., legally inferr. d fr-in the grant that
this body was sufficiently incorporated thereby.

Should congress, by law, give to the Presbyterian
thurch of the city of Washington a portion of the public
lands, would the Court e-ndure to be.t.ld that thert- , was
no proof of the incorporation of the chur i,ergo the
law was void-'he title ne er passed either by tle lae

or grant made in pursuance thereof?
In a case thus situated, the Court may, indeed they
ought to infer, for it is a jus. leJgal deduction, and bot-

tomed upon the sindest juaguient of Iw, that a sove-

reign, granting power, (always supposed, prima facie
at least, to he right) had not indulged in the folish
blunders, of granting'real property fonr ost desirable
ends, to shadows and non entities. And it isconfidently
believed that the Court will determine as a reasmnahle
and legal intendment, that the church of.Xew ffampshir.
was made capable of holding this property.
There is a further reason to suppose the church capable of taking a title. The grant being a governmental
,act, and of such high and incontrovertible authority,
every statement and fact contained in it is so far proved
that it cannot be denied. If this be correct, the grant
itself proves the whole that need be proved to maka
this part of the grant valid, and to vest tile title in the
church. The Court, therefore, will not receiv any
statements, iistory, conjectures, or Vermont preanibles,
to contradict the acts of the British government nade
in solemn and official form. It is true that a prior
grant from the same authority may be shown to defeat
a subsequent. But that is permitted for very different
reasonf; because the first act of a government, granting
awayits lahds, vests a title in the grantee, nid thore iN
not ih. left to give.

In'support of this position it is submitted, 'whether
Tow" oF the words "6one share as a glebefor the church (f England,
AW.lIJ.T tc." are not tantamount to a positive averment of an
IV. existing church in this country which could be the legal
). CLARK. subject of, donation by letters patent. There is this
&.,rrunirs. strong reason to support such an opinion, that we never
can impute ignorance or error to a sovereign while exi
ercising the high prc.'ogatives of his station. We never
can saty that he, as the organ of the government, has
been granting land without a grantee; that be has mis.
taken the facts or the law, andt consequently nullify his
acts. It is enrugh that the instrument points to the
_grantee and gives the object; it6 legal attributes are to
be presumed.

The Plaintiff comes, claiming under th6 very title
granted to us; in which grant we are acknowledged to
have a prior right Had this grant been from other
than the government on whom thQ doctrine of estppel
cannot fasten, it would be enough for us to hold up the
charter between the claim and our possession and shut
the Plaintiff at once from even a view of the Court.
Even now, whether the doctrine of estoppel will apply
or not,tne thing is true-that what the king, under
whmnntA6 Plaintiff claims, has solemnly recognized as
correct must be binding upon the governmetit of Vermont, andA consequently, upon the Plaintiff by this
cause.
The act of the 'British government is not the.only
governmental act which the church has to secure their
possession.
The l'e,islature of Vermont on the 26th day of Octo-

ber, t787, passed an act .,to authorize the selectmen in
the sererat towns of the stale to imnprove the glebe tands,
."
And, after enacting that the selectmen sholdl
'.have power to Ipase out the glebe lands, receive the rctSt,
bring ations of ejectment, recover the possession thereof, when posvessed by persons without'right, they mnake
a proViso in the words following: "cProvided neverthed,less, that nothin,-contained in this act shall extend so

By this proviso it is perfectly obvious that the legis- &orinus.
lature intended to manifest a legal recognition or the
ri.ht of the church to the prop,.rty.
It is also equally obvious that by the act authorizing
the se.lectmen to talce care of the glebe lots, and obtain
possession by action of ejtetment of those which were
possessed by squatters, tlhe. leg~slature dh signed not to
filch away the land from the church, and in the plenitbde of their power to forget right, but to secure the title and p,omote the interests of the church. If not, why
in the proviso are the Episcopal clergy preferred to other
cler gy in the management oif the lands; and why are
they preferred even to the selectmen as the guardians of
the property. The proviso i§ high and indisputable
proof that the object of the statute was solely to preserve
the property from waste for the benefit of the church,
to preserve for it th income which might result from
its prudent imanagement, and to save the title from loss
by long adverse possession.
After all this, one would suppose that the state Would
never indulge itself in attempting to divest the church
of their property; yet, strange. as it may appear, on the
30th of October. 1791, the, legislature of Vermont make
another act concerning the glebe lots, and the following
is its-preamble :
,Whereas, by the first principles of our government
0C it is cont mplated that all religious s. cts and denomi"nations of Christians, whqse religious tenets are con"sistent with illegiance t the constitution and .govern"ment (if
this slate, should. receive equal protectiop and

- the uses (if the. said rights shiould be to the sole and

,nact that the rents and profits of all the glebe lots
shall be appropriated to the support of religious worS-alp in their ;:espec;tive towns forever; without' regard

to the sect of Christians, and all should share alike, accobrding to the n.imber of taxable inhabitants, in the parishes respectively.
In this preamble they seem to admit that the title to
the glebe lots was vested in the church. They do not
deny sd1 a construction of the grant, nor do they urge,
s a reason for taking away the propi'rty from the Episcopalians, that tho grant was void, or that, the title was
in the drown before the. rev.lutiop; and that thereby
they became intitled to the property ; but they say these*
lots were granted or exclusively to build up a national
religion of a government diverse from and inconsistent
with the rights of their governmeat;" and for these
reasons they attempt to divwst the, church of their title
in ord(l to give the property, or the income of it, to
other sects of Christians.
Thp reason given for enacting thiaJaw is strong evi,
dence :f the opinifon f'the legislature, that the title had
passed out of the crown and vested in the church. But
as they- disliked an established religion, supposed it
anti-republican, and what was more to be dreaded, it
Was established in a government "sdiverse f'oi the government of Vermont," and inconsistent with their
rights, or rather their-religious and political opinions ;being disageable in these particulars they tAke away
the income of the land from the Epispopalians to appropriate it to other and, no doubt as they supposed, bletter
purposes.
Notwithgtandihg the length and force of this pream.
ble, and the cogent reasouns given'for making the law,
on the fifth day of Nov,,mher, 4799, the legislature repeal this act; and in so doing most manifestly abandbn
all pretentions to the churchipropi'rty; for in the ro.
pealing law they take care to secure those, who have
trrspa'sed upon those lands, from actions which might
be brought for so trespassing :-admitting in the fullest
sense that men who had intermeddled with the propert,

FEBRUARY TERM 186.
by the authority and in pursuance of theii law had so
TnE
trespassed. Hence the Court will see that the legisla- wow, or
ture, both in the making and in the repealing of the. law of PANYLET
79-, show that the act was an unjust attempt at usurV.
pation.
D. cAnK
&OTHERS.

By the record of the case of Pettiboie -. Barber, tried
before the late justice Patters!n at a Vermont circuit, it
ap,ears that the Plaintiff' failed in an action brouglit in
pursuance. of this law. It is said that the juige pronounced the law unconstitutional and void. Thfs decision might have induced the repeal, as the trial was had
in the intermediate time between the passage and repeal of the act.
The legislature in the year 1805 passed another acts
and by that discover less solicitude for the Christian
church in any form. This, to,, has a preamble, contradictipg in its terms the ol, in which, they .say,
co Whereas, the several glebe rights, granted by the
"British government to the church of England as by
"law esta~lished," are in ,, the nature of public reser",vations," they, therefore, give them to the selectmen
of the towns where they lie respectively, for the use of
schools, &c.
The first act contains by implication a decided confirmation of the title in the church. The second, although
contradictory 'in its provisions and repugnant to that
right, exhibits in a strikinglightin its preamble and in the
repealing clause, a thorough convittion, in the mind.of
the legislature, of the fallacy of their pretentionsi urging facts which, if true, would contribute nothing in
support of those pretensions. In the last they urge a
new reasonj for their law, and, as we suppose, equally unsound. Here they become wiser, and not only act
the legislators but 'judge's, scout ahat had been done
by their prvdecessors, and give -a construction of
the grant which is indeed a strange one, but which, if
correct, is supposed, as will be hereafter shewn, to defeat the right to recover in this case.

.To maintain this point the Court are reforred to 2

Blue. Com. OG, 1o. Lit. 342, where it-is laid down, that
an estate may be granted to John for life, and t'.'vn to
the heirs of Richard, although Richard has no heirs at
the time of the grant.
Here, although the life estate vests in John immediately, yet the fee must be in abeyance, until the heirs of
Richard are in esse. Indeed the happening of tho Vvent
is perfectly contingent, for those in remainder uay
never exist. - Should it be said that the fee remains in
the grantor during the life estate, ready to vest in the
heirg of Richard if t'iey exist at the determination or the
li;fe estate, or to continue. in him by reverter if Richard
has no heirs; it is met by urging thac if this doctrine
be correct; then with equal propriety may it be contended on our part, that the fee remained in the king ready
to vest, whenever there should be a church.
Rut says the state of Vermont, t,we have a' right by
forfeitue to the king's property." True, but no greater right than the king had ; which was a naked legal
title ; the use belonged elsewhere. Of this hereafter.
In the 2 Black. Corn..311, it is said that ecclesiastical
estates must sometimes necesgarily be in abcjance, and
that wliere there is no person in whom the fee can vwst,
it.potentially exists in abeyance; as between the death
of the incumbent and the next puesentation.
The parson having but a lifo estare in the glebe, unless it could so exist on his death, it must revert to the
grantor.
Christian, in hzs notes on Blackstone, supposes the fee
to be all the while in the lord of the manor.
This is by. no means the opinion of Blackstone, or of
the still greater lawier, Cove; both of whom, if they are
correctly understood, lay down the law to be, that the fee
exists, between the death of the parson, and his succogsor, not in the lord, but in abeyance.

4. If the construction of the patent contended for in TIM.
the inception of this argument is correct, 4here will he TOWN-OF
no difficulty in fibding agraidee.'to uphold the fee, and PAWJ6.T
make it subservient t.o the benevolent intentions of the
T.
crown. It would not be aviolent or unnaiural construc- n. .i.Auir
tion to say that the town of Pawlet was granted to the &oTIrnnS.
persons named on the grant, in fee, up.on condition that
they should, in tic locatit.n of the t'wn, lay out and set
apart i one share as a glebe for the church of E glad,
Jkc." together wvith the other shares, for Bcnnin.g Wentworth, the first sf-led minister, and the school, according to te directiois indorsed.
Under such a construction, whkther the church were
incorporated or not, they might reap the benefit of' toe
use; .for as soon as tly become organized, and a
clergyman settlel, they wotld be capable of receiviug the
income of the land.
This constru.tion was adopted by te proprietors of the
town. In locating the same they did survey a share and
mark it off-as a glbe right. This appears friom the several acts of the state and in the argument of the counsel
for the Plaintiff.
The preseutinhabitants of the toWn must all hold. their
lands under the grant befp'e us, and not only so but
from the origina lroprietors who so located and consecrated tho-giebe right which is now claimed by those
persons.
By the laws, of England, and prohably of all cqlized
countries,- the claimor or posssior of land is bound by
the acts and confessions of thoso unde6 whomi he holds
the claim or possession. By this rule then the.presefit
inhabitants of Pawlet are hound by the act of lheir predecessors. That act was a complete recognition of the
right of the church to the property ; an act which spuke
louder than any language.
It may be said that the share was located by the proprietors of the town in their corporate capacity. If that
was the case it is still the worse for them, because a corporation bever dies, and the location was.the act of the
Plaintiff upon the record in this cause; and they are now

Again, it appears, that the Plaintiff in this cause is
M.cinx now enjoyingthe benefits of this construction in the shur
&oTHERs. given to a school and th, first minister settled in the
town. Without t:i-4, or the third position taken in this
argument, the town would have but slender prtences to
the use of those two shares ; but it seems they claim those
two lots by the same, or a more uncertain title, hold them
by the same tenure, derive the right from the same
source, and yet claim tho glebe also, and in order to sup.
port that claiin are driv-n to the necessity of denying the
legal and efficient prop.,rties of the instrument by which
they, as well as the church claim.
B. This is a trust estate. The patentees named upon
the gxant are the trustees for the use of the church whenever it should be organized in the town of Pawlet, so as
to be enabled to receive the rents of the land.
'If a use can result from a grhnt by implication, it is
supposed this is a case of that kind.
In expectation that objections will be made to-such an
interpretation of the casle those objections are endeavour'ed to be answered.
1. It may be said that the grant is silent as to any use
or trust and therefore it is not to be implied.
The answer is, wherev6r from the nature or'the grant,
a trust estate can be implied, with propriety, where it is
necessary to carry into effect the object of letters patent,
the Court will adopt the implication.'

It has already been shewn that a church was in esse,..
when the grant was made and whether the church was
or was not incorporated, ca:un it be material; in either
case the title in the trustee would be valid. To this
point the Court are d.sired to lo ,kat i1Rep. 23, 21,and
2b, and Gilb. ws cases, 44f, where it will be found that
public institutions are capable of enjoying a trust, and
it was decided that the pnor of the parish of Dale, although not incorporated, were capable of a trust. With.
out adopting the principle thiat the church can lake an
equitable interest in these premises, there would in many
cases be an end to the workings of betievolence. Science
might often lose her patrons; the needy their benefactors, -and religion her warmest supporters.
Before wb part with this point we will once more look
a the act of 1805, upon which the Plaintiff founds JA5
hich de,-lares tile
right to recover; and to its preamble, %%
glebe lands in tile nature. of public reservations. If this
nw.ans any thing, it uiust mean that the legal estate was
reserved to the crown. As a proof that the legislature
and as such
so meant, observe tha followitg language, d,
dc by thd revolution became vested in the sovereignty of lids
"state." Now, sovereign as the state may be. she can
have no other or greater title than the crowr bf Great
Britain had after the grant and before the revolution,
and that right could be no more than a right reserved
for tire use of the church; heca .s'it never 'ought to be
supposed that the crOwn made t"is -rant with no other
what it before had. If
design than to reserve to its -lt,
the king had an inclination to retain for his own use.a
few shares -of the land, he might have done it dirertly ;
in the same manner as the pine trees were reserved for
his royal navy.
'Phis then is the rightof the stateof Vermont, on their

If thbrefore the const'uction of thp legislature of Veimont shotild be adopted, it would oily help the Plaintift
to be defeated in this action; for it cannot be believed
that the use as well as the legal estate could be reserved
by the grant before the Court.
WLIBSTER, in ftply.
1. It is said to be the obvious intention of thb grantor
to pass, by the grant, all the territory of Pawlet, without any saving or reservation. But this i's
against the
express words of the grant. The grant is made, " upon the conditiotis and reservations hereafter made;"
nor is there any thing in the grant, to which the term
- reservation" can be properly applied, except it be th
public rights, as they are usually called, of which the
nait appropriated for a. glebe, &c. is one.
The Defendants counsel further supposes, that at*though the territory was to be divided into sixty-eight
equal parts, yet this was not to designate the propertini which each grantee was to receive; but that if any
person, named in the grant, should not accept, or not
be capable df taking, or not happen to be. a person in,
esse, or in othee such case, then the whole tract would be
to be divided among the residue. This is believed not
to be a sound construction of the words of the grant.

Those words are, " do give and grant in equal shakres
,41unto our lovingsuhjects, &c. whoso names are entered

,"on this grant, to be divided amongst them into sixty" eight equal shiars, all that tract,'- &c. To what purpose was the tract to be divided into sixty-eight equal
shares, if it were not to ascertain what portion 'each
grantee should have?

A great part of the states of New Hampshire and
Vermont were granted by charters, issucd in tht. name
of the crown, by the provincial governors of New Hampshire, which, charters were in all respects like this.
These charters or grtants have reccived a sttlcd construction, which has been followed by long usage, in
both states. No case is known to have existed, in
which any grantee has claimed a greater portion of the
whole land, than his name bore to the nams on the
charter, including the public right; nor has any severance or partition been made, in any case, uptin any
other ride or principle. To divide the land into sixtyeight equal parts, anti then adopt the plan of appropriating the whole t)a less number of owners, as, in the,
example supposed by the Defendants counsel, to three,
giving each twenty sixty-eighth parts, and two
thirds of one sixty-eighth part moro. would be to act without object or motive. Such therefore has never been
supposed to have been the course contemplated in the
grant. The .division or partition of lands holden tinder
these charters has been, as is believed, in every instance,
by dividing the whole into as many parts, commonly
called rights, as there were individuals named on the
charter, together with the public rights, anti allowing

lative provision is recollected to have been made. The
first settled minist, r has usually posqessed the right designated for him. The town corporatiins, bodies totally distinct from the original prnpri,.tors, and owing
their corporate existence, in all cases, to their charters,
or to acts of the legislature (for although this charter

PA.WLBT have had the mangement and dispositia'n of the school

D. CLARK towns, in their corporate 'character, to wake proision
&OTHERS. for the support of free ichou1s, within the town, 9Alt
under the manIgzment, -or t.e town a thority. Thesc
school rig lts having been ofiginally intl.nded to aid in
the support of schools,.it has been holden, that, the
law, throwing the duty of this support osn the town, hana
given them the disp:sition of this fund for that.purposo.
There bpiig no manner of privity between the town corporations end-the original grantees of the soil, the former can derive no title to these, school rights, but from
the law ,of the state. That they have right to them
js been settled by mapy de.cisions, followed by uniforni
practice.

The grant to the society for propogating the gospet
presented a different case. That was a corporation,
then existing, and still r-xisting in England, capable by
its ch'rter, of -olding lands ; and dpubtless entitled,
originally, to take the portion intended for it in this grant.
Wflethr this society was not so far connected with the
national church and the realm of England, as that its
ri. lts were. divested by tlhe revolution, has never been
decided. Actions are pending, both in the Circuit and
State Courts, n which this society is party, in relation
to the's.. ands.
The glchp right has generolly, in point of fact, been
occupied M. disposed of by the town. No individu.
al has been able to maintain a right to one of these lots,
or portitns,, upon his ecclesiastical character. It has
been holden, on the contrary, that the grant, so far as
it undertook to give one sixty-eighth part for a gleilbe,
was void, for want of a grantee. Tho Plaintiff's cotinsel

2. The Defendant contends that there was a church n CL&UM
of England, as b) law established, capable of taing. &OTuERs.
On this point, the Plaintiff's counsel will only remark,
1. That no grant to the church of Englapd, co tiwminw,
coald'avail, even in England, to pasi the fee. Would
su ch a grant entire to the see of Canterbury, or the diocese of London? The church of.England, in the aggregate, is not a curpo'ration, buL one of the estates o. the
realm.

2. But the grant is linited by the words of the charter iiself, to the churth of Englahid, as by law established, in th town of Pawlet. Just as the school right
is to be for the support of schools in that town, and the
right, of the minister, first to be settled there. Itis
hai'dly neeo-ssary to draw into the argument even the.
obvious intent of th6 grantor. The words themselves
are. unequivocal: and dues nt the Defendant himself
rest his- title 'upon his connexion with the Episcqpl.
society in Pawlet.?
As to the'laws of Vermont, before i805, they all show,
that.the legisla'ture acted on the opinion, that it might
dispose of these lands, as public property, in any way
it thought proper. It wis a question of expediency and
propriety; 'and provision is made, in some of the laws,
allowing- Epicop~l'.clergymen, already in possession, to
Temain seven years.
SWith respect-to the opinion ascribed to a latejudgo 'ot
this Court. it need only be re'arked, that if the cause.
turned on the point supposed, (which does not appear at
all from the record) it was but the opinion of an able
judge; formed and pronounced instantly, in the course
of a jury trial, without case reserved, or splemn argumenit; and it is no disrespect to say, possibly without a
khowledgd of all circumstances,, or-a full view of all consequences.

Fearne and Christian maiiiiain the contrary of Blackstone's opinioi-but that is not. at all this case. To
meet this case, the Defendants most slvw, that if a grant
be made tq a pc-rson not in esse, the land nevertheless
passes out of the grantor, and remains in abeynwo unfil, in the course of events, some person arises into being,
who answers the .descriltion in the grant.
4 . The observations already made are deemed a suffltient reply to the remarks of the .Defendants counsel
tinder this head.
5. It is not supposed poss ible to give in to the opinion,
that this is a trust estate, granted to the individuals
named in the charter. The idea is wlolly novel. Not
a syllable, in thie grant itself intimates- any such thing.
All is the other way. How can it be imagined, that the
int-ntion was to convey an estate in trust to a lIrgo
number of individuals; who were to be, at first, tenants
in common-then, to divide and hold in severalty-and
whose estates. by law, would descend, in gavei.kind,
to their heirs? Was B. 'Wentworth to be a trustee, whose
estate was severed by the charter itself? Was the corpo.
ration in England to be one of thw trustees ? It is hardly
necessary to add that the Court would not very willingly construe this grant so as to raise a-trust, which from
the nature of the cAise never could be execited.
This, thln, is a case, in which th highest Courts of
both stats -have concurred in giving to the grant
in question a practicable and beneficial construction ;
under which very -many estates, are holden, and the
Court would not incline to disturb these titles, but for irresistible reasons. It must b- remembered, thatthere are
two hundred townships, granted by charters precisely.
like this. In the Vhole, there are not probably more
than a dozen associations of Episcopalians. ' Iftho Court

&OTHURS.

If this case is to be considered, not as a reservation,
but a grant; and if this gr-int is not void. for want of a
grantee ; then, it must, of necessity, receive this consttirtion ; i.e. that it was in fact ftgrant for the use pf
such rainistry, br such religious purposes, as the tmov
should choose, or the. state appoint ; at least, unless the
church of England should have been established by law.
The general purpose was religious instruction. This
duty the laws of the state throw on the towns, and it is
a reas-inable construction which gives this fund, even
without any particular grant of the legislature, to the.
towns, for that purpose. This coistruction will answer
the general-object of the grant. In no other way can
any of its objects beanswered,, in one case out of fifty.
This puts it on the same ground as the grants fDr sclwols
and for the use of the vdnistryj, (a common grant in the
charters in the eastern part of New, Hampshire.) 'ho
main purposes-f the.grants were education, and religious
instruction-and,in .the events which have happened,
the most safe; and only practicable, construction is to
give the funds intended for the promotion of these purposes, to those on whom the law imposes the obligation
of making adequate provision for these objects. 1 eature to say such is the law of New Hampshire.
There is still another question, to which the Plaintiff's counsel wishes to draw the attention or the Court;
and that is, has the Court jurisdiction of the cause? Is
this a case coming within that clause of the constitution
which gives to this Court jurisdiction over - controver" sies between citizens of the same state, claiming lands
"by grants of different stated?" It is submitted, with
some confidence, that this is not such a case. These
two grants are ndt to be considered as the acts of diffeftnt states, in the sense of the constitution. At the time
of the first grant,- both the present states of New Hampphire antd Vermont formed but one state.. They have
become two) by subsequent sub-division. The first grant

lying east ,ofthat river Vermont, insted of tl'e revwrsed
it seems to the Plaifilif's counsel, tlat ii that case, the
'whole ground on which th jurisdiction of the Court
over this case rests, would have been removed.
It is easy to perceiive tme class'of cases, for which thi
provision was made; for example, when disputes ;ibout
boundaries between twb states arise. It is easy also to
imagine many bther cames, apparently within the letteri
and yet not within the menbig. and so excluded by a
just construction of the clause. These cases aris6 front
the sub-divisioh of states. One mayinagibe, f r exam-lle, that in the state of Kentucky, ,jectments must be
often tried, in which grants of Virginia bMfore the divi'sion, and grants of Kentucky sincei inight be respectively relied on by the parties ; and yet it would hardly
be contended that that circumstance should oust .tld
Courts of Kentucky of their jurisdiction, atid give the
cognizance of all such causes to the Courts of t:6 Un,
ted States. It might be said, in such case, that Ad
-grants emanated from differt-nt st.t, s ; and, nomunally,
they did so, Still 'they both' originated,, from a power
having.undoubted authority to grant the territory. The

as of the pai'elt of both states.. .Virginia, now, differs as
much from'*Virginia, before the severance, as Kentucky
now differs from Virginia before the severance. Kentucky has the same power over her-territory'now, as
Virginia had, over the same territory fov'merly. She is
therefore, as to this, to be cobsidered the same sovereign
power, in other'words the 8ame state. If integrity .f
territory-or retention of jurisditidn dyer the whole
of the same soil is necessary' to preserve the identity of
pblitical power, thenVirginia herself is not what shmo'zstt

say, that this case is certainly within the. literal pr-oi- D. CLAIM
sion of the c'mstitulion and it is presumed the Court %ill &o rmuns,
not search with solicitude to find a fdr-fetched tieaning
in repugnance to the letteil so long ;,s it can protluce no
other object than to send the parties to a trial in the
Courti of Vermont, where perhalis there is' not ajudge
to be found but is interested for or against the Plaintifr,
in this cause.
This is a case where the lands in dispute have been
granted by difftirent states ; that is, by New Hampshire
and Vermont.
N-ow, although these states were all tnder onejui, diction, yet when the land was granted by the state of Vermont, they were two sovereign, indepen 'eut At..tts. and
the same reason exists here, that ( an exist in any case
of state controversy. for depriving the states reslpectively
of the nower to determine the dispute.
It this cause is to be tried in Vermont, tit 1,..ges are
to decide under the very strong iupressions of a It.gislative construction, uneqtivcally made, of the grant; and
to give us what we claim as right, they must decide
against a positive statute of their legislatute. So far
therefore is th s case from beinag taken from the letter of
the constitution, by any equitable. construction with a
view to set up the spirit againstthe letter, thatit is within all the reasoning that governed the framers of the
constitution, and most perfectly within the meaning of
that clause; and one of the evils, which must have been
intended tohe guarded against, exists atfdL length, in
the present case.Why was the case of parties claiming land under ih
grants of diffrent 'states made cognizable before the
United States? Courts ? undoubtedly because ilire this
state of things exists it is reasonable to suppose tHrt the
judges ofthe states respectively will feer'strong plepssessi-ns and are. therefore unfit to decide the -trill, in relation to the powers and rights of the conilieting states,

STORY,

.edelivered the opinion of the "Court as fol-

lows ;
The first question pyesented in this case is, whether
the Ciurt has jurisdiction. The Plaintiffs claim tinder
a grant from the state ,f Vermont. and the Dv'lendants
claim uider a grant froi' the state of New Hampshire,
made at the time when the latter state comprehended
the whole territory of the foimer state. "The constitution of the United States, among .'ther things,, extends
the judicial power of the United States to controversies
d"between citizens of the same state claiming lands tin,,der grants of different'states.." It is argued that the
grant neuder which the Defeidants claim iq *notA grant
of. a dliflerent state within the meaning of tle cnstitution, because Vermont, at the time of its emanation, was
not a distinct government, bat was included in the sana
soyereignty as New Hampshire.
But it seems to us that there is nothing in this objectioi. The constitution intendd to secure an impar.tial
trib'nal for the decisitn of' causes arising from the
grant-i of diff'rent states; and it supposed that d'state
tribunal might not stand indifferent in. a controvprsy
wflri the claims of 'its ovn scw ri-ign iwere in conflict
with those of another soveri.n. It had no reference
whatsoever to the antecedent situation of the territdry,
whether included- in one sovereignty or another;' It
simply regarded the fact whether graqts, arose under the
f3ane or under different, states. NoW"'it is ver&' clear
th although thl territory of Verinont was oncts a part
of -New 'Haipshire, yet the state of Vermont, in its

FEBRUARY TERM iig.
sovereign capacity, is not, and never was the same as* T=
the state of NewHampslire. The grant of the Plain. TOWZ OF

same although it has lost a parr of its territw.; that-of Vermont never existed until its territory was separated from the jurisdiction of New Hampshire. The
circumstance that a part of the territory or populaltin
was once under a common sovereign no more makes
the states the same, than the circumstance that a part
of the membets df one corporation constitutes a cnmponnt part of another corporation, makes the corporation the same.. Nor cani it be affirmed, in any correct
sense, that, the grants are of the same state ; for the
grant of the Defendants could not have been made by the
state of Vernont, since that state had not at that time
any h-gal existenice; and the grant of the Plaintiffs
could not have'been made by New Hampshire. since. at
that. time, New Hampshire had no jurisdiction or sovereign existence by thi name of Vcimont. The case is,
therefore, equally within time letter and spirit of the
clause of"the constitution. It would, indeed, have been
a sufficient answer to the objection, that the constitution
and laws of the United Stat(-s, by the admission of Vermont into the union as a distinct government, had decided that it was a different state from that of New
lamptfire.
The other question which has been argued is no
without difficulty. It is cont,'nded by the Plaintiffs thalt
the original grant, in the charter of Pawhlt, of "one
ci share for a glebe for the church of England as by law
s established," is either void for want of a grantee, or
if it could take effect at all, it was as a public reservation, which, upon the revolution, devolved upon the
state of Vermont.

of these shares by the very terms of tie charter. The &oTnlRts.
grant is in the same. claus4e with that to the society Fir
the propagation of the gospel, and in the sime language, and oug!t, therefore, to receive the same construction, unless repugnant to the cinteXt, or nianit 'stly reilitiring a different one. It is very clear that the

and not a merely equitable estat. , and there would be
no repugnancy to.the context. in c.msidering the glebe,
in whomsoever it may be held to vest, as a legal estate.
We are further of opinion that the .three shares in
the bakhtei - . for a glebe." "-for the first settled ninster," and 6. f.ir school," are to be read in connexion,
soas ti)
irclode in each the words , in the said town,"

one share for the first settled minister in the town of
Paiblet, and one share for a school in the town of Paw.
lt.
We will now consider what'is the legal operation oP
such a grant at the common law; and how -far it is affected by the laws of New Hampshire or, Vermont.
At common law the church of Englantd, in its aggregate description, is not deemed a corporation. It is in.
deed one of the great estates of the realm; but is no
more, on that'acrount, a corporation, than the nobility
in their col.ctive capacity. The phrase, ii the church
of Englan'!," so familiar in our laws and judical
tieatisi5, is-nothing more than a compendious expres:
sion for the religious establishment of the realm, considered in the aggregate.-under the superintendance of its
spiritual head. In this sense the chuirch (ifEngland is
said to have peculiar rights and privileges, not as a corpior-ation. but as an ecclesiastical institution under the
patronage of the state. In this sense it is used, in maigna
cliarta, cit. 1, where it is declared ",quad ecclesia angli.
"cana libera sit, et habeat ontita jra sua integral et I-

SUPREME COURT U. S.
rIP-,
"bertates suas illcesas;" and lord Coke, in his common,oV.; WE tary on the.text, obviously so understands it, 2 Inst. 2,
PAWLSET 3.
The argument, therefore, that supposes a dunation
'. to ",the church of 'England," in its colictive capacity.
D. CLAPK to be good, cannot be supported, for no such corporate
&OTHERs body exists even in legal contemplation.
But it has been supposed that the "church of England of a "partiwcldar parish," must be a corporation
for certain purposes. although incapable of asserting its
rights and powers, except by its parson regularly inducted. And in this respect it might be likened to certain other aggregate corporations acknowledged in law,
whose component members are civilly dead, and whose
rights may be effe-tually vindicated through their esta.
blislicd head, thotigh during a vacancy of the headship
they reimain inert; siich are the common law "corpdralions of abbot and convent, and prior and monkE of a
priory. Nor is this supposition without thn countenance
of authority.
The expression, parish church, has various significations. It is applied somnetimes to a select body of
Christians forming a local spiritual association; and
sometimes to the building in which the public worship
of the inhabitants of a parish is celebrated; but the true
legal notion hi' a parochial cburch is a consecrated place,
having attached f6 it the rights of burial and the ad.
ministration of the sacraments. Com. Dig. Esglise, C.

some batural or corporate b,.dy ; for in no other way
can they be exercised or vindicated. And so is the
opinion of lord Coke in 3 IRst. 20t. 202, where he says,

"6albeit 'they" (i. e. subjects) "might build chuiri hes
"without te kings license, yet they could n(t erert

"cthey might hay, edo oed tlte spiritual body one, in66 corporated perpetuisfitturistemporibus, without an) icccense from the, king or any other."
This passage points clearly to the necessity of a spiritual corporation to uphold thb rectorial rights. We.
shall presently see whether th,, parish church, afit r consecration, waq deemed in legal intcidnent s.,ch PI orporation. In his learned treatise on tenures, I ,rd chief
baron Gilbert informs us that anciently, according to

The language of these passages would seem to consiier cathedral, conventual, and parochial churches as
corporations of themselves, capable of holding, lands.
But upon an attentive examination it will be found to be
io more than an abreviated designation of the nature,
quality and tenure of different ecclesiastical inheritances,
and that *the real spiritual corporations, which are, t.ci.ly referred to, are the spiritual heads of the pai-ticular
church, viz. the bishop, the abbot. and, as more impor.
tant to the present purpose, the parson, qui genit personam ecclesie.
Upon this ground it has been held in tho year books,

But in asmuch asthere was not any church duifyconsecrated and established In Pawlet at the time of the chartee, it becomes necessary further to enquire whether, at
common law, a grant so made, is wholly void for want
of a corporation having a capacity to take.
In general no grant can take effect unless there be a
sufficient grantee then in existence. This, in the case of
corporations, seems pressed yet further; forif there bean
aggregate corporation, having a head, as a mayor and
commonalty, a grant or devise mado to the corporation
during the vacancy of the headship is merely void ; although for some purposes, as for tife choice of a head,
the-corporation is still considered as having a legal entity, 13 Ed. 4.'s.8i Ed. 4, 8, Bro. Corporation.58, 59..Dalson,B. Si.--t A'ldl Corp. 106, O7,-FPerk. § 33, 50.
*Whcthier this doctrine has been applied ito parochial
churches during an avoidance has not appeared'in.,any
authorities that have fallen within our notice ; and perhaps can be satisfactorily settled only by a recurrence
to analogous principles, which have bleen applied to the
original endowmenuts of such churches.
We have already seen that no parish church, as such,
could have a legal existence until consecration ; and
c,,nsecraton was expressly inhibited unless upon a suitabl endowinent of land. '['he cannon law, following
the civil law, required such endowment to be made or at
least ascertained, before the building of the church waB
begur. Gibs. 19.-1 Burn's Eces. law, 233. This
endowm,,nt was in ancient times commonly made by an
allotnoit',t"imaose and glebe, by the lcrd of the manor,
who thereupon becam6 the,patron of the church. Other'.
persons also at the time. of consecration oftn contributed small portions of ground, which is the. reason, we ara
told, why, in England, in many parishes, the glloe is
not only distant from the manor, butlies in remote, divided, parcels, Ken. Par.Au: 222, 223, cited in I Biur's,
Ecdes. lavy, 2,,. The manner of founding the chu'ch
and making the allotment was for the bishop or his commissioner to, set up a cross and .set forth the ground
whre the clorch was to be built, and-it then became
the endowment of the church. Degge. p. 1, ch. 12, cited
1 Barn's, Fxedes. law. 233-

FEBRUARY TERM 185.
From this brief history of the foundation of parson-

Tn-

ages and churches, it is apparent that there could be no TowN or
spiritual or other corporation capable of receiving live- P.AWLnw
T
ry of seizin of the endowment of the church. There
".
could be no payron, for he could be indu ted into office D.cLn&K
boly as a parson of an existing churc', and the endow- &oTnnns.
nient must precede the establishment thereof. Nor is it
even hinted that the h'ul was conveyed in trust, for at
t is early period trusts were an unknown refinement.
The land therefore must have passed out (ifthe donors,
if at all, without a grantee, by way of public: appropriation or dedication to pious uses. In this respect it would
form an exception to the generality of the rule, that to
make a grant valid there must be a person in esse capa.
ble of takin. it. And under such circumstances until a
parson should be legally inducted to such new church,
the fee of its hands would remain in abeyance, or be like
the horeditasjacensof the Roman code in expectation of
_.n heir. This would conform exactly to the ductrife of
the civil law, which, as to .pious donations, Bracton has
not scrupled to affirm to be the law of England. I1es vero

:\or is this a novel doctrine in the common law. In
the familiar case wherea man lays out a public street or
highway, there is, strictly speaking, no grantee of the
casement,,but it takes efflect by w,ay of grant or dedication to public uses. Lade. v. Shepherd, 2 Str. :100+.

the ancient law; but in a modern case in which, in argument, the doctrine was asserted, lord Hardwicka did not
deny it, htt simply decided thatthe circumstaues of that
case did not amount to a dpnation of the land., on which

PF6r the reasons then that have been stated, a donation by the crown fur the rse 'of a non-existing parish

church, may well take eect by the common law as a
dedication to pious uses, and the crown would thereupnm
he deemed the patron of the future ben'.fice when brought

into life. And after such a donation it would not be
competent for the crown to resume, it at it, own will, or
alien the property without the same consent which is
necessary for the alienation of other chiurch property,
viz: the cotisent of the ordinary, and parson, if tho
church be full, or in a vacancy, of the ordinary alone.
And the same principies wouild govern the case berore

the Coui'tif it were to be decided upon the mere footing
of the common law.

-

Ifthe charter had been of a town-

ship in England. the grant of th, giheb. weuid havc taken
effect as a dedication to the parochial church of England to he established therein.
Belore such church were duly erected and consecrated the fee or thegleb would remain in abeyance, or at
least be beyond the pov.r of the arown to alien without
the ordinary's consent. Upon the erection and consecration of such a church 3nM the regular ind .ction of a
parson, such parson and his successors would. by opera.
ion of law and without further act, have taken the inheritancejure ecclesie.
Let us now see how far these principles were applica.
ble to New Hampshire, at the time of issuing of the charter of Pawlet.

New Hampshire was originally erected into a royal

FEBRUARY TERTN i815,
province-in the 31st year of Charles 2d, and from thence
Tux-;
until the revutution, contiffued a royal province, under ToWN 01
the. immediate control and direction of the crown. By 1P'AYLET
thefirst royal commission granted in Si, Charles2, among
-.
other things. judicial powers, in all actions, were grant- D. CLADx
ed to tie provincial g vernor and council, ",so always &oTnuS.
"that the forni of proceedings in such cases, and the

",judgment thereupon to bc given, be as consonant and
6, agreable to thelaws and statutes of this our realm of
"Englana,. us the presejit state and condition of our sub:Cjects inhabiting within the limits aforesaid (i. e. of the
'province) and the circums'tances of the place will ad*'.mit." Independent, however, of such a provision, we
take it to be a clear principle that the common law in
force at the emigration of owir ancestors is deemed the
birth -right of the colonies unless so fLr as it is inapplicable to their situation, or repugnant to their other
rights -and privileges. .tlfortiori tlhe principle applies
to a royal province.

By the same commissidn or charter the crown granted to the subjects of the province, ",that liberty of concscience shall be allowed to all Protestants,' and that
" such especially as shall he conformable to the rites of
66 the church of Ebgland shall be particularly countenanc"ed and encouraged." By a subsequent commission
of 15 Gee. 2, the governor of. tho province among other
things, is-autlhwized "cto collate any person or persons
"to any churches, chappels, orbther ecclesiastical bene"ices, within our said province., as often as any shall
cc happen to-be void," and this authority was continued
and cnfirmed in the same terms by royal commissions,
ini Gee. 3, and 6 Gee. 3.

By the provincial statute of

13 .Ann, ch. 43, the respective towns in the province were
authorized to choose, settle and maintain their ministers,
and to levy taxes for this purpose, so always tlfat no person who 'constantly and conscientiously attended public
worship according to another persuasion slfould be excused from taxes. And the respective towns were further authorized to build and repair meeting houses, minnister's houses and school houses, and to provide and
pay school-masters. This is the whole of the provincial
and royal legislation upon the subject of religion.
In as much as liberty of conscience was allowed ani

-had no legal. bxisten,'e in the province, Neither, upon
the establishment of churches, was a consecration by the

bishop, or a presentation of a p',rson to the ordinary, indispensible ; for no bishopric existed within the province.
But the coinmon law so far as it respected the erection
of churches of ttie Episcopal periuasion of Englind, the
right to present, or collate to such churches, and the corporate capacity of the parsons thereof to takt- in succession, seems to have been fully recognized and adopted.
It was applicable to the situation of the province,' was
avowed in the royal grants and commissions, and explicitly referred to iR the appropriation of glebes, in almost
all the charters of townships in the province.' Arid itseems to -k also clear that it befonged ,to the crown exbtusively, at its own pleasure, to erect the church in each
town that should be entitled to tske the glebe, and upod
such erection to collate, through the governor, a parson
to the benefice. The iespective towns in their corporate capacity had no control over the glebe ; but in as
much as they were bound, by the provincial statute, to
maintain public worship, and had therefore an interest
t,) be eased of the public burthen, by analogy to the
common law in relation to the personal property of the
parish church, the glebe could not, before the erection of
,a church, be aliened by the crown without their consent i
nor after the erection of a church and induction of a pars:1n, could the glebebe aliened without thejoint consent of
the crown as patron, the parson as persona ecclesie, and
the parishoneis of thc'church as having a temporal as
well as spiritual interest, and thereby in effect representing ttic ordinary.
But a were voluntary society of'Episcopalians within
a town, unauthorized by the crown, could no more entitle themselves, on account of their 'religious tenets, ''o
the glebe, than any other societi" worshiping therein.
The chinicli entitled, must be a church recognized in
law for this particular purpose. Whenever therefore,
within the province, previous to the revolution, an Episcopal church wasduly erected bytho crown, in any town,

FEBUARY TERM 1Wi.
the parsons thereof regularly inducted had. a i'ght to the

Where no such church TOwN. OV
was duly erected by the crown, the glebe remained as an 1,AWL.T

the vote of the town,* indirectly, its parson, who would
thereby become seized of the globejure ecdes-up-, and be

$leh.e in perpetual succession.

Such in ourjudgmentaretherights and privileges of the
Episcopal churches of New Hampshire, and the legal
principles applicable Lb the glees reserved in the various
to'wnships of that state previous to the revolution. And
without an adoption of soiiie 6f the common law in tho
manner which I have suggested, it seems very difficult
to give full effect to the royal grants and commissions,
or to uphold that ecclesiastical policy which the crown
had a right to patronize And to which it so explicitly
avowed its attachment.
It seems to~be tacitly, if not openly, conceded, that be:
fore the revolution, no regular Episcopal chu'ch whs established in Pawlet. By the revolution the state' of
Vermont succeeded to all the rights of the crown as to
the unappropriated as well as appropriated glebes.
It now therefore becomes material to survey the statutes which the state of Vermont has, from time to time,
passed on this subject.
By the statute of 26th otOctober, i787, the selectmen
of the respective to%ns were authorized during the then
septennnjr (which expired in 1792,) to take the care ,nd
inspection of the glebes and to lease the sam for, and
durihg the same term; andl further, to recover possession
of the same, where they had been taken possession of by
persons without title; but an exception is made in favor of ordairied Episcopal ministers, who during their
.ministry within the same term, were allowed to take the
profits of the glebes within tkeir respective towms.. Thi
statute. of "SOth October, i791, 'granted to their respective towns the entire property of the glebes, therein situatq,for the sole use and support of rcligious4orship;and

SUPREME COURT U. S.
THE

authorized the selectmen of the towns to lease and re-

TowN oF cover possession of such glebes. This act was velloaled
POWLET by the statute of the 5th of November, 1779. But by the

T.
D. CLARK
&OTHERS.

statute of the 5th of November, 1805, the glebes wiero
again granted to tile respective townts, for 1lc lisC o'he
schools of such towns; and pbwer'was g:vci to the selectmen to sue for possession of, and to jease the saime.
By the operation of these statutes, and esp,,ciall3 of
that of 1794., which, so far as.it granted the. ghebes fo the
towns, could not afterwards be repealed b3 tile legislature so as to divest the right of the towns under the
grant, the towns became respectiyely entitled to all tile
gilches situate therein which had not been prcvi,usly appropriated by th6 regular and legal erection of an Episcopal church within the particular town ; for in such
case the towns would legally represent all the parties in
interest, viz. the state which might be deemed the patron,
and the parish.
Without the authority of, the state, however, they
could not apply the lands to other uses than public worship; and in this respect the statute of 1805, conferred
a new right which the towns milt or might not exereise at their own pleasure.
Upon these principles the Plaintiffs are entitled to reoover, unless tle Defendants shew, not merely that before the year 1794, there was a society of Episcopalians
in Pawlet, regularly established according to the rules
of that sect, but that such society was erected by the
crown, or the state, as an Episcopal church (i. e. tile
church of England,) stablished in the towvn of Pawlet.
For unless it have such a legal existence, its parson cannot be entitled to the glebe reserved in'the present charter.
The statement of facts is not, in this particular, very
exact; but it may be inferred from it that the Episcopal society or church was not establishcd in Pawlet previous to tile year 1802. In what manner and by what
authority it was then established does not distinctly appear. As the title of the Plaintifts is however printafit.
cie good, and the title of the Defendants is not shown to
be sufficient, upon the principles which have been stated
the Plaintiffs would seem entitled tjudgment.

FEBRUARY TERM 180.
There is another viewof the subject which if any doubt
Tm
hung over that which has been already suggested would TrowN o
decide the cause in favor of the Plaintifrs. And it is PAWrLUT
V.
entitled to the more weight becauseit seems in analagous
cases to have received the approbation and sauctiin of D. clAzR
the stte Courts of New Hampshire. In the various &OTI s.
royal charters of townships in which shares have been
reserved for public purposes (and they are numerous) ib
has been held that the shares for telirst settled minister
and for the benefit of a school, weie vested in the town
in its corporate capacity ; in the lalter case as a fee simple absolute, in the former case as a base fee, determinable upon the settlement of the first minister by the
'town.

The foilndation of this construction is suplosed to be
that the town is by law obliged to maintain public warship and piublic schools;, and that therefore the legal title ought to pass to the town, Which is considered as the
real cestui que use. By analogy to this reasoning the
share'for a glebe might be dleemed to be vested in the
town for the use of an Episcopal church; and.then before any such church should be established, mid the use
executed in its parson, by the joint assent (if the legislature and the town, the land might at any time be appro.
priated to other purposes.
We do not profess to lay any particular stress on this
last consideration, because we am .ntirely satisfied to
vest the' decision upon the principles whish have been
before asserted.
On the whole, the opinion of the majority of the Court
is, that upon the special statement of facts by the parties;
judgment ought to pass for the Plaintiffs.
I6asog, . The difficulties in tWis case appear to mo
to arise from refining too much upon the legal principles relative to ecclesiastical lroperty under the laws of
Englana.
I find no difficulty in getting a sufficient trustee to
sustain the fee until the uses shall arise.
It is not material whether the corporation of Pawvlef
VOL. IX.
AS

SUPREME COURT U. S.
Tim

consist of the, proprietors or inhabitants.

The gratt

ToWN OP certainly vests the legal interest in the proprietor ; and it
PAIWV.LT is in nothing inconsistent with this idea to admit that

V.
the corporate powers of the town of Pawlet are vested in
D.CLARK the inhabitants. The proprietors may still well be held
&OTHERS. trustees, but the application of the trust may b subject
to the will of the whole combined population..
'I therefore construe this grant thus, we vest in you
so lnuch territory, by metes avid bounds, in trstito divide the same into sixty-eight shares ; to assign one
share in fee to each of you, the grantees, two to the gotenori one to the church of England- as by law establisJed, &c. This certainly would be a suflicienf conveyance to support the fee for the purposes prescribed.
But the diffitulty arises on thte meaning of the words
- chfirch of England as by law established." This was
unquestionably meant to set apart a share of the land
granted, for the use of that class of Christians known by
the description of Episcopalian's. But was it competent
for any man, or any number of men to enter upon this
land,,without any legal de.ignation or organization identiffing them to come within the description of personsifor
whose use this reservation was made? I tbink not.
Some act of the town of Pawlet, or 6f the legislature of
tihe state, or at least of Episcopal jurisdiction, became
necessary to give -form and consistency to the cestui que
iiei umitil such person or body became constituted and
#bcogniized. I see'nothing to prevent the legislaturo
itself from making an appropriation of this property.
Their controlling power over the corporate body denominated the toWn of Piwlet, certainly sanctioned such
an act; and 'before the act passed in this case thero
does not appear to have been in existence a person', or
body of men, in which the use could have vested.
I therefore concur in the decision of the Court.
