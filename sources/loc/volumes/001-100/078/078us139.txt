SMITH v. SAC COUNTY.
Syllabus.

by which the measure of damages is to be ascertained is not
before us, and we do not feel called upon to express any
opinion upon the subject.
The defences set up in the answer of the defendants are
clearly bad. The demurrer should have been sustained.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is REVERSED, and the
cause will be remanded with instructions to that court to
proceed.
IN

CONFORMITY TO THIS OPINION.

NVOTE.
AT the same time with the preceding case was decided
another case, which came here on certificate of division between the judges of the Circuit Court for Wisconsin. The
case, namely, of

FAitR v. THOMSON ET AL.
In which the preceding case was affirmed.

The declaration in this case presented, in all substantial respects, the same state of facts as the declaration in the case just
decided. After argument by Hr. X. .E.Carpenterfortheplaintiff,
no one appearingcontra, Mr. Justice SWAYNE announced the judgment of the court to the effect that the former case decided this.
The question certified to the.court-which was whether the
declaration showed a sufficient cause of action-was accordingly
answered by it
IN

THE AFFIRMATIVE.

SMITH V. SAC COUNTY.
1. In a suit on a negotiable security when the defendant has shown strong
circumstances of fraud in the origin of the instrument, this casts upon
the holder the necessity of showing that he gave value for it before
maturity.
