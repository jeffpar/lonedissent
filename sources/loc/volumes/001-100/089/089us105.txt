MARYLAND

v. RAILROAD COMPANY.

1. Although since the legal tender acts, an undertaking to pay in gold may
be implied, and be as obligatory as if made in express words, yet the implication must be found in the language of the contract, and cannot be
gathered from the 'mere expectations of the parties.
2. A reference to what are called "surrounding circumstances," is allowed
for the purpose of ascertaining the subject-matter of a contract, or for
al explanation of the terms used, not for the purpose of adding a new
and distinct undertaking.
3. An implication that a railroad company having an unfinished road in
which the State was largely interested should pay gold instead of currency to the State which has lent to the company sterling bonds of the
State, of which the interest was payable abroad, and, of course, in coin,
is not inferable from the fact that unless the contract between the company and the State be so interpreted, the State has not exacted from the
company allthat was necessary to its own complete indemnification ;
this being especially true in the case of a contract, where, in other
parts, a complete indemnification was specifically and careftilly provided
for, and in one where at the time it was made there was no difference,
existing or anticipated, in the value of currency and coin, and the difference having been brought about by events supervening long afterwards.

to the Supreme Court of Maryland; the case being

thus:
In the year 1826 the State of Maryland incorporated the
company now well known as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
Company, for the purpose of making a railroad from Baltimore to the Ohio River. The capital was $3,000,000; and the
State took one-sixth of it, or $500,000. The company was,
however, not able to make the road with the $3,000,000
capital thus originally subscribed; and in 1836 the legislature of the State passed an act "for the promotion of internal improvements,'&c.," meant to assist the completion of
the road.
By the first section the State authorized its treasurer to
subscribe $3,000,000, in instalments, to the capital of the
road, on certain conditions.
Its ninth section was as follows:
"Before any subscriptions shall be made by virtue of this act,

the stockholders of the said company shall stipulate, agree, and
bind the company . . . to guarantee to the State of Maryland,
aftr the expiration of three years from the payment by the
State of each of the instalments on the stock hereby authorized,
the payment from that time, out of the profits of the work, of
six per centum per annum, payable semi-annually, on the amount
of money which shall be paid to the said company by virtue of
this act, until the clear annual profits of th6 -said railroad shall
be more than sufficient to discharge the interest which it shall be
liable so to pay to the State of 3Maryland, and shall be adequate
to a dividend of six per centum per annum among its stockholders, and thereafter the State shall, in reference to the stock
so subscribed for, and on so much thereof as the State may hold,
be entitled to have and receive a perpetual dividend of sixper
centum per annum, out of the profits of the work as declared from
time to time, and no more, and all and so much of such annual
profits as shall exceed six per centum, shall be distributed to
the other stockholders according to their several interest in
said company."
The guarantee required by this section was given by the
company, and accepted by the State.
The act further provided for the appointment of commissioners to proceed to Europe to negotiate loans, and for the
issue of the bonds to raise money on behalf of the State to
satisfy the purposes of the act. The bonds were to be
issued, redeemable, at the pleasure of the State, after the
expiration of fifty years from their date, and to bear interest
at the rate of six per centum per annum, payable quarterly,
either at the loan office in the city of Baltimore, or at some place
in Europe, as might be arranged by contract. They were
not, however, to be sold at any rate which would yield to
the State less than twenty per cent. net, above par. Of
this premium, whatever part of it was not required to pay
the interest on the loan for three years after its negotiation,
was, with its increment, directed to be invested, in order to
constitute a sinking fund for the ultimate redemption of the
debt incurred.
The bonds were issued by the State, but the commissioner
sent to Europe was unable to negotiate them on the terms

prescribed by the act. The State then sold the bonds to the
company itself; but rated, as they had been by the State,
at $120, they proved to be unsalable by the company.
In this state of things the State passed, in 1838, an act
providing that upon the surrender of the bonds, the commissioner of loans should deliver to the company "an amount
of sterling bonds or certficales of stock to be redeemable in London,
at the pleasure of the State, at any time afterfifty years from
the date thereof, and to bear an interest of five per cent. per
annum, payable semi-annually in London, on the 1st day of
January and July in each and every year, equivalent to the
amount of bonds delivered up by the company." The act
continued:
"And in thus changing the bonds already issued under the
act aforesaid for the bonds hereby created, the said commissioner of loans shall give to'the said company in the proportion
of $3200 of the bonds or certificates of stock hereby created for
every $3000 of the bonds so to be delivered up.
"Provided, however, that the said company shall secure by
mortgage on all the property and revenues of said company to
the satisfaction of the treasurer, the payment of the interest at
the rate of five per eentum per annum on tire stock created by
this act, semi-annually, at least ninety days before the first day
of January and July, in every year, Foa THE TERM Or THREE
YEARS from the date of the bonds, together with the cost of trans-

mitting said interest to London to be there paid, and also the difference in the exchange of currency between London and the city of
Baltimore."
The bonds that were issued to.the company by the State,
under this act of 1838, owing to difficulties in disposing of
them to advantage, were not appropriated by the company
until about the year 1849, when they were placed on the
market in Europe, and sold. As they were disposed of, the
railroad company paid the interest on them as it accrued,
and all costs and difference in exchange, for the term of
three years; and after the expiration of that term it continued to pay such interest, cost, and exchange, by applying
directly the State's guaranteed dividend of six per cent. on

the stock subscribed under the act of 1836, instead of paying it over to the treasury. The company rendered no account, but treated the six per cent. dividend as equivalent
to the five per cent. sterling interest, with the costs and exchange; and this continued to be its course of conduct to
the 1st of July, 1865, from which time it ceased to apply the
six per cent. dividend as formerly, but paid it directly into
the State treisury in currency notes. "The State had been,
therefore, required, from the 1st of July, 1865, to the present
time to provide'for the payment of the sterling interest in
London, together with all costs and difference in exchange;
which, of course, had to be adjusted to a gold standard,
while it had been in the receipt of the six per cent. dividend in currency.
At the time that the company accepted the provisions of
the act, June 4th, 1836, and indeed up to the year 1861, the
matter was not one of practical importance. Coin (or paper
convertible on demand into it) was the currency of the
country. The law recognized no tender as valid but one in
coin; and in the case of this contract, as in all others made
at the time that it was (A.D. 1836), the expectation of the
parties, it was not denied, was that the contract would be
discharged in coin.
But in the year 1861, already named, a general suspension of payments in coin took place throughout the country,
and in 1862 and 1863, Congress authorized the issue of many
millions of notes of the United States, which by the acts
authorizing them were declared to be a tender in payment
of debts. This act, this court held to be constitutional;*
but the court also decided that a debtor could pay his debt
with legal tender notes only when his contract did not specify that payment should be made with coin-;t in other
words that a debtor might have defined the medium of payment as well as have promised to pay. So that after the
passage of these acts there were two kinds of money or rep* Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wallace, 457.

resentatives of values with which debts might be paid, coin
and legal tender notes; an ordinary debtor being at liberty
to pay in currency, though a debtor who had undertaken to
discharge his obligation by payment in gold or silver would
be held to his contract as specifically made.
Immediately on the issue of the sort of notes above mentioned they feill in value as compared with gold, and at many
times since had been greatly below it. At one time during
the summer of 1864 it required $285 in them to buy $100
in gold. The difference thus became vast, and it so happened that the payment, in gold, of five per cent., was the
payment of a much greater sum than would have been the
payment of six per cent. in the "legal tender notes" of the
United States; otherwise called "currency."
And as the
State had paid the five per cent. interest on its sterling bonds
in gold-the only way in which it could pay interest abroadit now, in the suit below, asserted that it was entitled to be
fully indemnified by the company, and to be repaid in gold
and not in currency. This the company denied, and the
question therefore was whether by the contract between the
parties, the State was entitled to demand in gold what was
payable to her, or whether it might be satisfied in legal
tender notek. The court below was of the opinion that it
might be satisfied in legal tender notes, and gave judgment
against the State. To that judgment the present writ was
taken.

due, the principal of what the State might bind itself in
form to pay. The proper interpretation of the acts of the
legislature construed together and in the liqht of surroundingcircumstances, an interpretation which must have been given at
the time by both parties, therefore is:
1st. That in practical effect the State only lent its credit
to the company to enable the latter to borrow money in
Europe; the cost of the transaction to be altogether borne
by the railroad company, and the State being the mere conduit through which that cost was to be conveyed from the
company to the European lender.
2d. That the transaction, though in the form of stock,
paying a fixed and preferred dividend, was, in effect, a
loan bearing the legal rate of interest of the State, six per
cent.; the form of stock being adopted to make the loan
irredeemable by the company at any fixed period, but at the
same time placing in the hands of the State a source from
which it could at any time after the success of the work became assured, realize the means of paying its own bonds in
Europe, and terminate the transaction.
3d. That this interest was payable in gold, not only because at the date of the transaction all legal demands were
solvable in gold only, but because, from the nature of the
transaction, gold only must have been in the contemplation
of the parties to it, as gold was the only medium within
the fixed rate of the contract which would keep the State
harmless.
That this was all so, stands to reason. The State was
bound to protect her own interest and that of her people,
and it must be inferred that she did not contract in a way
so loose as to expose herself and them to pay $2.85, and
more, when she got but $1 in return. Undoubtedly both
parties thought that what the company agreed to pay would
be enough to pay the interest on the State bonds; which on
the construction given to the contract id the court below it
never could do.

construction of the statutes of the State of Oregon, and this
court decided that when the statutes of the State required
the collecting officer to pay over the taxes to the State
treasurer in gold, it was required by legitimate, ift not necessary consequence, that the taxes should be collected in
gold, though the statute imposing the taxes made no mention of the medium in which they should be payable. We
refer to that case as an authority in point upon the implication of an obligation from the nature of the transaction. Now,
in the case we are considering, it was well known and understood between the contracting parties that the State was
to oblige itself by the tenor of its bonds, negotiable in Europe, to pay the principal and interest of the debt thus contracted in gold, and the only source provided by the same
contract for such payment was a stipulated amount to be
paid by the company to the State, and intended to be the
equivalent of the interest payable by the State. In order to
make it equivalent it is necessary to make it payable by the
company in gold; and is not the implication as logically
necessary in this case as it was in the Or-egon case?

Mr. Justice STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.
It is not contended in this case that the contract between
the parties contains any express undertaking to pay what
the company assumed to pay, either in coin or in any specified kind of money, or with anything other than that w ich
might be a legal tender for the payment of debts, vhen thi
time for payment should arrive. But the argument on behalf of the State is, that the language used implies an undertaking to pay in coin, and that the case is therefore within
the principle laid down in Trebilcock v. Wilson. Conceding
that such an undertaking may be implied, when there is no
express promise to pay in gold, still the implication must be
found in the language of the contract. It is not to be gathered from the presumed or the real expectations of the par-

ties. As was said in Knox v. Lee,* "the expectation of the
creditor and the anticipation of the debtor may have been
that the contract would be discharged by the payment of
coined nioneyj but neither the expectation of -one party nor
the anticipation of the other constitutes the obligation of the
contract. There is a well-recognized distinction between
the expectation of the parties to a contract and the duty
imposed by it. Were it not so, the expectation of results
would always be equivalent to a binding engagement that
they should follow." There is sound reason in what was
said by Lord Denman in the Queen's Bench, in Aspdin v.
Austin,t which was an action upon a covenant. " Where
parties," said his lordship, " have entered into written engagements with r express stipulations, it is. manifestly not
desirable to extend them by any implications. The presumption is that, having expressed some, they expressed all
the conditions by which they intend to be bound under that
instrument. It is possible that each party to the present
instrument," said he, " may have contracted on the supposition that the business would in fact be carried on and the
service in fact be continued during three years, and yet
neither party be willing to bind themselves to that effect;
and it is one thing for the court to effectuate the intention
of the parties to the extent to which they may have even
imperfectly expressed themselves, and another to add to the
instruments all such covenants as upon a full consideration
the court may deem fitting for completing the intention of
the parties, but which they, either purposely or unintentionally, have omitted. The former is but the application of a
rule of construction to that which is written ; the latter adds
to the obligation by which the parties have bound themselves, and is ot course quite unauthorized, as well as liable
to great practical injustice in the application." Applying
these principles, and looking to the contract, we discover no
basis for such an implication as the plaintiff in error asserts.
We are asked to consider the circumstances which at.

tended the legislative enactments, and induced them. The
State was then in part the owner of an unfinished railroad.
It was important to the interests of the people of the State,
as well as to the State as a stockholder, that the road should
be finished, and to accomplish its completion pecuniary
assistance by the State "was needed. For this purpose the
State lent her credit. This was the object she had primarily
in view. It is 'aid she had also in view her own protection
and that of her citizens against loss in so doing, and that it
must be presumed the legislature discharged its duty, and
made effectual provision for such protection. This is assuming what cannot be conceded. It assumes that it was
the duty of the legislature to exact from the company all
that could be exacted, and this though the company was in
great need of assistance, and though it was the interest of
the State that such assistance should be furnished. But if
the assumption might be made, it would still be inadmissible
to deduce an implication of a promise, not from the contract itself, but froni the extraneous fact that such a promise
ought to have been exacted. Ordinarily a reference to what
are called "surrounding circumstances" is allowed for the
purpose of ascertaining the subject-matter of a contract, or
for an explanation of the terms used, not for the purpose of
adding a new and distinct undertaking.
The plaintiff in error further insists that the contract, as
exhibited in the acts of the legislature, amounts to an engagement on the part of the company to indemnify the
State for the payments she was under obligation to make in
discharge of the interest upon her bonds, by means of which
the money was raised to pay her subscription to the company's stock; and as that interest could only be discharged
by gold, it is argued the company must be held to have undertaken to pay in gold, since payment by legal tender notes
would not amount to indemnity. But we see nothing in
the contract which justifies its being construed as a contract
of indemnity. It may be conceded, and it probably was the
fitct, that both parties thought what the company undeltook
to pay would suffice to pay the interest upon the State bonds,

from time to time as it should fall due. But nothing in the
statutes, read as a whole or read with reference to the required guarantee, or read in the light of the circumstances
then existing, exhibits any undertaking that the company's
stipulated payments should suffice to discharge the liabilities
of the State. On the contrary there is much in the statutes
to repel any possible implication of an engagement to indemnify, and to make it apparent that such an obligation was
not intended to be imposed or assumed. As has been
noticed, the company was required by the act of 1836 to
pay, after the first three years, six per cent. interest out of
the profits of the work, and pay it semi-annually, until the
net profits should be adequate to pay a six per cent. dividend, and thereafter pay a perpetual dividtnd of six per
cent annually. But the bonds first authorized to be issued
by the State to pay her subscription were bonds bearing six
per cent. interest payable quarterly, and running not less than
fifty years. The commissioners for their sale were also authorized to make the interest on the bonds payable at the
loan office of the State, in the city of Baltimore, or at some
place or places in Europe, should they find it advantageous
so to contract. It is manifest, therefore, that if the bonds
had been made payable in Baltimore, principal and interest,
the semi-annual payment required of the company would
not have met the obligations of the State, which were to pay
quarterly her interest. And if the bonds had been made
payable in Europe, still less would the six per cent. due
from the company, though paid in gold, have enabled the
State to pay her interest abroad. In addition she must have
paid exchange and the cost of transmission. This seems to
indicate clearly that the act of 1836 not only was not, but
that it was not intended to create an obligation to indemnify
the State. And this is not all. The bonds first issued were
,exchanged under the act of 1839, and sterling bonds bearing
five per cent. interest payable semi-annually in London were
-given to the company in their place. This act required the
company to secure the payment of the interest at the rate
of five :per centum per annum on the stock (the sterling

bonds) created by the act, semi-annually, at least ninety
days before the first day of January and July in every year
for the term of three years from the date of the bonds or
certificates of stock, together with the cost of transmitting
the interest to London to be there paid, and also the difference in exchange of currency between London and Baltimore. This was a stipulation for indemnity. It covered
all that the State was required to pay as interest on her
sterling bonds. But it was expressly limited to the interest
for the first three years, and hence it excluded any implication of an obligation to indemnify against all liability of the
State to pay the subsequently accruing interest. Unless this
is true the limitation to three years is unmeaning. After
the expiration of that period, nothing more was required
than the semi-annual payment of six per cent. as stipulated
by the act of 1836.
It is, we think, also a matter of some significance that by
the contract the payments to the State were required to be
made at first out of the profits, the gross receipts of the company. No distinction was made between the kind of money
the company might be compelled to receive and that required
to be paid to the State. Nor was any distinction attempted
to be made between the kind of money with which the dividends to the State and other stockholders could be paid.
For these reasons, we think, the contract between the
parties exhibits no just ground for an implication that the
company assumed an obligation to pay its dues to the State
in gold, or in any other manner than in money generally,
and the fact that the company did pay the State's interest in
sterling funds in London down to 1865, cannot change the
construction of the contract.
We do not perceive that the case of Lane County v. Oregon
has any bearing upon the present controversy.
