a proper substitute for the ingredient left out, which latter
qualification is entirely omitted in the instruction given to
the jury. (2.) But the instruction is also erroneous because
it would allow a patentee to secure in a reissued patent inventions for combinations fewer in number than the whole
described in the original patent, though the original patent
contained no description whatever of any such invention, in
violation of the express provision of the Patent Act and of
the decisions of this court.
JUDGMENT REVERSED

NEW VENIRE.

Mr. Justice STRONG concurred in the judgment, but not
in all the positions taken in the preceding opinion.
Mr. Justice BRADLEY did not sit, and took no part in
the judgment.

INSURANCE COMPANY V. NEWTON.
1. Every admission upon which a party relies, is to be taken as an entirety
of the fact which makes for his side, with the qualifications which limit,
modify, or destroy its effect. When, therefore, the agent and officers
of an insurance company stated to the agent of a party claiming upon a
policy of insurance that the preliminary proofs presented were sufficient
as to the death of the insured, but that they showed that the insured had
committed suicide, the whole admission must be taken together. If
sufficient to establish the fact of the death of the insured, it was also
sufficient to show the manner of his death.
2. The preliminary proofs presented to an insurance company, in compliance
with the condition of its policy of insurance, are admissible as primo
facie evidence of the facts stated therein, against the insured and on
behalf of the company.

pany, of Newark, New Jersey, upon two policies of insurance on the life of her husband, issued by the company's
agent at St. Louis.
The policies stipulated for the payment of the insurancemoney within ninety days after due notice and proof of the
death of the party insured, but they provided also that the
policies should be void if the insured should die by his own
hand.
In answer to the action, the company averred that the insured did thus die, and that the policies thereupon ceased
to be binding.
The insured died at Los Angeles, in California, in June,
1870, and proofs of his death were delivered by the father of
the plaintiff to the agent of the company in August following. These proofs consisted of several affidavits, giving the
time, place, and circumstances of his death, and the record
of the finding of the jury upon the coroner's inquest. The
finding was that the deceased came to his death " by a pistolshot fired by a pistol in his own hand through the heart."
On the trial, the father of the plaintiff testified that he
was the agent, in the matter of these policies, of his daughter,
and that, acting in that capacity, he had delivered the written proofs mentioned to the agent of the company at St.
Louis, and had demanded payment of him, and afterwards
also of the officers of the company at the home office in
Newark; that at neither place was any objection made
either by the agent or the officers of the company to the
form or fulness of the proofs of the death of the insured;
that the agent had said that they were sufficient as to form,
but that at both places objection was made, at the same time,
that the proofs disclosed a case of suicide, and on that account payment of the insurance was refused.
The plaintiff having closed her case, the company offered
as evidence the preliminary proofs of the death of the party
insured, and presented to the company by the father, a&
above said. The court excluded them, and the company
excepted. In -its charge, the court having referred to the
affidavits presented by the plaintiff, said:

Statement of the case.

"It appears that the company, upon receiving the affidavits,
claimed that they showed that Newton had taken his own life,
and refused to pay; and the agent has so testified on the stand
as a witness, and says the company never denied or doubted the
fact of Newton's death, and that the affidavits showed it; but
placed their refusal to pay upon the distinct and specific ground
that he took his own life, and that this fact appeared (as the
company claimed) from the proofs of loss furnished by the
plaintiff.
"Under these circumstances, the court instructs you that the
defence based upon want of notice and proof of death, is not
sustained.
"On the merits the company sets up the defence that the deceased ' died by his own hand;' that is, that he purposely took
his own life. This defence is met by a denial.
"This is an affirmative defence, and hence the burden of
showing, by a fair preponderance of testimony, that Newton
purposely took his own life, rests upon the defendant."
To this charge the defendant excepted, and verdict and
judgment having been rendered for the plaintiff the company brought the case here, on exceptions to the evidence
and to the charge.

INSURANCE

COMPANY V. NEWTON.

Opinion of the court.

Mr. Justice FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.
The court below allowed the statement of the company
and its agent to the witness as to the sufficiency of the
proofs of death of the insured to be received as conclusive
of that fact, but by its charge to the jury in effect separated
the admission of that fact from its accompanying language,
that the proofs disclosed a case of suicide, and held that this
latter statement was of an independent fact to be established
by the company. Iii this particular we think the court
erred. Every admission is to be taken as an entirety of
the fact which makes for the one side, with the qualifications which limit, modify, or destroy its effect on the other
side. This is a settled principle which has passed by its
universality into an axiom of the law. Here the admission
related to the two particulars which the proofs established,
the death of the insured and the manner of his death, both
of which facts appear by the same documents. They showed
the death of the insured only as they showed that he had
committed suicide, and all that the officers of the company
evidently intended by their declaration was that they were
satisfied with the proofs of the one fact because they established the other. The whole admission should, therefore,
have been taken together. If it was sufficient to establish
the death of the insured, it was also sufficient to show that
the death was occasioned in such a manner as to relieve the
company from responsibility.
But the court also erred in excluding from the jury the
proofs presented of the death of the insured when offered
by the company. When the plaintiff was permitted to show
what the agent and officers of the company admitted the
proofs established, it was competent for the company to produce the proofs thus referred to and use them as better evidence of what they did establish.
But independently of this position the proofs presented
were admissible as representations on the part of the party
for whose benefit the pqlicies were taken, as to the death
and the manner of the death of the itisured. They were
presented to the company in compliance with the condition

INSURANCE COMPANY V.

NEWTON.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

of the policy requiring notice and proof of the death of the
insured as preliminary to the payment of the insurancemoney. They were intended for the action of the company,
and upon their truth the company had a right to rely. Unless corrected for mistake, the insured was bound by them.
Good faith and fair dealing required that she should be held
to representations deliberately made until it was shown that
they were made under a misapprehension of the fiacts, or in
ignorance of material matters subsequently ascertained.
There are many cases which hold that where a mistake
has occurred in the preliminary proofs presented, and no
corrected statement is furnished the insurers before trial,
the insured will not be allowed on the trial to show that the
facts were different from those stated. The case of Campbell
v. The Charter Oak Insurance Company, decided by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts,* and the case of Irving v. The
Bxcelsior Insurance Company, decided by the Superior Court
of the City of New York,t are both to this effect. It is not
necessary, however, to maintain any doctrine as strict as
this in the present case; and possibly the rule there laid
down is properly applicable only where the insurers have /
been prejudiced in their defence by xelying upon the statements contained in the proofs. Be that as it may, all that
we now hold is that the preliminary proofs are admissible as
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein against the
insured and on behalf of the company. No case has come
under our observation, other than the present, where the
preliminary proofs presented by the insured have been entirely excluded as evidence when offered by the insurers,
the question being in all the cases whether these proofs
estopped the insured from impeaching the correctness of
their statements, or from qualifying them, or whether they
were subject to be explained and varied or contradicted on
the trial.
The case of Cl"ff v. The Mutual Benefit I6surance Company,
in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts,t cited by Lne plaintiff, is far from sustaining his position. There the bene* 10 Allen, 213.

Opinion of the court.

ficiary had submitted in connection with the preliminary
proof certain slips cut from newspapers showing reports
that the insured had died in known violation of law. On
the trial upon the issue whether the plaintiff had, ninety
days previous to the commencement of the suit, furnished
the company sufficient proof of the death of the insured,
the plaintiff put in evidence certain affidavits by which that
proof had been made, but did not offer the slips; the latter
were then offered by the company and were excluded, and
the Supreme Court, in reviewing the case, held that the exclusion was not a valid ground of exception unless it plainly
appeared that the insurers were prejudiced thereby, and
that they were not so prejudiced because the fact of death
was otherwise sufficiently shown. " When an apparent
ground of defence," said the court, "is disclosed by a separate and unnecessary narration of circumstances, and the
proofs required by the policy are complete without that
narration and disclosure, it cannot be said that the party
has failed to comply with the conditions imposed upon his
right to litigate his claim; and the effect of such disclosure
to defeat the action must depend upon the degree to which
the plaintiff is bound by the statement. If not sworn to by
the plaintiff, nor treated by him in such manner that he is
concluded by his conduct, the whole question will be open
to explanation and proof upon the main issue subject to the
usual rules of evidence."
In the present case the proofs presented were sworn to;
they consisted, as already stated, of affidavits and the record
of the finding of a jury under oath. Here the narration of
the manner of the death of the deceased was so interwoven
with the statement of his death that the two things were
inseparable. The fact that the proofs were presented by
the father of the plaintiff and not by the plaintiff herself
cannot change their character. They were the only proofs
presented, and without them there was no attempted compliance with the condition of the policies. He was the
agent of the plaintiff with respect to the policies, intrusted
by her with the presentation of the preliminary proofs.

CARY V. TE

SAVINGS

UNION.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

Presented in her name and by her agent in the matter, and
constituting the essential prelim.inary to her action, they
must stand as her acts, and the representations made therein
must be taken as true until at least some mistake is shown
to have occurred in them. As already said, no suggestion
is made that these proofs do not truly state the manner of
the death of the insured. It is sought, however, to avoid
their effect in favor of the company by taking a part of the
statement of its officers as to wtat the proofs showed, and
rejecting the residue, and then excluding the proofs themselves. This position cannot be sustained without manifest
injustice to the company.
The judgment must, therefore, be
REVERSED, AND A NEW TRIAL ORDERED.

such share of profits is a "dividend" within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Act of 1864, as amended by the act of 1866, and not
