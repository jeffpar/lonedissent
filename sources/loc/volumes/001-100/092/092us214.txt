UNITED STATES V. REESE ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

Conceding that amnesty did restore what the United States
held when the proclamation was issued, it could not restore
what the United States had ceased to hold. It could not give
back the property which had been sold, or any interest in it,

CA.FFRATX V. SKIFF.
The doctrine announced in the case of Wallach et al. v. Van Riswick, supra,p. 202%
reaffirmed.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Louisiana.
Mr. Conway Bobinson for the appellant, and Mr. John A.
Campbell for the appellee.

iR. JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.
The court below decreed specific performance of a contract
for the purchase of real estate, which expressly stipulated that
the purchaser should not be bound to accept the sale if the
titles were not good and valid. The title offered was that of
a purchaser at a confiscation sale, to whom, after the sale,
Surget, the person as whose property the land was confiscated,
had released, without warranty. We decided, in Wallach et al.
v. Van Riswick, supra,p. 202, that such a title is not a complete
and valid one; that it is ineffective beyond the life of Surget;
and that his release did not enlarge it.
-Decreereversed.
