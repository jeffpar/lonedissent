DICKINSON V. THE PLANTERS' BANK.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

DICKINSON V. THE PLANTERS' BANK.
1. Although under a stipulation in writing made by the parties to the suit,
and filed with the clerk of the court, in pursuance of the act of March
3d, 1865, which gives to the finding of the court (which may be either
general or special) the same effect as the verdict of a jury, this court
can, where the finding is special, consider the sufficiency of the facts
found to support the judgment, yet, returning in the record all the evidence in the case, where the court, in an action of assumpsit on a
check or draft, does not find what the evidence proves, nor any ultimate fact except one stated in the judgment, to wit: "That the defendant did not assume and promise as the plaintiff in declaring has
alleged-,"-does not give this court jurisdiction to consider such sufficiency.
2. The fact that the court below, in an opinion which accompanied the judgment, has stated some of the facts of the case does not alter things; the
facts stated not being stated as a special finding, but rather advanced to
show why the judge came to the conclusion that the alleged promise
had not been proved.

ERROR to the Circuit Court for the District of Tennessee;

the case being thus:
One William Dickinson, a manufacturer of salt at Kanawba, in that part of Virginia now called West Virginia,
had an agent selling the salt in Tennessee and thereabouts.
By direction of Dickinson, this agent took the proceeds, and
with them bought a draft of the Planters' Bank of Tennessee, at Nashville, on the Bank of Virginia, at Richmond; the
former bank crediting the latter with the amount. The
draft was in this form:
$5224.25.

the date of the draft, Dickinson had died. Accordingly, on

DICKINSON V. THE PLANTERS' BANK.
Statement of the case.

arriving, December 6th, at Kanawha, he handed the draft
and other papers connected with his agency to Dickinson's
son, also named William Dickinson, who, by a will that the
father had left in a bank at Lynchburg, Virginia, was appointed executor of the father's estate. These were times
of the rebellion, and Lynchburg, Nashville, and Richmond
were all within the Confederate lines, having at the time
and for some time afterwards communication with each
other, while Kanawha, being in West Virginia, was within
the lines of the Federal government, and had no intercourse
with any of them. Dickinson, the son and executor, was
quite desirous to get the money on his draft, but being reputed to be a "Union man," could not with safety go to
Lynchburg, to get his father's will, or to Richmond, between
which and Kanawha, from 1862 till the surrender of the
rebel army in 1865, there was no lawful intercourse. He,
however, indorsed the check with his own name, identical
with that of his father, and by that means sought to negotiate it through a Virginia bank. It being known, however'
at the bank to which he applied, that the "William Dickinson" named as payee, was the father and not the son, and
the will not having been yet proved, no negotiation of the
draft could be made. Dickinson, the son, then, March, 1864,
applied to the Federal headquarters for a pass to get through
the Union lines, but was refused; nor could he get any pass
till February, 1865, when getting papers from the headquarters of both armies, and having got the will and had it
proved, he went to Richmond in the latter part of May, 1865,
which the evidence went to show was as soon as he could
get there, and indorsing his draft properly, presented it for
payment. Payment was refused, the bank having recently
become insolvent. He then had the draft protested by a
notary, and directed the notary to give notice of the dishonor to the Planters' Bank of Tennessee at Nashville, and
that the holder would look to that bank for payment. A
notice to the Planters' Bank of Tennessee was accordingly
deposited by the notary in the post-office; but that it was
directed to the Planters' Bank of Tennessee at Nashville,

Statement of the case.

Tennessee, was not so clearly shown. The cashier of that
bank testified that he received no notice. It was not denied
that the Bank of Virginia, at Richmond, had funds during
all this time of the Planters' Bank.
Dickinson, as executor of his father's estate, now brought
assumpsit in the court below, against the Planters' Bank of
Tennessee. The narr contained two counts; the first special
on the draft; and the second for money had and received.
The bank pleaded the general issue, and on the trial relied
apparently in part on the non-intercourse act of July 13th,
1861 (chapter 3), and the President's proclamation of August 16th of the same year. The parties having taken depositions on both sides, "filed," as appeared by a recital in the
judgment in the case, "a stipulation in writing with the
clerk of that court, waiving a jury, and the cause came on to
be tried and determined by the court."
An act of March 3d, 1865, thus enacts:
"SE TION 4. That issues of fact in civil cases in any Circuit
Court of the United States, may be tried and determined by the
court without the intervention of a jury, whenever the parties
or their attorneys of record file a stipulation in writing with
the clerk of the court waiving a jury. The finding of the court
upon the facts, which finding may be either general or special,
shall have the same effect as the verdict of a jury. The rulings
of the court in the cause in the progress of the trial, when excepted to at the time, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court
of the United States upon a writ of error or upon appeal, provided the rulings be duly presented by a bill of exceptions.

When the finding is special, the review may also extend to the

determination of the sufficiency of the facts found to support
the judgment."
The court gave an "opinion " and subsequently a judgment. They were in these words.
OPINION.

The court, after hearing the testimony and argument of counsel on both sides, is of opinion, and doth declare that the bank
check drawn by the Planters' Bank of Tennessee on the Bank
of Virginia, at Richmond, on the 14th of November, 1861, was

Statement of the case.

so drawn by the request of the agent of William Dickinson, the
plaintiff's testator, and in pursuance of the instructious of said
'William in his lifetime; that the said contract was not an illegal
transaction according to the provisions of the non-intercourse
act of July 13th, 1861 (chapter 3), and the proclamation of thi
President of the 16th of August, 1861, as it was drawn at Nash
ville on Richmond, both of which were in the lines of the Con,
federate or rebel government, and no agreement existing tha',
it was to be sent beyond those lines, where intercourse was prohibited; that at the time when said check was drawn, and for
several weeks afterwards, there was regular communication
by mail and railroad between Richmond and Nashville, and the
Planters' Bank drew checks from time to time,until the latter part
of February, 1862, for considerable sums of money, which were
paid by said bank at Richmond, and that at the time of drawing the check of the 14th November, 1861, and during the whole
period of the civil war, and afterwards, the Planters' Bank had
funds in the said Bank of Virginia, at Richmond, and that said
bank is now indebted to the Planters' Bank of Tennessee in a
large sum of money, and that said Bank of Virginia is insolvent.
It farther appeared to the court that, on the day of the drawing of the check by the Planters' Bank specified in the declaration, a credit was given on their books to the said Bank of
Virginia for the amount of said check so drawn.
This court is of opinion, and doth declare that this check,
when executed and delivered to the agent of William Dickinson, was an absolute appropriation of so much money in the
Bank of Virginia to the holder of the check, to remain there
until called for, and could not, therefore, be afterwards withdrawn by the drawers. If'the holder of the check chose to
transmit the same to the country with which intercourse was
prohibited, and by the casualties of war or other accidents, it
was rendered difficult or impossible to present the check for
payment, and the bank on which it was drawn became insolvent, the drawer of the check having the funds in the Virginia
bank would not be responsible for the loss by such insolvency.
This court is also of opinion that there is not sufficient evidence of a notice to the defendant of the demand and protest of
the check, which protest was made on the 80th of May, 1865.
The cashier of the bank received no notice, as he states in his
testimony, and it is not proved that the notice was directed ta

Nashville, the place of business of the defendant, but only to
the Planters' Bank of Tennessee.
The plaintiff's counsel excepted to the opinion and rulings of
the court, discharging the defendant from responsibility upon the
draft sued on.
The plaintiff further requested the court to find and so decide,
that William Dickinson, the owner of this draft, having died in
Virginia, on the 15th day of November, 1861, the day after the
draft was made and delivered to his agent Creasey, that it made
no difference and could not change the responsibility of the
party by its being on the 6th of December, afterwards carried
to Kanawha, the late residence of William Dickinson. Because
if it had been retained in Tennessee and sent directly to Rich-

mond, it could not have been presented and paid only to the
legal representative of William Dickinson, deceased. That
William Dickinson, the executor, was residing at Kanawha, and
the will was in the Lynchburg Bank of Virginia. That he
could not prove the will and qualify as executor before he did,
and was unable to go to Richmond and have the draft presented
and protested before he did, and consequently the plaintiff had
a right to recover.
The plaintiff requested the court to decide from the facts and
circumstances proved, due notice of the protest was given the
defendant. The plaintiff requested the court to decide that the
plaintiff under the second count had a right to recover, for so
much money had and received by defendant to his use; all of
which requests made by the plaintiff the court refused to comply with, but rendered judgment against the plaintiff for costs
of suit.
To which action of the court the plaintiff excepts, and tenders this his bill of exceptions, which is signed and sealed by
the court, and made a part of the record.

Argument for the plaintiff in error.

having heard the evidence and argument of counsel on both
sides, the court is of opinion that the issues are in favor of the
defendant, and that the defendant did not assume and promise
as the plaintiff in declaring has alleged. It is therefore considered by the court that the defendant recover of the plaintiff
the costs by it about its suit in this behalf expended; and that
ft. fa. issue for the same.
This judgment was brought here for review.
The record reported what purported to be all the evidence in the case; a large number of depositions, from
which the facts as given, supra, pp. 250-252, were derived
by the reporter.

.Mr. Beverdy Johnson (with whom was .Mr. HB.
for the plaintiff in error, assuming that the facts stated as
above by the reporter, or others like them, and those stated
also by the court in its opinion, was the case now before this
court, argued that the rulings of the court below were erroneous, and that the judgment should be reversed.
L Because, under the circumstances, appearing in the
record, in tbe,depositions of the witnesses, if the jury believed the evidence-and it was for them to pass upon itit was impossible fbr the plaintiff to have presented the
check for payment sooner than he did. Now the rule of
law in such cases is, that demand is to be made within a
reasonable time, and that what is a reasonable time is for
the jury, to be decided upon a consideration of all the circumstances.
II. That the judge erred in deciding that if the demand
was in time, notice of non-payment was not properly given
to the defendant, because the notary's letter containing the
protest, was not directed to Nashville, but only to the
Planters' Bank of Tennessee. Because1st. If the evidence proved only that the notary's letter
was directed to the bank generally, and not to Nashville,
under the circumstances the jury might have inferred that
it reached Nashville in due course.
2d. Because in fact there was evidence in the testimony

of the plaintiff and of Johnson, that the notary's letter was
directed to the defendant at Nashville.
M'r. Conway Robinson, contra:
The trial must be taken to have been under the act of the
3d of March, 1865, and the finding of the court upon the
facts being general, its finding has the same effect as the
verdict of a jury. When there are no rulings in the progress
of the trial, which can be reviewed, the finding of the court
stands like a verdict; and the judgment on the finding
stands like the judgment on a verdict. There being "in the
progress of the trial," no rulings of the court-none "excepted
to at the tine,"-none shown to be erroneous, the judgment
on a general finding, like the judgment on a general verdict,
must be affirmed.* Such is the case here. The plaintiff in
error is in the same position as if he were here complaining
that the jury erred in overruling the points and propositions
which were argued to them in his behalf, and had found for
the defendant when they should have found for the plaintiffit
Clearly, it is so as to all that follows these words on p. 254:
"The plaintiff further requested the court to find and so decide."
And as to all that follows these words on the same page:
"The plaintiff requested the court to decide from the facts
and circumstances proven."
Mr. Justice STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.
It is very clear that in this case there was no special finding of facts upon which any judgment for the plaintiff could
have been rendered. The suit was an action to recover the
amount of a check dated November 14th, 1861, drawn by

257

Opinion of the court,

the defandants in error upon the Bank of Virginia, at IRichmond, and payable to the order of the plaintiff's testator.
To the declaration the defendants pleaded the general issue,
and the parties, by written stipulation filed with the clerk
of the court, waived a jury. It is true that no such stipulation has been sent up with the record, but in the judgment
it is recited that such a one was made and filed. We
must, therefore, hold that the issue was tried by the court
under the act of March 3d, 1865, which gives to the finding
of the court upon the facts (which finding may be eithez
general or special), the same effect as the verdict of a jury.
It is, however, only when the finding is special, that the re.
view of this court can extend to the determination of thi
sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment.
Here the record as returned contains what is stated to
have been all the evidence in the cause, but the court has
not found what the evidence proves, nor any ultimate facts
except that stated in the judgment, "that the defendant did
not assume and promise as the plaintiff in declaring has
alleged." Some facts indeed are stated in the opinion of
the court, that seem to have accompanied the judgment, but
they are not stated as a special finding. They are rather
advanced as reasons why the judge came to the conclusion
that the alleged promise of the defendants had not been
proved. It is impossible to regard anything that appears in
this case as equivalent to a special verdict. Plainly to a recovery by the plaintiff it was indispensable that the check
drawn in favor of his testator had been presented for payment in a reasonable time, or that there had been a sufficient excuse for non-presentation, and that notice of its dishonor had been given duly to the drawers. These were
questions of fact submitted for determination to the court.
But it nowhere appears in the finding, when, if ever, the
check was presented, or if presentation was delayed what
circumstances caused the delay, or whether the delay was
reasonable or unreasonable. Nor is it found what notice,
if any, was given to the defendants of the dishonor of the
check. So far as anything appears, it is in the opinion of
17
voL. XVI.

253

INSURANCE COMPANY V. COMSTOCK.

[Sup. Ct.

Syllabus.

the court, which was that "there was no sufficient notice of
the demand and protest of the check, which protest was
made on the 30th of May, 1865."
We cannot, therefore, inquire whether the evidence as detailed by the witnesses was sufficient, under the circumstances, to justify a finding that the presentation and demand
were made in a reasonable time, or whether it might have
been inferred that notice of non-payment )was duly given.
But though the finding was general, any rulings of the
court in the progress of the trial, if excepted to at the
time and duly presented by bills of exceptions, may be reviewed by us. This is provided by the act of 1865. Manifestly, however, the rulings thus subject to review are decisions of law, not findings of fact. Some requests appear
to have been submitted to the court to find certain facts,
which were refused. They are no more the subject of exception and review than would be a request to a jury to find
in a particular manner, and a refusal by the jury so to find.
One request also was that the court should decide that the
plaintiff had a right to recover under the second count of
the declaration, for money had and received. This also was
refused, and so far as we can see, very properly. The record
presents nothing which would have justified such a decision.
There is nothing else in the case that requires notice.
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
