FLORENCE MINING CO. v. BROWN.

FLORENCE MfINING COMFANY
APPEAL

FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT

OF

. BROWN.

THE UNITED STATES FOR

THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
Argued December 1, 2, 1887. -Decded

January 23, 1888.

The insolvency of the vendee in a contract for the sale and future delivery
of personal property in instalments, payment to be made in notes of the
vendee as each instalment is delivered, is sufficient to justify the vendor
for refusing to continue the delivery, unless payment be made in cash;
but it does not absolve him from offering to deliver the property in performance of the contract if he intends to hold the purchasing party to
it: he cannot insist upon damages for non-performance by the insolvent
without showing performance on his own part, or an offer to perform,
with ability to make the offer good.
A check upon a bank in the usual form, not accepted or certified by its
cashier to be good, does not constitute an equitable assignment of money
to the credit of the holder, butis simply an order which may be countermanded,'and whose payment may be forbidden by the drawer at any time
before it is actually cashed.

FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.

In February, 1883, three corporations, namely, the Lake
Superior Iron Company, and the Jackson Iron Company,
created under the laws of Michigan, and the Kegaunee Concentiating Company, created under the laws of New York,
filed a bill in chancery in the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Northern District of Ohio against the defendant,
Browin, Bonnell & Company, a corporation created under the
laws of Ohio, alleging that they were creditors of the latter
corporation, and .designating the amounts of such indebtedness; that owing to the first two named corporations -onsistVOL. CXxLv-25

ing of certain promissory notes of the defendant, and that
owing to the last named corporation being a judgment against
the defendant in the Circuit Court rendered on that day. The
bill purported to be filed, not ,only on behalf of the complainants, but also on behalf of all other creditors whom it represented to be so numerous that it was impossible to make them
parties. It alleged that the defendant-was insolvent; that it
had long been engaged in the business of manufacturing iron,
and had erected blast furnaces, rolling mills, and coke works,
and had opened and operated coal mines; that its plant was
of great value; as was also the good will of its business; and
that it employed at least 4000 persons in its mills and works.
It also alleged that vexatious litigation had been commenced
against the defendant, and more was threatened; that such
litigation was accompanied by attachments and seizures, of
property, and the threatened litigation would also be accompanied by like attachments and seizures, and they would give.
to the creditors who were pursuing them undue advantage.
over those complainants whose claims were not yet due, and
work them irreparable injury; and that if such litigation
should be further instituted, and the property of the defendant.
be attached, there was danger that it would be to a great.
extent destroyed, and its long established business broken up.
It therefore prayed the appointment of a receiver to take
charge of the assets and property of the defendant, and for
further relief.
The defendant appeared at once t6 the bill, and thereupon,
pursuant to the complainant's motion, Fayette Brown was
appointed receiver of its assets and property.
In M arch, 1883, a supplemental bill was filed, setting forth
that the property of the defendant was of such a peculiar
nature that great and irreparable loss would be caused to the.
complainants and other of its creditors, unless its property
should be preserved by the receiver in its entirety as a business
during the time required to liquidate and adjust its affiairs;
that the Negaunee Concentrating Company, one of the complainants, had recovered judgment against the defendant prior
to the filing of the bill; that its recovery gave to the company

Opinion of the Court.

a lien upon all the real estate of the defendant within the
jurisdiction of the court; that execution had been issued upon
said judgment and been returned unsatisfied; that other claims
for liens and priorities of payment had been made by creditors
of the defendant, both secured and unsecured; and that many
claims were made, the justice of whicth was doubtful, and many
which were unliquidated. It therefore prayed the appointment of a special master to ascertain the priorities of liehs and
the rights and claims of creditors generally, and report to the
court his findins;
The court thereupon made an order requiring all the creditors of the defendant to file their claims in the office of the
clerk by petition' stating their amount and nature; and in
July following it appointed the special master prayed to
determine the rights of the several creditors of the defendant
who had, in accordance with its previous order, fied their
claims with the clerk, and to marshal the liens and priorities
of such claims.
Among the claims filed with the clerk pursuant to this
order was one presented by the Florence Mining Company,
a corporation of Michigan, for an amount alleged to be due to
it upon a contract with Brown, Bonnell & Company for the
sale of certain iron ores. Among the transactions had under
the contract a check was given to the Florence Mining Company by Brown, Bonnell & Company, shortly before its failure, upon the Importers' and Traders' National Bank of New
York, on account of a cash payment then due, which check, it
was contended; operated as an equitable assignment of certain
moneys then in the bank to its credit.
These matters were considered by the special master, who
took testimony respecting them, and heard counsel thereon.
Ile reported the amount due the Florence Mining Company,
deducting from the price for the whole orewhich was to be
delivered the value of the quantity undelivered, estimated
according to. the contract price, and he reported against the
alleged equitable assignment. Exceptions to his repoit were
overruled, and the report was confirmed. To review this ruling the case is brought here on appeal.

OCTOBER TERM; 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

The contract between the Florence Mining Company and
Brown, Bonnell & Company was made on the 13th of Febru-'
ary, 1882. By it the Florence Mining Company agreed 'to
sell to Brown, Bonnell & Company 30,000 gross tons of Florence iron ore, of its standard quality, deliverable at Cleveland
and Ashtabula, during the season of navigation of 1882, at the
docks of the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railway
Company, or of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Company, and as near one-sixth of the total quantity per
month, as practicable; "said ore to be paid for by the said
Brown, Bonnell & Company at the rate of $5.75 per ton, in eight
equal paymeiits"of $21,562.50 each, payable on the 15th days
of May, June, July, August, September, October, November,,
and December next, respectively, in cash, all in funds par in
Cleveland or New York, making a total of one hundred and
seventy-two thousand five hundred dollars' ($172,500). The
said ore is to be consigned to Florence Mining Company, and
to be subject to their order until forwarded from docks. It is
further agreed that promissory notes of Brown, Bonnell &
Company, drawn at four months from date, on which a cash
payment is due, with interest at the rate of six per cent per
annum, added into the face cf note (making $21,993.75), may
be substituted for either of the above cash- payments except
the last two due in November and December next, which are
to be paid only in cash. Said Brown, Bonnell & Company for
the above named consideration -hereby agrees to buy, -receive'
and pay for said ore*as above mentioned."
The Florence Mining Company had the ore on thQ docks
designated by November 1st, 1882. It was all consigned tothe company, as provided in the contract, aid no part of.it was
delivered to the vendee except upon the order of the company,
which continued the owner of the ore not delivered. Shipments to the vendee were during this period, that is, from the
date of the contract until November 1st, 1882, suspended at
the vendee's request for about two months, but at other times
shipments were made as the ore was wanted. Prior to February 19th, 1883, the vendor haddelivered to the vendee 20,762
tons of the ore, and had the remaining 9238 tons on hand,

FLORENCE MINING CO. v. BROWN.
Opinion of the Court.

when the vendee became insolvent, and the receiver of its
assets and property was appointed by the court. On the day
previous to this appointment, the vendor, having reason to
fear the insolvency of the vendee, ordered the suspension of
any further shipments of ores. No shipments to the vendee
were subsequently made, nor did: the vendor offer to make
any, or give notice that it was ready to deliver the ore. The
statement of its agent, that he asked the receiver to buy ore
of the company, does not show any ofter to deliver the ore
under the contkact, nor was it intended as such proof. In its
petition setting forth its claim, filed, with the clerk of the
court, the company alleged that it was at all times ready,
willing, and able to perform the contract on its part, but that
the vendee, by reason of its insolvency and the -appointment
of areceiver, was unable to take and pay for the ore remainiig undelivered. These allegations were not admitted before
the. special master; but, if true, the fact would not constitute
any performance of the contract on its part without an: offer
to deliver the balance, .or, at least, without notice to the
vendee, or its receiver, of a readiness to do so. The "insolvency of one party to a contract .does not release the other'
from its obligations, provided, always, the consideration promised, if money, be paid, or if the consideration be the note or
other obligation of the insolvent, money be tendered in its
place. The. mining company contended that it should be
allowed the difference between the contract price of the undelivered ore, $5.75 per ton, and the market price for it at the
time of the appointment of the receiver, which was only $4.50
per ton, making a difference of $11,577. This contention
rested, as we have seen, solely upon the fact of the insolvency
of the vendee before the whole of the ore was delivered; but
that fact, if excusing the delivery of the balance without payment, did not release the company from offering to deliver
the property in performance of the contract, if it intended.to
hold the purchasing party to the contract. It could not insist
upon damages for non-performance of the contract by the
other party without showing performance or an offer to perform it on its part with an ability to inaie good the offer if
accepted.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

Nor did the vendee or its receiver call upon the vendor for
the balance of the ore and offer cash in payment. Its nonaction for the enforcement of the contract and its silence on
the subject was evidence that it desired to rescind the contract; and the action of the vendor, its suspension of further
shipments to the vendee, and subsequent failure to deliver the
balance of the ore, or to call upon the vendee to comply with
the contract, was evidence that it also desired to rescind the
contract. The master was therefore justified in holding that
the contract was in fact rescinded by -the consent of both
parties.
Numerous cases have been cited to us upon the conduct
which a vendor should pursue to preserve his rights under a
contract for the sale of goods on credit, when he has refused
to proceed with its performance upon learning of the insol-.
vency of the vendee, but they exhibit so much difference of
judicial opinion on the subject that it is difficult, if not impossible,,to reccncile them. Some of the divergences of opinion
may perhaps be traced to the different position of the vendor
where he has sold the goods on credit, the title passing imme-,
diately, but has stopped some of them intransitu, and where
he has fnerely contracted to sell the goods, the delivery to be
made by instalments, and payment made -with each delivery,
the title only then vesting in the vendee. However this may
be we do not deem it necessary to go over the cases in an
attempt either to reconcile or'explain them. We rest our
present decision on the fact that the conduct of vendor and
vendee in this case justified the conclusion that they both
assented to the rescission of the contract.
Upon the second point, as to the alleged equitable assignment of the funds in the bank against which the check was
drawn by Brown, Bounell & Company, and given to the
Florence Mining Company, we do not think there can be any
serious question .of the correctness of the "master's decision.
The check was not drawn against any particular fund. There
was, indeed, n6 fund out of which it could have been paid.
There was only a little more than one-fifth of its amount on
deposit at the time to the credit of the drawer. The notes

M1ARSHALL v. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the Case.

sent to the bank for discount at the time the check was given
were never discounted, and were returned to the" sender.
They were not to be used for'the payment of the check unless
discounted.
An order to pay a particular sum out of a special fund cannot be treated as an equitable assignment pro tnto unless
accompanied with such a relinquishment of control over the
sum designated'that the fund-holder can safely pay it, and becompelled to do so, though forbidden by the drawer. A general deposit in'a bank is so much money to the depositor's
credit; it is a debt to him by the bank, payable on demand to
his order, not property capable of identification and specific
appropriation. A check upon the bank in the usual form, not
accepted or certified by its cashier to be good, does not constitute a.transfer of any money to the credit of the holder; it is
simply an order which may be countermanded, and payment
forbidden, by the drawer at any time before it is actually
cashed. It creates no lien on the money, which the holder
can enforce against th6 bank. It does not of itself operate as
an equitable assignment.
Judgment affirmed.
:MR. JusTicE MATrimws did not sit in this case or take any
part.in the decision.
