APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF PRIVATE LAND CLAIMS.
No. 28. Argued March 16, 189S. -Decided

May 31, 1898.

A valid grant was made in this case, which it was not within the power of
a temporary dictator to destroy by an arbitrary declaration.
This government discharges its full duty under the Gadsden treaty, when
it recognizes a grant as valid to the amount of the land paid for.

ON December 3, 1891, the appellant filed in the Court of

Private Land Claims his petition praying to have confirmed
to him a certain tract of land situate in the county of Cochise,
in the Territory of Arizona, known and designated as the
San Rafael del Valle grant. Subsequent proceedings resulted
in a trial and a decree in behalf of the government, dismissing the petition and adjudging petitiotier's claim and title
invalid. The title papers show that on March 12, 1827,
Rafael Elias made application to the treasurer general of the
state of Sonora for the purchase of "public lands adjacent to
the ranch of San Pedro, within the jurisdiction of Santa Cruz,
,as far as the place called Tres Alamos." On July I of that
year the treasurer general directed that proceedings be had
in accordance with law under the supervision of the a.calde
of Santa Cruz. The proceedings appear to have been regular.
The survey was of a tract reported by the surveyors to containi four sitios. The property was appraised at $60 a sitio, or
$240 altogether. The fiscal attorney approved the proceedings and advised that they "be continued to adjudication according to the foms and requisites in use." At the third
auction, on April 18, 1828, the property was struck off to
Don Rafael Elias, the petitioner, for the sum of $240. On
April 21, the petitioner paid this sum into the treasury.
Nothing further was done until April 29, 1833, at which time
the then treasurer general of the state of Sonora issued the
expediente, or title papers. This expediente opeas with this
preamble:

JusicE BREwER, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
This grant was made in the name of the state of Sonora
and by the proper officer of that state, if it had power t6_make
the grant. The first question, therefore, is as to the power
of the state. We held in United States v. Coe, 170 U. S. 681,
just decided, that from and after the adoption of the constitution of 1836 no such power was vested in the separate states.
But that case called for no determination of the authority those
states possessed prior thereto, and in respect to that matter no
opinion was expressed. We have in this case, and that immediately following, .Perrinv. United States, post, 292, elaborate
discussions by counsel as to the title to the public lands within
the limits of Mexico and the respective rights thereto of the
general government and the separate states. On the one hand
it is insisted that, a's in the case of the thirteen colonies that
formed the United States of America, the vacant lands were
the property of the states; that as no express cession was
made by any Mexican states to the general government the
title to those lands remained in the states until at least the
formation of the constitution of 1836, and that each state had
therefore the absolute right to dispose of all within its own
limits. On the other hand, it is said that, prior to the separation of Mexico from Spain, the lands were the property of the
king of Spain, that the separation created a new national gov.
ernment which succeeded to all the rights of the prior sovereign, including therein the ownership of all vacant lands. We

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

deem it unnecessary to review this discussion or'attempt to
settle the disputed question as to the location of the title. In
this expediente the treasurer general refers to "Article XI
of the sovereign decree number 70 of the general congress
of the union," as conceding to the states the revenues derived from the sale of lands within their resp.ective limits,
and upon that and law number 30 of the congress of the state
relies as the sources of, his power to make the conveyance.
The state having undoubtedly vested its authority in the
treasurer general, the inquiry comes back to the effect of said
Article XL
Preliminary thereto we must notice these matters:
The constitutive act of the Mexican federation, adopted
January 31, 1824, in Articles 5 and 6, declares:
"ART.5. The nation adopts for the form of its government
a popular representative and federal republic.
"ART. 6. Its integral parts are free, sovereign and independent states, in as far as regards exclusively its internal administration, according to the rules laid down in this act, and in
the general constitution.". 1 White's New Recopilacion, p. 375.
On October 4, 1824, a constitution was established. In it
Article 49 reads:
"The laws or decrees, which emanate from the general congress, shall have for their object:
"1. To sustain, the national independence, and to. provide,
for the preseivation and security of the nation in its exterior
relations.
"2. To preserve the federal union of the states, and peace
and public order in the interior of the confederation.
"3. To maintain the independence of the states among
themselves, so far as respects their government according to
the constitutive act and this constitution.
"4. To sustain the proportional equality of obligations and
rights which the states possess in point of law." 1 White,
p. 393.
And enumerating in Article 50 the powers possessed by the
general congress, subdivision 31 reads:'
"To dictate all laws and decrees, which may conduce to

CA-MOU v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

accomplish the objects spoken of in the forty-ninth article,
without intermeddling with the interior administration of the
states." 1 White, p. 395.
Article 137, defining the attributes of the supieme court,
names among others.:
"1. To take cognizance of disputes, which may arise between the different states of 'the union, whenever there arises
litigation in relation to the same, requiring a formal decree,
and that arising between a state and one or more of its inhabitants, or between individuals in relation to lands under concessions from different states, without prejudice to the right
of the parties to claim the concession from the party which
granted it." 1 White, 405.
It cannot of course be pretended that these provisions either
operated to transfer the title to vacant public lands from the
nation to the respective states or amount to a declaration that
the title to such lands is vested in the states. All that can
fairly be inferred from them is that the. supremacy of the
several states in matters of local interest was kecognized, and
further, that conflicting cessions of lands from different states
might be expected and that the settlement of disputes respecting them should be by the supreme court of the nation. These
inferences are by no means determinative of the question here
presented, and yet it must be conceded that they at least point
to some control by the states over vacant lands within their
limits, and suggest the exercise by those states of the right to
make concessions of those lands.
Two prominent laws of the Mexican nation are the colonization law of August 18, 1824, 1 White, 601; Reynolds, p.
121, and the law in respect to general and special revenues of
August 4, 1824. 'Reynolds, p. 118. White's translation of
Articles 1, 2, 3, 10, 11 and 16 of the colonization law, differing
slightly from that given by Reynolds, is as follows:
"ART. 1. The Mexican nation offers to foreigners, who
come to establish themselves within its territory, security
for their *persons and property; provided they subject themselves to the laws of the country.
"ART. 2. This law comprehends those lands of the nation,

OCTOBER TERI, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

not the property of individuals, corporations or towns, which
can be colonized.
"ART. 3. For this purpose the legislaturcs Of all the states
will, as soon as possible, form colonization laws or regulations
for their respective states, conforming themselves in all things
to the constitutional act, general constitution and the regulaI
tions established in this law."
"ART. 10. The military who, in virtue of *,he offer made
on the 27th of March, 1821, have a right to lands, shall be
attended to by the states, in conformity with the diplomas
which are issued to that effect by the supreme executive
power.
"ART. 11. If, in virtue of the decree alluded to in the last
article, and taking into view the probabilities of life, the- supreme executive power should deem it expedient to alienate
any portion of land in favor of any officer, whether civil or
military 9f the federation, it can do so from the vacant lands
of the territories."
"ART. 16. The government in conformity with the provisions established in this law will proceed to colonize the territories of the republic."
It is not pretended that the grant in question was made under
this colonization law, and we only ref6r to it as showing a recognition by the general government of some authority on the
part of the states in reference to the vacant lands. It will beseen that while Article 2 speaks of "the lands of the nation,"
Article 3 directs the states to enact colonization laws in conformity to the general provisions of the constitution. So that
the actual management of colonization affairs was put within
the conitrol of the states, subject, of course, to the superior
dominion of the general government. Article 10 provides
that military rights to lands, though created by the nation
shall be attended to by the states, thus implying at least that,
for convenience, administration of the vacant lands was entrusted to the states. Obviously the thought here was that
there should not be two places in which -the administration of
the public lands should be carried on, and so in Article 11 itwas provided that if in the judgment of the nation it was ex-

CAMOU v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

pedient to grant to a military or civil officer any public lands,
it was to be made from vacant lands in the territories. And,
finally, in Article 16, as though to separate the administration
of the public lands in the states from those in the territories,
it is distinctly declared that the national government will colonize the territories of the public. As heretofore said, all this,
of course, amounts only to assigning to the states the administration of the vacant lands for purposes of colonization.
The other act to which we have referred, the one which is
relied upon by the treasurer general as giving authority for
this expediente, is that in reference to general and special
revenues. It commences with the declaration that the following belong to the general revenues of the federation, and
then in ten articles are named revenues derived from different
sources, such as import and export duties, tobacco and powder,
etc. The eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh articles are as
follows, Reynolds, p. 118:
"8. That from the territories of the federation.
"9. National property, in which is included that of the
inquisition and temporal property of the clergy, or any other
rural or urban property that belongs, or shall hereafter belong,
to the publi6 exchequer.
"10. The buildings, offices, and the lands attached thereto,
which belong, or have belonged, to the general revenues and
those that -have been maintained by two or more of what
were formerly provinces, are at the disposal of the government
of the federation."11. The-revenues not included in the foregoing articles
belong to the states."
The eighth article gives to the national government all
the tevenues derived from the territories. Obviously the
entire management of the affairs of the territories was reserved to the general government, and any revenue derived
therefrom passed into the general treasury.
The ninth article is indefinite in that it fails to define
what is national property. It assumes that certain things
pass within the description of national property, and affirmatively includes within that description the property taken

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

from the clergy. The language used is broad enough to
include all public lands within the limits of the nation, and
yet if it was intended to include such lands it would seem
scarcely necessary to add the clause including those taken
from the clergy. Certain is it that according to our methods
of legislation, and our use of language, this article would not
be considered as defining the property the revenues from
which it assigns to the national government. The tenth
article seems to have little significance in this connection, and
refers obviously to public buildings and the grounds attached,
and not to vacant public lands. While the eleventh article
concedes to the states the revenue§ not included in the foregoing articles, it does not define those revenues, and depends
for its scope upon the significance and force of the prior
articles. If these articles were all that called for consideration it would be difficult to infer from them that the vacant
public lands were given to the states for purposes of sale or
for appropriation of the proceeds of such sales. But in the
same statute is a provision that "the sum of $3,136,875,
estimated as the deficit in the general expenses, shall be
apportioned among the states of the federation," and following that is the apportionment. Other sections required delivery by the states every month of their part of the above
apportionment and the final adjustment of the amount thereof
between the government and the states. Of course this
implies that within the limits of the state there were certain
matters of revenue reserved, out of which the states were to
collect the sums apportioned to them, and to return the same
to the general treasury. Subsequent legislation throws light
upon the meaning of this revenue law. Thus, on April 6,
1830, a decree was passed, the third article of which is as
follows:
," The go 'ernment shall have power to appoint one or more.
commissioners to visit the colonies of the frontier states, to
contract with their legislatures for the purchase, in the name
of the federation, of the lands they may consider suitable
and sufficient for the establishment of colonies of Mexican
and of other nations, to enter into such arrangements with

CAMOU v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

the colonies already established as they may deem proper for
the security of the republic, to see to the exact compliance
with the contracts upon the entry of new colonists, and to
examine as to how far those already etered into have been
complied with.
"4. The executive shall have the power to take the lands
he may considef suitable for fortifications and arsenals, and
for new colonies, and shall give the states credit for their
value on the accounts they owe the federation." Reynolds,
p. 148.
The language of this decree is very significant, and clearly
recognizes some title in the states, for why should commissioners be authorized'to contract with the legislatures of the
.states for the purchase .of lands which belonged to the
nation ? It also clearly recognizes the right of the states to
sell these vacant lands and apply the proceeds in settlement
of the demands made against them by the general apportionment of the revenue law of 1824. It declares that the
executive may take the lands he considers suitable for fortifications, arsenals and for new colonies, and at the same time
provides that he shall give the states credit on the amount
they owe the confederation. But why should any credit be
given if these lands so taken by the executive were the property of the nation and the states without authority to sell
them or receive the proceeds of sales ? If during all these
years thd lands were the property of the nation, were to be
held and sold only by the nation, and the proceeds thereof to
be accounted for directly to the nation, why should it be decreed that if the nation takes any part of them for arsenals
and other public purposes, credit for the value thereof is to
be entered upon the amounts due by the states to the nation ?
We find it difficult to escape the force of this decree of 1830.
It indicates that although the language of the revenue decree
of 1824 is indefinite, and does not in terms name vacant public lands, yet both the nation and the states understood that
its effect was to grant authority to the states to sell such
lands and appropriate the proceeds in settlement of the
amounts charged against them by the nation. We see no

OCTOBEI

Opinion of the Court.

other way in which to give reasonable force to the language
of this decree of 1830, and it must be held to be a national
interpretation of the revenue decree of 1824.
But we are not limited to this authoritative national exposition of the meaning of the revenue law of 1824. The testimony in the several cases of a similar nature now before us,
including therein the reports of the officers of this government sent to examine the archives of Mexico, discloses that
the state of Sonora, at least, assumed that the revenue act of
1824 authorized its disposal of the vacant public lands, and
acting on that assumption did in a multitude of cases make
sales thereof. In this connection it may be observed that the
constitution of the state .of Sonora, or State of the West,
declares, article 47, that the right of selling lands belongs
to the state. This constitution bears date May 11, 1825.
Law No. 30 of that state, of May 20, 1825, the law referred
to by the treasurer general in the expediente, recites that
"the congress has seen fit to decree the following provisional
law for the purchase of the lands of the state." Subsequent
legislation of the state is in the same line.
Further, sections 8 and 9 of article 161 of the national
constitution of 1824 made it the duty of each Mexican state "To present annually to each one of the houses of the
general congress a minute and comprehensive report of the
amounts that are received -and paid out at the treasuries
within their limits, together with- a statement of the origin
of the one and the other, and touching the different branches
of agriculture, commercial and manufacturing industries," etc.
And also -

"To forward to the two chambers (of the federal government) and when they are in recess, to the council of the
government, a certified copy of their constitutions, laws and
decrees."
It-may be assumed that these requirements of the national
constitution were complied with, and that the constitutions,
la.ws and decrees of the state and the proceedings had in
reference to these several sales of land were reported to the
congress of the nation. We find no act of that congress set-

CAMOU v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

ting asid.e"such legislation or sales. This is significant, and
it is not inappropriate to refer to Clinton v. En'glebrecht,
13 Wall. 434, 446, ini
which it was said:
"In the first place, we observe that the law has received
the implied sanction of congress. It was adopted in 1859.
It has been upon the statute book for more than twelve years.
It must have been transmitted to congress soon after it was
enacted, for it was the duty of the secretary of the territory to
transmit to that body copies of all laws, on or before the first
of the next December in each year. The simple disapproval by
congress at any time would have annulled it. It is no unreasonable inference, therefore, that it was approved by that body."
We are not insensible of the fact that the provisions of the
act of September 21, 1824, creating the office of commissary
general, an act which we had occasion to consider in .Ey's
Admini8trator v. United States, ante, 220, seem to make
against the idea of the administration of vacant lands by the
states, and it is difficult to work out from all the statutes
a consistent, continu6us and harmonious rule. We must in
each case endeavor to ascertain what the Mexican government recognized as valid, and when that is -done the duty
of respecting and enforcing the grant arises. Other matters
are referred to by counsel in their briefs, but it would needlessly prolong this opinion to refer to them. Our conclusion
is that at the time of these transactions the several states had
authority to make sales of -vacant public lands within their
limits, and that such sales, unless annulled by the national
government, must be considered as grants to be recognized
by this Government under the terms of the treaty of 1853.
We pass, therefore, to a consideration of the effect of the
decrees of Santa Anna. The lands in controvers were obtained from Mexico under what is kuown as the Gadsden
treaty of 1853. This treaty was concluded on December 30,
1853, and ratified June 30, 1854. At the time of the treaty
Santa Anna was supreme executive and virtually dictator in
Mexico, and the treaty was negotiated with him. On November 25, 1853, only about a month before the signing of the
Gadsden treaty, he published this decree:

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

"ART. 1. It is declared that the public lands, as the exclusive property of the nation, never could have been alienated
under any title by virtue of decrees, orders and enactments
of the legislatures, governments or local authorities of the
states and territories of the republic.
"2. Consequently, it is also declared that the sales, cessions or any other class of alienations of said public lands
that have been made without the express order and approval
of the general powers, in the manner prescribed by the laws,
are null and of no value-or effect.
. "3. The officials, authorities and employ~s upon whom
devolve the execution of this decree, shall proceed as soon as
they receive it to recover and take possession in the name of
the nation, of the lands comprehended in the provisions of
article 1, and that may be in the possession of corporations
or private individuals, whatever may be their prerogatives or
position.
"4. The judicial, civil or administrative authorities shall
admit no claims of any kind nor petitions whose purpose is to
obtain indemnification from the public treasury for the damages the unlawful holders or owners may allege under the
provisions of the preceding article; and they shall preserve
their right only against the persons from whom they have the
lands they are now compelled to return." Reynolds, p. 324.
On July 5, 1854, be published another decree, which was
even more specific, containing these provisions:
"ART. 1. The titles of all the alienations of public lands
made in the territory of the republic from September, 1821,
till date, whether by the general authorities or by those of the
extinguished states and departments, shall be submitted to
the revision of the supreme government, without which they
shall have no value and shall constitute no right of property.

"5.' The alienations of public lands, of whatever nature
they be, that have been made by the .authorities and officials'
of the departments without the knowledge and approval of
the general government, during- the epoch -when the central
system was in force. in the republic, are void.

CAMOU v. UNITEDSTATES.
Opinion of the Court.

"6. Those made by said authorities in the epoch of the
extinguished federation are likewise void ; provided they
were not made for the purpose of extending and promoting
colonization, which was the purpose proposed by the law of
August 18, 1824.
"7. Grants or sales of lands made to private individuals,
companies, 6r corporations under the express condition of colonizing them, a-d the holders of which have not complied
therewith in the terms stipulated, are declared to be of no
value." Reynolds, p. 326.
Subsequently, on December 3, 1855, and after Santa Anna
had been deposed'and while Juan Alvarez was president ad
interim, a decree containing the following provisions was
entered:
"ART. 1. The decrees of November 25, 1853, and July 7,
1854, which submitted to the revision and approval of the
supreme government the grants or alienations of public lands
made by the local governments of the states or departments
and territories of the republic from September, 1821, to that
date, are repealed in all their parts.
" ART. 2. Consequently, all the titles issued during that
period by the superior authorities of the states or territories
under ,the federal system, by virtue of their lawful faculties,
or by those of the departments or territories, under the central system, with express authorization or consent of the
supreme government for the acquisition of said lands, all in
conformity with the existing laws for the grant or alienation
respectively, shall for all time be good and valid, as well as
those of any other property lawfully acquired, and in no case
can they be subjected to new revision or ratification on the
part of the government." Reynolds, p. 329.
And again, on October 16, 1856, a decree was passed while
.gnacio Comonfort was prdsident,.the first article of which is
as follows:
"ART. 1. The decrees of November 25, 1853, and July 7,
1854, are void." Reynolds, p. 331.

nized Santa Anna in negotiating with and purchasing from
him the territory within the Gadsden purchase, the courts
must also recognize his declarations in respect to titles as
authoritative, citing in support of these general propositions
Wheaton's International Law, secs. 31 and 32, and Hallpck's
International Law, pages 47 and 62. Without questioning
the general propositions laid down in these authorities, we are
of opinion that too much weight was given to the decree of
Santa Anna of November 25, 1853, the only one announced
before the cession, and that that decree should not be considered as absolutely determinative of individual rights and
titles.
While it is true that practically Santa Anna occupied for
the time being the position of dictator, it must not be forgotten that Mexico, after its separation from Spain in 1821,
was assuming to act as a republic subject to express constitutional limitations. While temporary departures are disclosed
in her history; the dominant and continuous thought was of a
popular government under a constitution which defined rights,
duties and powers. In that aspect the spasmodic decrees
made by dictators in the occasional interruptions of constitutional government should not be given conclusive weight in
the determination of rights created during peaceful and rega
ular eras. The divestiture of titles once legally vested isjudicial act. In governments subject to ordinary constitutional limitations a mere executive declaration disturbs no
rights that have been vested, and simply presents in any
given case to the judicial department the inquiry whether
the rights claimed to have been vested were legally so vested.
Undoubtedly this Government dealing with Mexico, and find:
ing Santa Anna in control, rightfully dealt with him in a
political way in the negotiation of a treaty and the purchase
of territory, and the judicial department of this Government
must recognize the action of its executive and political department as controlling. But when the courts are called
upon to inquire as to personal rights existing in the ceded
territory, a mere declaration by the temporary executive cannot be deemed absolutely and finally controlling. It is un-

CAMOU v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

necessary to rest this case upon the fact 'lisclosed that these
decrees of Santa Anna were immediately thereafter revoked.
It is not significant that the substance of them was thereafter
reestablished. We are compelled to inquire whether prior to
such decree there were rights vested, rights which the Mexican
government recognized, and then d~termine whether those
rights were by such decree absolutely destroyed.
Turning to the decree of November 25, 1853, the first and
second articles are mere declarations of law. The third
article directs the officials to proceed to the execution of the
decree and to recover and take possession of the lands coming
within the scope of the prior articles. It does not appear that
any steps were taken by any officials to carry into execution
this decree. Whether this particular grant came within the
scope of the two declarations of law was a question to be considered and determined. On that question the grantee never
was heard. There never was a judicial adjudication that his
grant came within the scope of the first two articles. He was
never dispossessed. His property was never taken possession
of. It is going too far to hold that the mere declaration of a
rule of law made by a temporary dictator, never enforced as
against an individual. grantee in possession of lands, is to be
regarded as operative and determinative of the latter's rights.
As for the reasons heretofore mentioned, we are of opinion
that a valid grant was made in this case, we think this arbitrary declaration by a temporary dictator was not potent to
destroy the title. The decree of the Court of Private Land
Claims must therefore be reversed. As shown by the statement of facts the survey of the land claimed in ihe petition is
in excess of the four sitios granted and paid for. While the
excess is not so great as in many cases, yet we think the rule
laid down in Ely's Administrator v. United States, ante, 220,
should control, and that this Government discharges its full
duty under the treaty when it recognizes a grant as valid to
the amount of land paid for.
Te decree of the Court of Private Land Claims will be re
versed, and the case remandedforfurtherproceedings.
