It may be that the end lines need not be parallel under the
act of 1866; may converge or diverge, and' may even do so as
to new veins, of which, however, we express no opinion, but
they must be straight -no other define planes which can be
continuous in their own direction within the meaning of the
statute. It may be that there was liberty of surface form under
that act, but the law strictly confined the right on the vein
below the surface. There is liberty of surface form under the
act of 1872. It was exercised in Iron Silver Mining Co. v. Elgin

NEW ORLEANS v. TEXAS AND PAOIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY.
APPEAL

FROM

THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR

THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.
No. !.

Argued January 8, 4, 1898. -Decided

May 31, 1898.

Where an undertaking on one side is in terms a condition to the stipulation
on the other, that is, where the contract provides. for the performance
of some act, or the happening of some event, and the obligations of the
contract are made tO depend on such performance or happening, the
conditions are conditions precedent; but when the act of Qne is not necessary to the act of the other, and the loss and inconvenience can be
compensated in damages, performance of the one is not a condition
precedent to the performance of the other.
It being shown by the record that the railway terminus from which the extension along Claiborne street was -to be madb was never constructed;
and that the crossing from Westwego to the land in front of the park
was also never established, bot, on the contrary, that the company extended its road down the river to Gouldsboro, where it made its main
crossing, the right to the extenion and the right to the use of the batture no longer obtains.
The suspensive condition, by which the rights of the company under the
original ordinance were held in abeyance, operates also upon the lease,
and the mere payment of rent did not change the nature of the suspensive condition, or work an estoppel.

Statement of the Case.
The ends of justice will be best subserved by -not passing upon the third assignment of error, but the rights of both parties in relation thereto may
be left open for further consideration in the court below.

THE, New Orleans Pacific Railway Company became duly
incorporated under the general laws of the State of Louisiana
on June 29, 1875. By Article I, of its charter, it was given
corporate existence for the term twenty-five years from that
date. By Article III it was empowered among other things:
"To lay, construct, lease, own, and use a railroad with one or
more tracks and suitable turntables upon such course or route
as may be deemed by a majority of the directors of said company most expedient, beginning at a point on the Mississippi
River at New Orleans, or between New Orleans and the
parish of Iberville, on the right bank of the Mississippi, and
Baton Rouge on the left bank, or from New Orleans or Berwick's Bay via Vermilionville, in the parish of Lafayette, and
Opelousas, in the parish of St. Landry, or from any of said
points, or from any point within the limits of this State, and
running thence toward and to the city of Shreveport, or the
city of Marshall or Dallas, in the State of Texas, in such direction and route or routes as said company shall fix, and with
such connecting branches in the State of Louisiana as may be
deemed proper; to locate, construct, lease, own, maintain and
use such branch railroads and tracks as the majority of the
directors of said company may from time to time deem
proper and expedient and for the interest of said company to
own and to use, and lease, with the right to connect their
main line with any other line or lines in other States, which
shall authbrize the exercise of said privilege within their
limits; to establish and maintain in the city of New Orleans
proper freight and passenger depots, and to connect them by
tracks and ferries with the left bank of the Mississippi River,
at such point or points as may be deemed most convenient
for the public interest, and to use in such ferries, steamboats
and other vessels, and for the purposes of such depots, tracks
and ferries to acquire property by expropriation; to acquire,
construct, maintain and use suitable wharves, piers, warehouses, yards, steamboats, harbors, depots, stations and other

works and appurtenances connected with and incidental to
said railway and its connections, and to run and manage the
same as the directors of the said company may deem to be
most expedient and to the welfare of -said corporation; to
construct and maintain its said railroads, or any part of the
same, and to have the right of way therefor across or along
or upon any waters, water courses, river, lake, bay, inlet,
street, highway, turnpike or canal within the State of Louisiana which the course of said railways may intersect, touch or
cross, provided that said company shall preserve any water
course, street, highway, turnpike or canal which its railways
may so pass upon, along or intersect, touch or cross, so as not
to impair its usefulness to the public unnecessarily; to obtain by grant or otherwise. from any parish, city or village
within the State any rights, privileges or franchises that any
of said parishes, cities or villages may choose to grant i4
reference to the construction, maintenance, management and
use of the railroads of said company, its depots, cars, locomotives and its business within the limits of such or any of. said
parishes, cities and- villages; to purchase or lease from. any
railroad, company or corporation, at any authorized sale, any
-railroad and the charter, franchises, property and appurtenances thereof and to maintain and use the same as a part of
the property of said company."
On February 19, 1876, the General Assembly of the State
of. Louisiana passed Act No. 14 of 1876, to confirm said charter of the railway company, with amendments thereto, which
among other things declared: "That the term of existence
of the said New Orleans Pacific Railway Company shall be
so extended that said company by its name and under the
aforesaid mentioned articles of incorporation, shall have perpetual succession and' that Shreveport in Louisiana shall be
the northwestern terminus of said New Orleans Pacific Railway Company, and that the main line shall be completed to
Shreveport before any branches shall be constructed."
The City Council of New Orleans on November 9, 1880,
adopted Ordinance No. 6695, entitled "An ordinance grantiig to the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company or its

The New Orleans Pacific Railway Company, on June 20,
1881, entered into a written agreement with the Texas and
Pacific Railway Company, a corporation organizbd under the
laws of the United States, by the terms whereof the New
Orleans Pacific Railway Company consolidated itself with
the Texas and Pacific Railway Company on the terms and
conditions specified in the agreement, "by granting, bargaining, selling," etc., "unto the Texas and Pacific Railway Company all the franchises, corporate rights or privileges of the
New Orleans Pacific Railway Company, together with its
track, roadbed, buildings, rolling stbck, engineer's tools, bonds,
stocks, grants, privileges, property (real and personal) and
every right, title and interest in and to any franchises or
property, real or personal, and all rights of every name and
kind in which the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company
had any right, privilege or interest, situated and being in the
State of Louisiana or in the State of Texas, or elsewhere, it
being declared by the agreement that the object of the agreement was to so merge the rights, powers and privileges of the
New Orleans Pacific Railway Company into the Texas and
Pacific Railway Company that the Texas and Pacific Railway
Company, under its own chartered name and organization
should, without impairing any existing right, exercise in addition thereto, all the powers, rights, privileges and franchises
and own and control all the properties that the New'Orleans
Pacific Railway Company then exercised and owned, or by
its charter and, by-laws it had the right to exercise, own or
control."
Thereafter, on July 11, 1882, the City Council adopted
Ordinance No. 7946, as follows:
" An ordinance supplementary to Ordinances 6695, 6732 and
6938, Administration Series, granting certain rights to- the
New Orleans Pacific Railway Company and its assigns, and
providing for the selection of a site for the Claiborne market.

Statement of the Case.
"Whereas, by section 2, of Ordinance 6695, Administration
Series, a right was given to the New Orleans Pacific Railway
Company, or its assigns, to locate, construct and maintain an
extension of its railroad through Claiborne street, with a
right to construct a passenger depot on the neutral ground of
Claiborne street, at or near the intersection of Claiborne
street with Canal street, with a proviso that should it become
necessary for the building of the depot or laying tracks to
remove the Claiborne market, then the New Orleans Pacific
Railway Company, or its assigns, should rebuild the same at
their own expense on such lots as the city shall designate;
and
"Whereas, by Ordinances NTos. 6732 and 6938, Administration Series, certain rights have also been granted to said company and its assigns with reference to the said Claiborne street
and to Thalia street, and the company has built its road from
Baton Rouge to New Orleans, crossing Thalia street, and established its terminus in the city limits at Thalia street and the
levee, and is preparing also to cross from Westwego to the
City Park, and thence to Claiborne street; now, therefore,
"SECTIox 1. Be it ordained by the Council of the City of
New Orleans, That the Administrator of Improvements, the
Administrator of Commerce, and the Administrator of Waterworks and Public Buildings, be, and they are hereby, authorized and directed, within sixty days from the passage of this
ordinance, to select such lots as may be needful and proper
for a new site for said market; and when such selection shall
have been made they shall deposit a proces-verbal thereof in
the office of the Administrator of Waterworks and Public
Buildings.
"SEc. 2. Be it further ordained, That whenever said company or its assigns shall find it necessary to remove said building it shall be rebuilt on said lots so selected and as prescribed
in said original ordinance.
"S~c. 3. Be it further ordained, That in crossing the new
.canal under its charter, and according to the said .ordinances,
the said railway company, or its assigns, shall do so by means
of a proper drawbridge."

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statement of the Casb.

The company also sent its officers with certain city officers
in the summer of 1882 to inspect lots thought suitable at that
time for the Claiborne market, when the removal of the
market might be decided upon; and stated by its officers that
the lots would be purchased, the market taken down and
another market put up, but that if this was not satisfactory to
the city, the city should remain silent for a while, because if
it were known the railroad wanted the lots, too much would
be asked for them. In the summer of 1883, the company.demanded from the city surveyor lines and levels for a track on
the river front from Louisiana avenue to Jackson street, and
the city surveyor not furnishing them, instituted suit June 11,
1883, in the civil district court for the Parish of Orleans, where
the same is still pending, to compel the city surveyor by writ
of mandamus to furnish such lines and levels. The company
also paid $1000 rent for the two years ending March 8, 1882,
and 1883, under an alleged lease of the batture in front of the
Upper Oity Park and made a tender of $500 for rent under
said alleged lease for the year ending March, 18841; and acquired by private ownership four squares of ground adjoining
the Upper City Park; two squares fronting the river and two
in the rear thereof.
The record showed that the railroad company did not
establish its terminus in the rear of the city of New Orleans
at the place designated by Ordinance 6695 of November 9,
1880, and referred to in Ordinance 6732 of December 3, 1880;
that the company did not as stated or required in Ordinance

did not build its road from the batture along the edge of the
park through the designated streets to the point in the rear
*of the city where the proposed terminus was to be located,

disclosed that instead of making Westwego its terminus on

the west bank of the river, the railroad was prolonged nine
miles further down the bank of the river to a point designated
as Gouldsboro; and this latter point being approximately
opposite the foot of Thalia street on the east bank of the
river, wharves and inclines were constructed at Gouldsboro,
whence the traffic of the road was carried across the river to
the foot of Thalia street in the City of New Orleans, where
depots and structures have been established by the company.
On the 15th of April, 1884, the City Council adopted an
ordinance, No. 685, Council Series, as follows:
"An ordinance repealing certain sections of the Ordinance
No. 6938, A. S., granting privileges to the New Orleans
Pacific Railway Company.
"Be it ordained, That sec. two (2) of the Ordinance No.

Pacific Railway Company a lease of the Upper City Park

revoked."
June 16, 1886, the City Council adopted an ordinance, No.

July 2, 1886, the receivers of the Texas and Pacific Railway
Company, and the Fidelity Insurance Trust and Safe Deposit
Company, filed a bill of complaint in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana, which
alleged the incorporation of the Texas and Pacific Railway
Company under certain acts of Congress, the acquisition by
the Texas and Pacific Railway Company of all the property
and franchises of the New Orleans and Pacific Railway Company, the appointment of receivers of the Texas and Pacific
Railway Company, the adoption by the city of New Orleans

The city of New Orleans filed its answer, November 1, 1886,
which admitted the incorporation of the Texas and Pacific
Railway Company; the incorporation of the New Orleans
Pacific Railway Company; the contract entered into between
the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company and the Texas and
Pacific Railway Company, averring, however, the-effect of said
contract to be that the Texas and Pacific Railway Company
was held and bound to all the obligations imposed upon the
New Orleans Pacific Railway Company, and was affected by
all the equities existing between the New Orleans Pacific
Railway Company and the city of New Orleans; the appointment of the receivers; the adoption of Ordinance No. 6695, on
the 9th of November, 1880; Ordinance No. 6732, on December
3, 1880; Ordinance No. 6938, on March 29, 1881; the failure
on the part of complainants to comply with the obligations
imposed by said ordinances; the nullity of the lease of the
batture in front of the Upper City Park, purported to be

of the right to build a depot on the neutral ground of Claiborne
street, said batture in front of said park and said neutral
ground.being dedicated to public use; and the legality of the
repealing Ordinances 685 and 1828, Council Series.
On the 3d of February, 1887, complainants filed a supplemental bill, which alleged that under the ordinance set forth

Pacific Railway Company, its transfers and incline between
Thalia and Terpsichore streets, at New Orleans, had been duly
constructed and used for about five years, and in like manner
and during the same time the tracks of said railway, connecting its transfer facilities and its depots and sheds at its Thalia
street terminus, had been laid and used in Pilie and Water
streets, and along the river front from Thalia street up to
about Race street; that it had become necessary for the business of said railway to lay a small spur track to connect said
wharf above the transfer slip with the said tracks on Pilie and
Water streets; that the complainants had applied to the city
surveyor for lines and levels of said spur track; that the city
surveyor refused to grant said lines and levels under a certain
resolution of the council of September 15, 1885, prohibiting
him from giving any lines for such work in the street without
submitting the question to the council; that said resolution
was illegal and a breach of complainants' contract, and that
interference by the mayor of the city with complainants'
building said spur track was apprehended.
Upon these allegations a writ of injunction was prayed for,
restraining the city from interfering with complainants in the
work of building said spur track to connect the wharf above
the transfer incline between Thalia and Terpsichore streets
with the tracks of the railway between Thalia .and Water
streets, along the river front, and in the work of strengthening and filling up said wharf and driving piling to reach the
same with said spur, and for a decree as prayed for in their
original bill.
Upon this supplemental bill a restraining order was granted
which, by agreement, was to stand as an injunction pending suit.

Opinon of the Court.

MRM. CHIEF JUSTICE FuLLER, after stating the case, delivered
the opinion of the court.
The assignments of error relate to three subjects: First,
the bztture or space in front of the City Park, embraced in
the lease made by the city to the railroad company in execution of tfe terms-of the city ordinance; second, the construction of a track on Claiborne and .Canal, and the building on
Claiborne near Canal of a passenger depot; and, lastly, the
wharfage rights claimed by the railroad company at the foot
of Thalia street in virtue of section 4 of Ordinance No. 6938.
The argument as to the first and second assignments is,
that the right granted to the railroad company by Ordinances
6695, 6732 and 6938, to extend its track from the point designated as its terminus, in the rear of the city along Claiborne
to Canal, and there to build a passenger depot, as also the
lease, which, to carry out the ordinance, empowered the railroad company to use the batture in front of the park, and
to construct its railroad along the edge thereof through certain designated streets to the rear of the city, were all granted
to the railroad company as accessory rights, depending for
their existence upon the crossing at Westwego and the location by the railroad company of its terminus in the rear of
the city. In other words, that these rightswere given to the
railroad company, subject to conditions precedent, or to use
the language of the law. of Louisiana, subject to suspensive
conditions. It is further contended: First, that in consequence of the failure of the railroad company to cross at
Westwego and to locate its terminus as aforesaid, and its
election, on the contrary, to continue its .road down the river
to Gouldsbo-eo and there cross the river, it never acquired the
right to enjoy the privileges above mentioned, and hence that
the repealing ordinances are valid. Second, that even if the
rights in favor of the company above mentioned were not
granted to it on a suspensive condition, they were clearly
subject to a resolutory or dissolving condition, arising from the
obligation to cross at Westwego and to'locate the terminus
in the rear of the city at the point designated in the. original

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

ordinance, the contention being that the failure to do so
within the period named in the ordinance authorized the city
to treat the contract as dissolved and pass the repealing
ordinances in question. The railroad -company meets these
propositions by denying that crossing at Westwego and the
location of the terminus in the rear of the city, at the point
named in the original ordinance, was made a con.ition suspending the operation of the grant of the rights above stated,
and argues that even if it be conceded that the location of the
terminus at the point originally pointed out created a condition, it was riot a suspensive but a resolutory one. Although
it is admittbd that the happening of a resolutory condition
dissolves the contract, yet such consequences, it is asserted,
do not arise from the mere happening of the condition, and
cannot be availed of by one of the contracting parties of his
own will, since before the resolutory condition can be invoked
it must be established by a suit brought that such condition
has arisen and that the effect of its existence has been to
dissolve the contract. That is, the claim is that under the
law of Louisiana a dissolving or resolutory condition does not
operate upon the .contract proprio vigore, but requires the
judgment or decree of a court to give it effect, and that before
finding a contract dissolved in consequence of a resolutory
condition, the court has the power to obviate the effect of
the condition by giving further time to perform the act from
which the condition is claimed to have arisen, if, in its judgment, the equities of the case so require.
The question which first aris.es is, was the right of the
railroad company to the property in front of the paric and to
the track on Claiborne street, including the construction of a
passenger depot on Claiborne near Catial, subject to suspensive
conditions. The Louisiana Civil Code provides as follo vs:
"ART. 2021. Conditional obligations are such as are made
to depend on an uncertain event. If-the obligation is not to
take effect until the event happen, it is a suspensive condi-.
tion; if the obligation takes effect immediately, but is liable
to be defeated when the event' happens, it is then a rsolutory
condition.

NEW ORLEANS v. TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY.

333

Opinion of the Court.

2022. Conditions, whether suspensive or resolutory,
are either casual, potestative or mixed."
"AnT. 2024. The potestative condition is that which makes
the execution of the agreement depend on an event which it
is in the power of the one or the other of the contracting
parties to bring about or to hinder."
In defining the suspensive condition the Louisiana Code says:
"ART. 2043. The obligation contracted on a suspensive
condition, is that which depends, either on a future and
uncertain event, or on an event which has actually taken
place, without its being yet known to the parties."
These provisions of the Louisiana Code are like those of the
Code Napoleon on the same subject. Articles 1168, 1170,
1181.
In Cornell v. Hope Insurance Company, 3 Martin, N. S.
223, 226, the Supreme Court of Louisiana said, in respect of
conditions precedent:
"They are recognized and provided for by our system of
jurisprudence, and by every other that has in view the ordinary transactions of men. The obligation is conditional,
when it depends on a future or uncertain event, says our
Code. The event then must be shown to make the obligation
binding on the party against whom it is presented. For until
it takes place, he is not bound to perform what he has promised. C. Code, 2MT2, Art. 68. There is an exception to this
rule in regard to the dissolving condition. But 'in relation
to all others it is true, and it is a matter of no moment
whether we say the obligation is suspended until the condition
is performed -or that the performance of the condition must
precede the execution of the obligation. C. Code, 274, Art.
81 and 3, Toullier, Droit Civil Francaise, liv. 3, tit. 3, chap. 4,
No. 472; Pothier, Trait6 des Ob., No. 202."
"The effect of a suspensive condition, as its name necessarily implies, is to suspend the obligation until the condition
is accomplished or considered as accomplished; till then nothing is due; there is only an expectation that what is undertaken will be due; vendente conditione nondum debetur sed
8,ve8 e8t debitum iri." (Pothier, Trait6 des'Ob., 218.)
"ART.

OCTOBER TER],

1897.

Opinion of the Court.

The suspensive condition under the Louisiana Code is the
equivalent of the condition precedent at common law.
The general principles in respect of conditions precedent
are set -forth sufficiently for the purposes of this case by Chief
Justice Shaw in kill Dam Foundry v. lovey, 21 Pick. 440,
cited-by appellant. Where the undertaking on one side is in
terms a condition to the stipulation on the other, that is,
where the contract provides for the performance of some act,
or the happening of some event, and the obligations of the
contract are made to depend on such performance or happening, the conditions are conditions precedent. The reason and
sense of the contemplated transaction, as it must have been
understood by the parties and is to be collected from the
whole- contract, determine whether this is so or not; or it
may be determined from the nature of the acts to be done and
the order inwhich they must necessarily predede, and followeach other in the progress of performance. But when the act
of one is not necessary to the act of the other, though it
Would be cofivenient, useful or beneficial, vet, as the want of
-it does' not prevent performance,. and the loss and inconvenience can be compensated in damages, performance of the
one is not a condition 'precedent to performance by the other.
.The non-performance on one side must go to the entire substance of the contract and to the'whole consideration, so that
it may safely be inferred as the intent and just construction
of the contract that if the act to be.performed on the. one side
is not done, there is no consideration for the stipulations on
the other side. See Cutter v. Powell, 2 Smith's Leading
Cases, 17, and notes.
In examini~ng the contract embodied in the ordinances it i§
essential. to have in mind the particular territory to which the
ordinances relate, and we, therefore, insert on page 335 an out"line sketch extracted from a map of the city of. New Orleans
contained in the record.
The original Ordinance 6695 contemplated that the proposed railroad would be built upon the west bank of the
Mississippi.River, New Orleans b6ing upon the east bank, and
that the road would cross that' river to the east bank some

335

Opinion of the Court.

hundred or more miles above New Orleans, coming to that
city on the east bank,-and entering in the rear of the city,
that is, in that portion of the city lying a considerable distance back from the river. The purpose of the ordinance was

clearly indicated by its title, which declared that it was intended to grant "to the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company or its assigns the right to establish its terminus within
the city limits and to construct, maintain and operate a railroad

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

to and from such a terminus, with one extension for passenger
purposes and another for freight purposes, into and through
certain streets and places in the city of New Orleans." The
.preamble to the ordinance recited the desire of the railroad
to enter the city at about a certain point, and to construct its
terminus between the New Canal and Melpomene street, providing the city would grant the right to extend its tracks
"from suck terminus into and through Claiborne street to
Canal street for passenger purposes; and shall also grant the
right to extend its.tracks from suck terminus north of Claiborne Canal by the most convenient and practicable route
through the public streets to the river front for freight purposes." The first section of the ordinance grants the railroad
the right to enter the city to the point stated in the preamble,
and to construct and maintain at the terminus necessary depots, shops, yards, warehouses and other structures, convenient and useful for the transaction of its business. The
point at which the right.to construct this terminus was given
by the ordinance is embraced within the triangular space in
the rear of the city as marked on the sketch above given.
The second section of the ordinance empowered the company
to "locate, construct nd maintain an extension of its railroad
with all necessary tracks, switches, turnouts, sidings and
structures of every kind, convenient and useful and appurinto and through Claiborne
tenant to said railroad, .
street to Canal street, with the right to construct a passenger
depot at or near tie intersection of Claiborne street with
Canal street." A glance at the sketch will make clear the
fact that Claiborne street thus designated was in the rear of
the city, quite near the point where the railroad had contracted to establish its terminus, depots and structures, and
that the route thus mapped out in the very nature of things
and in the language of the ordindnce was a mere right
granted to the railroad to extend its tracks from the terminus,'
which the railroad was under the obligation to build, to and
along the designated route to the ppint indicated on Claiborne
and Canal. The third section of the ordinance obligated the
city to designate a street from the point where the terminus

NEW ORLEANS v. TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY.

337

Opinion of the Court.

was selected, and where the company was to establish itself,
through which it could build an extension for the purposes of
its freight business to the river front. On the face of this
ordinance it isapparent that the rights thus given the railroad
to extend along Claiborne to Canal for passenger purposes,
and along a street to be designated to the river for freight
purposes, were mere accessories to the obligation imposed by
the ordinance upon the railroad to build its depots, structures,
warehouses, etc., at the point indicated, and that the incidental
rights of extension from the terminus to the other points
could have no existence, if no terminus was established from
which the extensions could be made. Reading the provisions
of the ordinance with the preamble and the title, it cannot
reasonably be controverted that the rights of extension were
granted upon the suspensive condition that the railroad should
terminate at the point indicated, and there build the shops
and depots from which the right to extend its tracks was con-*
ceded. And this is, if possible, made more certain by considering the fourth section, which, in' express words, provides
that the privileges of extefision granted were dependent upon
the establishment of the terminus at the point indicated, and
would cease to exist if, after the establishment of the terminus, the railroad company should abandon it. The language of the fourth section is as follows:
"That the right of way, franchises and privileges herein
granted to the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company are
granted only on condition and in consideration that the said
grantees shall permanently establish., the terminus of said road
within the city limits, and maintain said terminus during the
existence of the charter of said company, for which period
said right of way and privileges shall last; and' should the
said company at any time hereafter abandon its said road, on
the east side of the Mississippi River and its terminus within
the city limits, then this grant shall cease and terminate, and
be without force or effect from the date of such abandonand it is still made a condition of this grant
ment; . .
that said railway company shall complete its road from the
crossing of the Miss.issippi River, at or near Baton Rouge, to
voL cLxx-22

338

Opinion of the Court.

its terminus in this city within two years from the promulga.
tion of this ordinance."
The words "the terminus of said road" and "said termi'
nus" used in this fourth section, clearly refer to the terminus
fixed by the ordinance, and where the railroad agreed to
establish its shops, roundhouses, etc. It follows, then, that
the ordinance granted a right to the railroad company to
enter the city to reach a designated point, and imposed upon
the company the -obligation to erebt its depots, shops, warehouses, etc., at that point; that in consideration of this obligation assumed by the company, to be performed within two
years, a right was given to it to extend from the depot so
designated a passenger track to a given point, and a freight
track to another point; that the two rights of extension were
the mere resultants of the principal obligation imposed upon
the company, in consideration of which the rights to the extensions were conceded; and that the ordinance, in addition,
inorder to remove all question that the incidental rights of
extension were dependent upon the priiicipal obligation to
establish a terminus at the point named, provided that, even
after the fixed terminus was established, if it were abandoned, the company shiould cease to enjoy the right of extenston along Claiborne to Canal which the original ordinance
granted. Thus there were plainly created, first, a suspensive,
and, after the work was done, a resolutory condition.
Nor is there anything in Ordinance 6732, adopted on
December 3, 1880, which changed the rights of the parties.
That ordinance reiterated and reasserted the nature of the
privilege -covered by the concession made by the previous
ordinance, and designated Thalia street, which is marked on
the sketch, as the one through whish the railroad company
should build the track for freight purposes in compliance with
the obligations assumed by it under the first ordinance.
This brings us to the consideration of the ordinance numbered 6938, passed in March, 1881. The purpose of that
ordinance, and the change in condition which rendered its
adoption necessary, is stated with great clearness in the preamble thereof :

NEW ORLEANS v. TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY.

339

Opinion of the Court.

"Whereas, the New Orleans Pacific Railway. Company has
purchased-the road heretofore constructed under the charter
of the New Orleans, Mobile and Texas Railway Company on
the west bank of the Mississippi River, beyond Bayou Goula
and Westwego, and with a view to maintaining and operating
the said road in connection with and as a part of its through
line to and from its terminus in New Orleans, designated in
section 1 of Ordinance No. 6695, Administration Series, passed
on the 9th day of November, 1880; such line to cross the
Mississippi River from a point at or near Westwego'to a point
on the east bank of the river in front of the Upper City Park,
late Foucher property; thence to extend -by the best and most
practicable route to the designated terminus between the New
Canal, Claiborne canal and Carrollton avenue:
"Now, therefore, for the purpose of securing to the city of
New Orleans, the advantages that will result from locating
and permanently maintaining the terminus of the New Orleans Pacific Railway within the limits of the city of New
Orleans, as herein above recited."
The ordinance then proceeds in section one to authorize
the railroad to maintain wharves, inclines, etc., on the river
front at the Upper City Park from such point on the river
front "as its crossings" from Westwego shall be located at,
and from this point to build a track along the western border
of said City Park, and from thence by the best and most
practicable route to "its designad terrinus east of Carrollton avenue." The second section grants to the railroad land
in front of the City Park belonging to the city, on the borders of the river, for the purpose of establishing the. crossing
of the road as recited in the first section. The third section
gives the company the right, to lay certain tracks down the
river front, in other words, to connect the newly authorized
tracks' with those existing at or- near Thalia street. The
fourth section granted the company the right to make certain
structures at the foot of Thalia street, the point to which the
extended freight track referred to in the previous ordinances
was to terminate, and at which, as we shall hereafter .see, the
company actually made its crossing from the west bank, and

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

where it now maintains its terminal facilities. The rights
covered by this section are those to which. the third assignment of error relates and are not involved in the inquiry now
being.pursued. The fifth section authorized the mayor of the
city to enter into a contract of lease with the railroad for
the piece of ground in front of the City Park referred to in
the ordinance, and.the sixth section declared that the grant
referred to was made upon the-condition of the establishment
of "its terminus within the city limits."
Referring to the sketch, and considering the record and the
terms of this ordinance, the situation was this: The railroad
company having obtained a concession from the city of a
right to enter the city on the east bank in a particular direction and to build its terminus at a point. designated, and having received authority, ifit did the foregoing things, to make
certain extensions, found it necessary, in consequence of its
change of route, to obtain a further consent from the city.
The change of line was this: Instead of building its road on
the west bank to a point one hundred or more miles above
New Orleans, and there crossing the river and"coming thence
into the city in therear thereof, 4s designated in the original
ordinance, the company having bought a road on thb west
bank, the terminus of which was Westwego, about opposfte
the City Park, asked and was allowed that it be exempted
from reaching its design.ted terminus by.entering the city in
the rear thereof, and that it be granted the right to establish
a crossing from Westwego to the land in front of the City
Park, so that from the land thus conceded the railroad might
reach the point where it had contracted that it would make
its permanent establishment. The argument that this ordinance gave the railroad the power to establish a new or different terminus from that referred to in the original ordinance,
because the Place where the terminus was to be is referred to
indefinitely in the ordinance as between the New Canal, Claiborne canal and Carrollton avenue, is untenable. Indeed the
ordinance'contains not a word relieving the railroad from the
obligation to establish and maintain the terminus indicated in
the previous ordinances. On the contrary, the preamble de-

NEW ORLEANS v. TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY.

311

Opinion of the Court.

clares that the new route was granted to the railroad to
enable it to reach "the designated terminus between the
Claiborne canal and Carrollton avenue," which is ±he situation originally described. It further recites that it is passed
for.the purpose of enabling the railroad to locate and permanently maintain "the terminus . . . within the- limits of
the city of New Orleans, as hereinabove recited."
In stating the purpose of the grant of the new right of way
from the point' of landing at the City Park opposite Westwego
along the line of the park over the route indicated, the first'
section in the ordinance declares it to be given to afford the
railroad the""most practicable route to its designated terminus
east of Carrollton avenue." True it is that in section six, in
referring to the previous obligations of the company to establish its terminus, the words used are that the grantee shall
permanently establish 'its terminus within the city limits."
But, manifestly, the words "its terminus" as used there refer
to its terminus as defined not only in the ordinance in question
but in the prior ordinances by which the grant was made.
It being shown by the record that the terminus from which
the extension along Claiborne street to Canal was to be made
was never constructed, and that the crossing from Westwego
to the laud in front of -the park was also never established,
but, on the contrary, that the company extended its road down
the river to Gouldsboro where it made its main crossing, it
needs no reasoning to demonstrate that the right to the extension down Claiborne street and the right to the' use of the
batture in front of the City Park no longer obtains. The
claim of the corporation really amounts to this: That, having
had certain accessory rights conferred upon it in the event it
discharged particular obligations, it can disregard the obligations, escape the burdens resulting therefrom, and yet hold on
to all the rights which depended for their existence upon the
performance of the obligations which the company has disregarded. The ordinances cannot be properly construed as

railroad, under the terms' of the ordinances, the land in front
of the City Park, when such use was accorded to the railroad
solely to enable it to accomplish a purpose which it has 'declined to effectuate by car.rying its main crossing to another
and a far distant point. In re.aching these conclusions we are
not unmindful of the argument predicated on the supposed
effect of ordinance numbhered 7946 A. S. The title of this
ordinance indicates its purpose. It is as follows:
"An ordinance supplementary to ordinances 6695, 6732 and
6938, Administration Series, granting certain rights to the New
Orleans Pacific Railway Company and its assigns, and providing for the selection of a site for the Qlaiborne market."
. The preamble of this ordinance recites the two ordinances
conferring the right to build the extension on Claiborne
street and states this right to be one of maintaining "an extension of its -railroad through Claiborne street," and. after
reciting the fact that the railroad had crossed at Thalia street,
and established its terminus there, declares that the railroad
is preparing also to cross from Westwego to the City Park,
and thence to Claiborne street. The ordinance then proceeds
to provide for arrangements for removing the market from
Claiborne street in order to allow the extension on that street
to be built. The argument which is based upon this ordinance
is this, that, as at the time this ordinance was passed, the railroad .had crossed from Gouldsboro to Tlhalia street and estab-.
lished its terminus there, as is recited in the ordinance, hence
it is asserted the ordinance recognizes the fact that the railroad
was entitled to the extension on Claiborne street despite the
fact that it had not established its terminus as required by the
ordinances from which the right to the extension on Olaiborne street arose. But this overlooks the fact that in the
very sentence upon which reliance is placed reference is made
to the-ordinance giving the corporation the right to build from
the City Park to the "designated" terminus. One portion of
the sentence cannot be separated from the other. " The most
that can be said of the argument advanced, from the text of
this ordinance, is that it-seeks by implication and remote deduction to absolve the company from the obligation imposed

upon it when the accessory right of extension down Claiborne
street was granted, and thus to enable the company to retain
the incidental right, when it had relieved itself of the obligation upon which the right rested. It is not tQ be doubted that
the rule is that contracts are not to be so violently construed
as to destroy rights in consequence of suspensive conditions,
but it is also equally obvious that they are not to be so interpreted as to relieve one of the'parties to a contract from the'
obligations resulting therefrom and thereby destroy the suspensive condition plaihly written therein. Corporations do
not take public grants and privileges by implication, and
where express and positive obligations are imposed in making
a grant, these obligations cannot without violating an elementary canon of interpretation be frittered away in consequence
of loose implications made by way of reference in subsequent
municipal ordinances. The formal contract of lease executed
by the city of the batture in front of the City Park took its origin
from and was sanctioned by the ordinance granting the 'right
to cross the river from Westwego to the land covered by the
lease in order to enable the corporation to carry its tracks
from thence to the terminus which it contracted to establish
under the original ordinance. It follows, therefore, that the
suspensive condition by which the rights of the company
under the original ordinance were held in abeyance operates
also uppn the lease in question.
The mere payment of rent did not change the nature of the
suspensive condition or work an estoppel. The right to use
the property was limited to the destination stated- in the contract. (La. Civil Code, 2711.) But this right to use was covered by the suspensive condition, and the contract of lease
only evidenced the agreement to use the property for the purposes stated, when the suspensive condition ceased to operate
by the discharge of the obligations on which it rested, that is,
the establishment of the terminus at Westwego, the crossing
therefrom, and the location of the shops, etc., at the place fixed
in the original ordinance. The case is aptly illustrated by

pensive condition was entered into, but the prospective buyer
was allowed to take possession pending the condition. The
claim was that this fact destroyed the suspensive nature of the
condition. But the court held to the contrary, considering
that the fact of possession was subject to the suspensive condition, as it was upon such condition that the contract had
been entered into. Laurent, vol. 17, No. 33, p. 53.
Concluding that the rights on Claiborne street and to the
batture in front of the park were subject to suspensive conditions, it is manifest from the facts which we have stated that
the railroad company .was not entitled to possess or enjoy the
same. This renders it unnecessary to consider the resolutory
condition and leaves only for consideration the subject-matter
of the third assignment of errors. This'asserts that the rights
conveyed by the fourth section of Ordinance No. 6938 to
wharfage, etc., at Thalia street are not validly held by the
corporation. This is based not on the claim of a condition
either suspensive or resolutory, but because it is asserted that
the grant was ultravires. The repealing ordinances, however,
do not embrace this grant, and except for the argument at
bar it does not appear that the city has repudiated the grant.
Since this case was argued a suggestion has been made that
this grant has been, in effect, ratified by a provision of a new
constitution said to have been recently adopted by the State
of Louisiana. As we must reverse the decree rendered for the
reasons above stated, we deem that the ends of justice will
best be subserved by not passing on. this assignment, thus
leaving the rights of both parties in relation thereto open for
further consideration in the court below.
