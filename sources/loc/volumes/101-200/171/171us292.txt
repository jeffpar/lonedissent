.Mr.
Special Assistant .Matthew G. Reynolds for appellees.
Mr.Solicitor General was on his brief.
MR. JUSTICE BREWER

delivered the opinion of the court.

So far as the question of title is concerned this case is similar
to the one immediately preceding, Camou v. United States,
ante, 277. For reasons therein stated the decree of the Court
of Private Land Claims will be reversed and the case remanded
for further proceedings. It is true, as suggested in its opinion,
the Court of Private Land Claims thought that there was no
sufficient location of the tract in controversy, and that probably the grant was void for uncertainty in the description of
the property. It may be that this conclusion was right. At
the same time, in view of what has been r.ecently said by this
court in. respect to boundaries, description and area, we think
that justice requiires that we reverse the judgment and remand
the case for further proceedings. Perhaps the claimants may
be able to satisfactorily identify a tract not larger than the
area purchased and paid for which should equitably be recognized as the tract granted.
Reversed
