BLAKE V. UNITED STATES.
1. The President has the power to supersede or remove an officer of the army
or the navy by the appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate, of his successor.
2. It was not the purpose of the fifth section of the act of July 13, 1866, c. 176
(12 Stat. 92), to withdraw that power.
APPEAL

from the Court of Claims.

This suit was instituted in the Court of Claims, by Blake, to
recover the amount claimed to be due him, by way of salary as
a post-chaplain in the army, from April 28, 1869, to May 14,
1878.
The court below found that, under date of Dec. 24, 1868,
Blake, a post-chaplain in the army, stationed at Camp MeDowell, Arizona, addressed to the Secretary of War a communication, in which he complained of unjust treatment to which,
during several years, he had been subjected by various officers.
He asked for the fullest and most thorough investigation of the
facts, and concluded: "But if this cannot be done, then I wish
to tender to the Honorable the Secretary of War my resignation as a chaplain of the army, and to lay the facts, which I
have for years been accumulating with the greatest care, before
the church and the country at large." After this letter came
to the hands of the post commandant, his attention was called
to the mental condition of Blake, and it was suggested that the
latter was not responsible for his act in writing the letter. It
was, therefore, retained until Dec. 31, 1868, when it was forwarded by the commandant with an indorsement recommending the acceptance of the resignation, and saying, among other
things, that "the tenor of this and other communications forwarded will, no doubt, convince the department commander of
his utter uselessness in the position he holds."
The letter of Dec. 24, 1868, was forwarded through the district and department headquarters, and, finally, through the
headquarters of the military division of the Pacific, to the
Secretary of War, by whom it was transmitted to the President, who accepted the resignation, to take effect March 17,
1869. Each of the commanding officers through whose office

STATES.

[Sup. Ct

the letter passed recommended the acceptance of the resignation.
On March 28, 1869, Blake telegraphed to the delegate in
Congress from Arizona, stating that he did not intend to resign, and that if his letter was construed as a resignation, to
withdraw it immediately. When the Secretary of War was
informed of the telegram, he stated that the resignation had
been accepted and was beyond recall.
Blake, having received official notice of such acceptance, addressed the following letter to the Secretary of War: "NAPA CITY, CAL., April 27, 1869.

"Hon. JOHN A. RAwLis,
"Secretary of War, Washington, -D. 6:
my great surprise I was yesterday informed,
"DEAR Sm, -To
thro' H'd Q'rs Dep't of California, that my ' resignation' as postchaplain, U. S. Army, 'had been accepted by the President,' 'to
take effect larch 17, 1869.'
"As I am not aware of having at any time resigned my commission, and as I am now in a state of feeble health, caused by efficient
services in the line of duty in 1863, 1864, and since, I beg that the
favorable reconsideration of the President may be given to my case,
and that I may be ordered before a retiring board for examination,
and to duty if fit for it.
"Justice to the service, no less than to myself and family, after
eight years of devoted labors, will not permit me to be silent in
view of the wrongs done me at Camp McDowell, A. T., and I am
confident that you will not allow me to suffer wrongfully.

"CHARLES M. BLixE,
" (Late)Post Chaplain, U:. S. A."
This letter was referred to the adjutant-general, who returned it with this indorsement: "Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War, with the paper
on which the resignation of Chaplain Blake was accepted. Chaplain Blake appears not to be of sane mind.
"E. D. TowNsEND, Adjt.- GenL."
On July 7, 1870, the President nominated to the Senate six
persons to be post-chaplains in the army, to rank from July 2,

BLAKE V. UNITED STATES.

1870; among them was that of "Alexander Gilmore, of New
Jersey, vie Blake, resigned." Gilmore's nomination was confirmed July 12, 1870, and on the 14th of that month he was
commissioned as post-chaplain, to rank as such from July 2,
1870. He has since regularly received his salary and performed
his duties as such post-chaplain.
The court further found, that for some time prior to, and
on, Dec. 24, 1868, Blake had been suffering from physical disease and mental prostration; that in the light of subsequent
events "there can be no doubt he was then insane;" that he
was, at times, irritable and incoherent, manifesting egotism
and suspicion of his superiors; that not until after the above
date were these symptoms developed to such an extent as necessarily to induce persons who came in contact with him to
believe he was mentally incapable of acting with sound reasoning purpose; also that, at the date of the telegram to the delegate from Arizona, he was "totally unqualified for business,"
and at the date of the letter of April 27, 1869, "he was not of
sound mind."
It also found that the insanity of Blake continued until about
the year 1874.
On Sept. 28, 1878, the President made the following order:
"EXECUTIVE MhixSio, Sept. 28, 1878.
"It appearing from the evidence, and from the reports of the
surgeon-general of the army and the superintendent of the government hospital for the insane, that Chaplain Blake was insane at the
time he tendered his resignation, it is held that said resignation was
and is void, and the acceptance thereof is set aside. Chaplain
Blake will be ordered to duty, and paid from the date of the resignation of post-chaplain Preston Nash, to wit, May 14, 1878, by
which resignation a vacancy was created, which has not been filled.
The claim of Chaplain Blake for pay from the date of his resignation to May 14, 1878, during which his successor held the office,
discharged its duties, and received pay, is not decided, but is left
t*r the decision of the court, where it is understood to be now
pending.

"1. It appearing from the evidence presented, and from the reports of the surgeon-general of the army, and the superintendent
of the government hospital for the insane, that Post-Chaplain
Charles M. Blake, U. S. Army, was insane at the time he tendered
his resignation, December 24, 1868, said resignation is, by direction
of the President, declared void, and the acceptance of the same in
letter from this office, dated March 17, 1869, as announced in Special
Orders No. 62, March 17, 1869, from this office, is set aside.
"Chaplain Blake is restored to the list of post-chaplains of the
army with his original date of rank, and with pay from May 14,
1878, since which date a vacancy in that grade has existed. He
will report in person to the commanding officer, department of Arizona, for assignment to duty.

The court below dismissed the petition, whereupon Blake
appealed to this court.
"ir. George H. Williams and Mr. Ralph P. Lowe, for the appellant.
Mr. Attorney-GeneralDevens, contra.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.

The claim of Blake is placed upon the ground that before, at
the date of, and after the letter addressed to the Secretary of
War, which was treated as his resignation, he was insane in a
sense that rendered him irresponsible for his acts, and consequently that his supposed resignation was inoperative and did
not have the effect to vacate his office. Did the appointment
of Gilmore, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
to the post-chaplaincy held by Blake, operate, proprio vigore,
to discharge the latter from the service, and invest the former
with the rights and privileges belonging to that office? If this
question be answered in the affirmative, it will not be necessary
to inquire whether Blake was, at the date of the letter of Dec.
24, 18C8, in such condition of mind as to enable him to per.

form, in a legal sense, the act of resigning his office; or, whether
the acceptance of his resignation, followed by the appointment
of his successor, by the President, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, is not, in view of the relations of the
several departments of the government to each other, conclusive, in this collateral proceeding, as to the fact of a valid effectual resignation.
From the organization of the government, under the present
Constitution, to the commencement of the recent war for the
suppression of the rebellion, the power of the President, in the
absence of statutory regulations, to dismiss from the service an
officer of the army or navy, was not questioned in any adjudged
case, or by any department of the government.
Upon the general question of the right to remove from office,
as incident to the power to appoint, Bx parte Hennan (13 Pet.
259) is instructive. That case involved the authority of a district judge of the United States to remove a clerk and appoint
some one in his place.
The court,*among other things, said: "All offices, the tenure of which is not fixed by the Constitution or limited by
law, must be held either during good behavior, or (which is
the same thing in contemplation of law) during the life of the
incumbent, or must be held at the will and discretion of some
department of the government, and subject to removal at
pleasure.
"It cannot for a moment be admitted that it was the intention of the Constitution that those offices which are denominated inferior offices should be held during life. And if
removable at pleasure, by whom is such removal to be made?
In the absence of all constitutional provision or statutory regulation, it would seem to be a sound and necessary rule to
consider the power of removal as incident to the power of appointment. This power of removal from office was a subject
much disputed, and upon which a great diversity of opinion
was entertained in the early history of this government. This
related, however, to the power of the President to remove
officers appointed with the concurrence of the Senate; and the
great question was whethei the removal was to be by the Pres.
ident alone, or with the concurrence of the Senate, both consti-

tuting the appointing power. No one denied the power of the
President and Senate jointly to remove, where the tenure of
the office was not fixed by the Constitution; which was a full
recognition of the principle that the power of removal was
incident to the power of appointment. But it was very early
adopted, as the practical construction of the Constitution, that
this power was vested in the President alone. And such
would appear to have been the legislative construction of the
Constitution." 1 Kent, Com. 309; 2 Story, Const. (4th ed.),
sects. 1537-1.540, and notes; 2 Marshall, Life of Washington,
162; Sergeant, Const. Law, 372; Rawle, Const., c. 14.
During the administration of President Tyler, the question
was propounded by the Secretary of the Navy to AttorneyGeneral Legare, whether the President could strike an officer
from the rolls, -without a trial by a court-martial, after a decision in that officer's favor by a court of inquiry ordered for the
investigation of his conduct. His response was: "Whatever
I might have thought of the power of removal from office, if
the subject were res integra, it is now too late to ditpute the
settled construction of 1789. It is according to that construction, from the very nature of executive power, absolute in the
President, subject only to his responsibility to the country
(his constituents) for a breach of such a vast and solemn trust.
3 Story, Com. Const. 397, sect. 1538. It is obvious that if
necessity is a sufficient ground for such a concession in regard
to officers in the civil service, the argument applies a multo
fortiori to the military and naval departments. . . . I have
no doubt, therefore, that the President had the constitutional
power to do what he did, and that the officer in question is
not in the service of the United States." The same views
were expressed by subsequent attorneys-general. 4 Opin. 1;
6 id. 4; 8 id. 233; 12 id. 424; 15 id. 421.
In Du Barry's Case (4 id. 612) Attorney-General Clifford
said that the attempt to limit the exercise of the power of
removal to the executive officers in the civil service found no
support in the language of the Constitution nor in any judicial
decision; and that there was no foundation in the Conctitution
for any fistinction in this regard between civil and military
efficers.

Oct. 1880.]

BLAKE V. UNITED STATES.

In Lanshg', Case (6 id. 4) the question arose as to the
power of the President, in his discretion, to remove a military
storekeeper. Attorney-General Cushing said: " Conceding,
however, that military storekeepers are officers, or, at least,
quasi officers, of the army, it does not follow that they are not
subject to be deprived of their commission at the will of the
President.
" I am not aware of any ground of distinction in this respect, so far as regards the strict question of law, between
officers of the army and any other officers of the government.
As a general rule, with the exception of judicial officers only,
they all hold their commissions by the same tenure in this
respect. Reasons of a special nature may be deemed to exist
why the rule should not be applied to military in the same
way as it is to civil officers, but the legal applicability to both
classes of officers is, it is conceived, the settled construction of
the Constitution. It is no answer to this doctrine to say that
officers of the army are subject to be deprived of their commissions by the decision of a court-martial. So are civil officers by impeachment. The difference between the two cases
is in the form and mode of trial, not in the principle, which
leaves unimpaired in both cases alike the whole constitutional
power of the President.
" It seems unnecessary in this case to recapitulate in detail
the elements of constitutional construction and historical induction by which this doctrine has been established as the
public law of the United States. I observe only that, so far
as regards the question of abstract power, I know of nothing
essential in the grounds of legal conclusion, which have been
so thoroughly explored at different times in respect of civil
officers, which does not apply to officers of the army."
The same officer, subsequently, when required to consider this
question, said that " the power has been exercised in many cases
with approbation, express or implied, of the Senate, and without challenge by any legislative act of Congress. And it is expressly reserved in every commission of the officers, both of the
navy and army." 8 Opin. 231.
Such was the established practice in the Executive Department, and such the recognized power of the President up to the

BLAKE V. UNITED

STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

passage of the act of July 17, 1862, c. 200 (12 Stat. 596),
entitled "An Act to define the pay and emoluments of certain
officers of the army, and for other purposes," the seventeenth
section of which provides that "the President of the United
States be, and hereby is, authorized and requested to dismiss
and discharge from the military service, either in the army,
navy, marine corps, or volunteer force, any officer for any cause
which, in his judgment, either renders such officer unsuitable
for, or whose dismission would promote, the public service."
In reference to that act Attorney-General Devens (15 Opin.
421) said, with much reason, that so far as it "gives authority
to the President, it is simply declaratory of the long-established
law. It is probable that the force of the act is to be found in
the word ' requested,' by which it was intended to re-enforce
strongly this power in the hands of the President at a great
crisis of the State."
The act of March 8, 1865, c. 79 (18 Stat. 489), provides
that, in case any officer of the military or naval service, thereafter dismissed by the authority of the President, shall make
application" in writing for a trial, setting forth, under oath,
that he has been wrongfully and unjustly dismissed, "the President shall, as soon as the necessities of the service may permit, convene a court-martial to try such officer on the charges
on which he was dismissed. And if such court-martial shall
not award dismissal or death as the punishment of such officer,
the order of dismissal shall be void. And if the court-martial
aforesaid shall not be convened for the trial of such officer
within six months from the presentation of his application for
trial, the sentence of dismissal shall be void."
Thus, so far as legislative enactments are concerned, stood
the law in reference to dismissals, of army or naval officers, by
the President, until the passage of the army appropriation act
of July 17, 1866, c. 176 (14 Stat. 92), the fifth section of
which is as follows:"That section seventeen of an act, entitled ' An Act to define the
pay and emoluments of certain officers of the army,' approved July
seventeenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, and a resolution, entitled ' A Resolution to authorize the President to assign the 0,nnmand -0troops in the same field, or department, to officers of the

same grade, without regard to seniority,' approved April fourth,
eighteen hundred and sixty-two, be, and the same are, hereby rep'eatled. And no officer in the military or naval service shall, in
time of peace, be dismissed from the service, except upon and in
pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial to that effect, or
in commutation thereof."
Two constructions may be placed upon the last clause of that
ection without doing violence to the words used. Giving them
a literal interpretation, it may be construed to mean, that although the tenure of army and naval officers is not fixed by the
('onstitution, they shall not, in time of peace, be dismissed from
the service, under any circumstances, or for any cause, or by
any authority whatever, except in pursuance of the sentence of
a court-martial to that effect, or in commutation thereof. Or,
in view of the connection in which the clause appears, - following, as it does, one in the same section repealing provisions
touching the dismissal of officers by the President, alone, and
to assignments, by him, of the command of troops, without
regard to seniority of officers,- it may be held to mean, that,
whereas, under the act of July 17, 1862, as well as before its
passage, the President, alone, was authorized to dismiss an army
or naval officer from the service for any cause which, in his
judgment, either rendered such officer unsuitable for, or whose
dismissal would promote, the public service, he alone shall not,
thereafter, in time of peace, exercise such power of dismissal,
except in pursuance of a court-martial sentence to that effect,
or in commutation thereof. Although this question is not free
from difficulty, we are of opinion that the latter is the true construction of the act. That section originated in the Senate as
an amendment of the army appropriation bill which had previously passed the House of Representatives. Cong. Globe, 39th
Congress, pp. 3254, 3405, 3575, and 3589. It is supposed to
have been suggested by the serious differences existing, or
which were apprehended, between the legislative and executive
branahes of the government in reference to the enforcement, in
the States lately in rebellion, of the reconstruction acts of Congress. Most, if not all, of the senior officers of the army enjoyed, as we may know from the public history of that period,
the confidence of the political organization then controlling the

BLAKE V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct,

legislative branch of the government. It was believed that,
within the limits of the authority conferred by statute, they
would carry out the policy of Congress, as indicated in the reconstruction acts, and suppress all attempts to treat them as
unconstitutional and void, or to overthrow them by force.
Hence, by way of preparation for the conflict then apprehended
between the executive and legislative departments as to the
enforcement of those acts, Congress, by the fifth section of the
act of July 18, 1866, repealed not only the seventeenth section
of the act of July 17, 1862, but also the resolution of April 4,
1862, which authorized the President, whenever military operations required the presence of two or more officers of the same
grade, in the same field or department, to assign the command
without regard to seniority of rank. In furtherance, as we suppose, of the objects of that legislation, was the second section of
the army appropriation act of March 2, 1867, c. 170 (14 Stat.
486), establishing the headquarters of the general of the army
at Washington, requiring all orders and instructions relating to
military operations issued by the President or Secretary of
War to be issued through that officer, and, in case of his inability, through the next in rank, and declaring that the general
of the army "shall not be removed, suspended, or relieved from
command, or assigned to duty elsewhere than at said headquarters, except at his own request, without the previous approval of the Senate, and any orders or instructions relating to
military operations issued contrary to the requirements of this
section shall be null and void; and any officer who shall issue
orders or instructions contrary to the provisions of this section
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor in office," &c.
Our conclusion is that there was no purpose, by the fifth section of the act of July 13, 1866, to withdraw from the President the power, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to
supersede an officer in the military or naval service by the
appointment of some one in his place. If the power of the
President and Senate, in this regard, could be constitutionally
subjected to restrictions by statute (as to which we express im
Dpinion), it is sufficient for the present case to say that Con,gress did not intend by that section to impose them. It is. in
substalee and effect, nothing more than a declaration, that Ihe

power theretofore exercised by the President, without the concurrence of the Senate, of summarily dismissing or discharging
officers of the army or the navy, whenever in his judgment the
interest of the service required it to be done, shall not exist, or
be exercised, in tiwe of peace, except in pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial, or in commutation thereof. There
was, as we think, no intention to deny or restrict the power of
the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to displace them by the appointment of others in their
places.
It results that the appointment of Gilmore, with the advice
and consent of the Senate, to the office held by Blake, operated
in law to supersede the latter, who thereby, in virtue of the
new appointment, ceased to be an officer in the army from and
after, at least, the date at which that appointment took effect,
and this, without reference to Blake's mental capacity to
understand what was a resignation. He was, consequently, not
entitled to pay as post-chaplain after July 2, 1870, from which
date his successor took rank. Having ceased to be an officer
in the army, he could not again become a post-chaplain, except
upon a new appointment, by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate.
1imrnmack v. United States, 97 U. S. 426.
As to that portion of the claim covering the period between
April 28, 1869, and July 2, 1870, it is only necessary to say
that, even were it conceded that the appellant did not cease to
be an officer in the army by reason of the acceptance of his
resignation, tendered when he was mentally incapable of understanding the nature and effect of such an act, he cannot
recover in this action. His claim for salary during the above
period accrued more than six years, and the disability of insanity ceased more than three years before the commencement of
this action. The government pleads the Statute of Limitations, a-d it must be sustained. Congress alone can give him
the relief which he seeks.
J"udment affirmed.
