CHICAGo v. TILLEY.
A party to a contract, who has performed part of it according to its terms, and
is prevented from completing it by the failure of the other party, is entitled
to compensation for the work performed.
ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern District of Illinois.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Mr. William C. Goudy, for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. Melville TV. Fuller,contra.
MR. JUSTICE WOODS delivered the opinion of the court.

On Aug. 28, 1872, the City of Chicago entered into a contract
with the County of Cook, of which it was the county seat, for
the joint occupancy of block No. 39, in the city, known as the
court-house square, whereby, among other things, it was agreed
as follows: -

"The said parties shall join in the erection of a public building
on said block 39, for the use of the county and city governments
respectively, and the courts of record of said county.
"The general exterior design of said building shall be of a uniform character and appearance, as may hereafter be agreed upon by
the board of county commissioners and the common council of the
city of Chicago.
"That portion of said building situate west of the north and
south centre line of said block shall be erected by the city of
Chicago at its own expense."
In June, 1875, the county, being ready to proceed with its
portion of the building, appointed James J. Egan as its architect, who entered upon the preparation of plans and the construction of the foundation for the county's portion of the
building.
On Aug. 9, 1875, the city council passed an ordinance which
repealed all former ordinances, orders, and resolutions of the
council, pertaining to the erection and construction of the city's
portion of the new city hall and court-house, and rescinded all
former action in relation to the appointment of architects, and

CHICAGO V. TILLEY.

expressly provided that "nothing in this ordinance shall be
construed as to in any manner affect, or in any wise rescind,
impair, or amend any contract or other agreement now subsisting between the city of Chicago and the county of Cook."
On the same day the council passed an order, the material
portion of which is as follows :"Ordered, that one architect shall be appointed, whose duty it
shall be to prepare the necessary plans and specifications for the
erection of the city's portion of a new city hall and court-house,
upon block 39, in the original town of Chicago, commonly known
as the court-house square, and the general exterior design of the
same to be of a uniform character and appearance, as shall be agreed
upon by said architect and board of public works and said county
commissioners, said architect, when the plans and specifications
shall have been prepared by him, and agreed upon by said board,
to take charge of and superintend the construction of said building
to its completion under the direction and control of said board of
public works, and said architect shall also do and perform every
other service or thing necessary to be done, in and about the construction and erection of the city's portion of said building to completion, which shall be required to be done and performed by him
as such architect, by said board of public works, and said architect
shall receive from the city of Chicago as his fhll compensation for
his entire services as such architect the sum of $37,500, said sum
being three per cent of the sum of $1,250,000, which shall be the
entire cost of the city's portion of said building; and such compensation shall be in full for all services of such architect, and no other
or further compensation whatever shall be paid to him by said
city."
The order further provided that, whenever the plans and
specifications should be agreed upon in manner aforesaid, the
board of public works should proceed with the city's portion of
said building.
After the passage of this order the city council proceeded to
elect an architect to act under its provisions, and Tilley the
defendant in error was chosen.
On August 24 lie was officially notified of his election, and on
the same day made known to the officers of the city his acceptante of the office, and offered to enter into a written contract

and give bonds; but they were not deemed necessary by the
city authorities, and were dispensed with.
Soon after the acceptance of employment by him as architect, under the order of August 9, he proceeded to prepare plans
for the city's portion of the building.
He made plans for the several floors or stories of the buildings, consulted with the heads of the various departments of
the city government as to the accommodations their departments would respectively need, and from the information thus
obtained made interior plans for the proposed building, and he
also prepared designs and plans for the exterior of the building; these plans or designs were exhibited to the members of
the board of public works and to the city officers, from time to
time, during the months of September, October, and a part of
November, 1875.
The board of public works proceeded to advertise for bids
for excavations for the foundations, and the plaintiff prepared
the plans and specifications for such excavations, and also prepared plans and specifications for the foundations and subbasement of the proposed building.
Early in November it was ascertained that the plans prepared by Tilley did not harmonize with the plans which had
been prepared by Egan, the architect of the county, and pursuant to a resolution of the common council, passed November
15, a joint meeting of the mayor, the city board of public
works, the building committee of the common council, the
president of the board of county commissioners, and the building committee of the county board, was held to consult in
regard to some feasible plan by which the difference arising
between the city and county architects might be satisfactorily
settled. This joint meeting was held, and was attended not
only by the city and county officials mentioned, but also by the
plaintiff as architect of the city, and Egan as architect for the
county. They had their respective plans there, and explained
them to the officials in attendance. The result of this meeting
for consultation and examination of plans was a direction by
the joint meeting to the architects to prepare a joint compromise plan for the exterior of the building.
The joint meeting adjourned to a future day, for the purpose

Oct. 1880.]

COICAO

v. TILnYr.

of giving the architects time to prepare their new plan or
plans. On the day to which the adjournment was taken the
joint meeting reassembled, and Egan presented sketches of a
compromise plan, embodying substantially the features upon
which the building is now being constructed; but Tilley
presented no plan, and did not concur in or indorse Egan's
plan.
After an examination and discussion of Egan's compromise
plan, the proof tends to show that it was adopted by the joint
meeting, and the county authorities proceeded to act upon that
plan as the one which had been agreed upon and settled by
them and the city authorities. After the last joint meeting
the proof tends to show that Tilley proceeded to prepare
"compromise plans," which, after a time, he exhibited in
the ante-room of the council-chamber, and also to members of
the board of public works at the office of the board.
On Jan. 13, 1876, at a special meeting of the council called
for the purpose of considering matters pertaining to the city
hall and court-house, a resolution was passed by the council
which, in effect, directed the board of public works to adopt
Tilley's compromise plans.
After this meeting of the common council he proceeded to
complete his compromise plans, including floor plans for each
story, specifications for foundations and sub-basements, and
plans for exterior elevation, so that early in the spring of 1876
his plans were so far advanced that he could have proceeded
with the construction of the building, and could have had the
tracings and working drawings ready as soon as needed for
the progress of the work. He was ready at all times to proceed with the construction of the building, but was not allowed
to do so.
In the fall of 1876 and spring of 1877, when the city council
determined to proceed with the construction of the building,
he offered his services as architect, but they were refused; that
is to say, he offered to proceed and perform his part of the contract by supervising the erection of the building when the city
was ready to proceed with its construction.
On Aug. 27, 1878, he brought this suit. He declared ol

The City of Chicago pleaded the general issue.
The evidence introduced on the trial of the cause tended to
establish the facts above recited.
Thereupon the court, among other things, charged the jury
as follows: "There is no provision in the contract, or in any subsequent
dealings or relations between the parties, that shows how this
sum of 837,500, the compensation that Tilley was to receive
for his services, was to be paid, but I think the fair presumption is, inasmuch as it was expected that the erection of this
work would extend to a long term of years, perhaps, that the
plaintiff was not to wait until the entire completion of the
work before he received some compensation, and that he was
to be paid from time to time upon some basis to be established, so that when the work was done he should not have
received more than the aggregate amount of his compensation.
"Tilley was employed like any other employd of the city, to
do a certain thing. It was, as far as practicable, to contribute
his professional skill, and the suggestion of plans which might
or might not be adopted.
"It may then be considered as undisputed that Tilley was
employed to prepare plans and specifications, and did some

work in the line of his employment, and for this he is entitled
to compensation, as far as possible, at the rate for which he
was to do the whole work under the contract; that is to say,
he had agreed to prepare plans and specifications and superintend the entire construction of the building for $37,500. He
did a part of that work. He did something in the line of his
duty; and if it is possible to ascertain from the proof and contract how much his compensation should be for the work, in
the ratio of the entire compensation, the jury should arrive at
that."
The City of Chicago excepted to these charges. There were
other charges excepted to, but these present all the questions
which are raised by the assignments of error.
The jury returned a verdict for Tilley for $13,000, on which
the court rendered judgment. This writ of error was brought
by the city to reverse that judgment.
The assignments of error all refer substantially to the construction put by the court upon the contract between the
plaintiff in error and the defendant in error. If the contract
was rightly construed by the court, then all its charges to the
jury were correct and the plaintiff in error has no ground of
complaint.
The question at what time the defendant in error was to
receive his compensation had become entirely immaterial. If
be was entitled to recover at all, he could, at the time the suit
was brought, lawfully claim all the compensation that was
owing to him. The point which the plaintiff in error makes
is that he was entitled to nothing. Its argument is that the
contract was an entire one, and that he was entitled to no
compensation until he had fully completed and performed it;
and not having done this, was entitled to nothing.
The evidence submitted to the jury tended to show, and the
jury must have found, that the defendant in error, when the
city council decided in the fall of 1876 to go on with the construction of the building, offered to proceed and perform his
part of the contract, and that his services were refused.
The question is thus raised whether, up to that time, he had
done what the contract required him to do. It is clear from
the record that he never did procure the concurrence of the

CHICAGO

[Sup. 0t.

board of county commissioners in his designs for the exterior
of the building.
The city claimed that his contract was not only to prepare
the necessary plans and specifications for the erection of the
city's portion of the new city hall, but to obtain the approval
and adoption of his plans by the board of county commissioners. In our opinion this was not the meaning of the contract.
The agreement between the city and county for the erection
of a building for their joint use, whose general exterior design
should be of uniform character and appearance, one half to be
built by the city, at its own expense, and the other by the
county, was still in force. The county had previously appointed
its own architect. The contract between the city and the defendant in error was not based on the idea that there was to
be but one design prepared, and that by him, which was to be
satisfactory both to the city and county, but that both architects were to devise plans, and there was to be a general conference and a selection of one or the other of these plans, or
the adoption of some compromise plan.
The city could not reasonably expect any architect to give
his time and labor in devising plans for a building on the condition that he was to receive no compensation unless he procured the assent to his plans of another body of fifteen persons,
which had employed its own architect to devise plans for the
same building. No prudent man would agree to such a con
tract.
It seems reasonably clear from the contract itself, and the
circumstances under which it was made, that the city took
the risk of securing the agreement of the county to some plan.
It was indispensable that there should be some concurrence of
views between the authorities of the city and county touching
the external appearance of the building. The antecedent contract between the city and the county required this. It was
clear that sooner or later the authorities of the city and county
would concur in some common plan. The contract between
the city and the defendant in error was for his services to aid
in devising a plan to which the county might be induced to
accede. The county at the same time had its own architect at

Oct. 1880.]

CHICAGO V. TILLEY.

159

work devising a plan for the same building. The city and
county would thus have two designs from which to make their
choice, and, if neither were acceptable, have two architects to
devise a compromise plan.
The preparation of a design for the exterior of the building
was but a small part of the work which the defendant in error
contracted to do. He was required to prepare plans and speci.
fications for excavations for the foundations, and for the foundations themselves, and for the sub-basement; to prepare plans
and specifications for the interior of the building, to divide it
into the apartments necessary to accommodate the business of
the city; to lay off the corridors, halls, staircases; to devise all
the interior conveniences and decorations of a large and costly
building; to select and specify the materials of every description that were to be used; to decide upon and make drawings
for the structure of the inside walls, the floor, the roof; to
make designs for the wood-work; and to provide for plastering,
plumbing, and painting. All these matters were to be settled
by him, and minute and detailed specifications were to be prepared for the entire work; so that contractors might be able to
bid intelligently.
The work which the defendant in error undertook to do, in
preparing the necessary plans and specifications for the building, was a vast one, requiring much time and great labor and
skill on his part, and the aid of draftsmen, clerks, and other
assistants. To construe his contract to mean that he was to
do all this work and receive no compensation for it unless he
could induce the board of county commissioners to agree to his
plan for the exterior design, and reject that of their own architect, is to give it a meaning which in our judgment neither of
the parties to it ever contemplated. It is no reply to this to
say that he might have prepared his designs for the exterior of
the building and secured the concurrence of the county board
therein before proceeding with the residue of the work. There
is nothing in the contract which indicates that the defendant
in error was expected to do this. If such had been the purpose
of the parties, it would have been easy to express it. On the
contrary, by the very terms of the contract, it was as much the
duty of the city board of public works as of the defendant in

CHICAGO

[Sup. Ct.

error to procure the approval by the county board of the exte.
rior design prepared by him.
The fact is apparent that the contingency of a disagreement
between the city and county authorities in regard to the exterior plan of the building was not anticipated, and no provision
was made for it. The thing to be done by the defendant in
error was "to prepare the necessary plans and specifications
for the erection of the new city hall and court-house," and to
superintend the erection of the building when the exterior design had been agreed upon by himself, the board of public
works of the city, and the county commissioners.
The proceedings of the city council show that this was the
construction which it put on its contract with the defendant
in error. In November, 1875, when it was found that his
plans and those of Egan did not harmonize, the city council
passed a resolution calling a joint meeting of the mayor, the
board of public works, the building committee of the council,
and the president and building committee of the county board,
to consult about some plan by which the difference between
the city and county architects might be satisfactorily settled.
The result of the meeting was a direction to the two architects to prepare a compromise plan for the exterior of the
building.
The compromise plan prepared by Egan appears to have
been adopted by a joint meeting of the same parties held on a
subsequent day. Nevertheless, afterwards, on Jan. 13, 1876,
the city council passed a resolution by which they directed the
board of public works to adopt certain compromise plans prepared by the defendant in error.
All this shows that it was not considered by the city that
the contract imposed on the defendant in error alone the
duty of bringing about the assent to his plans of the county
board.
If the construction we have put upon the contract is the
correct one, then the defendant in error having performed a
part of it according to its terms, and having been prevented
from performing the residue by the failure of the other party
to do its part, may receive compensation for the work actually
performed. PlaniL6 v. Colburn, 8 Bing. 14; Goodman v.

This, in effect, disposes of the assignments of error. All of

parties.
If the defendant was not bound by the contract to obtain
