SMELTING CO. v. KSMP.

SMELTING COPN

[Sup. Ct.

V. KMn i.

Under the circumstances of this case, the court declines to accept the submission
of the cause against the wishes of those who, being collaterally interested in
the decision which may be made, united in the employment of counsel to
present their defence, and contributed to a common fund for the payment
of the expenses of the litigation.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Colorado.
Motion to set aside submission.

Mr. Bobert I. Bradford and Mr. Willis Drummond in support of the motion.
Mr. Alexander T. Britton and Mr. Walter H. Smith, contra.
MR. Cmm_' JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
The showing made on this motion satisfies us that this case,
and the one which follows it on the docket, were brought here
for a determination of the questions on which depends the title
of the St. Louis Smelting and Refining Company to its addition
to Leadville; that the decision of these suits will dispose of a
large number of others now pending in the court below; that
when the suits were begun below all the defendants united in
the employment of counsel to present their defence, and contributed to a common fund for the payment of the expenses of
the litigation; that since these cases have been docketed here
the parties to this have come to an amicable understanding in
respect to the subject-matter of their particular litigation, under
which this submission has been made, through new counsel employed in behalf of the defendants in error and without the
concurrence of those interested in the other case and the suits
still pending below. The questions involved are important.
Under these circumstances we think we ought not to accept
the submission of the cause against the wishes of those collaterally interested in the decision that may be made.
The submission will, therefore, be set aside, and the cause
restored to its place on the docket; and it is
So ordered,
