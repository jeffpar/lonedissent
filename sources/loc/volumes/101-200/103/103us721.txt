UNITED STATES V. STEAMSHIP COMPANY.
The contracts entered into by the United States and the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, for carrying the mails by the latter between San Francisco and
certain Asiatic ports, considered. Hed, 1. That the company has no claim
to compensation other than sea postage for carrying them in vessels which
had not been accepted by the Postmaster-General. 2. That it is entitled to
recover, under the contract of Aug. 23, 1873, for services performed, pursuant
to its terms, in vessels which he had, under the contract of Oct. 16, 1866,
accepted. '. That the annulment of the contract by the act of March 3,
1875, c. 128, does not affect the company's claim for such services on a voyage commenced before that date.

APPEALS from the Court of Claims.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
The Solicitor-General and lir. Edwii B. Smith, Assistant
Attorney-General, for the United States.
Mr. John F. Farnsworth, Mr. William B. Chandler, Mr.
Philip Phillips, Mr. -oseoe Conkling, contra.
AIR. JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.

These are cross-appeals from a judgment of the Court of
Claims. The Pacific Mail Steamship Company asserted in
that court a claim for $531,666.66, and recovered a judgment
for $41,666.66. The United States desire to reverse this latter
judgment. The company seeks to recover here the full sum
claimed below.
The suit grows out of a contract for carrying the mail from
San Francisco to certain Asiatic ports. The facts, as found by
the Court of Claims, and so far as is necessary to our decision,
will be stated as we proceed.
The steamship company entered, on the 16th of October,
1866, into a contract with the United States to carry a monthly
mail from San Francisco to China and Japan, via the Sandwich
Islands, for the sum of $500,000 per annum, for a period of ten
years.
These mails were to be carried in first-class American seavoL. x111.

going side-wheel vessels of from 3,500 to 4,000 tons burden, to
be inspected and accepted by the Postmaster-General. The
company, in due time, entered upon the discharge of this duty.
The steamships " Colorado," " Great Republic," "China,"
"Japan," "America," and "Alaska" were duly inspected and
were accepted by the government for that service. They had
been in actual use in performing the contract for several years,
when Congress by the act of June 1, 1872, c. 256, making
appropriations for the service of the Post-Office Department
for the next fiscal year, enacted as follows : "SECT. 3. .
. For steamship service between San Francisco,
Japan, and China, five hundred thousand dollars; and the Postmas
ter-General is hereby authorized to contract with the lowest bidder,
within three months after the passage of this act, after sixty days'
public notice, for a term of ten years, from and after the first day of
October, eighteen hundred and seventy-three, for the conveyance of
an additional monthly mail, on the said route, at a compensation not
to exceed the rate per voyage now paid, under the existing contracts,
and upon the same conditions and limitations as prescribed by existing acts of Congress in reference thereto, and the respective contracts made in pursuance thereof; and the contractors, under the
provisions of this section, shall be required to carry the United
States mails during the existence of their contracts without additional charge, on all the steamers they may run upon said line, or
any part of it, or any branch or extension thereof: Provided)that
all steamships hereafter accepted for said service shall be of not less
than four thousand tons register each, and shall be. built of iron,
and, with their engines and machinery, shall be wholly of American
construction; and shall be so constructed as to be readily adapted
to the armed naval service of the United States, in case of war,
and, before acceptance, the officers by whom they are inspected
shall report to the Secretary of the Navy and the Postmaster-Gen-

eral whether this condition has been complied with. .

.

. And the

government of the United States shall have the right, in the case
of war, to take for the use of the United States any of the steamers
of said line, and, in such case, pay a reasonable compensation therefor: Provided,the price paid shall in no case exceed the original
cost of the vessel so taken; and the provision shall extend to and
be applicable to the steamers of the Brazilian line hereinafter pro.
vi 3ed for."

"SFcT. 6. That if the contract for the increase of the mail service
between San Francisco and China and Japan to a semi-monthly
service shall be made with the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, or
shall be performed in said company's ships, or the ships of its successors in interest, the moneys payable under such contract shall
be paid while the said company, or its successors ininterest, shall
maintain and run the line of steamships for the transportation of
teight and passengers, at present run between New York and San
Francisco, via the Isthmus of Panama, by the said Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, and no longer: Provided,that said requirements shall, in all respects, apply to any party contracting for the
mail service between San Francisco and China and Japan, as well
as to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company."

After advertising for bids for this service, and receiving one
from the Pacific Mail Company, the Postmaster-General and
the company signed, Aug. 23, 1873, a contract, which is too long
to be copied here in full. On the part of the company, after reciting the times of departure and places of delivery of the mails
which they bound themselves to carry for the period of ten
years, commencing on the first day of October, 1873, there occurs this sentence, on the construction of which the present controversy hinges: "And the said contractors do further covenant
and agree with the United States, and do bind themselves, that
the steamships hereafter offered for the service shall be of not
less than four thousand tons register each, and shall be built of
iron, and, with their engines and machinery, shall be wholly
of American construction, of the best materials and after approved models, and shall be so constructed as to be readily
adapted to the armed naval service of the United States in case
of war; and before acceptance, the officers by whom they are
inspected shall report to the Secretary of the Navy and the
Postmaster-General whether this condition has been complied
with; and, further, that the said steamships, after acceptance
by the Postmaster-General, and during the period they may be
employed in conveying the mails, shall be kept up by alterations, repairs, and additions, as the exigency may require, fully
Equal to the best state of steamship improvement attained;
und if not so kept up and maintained, they may be rejected by
the Postmaster-General of the United States, as not meeting

[Sup. Ct

the requirements of the act of Congress authorizing the addi
tional monthly service, and other satisfactory steamships required in their place." The question is whether the company
was bound by this contract to carry this additional semimonthly mail in vessels of the class here described and in no
others, or whether, while exercising due diligence, to have as
many vessels of that kind as were necessary, in addition to
those which had been accepted under the first contract, these
last could be used in performing the contract. Counsel for the
government maintain that, inasmuch as under this contract but
one trip was made by a vessel of the class here described, the
service rendered by other vessels which had been accepted by
the Postmaster-General, before this contract was made, was
not a service in compliance with the contract for which they
are entitled to receive the $41,666.66 per trip, while the contention of the company is, that it was at liberty to use ships
already accepted for this service, being the same service which
they were then performing under the former contract, except
that it had now become a semi-monthly instead of a monthly
mail, and that by the use of the word "hereafter," in the new
contract, reference was had to such new vessels as it might
become necessary to introduce into that service.
It will be observed that "hereafter" occurs in the act of
1872, under which the contract was made, and in the same
connection. It has no sense either in the statute or the contract, unless there is an implied feference to vessels already
accepted. If we suppose that while Congress required the contract to be let, after public notice, to the lowest bidder, but at
no higher rate than $500,000 per annum, it also had in mind
the great probability that the company which was performing
the contract for a monthly mail at that price would obtain the
contract for the additional service, we can readily understand
the use of the word " hereafter" both in the statute and in
the contract. It being understood that six vessels of that
company had already been inspected and accepted by the
Postmaster-General for that service, and were then engaged
init, the only reasonable use of the agreement that "steamships hereafter offered" should be of the new class, is that
those already accepted might be used under this contract

Oct. 1880.]

STEAMSHIP CO. v. UNITED STATES.

for the same service, but that such other vessels as tLe service should require must be of the higher class described in
the statute.
There are many reasons to believe that while Congress observed its uniform policy of letting such contracts to the lowest
bidder, thus inviting competition, it felt reasonably sure that
in the present case the Pacific Mail Company would get it, if
let at all, as the maximum of <500,000 per annum left an alternative that no contract might be made.
One of these considerations is that the company had for
some time been making semi-monthly trips on the same route
in pursuit of their general business as carriers, and had carried
the mail every trip, receiving for the trip, for which they had
no contract, what is called the sea postages,- a phrase not
explained in the record, but understood to mean the postage
received by the United States for the mail matter actually
carried. If the company was doing this already for such a
small sum, generally less than $1,000 per round trip, it was to
be supposed they could underbid any one else. Besides, it was
well known that no one else was prepared to perform the service, or could afford to put in a competing line for it. That
Congress contemplated the taking of the contract by this company as extremely probable is shown by the provisions of the
sixth section of the act, that if the contract was made with
that company or performed in its ships the money should
only be paid so long as that company should continue its line
from New York to San Francisco by way of Panama. We
have here not only the probability that this contract would be
made by the company which already was running a line of
steamers from New York to San Francisco and was doing the
work from San Francisco to Asia, which was now to be doubled,
but we have the one made to depend on the performance of
the other, and the distinct intimation that the new service
might be performed in the ships of that company. Now,
though this does not necessarily mean ships then in existence,
when taken in connection with the use of the word "hereafter,"
as we have suggested, it adds to the force of the implication
that ships of that company which had already been accepted
might still be used for a service not new, but increased in the

frequency of voyages, if the contract was awarded to the company then performing the service.
The construction of this contract was referred by the Postmaster-General to the Attorney-General in the summer of 1874,
the question being whether the contract had been forfeited or
was liable to be declared so by reason of the fact that while
the new service was to commence Oct. 1, 1873, no vessel of the
higher class described in the contract had been 'offered.
The Solicitor-General in a very careful opinion held that
while the literal terms of the contract might be held to mean
that the additional service should be wholly performed in the
higher class of vessels, the act of Congress under which the
contract was made clearly did not require this.
He says: "It seems to me plain that the act of 1872 did not
require such additional mail service in steamships of the new
class, unless such became necessary."
And while he is of
opinion that the language of the contract does require this, he
considers it to be an immaterial part of the agreement, and
concludes that the failure to provide the new vessels when the
work was as well done by those already accepted did not authorize a forfeiture of the contract.
The Attorney-General also gave an opinion, in which, while
he declines to adopt all of the Solicitor-General's views, he says:
"I am of opinion that it was not an essential part of the contract that the new iron steamships should be furnished by the
1st of October, 1873, if at that time it satisfactorily appeared
that they would be furnished within a reasonable time thereafter." 14 Op. Att.-Gen. 674. It does not appear to us that
there is such a discrepancy between the language of the statute
and of the contract as is suggested by the Solicitor-General, and
if there were, the following words found in the contract would
make the statute govern the case: "This contract shall in all
its parts be subject to, and in all respects governed by, the
requirements and provisions of the third and sixth sections of
the act of Congress approved June 1, 1872." These are the
sections we have copied, and which the Solicitor-General construes as we do, not to require the steamships of the new class
until other vessels became necessary besides those alread3
accepted.

Oct. 1880.]

STEAMSHIP CO. v. UNITED STATES.

That such was the understanding of the parties to this contract receives strong confirmation from language found in the
bid or offer of the company, which was accepted without qualification by the Postmaster-General. It is this: "We are now
building two iron propellers of about 4,500 tons register, capable of steaming twelve knots, and propose, as soon as practicable, with the limited facilities now available in America, to
build two more steamers of like construction, but larger and
of higher speed, all of which we shall offer for the service in
question. Until they can be put into commission, and afterwards, whenever circumstances may require us to relieve them
temporarily, we propose to perform the service with one of the
steamships heretofore accepted for the China mail service, viz.,
'America,' ' Japan,' ' China,' ' Great Republic,' ' Alaska,' and
'Colorado,' or in case of need with the ' Constitution,' heretofore accepted as a spare steamer for said service."
It does not appear that this was objected to, and the finding
of the Court of Claims is that the proposal was accepted as
made; and if there be any difficulty in construing the language
of the contract, it is fair to presume that it was not intended
to conflict directly with such an important part of the proposal,
after it had been accepted without objection.
Two acts of the claimant are much relied on to sustain the
construction of the contract now asserted by the government's
counsel, and it must be confessed that they tend to show that,
about the time the performance of the contract should have
commenced, some of the officers of the steamship company
entertained the view that all the additional service was to be
performed in the new class of vessels.
The first of these is a letter written in behalf of the steam
ship company by S. K. Holman, vice-president, in answer to
one from the Post-Office Department. This latter letter is
dated Oct. 24, 1873, and is addressed to George H. Bradbury,
president of the company, and requests him to put in writing,
for the use of the department, the explanation which, in a
recent personal interview with the Postmaster-General, he had
given for failing to commence the additional service on the 1st
of October, as required by law and contract.
To this Mr. Holman says: -

STEAMSHIP CO. v. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

IISm, -In the matter of the contract between the PostmasterGeneral and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company for an additional
semi-monthly mail service between San Francisco, Japan, and China,
said service to be performed with American-built iron steamships
of not less than 4,000 tons register, and to have been commenced
on Oct. 1, 1873, we beg to submit the following, which will explain
the reason of our failure to have placed the ships on the line as per
contract."
He then proceeds at length to explain the difficulties encountered in the construction of the two ships "City of Pekin " and
"City of Tokio," which had prevented the company from placing in time any vessel of that class in the line. It must be
conceded that this language and the whole tenor of the letter
impliedly admit that it was the duty of the company under the
contract to furnish the new class of vessels at once.
This is further confirmed by the fact that while the mails
were carried twice a month from October 1 to December 31,
on vessels already accepted under the old contract, the sea postage for this service, amounting to $1,510.81, was, on the 11th
of February, 1874, paid to the company at its request.
But immediately thereafter the company refused to receive
any more of the sea postage, though warrants therefor to the
amount of $5,105.41 were tendered, and it continued to perform the additional service, and to demand the contract price
for it, until Congress, by the act of March 8, 1875, c. 128, in
the exercise of the power reserved in the act of June 1, 1872,
repealed that act and annulled the contract.
But the question to be decided is, not how one or more of
the officers of the steamship company construed the contract
several months after it had been made, but what was the intention of the parties thereto, and what did Congress mean
when it enacted this particular proviso. We have already said
that by a just construction of its terms the contract conforms
to the statute, and that the latter did not require the additional
service to be performed exclusively in the new class of vessels.
We have shown that, when bidding for the contract, the company guarded this point by expressly stating they should use
the old vessels.
Is all this to be overcome by the language of a single officei

Oct. 1880.]

STEAMSHIP CO. V. UNITED STATES.

of the company, and that not the highest, and whose authority
in the company is not shown? There is no evidence that the
president of the company, or its board of directors, held these
views.
So the receipt of the sea postage for three months may have
been by the mistaken action of some inferior officer of the company. Long before the new contract was to begin the company
had been performing this additional service and receiving the
sea postage as compensation for it, and it may have been that
some officer, unaware of the new contract, had continued to ask
for and receive these postages after it went into effect. We do
not think these acts are sufficient to overcome the construction
of the contract arising from the statute and the language of the
instrument, and they certainly do not estop the company from
asserting the rights which the true construction of it gives
them.
The Court of Claims finds that the additional mail service
was performed by twelve round trips, beginning Oct. 17, 1873,
and terminating Jan. 16, 1875, and that of these voyages six
were made by ships which had been accepted under the first
contract, and six by vessels which had never been accepted by
the Postmaster-General. We are of opinion that claimant can
only recover on this contract for the service rendered by vessels which had been accepted, and that it cannot recover on
the contract for mails carried in vessels which had not been
accepted under the contract. As to these, the sea postages
offered by the Postmaster-General must be, as it was before
the making of the contract, the only compensation. There may
be deductions for non-performance of duty, or other matters
provided in the contract, in regard to which no finding is made
by the Court of Claims, but which will be open to inquiry on
the return of the case to that court.
As regards the sum allowed claimant for the voyage of the
"City of Pekin," we think the Court of Claims was clearly
right. That vessel had been examined and accepted by the
Postmaster-General, as one of the new and higher class of vessels, and the mails had been delivered to her at San Francisco,
on the 20th of February, 1875, and she had started on the
round trip ten or twelve days before Congress passed the stat

[Sup. Ct.

ute annulling the contract, and she carried the mails under that
contract on the voyage out and the return voyage. We are of
opinion that the repeal of the statute and the annulment of the
contract were not designed to operate on that voyage, and that
in that respect the judgment of the Court of Claims was right.
Its judgment in regard to the other trips will be reversed,
and the case remanded to it with instructions to render a judgment in conformity to this opinion; and it is
