Ex PA TE BuRns.
This court cannot, by mandamus, compel an inferior court to reverse ito decisiou
made in the exercise of its legitimate jurisdiction.
PETITION

for a writ of mandamus.

Mr. A. T. Todd in support of the petition.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is a petition for a mandamus requiring the district
judge for the eastern district of New York to compel one Eliza
M. Shepherd to obey the command of a subpena duces tecum,
and produce before a special examiner certain iron patterns of
an old fire-place heater, that testimony might be taken respecting them, to be certified and used on the hearing of an
equity cause pending in the Circuit Court for the Southern
District of New York. From the petition it appears that the
judge has already acted on the identical showing made to
us, and for reasons assigned in writing denied a motion for an
attachment against the person named for refusing to obey the
subpoena.
A writ of mandamus may be used to compel an inferior tribunal to act on a matter within its jurisdiction, but not to
control its discretion while acting (Ex parte Railway Company,
101 U. S. 711), nor reverse its decisions when made. ExEparte
Plippin, 94 id. 348. Both these rules are elementary, and are
fatal to this application. The district judge took jurisdiction
of the matter, as it was his duty to do, heard the parties, and
decided adversely to the claim of the petitioner. In this he
may have done wrong, and the reasons he has assigned may
not be such as will bear the test of judicial criticism ; but we
cannot, by mandamus, compel him to undo what he has thus
done in the exercise of his legitimate jurisdiction. He was
asked to punish a person for contempt in disobeying the provess of the court. He decided not to do so. This action of
his i. beyond the reach of a writ of mandamus.
Petition denied
