v'.

NEW ORLEANS.

LOUISIANA v. NEW ORLEANS.
A cause, not presenting questions entitling it to precedence, will not, over the
objection of a party thereto, be advanced in order that it may be heard with
another case standing before it on the docket.

ERROR to the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana.
Motion to advance.
Mr. oin A. Campbell and M1r. Bdcward Bermudez in support
of the motion.
Mr. Benjamnn F. Jonas and Mr. Henry aMiller,
I.
contra.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
We decided at the last term that this case did not present
questions which entitled it to a hearing in advance of others
standing before it on the docket. It is now suggested that
United States v. lNew Orleans involves the consideration of the
same questions and the construction of the same statute, and
we are asked to advance this case to be heard with that. To
this the defendant in error objects. When a case is advanced
to be heard with another which has precedence on the docket,
the rule is to require the two to be argued as one. This rule
is never departed from except under very peculiar circumstances. As we cannot compel a party against his will to
argue his case with another, we have always heretofore denied
motions of that kind when they are resisted. There are no
such special circumstances in this case as to make it proper
that it be advanced and heard separately from the other. The
motion to advance will, therefore, be overruled, but counsel may
submit printed arguments in the other case on the questions
presented in that which are common to the two, provided
twenty copies of such arguments are filed with the clerk at
least six days before that case comes up for hearing.
Motion overruled
