SCOVnLL v. THAYER.
1. Certificates of stock of an incorporated company issued in excess of the limit
imposed by its charter are void, and the holder of them is not entitled to
the rights, nor subject to the liabilities, of a holder of authorized stock.
2. le is not estopped to set up the invalidity of such unauthorized stock as
a defence to an action by creditors against him, to recover the balance
unpaid thereon, by the fact that he attended the meeting at which it was
voted to issue the same, or that he received and held certificates therefor,
or that the officers and agents of the company represented its capital to
be equal to the amount of both its authorized and unauthorized stock.
3. When the company which issued stock beyond such limit has been adjudicated
bankrupt, the holder of the unauthorized stock is not entitled to have
the money paid thereon applied as a credit on the unpaid balance due on
his authorized stock.
4. Subscribers to the stock of an incorporated company paid twenty per cent on
their shares, and entered into an agreement with the company that no further assessments should be made thereon, and certificates for full-paid shares
were issued to them. The company was adjudicated a bankrupt, and to
satisfy the clais of its creditors it became necessary to assess the unpaid
stock, leld, 1. Tit
the agreement was in equity void as to creditors.
2. That before al action at law can be maintained by the assignees in
bankruptcy against a stockholder to recover upon his unpaid subscription
of stock, some proceedings in the interest of creditors are necessary in a
court of competent jurisdiction, to set aside the agreement, and to make
an assessment upon such unpaid stock. 3. That until an order of such
court to that effect, and an assessment, or some authorized demand upon
the stockholder to pay the balance due on his stock, no cause of actiop accrues against him in favor of the assignees, and the limitation prescribed by
the second section of the Bankrupt Act does not begin to run in his favor.

Emtot to the Circuit Court of the United States for the

District of Massachusetts.
On Nov. 25, 1870, the Fort Scott Coal and Mining Company
was organized as a corporate body under the General Laws of

the State of Kansas, with a capital stock of ,100,000.
According to the laws of that State, any corporation might
increase its capital stock to any amount not exceeding double

its authorized capital.
Under the provision of this law the corporation, on April
19, 1871, increased its capital stock from $100,000 to $200,000.
On Oct. 16, 1872, the corporation attemptcd, by taking the
steps required by law for the lawful increase of stock, to increase its capital stock to $300,000, and on Dec. 27, 1872, to

SCOVILL v. THAYER.

[Sup. Cf.

make a further increase of $100,000. The nominal capital
was thus raised to the sum of $400,000.
Nathaniel Thayer, the defendant in error, who was a holder
of shares in the company, attended by proxy the meetings of
the stockholders at which the third and fourth issues of stock
were voted. After this attempted increase of the stock, the
officers and agents of the company, by advertisements, billheads, and verbally, represented that its capital stock was
$400,000.
Thayer was the holder of two hundred and eighty-five shares
of the first two issues of stock. On two hundred of these
shares he had paid to the company $20 per share, and on the
remaining eighty-five he had paid $40 per share. Ile was also
the holder of five hundred and eighty-five shares of the third
and fourth issues, upon which he had paid the company $50
per share. No other payments were ever made by him on his
shares of stock.
The other stockholders paid the same amounts on the shares
of stock of the several issues held by them respectively. By
agreement made at the date of the several issues of stock the
amounts paid thereon were credited to the subscribers, and the
balance unpaid credited by "discount," and certificates as for
full-paid shares were delivered to the subscribers, and the stock
account between the company and them balanced by such
"discount."
On April 2, 1874, a petition in bankruptcy was filed against
the company in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The company was adjudicated a bankrupt on
the eleventh, and the plaintiffs in error were appointed its
assignees on the twenty-ninth day of that month. On March
31, 1876, the assignees filed their petition in that court, wherein
they prayed for an order directing them to make an assessment
and call upon the unpaid stock of the company for the purpose
of paying its debts.
In their petition the assignees represented as follows: " At
the date of adjudication in bankruptcy the affairs of said company were in a very embarrassed and complicated condition,
and much time has been necessarily consumed and considerable
expense incurred in opposing claims attempted to be estab-

lished in said bankrupt court for failures on the part of said
company to comply with contracts made by it. Many fraudulent claims for large amounts have been filed against said
bankrupt, requiring time to oppose and defeat, which have
been defeated. The litigated claims are now reduced to a
small number, not covering more than ten thousand six hundred and one dollars and eighty cents. The property of the
company on hand at the date of adjudication in bankruptcy has
been disposed of as rapidly as seemed conducive to the interests of all concerned. The sale of a portion of the real estate
has been delayed in the hope that the demand for land would
increase, and your petitioners realize something out of it for
the benefit of the creditors. Your petitioners believe, however, that any further delay in the disposal of the bankrupt's
property would not be advantageous.
" Your petitioners had intended before making this application to have fully closed up the contest over litigated
claims, disposed of assets of the company, and collected all
its bills receivable, but find it is impossible to accomplish
it without a longer postponement than is convenient or expedient."
The petition further averred that " the amount of the liabilities of the bankrupt over and above the assets is $124,684,
while the amount yet due and unpaid on the stock held and
owned by said stockholders is $222,650."
By an amendment to their petition, the assignees represented as follows: " That an assessment of seventy-six per cent
upon the par value of each share of stock in said company, if
credited with the amount paid each stockholder heretofore,
would equalize the burden upon the stockholders, and also
bring into the hands of your petitioners a sufficient amount to
pay the debts of the company."
Upon the filing of this petition, the court made an order
that all the stockholders of the bankrupt company show
cause on April 21, 1876, why the assessment and call prayed
for in said petition should not be made, and that the assignees cause a copy of the order to show cause to be mailed
to each stockholder at his usual place of residence and address, and also give notice by publication in the " Fort Scott

Daily Monitor," for at least ten days before the said April
21, 1876.
By order of the court, the hearing of the rule was postponed to June 10, 1876. R. S. Watson, a stockholder, had in
the mean time filed exceptions to the rule, on behalf of himself
and all other stockholders desiring to avail themselves thereof.
On the date last named, the petition and amended petition of
the assignees, and the exceptions thereto, came on for hearing,
whereupon the court overruled the exceptions, and decreed that
an assessment and call be miade upon the stock of the company
of seventy-six per cent, upon which should be credited to each
stockholder any sums paid by him on his shares, and that the
sum so assessed should be paid to the assignees on or before
Aug. 1, 1876, and in default of payment they were directed to
sue for and collect the same.
On July 17, 1876, the assignees made an assessment and call
as authorized by the order and decree of the District Court,
and gave notice thereof to the stockholders; but before the
assessment could be collected, Watson, the stockholder before
mentioned, filed with the circuit judge a petition for the reversal of the order and decree of the District Court authorizing
the assessment and call.
It does not appear from the record upon what day this petition was filed. But on Dec. 4, 1876, the decision of the circuit
judge thereon was transmitted to the District Court, affirming
its decree, "with this modification: that the said District
Court enter an order allowing each stockholder of said bankrupt company who shall pay the amount of said assessment on
his stock in ninety days from this twenty-ninth day of November, 1876, a credit on his or her proportion of the amount so
assessed as was included in said assessment for the purpose
of paying the costs of enforcing by suit the collection of said
assessment."
The District Court, on Dec. 4, 1876, entered a decree in conformity with the order of the circuit judge.
Thayer having failed to pay within the time limited by the
court the assessment made upon him on account of his stock,
although served with notice to do so, the assignees, on April 9,
1877, brought against him, in the Circuit Court of the United

Oct. 1881.]

SCOVILL v. THAYER.

States for the District of Massachusetts, an action at law to recover the sum of $27,160, the amount of the assessment on his
unpaid stock.
The declaration alleged in substance the facts above recited.
The defendant filed two pleas, the first of which was a general denial of the allegations of the declaration, and the second
set up the limitation of two years prescribed by sect. 2 of the
act of March 2, 1867, c. 176, and now embodied in the Revised
Statutes as sect. 5057.
The case was submitted to the Circuit Court upon an agreed
statement of facts. The court found for the defendant, holding, in an opinion which appears in the record, that the cause
of action was barred by the limitation of two years pleaded.
Judgment was, therefore, rendered for him. The plaintiffs
below brought the case here, and assign for error the ruling
upon the Statute of Limitations and the rendition of the judgment for defendant.
Mr. J. -E. MeKeighan and Mr. A. A. Ranney for the plaintiffs in error.
Mr. Sidney Bartlett, Mr. William G. Russell, and Mr. George
Putnam for the defendant in error.
MR. JusTICE WooDs, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
The averments made in the declaration were substantially
supported by the agreed statement, and there should have been
judgment thereon for the plaintiffs, unless, upon the facts
as disclosed, they were shown not to be entitled to a recovery
on the merits, or unless the Statute of Limitations was a bar to
the action.
The defendant insists, first, that the third and fourth issues
of stock, which were made after the limit had been reached,
within which the amount of capital stock of the company was
restricted by the laws of Kansas, were absolutely void, and no
assessment could be made on them which he was bound to
pay; secondly, that the sums voluntarily paid by him upon
his void stock should be applied to the payment of the balance due on his valid stock, and that when so applied they

SCOVILL v. THAYER.

[Sup. Ct.

would fully satisfy the assessment thereon; and, thirdly, that
in any event the facts sustained the plea of the Statute of
Limitations. We shall consider these contentions in the order
stated.
The Constitution of Kansas forbids special charters. Art.
12, sect. 1. All corporations in that State are, therefore, organized under genei'al laws. The Fort Scott Coal and Mining
Company was organized under the general law of the State,
which, with its articles of incorporation, that were required
to be filed with the secretary of state, constituted its charter.
By those articles the original stock of the company was fixed
at $100,000. Chap. 23, sect. 14, of the Statutes of Kansas
provides that " any incorporation may increase its capital
stock to any amount not exceeding double the amount of its
authorized capital." The second issue increased the stock to
$200,000, which was the limit prescribed by the charter. The
question, therefore, is whether the stock of the third and fourth
issues, by which the aggregate amount was raised to $400,000,
is or is not void.
As a general rule, corporations can have and exercise only
such powers as are expressly conferred on them by the act of
incorporation, and such implied powers as are necessary to enable them to perform their prescribed duties. Fertilizing Company v. Hyde Park, 97 U. S. 659; Salomons v. Laing, 12
Bea . 339; Eastern Counties Railway v. Hawkes, 5 I. L. Cas.
331.
And it is well settled that a corporation has no implied power
to change the amount of its capital as prescribed in its charter,
and that all attempts to do so are void. Mechanics' Bank v.
Taven Railroad Co., 13 N. Y. 5997; New
New
N'
New York
Yorl & New Haven Railroad Co. v. chuyler, 34 id. 30; Railway Company v. Allerton, 18 Wall. 233; Stace J&Worth's Case,
Law Rep. 4 Ch. App. 682, note.
In this case the attempt to increase the stock of the company
beyond the limit fixed by its charter was ultra vires. The increased stock itself was, therefore, void. It conferred on the
holders no rights and subjected them to no liabilities. If the
stock of the first and second issues had been held by one set of
holders, and the stock of the third and fourth by another, in a

Oct. 1881.]

SCOVILL v. THAYER.

contest between them the latter would have been excluded
from all participation in the management of the company or
in its profits. To decide that the holders of stock issued ultra
vires have the same rights as the holders of authorized stock,
is to ignore and override the limitations and prohibitions of
the charter. We think it follows that if the holder of such
spurious stock has none of the rights, he can be subjected to
none of the liabilities of a holder of genuine stock. His contract to pay for spurious shares is without consideration and
cannot be enforced.
It is insisted, however, that the defendant having attended
by proxy the meetings at which the increase of the stock beyond the -limit imposed by law was voted for, and having
received certificates for the stock thus voted for, and after such
increase the company by its agents having held itself out as
possessing a capital of $400,000, and invited and obtained
credit on the faith of such representations, he is now estopped
from denying the validity of the stock and his obligation to
pay for it in full.
We think that he is not estopped to set up the nullity of
the unauthorized stock. It is true that it has been held by
this court that a stockholder cannot set up informalities in the
issue of stock which the corporation had the power to create.
Upton v. Tribileoec, 91 U. S. 45 ; Chubb v. Upton, 95 id. 665 ;
Pullman v. Upton, 96 id. 328. But those were cases where
the increase of the stock was authorized by law. The increase
itself was legal and within the power of the corporation, but
there were simply informalities in the steps taken to effect the
increase. These, it was held, were cured by the acts and acquiesdence of the defendant.
But here, the corporation being absolutely without power to
increase its stock above a certain limit, the acquiescence of the
shareholder can neither give it validity, nor bind him or the
corporation.
" A distinction must be made between shares
which the company had no power to issue and shares which
the company had power to issue, although not in the manner
in which, or upon the terms upon which, they have been
issued. The holders of shares which the company has no
power to issue, in truth had nothing at all, and are not

contributors. ' 2 Lindley, Partnership, 138. And see Lathrop v. Kneeland, 46 Barb. (N. Y.) 432; Maecley's Case,
1 Ch. D. 247.
In Stace & Worth's Case (supra) it appeared that there
was an agreement for the amalgamation of the London Northern Insurance Corporation and the Life Investment Mortgage
Insurance Company, the two corporations to be formed into
one, under the name of the corporation first mentioned. The
corporation was to issue shares in exchange for those held in
the company, and the amalgamated board was to consist of the
five directors of the corporation, and of seven of the directors of
the company, to be selected by themselves. After the amalganiation Stace and Worth, it was alleged, received and accepted certificates for shares in the corporation in exchange for their shares
in the company, and they with five others were appointed directors of the corporation. Afterwards a resolution was passed for
voluntarily winding up the corporation, and the names of Stace
and Worth were placed upon the list of contributors. An application to have their names removed from the list was made
to Vice-Chancellor James, who, after hearing the case argued, directed their names to be removed. This was done on
the ground that the agreement for amalgamation was beyond
the powers of the corporation, and, therefore, void. In giving the reasons for his decision he said: "It is, however, contended that notwithstanding the agreement itself was ultra
vires and void, yet there are personal acts and things personally affecting these two gentlemen which render them still
liable as shareholders."
These were the acceptance of shares
by Stace and Worth, the fact that their names appeared on
the register of shareholders, and that they had sat as directors of the corporation after the attempted amalgamation.
But he declared: "This was a void agreement with a void
acting upon it, a void recognition, and a void ratification by
the acts which have been mentioned. It comes to an aggregate of nothings, and that aggregate of nothings is all
that there is to fix those gentlemen on the list of stockholders."
So in Zabrislcie v. Cleveland, Columbus, ,P Cincinnati Railroad Co. (23 How. 381), this court, after holding the railroad

company to be liable on certain bonds which it was alleged
had been indorsed by the directors without lawful authority,
added: " This principle does not impugn the doctrine that a
corporation cannot vary from the object of its creation, and
that persons dealing with a company must take notice of whatever is contained in the law of its organization."
Upon the principles stated in these authorities, we are of
opinion that the defendant is not estopped by any acts of his,
to assert the invalidity of the stock issued in excess of the
limit authorized by the charter, and to deny his liability
thereon.
It would seem to follow that if he is not estopped by
his own acts, he is not by the acts of the agents of the Fort
Scott Coal and Mining Company, in representing the coinpany, by advertisements and otherwise, as having a capital of
$400,000.
The officers of the company had no authority to make these
representations, and the public no right to trust them. Persons
dealing with the managers of a corporation must take notice
of the limitations imposed upon their authority by the act of
incorporation. Zabriskie v. The Cleveland, Columbus, J Cincinnati Railroad Co., supra. The laws secured to the public
and the creditors an infallible mode of ascertaining the real
capital of the company. They were bound to know that the
law permitted no such increase of its capital stock as the company had attempted to make, and that any representation that
it had been made was false.
As forcibly suggested by counsel, a, creditor, who has been
defrauded by misrepresentation of the real capital of the coinpany, has his remedy in an action of tort against all who
participated in the fraud. But the wrong done to him cannot
entitle the entire body of creditors, who have not suffered
from the alleged fraud, to recover of the entire body of stockholders, who have taken no part in it.
We are of opinion, therefore, that the defendant is not
estopped by the acts of the agents and officers of the company
to allege the nullity of the overissue stock, and his nonliability to an assessment on such void stock.
The next question for our consideration is whether he is

SCOVILL V. THAYER.

[Sup. Ct.

entitled to offset against his liability to pay the sum due on
his valid stock, the money paid on his void stock.
It is a general rule that a bolder of claims against an insolvent corporation cannot set them off against his liability for
an assessment on his stock in the corporation in a suit by
an assignee in bankruptcy. Sawyer v. floay, 17 Wall. 610;
,Sanger v. Upton, 91 U. S. 56; Sanmmon v. Kimball, 92 id.
362; County of ilorgan v. Allen, 103 id. 498.
The ground upon which this rule stands is thus stated by
Mr. Justice Miller in Sawyer v. Hoag: " The debt which the
appellant owed for his stock was a trust fund devoted to the
payment of all the creditors of the company. As soon as
the company became insolvent, and this fact became known to
the appellant, the right of set-off for an ordinary debt to its full
amount ceased. It became a fund belonging in equity to all
its creditors, and could not be appropriated by the debtor to
the exclusive payment of his own claim."
The defendant seeks to avoid the application of this rule
to his case, on the ground that the real capital of the company was only $200,000, and this constituted the trust fund for
the security of the debts of the company; that all the money
that had been paid in as capital stock bad been paid into that
fund, and that the party paying any money to that fund was
entitled to credit upon his dues thereto.
We cannot assent to this view. He was as much bound to
know the limits of the charter of the company in which he
was a stockholder, as the public or creditors of the company.
He knew, therefore, that all stock issued beyond the limit
fixed by the charter was absolutely void. When he paid in
his money on the void stock, he knew that he was not paying
it on the valid stock, and be is presumed to have known that
it was not a good payment on the valid stock. The company
had no right to apply it on the valid stock, without his direction. He never directed such application, and it remained in
the possession of the company until the rights of the assignees
in bankruptcy attached. To say that it was a contribution to
the trust fund devoted to the payment of the creditors of the
company is an entire misapprehension. It could not be such
contribution unless it were a payment on the stock, and this,

Oct. 1881.]

SCOVILL V. THAYER.

we have seen, was not the case. No call had been made for
payment on the valid stock, to which the amounts paid on the
void stock could be said to apply. No call could have been made
by the company under its agreement with the stockholders, unless to pay its creditors, and it does not appear that when the
payments were made the company had any creditors. It was a
voluntary payment for the benefit of the company, and tended
to increase the value of the authorized stock. In that way the
stockholder got the benefit of it. There is no rule of law or
equity which entitles him, in a contest between himself and a
creditor of the company, either to receive a credit for it on his
unpaid stock, or to have it repaid to him pro rata out of the
assets of the company. We are of opinion, therefore, that it
could not be offset against the money due on the valid stock
held by him.
We are next to consider whether, upon the facts as disclosed
by the record, the defence of the Statute of Limitations should
have been sustained. The precise question with which we
have to deal is, When would this action at law, brought by the
assignees of the bankrupt company against a stockholder, to
recover a part of the balance due on his stock, be barred by
the statute ?
This will depend on the answer to the question, When did
the cause of action accrue to the assignees ? In other words,
When could they have commenced this action against this defendant to recover the amount due on his stock? Wilcox v.
Plummer's -Ex'rs, 4 Pet. 172; Amy v. Dubuque, 98 U. S.
470.
The stock held by the defendant was evidenced by certificates of full-paid shares. It is conceded to have been the
contract between him and the company that he should never
be called uppn to pay any further assessments upon it. The
same contract was made with all the other shareholders,
and the fact was known to all. As between them and the
company this was a perfectly valid agreement. It was not
forbidden by the charter or by any law or public policy,
and as between the company and the stockholders was just
as binding as if it had been expressly authorized by the
charter.

SCOVILL v. THAYER.

[Sup. Ct.

If the company, for the purpose of increasing its business,
had called upon the stockholders to pay up that part of their
stock, which had been satisfied "by discount" according to
their contract, they could have successfully resisted such a demand. No suit could have been maintained by the company
to collect the unpaid stock for such a purpose. The shares
were issued as full paid, on a fair understanding, and that
bound the company.
In fact, it has been held in recent English cases that not
only is the company but its creditors also are bound by such a
contract. Waterhouse v. J-amieson, Law Rep. 2 H. L. (Sc.)
29; Currie's Case, 3 De G., J. & S. 367; Carling, Hespeler,
and Walsh's Cases, 1 Ch. D. 115.
But the doctrine of this court is, that such a contract, though
binding on the company, is a fraud in law on its creditors,
which they can set aside; that when their rights intervene
and their claims are to be satisfied, the stockholders can be required to pay their stock in full. Sawyer v. Iloag, Assignee, 17
Wall. 610; New Albany v. Burke, 11 id. 96; Burke v. Smith,
16 id. 390.
The reason is, that the stock subscribed is considered in
equity as a trust fund for the payment of creditors. Wood v.
Dummer, 3 Mas. 308; Mumma v. Potomac Co., 8 Pet. 281;
Ogilvie v. Knox Insurance Co., 22 How. 387; Sawyer v. Hoag,
supra. It is so held out to the public, who have no means of
knowing the private contracts made between the corporation
and its stockholders. The creditor has, therefore, the right to
presume that the stock subscribed has been or will be paid up,
and if it is not, a court of equity will at his instance require
it to be paid.
In this case the managers and agents of the bankrupt coinpany had in effect represented to the public that all its capital
stock had been subscribed for, and had been or would be paid
in full. Considered, therefore, in the view of a court of equity,
the contract between the company and its stockholders was this,
namnely, that the stockholders should pay, say, for example,
twenty dollars per share on their stock and no more, unless it
became necessary to pay more to satisfy the creditors of the company, and when the necessity arose and the amount required

Oct. 1881.]

SCOVILL V. THAYER.

was ascertained, then to make such additional payment on the
stock as the satisfaction of the claims of creditors required.
When the company was adjudicated a bankrupt, the assignees were bound by this contract, thus equitably construed.
Their duty was to collect a sufficient sum upon the unpaid
stock, which, with the other assets of the cnompany, would be
sufficient to satisfy the company's creditors. They were authorized to collect no more. If it should turn out that the
other assets were sufficient, no action would lie against the
stockholder for the balance due on his stock. For if in a
bankruptcy proceeding any surplus remained after payment of
debts, it would go to the company and not to the stockholders.
And we have seen that the company in this case would have
no right to any surplus.
The question for solution is, therefore, When, under the facts
of this case, did the cause of action accrue against the defendant in error? Certainly not until it became his duty to pay
according to the terms of his contract or according to law.
It is well settled that when stock is subscribed to be paid
upon call of the company, and the company refuses or neglects
to make the call, a court of equity may itself make the call,
if the interests of the creditors require it. The court will do
what it is the duty of the company to do. Curry v. Woodward,
53 Ala. 371; Robinson v. Bank of Darien, ie., 18 Ga. 65;
Ward v. Griswoldville Manufacturing Co., 16 Conn. 593. But
under such circumstances, before there is any obligation upon
the stockholder to pay without an assessment and call by the
company, there must be some order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, or, at the very least, some authorized demand
upon him for payment. And it is clear the Statute of Limitations does not begin to run in his favor until such order or
demand. Van Hook v. Whitloek, 3 Paige (N. Y.), 409; Salisbury v. Black's Adm'r, 6 Har. & J. (Md.) 293 ; Sinkler v. The
Turnpike Company, 3 Pa. 149; Walter v. Walter, 1 Whart.
(Pa.) 292; Qaiqg v. Kittredge, 18 N. H. 137; Nimmo v. Walker,
14 La. Ann. 581.
In this case there was no obligation resting on the stockholder to pay at all until some authorized demand in behalf
of creditors was made for payment. The defendant owed the

SCOVILL V. THAYER.

[Sup. Ct.

creditors nothing, and he owed the company nothing save such
unpaid portion of his stock as might be necessary to satisfy
the claims of the creditors. Upon the bankruptcy of the
company his obligation was to pay to the assignees, upon
demand, such an amount upon his unpaid stock as would be
sufficient, with the other assets of the company, to pay its
debts. He was under no obligation to pay any more, and he
was under no obligation to pay anything until the amount
necessary for him to pay was at least approximately ascertained.
Until then his obligation to pay did not become complete.
But not only was it necessary that the amount required to
satisfy creditors should be ascertained, but that the agreement
between the company andthe stockholder to the effect that
the latter should not be required to make any further payments on his stock should be set aside as in fraud of creditors.
No action at law would lie to recover the unpaid balance due
on the stock until this was done. The proceeding for an
assessment in the bankruptcy court was in effect a proceeding
to accomplish two purposes: first, to set aside the contract
between the company and the stockholder; and, second, to fix
the amount which he should be required to pay. Until these
things were done the cause of action against the stockholder
did not accrue, although his primary obligation was assumed
at the time when he subscribed the stock.
It appears from the petition of the assignees for an assessment upon the stock of the bankrupt company, that they had
used due diligence to ascertain what additional payments on
the stock would be required to pay off the claims of creditors ;
that at as early a time as possible they applied to the court
for an order directing that the stockholders should pay a part
of the amount due on their shares of stock, and assessing the
stock therefor ; that the order was made accordingly, and
within five months thereafter this action at law was begun to
enforce its payment.
If, therefore, the right to bring this suit did not accrue to
the assignees until the assessment was made upon the stock by
the court, and the stockholders were required to pay it, the
action was brought long before the limitation of the statute
could bar it.

SCOVILL V. THAYER.

All the delay which has occurred has been caused by the
proceedings of the assignees, taken for the benefit of the stockholders, in order that they might not be subjected to unnecessary and onerous exactions. The lapse of time between the
filing of the petition for the assessment and the decree of the
bankruptcy court thereon is chargeable to continuances made
by order of the court and to the opposition of the stockholder
referred to. It does not lie in the mouth of the defendant to
say that, while the steps necessary to fix his liability and limit
its amount were being taken, the bar of the statute has intervened and cut off his liability altogether.
The cases cited by the defendant to sustain his contention,
that the cause of action accrued to the assignees in bankruptcy at the time of their appointment, are clearly distinguishable from this. In Terry v. Tabman (92 U. S. 156), the
suit was by a bill-holder of an insolvent bank against a stockholder to enforce the individual liability of the latter to pay
the bills of the bank held by the former. The court decided
that the case was not so much like that of the guarantee of
the collection of a debt, where a previous proceeding against
the principal is implied, as it was like a guarantee of payment
where resort may be had at once to the guarantor, without a
previous proceeding against the principal. The conclusion of
the court, therefore, was that the cause of action in favor of
the bill-holder arose against the stockholder when the bank
ceased to redeem its notes and became notoriously and continuously insolvent. It is clear that this authority has no application to the question in hand.
The case of Terry v. Anderson (95 U. S. 628), also relied on
by the defendant, was a suit in equity to enforce the individual liability of the stockholders of a bank, and to collect
unpaid subscriptions to its capital stock. There was no agreement on the part of the bank not to collect the balance due
on the stock. The bank itself could have enforced payment,
without regard to the necessity for its collection, to satisfy
the debts of the bank. And so the court held that the Statute of Limitations began to run against the bank and its
creditors, in favor of the stockholder, when the bank stopped
payment.

SCOVILL V. THAYER.

[Sup. Ct.

In Baker v. Atlas Bank (9 Mete. (Mass.), 182), and Commonwealth v. Coehituate Banc (3 Allen (Mass.), 42), also relied on
by the defendant, it appeared that upon suspension of payment by the banks there was a present and unconditional liability of their stockholders, which the court held was barred
by the limitation of six years. In the case of Baker v. Atlas
Bank the court said: " The demand sought to be enforced in
this suit was a debt alleged to be due to the bank. Whenever,
therefore, the bank became insolvent by the loss of its capital
stock an action accrued to the bank, according to the construction of the thirtieth section (Rev. Stat., c. 36), which is contended for by plaintiff's counsel to recover the sun from the
stockholders respectively, equal to each one's share of stock.
The statute, therefore, began to run in strictness immediately
on the loss of the capital stock, and certainly when the bank
stopped payment, and after the lapse of six years from that
time the debt was barred."
But in the present case, as we have seen, there was, as between the company and its stockholders, no obligation on the
part of the latter to pay the residue of their stock, unless it
became necessary to satisfy creditors. We think, therefore, we
are safe in saying that the statute did not begin to run in favor
of the stockholders until at the very least the necessity for the
payment had been ascertained, and an authorized demand of
payment made.
It is said by the defendant that to hold that the suit to
recover the sums due on the stock held by him is not barred
would defeat the policy of the Bankrupt Act, which is a speedy
settlement of the bankrupt's estate and the equitable distribution of his assets among the creditors.
Unquestionably a prompt administration of the bankrupt's
assets was one of the ends which that act had in view; but
this policy must be held to be subordinate to a just regard
for the rights of both the creditors and debtors of the bankrupt estate. The debtor cannot be forced to pay before his
contract requires it, merely because the assignee may be in
haste to close up the estate. If his obligation were evidenced
by a promissory note due at a future day, he could not be
compelled to pay it before maturity in order that the estate

SCOVILL v. THAYER.

might be speedily settled. So if some act must be done by
the assignee, such as a demand of payment before his liability is fixed, he cannot be compelled to pay until the prerequisites have been performed. In short, until an unconditional
liability to pay something is fastened on the debtor no action
can be maintained against him, and the Statute of Limitations
does not begin to run in his favor. The suggestion that the
assignee may postpone indefinitely the necessary steps to fix
the liability of the debtor, and thus defeat the policy of the
law, does not answer the proposition that the debtor cannot be
sued until a cause of action has accrued against him. It
is presumed that the assignee will do his duty. If he fails
to do it he is subject to the order of the bankruptcy court,
which, at the instance of those interested, can compel him
to act.
Our opinion is, therefore, that this action at law, prosecuted by the plaintiffs, assignees in bankruptcy of the Fort
Scott Coal and Mining Company, against the defendant, to
recover from him the balance due on his unpaid valid stock
in said company, was not barred by the limitation of two years
prescribed by the Bankrupt Act.
For the error in holding that the action was barred, the judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the cause
remanded with directions to award a
New trial.
MR. JUSTICE FIELD and MR. JUSTICE GRAY dissented.
