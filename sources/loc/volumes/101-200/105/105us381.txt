1. The act of Feb. 16, 1875, c. 77, whereby the appellate jurisdiction of this
court in admiralty causes is limited to the determination of questions of
law arising on the record is constitutional.
2. Where the court below, when thereunto requested, refuses to give any finding
upon an ultimate disputed fact, established by competent evidence and
which is involved in the cause, and material to its dletermination, or where,
against remonstrance, it finds such a fact, in the absence of all evidence,
the ruling, if excepted to at the tiie, and incorporated in a bill of excep-.

3. The court condemns the practice of drawing up bills of exception, which, so
far from being "prepared as in actions at law," are fraiied as, if possible,
to secure here a re-examination of the facts.
4. The court, upon the facts found, affirms the decree below.

The libel filed in the District Court alleges that, in accordance with the terms of the charter-party, Sherman was appointed chief engineer of the steamer, and Denison her captain ;
that the libellants took her to Philadelphia, where they fitted
her with refrigerators and other appliances for, bringing a
cargo of fresh beef from Galveston to Philadelphia, and then
despatched her to Galveston ; that on the outward voyage the
vessel gave signs of unseaworthiness in the blowing and leaking of some of her boiler-tubes, by which the time of the
voyage was fourteen instead of ten days, the usual time ; that
at Galveston the chief engineer was notified by the libellants
to make repairs, &c., but lie refused, whereby she, having taken
a cargo of about seventy tons of fresh beef, was, Oct. 31, 1872,
being then four hours at sea, out of the port of Galveston, compelled to put back there for repairs by reason of the boilertubes again blowing out and leaking, and was detained at.
Galveston seven days for repairs, leaving there again Nov. 7,
1872, and was fifteen days making the passage to Philadelphia,
owing to the unseaworthy and defective condition of the boiler;
and that by reason of these detentions and of the unseaworthy
condition of the boiler, and also of the hot water which escaped
from the boiler-tubes and was negligently allowed to run into
the steamer's bilge and melt the ice in the refrigerators where
the fresh beef was stowed, the beef became spoiled and entirely
lost, to the damage of libellants $30,000, which they claim to
recover.
The steamer was attached, but was subsequently released,
upon the claimants entering into the usual stipulations conformably to the rules qnd practice of that court. The claimants answered, admitting the making of the charter-party, the
appointment of the chief engineer and captain, and the libellants' taking possession of the steamer. They deny all the
other material allegations of the libel, and aver that she, as far

as they were bound to do, was kept as required by the contract.
The District Court dismissed the libel, and the Circuit Court
entered a decree of affirmance. The libellants excepted to
certain of the findings of fact and to the refusal to find certain
facts by them requested and to the conclusions of law. They
thereupon appealed here. The bill of exceptions is incorporated in the record.
The remaining facts appear in the opinion of the court.

for the appellants.
Mr. William Allen Butler, contra.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.

Three questions have been presented on the argument of
this appeal 1. Whether Congress has the constitutional power to confine
the jurisdiction of this court on appeals in admiralty to questions
of law arising on the record;
2. Whether, upon the bill of exceptions, the court below
erred in refusing to find certain facts which, as is claimed, were
established by uncontradicted evidence, and in finding others
which had no evidence at all to support them; and,
3. Whether, on the facts found, the decree below was right.
1. As to the jurisdiction.
If we understand correctly the position of the counsel for the
appellants, it is precisely the samne as that which occupied the
attention of the court in Wiseart v. Danchy, decided at February Term, 1796, 3 Dall. 321. There the question was, what,
under the Judiciary Act of 1789, could be considered on a writ
of error bringing to this court for review a decree in admiralty.
The decision turned on the construction to be given the
twenty-second section of the act, and Mr. Justice Wilson, in
his minority opinion, said : " Such an appeal," that is to say, an
appeal in which all the testimony is produced in this court, " is
expressly sanctioned by the Constitution ; it may, therefore,
clearly, in the first view of the subject, be considered as the
most regular process; and as there are not any words in the

Oct. 1881.]

THE I, FRANCIS WRIGtiHT."

judicial act restricting the power of proceeding by appeal, it
must be regarded as still permitted and approved. Even,
indeed, if positive restriction existed by law, it would, in my
judgment, be superseded by the superior authority of the constitutional provision." Mr. Chief Justice Ellsworth, however,
who spoke for the majority of the court, said: " If Congress
has provided no rule to regulate our proceedings, we cannot
exercise an appellate jurisdiction ; and if the rule is provided,
we cannot depart from it. The question, therefore, on the
constitutional point of appellate jurisdiction, is simply whether
Congress has established a rule for regulating its exercise."
And, further on: "It is observed that a writ of error is a
process more limited in its effects than an appeal; but widatever may be the operation, if an appellate jurisdiction can only
be exercised by this court conformably to such regulations as
are made by the Congress, and if Congress has prescribed a
writ of error, and no other mode, by which it is to be exercised,
still, I say, we are bound to pursue that mode, and can neither
make, nor adopt, another." And again: "But surely it cannot be deemed a denial of justice that a man shall not be permitted to try his cause two or three times over. If he has one
opportunity for the trial of all the parts of his case, justice is
satisfied; and even if the decision of the Circuit Court has
been made final, no denial of justice can be imputed to our
government ; much less can the imputation be fairly made,
because the law directs that, in case of appeal, part shall be
decided by one tribunal and part by another, - the facts by the
court below, and the law by this court. Such a distribution
of jurisdiction has long been established in England."
This was the beginning of the rule, which has always been
acted on since, that while the appellate power of this court
under the Constitution extends to all cases within the judicial
power of the United States, actual jurisdiction under the power
is confined within such limits as Congress sees fit to prescribe.
As was said by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Drousseau v.
United States (6 Cranch, 307, 314), " The appellate powers of
this court are not given by the judicial act. They are given
by the Constitution. But they are limited and regulated by the
judicial act, and by such other acts as have been passed on
VoL. XV.

the subject." The language of the Constitution is that " the
Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law
and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as
Congress shall make." Undoubtedly, if Congress should give
an appeal in admiralty causes, and say no more, the facts, as well
as the law, would be subjected to review and retrial; but the
power to except from -take out of- the jurisdiction, both as
to law and fact, clearly implies a power to limit the effect of
an appeal to a review of the law as applicable to facts finally
determined below. Appellate jurisdiction is invoked as well
through the instrumentality of writs of error as of appeals.
Whether the one form of proceeding is to be used or another
depends ordinarily on the character of the suit below; but the
one as well as the other brings into action the appellate powers
of the court whose jurisdiction is reached by what is done.
What those powers shall be, and to what extent they shall be
exercised, are, and always have been, proper subjects of legislative control. Authority to limit the jurisdiction necessarily
carries with it authority to limit the use of the jurisdiction.
Not only may whole classes of cases be kept out of the jurisdiction altogether, but particular classes of questions may be
subjected to re-examination and review, while others are not.
To our minds it fis no more unconstitutional to provide that
issues of fact shall not be retried in any case, than that neither
issues of law nor fact shall be retried in cases where the
value of the matter in dispute is less than $5,000. The
general power to regulate implies power to regulate in all
things. The whole of a civil law appeal may be given, or a
part. The constitutional requirements are all satisfied if one
opportunity is had for the trial of all parts of a case. Everything beyond that is matter of legislative discretion, not of
constitutional right. The Constitution prohibits a retrial of
the facts in suits at common law where one trial has been had
by a jury (Amendment, art. 7) ; but in suits in equity or in
admiralty Congress is left free to make such exceptions and
regulations in respect to retrials as on the whole may seem
best.
We conclude, therefore, that the act of Feb. 16, 1875, c. 77,
is constitutional, and that under the rule laid down in The

Oct. 1881.1

THE

"

FUANCIS WRIGHT."

Abbotsford (98 U. S. 440), and uniformly followed since, our
inquiries are confined to questions of law arising on the record,
and to such rulings, excepted to at the time, as may be presented by a bill of exceptions prepared as in actions at law.
2. As to the questions arising on the bill of exceptions.
It is undoubtedly true that if the Circuit Court neglects or
refuses, on request, to make a finding one way or the other on
a question of fact material to the determination of the cause,
when evidence has been adduced on the subject, an exception
to such refusal taken in time and properly presented by a bill
of exceptions may be considered here on appeal. So, too, if
the court, against remonstrance, finds a material act which is
not supported by any evidence whatever, an exception is taken,
a bill of exceptions may be used to bring np for review the
ruling in that particular. In the one case the refusal to find
would be equivalent to a ruling that the fact was immaterial ;
and in the other, that there was some evidence to prove what
is found when in truth there was none. Both these are questions of law, and proper subjects for review in an appellate
court. But this rule does not apply to mere incidental facts,
which only amount to evidence bearing upon the ultimate
facts of the case. Questions depending on the weight of evidence are, under the law as it now stands, to be conclusively
settled below and the fact in respect to which such an exception may be taken must be one of the material and ultimate
facts on which the correct determination of the cause depends.
In the present case the ultimate fact to be determined was
whether the loss for which the suit was brought happened because of the insufficient refrigerating apparatus, or the unseaworthiness of the vessel.

It is found in express terms that the

loss was " caused by the defective construction and working
of the refrigerating room and apparatus connected therewith,
either from inherent defects in said apparatus, or from not
using a sufficient quantity of ice, and not by any fault of the
claimants." As to this both the Circuit and District Courts
agree. This fact being established, it was unimportant to
inquire whether the vessel was seaworthy or not. If the unseaworthiness was not the proximate cause of the loss, it is not
contended the vessel can be charged with the damages.

THE "FRANCIS

WRIGHT."

[Sup. Ct.

But if it be conceded that the case depended on the seaworthiness of the vessel, we think the exceptions which have
been taken cannot be considered here. The only unseaworthiness alleged was in respect to the boiler, and as to this the
court has found that the boiler was a tubular one; that tubular
boilers are liable to leakage in the tubes; that such leakage
does not necessarily interfere with the .capacity or fitness of
the boiler for the purposes of navigation ; that this particular
boiler had one hundred and forty-four tubes ; that some of
these tubes gave out from time to time and were plugged
up; that when the vessel arrived at Philadelphia at the end
of her voyage, twenty-six of the tubes, had been plugged
up, but that the boiler was still efficient and seaworthy.
It was -also found that the voyage from Galveston to Philadelphia was two days longer than was usually occupied by
well-equipped steamers, and that the vessel put back for
repairs, by which an additional week's time was lost at
Galveston.
The complaint now made is, that the court refused to state
in its findings that there was leakage in the tubes and stoppage for repairs while the vessel was on her voyage from Philadelphia to Galveston, and while she was lying in the harbor
at Galveston taking in her cargo, and that when the vessel put
back to Galveston the engineer had not sufficient tools with
which to make his repairs. All these are mere incidental
facts, proper for the consideration of the court in determining
whether the boiler and the vessel were actually seaworthy or
not. It is not pretended that the question at issue was to be
determined alone by the probative effect of these circumstances. They were part only of the evidence on which the
ultimate finding depended, and occupy in the case the position
of testimony rather than of the facts to which the law is to be
applied by the judguient of the court. The refusal of the court
to put such statements into the record, even though established
by uncontradicted evidence, cannot properly be brought here
by a bill of exceptions, unless it also appears that the deterniination of the ultimate fact to be ascertained depended alone
upon the legal effect as evidence of the facts stated. Such,
clearly, is not this case.

get. 1881.]

THE " FRANCIS WRIGHT."

There is another equally fatal objection to this bill of exceptions. An evident effort has been made here, as it has been
before, to so frame the exceptions as, if possible, to secure a reexamination of the facts in this court. The transcript which
has been sent up contains the pleadings and all the testimony
used on the trial below. The bill of exceptions sets forth that
at the trial the pleadings were read by the respective parties, and
the testimony then put in on both sides. This being done, the
libellants presented to the court certain requests for findings of
fact and of law. These requests were numbered consecutively,
sixteen relating to facts and three to the law. Afterwards,
six additional requests for findings of fact were presented. It
is then stated that the court made its findings of fact and of
law and filed them with the clerk, together with an opinion
in writing of the circuit justice who heard the cause. The
libellants then filed what are termed exceptions to the findings
and the refusals to find. In this way exceptions were taken
separately to each and every one of the facts found and the
coniclusions of law, and to the refusal to find in accordance with
each and every one of the requests made. The grounds of the
exceptions are not stated. Many of the requests of the libellants are covered explicitly by the findings as actually made,
some being granted and others refused.
We have no hesitation in saying that this is not a proper
way of preparing a bill of exceptions to present to this court
for review rulings of the Circuit Court such as are now complained of. A bill of exceptions must be " prepared as in
actions at law," where it is used, "not to draw the whole
matter into examination again," but only separate and distinct points, and those of law. Bac. Abr., Bill of Exceptions
1 Saund. P1. & Ev. 846. Every bill of exceptions must state
and point out distinctly the errors of which complaint is made.
It ought also to show the grounds relied on to sustain the objection presented, so that it may appear the court below was
properly informed as to the point to be decided. It is needless
to say that this bill of exceptions meets none of these requirements. From anything which is here presented no judge
would be presumed to understand that the specific objection
made to any one of his findings was that no evidence what-

THE "FRANCIS

WRIGHT."

[Sup. Ct.

ever had been introduced to prove it, 6r to one of his refusals,
that the fact refused was material and had been conclusively
shown by uncontradicted testimony. No ground whatever iR
stated for any one of all the exceptions that have been taken.
To entitle the appellants to be heard here upon any such objections as they now make to the findings, they should have
stated to the court that they considered the facts refused
material to the determination of the cause, and that such
facts were conclusively proven by uncontradicted evidence.
Under such circumstances it might have been permissible
to except to the refusal and present the exception by a bill
of exceptions, which should contain so much of the testimony
as was necessary to show that the fact as claimed had been
conclusively proven. And so if the exception is as to facts
that are found, it should be stated that it was because there
was no evidence to support them, and then so much of the
testimony as was necessary to establish this ground of complaint, which might under some circumstances include the
whole, should be incorporated into the bill of exceptions. In
this way the court below would be fairly advised of the nature
of the complaint that was made in time to correct its error, if
satisfied one had been committed, or to put into the bill of
exceptions all it considered material for the support of the
rulings.
From this it is apparent we cannot on this appeal consider
any of the rulings below which have been presented by the
bill of exceptions.
3. As to the sufficiency of the facts found to support the
decree.
Upon this branch of the case we have had no more difficulty
than upon the others. The case made may be generally stated
as follows : The libellants, being about to engage in the business of
transporting fresh beef by the use of a newly patented process, applied to the claimants for a charter of their steamer for
six months, to be put into that trade. The claimants knew
for what business the vessel was engaged, and the libellants
knew that she was furnished with a tubular boiler. Such
boilers are liable to leak, but that does not necessarily interfere

Oct. 1881.]

ToE " FRANCIS WRIGHT."

with their capacity or fitness for the purposes of navigation.
The charter-party contained this clause : " First, The said party of the first part agrees the said vessel,
in and during the said voyage, shall be kept tight, stanch,
well fitted, tackled, and provided with every requisite for such
a voyage."

The charter-party makes no mention of the special business
in which the vessel was to be engaged. She was chartered
generally for six months to run between Philadelphia and New
York and Galveston, or any intermediate safe port in the
United States, or any foreign port not prohibited by the insurance. The only complaint made as to her seaworthiness, is in
respect to her boiler, and about this it is found that though to
some extent leaking, as boilers of that class are liable to be, it
was still efficient and seaworthy. The libellants fitted the
vessel with the necessary apparatus for the use of their patented process, and with a full knowledge that her boiler was
apt to leak, put a cargo of fresh beef on board to be taken
from Galveston to Philadelphia. The vessel was twenty-three
days in making that voyage instead of fourteen, which was the
usual time of well-equipped steamers. The beef was spoiled
before it got to Philadelphia, but it is expressly found that
this was because of the defective construction and working of
the refrigerating room, and the apparatus and machinery connected therewith, for which the claimants were in no respect
responsible.
Upon these facts the court below dismissed the libel, which
we think was clearly right. That the vessel was in fact seaworthy is settled by the findings. All the claimants covenanted for was, that she was provided with every requisite for
safe navigation. While they knew that her charterers intended to use her in connection with their contemplated business, it is neither found nor insisted that any higher degree of
seaworthiness was required for that kind of transportation
than any other, much less that the claimants knew it. Under
these circumstances the language of the charter-party is to be
construed only as an agreement that the vessel was seaworthy

for the purpose of navigating such a voyage as she was chartered to make, without any regard to what she was to carry.

Tnmi

"1FRANCIS WRIGH"[.p

t
[Slip. Ct.

The claimants did not contract that their vessel was in a condition to make her voyages in any particular time, but only to
make them safely. They were not applied to for a vessel
suitable for carrying fresh beef, but for one suitable for navigation generally between the designated ports and places.
Such a vessel according to the findings they got. It was their
fault alone if they did not apply for what they wanted. They
took all the risks of the undertaking, except such as arose from
the general unseaworthiness of the vessel when she was delivered into their possession, for after they got her she was to be
subject to their entire control within the terms of the charter.
If repairs were necessary to keep her in a seaworthy condition,
while under the charter the claimants might be chargeable
with the expense 6f making them, it would be the duty of the
charterers to see that they were made, or to notify the claimants of what was required. The provision that the claimants
were to nominate and the charterers appoint the engineer, and
that the appointment of the captain by the charterers should
be subject to the approval of the claimants, did not affect the
relation of the parties in this particular. Delays growing out
of derangement in the machinery were to be deducted from
the charter time, and the pay for the use of the vessel correspondingly reduced, but beyond that the owners were not to
be bound if the vessel was actually seaworthy when delivered
into the possession of the charterers under the charter.
Affirmed.
