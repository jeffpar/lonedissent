opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Nelson in Stephens v. Cdy,
of the soundness of which we entertain no doubt.
The clause of the decree below, appointing a trustee to execute an assignment if the patentee should not himself execute
one as directed by the decree, has not been objected to in argu-

ment, and was clearly within the chancery powers of the court
as defined in the statute of Maryland of 1785, which is in force

in the District of Columbia. Maryland Stat., 1785, c. 72, sects.

RIVES V. DUKr.
On the 5th of December, 1863, after the Proclamation of Emancipation, and in
that part of Virginia the people of which were in rebellion against the United
States, one resident therein sold and delivered to another a number of slaves,
with warranty of title, but not of soundness, the purchaser covenanting "to
pay on delivery the sum of $25,000 in bankable Confederate currency, and,
in addition, to give his note," with two persons named as sureties, "for the
further sum of $20,000, to be paid in twelve months after call, in equal annual payments thereafter, or at the purchaser's option it may be, on call, all
or a part paid; " and the seller covenanting "not to call upon the purchaser
for specie when it is at a premium, but engaging on his part to be satisfied
with the bankable currency of the day, on the stipulation to choose his own
time for the call." On the 1st of January, 1864, the purchaser, in lieu of the
note, made to the seller two bonds, with the same persons as sureties, to pay
$8,000 "on demand, or twelve months thereafter, at the option of the obligors," and $12,000 "on demand, or two years thereafter, at the option of
the obligors," "in the bankable currency of the day, according to the agreement of the 5th of December last," "the said demand shall be made in writing
by the obligee, his heirs or legal representatives only." Payment of the bonds
was demanded in writing by the obligee after the end of the war of the rebellion, and when the bankable currency of Virginia consisted wholly of notes
of the United States or of the national banks. Held, in an action on the
bonds, that the plaintiff had no ground of exception, 1, to the admission of
evidence that, at the time when the agreement and bonds were made, Confederate currency was bankable and was the only currency in circulation
in Virginia, the value of gold in relation to such currency was as nineteen or
twenty to one, slaves were not selling at all for gold, and these slaves were
not worth in Confederate currency so much as $45,000, and that before the
war, when the price of slaves was at its highest, such a lot of slaves wonld
not have been worth more than a fifth of that sum in gold; 2, to an instruec-

tion to the jury that, if they found that the bonds were made in reference
to Confederate currency, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the amount,
therein stipulated to be paid, at the value of Confederate money compared
with national currency at the time of the making of the bonds.

E nion to the Circuit Court of the Un ited States for the
Western District of Virginia.
This was an action of covenant, brought by the executor of
the will, and prosecuted by the administrator de bonis ton of
George Rives, against Duke, the addministrator of the estate
of William P. Farish, a surety on two bonds.
The declaration alleged that on the 5th of December, 1863,
in the county of Albemarle and State of Virginia, George
Rives and George L. Peyton executed an agreement under seal,
which began with a "list of servants sold to George L. Peyton"
(giving the names and ages of thirty-three negroes, the oldest
of whom were fifty-one years of age, and the youngest were
infants), and the rest of which was as follows: " I have this
day contracted to sell and deliver on the place, on the 1st of
January next, to George L. Peyton the above list of negroes,
thirty-three in number. The title thereto I warrant, but make
no warranty of soundness. For the same negroes the said
George L. Peyton agrees to pay on delivery the sum of
twenty-five thousand dollars in bankable Confederate curency, and in addition to give his note, with William P. Farish and William II. Peyton as sureties, for the further sum
of twenty thousand dollars, to be paid in twelve months
after call, in equal annual payments thereafter, or at said
Peyton's option it may be, on call, all or a part paid. The
said George Rives covenants le will not call on said Peyton for specie when it is at a premium, but engaging on his
part to be satisfied with the bankable currency of the day, on
the stipulation to choose his own time for the call. The said
postponed payment to carry interest from 1st January next,
and to be annually paid at Monticello Bank. The said George
Rives farther engages to furnish said Peyton one hundred barrels of corn at $20 per barrel, to be delivered on the place as
soon as gathered, and the money therefor to be paid down
in Confederate bankable currency. In witness whereof, and
mutual obligation to perform our respective engagements, we

RIVES v. DUKE.

[Sup, Ct.

this day, 5th of December, 1863, have signed our hands and
seals."
The declaration then alleged that on the 1st of January,
1864, in pursuance, of that agreement, Rives delivered the
negroes to Peyton on the farm in Albemarle on which Rives
then resided, which was " the place" referred to in the agreement, and also delivered the one hundred barrels of corn; and
Peyton paid to Rives in bankable Confederate currency ,$25,000
in part payment of the purchase-money contracted to be paid
for the slaves, and gave to Rives his two bonds, executed by
William P. Farish and William 1-. Peyton as sureties, amounting in the aggregate to $20,000, the first of which bonds was
in these terms: "1On demand, or twelve months thereafter, at
the option of the obligors, we promise to pay in the bankable
currency of the day (according to agreement of the 5th December last), to George Rives, his heirs or assigns, eight thousand
dollars with interest from date, to be annually paid on 1st January at Monticello Bank, Charlottesville; the same being in
part of the purchase-money for thirty-three negroes, the title
whereof is warranted, but no warranty is made of soundness.
The said demand shall be made in writing by said George Rives,
his assigns or legal representatives only. In witness whereof, we
have hereto put our hands and seals this first day of January,
1864 ; " and the other bond was precisely like the first, except
in substituting the words " two years " for " twelve months,"
and "twelve thousand " for "eight thousand ; " and that these
bonds were delivered and accepted as a compliance on the part
of Peyton with the provision in the previous agreement to give
his note for $20,000.
The declaration further alleged that in August, 1866, before
the institution of this suit, Rives demanded in writing of the
obligors payment of the principal and arrears of interest of the
bonds; and that, with the exception of the interest for one
year, which fell due on the 1st of January, 1865, and which
was paid, no part of the principal or interest had been paid.
The defendant demurred generally to the declaration, and
pleaded covenants performed and covenants not broken, and
twenty-five special pleas, which set forth at length, and in
various forms, that the bonds were executed in consideration

RIVES v. DUKE.

of part of the price of thirty-three negroes which Rives agreed
to sell and did sell and deliver to Peyton, with warranty of
title as slaves, after the Proclamation of Emancipation issued
by the President of the United States on the 1st of January,
1863, and from that date until after the sale and delivery of the
negroes both Rives and Peyton were participants in the then
existing rebellion against the United States, and they and the
negroes were residents of Albemarle County in the State of
Virginia, which were designated in the proclamation among
the States and parts of States the people of which were in
rebellion against the United States, and the negroes were there
held as slaves, and were by the proclamation ordered and
declared to be thenceforward free, and therefore, at the time
of the contract, sale, and delivery, were free persons ; that
before the demand of payment, or the institution of this suit,
and by action of the sovereign authority and government of
the United States and of the State of Virginia, and by the
amendments of the Constitutions of the United States and of
the State of Virginia, slavery in Virginia had been abolished,
and these negroes had been made, recognized, and declared to
be free persons; that afterwards Peyton, in pursuance of the
proclamation, was, by the authority and power of the executive government of the United States, including the military
and naval authorities thereof, wholly deprived of these negroes ; that by reason of the premises the warranty of title
was broken, and the consideration of the bonds failed; that
the contract, sale, and delivery were in direct contravention of
the policy of the government of the United States, as manifested by the proclamation, and it had become unlawful to
make or to enforce "in the courts of the. United States, or of
the State of Virginia, any contract of the plaintiff's testator
whereby these negroes had been or were treated or dealt with
otherwise than as free persons; that the plaintiff's testator,
being one of the persons included in the offer of amnesty and
pardon contained in the proclamations of the President of the
8th of December, 1863, and the 29th of May, 1865, had accepted the same upon the terms and conditions therein set
forth, and had taken the oaths therein prescribed, and had
also received from the President a special pardon upon the

IRivEs v. DUKE.

[Sup. Ct.

same conditions; and that upon each of these grounds the
plaintiff could not maintain this action.
The defendant also filed a notice "that on the trial of this
cause lie will insist upon his right to have the bonds sued upon
scaled according to the provisions of chapter 138 of the Code
of Virginia (edition of 1873) as bonds which were either,
according to the true understanding and agreement of the parties, to be fulfilled or performed in Confederate State treasury
notes, or were entered into with reference to such notes as a
standard of value."
The plaintiff joined issue on the first and second pleas, and
demurred to the twenty-five special pleas. The court overruled
the denmurrer to the declaration, and sustained the demurrers to
the special pleas.
At the trial of the issues of fact the plaintiff introduced evidence tending to prove the allegations of the declaration, and
that at and ever since the date of the demand in writing, in
August, 1866, the bankable currency of Virginia consisted
wholly of United States notes commonly called greenbacks and
of national bank notes, which have always been of about equal
value in their relations to gold.
The defendant offered evidence tending to prove the following facts: " 1. That Confederate currency was the only currency in circulation in Virginia in December, 1863, or January,
1864. 2. That in December, 1863, the value of gold in relation to such currency was as 20 to 1, and in January, 1864, as
19 to 1. 3. That of the thirty-three slaves sold by George
lives to George L. Peyton, one woman and her two children
were scrofulous, and another -woman a cripple ; and that in
December, 1863, and January, 1864, the said thir'ty-three slaves
were not worth in Richmond, Virginia, in Confederate currency,
as much as $45,000; and that they were worth less in Albemarle, where they were sold, than in Richmond. 4. That such
a lot of slaves, before the late war, even when the price of
slaves was at its highest, would not have been worth more
than $8,000 or $9,000. 5. That in December, 1863, and in
January, 1864, all Confederate currency in circulation was
bankable. 6. That as early as the fall of 1863 there was a general expectation among the people of Virginia that the ConfedeI

Oct. 1881.]

OIVEs v. DUKE.

rate Congress would adopt measures to reduce the volume of
Confederate money, and that the value of such money would be
thereby much increased. 7. That in point of fact the Confederate Congress, in February, 1864, did pass a law taxing to the
extent of 33 per cent all Confederate currency which should
not be invested in 4 per cent Confederate bonds, on or before
the 1st of April, 1864; the effect of which law was to depreciate
still further the value of Confederate currency then in circulation; and that after the 1st of April, 1864, the Confederate
money issued prior thereto ceased to be bankable. 8. That in
December, 1863, and January, 1864, slaves were not being sold
at all for gold. 9. That about the same time Tucker Coles, of
Albemarle, living five or six miles from George Rives, owned
about two hundred slaves, mechanics and field hands, and averaging in value better than the slaves of George lives ; that lie
tried to sell a large nuniber of said slaves at $50 a head, in gold,
but could not ; and that he would have sold them at $30 a head,
in gold, had it been offered to him. 10. That all of the slaves
purchased of George ives by George L. Peyton perished as
property on his hands at the close of the war. 11. That in
August, 1866, the premium on gold as compared with national
currency was 49 per cent; in August, 1867, it was 41 per cent;
and in August, 1868, 45 per cent; and that at this time such
premium is only 2 of 1 per cent.'.'

To the introduction of each and every part of this evidence
the plaintiff objected, and moved the court to exclude the
same: "1st, Because the contract sued upon is in writing, and
its meaning free from ambiguity, obscurity, or uncertainty of
any kind, and cannot therefore be explained, added to, or in
any manner varied by parol evidence. 2d, Because the evidence offered does not come within the scope or meaning of the
statute of Virginia in reference to Confederate contracts, which
was intended to apply only to contracts for the payment of
dollars in general, and not to those in which the kind of dollars
is specifically expressed, or becomes certain by some event or
contingency mentioned in the contract. 3d, Because if, accord-

ing to the true interpretation of the Virginia statute just referred to, it makes parol testimony admissible to explain, add
to, or in any manner vary a contract in writing entered into

138

RiVws v. DUKE.

[Sup. Ct.

prior to its enactment, and which is in no way ambiguous or
uncertain, then the statute is a violation of the Federal Constitution, because it not only impairs but destroys the obligation
of the contract, making a new one in its stead. 4th, Because the evidence is irrelevant, since if all the facts which
it legitimately tends to prove were admitted they would show
no defence."
But the court overruled the plaintiff's objections, and adinitted the evidence, and to the ruling admitting it the plaintiff excepted.
The plaintiff asked the court to instruct the jury as follows:
"Tirst, If they find that the contract in writing between
George Rives and George L. Peyton, dated the 5th of December, 1863, and given in evidence by the plaintiff, is the
contract referred to in the bonds sued on, then the contract
and bonds are to be construed together, and, so construed, they
import in themselves, not a contract to be paid absolutely in
Confederate money, or any other specific currency, but a contract of hazard, that is to say, a contract payable in whatever
currency should be bankable at the respective dates when the
obligors were bound to pay said bonds, that is to say, on the
30th of August, 1867, as to the smaller bond, and the 30th of
August, 1868, as to the larger bond.

Second, If the jury find

that the contract of the 5th of December, 1863, and two bonds
of the 1st of January, 1864, given in evidence by the plaintiff,
contain the true understanding and agreement of the parties as
to the currency in which said bonds were to be paid ; that more
than two years before the institution of this suit George Rives
demanded payment of said bonds of each of the obligors therein,
and in the mode agreed upon ; that at the time of said deinand, and ever since, bankable currency in Charlottesville and
throughout Virginia consisted wholly of national bank notes

and greenback notes of the United States government, and
that these have always been equal in their relation to gold, then the jury must find for the plaintiff the face amount of the
bonds, less the one year's interest credited thereon. Third,
there is no evidence in the case to warrant the jury in finding
that there was any other agreement or understanding between
the parties, as to the kind of currency in which the bonds were

Oct. 1881.]

RIVES v. DUKE.

to be paid, than that which is contained in the written contract
and bonds themselves."
But the court refused to give the instructions requested, or
either of them, and instructed the jury as follows: " If the jury
find from the evidence that George Rives and George L. Peyton, on the 5th of December, 1863, entered into the agreement
offered in evidence, and in pursuance thereof, and in accordance with its terms, Rives delivered the negroes to Peyton, and
the bonds sued on were given, on which the defendant's intestate was surety, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover the
amount stipulated to be paid in said writings obligatory in the
currency of the United States at its value at the time the same
fell due according to their tenor and effect, unless the jury find,
from the evidence in the cause, that the said writings obligatory were at the time made and understood by the parties
thereto to be made payable in Confederate money. And if
the jury find from the evidence that the said bonds or writings
obligatory were made in reference to Confederate currency,
then the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount stipulated
to be paid in such bonds, at the value of Confederate money
compared with national currency at the time of the making
thereof, with interest from the time said bonds according to
their tenor and effect became payable. But if the jury find
from the evidence that the bonds and contract offered in evidence were made in view of the uncertainty of the value of the
then or future bankable currency of the place of payment, and
that each party, in entering into the contract, took the risk of
what money should be current at the time for payment of said
bonds according to the tenor and effect thereof, then the plaintiff, if the jury find that the parties executed the contract
offered in evidence, and the bonds offered in proof in pursuance thereof, is entitled to recover the sun nominated in said
bonds in national currency at the time the same became due,
with interest thereon."
The plaintiff excepted to the refusal to give the instructions
requested, and to the instructions given, upon the same grounds
on which he had objected to the admission of the evidence
offered by the defendant.
The jury, by their verdict, " find for the plaintiff on the

RIVES v. DuiE.

[Sup. Ct.

issues joined, and assess his damages at $1,000, with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum from the 1st of
January, 1865, till paid, that being the scaled value as of the
1st of January, 1864, of the nominal amount of the bonds
sued on, less the one year's interest thereon; " and the court
gave judgment for the plaintiff accordingly. He thereupon
sued out the writ of error.
Mr. E. R. Watson and Mr. William W. Crump for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. S. V. Southall and Mr. William J. Robertson for the
defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE GRAY delivered the opinion of the court.

It is settled by the decisions of this court that a contract,
made within the so-called Confederate States during the war of
the rebellion, to pay a certain sum in dollars, without specifying the kind of currency in which it was to be paid, may be
shown, by the nature of the transaction and the attendant circumstances, as well as by the language of the contract itself,
to have contemplated payment in Confederate currency ; and
that if that fact is shown, in a-n action upon the contract, no
more can be recovered than the value of that currency in lawful
money of the United States. Tlhorington v. Sotit/, 8 Wall. 1;
The Confederate Note Case, 19 id. 548, 559; Wilmington
Weldon Railroad Co. v. K1ing, 91 U. S. 3.
By the bonds in suit the obligors promise to pay "on demand, or " (in the first bond) " twelve months," and (in the
second bond) " two years thereafter, at the option of the obligors," eight thousand and twelve thousand dollars respectively, "in the bankable currency of the day, according to the
agreement of the 5th December last." In the agreement so
referred to, which is a contract for the sale of slaves, that part
of the price which is to be paid on the delivery is clearly
expressed to be "the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars in
bankable Confederate currency; " and the agreement, upon its
face, affords strong ground for inferring that " the further
sum of twenty thousand dollars to be paid in twelve months
after call," and as to which the seller covenants not to call for
specie, but to be satisfied with the "bankable currency of the

Oct. 1881.]

RIVes v. DUtiE.

day," is also to be paid in Confederate currency, and that the
effect of this clause is not varied by the omission to repeat
therein the word " Confederate," the use of which, in the previous as well as in the subsequent part of the agreement, shows
the kind of bankable currency which the parties to the agreement, and to the bonds that refer to it, had in mind. And a
consideration of the nature of the agreement, and of the circumstances under which it was made, removes all doubt upon
the subject.
It was a contract for the sale and purchase of slaves, made
and to be performed in, between parties residing in, that part
of the State of Virginia from which the authority of the national government was excluded by the rebel armies, and was
made after the Proclamation of Emancipation issued by the
President of the United States had declared all slaves in that
district to be free. If the so-called Confederate States should
achieve independence, the money of the United States would
be the money of a foreign country. If the national authority
should be re-established over the insurgent districts, the slaves,
for part of the price of which the payment was to be made,
would be free, in fact and in law, and be wholly lost to the
purchaser. In view of either alternative, the parties caniot
reasonably be held to have contemplated payment in any other
currency than that of. the Confederate States.
That part of the evidence introduced by the defendant, of
the competency of which, in the light of the decisions in
Thorington v. Smith and in The Confederate Note Case, above
cited, there can be no question, leads to the same conclusion.
It tended to prove that, at the time and place of the making
of the agreement and of the bonds, the only currency in circulation or bankable was Confederate currency, the value of
that currency in relation to gold was as one to nineteen or
twenty, slaves were not being sold at all for gold, and these
slaves were not worth more than the stipulated price computed in Confederate currency, and would never, even before
the war, have been worth more than a fifth of that price in
gold.
The competency of the evidence as to the popular expectation of an increase in the value of Confederate currency, and

RIVES V. DUKE.

[Sup. Ct.

as to the price at which another person would or could have
sold other slaves, is much more doubtful, and need not be considered, inasmuch as it was not specifically contested at the
argument, probably because its exclusion could not vary the
result, so long as the evidence which we hold to be competent
is admitted.
The facts of the case clearly distinguish it from Gavinzel v.
Crump (22 Wall. 308), and bring it within that class of cases
in which the Court of Appeals of Virginia has held contracts
made during the war to be payable in Confederate currency
only. See l' Clung v. Ervin, Hilb v. Peylton, Bowman v. MeChesney, and Calbreath v. Virginia Porcelain Co., 22 Gratt.
(Va.), 519, 550, 609, 697.
For these reasons, we are all of opinion that the parties to
the bonds in suit contemplated payment in Confederate curreney ; and it is immaterial to consider whether, by reason of
the option given to the seller in the original agreement, and to
the obligors in the subsequent bonds, the value of that currency should be estimated as of the date of the bonds, or as
of the date of the demand of payment, because the earlier
estimate, upon which the instructions of the court and the
verdict of the jury proceeded, is the more favorable to the
plaintiff.
As no error prejudicial to the plaintiff is shown in the rulings and instructions of the court, and as the defendant has
not and could not have brought a writ of error, it would be
extra-judicial to pass upon the further position of the defendant, that the bonds sued on have no legal validity or effect.
Judgment affirmed.
