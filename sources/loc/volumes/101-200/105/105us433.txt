RUSSELL V. FArLEY.
1. Where an injunction is granted to a party without requiring him to give bond
or other undertaking, the Circuit Court has no power to award damages to
the injured party, except by such a decree in the matter of costs as may be
deemed equitable.
2. In the absence of either an act of Congress, or a rule of court on the subject,
the Circuit Court can, before granting an injunction, impose terms, and it
can relieve therefrom whenever it would be oppressive or inequitable to
continue them.
3. Where neither the bond given, nor te statutes, nor any rule of court, prescribes
a specific mode of assessing damages, and time condition of the bond is simply
to pay such as the adverse party may sustain by reason of the injunction,
if the court finally decides that theparty to whom it was granted is not
entitled thereto,- Semble, that the court may, as an incident to its jurisdiction, cause them to be assessed under its own direction, or leave the party
to his action at law.
4. The court decreed that this was not a case for damages. Hdd, that its action
in the premises approaches so nearly to an exercise of discretion, that a very
clear showing must be made to induce this court to reverse it.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Minnesota.
The case is fully stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. Richard L. Ashurst and Mr. Thomas H. Hubbard for
the appellant.
Mr. Henry J. Iorn for the appellee.
MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This case comes before us by appeal from a decree in a case
in equity wherein Jesse P. Farley, as receiver of certain branch

lines of the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company, and of all
lands and other property appurtenant thereto, was complainant, and the firm of De Graff & Co., the Northern Pacific

Railroad Company, the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad Company, B. S. Russell, G. W. Cass, receiver of the
Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and C. W. Mead, general
manager of said company, were defendants. The complainant was appointed receiver Aug. 1, 1873, in a foreclosure suit
brought by John S. Kennedy and others, trustees under a mortgage given by the St. Paul and Pacific Rail'oad Company to
secure fifteen millions of dollars or bonds issued by a subsidiary

[Sup. Ct.

corporation called the First Division of the St. Paul and Pacific
Railroad Company, which had a contract to build the railroad,
and a lease of the road for ninety-nine years. Amongst the
assets supposed by the receiver to be subject to this mortgage
was certain railroad iron, which had been purchased in England with the money raised by the sale of the bonds, to wit,
1,700 tons lying at Glyndon, on the line of the road, and 1,000
tons at Duluth, claimed by Do Graft & Co., and 1,860 tons at
at Duluth being
Duluth, claimed by B. S. Russell, -that
mostly held in the custom-house for unpaid duties, but some of
it being about to be reshipped. The bill in this case was filed
by the receiver in the State District Court for the county of'
Ramsey on the 21st of June, 1875, seeking to set aside the
respective transfers of iron by virtue of which De Graft & Co.
and Russell claimed to hold it, and for an injunction to restrain
them from removing it, or taking it from the custom-house.
By a statute of Minnesota it is declared that, " when no
special provision is made by law as to security upon injunction,
the court or judge allowing the writ shall require a bond on
behalf of the party applying for such writ, in a sum not less
than two hundred and fifty dollars, executed by him or some
person for him, as principal, together with one or more sufficient sureties, to be approved by said court or judge, to the
effect that the party applying for the writ will pay the party
enjoined or detained such dainages as lie sustains by reason
of the writ, if the court finally decide that the party was not
entitled thereto. The damages may be ascertained by a reference or otherwise as the court shall direct.'" 2 Bisseli's Statutes, 806, sect. 121.
On filing the bill in this cause,, the complainant (the said
receiver) obtained a temporary injunction upon giving to the
defendants a bond in the penalty of $10,000, with the following condition, to wit: - Whereas the said plaintiff is about to
apply to this court for a temporary injunction enjoining and
restraining the defendants, and each of them, from shipping,
removing, selling, hypothecatin g, transporting, interfering, or
intermeddling with 4,560 tons of iron rails now lying at
Glyndon and Duluth, Minnesota, or any part thereof: Now,
therefore, if the plaintiff will pay the parties enjoined by such

RUSSELL V. FARLE;Y.

writ, or detained thereby, such damages as they or either or
any of them may sustain by reason of the writ, if the court
finally decide that the party was not entitled thereto, the above
obligation shall be void, else of full force and virtue."
De Graff & Co. having by consent rebonded 1,000 tons of
the iron claimed by them, the court, on the 11th of August,
1875, required a further bond from the complainant in the sum
of $79,000, the condition of which was as follows, to wit:
"Whereas an injunction has heretofore been granted in this
court enjoining and restraining the said defendants, and each
of them, from shipping, removing, selling, hypothecating, transferring, or interfering, or intermeddling with 4,500 tons of iron
rails now lying at Glyndon and Duluth, Minnesota, or an y
part thereof ; and whereas said injunction is still in force
and effect except as to one thousand tons of said iron, claimed by
said De Graft & Co., at Dulutli, aforesaid ; and whereas the
said court has ordered, as a condition for the continuance of said
injunction, that the plaintiff execute to the defendants herein
a bond in the sum of seventy-nine thousand dollars, in addition
to the bond for ten thousand dollars heretofore given by the
plaintiff on the issuance of the injunction: Now, therefore, if
the plaintiff will pay the parties enjoined by such injunction,
or detained thereby, such damages as they, or either or any of
them, may sustain by reason of such injunction, if tile court
finally decide that the party was not entitled thereto, the above
obligation shall be void, else of full force and virtue."
The defendants severally answered the bill, and on the 1st
of March, 1876, on application of the complainant, the cause
was removed to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Minnesota. After taking a large amount of evidence, it was brought to a hearing, and on the 13th of' October,
1877, a final decree was made dismissing the bill as to Do Graft
& Co., without costs to either party. As to the defendant Russell, who was charged with holding 1,860 tons of the iron, itappeared that he was acting as agent for William G. Morehead,
who was trustee or agent for the First Division Company in
procuring the iron and carrying on the work of construction,
and who had sold to De Graft & Co., sub-contractors, the iron
claimed by them, in part payment of moneys due them for

RUSSELL V. FARLEY.

[Sup. Ct.

work; and had pledged a portion of the 1,860 tons of iron
(claimed by Russell) to pay Jay Cooke & Co., for advances of
money, and Jay Cooke & Co. had pledged and sold it to the
United States (the Navy Department) for a debt due to it.
Some 1,090 tons of the 1,860 tons in question remained at Duluth unsold, and this was claimed by. Edward M. Lewis, trustee
in bankruptcy of Morehead; but the court held that it was
subject to the mortgage, and that the receiver was entitled
to it. The decree on, this part of the case was as follows, to
wit: " It is also further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the
said Farley, as receiver, as against the defendant B. S. Russell,
and against the defendant Edward M. Lewis, trustee in banlruptcy of William (A. Morehead and others, is entitled, for the
benefit of the trust which he represents, to all the iron rails in
controversy herein not sold to De Graff & Co., and not pledged
and sold to the Navy Department; which said iron rails, subject to the customs duties to the United States, thus decreed
to the said Farley as receiver, he is authorized to use in the
construction of the said extension lines, or to sell at the best
prices and on the best terms practicable, and apply the net proceeds thereof to the credit of the mortgage, dated April 1, 1871,
executed by the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company to
Horace Thompson, George L. Becker, and William G. Morehead, trustees, who in the said trust have been succeeded by
the said Wetmore, Pearsal, and Denny, as trustees, and which
mortgage is now being foreclosed in this court, neither party
as against the other to recover costs or damages. It is further
adjudged and decreed that all transfers of the 1,860 tons of
iron in controversy herein claimed by defendant Russell from
William G. Morehead to said Russell, except transfers relating
to the iron pledged to tie Navy Department, are null and void,
and that said Russell has no right, title, or interest therein as
against the said Farley and said trustees. It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that said Farley has no right,
title, or interest in the iron transferred to the Navy Department, and which is claimed herein by defendants Russell and
Lewis; and it is further adjudged that neither the plaintiff nor
the defendant Russell is entitled to costs or damages herein."

Oct. 1881.]

RUSSELL V. FARLEY.

Russell alone appealed from this decree, and appealed only
from that portion of it which declared that neither party as
against the other is entitled to costs or damages.
That an appeal does not lie from a decree in equity as to
the costs merely, is well settled. Canter v. Amnerican &' Ocean
Insurance 0o., 3 Pet. 307; -Elastic Fabrics Coqvpony v. Smith,
100 U. S. 110. But it is contended by the appellant that the
Circuit Court had no power to decree that he was not entitled
to damages, thereby precluding hini from recovering damages
on the injunction bond; and, if it had any power to make a
decree on the subject of damages, the decree denying him
damages in this case is erroneous.
Had the cause remained in the State court, there can be no
doubt that that court, under the Minnesota statute which required an injunction bond to be given, could have determined
the question of damages. The statute expressly declares that
"the damages may be ascertained by a reference, or otherwise,
as the court shall direct." But the Circuit Court of the United
States is not governed in its practice in equity by the laws of
the State in which it sits, but by the rules of practice prescribed
by this court and by the Circuit Court not inconsistent therewith ; and, when these are silent, by the practice of the High
Court of Chancery in England prevailing when the equity rules
were adopted, so far as the same may reasonably be applied.
The injunction bond taken by the State
Equity Rule 90.
court, it is true, comes into the Circuit Court with the other
proceedings in full force ; but the power of the Circuit Court
to deal with it depends upon the principles which govern the
practice of that court, the same as if it had been originally
taken by its direction.
The question then arises whether the Circuit Courts have
any power to make a decree on the subject of damages arising
from an injunction, where an injunction bond has been required. Where no bond or undertaking has been required, it
is clear that the court has no power to award damages sustained by either party in consequence of the litigation, except
by making such a decree in reference to the costs of the suit
as it may deem equitable and just. Has it any such power, or
any power over the subject, where such a bond has been given ?

RUSSELL v. FARLEY.

[Sup. Ct.

For a solution of this question it will be proper to advert
briefly to the history and object of this kind of obligations.
It is a settled rule of the Court of Chancery, in acting on
applications for injunctions, to regard the comparative injury
which would be sustained by the defendant, if an injunction
were granted, and by the complainant, if it were refused.
Kerr on Injunctions, 209, 210. And if the legal right is
doubtful, either in point of law or of fact, the court is always
reluctant to take a course which may result in material injury
to either party ; for the damage arising from the act of the
court itself is daninum alsque injuria, for which there is no
redress except a decree for the costs of the suit, or, in a proper
case, an action for malicious prosecution. To remedy this
difficulty, the court, in the exercise of its discretion, frequently
resorts to the expedient of imposing terms and conditions upon
the party at whose instance it proposes to act. The power to
impose such conditions is founded upon, and arises from, the
discretion which the court has in such cases, to grant, or not to
grant, the injunction applied for. It is a power inherent in
the court, as a court of equity, and has been exercised from
time immemorial. The older authorities refer to numerous
instances in which it has been exercised. Chief Baron Gilbert
in his Forum Romanmn, p. 196 (repeated in Bacon's Abridgment, title Injunction, C), speaking of the course where an
answer is put in, denying the equity of the bill, followed by a
rule nisi to dissolve the injunction, says: " The plaintiff must
show cause either upon the merits, or upon filing of exceptions ;
if upon the merits, the court may put what terms they please
upon him, as bringing in the money, or paying it to the party,
subject to the order of the court, or giving judgment with a
release of errors, and consenting to bring no writ of error, or to
give security to abide the order on hearing, or the like." See
also Newland's Ch. Pract., 223, 224; Kerr, Injunctions, 212,
622; Story, Eq. Jur., sects. 958 b,959 d. In Marquis of Downstire V. Lady Sandys (6 Ves. Jr. 107), A. D. 1801, Lord Eldon
said if there was a real doubt on the subject in controversy, he
would direct an issue, " taking care that if in the result of such
a direction the defendant should be prejudiced by not being
permitted to cut in the mean time [trees claimed to be orna-

mental], the plaintiff should undertake to pay the value if the
decision should be against him." In a similar case, in 1825,
the same judge made an order that the plaintiff should go
before the master and give such security as would in the master's judgment secure to the defendants the value of all the
trees which they should be prevented from cutting by the injunction, in case it should finally turn out in the judgment of
the court that they ought not to have been enjoined in equity.
Wornwell v. Belas se, id. 110, note.
Mr. Kerr, in his treatise on Injunctions, says: " In balancing
the comparative convenience or inconvenience from granting
or withholding an injunction, the court will take into consideration what means it has of putting the party who may be
ultimately successful in the position he would have stood if his
legal rights had not been interfered with. The court may
often by imposing terms on the one party, as the condition of
either granting or withholding the inj un.etion, secure the other
party from damage in the event of his proving ultimately to
have the legal right. . . .The defendant may be required to
do such acts, or execute such works, or otherwise deal with the
same as the court shall direct; or to enter into an undertaking
to refrain from doing in the mean time the acts complained of
by the bill, or to abide the order the court may make as to
damages or otherwise, in the event of the legal right being determined in favor of the plaintiff.... So, on the other hand,
as a condition of granting an injunction, [the court may] require the plaintiff to enter into an undertaking as to damages
in the event of the right at law being determined in favor of
tle defendant, and the injunction proving to have been wrongly
granted."
Kerr, Injunctions, 212. Again, in another place, lie
says: " In doubtful cases where damage may be occasioned to
the defendant in the event of an injunction or interim restraining order proving to have been wrongly granted, the court will
require the plaintiff, as a condition of its interference in his
favor, to enter into an undertaking to abide by any order it
may make as to damages." Kerr, 622. In Wilkins v. Ailcin (17
Ves. Jr. 422), where a bill was filed to prevent the infringement of a copyright; but it being doubtful whether the defendant did more than make allowable extracts from the plaintiff's

RUSSELL v. FARLEY.

[Sup. Ct.

work, Lord Eldon said: " The proper course in this instance
will be to permit this work to be sold in the mean time ; the
defendant undertaking to account according to the result of
the action." p. 426.
The same practice has prevailed in this country, in some
cases in pursuance of statute, and in others, by the action of
the court itself. As early as 1723 a law was passed in Maryland, that any person desiring to proceed in equity against a
verdict or judgment rendered against him in the County Court,
should be required to give security in double the amount of
the debt for the due prosecution of the injunction and payment of debt and all costs and damages that should accrue in
the Chancery Court, or should be occasioned by the delay,
unless the Court of Chancery should decree to the contrary,
and in all things obey such order and decree as the court
should make. In 1793 an additional law was passed, to the
effect that whenever application should be made for an injunction to stay proceedings at law, the Chancellor should have
power and discretion to require the applicant to give a bond to
the plaintiff at law, with condition to perform such order or
decree as the Chancellor should finally pass in the cause.
Similar laws were passed in Virginia iii 1787, and in New
Jersey in 1799, and no doubt in other States at an early date.
Their object was, where an adjudication had already been had
at law, to make it compulsory on the Chancellor to require
security before granting an injunction. The jealousy of the
courts of law at the interference of the Court of Chancery
with their judgments is a matter of historical notoriety. But
these laws did not interfere with the Chancellor's discretionary
power to require a bond in all other cases.
Regulations substantially similar to those above adverted to
were prescribed by general rule, of the Court of Chancery of
New York prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes. In
1828 they were codified, with amendments, in that revision.
But the rule, as well as the statute, only related to injunctions
for staying proceedings at law.
In 1830, the Chancellor of New York, for the first time,
made a general rule (No. 31), that where no special provision
was made by law as to security, the vice-chancellor, or master,

Oct. 1881.]

RUSSELL v. FARLEY.

who allowed an injunction out of court, should take from the
complainant, or his agent, a bond to the party enjoined, either
with or without sureties in the discretion of the officer, in
such sum as might be deemed sufficient, not less than $500,
conditioned to pay such party all damages he might sustain
by reason of such injunction if the court should decide that
the complainant was not entitled to the same ; and that the
damages might be ascertained by a reference or otherwise,
as the court should direct. 1 Hoffman, Ch. Pr. 80; 1 Barb.
Ch. Pr. 622; 2 Paige (N. Y.), 122. The object, no doubt,
was to prevent hasty and oppressive injunctions from being
issued by subordinate officers.
This rule, enlarged and made applicable to all courts and
judges, was copied in the New York Code of Procedure of
1848, sect. 195 (now sect. 222), and has been followed in other
codes and systems of practice in other States. See 2 R. S.
Wisconsin, 748; also Laws of Illinois, Iowa, Colorado, &c.
It was substantially adopted in the Chancery Rules of New
Jersey in 1853, except that it was left to the discretion of the
officer to require a bond or not. It was copied in the statutes
of Minnesota, under which the bonds in the present case were
taken, as may be seen by comparing it with the section of
said statutes already cited.
But no act of Congress or rule of this court has ever been
passed or adopted on this subject. The courts of the United
States, therefore, must still be governed in the matter by the
general principles and usages of equity. To these we have
already adverted so far as concerns the power to require security or impose terms before granting an injunction. It remains
to notice the control which a Court of Chancery may exercise
in relieving from or modifying such terms during the progress
or at the termination of the cause, and of enforcing and carrying out the conditions imposed or the undertakings entered
into.

Since the discretion of imposing terms upon a party, as a
condition of granting or withholding an injunction, is an in-

herent power of the court, exercised for the purpose of effecting justice between the parties, it would seem to follow that,
in the absence of an imperative statute to the contrary, the

RUSSELL V. FARLEY.

[Sup. Ct.

court should have the power to mitigate the terms imposed, or
to relieve from them altogether, whenever in the course of the
proceedings it appears that it would be inequitable or oppressive to continue them. Besides, the power to impose a condition implies the power to relieve from it. If, for example, it
is deemed proper, upon an application for an injunction, to
require, as a condition of granting or withholding it, that a
sun of money should be paid into court, or that a deed or
other document should be deposited with the register, and the
developments of the case are afterwards such as to make it
manifestly unjust to retain the fund or document and deprive
the owner of its use, the court assuredly has the power
(though, undoubtedly, to be exercised with caution) to order
it to be delivered out to the party. When the pledge is no
longer required for the purposes of justice, the court must have
the power to release it, and leave the parties to the ordinary
remedies given by the law to litigants inter sese. Where the
fund is security for a debt or a balance of account, or other
money demand, this would rarely be allowable; but in many
other cases it might not unfrequently occur that injustice
would result from keeping property impounded in the court.
On general principles the same reason applies where, instead
of a pledge of money or property, a party is required to give
bond to answer the damage which the adverse party may sustain by the action of the court. In the course of the cause, or
at the final hearing, it may manifestly appear that such an extraordinary security ought not to be retained as a basis of
further litigation between the parties; that the suit has been
fairly and honestly pursued or defended by the party who was
required to enter into the undertaking, and that it would be
inequitable to subject him to any other liability than that
which the law imposes in ordinary cases. In such a case it
would be a perversion, rather than a furtherance, of j ustice to
deny to the court the power to supersede the stipulation
imposed.
Against this view, however, the appellants have strenuously
urged the case of Novello v. James (5 De G., M. & G. 876), in
which an injunction against the sale of certain compositions of
Mendelssohn in violation of a copyright was obtained on an

Oct. 1881.]

RUSSELL V. FARLEY.

undertaking of the plaintiff to abide the order of the court as to
damages. After a three years' litigation the case was decided
against the plaintiff. The legal title having been a doubtful
one, the plaintiff moved that his bill might be dismissed without costs, and the defendant moved that the plaintiff might be
decreed to pay him damages sustained by reason of the injunction. The Vice-Chancellor decided that the proper damages
would be the costs of the suit. Upon appeal, this order was
reversed upon the ground that the defendant, under the circumstances, had a right to insist on having his damages ascertained either by reference to an officer of the court, or by a
trial at law. The Lords Justices thought that it would be
unjust to the defendant to disregard, or not to give effect to,
the undertaking which was the price at which the plaintiff
accepted the injunction ; and that there was not sufficient evidence before the Vice-Chancellor to enable him to decide what
the defendant's damages amounted to, or whether the costs,
supposing him not otherwise entitled to them, were a just
measure of the damages.
It is evident, from a careful reading of this case, that the
decision was based on the merits; and that the Lords Justices
were of opinion that the defendant was entitled to damages;
not as a matter of course because an undertaking had been
given, but as a matter of justice and equity, which the undertaking would enable him. to enforce. They held, therefore,
that evidence of the damages should have been taken; and
that the decree of the Vice-Chancellor was erroneous, because
made without any such evidence. We do not perceive that
this case is at all adverse to the view which we have taken.
When the court sees no just cause for superseding or suspending the effect of an injunction bond, or undertaking, it
should be enforced in pursuance of its terms ; and the party
for whose benefit it was given will be entitled to an assessment
of damages.
But then arises the question (not essential, however, to be
decided in this case), how the damages should be assessed, and
on this point different opinions have been entertained. Sometimes the form of the bond itself, or the order requiring it, or
the statute or rule of court under which it is given, prescribes

RUSSELL V. FARLEY.

[SLIP. Ct.

the mode of assessment, as by a reference, or otherwise, as the
court shall direct. This is the ordinary course in England,
and is that prescribed in Chancellor Walworth's order, which,
as before stated, is followed in several State statutes, and,
amongst others, in the statute of Minnesota. In such case no
question can arise as to the authority of the Court of Chancery
to cause the damages to be assessed under its own direction.
But where, as in the present, case, no specific provision is
made either in the bond, or by any statute or rule of court, and
the condition of the bond is simply to pay such damages as the
parties enjoined may sustain by reason of the injunction if the
court finally decide that the party was not entitled thereto,
as before stated some difference of opinion exists as to the
power of the Court of Chancery to assess the damages, and
whether the only proper method is not an action at law on the
bond. The appellants insist that the latter is the only proper
and legal course. In the ease of .Beib v. Heath (12 How. 168,
179), Mr. Chief Justice Taney made this remark: "A court
proceeding according to the rules of equity cannot give a
judgment against the obligors in an injunction bond when it
dissolves the injunction. It merely orders the dissolution,
leaving the obligee to proceed at law against the sureties, if he
sustains damage from the delay occasioned by the injunction."
In that case, an injunction bond had been given to stay proceedings on an executory process in the Circuit Court for the
District of Louisiana, and, in an action on the bond, that court
had given judgment against the sureties, not merely for the damages arising from the delay caused by the injunction, but for
the whole debt, interest and costs, in accordance with the law
of Louisiana, where injunction bonds are binding to that extent, and where judgment is usually given against the sureties
as parties to the cause, on dismissing the injunction, similar to
the proceeding against stipulators in admiralty. This court
held that the circuit courts sitting in equity could not take
such a bond, or give it such effect, and reversed the judgment.
The remark that, the bond must be prosecuted at law was a
mere passing remark; it was so prosecuted in that case; but
from the great experience of the Chief Justice, it undoubtedly expressed the prevailing practice with regard to ordinary

Oct. 188t.]

RUSSELL v. FARLEY.

injunction bonds given under the Maryland statute in cases of
injunctions to stay proceedings at law. Whether the remark
can be understood as having a wider scope is doubtful.
A decision on the point, however, was made by Mr. Justice
Curtis, on the first circuit, in the case of 1.erryfield v. Jones,
2 Curtis C. C. 306. That was a patent case in which an injunction had been issued upon condition of entering into bond to
pay the defendant any damages he might suffer by reason of
the injunction if finally determined not to be rightful. On dismissal of the bill, motion was made to refer to a master the
question of damages. Mr. Justice Curtis denied the motion,
holding that the party's remedy was an action at law, but he
only referred to the case of Bein v. Heath. The opinion is
brief, and it does not appear that the question was very fully
examined. The learned justice seemed to think that, inasmuch as the bond gave a legal action, the court sitting in
equity had no jurisdiction over the question of damages.
Other cases are referred to by the counsel of the appellants
to sustain their position ; but upon a careful examination we
are not satisfied that they furnish any good authority for disaffirming the power of the court having possession of the case,
in the absence of any statute to the contrary, to have the damages assessed under its own direction. This is the ordinary
course in the Court of Chancery in England, by whose practice
the courts of the United States are governed, and seems to be
in accordance with sound principle. The imposition of terms
and conditions upon the parties before the court is an incident
to its jurisdiction over the case ; and having possession of the
principal case, it is fitting that it should have power to dispose
of the incidents arising therein, and thus do complete justice,
and put an end to further litigation. We are inclined to think
that the court has this power ; and that it is an inherent power,
which does not depend on any provision in the bond that the
party shall abide by such order as the court may make as to
damages (which is the usual formula in England) ; nor on the
existence of an express law or rule of court (as adopted in
some of the States) that the damages may be ascertained by
reference or otherwise, as the court may direct ; this being a
mere appendage to the principal provision requiring a bond to

RUSSELL V. FARLEY.

[Sup. Ct.

be taken, and not conferring the power to take one, or to deal
with it after it has been taken. But whilst the court may
have (we do not now undertake to decide that it has) the
power to assess the damages, yet if it has that power, it is in
its discretion to exercise it, or to leave the parties to an action
at law. No doubt in many cases the latter course would be
the more suitable and convenient one.
In the present case, however, the court did not attempt to
assess any damages which the defendants may have sustained
in consequence of the injunction and proceedings in the cause,
but decreed that it was not a case for damages ; in other
words, that the bond ought not to be prosecuted. That damages were sustained is very probable. Such a litigation as this
was could hardly fail to result in damage to all the parties engaged in it. But it is generally darnmum absque injuria. The
question before the court, or at least that which it undertook
to determine, was whether, under the circumstances of the
case, any damages at all ought to be recovered. Its decision
was, that none ought to be recovered; or, in effect, that the'
bond ought not to be prosecuted. In view of what has already been said, we think that the court had power to decide
this question.
But the appellants contend that, even if the court had the
power to pass upon the question at all, its decision was erroneous, and ought to be reversed on the merits. On this point,
the judgment of the court approaches so near to an exercise of
discretion, that we should require a very clear case to be made
in order to induce us to reverse it. The conduct of the parties and the course of litigation in the court below pass so
directly under the inspection of that court, as to give it many
advantages which no other court can possess, for forming a correct decision on the question, whether any extra damages should
