instead of October 1, and possession of the road was ordered
to be surrendered to Seney as trnstee on April 6, 1886. No

APPEAL F OM THE

cOIcUIT COURT OF THl

UNITED STATES FOR

THE DISTRICT OF INDIANA.
No. 14. Argued October 13,1893.-

Decided November 20, 1893.

In 1867 B. and S. entered into a contract which was evidenced by the following writings, signed by them respectively. (1) B. to S., dated September
18: " Enclosed please find otir bill of sundry arms, etc., amounting to
$39,887.60, for which amount please give us credit on consignment account. As mutually agreed, we consign these arms to your care, to be
shipped to Mlexico and to be sold there by you to the best advantage.
Should these arms not be disposed of at the whole amount charged, we
have to bear the loss. Should there be any profit realized over the
above amount of bill, such profit shall be equally divided between yourself and us. Also, it is understood that All these goods are shipped by
you free of any expenses to us, and that in -case all or any of them
should not be sold, they shall be returned to us free of all charges. As
you have insured these goods, as well as other merchandise, we should
be pleased to have the amount of $40,000 transferred to us. Please

acknowledge the receipt of this, expressing your acquiescence in above,
and oblige." Accompanying this was an invoice headed "S. in joint
account with B." To this S. replied the same month: "I have the honor
to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th inst., in which you
enclose bill of sundry arms, amounting to .$39,887.60, consigned to me
upon certain conditions contained in said letter. In reply I have to say
that I accept the terms of said conditions of consignment, and as soon
as I obtain the policies of insurance upon said goods will transfer them
to you." In October B. wrote S.: "Enclosed we beg to hand you our
bill for muskets, amounting to 10,175, for which please give us credit
on consignment account. As mutually agreed, we consign these arms
to your care, to be shipped to Mexico, and to be sold there by you to the
best advantage. Should these arms not be disposed of at the amount
charged, we have to stand the loss. Should there be any profit realized
over the amount, such profit shall be equally divided between yourself
and us. It is also understood that these goods shall be shipped by you
free of any expenses to us, and that in case they should not find a ready
sale, they shall be returned to us free of all charges. Please attend to
the insurance of this lot and have the amount transferred to us in one
policy; also please acknowledge the receipt of this, stating your acquiescence in above." Accompanying this was an invoice headed: "S.
bought of B. in.
joint account." The goods were shipped for their destination in Mexico. S. took out policies of insurance on the SeptemberK
shipments in his own name "for account of whom it might concern,"
which policies were handed-to B. by direction of S. The October shipments reached their destination. A large part of the September shipments was lost. B. collected the insurance on such of the policies as
were in his hands. Held,
(1) That the contract was not a contract of sale of the goods by B. to
S., but a bailment upon the terms stated in the correspondence,
and as it wis clearly expressed in the writings between the parties, it could not be varied by the terms of the printed bill-head of
the invoice;
(2) That S., as bailee, was exempted by the common law from liability
for loss of the consigned goods arising from inevitable accident;
(3) That there was no undertaking in the contract on his part which
took him out of the operation of the common law rule;
(4) That the taking of the policies of insurance in his own name by S.
did not tend, under the circumstances, to establish.that he recognized his liability for thd loss of the goods, as it v..s clear that,
under a policy running to S. "for account of whom it might concerr," B. could show and recover in event of loss, his interest,
which was a substantial one;
(5) That certain statements made by S.. did not amount to an estoppel,
the rule being that a statement of opinion-upon a question of law,
where the facts are equally well known to both parties, does not
work an estoppel.

OOTOBER TERAE, 1893.
Statement of the Case.

THE

court stated the case as follows:

This suit, as originally instituted, was an action at law by
the appellant in the Superior Court of Marion County,
Indiana, against the defendants, to recover the sum of
$238,000, with interest thereon, which sum, the plaintiff
alleged, they were indebted to him. The defendants, being
citizens of New York, renfoved the cause to the Circuit Court
of the United States, and, as the claim involved various matters'of account, running through a'period of several years, the
court, on motion of the defendants, transferred the cause to
the equity docket, and required the plaintiff to reform his
-pleadings. In compliance .with this order, the plaintiff filed
his bill of complaint, setting forth various transactions involving matters of account between himself and the defendants,
commencing in September, 1867, and continuing down to
September, 1876.. The answer of the defendants admitted
many of the facts charged, and either denied others or set up
itew matter in avoidance thereof.
The several items of account presented by the pleadings
need not be specially mentioned or separately considered; nor
is it deemed necessary, in the view we entertain of the case, to
review the immense volume of testimony taken in the course
of the litigation - covering about four thousand printed pages
-involving irreconcilable conflicts, and including much that
is wholly irrelevant. The material facts are clearly established
by the written agreement of the parties, and by the admissions made in the pleadings; and the. controlling question of
law arising thereon, and upon which the correctness of the
decree dismissing the bill must be determined, is whether the
court below placed the proper construction upon the original
contract entered into between the parties, under which the
defendants consigned certain arms and munitions'of war to
the complainant, to be by him shipped to and sold in Mexico.
That contract, after some previous verbal negotiations, was
embraced in the following correspondence:

The invoice which accompanied this last consignment is as
follows:

While it is clearly established that both of these consignments were made upon the same terms and conditions, the
invoices which accompanied them differed in some respects.
.The bill accompanying the October consignment was entirely
in writing, while the invoice accompanying the September consignment was written under a printed bill-head of the, defendants. The printed heading was not changed except by erasing
the words "bought of" and inserting in their place the words
"Mr. H. Sturm in joint ace't with'." The words "payable in
gold" appear to have been stamped on the bill, but whether
this was done at the time of its delivery to the complainant
or subsequently, when the defendants regained possession of

STURMl v. BOKER.
Statement of the Case.

the bill, is a question of dispute between the parties, and under
the testimony it is a matter of grave doubt whether they
formed a part of the invoice bill as originally rendered; but
it is not deemed necessary to determine this controverted question of fact.
The October consignment, which was insured by the defendants themselves, and was shipped by the steamer Wilmington,
reached Mexico safely, and causes no controversy between the
parties except as to a portion of the proceeds arising from the
sale thereof, which was received by the defendants.
The September consignment, together with similar goods of
the value of $169,516, belonging to the complainant, were
shipped on the schooner IKeese and brig Blonde. The Blonde
carried of the consigned gdods $10,568.60, and of the complainant's goods $11,250; while the Keese carried of the consigned
goods $29,327, and of complainant's goods $152,266.
The goods shipped on both vessels were insured in fourteen
separate policies. These policies were made out in the name
of Sturm "for account of whom it might concern." The
whole amount of insurance on the goods carried by the
Blonde was $30,000, while the total insurance on the goods,
individual and consigned, carried by the Keese was $163,000.
This insurance was effected through an insurance broker, who
was informed that the. defendants had an interest of about
$40,000 in the goods to be covered by the policies, and who
was directed to consult Mt. Funke, the member of defendants'
firm with whom the complainant had chiefly conducted the
transaction in controversy, as to how these policies should be
made. This he did, and with the consent and by the direction
*of Mr. Funke he took the whole lot of insurance together, in
the name of complainant "for account of whom it might concern," and appropriated for the benefit of the defendants, and
handed over to them by the instruction of the complainant
and of Funke, four policies on the cargo of the Keese amounting to $55,000, issued respectively by the Sun, the New
York, the Orient and the Mercantile Tnsurance Companies;
and one policy'for $15,000 issued by the United States Lloyds
Insurance Company on the cargo of the Blonde. These

Statement of the Case.

four policies on the Keese together with one on the Blonde
the insurance broker selected for the defendants at their
request, as being issued by good companies, and they were
delivered to the defendants about the date of their issuance.
The policies thus delivered to them, as understood by the
broker who selected and turned them over to the defendants,
were intended to cover their interest in the insured cargoes of
the Keese and the Blonde. The amount of the policies so
delivered to defendants was in excess. of the invoice prices of
the consigned goods, for the reason, as alleged, that policies
covering the exact amount could not be selected, but with the
understanding that the excess was to be held for account of
the complainant.
The vessels carrying the cargo sailed for Mexico in Septem-her, 1867, a few days after the insurance was effected. On the
voyage the Blonde was caught in a storm, and part of her
cargo was thrown overboard to save the vessel. The insured
goods had to contribute to the general average the sum of
$1463.84, which was paid by the complainant, who also paid
out the further sum of $672.78 for repairing part of the consigned goods, which reached Mexico in a damaged condition.
-Half of the amount paid on general average, and the.amount
paid for repairs upon the consigned goods, are the only items
of account in controversy, so far as concerns the shipment
made upon the Blonde - nothing having been recovered, either
by complainants or defendants, upon the insurance policies
taken out on the cargo which she carried. That shipment, except in respect to the items paid on general average and for
repairs, may, therefore, be dropped out of further consideration.
The Keese, carrying $29,327 of the consigned goods and
$152,266 of complainant's individual goods, and covered 'by
twelve policies of insurance, amounting to $163,00, was
wrecked on her voyage without fault or negligence on the
part of complainant, and her cargo was totally lost,
The complainant had reached Havana, on his way to Mexico,
when he learned of the loss of the Keese and her cargo, and
promptly notified the defendants by telegram of the fact. The
defendants thereupon called for and received from the com-

Statement of the Case.

plainant's agent in New York- City the invoice which accompanied the consignment of September 18, 1867, for the purpose
of preparing and making proof of the loss. The insurance
companies refused to pay the policies on various grounds,
which need not -be noticed here.
The complainant returned to New York in March, 1868,
-and learning that the insurance companies contested their
liability for the loss, arranged with the defendants to institute,
suits against the companies to recover on the policies held by
them respectively. The defendants employed Mr. Da Costa
to sue upon the policies held by them, while the complainant
employed Mr. Parsons to sue upon his,'and the lawyers were
to cooperate and assist each other in the prosecution of all the
suits.
About the time this arrangement was made the complainant
opened a bank account with the defendants, and thereafter
made deposits with and drew checks and drafts upon them as
his bankers down to the latter part of 1875.
The litigation against the insurance companies continued
until September 13, 1876, when the last collection upon the
policies was made. During the progress of the litigation the
complainant turned over, or assignedi to the defendants such
juidgments as he had obtained, and such policies standing in
his name as had not been reduced to judgment, as alleged, for
the purpose of convenience in collection and settlement, and
with the view of having the amounts collected thereon placed
to his credit. The funds colleoted upon all the policies,
amounting to about $109,000, went into the hands of the
defendants. The complainant claims that his interest and that
of defendants in the amouits recovered is in the ratio of
$152,266 to $29,327, that being their relative proportion in
the total amount of insurance, and that the defendants ought
to account to him according to that proportion, and pay their
just share of the expenses incident to the collection thereof, as
well as compensate him for his services in connection with the
suits. These and other smaller items of account constitute
the matters in controversy.
While admitting the general facts in respect to the transacVOL.

cL-21

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Statement of the Case.

tion, the defendants set up in their answer that by the terms
of the contract the complainant became the insurer of the
goods, and was bound thereby to either sell them in Mexico
and account for the proceeds, or to return them to New York
free of all expense to the defendants; and that, recognizing
such liability, the complainant insured all the goods, making
no distinction in the manner.of such insurance between his
individual goods and the consigned goods; and that the policies transferred to the defendants by the complainant were
transferred as collateral security for the performance of the
contract, which was upon a gold valuation, and that no part
of the policies was held in trust for the complainant.
On this theory the defendants kept their account of the
transaction in the name of the "Mexican Arms Account," in
which the goods consigned were charged at the price of
$39,887.60, and to this was added the premium upon gold at
45 per cent, amounting to $17,949.42; and on the aggregate
of these two sums interest was computed from September,
1867, to May 1, 1882, amounting to $53,801.28. This account
was also charged with the expenses connected with the suits
on the policies turned over to them, amounting with interest
to $16,710.72. These expenses consisted of attorneys' fees and
sundry outlays for witnesses in connection with the suits.
These various items were not charged or entered as debits
against Sturm until 1876, when, they were transferred from
the "Mexican Arms Account" to his account.
The defendants' construction of the contract and method of
keeping the account was not communicated to the complainant until some time in 1876, when he promptly denied its
correctness. The court below adopted the defendants' interpretation of the contract, holding that the consigned goods
were at the risk of complainant; that he was responsible for
their loss, although arising from inevitable accident, because
he had undertaken to return them if not sold, and that, being
so responsible, the defendants had a right to charge him with
the value thereof, and treat the policies turned over to them as
collateral security for this liability; and were furthermore
entitled to charge him with the expenses of collecting such

STURM -v. BOKER.
Argument for Appellees.

policies, so that the complainant -was entitled to credit only
for the net amounts collected thereon. For this and the
f rther reason - as the court assumed - that the complainant

had given testimony in the insurance cases and made admissions under oath which were inconsistent with his -present
claim, and which should repel him from a court of equity, his
bill was dismissed.
If, by the terms of the contract, as embodied in the letters
of September IS and October 24, 1867, the title to the goods
vested in the complainant, or they Viere to be at his risk
during their transit to Mexico, then it is conceded that upon
an adjustment of the accounts between the parties on that
basis -with the allowance to the defendants of a premium of
45 per cent for gold - there is little or nothing due to the
complainant, and no substantial error in the decree dismissing
his bill; on the other hand, if the title to the goods delivered
did not vest in the complainant under the terms of the consignment, or he was notresponsible for the loss of the same by
inevitable accident, then the court below was in error in dismissing his bill and denying the account sought.
Jr.Jokn 31. Butler and -Mr.Solomon Claypool,(with whom'
was Mr. William A. Hetcham on the brief,) for appellant.
-Mr. Albert Bakcer and Mr1. William D. Guthrie, (with
whom was .r. Clarence A. Seward on the brief,) for appel-'
lees.
I I. The bill was properly dismissed for want of equity.
The actions against the insurance companies were prosecuted, and the payment of the policies was ultimately compelled, upon the claim that the legal title to the consigned
goods was in the complainant Sturm by purchase; that the
shipment was at his risk, and that he was liable-to the defendants, Hermann Boker & Co., for the invoice value of the consigned goods, payable in gold. If the claim as made in the
insurance litigation was true, the complainant concededly and
indisputably has no cause of action in this suit. Sturm, in the

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Argument for Appellees.

course of that litigation, repeatedly swore that he was the
owner of, and liable for, the value of the consigned goods;
but he now pretends that these oaths were false, and virtually
confesses that the New York courts Wvere then deceived and
the insurance compaxnies defrauded for the benefit of himself
and the defendants.
It must be borne in mind that this perjury in the insurance
cases was for the purpose of fastening liability upon the
insurance companies, and recovering on the basis of legal
ownership and liability, on Sturm's part, for the value in gold
of the consigned goods; that this position was vital to the
insurance cases as then framed, without which nothing could
have been recovered, because he could not have established
sufficient insurable interest; and that the parties have succeeded
in collecting from the insurance companies on that basis. It
matters not from what aspect we look at the bill of complaint
herein: whether brought for an accounting of the $109,126.27
collected from the insurance companies, 'or brought to obtain
reimbursement for expenses and payment for services. The
money was collected by perjury; the expenses were incurred
and the services rendered in the perpetration of a fraud. Even
if 'ive. assume that the complainant's charge that the defendants participated in this fraud is true, we are, nevertheless,
entitledto, the benefit of the maxim, "in pari delicto,Zpotior
est conditio defendentis." .Dent 'v. Ferguson, 132 U. S. 50;

If. The consigned goods', under the- original contract
between the parties, were shipped at Sturm's risk, and, upon
their loss at sea, he was liable to pay for the same at the
invoice value thereof.

STURM v. BOKER.
Argument for Appellees.

The legal effect of the agreement to return the consigned
goods free of all charges and expenses t6 the defendants was
to make him liable as purchaser in case of failure to return.
Such was the practical interpretation acted on by the parties,
sworn to by Mr. Sturm in the insurance litigation, acquiesced
in for at least nine years. The contract, therefore, as so interpreted.and acted upon, was not a baihnent, but a conditional
sale, with the option to return if not sold. -Moss v. Swect, 16
Q. B. 493, 4941 ; .Martineauv. Xitching,L. R. 7 Q. B. 4136, 455;
Schlesinger v. Stratton, 9 R. I. 578, 581.
If it be insisted that the title did not pass to the vendee, the
intention th.-t the risk should be assumed by him will nevertheless prevail and be given full effect. .F'aganov. Long, 4
B. & 0. 219; Castle v. Playford, L. R. 7 Ex. 98; Xartineau
v. .Kitching, supra; Stock v. Tnglis, 12 Q. B. D. 564.
The appollant's counsel may urge that the conduct of the
parties, until the present.litigation, proceeded upon an erroneous construction and misconception of the complainant's legal
rights, and that the complainant acted honestly but mistakenly in the insurance litigation. In view of his own testimony
in this case, such a claim is preposterous. But, even if there
had been no fraud, and the meaning. of the original understanding was doubtful, the court would not set aside the practical interpretation of the parties' themselves at the time of
the shipment and during the following nine years. If we add
to this practical construction, the proceedings, testimony, and
arguments in the insurance litigation, the conclusion must be
irresistible that the invoice recited truly what had been understood and agreed, :namely, that the goods were to be shipped
at the risk of Sturm. Chicago v. Sheldon, 9 Wall. 50; District
of Columbia v. Gallaher,1241 U. S. 505 ; YZnox county v. Ninth

III. The Circuit Court properly held that. the bill of complaint was based upon an agreement alleged to have been
made after the contract of consignment.
Reference to the bill of complaint will show, beyond question, that the claim for expenses and for services rendered is
alleged to be based upon an express oral agreement entered

coming into court prepared to meet, was this oral agreement
as alleged in the bill of complaint. The complainant should
not be permitted to change front and to claim upon an implied
obligation, after averring an express contract covering the
same subject matter. The issue between the parties thus tendered was not that of an implied obligation springing from
the original contract of consignment, hut (to repeat) an express oral contract to share in the expenses and to pay him
for services rendered. The fundamental rule of equity pleading and practice requires relief to be awarded'secundumr allegata etprobata, and does not permit a complainant to insist
upon relief because the facts, as proved, entitle him to advance
some other claim than that alleged in the bill. Simms v.

after stating the case, delivered the

It is too clear for discussion or the citation of authorities,
that the contract was not a sale of the goods by the defendants to Sturm. The terms and conditions under which the
goods were delivered to him import only a consignmetit. The
words "consign" and "consigned" employed in the letters
were used in their commercial sense, which meant that the
property was committed or entrusted to Sturm for care or
sale, and did not by any express or fair implication mean the
sale by the one or purchase by the other. The words, "Mr.
HI. Sturm in joint account with Hermann Boker & Co.," or
"Bought of Hermann Boker & Co., in joint account," in the
bill-head, cannot be allowed to control the express written
terms contained in the contract as set forth in the letters. A
printed bill-head can have little or no influence in changing

STUR

Opinion of the Court.

the clear and explicit language of the letters, and it in no way
controls, modifies, or alters the terms of the contract. The
purpose and object of the bill was to give a description and
valuation of the articles to which the contract as embraced in
the letters had reference, their description being important if
the articles had to be returned, and their price or valuation
necessary if they were sold and profits were made for division.
The contract being clearly expressed in writing, the printed
bill-head of the invoice can, upon no well-settled rule, control,
modify, or alter it. That the invoice was not intended to have
that effect is shown by'the fact that the invoice of the consignment of October 24 differed in several respects from the
invoice of September 18, although the terms and conditions in
respect to each consignment were the same.
In Schenck v. Saunders, 1 Gray, 37, 40, there was a written agreement in these terms:
"The said Schenck, Wood & Pond of the first part agree
to furnish the stock, consisting of upper and sole leather and
linings, and bindings, of sufficient amount to make at least
eight, and not to exceed twenty, cases per week. And the
said Charles Howe of the second part is to take the stock, and
make it up to the best of his abilities into women's boots; and
further agrees to consign all the goods he makes to the said
Schenck, Wood & Pond of the first part to be sold by them
on commission of five per cent, the goods to be sold for cash,
and the returns made to the said Charles Howe as fast as
made. And the said Charles Howe of the second part agrees
to put up and ship to the said. Schenck, Wood & Pond, at
their store in New York, at- least eight cases of boots per
week, each case containing sixty pairs, commencing the first
week in May, 1856."
With each shipment of leather to Howe, Schenck, Wood &
Pond sent him unsigned bills, like those in the present case, in
this form:
"Boot, Shoe and Leather Warehouse.
NEw YoRK, .May15, 1856.

In'a contest as to the title of these goods, (boots,) between
Schenck, Wood & Pond and an assignee of Howe, it was contended among other things that the invoices showed that the
transaction was a sale to Howe, and the heading of the bills
was relied upon to give such construction to the contract. The
Supreme Court of Massachusetts, speaking by Bigelow, J., held
that the transaction was not a sale, and that "the bills of parcels which were sent from time to time *iith the merchandise
were susceptible of explanation by parol evidence, and did not
change the terms of the written agreement under which the
property was sent to Howe. They were sent only as memoranda of the amount and value of the merchandise transmitted. Hazard v. Loring, 1-Cush. 267."
"An invoice," as said by this court in Dows v. National
Exchange Bank, 91 U. S.618, 630, "isnot a bill of sale, nor
is it evidence of a sale. It is a mere detailed statement of the
nature, quantity, and cost or price of the things invoiced, and
it is as appropriate to a bailment as it is to a sale.
Hence, standing alone, it is never regarded as evidence of
title."
Was the contract, as claimed by counsel for the defendants,
a contract of "sale or return"? We think not. The class of
contracts; known as contracts of ."sale or return," exist where
the privilege of purchase or return is not dependent upon the
character or quality of the property sold, but rests. entirely
upon the option of the purchaser to retain or return. In this
class of cases the title passes to the pui'chaser subject to his
option to return the property within a time specified, or a
reasonable time, and if, before the expiration of such time, or
the exercise of the option given, the property is destroyed,

STURAI

v. BOKER

Opinion of the Court.

even by inevitable accident, the buyer is responsible for the
price.
The true distinction is pointed .out by Wells, J., in Hunt v.
Wyman, 100 Mass. 198, 200, as follows: "An option to purchase if he liked is essentially different from an option to return
a purchase if he should not like. In one case the title will not
pass until the option is determined; in the other the property
passes at once, subject to the right to rescind and return."
The cases cited and relied on by the defendants, Moss v.
Sweet, 16 Q. B. 493, 494; .Martineau v. Eitehing,,L. R. 7
Q. B. 436, 455; Schlesinger v. Stratton, 9 R. I. 578, 581,
involved contracts of ': sale or return," in which there was a
sale followed by a destruction of the property before the option
of the purchaser had expired or had been exercised. It was
properly held in these cases that the goods were at the risk of
the purchaser pending the exercise of the option, and that he
was responsible for the loss of the goods or the pricd to be paid
therefor. These authorities are not in point in the present
case.
The contract under consideration did not confer upon the
complainant the privilege of purchasing or returning the goods
within any specified or reasonable time, for the defendants
retained by express stipulation a right to share in the profits
made on the sale of the goods in Mexico, and if they were not
sold to have the specific goods returned to them without
expense. In the letter of October 24 they specially direct that
the Springfield rifles, including those c6vered by the consignment of September 18, as well as those covered by the consignment of October 24, should be returned if they did not realize
the prices indicated in the invoices.
The contract in its terms and conditions meets all the requirements of a bailment. The recognized distinction between bailment and sale is that-when the identical article is to be returned
in the same or in some altered form, the contract is one of
bailment, and the, title- to the property is not changed. On
the other hand, when there is no obligation to return the
specific article, and the receiver is at liberty to return another
thing of value, he becomes a debtor to make the return, and

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

the title to the property is changed; the transaction is a sale.
This distinction or test of a bailment is recognized by this

eourt in the case of Powclr Co. v. Burdamdt, 97 U. S. 110,
116.
The agency to sell and return the proceeds, or the specific
gools if not sold, stands upon precisely the same footing, and
does not involve a change of title. An essential incident to
trust property is that the trustee or bailee can never make use
of it.for his own benefit. Nor can it be subjected by his creditors to the payment of his debts.
Testing the present case by these established principles, it
admits of no question that the contract was one of bailnent,
and that. the title to the goods, with the corresponding risk
attached to ownership, remained with the defendauts. Suppo~e a creditor of Sturin had levied upon or seized these
goods after they reached his possession; it cannot be doubted
that the defendants could have recovered them as their property.
That the contract between the parties in reference to the
goods in question was a bailment upon the terms stated in
the letters, ,is
clearly established by the authorities. Amoig
others, see Hunt v. fynav., 100 Mass. 198; 1T'alke2" v. Butterick, 105 Mass. 237: .Middleton v. Stone, 111 Penn. St.
589.
The complainant's common law responsibility as bailee
exempted him from liability for loss of the consigned goods
arising from inevitable accident. A bailee may, however,
enlarge his legal responsibility by contract, express or fairly
implied, and render himself liable for the loss or destruction of
the goods committed to his care -the bailment or compensation to be received therefor being, a sufficient consideration
for such.an undertaking.
This brings us to the question whether, by the terms and
conditions of the contract, as embraced in-the letter of September 18, consigning the goods, it can be held that the complainant assumed such a risk in the present case. lie assumed the
expenses of transporting the goods to [exico, the duty of selling them to the best advantage after they reached there, the

STURM v. BOKER.
Opinion of the Court.

obligation to account to the defendants for the price at which
they might be sold, less one-half of the profits in excess of the
invoice price, and if not sold, he was to return the specific
articles to the defendants free of expense. This agreement to
return the goods, in the event they should not be sold, it is
urged, imposed upon him the i'isk of their destruction before
he had an opportunity to sell or dispose of them unler or in
accordance with the terms of the consignment. We cannot
accede to the correctness of this proposition. The destruction
of the goods, without fault or negligence on his part, terminated his obligation to make either a return thereof, or pay
for their loss. Such a liability could only be imposed upon
him by a contract clearly expressing his assumption of the risk
of destruction, or his liability for the loss.
In the case of lTlnt v. 1V2pn an, 100 :Mass. 198, the bailee
was to return the property (a horse) in as good condition as
he received it by a designated time. The property was so
injured without fault on his part that it could not be returned
within the time agreed upon, and no attempt was made t6
retdrn it; still it was held that he was not responsible for the
property. The court said: " A mere failure to return the
horse within .the time agreed may be a breach of contract,
upon which the plaintiff is entitled to an appropriate remedy;
but has no such legal effect as to convert the bailment into a
sale. It might be an evidence of a determination by the
defendant of his option to purchase. But it would be only
evidence. In this case the accident to the horse, before an
opportunity was had for trial in order to determine the option,
deprives it of all force, even as evidence."
In Walker v. Butterick, 105 Maiss. 237, the following contract was presented:
"BOSTON,

.Tovemer 25tA, 1888.

"Alexander & Company of the first part are to take goods
from Walker & Company of the second part, and to return to
them, the said Walker & Company, every thirty days, the

Company, who will furnish Alexander & Company all goods

Alexander & Company are worth in real estate

and money $5000, of which they hereby certify.
"(Signed)
ALEXANDER & Co.
"We agree to the conditions of the within instrument.
"(Signed)
WALnIM
& Co."
It appears that some months after the date of this contract,
Alexander & Co. absconded, and one of their creditors levied
uporf goods which had been furnished by Walker & Co. The
court held that the contract under which Walker & Co.
claimed title to the goods levied upon, imported a consignment
of the goods for sale, and not a sale of them by Walker & Co.
to Alexander & Co., so that the title remained in Walker
& Co.
In Atiddleton v. Stone, 111 Penn. St. 589, A delivered to B
two colts, under a contract that B should safely keep and sell
them, if possible, before a certain (late for A, he fixing a minimum price to be received by him, and in addition thereto onehalf of all money obtained above that price to the extent of

lleld; that this was not a sale but a bailment, and it was error,
therefore, to overrule the offer of B to show that the colts
were sick when they were delivered to Lim; that one of them
died, and that he then offered to return the other to A, who
refused to receive it. It was held that the horses were at the
risk of A.
It is next urged, on behalf of the defendants, that the
taking of the insurance in the name of, complainant was a
recognition of his responsibility for the loss of the goods, and
that the policies of insurance were turned over to them to
secure this liability of the complainant. This position cannot
be sustained, for the reason that defendants, through their
partner, Funke, directed that all the insurance should be taken
-out together in the name of Sturm; and also instructed the
insurance broker to select for them the policies which they
wished appropriated to secure their interest. The act of
taking out the insurance, in the manner in which it was done,
was their act as much as it was the act of Sturm, and the in-

STURM v. BOKER.
Opinion of the Court.

surance having been thus effected in no way tends to establish
the contention that it was a recognition of Sturm's liability
for the loss of the goods.
It is not material to determine whether the complainant
ever endorsed and transferred these fbur policies to the defendants, or, if so, whether it was done at the time of their delivery or subsequently, for no such assignment or transfer thereof
was necessary to have enabled the defendants to recover on
the policies for the loss of cargo to the extent of their interest
in the same, it being well settled that under a policy running
to Sturm, "for account of whom it might concern," the defendants could show and recover their interest, in the event of
loss. It was so ruled by this court in Ilooper v. RZoinsonj 98
U. S. 528, where it was said that "a policy upon a cargo in
the name of A, ' on account of whom it may concern,' or with
other equivalent terms, will inure to the interest of the party
for whom it was intended by A, provided he, at the time of
effecting the insurance, had the requisite authority from such
party, or the latter subsequently adopted it."
In the present case, Sturm had the requisite authority of
the defendants to make the insurance on the consigned go6ds,
.as was testified to by the insurance broker, and -as shown in
their letter of September 18, 1867, in which they say: "As
you have insured these goods, as well as other merchandise, we
should be pleased to have the amount of $40,000 transferred
to us." It is clear that the insurance to the extent of $40,000
was intended to cover the interest of the defendants in the
consignment of September 18, 1867, and, in the absence of
any delivery or transfer-of policies representing that interest,
this could have been shown by them so as to. entitle them to
the benefits of such insurance.
It is next urged, and the court below seems to have taken
the same view of the matter, that the complainant is estopped
from denying his responsibility for the loss of the goods, because of alleged statements made by him as a witness in the
suits upon the insurance policies. It is claimed that-in those
suits he testified under oath that he was the owner of the
goods, and thereby precluded himself from asserting anything

to the contrary in this case, under the wise and salutary doetrine which binds a party to his judicial declarations, and forbids him from subsequently contriidicting his statements thus
made. We do not controvert the soundness of this general
rule as laid down in the cases cited by the defendants. Dent

5 How. 192; IWheeler v. Sage, 1 Wall. 518; ,Selz v. Unna, 6

.De lello, 12 East, 234; Post v. MJarsh, 16 Ch.D. 395; in
Great Berlin Steamboat Co., 26 Ch. D. 616. But the question
here is whether the statements made by the complainant in
the insurance suits bring him within the operation of this
wholesome rule? We think not, for it would be pressing his
language too far to hold that he made any positive statement
to the effect that he was the absolute owner of the goods, or
that lie admitted as a matter of fact, rather than of opinion,
that he was responsible for their loss. What he did state,
when his testimony is read as a whole, was that he-was the
owner on consignment, for when the direct question was put
to him, "What do you mean by being the owner for the time
being ?" his reply was, "That they were delivered to me by
Hermann ]Boker & Company under that agreement, and I was
responsible for those goods until they were returned, or until
I delivered the money to them. This is what I mean." And in
reply to another question, he stated that "the terms on which
I was the owner were expressed in"the papers I furnished,"
referring to the letters of September 18 and October 24, 1867.'
And to the further question whether he understood that
those contracts made the goods his property, his answer was,
"I understood so at the*time, certainly, and I believe so yet." 1
1 In the trial of the Ch-eat Western case, Sturm's complaint therein was
-placed in his hands, and he was asked whether he knew it contained this

STURM v. BOKER.
Opinion of the Court.

This language did not mislead or induce either the defendants or the insurance companies to alter or change their posiclause, "that at the time said policy was so effected, and all the time down
io the said loss, the plaintiff was the owner of said cargo?" and he answered, "Yes, sir."
"Question. Was'that true ?
"Answer. Yes, sir.
"Q. Was it true in respect to the goods consigned to you by H. B. &
Co.?
"A. Yes, sir."
Asked in the present case whether he so answered in the Great Tesura
case, he answered:
"A. Those questions were put to me and I answered them in that way,
and at the time, by advice of counsel, I wascorrect."
In the same case he was questioned and made answer as follows, referring to the Boker goods:
"Q. When did you become the owner of them?
"A. I had the whole responsibility.
"Q. When did you become the owner of the goods?
"A. The moment they were delivered on board the Keese."
In the same case he was questioned and made answer as follows:
"Q. What do you mean by being the owner for the time being?
"A. They were delivered to me by 1I. B. & Co. under that agreement,
and I was responsible for those goods until they were returned or until I
had delivered thie.inoney to them. That is what I mean."
Sturm in 1876, in the trial of the case of Funke v. The lew York .ltutual,
referring to the Boker goods, was questioned and made answer as follbws:
"Q. Was this entire cargo your property?
"A." I was responsible for the whole of it-in
the event of loss I had
to pay for it.
"Q. That is not an answer to my question.
"A. At the time I signed that paper - (paper referred to was his comlaint against the Lloyds)..
"Q. Was it true, as you swore in those pleadings, that these goods were
all your property?
"A. Yes, I believed that the whole of that property was mine at that
time.
"Q. Were the Boker goods yours which were consigned to you?
"A. That is true; the terms on which I was the owner were expressed
in the papers I furnished.
"Q. Do you understand that that made them your property? -Did you
understand that these letters made these consigned goods your property?
" A. I understood .so at the time, certainly, and.I believe so yet."
On page 503, Sturm's attention was called to his testimony in this same
case where he testified in 1876 as follows, referring to the Septeniber consignment from Funke;

tion in any respect whatever, nor influence their conduct in
any way. Both the defendants and the insurance companies
had the written contracts before them, and were presumed, as
a matter of law, to know their legal effect and operation.
What the complainant said in his testimony was a statement
of opinion upon a question of law, where the facts were equally
well known to both parties. Such statements of opinion do
not operate as an estoppel. If he had said, in express terms,
that by that contract he was responsible for the loss, it-would
have been, under the circumstances, only the expression of an
opinion as to the law of the contract, and not a declaration or
admission of a fact, such as would estop him from subsequently
taking a different position as to the true interpretation of the
Written instrument.
In Brant v. 7irginia Coal & iron Co., 93 U. S. 326, 337,
it was said: "Where the condition of the title is known to
both parties, or both have the same means of ascertaining the
truth, there can be no estoppel."
So in Brewster v. Striker, 2 N. Y. 19, and Yorton, v. Coons,
6 N. 'Y.33, and approved in Chatfleld v. Sinornson, et al., 92
N. Y. 209, 218, where it was ruled "that the assertion of a
legal conclusion, wh~re the facts were all stated, did not operate as an estoppel upon the party making such assertion."
In Bigelow on Estoppel (§ 2, pp. 572, 573, 5th ed.)- it is
properly said: "The rule we apprehend to be this: that where
the statement or conduct is not resolvable into a statement of
fact, as distinguished from a statement of opinion or of law,
and does not amou.t to a c6ntract, the party making it is not
bound, unless he was guilty of clear moral fraud, or unless he

"A. I did not."

Opinion of the Court.

parison of facts, propositions or the like, and afortioriif it is
the declaration of a supposed rule of law, the parties may, with
the qualification stated in the last sentence, allege its inco:rectness." And again (§ 2, p. 571): "A representation in pais
in writing, when not a part of a deed or made the subject of a
contract, though on oath, ,is no more efficacious, so far as the
question of estoppel is concerned, than a verbal statement."
These authorities lay down the *correctrule to be applied in
the present case, and, tested by the principle they announce,
the complainant is not e~topped from claiming his rights under
a proper construction of the contract, notwithstanding what
he said in the insurance cases.
The grounds of estoppel against the complainant are not
nearly so sUrong as they are against the defendants. It is
clearly shown that Funke, a member of defendants' firm, in
Mlarch, 1876, on the trial of the suit against the New York
M1utual Insurance Company upon one of the policies in question, distinctly swore that the complainant was indebted to
them only to the extent of $839,000, and that they had no
seourity whatever for the paynment of that indebtedness. In
his testimony ifi the present case he fails to explain that sworn
statement. That sworn statement is inconsistent with the
claim now made that the complainant was at that time indebted to the defendants to the amount of over $140,000; and
it is furthermore inconsistent with-the position now taken that
they held all the insurance policies, amounting to $163,000,
as collateral ._curity for conmplainant's indebtedness. These
sworn statemnnts of Funke related to facts which were as
well, if not better, known to the witness. at that time than in
1882, and subsequently, wheft he testified in this case. These
statements are unexplained, and if they do not operate as an
estoppel upon the defendants from now claiming a larger
indebtedness than was then stated, and from claimiig that all
the policies were turned over to theni as collateral security,
they certainly cast suspicion and discredit upon their testimony
in the present case. The question of estoppel need not be
further discussed.

tent evidence connected therewith, we are of opinion that the
construction which the lower court placed upon the contract
was incorrect; that the complainant was not an insurer of the
goods; that he was not responsible for their loss; that the
policy of $15,000 on the cargo of the Blonde turned over
to the defendants was intended to cover their interest in that
consignment, amounting to $10,560, and that the four policies
on the Keese's cargo delivered to them were to protect
their interest in the consigned goods carried by that vessel, to
the extent of $29,327; that they held these policies to pay
that amount in case of loss, and that the 'surplus, if any, was
to be held in trust for the complainant. But if there were
any doubt on this question, Exhibits "It" and "F," which
were produced by the complainant during the progress of the
suit, place the matter beyond all dispute. Said exhibits are as

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

These exhibits were vigorously attacked by the defendants,
who at first claimed that both the body and signatures of
the documents were forgeries. They afterwards admitted
that the signatures were genuine, but insisted that the writing
above them was forged. A great deal of proof was taken to
establish this contention, but it fails, in our opinion, to show

that these documents were forgeries. The signatures being
genuine, the burden of proof was clearly upon the defendants
to establish that the written part above the signatures was
forged. -The delay in the production of these documents is
fairly accounted for by the complainant, and they are in harmony with what, we think, was the true nature and characte'
of the contract and agreement of the parties.
Some reliance is placed upon what is called a 'statement of
his account made to Sturm in Indianapolis in May, 1875, by
Boker, one of defendants' firm. This account was clearly a
partial one. It was made up by Rabing, the bookkeeper of
defendagits, not from their books, but from memoranda furnished ,him by Boker, but from what source he obtained it
does not appear. The correctness of the account-shown by
loose slips of paper and imperfect memoranda - was disputed
by Sturm, and it is now conceded by defendants that it was
not a full and accurate statement. Sturm claimed that they
had not given him credit for money collected on, his insurance
policies, and that when they were all included the defendants
would be indebted to him. The circumstances attending the
presentation of this account, made at a time when Sturm
was contemplating going into bankruptcy, tends strongly to
show that the defendants were endeavoring to induce him to
admit a much larger indebtedness to them than really existed, in order to give them an advantage in the event of
bankruptcy. But, however that may be, there was no stated
account accepted or acquiesced in by Sturm, such as would
either conclude or require him to surcharge and falsify the
same.
We have not deemed it necessary todetermine whether the
September invoice had on it the printed words "payable in
gold" when it was delivered. Those words form no part of

Opinion of the Court..

the contract as embodied in the letter of September 18, 1867,
and complainant's acceptance thereof. They do not impose
upon the complainant the liability to account for the value of
the goods in gold in the event of loss by inevitable accident;
and not being responsible for the goods, nor liable for the losg
thereof, neither he, nor the proceeds of his insurance policies,
can properly be subjected to the birden of making good either
the defendants' loss, or paying such losses in gold. The insurance, as defendants admit, was not on a gold basis, but only
for the invoice price of the goods in currency. The complainant was not an insurer, nor in any way liable for even the
currency value of the consigned goods, and it would be a perversion of the contract and inequitable to require either him
or his policies to compensate the defendants for their loss in
gold.
We think the complainant has failed to make out a claim to
compensation for his services in atteriding to the suits against
the insurance companies.
In our opinion the complainant is entitled to the account he
seeks by his bill, in which he should be credited with the
amounts receied- by the defendants on the insurance policies
in the proportion of $152,266 to $29,327, that being their relative interest in the cargo of the Keese; that the expenses of
the litigation, including counsel fees, should be divided between
the parties on the same basis; that the complainant is entitled
to one-half of the sum of $1463.8-, paid by way of general
average on the goods shipped on the Blonde; to the further
sum of $672.68, for repairing the goods which reached Mexico
in a damaged condition ; and for whatever defendants realized
on life insurance policies of the complainant and on the notes
aNsing from the sale of the Iftdianapolis lots, if the amount so
realized did not have to be repaid in taking up the notes; and
with such othler amounts as he may have placed in the hands
of the defendants, either in the bank account or in the transaction connected with the insurance policies; and the defendants will be credited with all the amounts paid to and for the
account of complainant not covered by the foregoing ruliiigs.
The-account Will be stated up to the filing of the bill, and any

opinion.

that all-suits and proceedings arisingoutof the provisions of law governing national bankiug associations, in which the United States or any of
its officers or agents are parties, shall be conducted by the District Attorneys of the several'districts, under the direction and supervision of the
Solicitor of the Treasury.

gibsequently, in August, 1885, dismissed on motion of the
receiver as settled.

was'heard by the"court without a jury. Judgment was rendered-for the defendant in conformity with the opinion of the
Circuit Judg&. 35 Fed. Rep. 721, 729; 36 Fed. Rep.' 487.
