UNITED STATES v. PAGE.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 1249.Submitted January 5, 1891.-Decided January 19, 1891.

The decision of the President confirming or disapproving the sentence of
a general court-martial in time of peace extending to the loss of life or
the dismission of a commissioned officer, or in time of peace or war
respecting a general officer, under the provisions of the 65th Article of
war, is a judicial act to be done by him personally, and is not an official
act presumptively his; but it need not be attested by his sign manual in
order to be effectual.
Rankle v. United States, 122 U. S. 543, distinguished from this case.

FRmxic A. PAGE filed his petition in the Court of Claims on
the 31st day of August, 1887, stating:
"I. That he is a citizen of the United States and a resident
of the District of Columbia. II. That on the 18th day of
January, A.D. 1865, he was duly appointed and commissioned
as a second lieutenant in the Veteran Reserve Corps of the
volunteer army of the United States, and served as such officer
until the 20th day of September, A.D. 1866, when he was honorably mustered out of such military service of the United
States. III. That on the 3d day of October, A.D* 1866, he
was duly appointed and commissioned as a second lieutenant
in the Forty-fourth Regiment of Infantry of the Army of theUnited States, to rank as such from the 28th day of July, A.D.
1866, and that he accepted such appointment on the 3d day
of October, 1866. IV. That he served in said capacity until
the 3d day of August, 1870, when he was transferred to the

named regiment until the 22d day of September, 1871, when,
by order of the President, he was, upon the recommendation
of the retiring board of the U. S. Army, retired from active
service, and was placed upon the retired list of the Army as
such second lieutenant. VI. That from said last-mentioned
date to the date of the filing of this petition he has ever since
remained a second lieutenant upon the said retired list, subject
to all the regulations and orders governing officers upon the
retired list; yet, notwithstanding, ever since the "27th day
of May, 1874, he has been refused all pay and emoluments to
which he is lawfully entitled, by reason, as alleged, of a certain
order issued by the Adjutant General of the Army, dated War
Department, Adjutant General's Office, May 27, 1874, and
purporting to be General Court-Martial Orders, No. 42,
wherein and whereby, by paragraph III of said order, it is
asserted that your petitioner ceases to be an officer of the
Army from the date of said order, by reason whereof the
proper officers of the Pay Department of the Army have
refused to pay to your petitioner the pay and emoluments to
which he is lawfully entitled. VII. Your petitioner avers
that the said order, so far-as the same purports to dismiss him
from the Army of the United States, or to deprive him of his
said office, is null and void, and that he is entitled to receive
his lawful pay, and to have and retain the said office, notwithstanding the said order; that the court-martial proceedings
upon which tWe said order was predicated were never submitted
to or approved by the President of the United States, and
without such approval no power existed in the Adjutant General or the Secretary of War to deprive him of his commission
or his lawful pay as such second lieutenant.
"And your petitioner claims the sum of seventeen thousand eight hundred and thirty-five dollars and sixty cents
($17,835.60) as and for his pay as such second lieutenant for
the period from the 28th day of -ay, 1874, to the 30th day
of June, 1887."
Petitioner subsequently departed this life testate, and the
suit was revived in favor of Sally E. Page, as executrix, and,
by leave of court, she amended the petition "so as to claim

pay for said deceased as second lieutenant for the period from
the 28th day of May, 1874, to the 12th day of October, 1889,
being the sum of $20,816.33."
The findings of fact and conclusion of law of the Court of
Claims were as follows:
"Findings of Pact.

"I. On January 18, 1865, the claimant was mustered in as
a second lieutenant in the Veteran Reserve Corps of Volunteers, and served as such till September 20, 1866, when he was
honorably mustered out.
"October 3, 1866, he was appointed second lieutenant in the
Forty-fourth Regiment of Infantry, U. S. Army, and accepted
the appointment the same day.
"August 3, 1870, he was transferred to the Tenth Regiment
of Infantry.
"September 29, 1871, by order of the President, he was
retired from active service and placed on the retired list of the
Army, on account of wounds received in battle, i.e., the loss
of his right arm.
"II. April 29, 1874, a court-martial was convened at NewYork City by virtue of Special Orders, No. 73, dated April 7,
1874, Headquarters Military Division of the Atlantic, for the
trial of Second Lieutenant Frank A. Page (retired). Before
this court-martial Lieut. Page was arraigned and tried on the
following charges and specifications."
[Here follow three charges, there being one specification
under charge I, one specification under charge II, and three
specifications under charge III. To these charges and specifications the accused pleaded not guilty. The court found him
guilty of the specification under charge I, excepting as to
certain words, for which it substituted others, but not guilty
of the charge; guilty of charge II and the specification;
guilty of charge III and of the second and third specifications
thereunder, and guilty of the first specification, excepting as
to certain words, and as to those not guilty. The sentence
was, "to be dismissed the service of the United States." The
charges, specifications, findings and sentence are set forth at
length in Finding II of the Court of Claims.]

"III. The proceedings, findings and sentence were transmitted to the Secretary of War, who wrote upon the record
the following order, viz.:
" WAR

DEPARTMENT,

"Ws arNGToN CiTY, llfay 27, 1874.

"In conformity with the 65th of the Rules and Articles of
War, the proceedings of the general court-martial to the foregoing case, have been forwarded to the Secretary of War, and
by him submitted to the President.
"The proceedings and the findings upon the second charge
and specification, and upon the third charge under its second
and third specifications, are approved.
"With regard to the other findings, the remarks noted by
Major General Hancock, who convened the court, are concurred in as follows:
"' The finding to the first specification is not approved. The
sale of Lieutenant Page's pay accounts and right of pay to
the -Piedmont and Arlington Life Insurance Company is not
sustained by the evidence. The transaction was unquestionably a pledge as collateral security. But the court having
found that it was a sale, it is difficult to account for the rest
of the finding to this specification, which describes the subsequent presentation of a claim against the United States for the
same pay as false and fraudulent, although it acquits Lieutenant Page of knowing that it was such.
"'In order to constitute fraud there must be a knowledge
that the property belongs to another and a design to deprive
him of it. If these are wanting it is not fraud. So the word
"false," used in this connection, implies an intent to cheat or
defraud. Moreover, if the transaction with the Piedmont and
Arlington Life Insurance Company was a sale, as the court
found it to be, how could the accused, knowing that he had
made such a sale, .present a claim for the same pay without
knowing that it was false and fraudulent? By its finding to
the specification the court convicts the accused of presenting
a claim against the United States for his pay which was false
and fraudulent, and yet acquits him of the charge of "present-

ing for payment a false and fraudulent claim against the
United States." The finding to the first charge is therefore
likewise disapproved.
"'Again, having by its finding to the specification of the 1st
charge characterized the presenting of a claim for pay as false
and fraudulent, the court, by its finding to the 1st specification of the 3d charge, say that he did not do it "fraudulently
and dishonorably," nor "knowing that he had no right or property in said claim or payment," and this, notwithstanding that
he is by the same finding found guilty of "defraudin g the
United States."
"'The finding to this specification, however, convicts the
accused of the facts upon which it is based.'
"The sentence is approved.
"Second Lieut. Frank A. Page (retired) accordingly ceases
to be an officer of the Army from the date of this order.

"Wm. W. BELKNAP, Secretary of War.
"The said Secretary also issued, May 27, 1874, General
Court-Martial Order, No. 42, announcing the sentence of the
court-martial, and that ' Second Lieut. Frank A. Page (retired)
ceases to be an officer of the Army from the date of this
order.' From the date of this order the claimant's name has
not been borne on the Army Register, and he has received no
pay as an officer of the Army since that time.
"OConcetision, of Law.
"Upon the foregoing facts, the court determines that the
claimant is entitled to recover the sum of $11,572.75:
"That amount being the sum due the decedent within the
statute of limitation of six years before the commencement
of the suit."
Judgment was rendered in favor of the claimant accordingly,
and the case brought to this court by appeal.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER,

after stating the case, delivered

the opinion of the court.
It is contended that the sentence of dismissal was a nullity
because it does not sufficiently appear from the record of the
court-martial proceedings and the endorsements thereon that
the findings and sentence were approved by the President.
The 65th Article of War, act of April 10, 1806, 2 Stat. 367,
c. 20, which was in force at the time of these proceedings, provided:
"Any general officer commanding an army, or colonel commanding a separate department, may appoint general courtsmartial, whenever necessary. But no sentence of a court-martial shall be carried into execution until after the whole proceedings shall have been laid before the officer ordering the
same, or the officer commanding the troops for the time being;
neither shall any sentence of a general court-martial, in time
of peace, extending to the loss of life, or the dismission of a
commissioned officer, or which shall, either in time of peace or
war, respect a general officer, be carried into execution until
after the whole proceedings shall have been transmitted to the
Secretary of War, to be laid before the President of the United
States, for his confirmation or disapproval, and orders, in the
case. All other sentences may be confirmed and executed by
the officer ordering the court to assemble, or the commanding
officer, for the time being, as the case may be."
Undoubtedly the action required of the President under this
article is judicial action. He decides personally, and the judgment is his own personal judgment, and not an official act
presumptively his. But that judgment need not be attested
by his sign manual in order to be effectual. This was so held
by Attorney General Wirt (2 Opinions Attys. Gen. 67), Attorney General Cushing (7 Opinions Attys. Gen. 473), and Attorney General Devens (15 Opinions Attys. Gen. 290); and in
the opinion of the latter, numerous instances of the attestation
of the President's determination by the Secretary of War are
given.
It is argued that the President was required by paragraph

UNITED STATES v. PAGE.
Opinion of the Court.

896 of the Army Regulations of 1863, then in force, to affix
his signature to the statement of his decision. That paragraph provided: "The Judge Advocate shall transmit the
proceedings, without delay, to the officer having authority to
confirm the sentence, who shall state, at the end of the proceedings in each case, his decision and orders thereon." But
the next paragraph, 897, read: "The original proceedings of
all general-courts-martial, after the decision on them of the
reviewing authority, and all proceedings that require the decision of the President under the 65th and 89th Articles of War,
and copies of all orders confirming or disapproving, or remitting the sentences of courts-martial, and all official communications for the Judge Advocate of the Army, will be addressed
to 'The Adjutant General of the Army, War Department,'
marked on the cover, ' Judge Advocate.'"
This provision, as is pointed out by Attorney General Devens
(15 Opinions Attys. Gen. 292), "shows that paragraph 896 was
intended to embrace proceedings other than those requiring
the decision of the President, namely, proceedings which may
be confirmed by the officer who ordered the court to assemble,
or the commanding officer for the time being, as the case may
be." And the Attorney General concludes that: "In the case
of the confirmation of a sentence of dismissal by a court-martial, no formality appears to be prescribed by law for attesting
the determination of the President; and as, in cases of that
sort, the attestation of such determination by a written statement, signed by the Secretary of War, is in accordance with
long usage, that mode of attesting the President's action, confirming a sentence of dismissal, is to be considered as sufficient"
(p. 295). We are satisfied that this view is correct.
Since, therefore, it appeared by the order of the Secretary
of War, written upon the record of the court-martial in controversy, that the proceedings had "been forwarded to the
Secretary of War, and by him submitted to the President,"
and that the proceedings and findings upon certain charges
and specifications were approved, and that the senten6e was
approved, the only possible conclusion to be drawn from such
statement is that the approval was by the President, in whom

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

alone was reposed the authority to act. The Secretary of 'War
declared that he had submitted the proceedings in conformity
with the 65th of the Rules and Articles of War; and the 65th
article required the whole proceedings to be laid before the
President for his confirmation or disapproval, and orders, in
the case. By what process of reasoning can the conclusion be
justified that, although these proceedings were laid before the
President for his confirmation or disapproval, yet the findings
and sentence were approved by some one else, who had no
authority to act in the premises? On the contrary, where the
record discloses that the proceedings have been laid before the
President for his orders in the case, the orders subsequently
issued thereon are presumed to be his, and not those of the
Secretary by whom they are authenticated; and this must be
the result here, where the approval follows the submission in
the same order.
In ]?unk le v. United States, 122 U. S. 543, the record failed
to show the vital fact of the submission of the proceedings to
the President. The findings of the Court of Claims in that
case upon this point were that the proceedings, findings and
sentence of the court-martial were transmitted to the Secretary
of War, who wrote upon the report that such proceedings,
findings and sentence were approved. But it was not found,
nor did the Secretary's endorsement show, that the whole proceedings had been submitted to the President. The Secretary
did, indeed, conclude his order with the statement that, in
view of the unanimous recommendation by the members of
the court and the previous good character of the accused, and
in consideration of evidence by affidavit as to his physical condition, presented to the War Department since the trial, and
credible representations as to his inability to pay the fine imposed, the President was pleased to remit all of the sentence,
except so much thereof as directed cashiering; but this court
held that the order was capable of division into two separate
parts, one relating to the approval of the proceedings and sentence, and the other to the executive clemency which was
invoked and exercised; and that it was only in relation to the
latter that the President seemed to have exercised a personal

UNITED STATES v. PAGE.
Opinion of the Court.

power under the Constitution, the power, namely, of granting
pardons, while the former indicated on its face departmental
action only. And this conclusion was fortified, in the judgment of the court, by the order of President Hayes stating
that the record of official action showed that the approval of
the proceedings of the court was by the Secretary; that IRunkle
had presented a petition to President Grant on the day the
order cashiering him was issued, averring that the proceedings
had not been approved by the President; that this petition
was referred to the Judge Advocate General for review and
report; and that this report was made; and by which order
President Hlayes, taking up the matter as unfinished business,
and acting as though the proceedings had never been approved,
disapproved of the same. "Under such circumstances," said
Mr. Chief Justice Waite for the court, "we cannot say it positively and distinctly appears that the proceedings of the courtmartial have ever in fact been approved or confirmed in whole
or in part by the President 6f the United States, as the Articles of War required, before the sentence could be carried into
execution." And he closed the opinion in these words:
"Such being our view of the case it is unnecessary to consider any of the other questions which were referred to the
Court of Claims. Neither do we decide what the precise form
of an order of the President approving the proceedings and
sentence of a court-martial should be, nor that his own signature must be affixed thereto. But we are clearly of opinion
that it will not be sufficient unless it is authenticated in a way
to show otherwise than argumentatively that it is the result
of the judgment of the President himself, and that it is not
a mere departmental order which might or might not have
attracted his personal attention. The fact that the order was
his own should not be left to inference only."
Inasmuch as it did not affirmatively appear that the whole
proceedings had been laid before the President, and it was
argued that this must have been so because of the exercise of
executive clemency, though the latter was declared to have
been influenced by matters subsequent to the trial, it was
thought that the order of approval could not be presumed to

Syllabus.

have been made by the President upon the strength of an
inference drawn from the remission of a part of the sentence.
The inference that the President had personally acted could,
indeed, be properly drawn from the substantive fact of the
submission of the proceedings to him, if that had appeared,
but presumption could not supply that fact, and then a presumption upon that presumption be availed of to make out
that the approval was the President's personal act. This, as
the Chief Justice remarked, wohld leave the fact that the
order was his own, to inference only.
Tie judgment of the Court of Claims is i'eversed and the
cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the ypetition.

COPE v. COPE.
APPEAL FROM1 THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF UTAH.
No. 1327.

Submitted December 22, 1890.-Decided January 19, 1891.

The statute of Utah of 1852, (Compiled Laws of Utah, 1876, sec. 677,) which
provides that "illegitimate children and their mothers inherit in like
manner from the father, whether acknowledged by him or not, provided
it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court that he was
the father of such illegitimate child or children," was an act of legislation within the powers conferred upon the Territorial legislature by
Congress by the act of September 9, 1850, 9 Stat. 453, c. 51, § 6; and was
not abrogated, annulled or repealed by the act of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat.
501, c. 126, to prevent the practice of polygamy and annulling certain
acts of that Territory.
The distribution of and the right of succession to the estates of deceased
persons are matters exclusively of State cognizance, and may be dealt
with by a Territorial legislature as it sees fit, in the absence of a prohibition by Congress.
Annulments of statutes by implication, like repeals by implication, are not
favored by the courts.
No statute of a Territory will be declared void because it may indirectly,
or by a construction which is possible but not necessary, be repugnant
to an act of Congress annulling legislation of the Territory; but such a
result must be direct and proximate in order to invalidate the statute.
The several acts of Congress respecting polygamy considered.
