HJENNESSY v. BACON.
APPEAL

FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT

OF THE UNITED

STATES

FOR

THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.
No. 1103. Submitted October 21, 1890. -Decided

November 10,1890.

If one party to a contract intends to rescind it on the ground of failure of
performance by the other, a clear notice of such intention must be given,
unless either the contract dispenses with notice, or it becomes unnecessary by reason of the conduct of the parties.
A settlement of a disputed claim between parties dealing on terms of
equality and having no relations of trust or confidence to each other,
each having knowledge, or the opportunity to acquire knowledge, of
every fact bearing upon the validity of their respective claims, will be
supported by a court of equity in the absence of fraud or of the concealment of facts which the party concealing was bound to disclose.

IN

EQUITY.

The case, as stated by the court, was as follows:

IT was adjudged below, 35 Fed. Rep. 174, that the appellees
Bacon and Rogers each owned in fee an undivided one-fourth,
and the appellant Hennessy an undivided one-half, of certain
lands in Washington County, Minnesota, and that partition
thereof be made between them upon that basis. Of this decree the appellant complains, his contention being that he
holds the legal title to an undivided half of the lands and that
the appellees should be required to surrender to him the title
to the other half.
It appears that the lands originally belonged to George N.
Chittenden of Illinois, and that by written contract of date

Statement of the Case.

March 27, 1882, he sold them to Bacon, agreeing to convey to
the latter, his heirs and assigns, "by a good and sufficient
deed of warranty, on or before the 27th day of June, 1882,"
upon the punctual payment of the consideration, $4400, at
such time as Chittenden should execute a sufficient deed of
general warranty. The contract provided that if Bacon failed
to pay the consideration, then the contract should be void,
"time being of the essence of this agreement."
On the 27th of June, 1882, Bacon, - his wife uniting with
him, -for the consideration of five hundred dollars, (of which
one hundred dollars was paid in cash,) assigned and transferred
to Hennessy all his right, title and interest in the agreement
with Chittenden. The contract of assignment provided that
Hennessy should receive a good, clear and perfect title to the
lands through a good warranty deed, with usual covenants,
running from Chittenden and wife to llennesy or from Bacon
and wife to Hennessy, if it should be thought proper to have
Bacon and wife take title from Chittenden; also, that iHennessy
should pay to Bacon the remainder of the five hundred dollars
upon receipt, and only upon receipt, "of such title through
such deed to said lands or upon the said fHennessy accepting a
deed of warranty" from Chittenden or Bacon. If Hennessy
(lid not receive such title on account of an incurable defect in
the title or other cause, the deposit made by him was to be refunded.
On the day of the execution of the contract between Bacon
and Hennessy, the latter made a tender of $4400 to Chittenden's agent residing in St. Paul, in fulfilment of the contract
of March 27, 1882, and demanded a conveyance in accordance
with its terms. Hennessy was informed, before making the
tender, that Chittenden had not executed the required deed,
and it was made then only to preserve his rights under the
contract. Shortly after the tender, Chittenden left with his
agent a deed, in proper form, to be delivered upon the payment of the price of the land, and of this fact notice was
promptly given to Hennessy and Bacon. Hennessy received
in the meantime an abstract of the title, and discovering therefrom that the record did not show a clear, unencumbered title

in Chittenden, he sent to the latter's agent a memorandum of
the defects therein appearing of record, and demanded that
those defects be remedied. The agent wrote twice to Henpessy, at Dubuque, Iowa, where he resided, urging him to give
attention to the matter - stating, in a letter of date of November 6, 1882, that unless some understanding was soon reached
he would return the deed to Chittenden, who would probably
decline to carry out the sale. Under date of November 16,
1882, he again wrote to Hennessy as follows: "Yours of 15th
inst. received in answer to a previous letter. You instructed
me to see Mr. Horn. I immediately saw him and satisfied
him as to some of the objections, consulted him as to others,
and left the papers with him. He expressed the wish to see
you about the matter in order that he might inform me directly
and positively what further would be required to make the
title good. I have sought in every way since you went into
this transaction to obtain an interview with you or some one
authorized to act for you in order to arrive at something definite, and have found it exceedingly difficult to do so. Although
instructed to refer me to Mr. Horn, Mr. Kavanagh did not do
so until I wrote you, and now that I have interviewed Mr.
Horn I find it difficult to reach any result. I am not accustomed to that way of doing business, and cannot say I particularly appreciate it. I would suggest that the best and
quickest way to come to some definite understanding about
the matter is for you to meet Mr. Horn and nyself at such
early time as may be designated by you. Unless this is done
by Monday next (Nov. 20) I shall return the deed (which I
hold ready for delivery to you) to Mr. Chittenden, and it is
doubtful whether he will carry out the same. Allow me to
suggest it is part of your manifest duty not to interpose interminable delays to the settlement of the matter, and that if
you will appoint the above meeting or designate Mr. Horn or
some other person who can act for you in your absence this
transaction can speedily be finished."
The evidence is conflicting as to what passed between the
parties after that date. But it is certain that the deed from
Chittenden remained in the hands of his agent for more than

three years; and that Bacon repeatedly urged 'Hennessy to
indicate more distinctly than he had done the nature of his
final objections to the title, or give up his contract of purchase.
iHennessy contended not only that Chittenden's agent well
understood the defects in the title, but that they should be
remedied. During all that period the lands were appreciating
in value, and by the fall of 1885 were worth more than
$30,000. Finally at the suggestion of Bacon, Rogers determined to buy them, the understanding being that Rogers was
to make the purchase, allow Bacon, as commissions, the difference between $5000 and the amount paid for the lands, and,
when Rogers got them, he was to give Bacon an interest of
one-half upon the latter's paying half the expenses necessary
to clear the title. There was an apparent cloud upon the title
of record. It arose out of a mortgage in which Sanborn
claimed an interest. Rogers, with knowledge of the contract
between Bacon and Hennessy, paid Sanborn $1000 for that
interest, and, on the 4th day of November, 1885, took a general warranty deed from Chittenden, paying the latter the
sum of $4:705.87. Chittenden took from Rogers a bond to
indemnify him against any claim and demand made or that
might be made by Bacon and Hennessy, or either of them,
and against any loss or damage by reason of the conveyance
to Rogers.
On the 16th of December, 1885, Rogers informed Hennessy
by letter, that, Bacon having forfeited his contract, he had
purchased the lands from Chittenden, and put his deed on
record. He sought by letters a meeting with Hennessy that
the matter might be settled between them. The latter, for
some time, took no notice of these letters, but, at last, he
wrote to Rogers, under date of January 21, 1886, saying that,
while he was fully assured of the validity of his title to the
lands, nevertheless, in the interests of peace and for the sake
of avoiding what might prove a long, vexatious, and expensive litigation, to say nothing of the bitterness of feeling
usually resulting from such disputes, he was willing to meet
Rogers and see if some amicable adjustment of the question
between them could be reached. He said : "I wish it, however,

therefrom, in any way, shape, or manner, waive any right, or
recognize or admit in you, or in any one else, any right, title,

or any part thereof, and that I emphatically must oppose, and

Hennessy and Rogers finally held a conference, which
resulted, March 18, 1886, in a written agreement between
them, which recited their respective claims to the lands, and
provided: "Now, to settle the same, the said Edward G.
Rogers hereby agrees to make and execute to said David J.
Hennessy a quitclaim deed of an undivided one-half of said
property; and the said Hennessy agrees to execute and
deliver to said Edward G. Rogers a quitclaim deed of an
undivided one-half of said property; and also, in further
consideration of said deed, to pay said Rogers the sum of
($2750.00) two thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars.
This settlement to be in full of all claims in favor of said
D. J. Hennessy and against one George V. Bacon and one
George N. Chittenden growing or arising out of any contracts
in regard to the sale or purchase of said land by said Hennessy
from said Bacon or said Chittenden. This agreement to be
executed and carried out as soon as possible, and at least
within thirty days from this date, if possible. Time is not of
the essence of this agreement."
Pursuant to this agreement Rogers made a deed to Hennessy for an undivided half of the lands, the latter paying
therefor the sum of $2750, and Hennessy made a deed to
Rogers for the other undivided one-half. Subsequently, Rogers
conveyed one undivided fourth interest to Bacon, and at a
later date conveyed to him the remaining one-fourth of his
original one-half interest for the consideration of $10,000.
The present suit was brought by Bacon for partition between

Opinion of the Court.

himself and Hennessy upon the basis of the ownership by each
of an undivided one-half interest. Hennessy having alleged
in his answer that the settlement of March 18, 1886, was a
fraud upon him, Rogers, at Bacon's request, repurchased, and
took a conveyance for, the one-fourth interest he had sold to
Bacon, and, with leave of the court, became a co-plaintiff in
the suit with Bacon.
.Mr. .Martin F. Morris and -Mr. Daniel P. Lawker for
appellant.
MAfr. Edward G. Roger8 and -Mr. Emerson ladey for
appellees.
MR. JusIcE HARLix, after stating the facts as above reported, delivered the opinion of the court.

It may be assumed, for the purposes of the present case,
that upon the tender to Ohittenden's agent, on the 27th of
June, 1882, of the full amount Bacon had agreed to pay for
the lands in controversy, Hennessy, as the assignee of Bacon,
became entitled to a sufficient deed of general warranty from
Chittenden; and that the conveyance from Ohittenden to
Rogers was so far in derogation of Hennessy's rights as such
assignee, that a court of equity, in view of the relations
between Bacon and Hennessy and of the knowledge Rogers
had of the written agreement between them, would have
compelled Rogers, at any time prior to March 18, 1886, (the
date of the settlement between him and Iennessy,) to convey
the title to Hennessy, upon the payment by the latter of the
balance due Bacon under the contract of June 27, 1882, as
well as of the amount Bacon had agreed to pay to Chittenden.
As Hennessy rightfully demanded a clear, unencumbered title
to the lands, and as Chittenden did not, personally or by his
agent, distinctly announce his purpose to rescind altogether
the contract of March 27, 1882, unless Hennessy, within a
given time, would take such title as appeared of record, it
may be that Ohittenden was not at liberty, consistently with

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

Hennessy's rights and without previous notice to him, to treat
that contract as abandoned, and to make the sale to Rogers;

the general rule being that if a party means to rescind a contract because of the failure of the other party to perform it,
he should give a clear notice of his intention to do so, unless
the contract itself dispenses with such notice, or unless notice
becomes unnecessary by reason of the conduct of the parties.
1 Sugden on Vendors, c. 5, § 5.
But Chittenden assumed to treat his contract with Bacon as
forfeited or" annulled, and executed a deed to Rogers. Of
these facts Hennessy was informed. He knew that Rogers
claimed the lands absolutely as his property under the purchase from Chittenden, and that the deed under which Rogers
asserted title was recorded. And he had accurate knowledge
of the title to the lands so far as it appeared of record. He
also knew, at the time of the agreement of 1886, of Rogers'
contention that the contract of 1882 had been forfeited by
reason of Bacon's failure to comply with its provisions. He,
nevertheless, *disputed Rogers' claim to the property. But
Rogers, with equal distinctness, disputed his claim. And this
dispute was settled by the agreement of March 18, 1886,
under which Hennessy consented to take an undivided interest
of one-half at the price of $2750, and let Rogers have the
other half.
He now contends that he was induced to make this settlement by false representations upon the part of Rogers, and
because of the suppression of facts that ought to have been,
but were not, communicated to him by Rogers. The evidence
upon this point is quite conflicting, and does not justify the
conclusion that Rogers made any false representations whatever, or that he withheld any facts he was under a legal obligation to disclose. Hennessy says that if he had known, when
conferring with Rogers, that the latter had agreed to let
Bacon have an interest in the lands, he would not have made
the settlement; for that fact, he contends, would have indicated collusion between Rogers and Bacon. We do not see
that ignorance of such fact affects the validity of the settlement of 1886, or that it would have prevented its consumma-

Opinion of the Court.

tion. If Hennessy had been informed of Rogers' promise to
give Bacon an interest in the lands, he would have known that
such promise could not, under the circumstances, have been
enforced. The money that Rogers paid Chittenden was his
own, and in the title acquired by him Bacon had no legal
interest. Rogers moved in the matter of the purchase from
Ohittenden entirely upon his own responsibility. With full
knowledge of the title that Rogers had acquired, Hennessy
deliberately chose to compromise the dispute between them,
as shown by the agreement of 1886, and by the deeds executed
in pursuance of its provisions. No fraud was practised by
Rogers. He was guilty of no unfairness. He concealed nothing that he was under legal obligation to state. His information in respect to the title was no greater than Hennessy had,
or than Hennessy could easily have obtained. It is the case of
the compromise of a disputed claim, the parties dealing with
each other upon terms of perfect equality, holding no relations
of trust or confidence to each other, and each having knowledge, or having the opportunity to acquire knowledge, of
every fact bearing upon the question of the validity of their
respective claims. Cleaveland v. Richardson, 132 V. S. 318,
329. Such a settlement ought not to be overthrown, even if
the court should now be of opinion that the party complaining
of it surrendered rights that the law, if appealed to, would
have sustained. After this settlement was made, Rogers was
at liberty, for any reasons deemed by him sufficient, to give
Bacon an interest in the one-half acquired by him under the
settlement of 1886, and the interest thus acquired by Bacon
did not inure to Hennessy by reason of the relations created
between them by the original contract of 1882. As between
Rogers and Bacon the lands became the absolute property of
the former under his purchase from Chittenden, and, under the
settlement of 1886, and, so far as Hennessy was concerned, an
undivided one-half interest was confirmed to Rogers, as his
property, to dispose of as he deemed best.
