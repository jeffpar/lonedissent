The only exception in respect to which plaintiff assigns
error here was to the overruling of her motion for a new trial,
which is not the subject of exception, according to the practice of the courts of the United States.
Various objections to the charge of the court were set out
as grounds for the motion for new trial, but it nowhere appears
that exceptions were taken to any of these matters, save as
involved in the overruling of that motion, nor does the record
show that the action of the Circuit Court was invoked upon
the ground that there was no evidence to sustain the verdict.
Our right of review is limited to questions of law appearing
on the face of the record, and we find none such presented
here.

MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE

FULLER delivered the opinion of the court.

This action was commenced by plaintiff in error in a State
court, and removed to the Circuit Court of the United States
for the Eastern District of Missouri upon petition of the defendant, on the. ground that the plaintiff was an alien and
citizen of France and the defendant a citizen of Missouri. The
existence of such diverse citizenship at the commencement
of the suit, as well as when the removal was asked, did not
appear affirmatively in the petition for removal or in the
record when that was filed.
We are compelled to reverse the judgment, with costs, and
remit the cause to the Circuit Court, with a direction to
remand to the State Court. Stevens v.N chole, 130 U. S. 230;
