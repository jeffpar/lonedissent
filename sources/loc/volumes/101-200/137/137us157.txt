of the oath of allegiance is the pivotal fact which changes the
status from that of civilian to that of soldier; that the enlistment was a deliberate act on the part of the petitioner; and
that the circumstances surrounding it were not such as would
enable him, of his own volition, to ignore it, or justify a court
in setting it aside.
The judgment of the Circuit Court will be
Reversed and the case remanded with instructions to reverse
the decree of the District Court and take such further proceedings as shall be in conformity with the opinion of this
court.

In re MORRISSEY, Petitioner.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCtT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.
No. 931.

Submitted October 21, 1890.-Decided November 17, 1890.

This case is rightfully brought here by appeal, and not by writ of error.
The provision in Rev. Stat. ยง 1117," that no person under the age of twentyone years shall be enlisted or mustered into the military service of the
United States without the written consent of his parents or guardians:
Provided that such minor has such parents or guardians entitled to his
custody and control," is for the benefit of the parent or guardian, and
gives no privilege to the minor, whose contract of enlistment is good
so far as he is concerned.
The age at which an infant shall be competent to do any acts, or perform
any duties, civil or military, depends wholly upon the legislature.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Solicitor General opposing.

Mr.. JusTCoBREWER delivered the opinion of the court.
This case, appealed from the Circuit Court for the Eastern
District of IMissouri, presents, like that of Grimley, Petitioner,
just decided, a question arising on habeas corpus as to the
right of the petitioner, an enlisted soldier, to be discharged
from military custody. An effort was made to bring this
case here by writ of error; but that was abandoned, and an
appeal rightfully substituted. In re ANeagle, 135 U. S. 1, 42.
The facts differ from those in that case, in this: The petitioner
was seventeen years of age, and bad a mother living who did
not consent to his enlistment. Upon his enlistment he drew
from the United States his uniform and equipments, and continued in actual service from the 23d day of August to the
13th day of September, 1883, when he deserted. lHe remained
in concealment until February, 1889, at.which time he had become of age, and then appeared at a recruiting office and
demanded his discharge from the army on the ground that
he was a minor when enlisted. In his oath of allegiance
he swore that he was twenty-one years and five months

Opinion of the Court.

old. It will be seen that the petitioner was within the ages
prescribed by section 1116 of the Revised Statutes, to wit,
sixteen and thirty-five years. Section 1117 provides that "no
person under the age of twenty-one years shall be enlisted or
mustered into the military servico of the United States without the written consent of his parents or guardians: Prnovided,
That such minor has such parents or guardians entitled to his
custody and control." But this provision is for the benefit of
the parent or guardian. It means simply that the government
will not disturb the control of parent or guardian over his or
her child without consent. It gives the right to such parent
or guardian to invoke the aid of the court and secure the
restoration of a minor to his or her control; but it gives no
privilege to the minor.
The age at which an infant shall be competent to do any
acts or perform any duties, military or civil, depends wholly
upon the legislature. United States v. Bainbridge, 1 'Mason,
71; lassumr v. Feeney, 121 Mass. 93, 95. Congress has declared that minors over the age of sixteen are capable of entering the military service, and undertaking and performing its
duties.
An enlistment is not a contract only, but effects a change of
status. Grimley's Case, ante, 147. It is not, therefore, like an
ordinary contract, voidable by the infant. At common law
an enlistment was not voidable either by the infant or by his
parents or guardians. The Zing v. The Inkhabitants of Rotherford Greys, 2 Dow. & Ryl. 628, 634; S. 6. 1 B. & 0. 345,
350; The Ring v. The Inhabitants of Lytchet .Matraves, 1
Man. & Ryl. 25, 31; 8. C. 7 B. & 0. 226, 231; Commonwealth
v. Gamble, 11 S. & R. 93; United States v. Blakeney, 3 Grattan, 405, 411-413.
In this case the parent never insisted upon her right of custody and control; and the fact that he had a mother living at
the time is, therefore, immaterial. The contract of enlistment
was good so far as the petitioner is concerned. He was not
only de facto, but de jure, a soldier - amenable to military
jurisdiction. His mother not interfering, he was bound to
remain in the service. His desertion and concealment for five

years did not relieve him from his obligations as a soldier, or
his liability to military control. The order of the Circuit
Court remanding him to the custody of the appellee was correct and must be
Affirmed.

UNITED STATES v. TRINIDAD COAL AND COKING
COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO.
No. 774. Argued October 29, 30, 1890.

Decided November 17, 1890.

Officers, stockholders and employ6s of a private corporation formed a
scheme whereby they made entries in their individual names, but really
for the benefit of such corporation, of vacant coal lands of the United
States. The scheme was carried out, and patents were issued to such
individuals, who immediately conveyed the legal title to the corporation,
which bore all the expenses and cost of obtaining the lands, and some of
the members of which had previously taken the benefit of the statute
relating to the disposal of the public coal lands: Held,
(1) That such a transaction was in violation of sections 2347, 2348 and
2350 of the Revised Statutes;
(2) That it was not necessary to the right of the United States to maintain
a suit to set aside such patents as void, that the government should
offer to refund to the corporation the moneys advanced by it to the
patentees in order to obtain the lands, and which the latter paid
to the officers of the United States;
(3) That the rule that a suitor, asking equity, must do equity, should
not be enforced in such a case as this;
(4) That if the corporation be entitled, upon a cancellation of the patents
so obtained, to a return of such moneys, it must be assumed that
Congress will make an appropriation for that purpose when it becomes necessary to do so.
A private corporation is an association of persons within the meaning of
those sections.

THIS was a suit in equity by the United States against the
Trinidad Coal and Coking Company, a corporation created
under the laws of Colorado and engaged in the business of
mining coal. The defendant held the legal title to six tracts
of coal land within the Pueblo Land District, in the county of
