WELLFORD v. SNYDER.
Syllabus.

the nature and extent of the injuries, made by the plaintiff's
physician while treating him for them, was held not to be
admissible as. affirmative evidence for the plaintiff, even
though it was attached to a deposition of the physician, in
which he swore that it was written by him and that it correctly stated the condition of his patient at the time referred
to. The question was not one which arose on the crossexamination of a witness or in regard to his impeachment.
Nor was the present case one involving the well-established
proposition, that incompetent questions are not allowable on
cross-examination in order to predicate upon them an impeachment or contradiction of the witness.
The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the
Circuit Court, with a direction to grant a new trial.

Statement of the Case.

THis was a bill in equity, in the nature of a bill of interpleader, for the construction of the will, dated .July 1, 1824,
of John Tayloe, by which, after providing for his wife, giving
an annuity of $1200 to a daughter-in-law, making a devise to
a grandson, and devising and bequeathing the greater part of
his lands and personal property to his six sons, he provided
for his daughters as follows:
"Having, at the time of the intermarriage of my daughter
Mrs. Henrietta Hill Key, settled upon her ten thousand dollars, I give and bequeath to the said Henrietta ten thousand
dollars more to be settled upon her, to her own separate use
during her life, and after her death upon her children and
their descendants. I wish however to be taken, as a part of
the ten thousand dollars now bequeathed, about fifteen hundred and seventy-two dollars ninety and a half cents, which
I paid on account of her husband a short time since, and for
which a settlement of slaves has already been made upon her.
And also any other sums of money which I have heretofore
paid, or may hereafter pay or become liable for on account
of her said husband. These sums are to form a part of the
ten thousand dollars hereby directed to be settled, and are not
to be taken in addition thereto.
"I give and bequeath to my daughters Catharine, Elizabeth
M., Virginia and Anne 0. Tayloe twenty thousand dollars
apiece, to be vested in United States Bank stock or in government securities, which stock or securities I do hereby direct
that my executors hereinafter named shall hold in trust for
my said daughters respectively, and shall apply the dividends,
interest or profits of the said stock or securities to the use and
benefit of my said daughters Catharine, Elizabeth M., Virginia
and Anne 0. Tayloe severally and respectively, as the said dividends, interest and profits shall accrue; and from and after the
intermarriage of any of them, then my said executors shall hold
the said bank stock or other securities belonging to the said
daughter so marrying, in trust for the following purposes, that
is to say, in trust for the maintenance of her and her husband
during their joint lives, then in trust for the survivor of the
said husband and wife during his or her life, and after the

WELLFORD v. SNYDER.
Statement of the Case.

death of such survivor, then in trust for such issue as she may
leave at the time of her death. And in case she shall die
without leaving such issue, then in trust for her surviving sisters (my other daughters) and the issue of any deceased sister
-such
issue taking such share as the deceased sister whom
they represent would have taken, had she been alive to take.
And it is my intention that the said stock and securities, as
also the dividends, interest or profits thereof, shall be utterly
free from the power or control of the husbands of my said
daughters. And the better to secure the payment of these
my daughters' fortunes, I do hereby direct that, if the funds
hereinafter particularly appropriated for the payment of debts
and legacies shall -be insufficient for payment of debts and
legacies, my estate generally must be charged to make up the
deficiency to my said daughters."
He then set apart, as a fund for the payment of debts and legacies, certain real and personal estate, and all the residue of his
estate of every kind not specifically devised or bequeathed;
and gave to his sons any surplus of this fund remaining after
payment of debts and legacies.
By a codicil, dated March 4, 1825, he provided as follows:
"James Baker, Esq., having intermarried with my daughter
Catharine, I have given him, in part of the fortune intended
to be bequeathed to my said daughter, the sum of five thousand dollars, and my said son-in-law having expressed a wish
that all the rest of the fortune intended for his said wife should
be settled upon her, I have annexed this codicil for the purpose of carrying that wish into effect, and do hereby declare
that all estate and interest whatsoever bequeathed by my said
will to my said daughter Catharine (except the five thousand
dollars given as aforesaid in part thereof) shall be taken and
received to be in trust to my said daughter Catharine to her
separate use and to her representatives, as designated and
limited in that clause of my will in which I have made provision for my daughters, it being my intention that no further
part of the said Catharine's fortune shall be enjoyed by the
said James Baker, but as the separate estate of his wife."
The will and its codicils were admitted to probate March 14,
1828.

Citations for Appellants.

The case was set down for hearing on bill and answers, and
was as follows: John Tayloe's daughters Catharine, Elizabeth M. and Anne 0. married and died, leaving children or
grandchildren. His daughter Virginia died unmarried, leaving
a will by which she bequeathed the sum of $20,000, bequeathed
to her by her father, to a daughter of Anne 0. The question
presented to the court was whether by the will of John Tayloe this sum vested in his daughter Virginia so as to pass by
her will, as her legatee and administrator contended; or, as
contended by the grandchildren of Elizabeth M., went, upon
the death of Virginia unmarried and without issue, to her
sisters or their issue.
The court entered a decree in favor of Virginia TaylQe's
legatee. 5 Mackey, 443. The grandchildren of Elizabeth
M. appealed to the court.

M. JUSTICE GrAY, after stating the case as above, delivered
the opinion of the court.
The decision of this case depends upon the true construction
of that paragraph in John Tayloe's will by which he be-

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

queathes to four of his daughters the sum of $20,000 each.
Neither the other paragraphs of the will, nor the codicils,
appears to us to have any material bearing.
The testator begins by giving and bequeathing to each of
these four daughters the sum of $20,000 apiece, to be invested
in United States Bank stock or in government securities,
which he directs his executors to hold in trust for his said
daughters respectively, and to apply the income thereof, as it
shall accrue, to their several use and benefit. Had the testator stopped here, there could be no doubt that the bequest to
each daughter of the principal sum and of the income thereof
vested in her the absolute property in that sum, which would
pass by her will, or, if she died intestate, to her representatives.
Page v. Leapingwell, 18 Ves. 463, 467; Achamson v. Ar'mitage,
19 Ves. 416; S. C. Cooper, 283; Garret v. Rex, 6 Watts, 14;
_l'airfax v. Brown, 60 Maryland, 50. The last sentence of
the paragraph, by which the testator, if a fund afterwards
appropriated for the payment of debts and legacies shall be
insufficient, charges his whole estate with the payment of
"these my daughters' fortunes," and "to make up the deficiency to my said daughters," tends to the same conclusion.
The operation of such general words to pass an absolute
title may doubtless be restricted by a context manifesting an
intention that the legatee shall take an estate for life only.
Thetherell v. 1Vet1herell, 4 Giff. 51, and 1 DeG. J. & S. 134;
Sheet's -Estate,52 Penn. St. 257. The real question, therefore,
is how far the intermediate provisions, in the paragraph under
consideration, restrict the effect of the general words of bequest to the four daughters..
The testator introduces those provisions by directing that
"from and after the intermarriage of any of them" his executors shall hold the stock or securities "belonging to the said
daughter so marrying, in trust for the following purposes,"
expressed in three sentences: 1st. For the maintenance of her
and her husband and the survivor of them for life, and after
the death of both "for such issue as she may leave at the time
of her death." 2d. "And in case she shall die without leaving
such issue," then for her surviving sisters and the issue of any

WELLFORD v. SNYDER.
Opinion of the Court.

deceased sister. 3d. The testator declares it to be his intention that both principal and income "shall be utterly free from
the power or control of the husbands of my said daughters."
By the order and connection of these sentences, and by the
natural and grammatical meaning of the words used, none of
them apply to daughters who never marry. The preliminary
supposition or postulate, that "from and after the intermarriage of any of them" the executors shall hold the stock or
securities "belonging to the said daughter so marrying, in
trust for the following purposes," underlies and attends all the
provisions by which those purposes are defined. Of those
provisions, as above classified, the first and the third, making
mention of husbands, cannot possibly apply except to married
daughters; and immediately after the last words of the first,
by which upon the death of a married daughter and her husband her share is to go to "such issue as she may leave at the
time of her death," follow the words, "And in case she shall
die without leaving such issue," which define the event in
which the second provision shall take effect. In this connection, the word "she" in the singular, and the words designating her issue, relate grammatically, as well as naturally, to the
married daughter and her issue, just mentioned; and not to
the four daughters, married or unmarried, and to issue of unmarried ones. The three provisions, whether viewed separately and according to the letter, or as a whole and according
to the manifest spirit and intent, all have one aim, and one
only, that the share of any married daughter (the income only
being received by herself and her husband for life) shall never
pass into the husband's ownership or control, but shall vest in
her issue, if she leaves any, otherwise in the testator's other
daughters or their issue.
The general design of the testator is manifest to give all his
daughters equal portions; the provisions with regard to the
shares of those who marry are not inconsistent with this
design, but are intended to preserve the benefit of the bequest
to the daughters and their children; and those provisions do
not affect the absolute title of a daughter who never marries.
This conclusion is in accord with a long line of English deci-

vested in her absolutely, and went to her legatee.

ST. PAUL, MINNEAPOLIS AND MANITOBA RAILWAY COMPANY v. PHELPS.
APPEAL

FROM THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR

THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.
No. 26. Argued and submitted November 6, 1890.-Decided December 22, 1890.

The grant of lands to the Territory of Minnesota by the act of March 3,
1857, 11 Stat. 195, c. 99, and the grant to the State of Minnesota by the
act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 526, c. 105, were grants inpraesenti,and
took effect by relation upon the sections of land as of the date of the
grant, when the railroads were definitely located, both as to so much of
the grants as was found within the limits of the State of Minnesota as
defined by the act admitting it as a State, and as to so much thereof as
was within the limits of the Territory of Minnesota under the territorial
organization of 1857, but was not within the limits of the State when
admitted as a State.
It cannot be safely asserted that it has been the general policy of the United
States government to restrain a grant of land made to a State in aid of
railways, to lands within such State, when a part of the line of road
extends into one of the Territories.
Where the language of a series of statutes is dubious, and open to different
interpretations, the construction put upon them by the Executive Department charged with their execution has great and generally controlling
force with this court; but where a statute is free from all ambiguity, the
letter of it is not to be disregarded in favor of a presumption as to the
policy of the government, even though it may be the settled practice of
the Department.
