as to create an exception to the grant, notwithstanding the
ignorance of the patentee. These suggestions indicated the
difficulties of some of the questions which might arise in
the application of the statute; but in the present case we
think that difficulty does not exist. Where a location of a
vein or lode has been made under the law, and its boundaries
have been specifically marked on the surface, so as to be readily traced, and notice of the location is recorded in the usual
books of record within the district, we think it may safely be
said that the vein or lode is known to exist, although personal
knowledge of the fact may not be possessed by the applicant
for a patent of a placer claim. The information which the
law requires the locator to give to the public must be deemed
sufficient to acquaint the applicant with the existence of the
vein or lode.
A copy of the patent is not in the record, so we cannot
speak positively as to its contents; but it will be presumed to
contain reservations of all veins or lodes known to exist, pursuant to the statute. At any rate, as already stated, it could
not convey property which had already passed to others. A
patent of the government cannot, any more than a deed of an
individual, transfer what the grantor does not possess.

MOSLER SAFE AND LOOK COMPANY v. MOSLER.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 248. Argued April 24, 25, 188. -Decided

May 14, 1888.

Claims 1 and 2 of letters patent No. 281,640 granted to Moses Mosler, July
17, 1883, for an improvement in fire-proof safes, namely, " 1. An angle
bar for safe-frames, consisting substantially as before set forth, of a
right-angled iron bar, one of *the sides of which is cut away, leaving a
curve facing the uncut side, whereby said uncut side may be bent to bear
upon said curve to form a rounded corner. 2. An angle bar for safeframes, consisting, substantially as before set forth, of a right-angled

Opinion of the Court.
Iron bar, one of the sides of which is cut away, with curved cuts meeting a right-angled cut, w1ereby the uncut side may be bent to form
rounded corners," and the claim of letters patent No. 283,136 granted
to Moses Mosler, August 14, 1883, for an improvement in bending angle:
irons, namely, "The herein described process of bending angle irons,
which consists in cutting away a portion of one web by a cut which
severs the two webs at their junction, for a distance equal to the arc of
the corner to be bent, and removes sufficient of metal in front of the
single part of the uncut web to permit the same to bend to the desired
angle and to insure the edges of the opening meeting to form a close
joint as the bar is bent, substantially as shown and described," are invalid.
After a patent is granted for an article described as made by causing it to
pass through a certain method of operation to produce it, the inventor
cannot afterwards, on an independent application, secure a patent for
the method or process of producing the identical article covered by the
previous patent, which article was described in that patent as produced
by the method or process sought to be covered by taking out the second
patent.

United States for the Southern District of Ohio, by the Mosler

Safe and Lock Company, an Ohio corporation, against Mosler,

OCTOBER TERM,

1887.

Opinion of the Court.

Bahmann and Company, another Ohio corporation, for the infringement of three letters patent of the United States, each
of them granted to Moses Mosler, namely, No. 273,585, March
6, 1883, for an improvement in fire-proof safes, on an application filed February 5, 1883; No. 281,640, July 17, 1883, for
an improvement in fire-proof safes, on an application filed
December 27, 1881; and No. 283,136, August 14, 1883, for an
improvement in bending angle irons, on an application filed
December 11, 1882.
The answer denies that any one of the three patents shows
any invention, and also .denies that Mosler was the first and
original inventor, or an inventor at all, of the alleged inventions which the patents purport to secure, or of any of them,
and also denies that any one of the inventions has any utility.
It also denies infringement, and sets up various references on
the question of novelty, in regard to all three of the patents.
A replication was put in, and proofs were taken by both
parties, and, on a hearing, the court dismissed the bill on the
merits; its opinion, which accompanies the record, being reported in 22 Fed. Rep. 901. That opinion sets forth sufficiently the nature of the inventions covered by the three patents, and the contents of the specifications and claims, and we
adopt its statement, as follows:
"1. No. 273,585; application filed February 5, 1883; letters
dated March 6, 1883. The object of this invention, as stated
in the specification, is to provide an improved means of constructing the outer casing, so that the safe may be filled from
the bottom. The front and back frames of the safe are
formed from angle bars, which have one side cut away, where
the bends of the corners are to be made, and the uncut side
bent around to close the joint in the corner, and form a frame
with its outer corners rounded. The meeting joint at the bottom of the frame is overlapped by a short angle piece, which
is screwed or riveted to the frame, uniting the joint. A sheetmetal cover is bent around the top sides and around the lower
rounded corners of the frames. Upon each edge of this cover,
at the bottom of the safe and between the angle frames, are
secured metal bars, which project beyond the edges of the

MOSLER SAFE CO. v. MOSLER.
Opinion of the Court.

cover to form rests for the bottom plate. The safe is made
with the customary sheet-metal box forming the interior receptacle and secured to the cast-metal door frame in the usual
manner. The top of the caster frame conforms to the curve
of the rounded corners, and, after the bottom plate is pushed
into its place, the inner bolts which secure the caster frames
pass through the bottom plate which they secure and the
angle frames. The patentee does not claim the bent angle
frames nor the safe composed of these frames and the sheetmetal cover bent around them, (the same being shown and
claimed by him in an application then pending,) but limits his
claim to the combination, in a fire-proof safe, of the frames,
the sheet-metal cover, bent around the top sides, and lower
corners, with projecting metal bars, and removable bottom
plate, substantially as described.
"2. No. 281,640. This patent differs from No. 273,585 in
that a particular description is given, in the specification, of
the cuts in the side of the angle bar, where the bends are to
be made; but the patentee specifies that the shape of the cut
may be varied, it only being essential that sufficient metal be
cut away on one side of the angle bar to permit the other or
uncut side to be bent, the cut nearest the uncut side being in
the form of a curve or curves, so that, when said uncut side is
bent to form the corner, it will bear upon and be supported
by the curved end or portion of the cut, and thus be rounded
by a curve similar to the curve of the cut. The claims are a4
follows: '1. An angle bar for safe-frames, consisting, substantially as before set forth, of a right-angled iron bar, one of the
sides of which is cut away, leaving a curve facing the uncut
side, whereby said uncut side may be bent to bear upon said
curve to form a rounded corner. 2. An angle bar for safe
frames, consisting, substantially as before set forth, of a rightangled iron bar, one of the sides of which is cut away, with
curved cuts meeting a right-angled cut, whereby the uncut
side may be bent to form rounded corners. 3.In a safe, the
combination of the front and back frames, formed of single
bent angle bars, having one side cut away to- leave curved
ends, upon which the uncut side is bent to form rounded cor-

ners, and a metal sheet, E, bent around and secured to said
frames to form the top and sides of the safe, substantially as
described.'
"13. No. 283,136, dated August 14, 1883, application filed
December 11, 1882. The claim is as follows: 'The herein
described process of bending angle irons, which consists in
cutting away a portion of one web by a cut which severs the
two webs at their junction, for a distance equal to the arc of
the corner to be bent, and removes sufficient of metal in front
of the single part of the uncut web to permit the same to
bend to the desired angle and to insure the edges of the opening meeting to form a close joint as the bar is bent, substantially as shown and described.' In the specification the sides
of the angle bar are designated by the letters A and B. A
represents the uncut web, and B the cut web. The outer
opening of the cut, C, is made by lines at angles of forty-five
,degrees to the edge of the web, so that, -when the bar is
bent, the edges of this opening meet each other in a true
mitre. The inner opening, D, which extends outward within
converging curved lines from the angle of the bar to where it
meets the opening 0, extending inward from the edge of B,
and within converging lines, (the letter X suggesting the
shape of the entire opening, excepting that the outer opening
extends nearly to the 'angle of the bar,) has a dovetailed
shape, bounded by curved lines described from points upon
the mitre line and the face of the uncut web A. The curved
,ends of the web B abut against the uncut side when the bar
is bent, making a close joint. The patentee states, in the
specification, that 'the shape of the opening or cut-away portions of web B may be varied at will, so long as the meeting
line or lines be not extended beyond the space bounded by the
rounded corner, and the edge lines extended to web A.' The
angle bars cut out as described, it is stated in the specification,
may be bent to the proper form by the machine represented
by Fig. 6 in the accompanying drawings. ' In this, E represents a metal block having upwardly projecting sides screwtapped to receive clamping screw F. The opposite corners of
the block are rounded to fit the inner curve of the desired

Opinion of the Court.

corner. G is a loose block of iron, between which and the
side of block E the uncut web A is clamped by screw F, the
other web, B, resting on the block, the cut-away part over
the rounded corner; by force applied to the projecting end of
the bar it is bent around until the severed edges meet in a
close joint. The angle bar herein shown is not claimed here,
as it is the subject of a pending application.'
"The safes described in these patents are filled through the
bottom opening with fire-proof cement. The bottom is then
secured in place and the casters attached. The patentee
states, in the specification forming part of letters No. 281,640,
that before his invention safes were, filled from the back, and
that his safe ' can be completely finished before the filling is
put in. The filling adds greatly to the weight. Much labor
in handling is therefore saved."'
The opinion of the Circuit Court then proceeds to say:
"For the purposes of this suit these three patents may be
considered as one, containing all the claims- involved. As
counsel for complainant suggests, the claims are for separate
and distinct but not for independent inventions, at least so far
as the manufacture of safes is concerned. They might have
been all included in one application had the patentee chosen
to so present them.
"The first and second claims in letters patent No. 281,640
are for an angle bar for safe-frames, consisting of a rightangled iron bar, one of the sides of which is cut away, (the
cuts being curved and meeting a right-angled cut,) leaving a
curve facing the uncut side, whereby said uncut side may be
bent to form a rounded corner. The patentee states, in the
specification, that he is aware ' that it has been proposed to
make protecting corner pieces for safes from angle iron, from
one side of which a triangular piece was cut out to permit
the opposite side to bend.' He also states that 'the shape of
the cut to permit the angle bar to be bent to form rounded
corners may be varied without departing from the principle
of my invention,' etc.
"In the drawings accompanying the specification forming
part of letters patent No. 283,126, Figure 5 represents a templet

Opinion of the Court.

of card-board or thin sheet metal, which the patentee states
he uses to determine about tlie shape and size of the notch or
cut which it is necessary to make to admit of the bar being
bent to any desired angle and to make a corner of any desired
curve. The templet is of the shape and size of a section of
the angle bar. One web is severed by a cut at right angles
to its edge; the two webs are then severed at their junction
for some distance upon each side of the cut; then, by bending
the web so that the cut edges will pass each other, the templet
may be bent to any curve or angle desired, and the lines of
the cuts required to make the proper shape of opening in
angle bars to be bent to the same curve or angle, marked and
fixed upon. Such use of the templet as a pattern is nothing
new. It is clearly shown by the testimony, that cutting an
opening in one web of an angle bar to permit the bending of
the bar to an angle or curve, was known and used before the
date claimed by complainant's assignor for biis invention.
Different shapes of cuts and openings are shown in exhibits
put in evidence by respondents. Unless the precise cuts and
shape of opening shown in the drawing attached to the specification forming part of the letters patent are patentable, the
claims are worthless. But the patentee shows how, by the
use of a pattern of flexible material-an old method, and
familiar as the use of the carpenter's mitre box- he determines the lines of the cuts and the shape of opening. In this
there is no exercise of the inventive faculty; it is only what
would occur to a mechanic of ordinary skill. Moreover, if
the precise lines of cuts and shape of opening shown in the
drawings were patentable, the patentee does not, as we have
seen, so limit his claim, but seeks to cover variations, which
he says may be made without departing from the principle of
his invention. Claims 1 and 2 in letters patent No. 281,640,
and the claim in letters patent No. 283,136, are, therefore,
adjudged to be invalid.
"As to the combination claim, being the only claim in
letters patent No. 273,585, and claim 3 in letters patent No.
281,640, they are old, excepting only -and this is not material
- that the precise lines of cuts and the shape of the opening

Opinion df the Court.

of the angle bar are not found in safes of prior manufacture.
The sheet-metal cover is old. It is shown in respondent's
exhibit, 'St. Louis Safe.' The bars C and lower removable
plate D, claimed in No. 273,585, are old. See respondent'sexhibit A and the deposition of John Hurst. The safes in the
manufacture of which they were used were square-cornered,
as was then the fashion, but that is not material. When the
angle frames were bent the corners were round, and then
heated and hammered upon both sides of the corners, to make
them square. Respondent's testimony also establishes that
fire-proof safes were filled from the bottom as early as 1879,
by the Cincinnati Safe and Lock Company, and in that year,
probably also in 1878, by Hall's Safe and Lock Company.
The complainant was the first to employ the combination
claimed in the manufacture of round-cornered safes, but the
change from square-cornered safes was only a change in form.
The combination is nothing more than an aggregation, and
falls by the application of the rulings in Hailes v. 'Fan rormer,
20 Wall. 353, 368; _leckendorfer v. Faber, 92 U. S. 347; and
Pickering v. JAXcCullough, 104 U. S. 310, 318. The bill is
dismissed at complainant's costs."
It is apparent that the claim for the process, in No. 283,136,
is merely for the process or method of cutting away and removing the metal, so as to permit of the bending, and of doing
the bending, and of producing the close joint as the bending
takes place, such process or method being merely the process
or method involved in making the article covered by claims 1
and 2 of No. 281,640. In other words, claims 1 and 2 of No.
281,640 are each for an article produced by a described method
or process, and the claim of No. 283,136 is for such method or
process of producing such article. The method is a purely
mechanical method. No. 281,640 was applied for more than
eleven months before No. 283,136 was applied for, and was
issued 28 days before No. 283,136 was issued. There was no
,patentable invention in No. 283,136, when it was applied for,
in view of what was applied for by claims 1 and 2 of No.
281,640. After a patent is granted for an article described
as made by causing it to pass through a certain method of

operation to produce it, as, in this case, cutting away the
metal in a certain manner and then bending what is left in a
-certain manner, the inventor cannot afterwards, on an independent application, secure a patent for the method or process
-of cutting away the metal and then bending it so as to pro•duce the identical article covered by the previous patent,
which article was described in that patent as produced by the
method or process sought to be covered by taking out the
zsecond patent.
The Circuit Court, in its opinion, said that the use of the
templet shown in Figure 5 of No. 283,136, as a pattern, was
-not new; that cutting an opening in one web of an angle bar,
to permit the bending of the bar to an angle or curve, was
:known and used before the date of the patentee's invention;
that different shapes of cuts and openings were shown in exhibits put in evidence by the defendant; that the claims in
question, namely, claims 1 and 2 of No. 281,640, and the claim
of No. 283,136, were invalid, unless the precise cuts and shape
-of opening shown in the drawings were patentable; that there
was no exercise of the inventive faculty in using a pattern
-of flexible material, in an old and familiar method, to determine the lines of the cuts and the shape of the opening; and
-that the patentee had not limited his claims to the precise
lines of cuts and shape of opening shown in the drawings,
but had stated, in the specification of No. 281,640, that the
;shape of the cut to permit the angle bar to be bent to form
Tounded corners might be varied without departing from the
principle of the invention. We concur in the view that claims
1 and 2 of No. 281,640 and the claim of No. 283,136 are
invalid for the reasons thus given.
As to the claim of No. 273,585 and claim 3 of No. 281,640,
-which are claims to combinations, the opinion of the Circuit
Court states that those claims are old, except in the immaterial
point, that the precise lines of cuts and the -shape of the opening in the angle bar are not found in safes of prior manufacture; that the sheet-metal cover is old, being shown in defend-ant's exhibit, "St. Louis Safe;" that the bars C and lower
removable plate D, forming part of the claim of No. 273,585,

Statement of the Case.

are old, it baing immaterial that the safes in the manufacture
of which they were used were square-cornered, the corners of
the angle frames, when bent, having been round, and having
been then made square by heating and hammering the metal
on both sides of the corners; that fire-proof safes had been
filled from the bottom as early as 1879; that, although the
patentee was the first to employ the combination claimed in
the manufacture of round-cornered safes, the change from
square-cornered safes was only a change in form; and that
the combination was nothing more than an aggregation, and
fell within the rulings of this court, in the cases cited, that
such an aggregation was not patentable. We think these
views are correct.
The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.

HERRfAN v. ARTHUR'S EXECUTORS.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORIC.
No. 250. Argued April 25, 1888. -Decided May 14, 1888.
Goods made of calf hair and cotton were imported in November, 1876.
The collector assessed duties on them at 50 cents a pound, and 35 per
cent ad valorem, as upon goods made of wool, hair, and cotton, under
Schedule L of § 2504 of the Revised Statutes (p. 471, 2d ed.). The goods
contained no wool. The importer protested that the goods were liable
to less duty under other provisions. In an action to recover back the
alleged excess paid, the defendant, at the trial, sought to support the
exaction of the duties under the first clause of § 2499, commonly called
the "similitude" clause. Held, that this was a proper proceeding under
the pleadings in the case.
The court below having directed a verdict for the defendant, this court
reversed the judgment, on the ground that the question of similitude
was one of fact, which should have been submitted to the jury, as it
appeared that the imported goods were of inferior value and material as
compared with the goods to which it was claimed they bore a similitude.
The case of Arthur v. Fox (108 U. S. 125) commented on.

THIS was an action brought to recover duties alleged to have
been illegally exacted. Verdict for defendant and judgment
