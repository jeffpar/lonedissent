FLOWER v. DETROIT.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOI
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF AICHIGAN.
No. 203. Argued Apri! 3, 1888. -Decided

May 14, 1888.

Claim 1 of reissued letters patent No. 6990, granted March 14, 1876, to
Thomas R. Bailey, Jr., for an "improvement in hydrants," namely, "In
combination with a hydrant or fire-plug, a detached and surrounding
casing C, said casing adapted to bave an independent up and down motion sufficient to receive the entire movement imparted by the upheaval
of the surrounding earth by freezing, without derangement or disturbance of the hydrant or plug proper, substantially as shown," is invalid,
as being an unlawful expansion of the original patent.
The drawing of the original patent was materially altered, and new matter
was introduced into the specification of the reissue.
The decision in Parker& Whpple Co. v. Yale Clock Co., 123 U. S. 87, applied
to this case.
In the present case the reissue was not applied for until nearly eight years
after the original patent was granted, and the reissue was taken with the
manifest intention of covering, by an enlarged claim, structures which
in the meantime had gone into extensive public use, and which were not
covered by any claim of the original patent.
Claim 3 of the reissue, namely, "The combination of the hydrant or fireplug pipe A, supply pipe B, valve D, casing C, and stuffing-box H, substantially as and for the purpose'shown," is either an unlawful expansion,
in regard to the casing, of what is found in the original patent, or, if
construed narrowly, in regard to the casing, is anticipated, on the question of novelty.

Opinion of the Court.

Flower, Thomas Flower, and George Flower, against the City
of 'Detroit, the Fire Commission of the City of Detroit, Benjamin Vernon, president thereof, and the Board of Water
Commissioners of the City of Detroit, for the infringement of
reissued letters patent No. 6990, granted March 14, 1876, on
an application filed February 17, 1876, to Thomas IR.Bailey,
Jr., for an "improvement in hydrants," the original patent,
No. 75,344, having been granted to said Bailey, -March 10,
1868. Among the defences set, up in the answer, it was
alleged that new matter, not constituting any substantial part
of the alleged invention upon which the original patent was
granted, was introduced into the specification of the reissue,
and that the reissue is not for the same invention as the
original patent, and is void.
The specifications and claims of the original and of the
reissue are -here placed side by side in parallel columns, the
parts in' each which are not found in the other being in italic.

The tube A' is secured to

space is left between the bead a
and the upper terminus of tMe
casing C to permit of sufficient
up-and-down,play of the said
casing C, for the purpose
which will hereafter more
fully appear. Ths distance
between the bead and casing
may be adjustedto any desired
distance, thus lengthening or
shortening it, by means of its
screw attachment at its base.

The main function of the
casing C is to prevent derangement of parts during cold
weather by the ground alternately freezing and thawing
around the hydrant or plugThisprocessoffreezing causes
the surrounding earth, by its
expansion, to lift or upheave,,
and thus be liable to derange
the hydrant orplug. This upheaval or movement is received
by the casing C, which, by its
capability of slidingloosely up
and down, will accommodate
the upheavaZ of the earth above
mentioned, without any liability to derange the plug or
hydrant. This is the chief
function of the casing C, although it likewise serves the
purpose of protection to the
waterpipe A.

The drawings of the original and of the reissue are also
here [see next page] placed side by side:
The material difference between the descriptive parts of the
two specifications is that, in the reissue, it is stated that the
casing 0 is movable, and that sufficient space is left between
the bead a upon the hydrant proper, and the upper terminus
of the casing C, to permit of sufficient up-and-down play of
the casing C to allow it to slide loosely up and down, to accommodate the upward and downward movement of the
earth during the process of freezing and thawing, without any

liability to derange the plug or hydrant. The casing could
not thus slide loosely up and down, unless sufficient space were
left between the bead a and the upper terminus of the casing.
No suggestion of such arrangement is found in the specification of the original patent, and the drawing of that patent
shows no space between the upper terminus of the casing and

FLOWER v. DETROIT.
Opinion of the Court.

the bead or flange above it. This is new matter introduced
into the specification of the reissue, contrary to the express
inhibition of § 4916 of the Revised Statutes.
Claim 1 of the reissue is for an invention not indicated or
suggested in the original patent, namely, the independent upand-down motion of the casing. In addition to this, the drawing of the original patent shows a close contact between the
top of the casing and the bead or flange above it, so as absolutely to forbid any such independent up-and-down motion of
the casing as is covered by the first claim of the reissue, while
the drawing, Figure 1, of the reissue, shows a sufficient space
between the top of the casing and the bead or flange above it
to admit of such independent up-and-down motion.
Issue having been joined, proofs were taken on both sides,
and the Circuit Court entered a decree dismissing the bill,
from which the plaintiffs have appealed. Its opinion accompanies the record, and is reported in 22 Fed. Rep. 292. It
held that the reissued patent was invalid, as matter of law,
upon a comparison of the original with the reissue. We concur in this view.
It is sought to sustain the validity of the reissue by attempting to show that the model filed in the Patent Office with the
original application exhibited the invention covered by the
first claim of the reissue. It is doubtful whether that fact is
satisfactorily established. But, irrespective of this, the case
falls directly within the recent decision of this court in Park7er
& Ifhiffle Co. v. Yale 0ock Co., 123 U. S. 87. It was
held in that case, that what was suggested in the original
specification, drawings, or patent office model is not to be considered as a part of the invention intended to have been covered by the original patent, unless it can be seen from a
comparison of the two patents that the invention which the
original patent was intended to cover embraced the things
thus suggested or indicated in the original specification, drawings, or patent office model, and unless the original specification indicated that those things were embraced in the invention intended to have been secured by the original patent.
(See, also, fHoskin v. Fisher, 125 U. S. 217.) In the present

case, it cannot be seen from a comparison of the two patents
that the original specification indicated that what is covered by
the first claim of the reissue was intended to have been secured
by the original.
In the present case, also, the reissue was not applied for
until nearly eight years after the original patent was granted,
and the reissue was taken with the manifest intention of covering, by an enlarged claim, structures which in the meantime
had gone into extensive public use, and which were not covered by any claim of the original patent.
Infringement is alleged only of claims 1 and 3 of the reissue. As to the casing C of the third claim, it cannot, any
more than the casing C of the first claim, be held to cover
a casing which has the independent up-and-down motion
referred to. Such casing must be construed to be the casing
exhibited in the drawing annexed to the original patent, that
is, one in which the up-and-down play is restricted by the
overlapping bead or flange. On any other construction, claim
3 is an unlawful expansion, in regard to the casing, of what is
found in the original patent. In addition to this, if the casing of claim 3 is only a casing which has no end play, it isanticipated by what is shown in letters patent No. 19,206,
granted to Race and Mathews, January 26, 1858, which patent
was the subject of the decision of this court in Mathews v.
.Machine Co., 105 U. S. 54.
