OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Counsel for Plaintiff in Error.

MISSOURI exn rel. THE QUINCY, MISSOURI AND
PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY v. HARRIS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 256. Argued March 29, 1892.-Decided April4, 1892.

No Federal question is involved when the Supreme Court of a State decides
that a municipal corporation within the State had not power, under the
constitution and laws of the State, to make the contract sued on.

MAim~us, to compel' the performance of an alleged subscription by Sullivan County, Missouri, to stock of a railroad
company. The defence was that no valid subscription had
been made under the constitution and laws of Missouri. The
.upreme Court of the State, in rendering the judgment to
which this writ of error was sued out, said, in its opinion:
"The power of the county court to subscribe to the stock of
a railroad company was made by the constitution of 1865 and
Gen. Stat., 1865, p. 338, ยง 17, to depend upon the fact that
two-thirds of the qualified voters of the county at a regular.or
special election held therein should assent thereto.
Taking in this case the admission that the registration books
offered in evidence contained the names of 1940 persons as
qualified to vote in said county at said election, it is evident
that two-thirds of the qualified voters of the county of Sullivan did not assent to said subscription, as only 1049 of said
voters voted in favor of the subscription. Besides this, while
there was evidence tending to show that the railroad company
had complied with the conditions of the subscription, there
was also evidence to show that it had not complied, and the
trial court might on this ground have well denied the relief
asked. The judgment, for the reasons given, is hereby
affirmed."
