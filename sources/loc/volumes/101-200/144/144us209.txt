plaintiffs .inerror stated "the questions involved" thus:
"1. Under the contract, should the winter loss from December 29, 1883, to October 1, 1885, be added to the number of
cattle actually found and counted? or should only the winter
loss occurring from December 29, 1883, to the spring of 1884,
be added to the number actually found and counted?
"2. Under the contract; before the Red River Cattle Company could recover for any excess over 3700 head owned by it
on the 29th of December, 1883, was it necessary that more
than 3700 should be actually found and counted? or was it only
required that the number actually found and counted, when
added to the winter loss occurring after December 29, 1883,
should exceed 3700 head ?"

in error.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE: The only errors assigned which might
