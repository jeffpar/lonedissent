of a law of Congress. Neither could the salary of the postmaster be affected by any subsequent order of the Sixth Auditor, as was attempted to be done in this case; for, as already
stated, his duty and authority in the premises ceased when he
made his report of the business transactions of the office to
the Postmaster General. The whole theory of the act of
1883 is that every postmaster shall receive a salary dependent
upon and regulated by the amount of business done at his
office. The intent of the statute in this respect appears so
plain upon a careful reading of it that it is difficult to elucidate
it by argument or illustration. The mere statement of its
terms is the best argument in favor of the conclusion we have
reached.
The judgment of the Court of Claims was correct, and it is

Afirmed.

HEINZE v. ARTRUIR'S EXECUTORS.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF

THE UNITED

STATES FOR THY

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 146. Argued March 2, 1892. - Decided March 14, 1892.

Gloves made of cotton and silk, in which cotton was the material of chief
value were imported in January, 1874, and charged by the collector with
a duty of 60 per cent ad valorem, that rate of duty being chargeable only
on" silk gloves," under the act of June 30, 1864, c. 171, 13 Stat. 210, and
on "ready made clothing of silk, or of which silk shall be a component
material of chief value," under § 3 of the act of Mlarch 3, 1865, c. 80, 13
Stat. 493. The importer protested and appealed and brought suit. His
protest stated that the goods were only liable to a duty of 35 per cent
less 10 per cent "being composed of cotton and silk, cotton chief part,
the duty of 60 per cent being only legal where silk is the chief part."
The goods were made on frames; Held,
(1) Under § 14 of the act of June 30, 1864, c. 171, 13 Stat. 214, 215, the protest set forth distinctly and specifically the grounds of the objection of the importer to the decision of the collector, and was
sufficient;
(2) It was immaterial that the protest did not specify that the gloves
were made on frames;

(3) The goods were dutiable only at 35 per cent less 10 per cent under
§ 22 of the act of March 2, 1861, 12 Stat. 191, and § 13 of the act
of July 14, 1862, 12 Stat. 555, 556, 559, and under § 2 of the act of

TuE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Stpen G. Clare (with whom was Xr. Edlwin B.
Smit on the brief) for plaintiffs in error.
MrT. Assistant Attorney GeneraZ Par7er for defendants in
error.
lMR. J USTIE BIATCHForwD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an action at law, brought in the Superior Court of
the city of New York, July 15, 1874, by Otto Heinze and
Francis Gross against Chester A. Arthur, collector of the
port of New York, to recover $174.99, as duties paid under
protest on gloves made of cotton and silk. The goods were
entered at the custom-house of the port of New York, January 14, 1874, and the duties were .paid the same day. The
protest was filed February 6, 1874, and an appeal was duly
taken to the Secretary of the Treasury, February 24, 1874,
and decided April 30, 18-74. The suit was duly removed by
the defendant into the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Southern District of New York, by writ of certiorari.
The only question involved in the case is as to the sufficiency
of the protest. The defendant having died, his -executors
were substituted as defendants in his stead, in January, 1887.
The case was tried before the court and a jury, in June, 1888,
and a verdict was rendered for the defendants under the
direction of the court, followed by a judgment in their favor,
for costs, to reyiew which the plaintiffs have brought a writ
of error.
The protest signed by the plaintiffs was as follows: "On
an importation of the undersigned firm, per steamer City of
Brussels from Liverpool, duty paid January 14, 1874, containing partly cotton gloves mixed with silk, tho appraisers of
this port have levied a duty of 60% ad valoren, although the

article is only liable.to a duty of 35% less 10%, being composed of cotton and silk, cotton chief part, the duty of 60%
being only legal where silk is the chief part. We have paid the
excess in order to get possession of the goods, but shall hold
you and the government responsible for the return of the
same."
The bill of exceptions states that the plaintiffs' counsel, in
opening the case, "announced to the court and jury that
they claimed that the goods involved in the suit were dutiable at 35% either as 'gloves made on frames,' under section
22 of the act of March 3rd, 1861, and the 13th section of the
act of July 14th, 1862, or as 'manufactures of cotton not
otherwise provided for,' under section 6 of the act of June
30th, 1864." It also states that the plaintiffs, to maintain the
issues on their part, "introduced evidence tending to show
that on January 13th, 1874, they had imported gloves made
on frames, composed of cotton and a slight admixture of silk,
from 10 to 25% in value, and that the collector, Chester A.
Arthur, had assessed thereon a duty of 60% ad valorem,
which plaintiffs had paid;" that all other requirements as to
appeal and suit were complied with; that thereupon the
plaintiffs rested, and the defendants' counsel moved the court
to direct a verdict for them, on the ground that the protest
was insufficient, in that it did not distinctly and specifically
point out to the collector the ground of the plaintiffs' objection
to his classification, and contained no allegation that the
goods in question were made on frames, and that, while there
were in force at the time the protest was served many provisions of law, (including those alluded to by the plaintiffs'
counsel in his opening, as well as others,) providing for a
duty of 35 per cent, which might be applicable to the plaintiffs' goods, there was nothing in the protest to show which
one of them was relied on by the importers; that the court
granted the motion and the plaintiffs excepted; and that the
jury, under the direction of the court, found a verdict for the
defendants.
The only statutory provisions in force at the time this
importation of gloves, composed of cotton and silk, was made,

under which it could be claimed they were chargeable with
a duty of 60 per cent ad valorem, were § 3 of the act of
March 3, 1865, c. 80, (13 Stat. 493,) which imposed a duty of
60 per ,ent ad valorem on "ready-made clothing of silk, or
of which silk shall be a component material of chief value,"
and § 8 of the act of June 30, 1864, c. 171, (13 Stat. 210,)
which imposed a duty of 60 per cent ad valorem on "silk
. . . gloves," the same section imposing a duty of 50
per cent ad valorem on "all manufactures of silk, or of which
silk is the component material of chief value, not otherwise
provided for."
By § 22 of the act of March 2, 1861, c. 68, (12 Stat. 191,)
a duty of 30 per cent ad valorem was imposed upon "caps,
gloves, leggins, mits, socks, stockings, wove shirts and drawers,
and all similar articles made on frames, of whatever material
composed, worn by men, women or children, and not otherwise provided for," and on "clothino, ready-made, and
wearing apparel of every description, of whatever material
composed, except wool, made up or manufactured wholly or
in part by the tailor, seamstress or manufacturer."
By § 13 of the act of July 14, 1862, c. 163, (12 Stat. 555,
556,) an additional duty of 5 per cent ad valorem was imposed
on "caps, gloves, leggins, mits, socks, stockings, wove shirts
and drawers, and all similar articles made on frames, of
wliatever material composed, worn by men, women and
children, and not otherwise provided for," and on "clothin g ,
ready-made, and wearing apparel of every description, of
whatever material composed, except wool, made up or manufactured wholly or in part by the tailor, seamstress or manufacturer;" and also (p. 557) upon "manufactures not otherwise
provided for, composed of mixed materials, in part of cotton,
silk, wool or worsted, hemp, jute or flax."
By § 6 of the act of June 30, 1864, c. 171, (13 Stat. 208,
209,) a duty of 35 per cent ad valorem was imposed "on cotton shirts and drawers, woven or made on frames, and on all
cotton hosiery," and "on cotton braids, insertings, lace, trimming, or bobinet, and all other manufactures of cotton, not
otherwise provided for."

OCTOBER TER'I

1891.

Opinion of the Court.

By § 2 of the act of June 6, 1872, c. 315, (17 Stat. 231,) it
was enacted that on and after August 1, 1872, in lieu of the
duties imposed by law "on all manufactures of cotton of
which cotton is the component part of chief value," there
should be levied, collected and paid 90 per cent of the rates
of duty then imposed by law upon said articles, it being
stated to be the intent of the section "to reduce existing
duties on said articles ten per centum of such duties."
It is contended for the defendants that the protest is insufficient because it makes no reference to the gloves as "made on
frames;" that the trial related exclusively to a classification
of the goods as "made on frames;" that the protest was not
distinct or specific as to such goods; and that the paper called
a protest did not protest against anything.
As the importation in question was made in January, 1874i,
and the Revised Statutes, according to § 5595 thereof, embraced only the statutes of the United States, general and
permanent in their nature, in force on December 1, 1873, as
revised and consolidated by the commissioners, the question
of the sufficiency of the protest arises under the statutes which
existed December 1, 1873.
By the act of February 26, 1845, c. 22, (5 Stat. 727,) the
right to maintain an action at law against a collector to ascertain and try the legality and validity of a demand for a payment of duties, and their payment under protest, was restored;
but it was provided that such action should not be maintained
unless such protest should be in writing "and signed by the
claimant, at or before the time of payment of said duties, setting forth distinctly and specifically the grounds of objection
to the payment thereof." It was also provided by § 14 of the
act of June 30, 1864, c. 171, (13 Stat. 214, 215,) that the decision of the collector of customs at the port of importation and
entry, as to the rate and amount of duties to be paid on imported goods, should be final and conclusive against all persons interested therein, unless the owner, importer, consignee
or agent of the goods should, within ten days after the ascertainment and liquidation of the duties by the proper officers
of the customs, give notice in writing to the collector, if dis-

Opinion of the Court.

satisfied with his decision, "setting forth therein, distinctly
and specifically, the grounds of his objection thereto."
In the present case, the entry was liquidated January 30,
1874, and the protest was filed February 6, 1874. The sole
question for consideration is, whether the protest in question
set forth distinctly and specifically the grounds of the objection of the importers to the decision of the collector assessing
the duty of 60 per cent ad valorem on the gloves.
We think the protest was sufficient. The collector having
assessed the duty of 60 per -cent, could have assessed it only
under § 8 of the act of June 30, 1864, (13 Stat. 210,) which
fimposes that rate of duty on silk gloves, or under § 3 of the
act of March 3, 1865, (13 Stat. 493,) which imposes that rate
of duty "on ready-made clothing of silk, or of which silk shall
be a component material of chief value." The protest specifically states that the goods are "partly cotton gloves, mixed
with silk," and are "composed of cotton and silk, cotton chief
part, the duty of 60 per cent being only legal where silk is the
chief part." The words "chief part," used twice in the protest, clearly mean that in the goods, composed of cotton and
silk, the cotton is the component material of chief value, or
the "component part of chief value," and that the silk is not
the "component material of chief value." In this respect, the
protest called the attention of the collector "distinctly and
specifically" to the grounds of objection of the importers to
his decision, namely, that he had, contrar- to law, assessed a
duty of 60 per cent upon the gloves, in that he had treated
them as goods of which silk was the "component material of
chief value," when the contrary was ,the fapt, and the cotton,
and not the silk, was the "component material of chief value'
or "component part of chief value."
The protest further claimed that the gloves were liable to a
duty of only 35 per cent, less 10 per cent, and were, in fact, in
any event, liable to only that duty, whether liable to 30 per
cent. under § 22 of the act of March 2, 1861, (12 Stat. 191,)
with the 5 per cent added under § 13 of the act of July 14,
1862, (12 Stat. 555,: 556, 557,) or at 35 per cent, under the act
of June 30, 1864, (13 Stat. 208, 209,) with the reduction, as to
VOL. CXLIV-

3

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

all those provisions, of 10 per cent, under the act of June 6,

1872, (17 Stat. 231).
It is entirely immaterial that the protest did not specify
that the gloves were made on frames. It was sufficient to
state that the gloves were composed of cotton and silk, and
that the cotton was the component material or part of chief
value, and the silk was not the component material of chief
value. The importers were bound only to state, as they did,
that the duty of 60 per cent was illegal, and why it was
illegal.
In Arthur v. Unkart, 96 U. S. 118, it was held by this court
that gloves like those in question, made on frames, and composed of cotton and silk, in which cotton was the component
part of chief value, were not dutiable at 60 per cent, under § 8
of the act of June 30, 1864-, (13 Stat. 210,) but were dutiable
only under § 22 of the act of March 2, 1861, (12 Stat. 191,) and
§ 13 of the act of July 14, 1862, (12 Stat. 555, 556, 557,) and
under § 2 of the act of June 6, 1872, (17 Stat. 231).

Under the ruling of this court in Davies v. Arthur, 96 U. S.
148, 151, the objection set forth in the protest in this case, to
the decision of the collector, was so distinct and specific as,
when fairly construed, to show that the objection taken at the
trial was at the time in the mind of the importer, and was
sufficient to notify the collector of its true nature and character, to the end that he might ascertain the precise facts and
have an opportunity to correct the mistake and cure the
defect, if it was one which could be obviated.
This rule was affirmed in Greelys Administrator v. Burgess, 18 How. 413, 416; Arthur v. Dodge, 101 U. S. 34, 37;
Arthur v. JfXorgan, 112 U. S.495, 501, and cases there cited;
and Schell's Executors v. Fauchi, 138 U. S.562, 567, 568, 569.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is
Reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with an instruction to grant a new trial.
