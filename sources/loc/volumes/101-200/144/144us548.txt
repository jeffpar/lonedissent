, OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

form of relief will always be adapted to the obstacles to be
removed. The flexibility of decrees of a court of equity will
enable it to meet every emergency. Here the embarrassments to the complainants in the use and enjoyment of their
property are obvious and insuperable except by relief through
that court. No existing rights of the defendants will be
impaired by granting what is prayed, and the rights of the
complainants will be placed in a condition to be available.
The same principle which leads a court of .equity upon
proper, proof to establish by its decree the existence of a lost
deed, and thus make it a matter of record, must justify it
upon like proof to declare by its decree the validity of a title
resting in the recollection of witnesses, and thus make the
evidence of the title a matter of record. It is, therefore,
Ordered that the decree of the court below be reversed, and
the cause remanded to that court with, directions to enter a
decree declaring the title of the complainants to the premises described in their complaint, by adverse possession of
the parties through whom they claim, to be complete, and
that the defendants be enjoined from asserting title to the
said premises through their former owner. Each party
to pay his own costs.

MR.JUSTICE FIELD. The facts of this case are similar to those
in No. 216, just decided, and the same principles of law control

be entered, the form ef the decree to be adapted to the changed
interest caused by the death of one of the parties pending the suit.
