MINNESOTA v. HrCHCOCK.
Statement of the Case.

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
ORIGINAL.
No. 4. Original. Argued November 1, 4, 1901.-Decided May 5, 1902.

The original jurisdiction, vested by the Constitution in this court over controversies in which a State is a party, is not affected by the question
whether the State is a party plaintiff or party defendant.
A dispute as to the title to real estate is a question of a justiciable nature,
and can properly be determined in a judicial proceeding.
The United States are to be taken, for the purposes of this case, as the real
party in interest adverse to the State.
This court has jurisdiction of this controversy, and is called upon to determine the case on its merits.
Not only the technical rules of statutory construction, but also the general
scope of the legislation in these matters, and the policy of the United
States in respect to public schools, and also to Indians, concur in sustaining the contention of the Government that none of these ceded lands
passed under the school grant to the State.
The court is of opinion that the claim of Minnesota to these lands cannot
be sustained, and that the bill should be dismissed.

THis is a suit in equity, commenced in this court by the State
of Minnesota to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior and the
Commissioner of the General Land Office from selling any sections 16 and 36 in what was on January 14, 1889, known as
the Red Lake Indian reservation.
By the bill, answer and an agreed statement the following
facts appear: By section 18 of the act to establish the territorial
government of Minnesota, approved March 3, 1849, 9 Stat. 403,
it was enacted "1that when the lands in the said Territory shall
be surveyed under the direction of the Government of the United
States, preparatory to bringing the same into market, sections
numbered 16 and 36 in each township in said Territory shall be,
and the same are hereby, reserved for the purpose of being applied to schools in said Territory and in the States and Territories
hereafter to be erected out of the same."
On February 26, 1856, the legislature of the Territory of
Minnesota sent a memorial to Congress for the relief of settlers
upon school lands, Laws, Minn. 1856, p. 368, which reads:

OCTOBER TERTÂ£, 1901.
Statement of the Case.

"To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States in Congress assembled:
"The memorial of the legislative assembly of the Territory
of Minnesota respectfully represents:
"That under the provisions of the act of Congress, extending
the provisions of the preimption law of 1841, over the unsurveyed lands of Minnesota, many of our settlers have heavy investments, both of money and labor, in the opening of farms,
erection of buildings, and the laying out and improving of
townsites, (lots in which said townsites were frequently transferred before the government survey, at high prices, to the
occupants thereof,) who were found, when the government survey was made, to be upon the school sections, and that the said
settler had no means of ascertaining previous to the survey
where the school sections would come.
"That it is a great injustice and hardship to compel such
persons to repurchase or lose entirely the improvements and
homes, made by themselves in good faith, in the expectation of

pre~mpting or entering them according to the provisions of
the statute. Therefore, your memorialists would respectfully
request your honorable body to pass an act, giving such persons
in this Territory as have, previously to the government survey,
settled upon the school sections, (and have otherwise the right
of preemption,) the right to preimpt the same, as othei government lands are pre6mpted. And also providing for the
entry of the townsites in this Territory, which are on school
sections and were occupied as such, previous to the government
survey, as other townsites upon unoffered government laWids
are entered.
"And also allowing the county commissioners of the county
in which such lands may be situate to enter in lieu thereof, for
the benefit of the school fund of the township in which such
land so as aforesaid settled or occupied may be, and without
charge, an equal amount of such surveyed lands, subject either
to private entry or preemption, in the same land district as they
may select.
"And as in duty bound your memorialists will ever pray."
In response to this memorial Congress passed the following
joint resolution, March 3, 1857, 11 Stat. 251:

MINNESOT4 v. HITCHCOCK.
Statement of the Case.

"That where any settlements, by the erection of a dwelling
house or the cultivation of any portion of the land, shall have
been or shall be made upon the sixteenth or thirty-sixth sections (which sections have been reserved by law for the purpose of being applied to the support of schools in the Territories
of Minnesota, Kansas and Nebraska, and in the States and Territories hereafter to be erected out of the same) before the said
sections shall have been or shall be surveyed; or when such sections have been or may be selected or occupied as townsites,
under and by virtue of the act of Congress approved twentythird of May, eighteen hundred and forty-four, or reserved for
public uses before the survey, then other lands shall be selected
by the proper authorities, in lieu thereof, agreeably to the provisions of the act of Congress approved twentieth May, eighteen
hundred and twenty-six, entitled ' An act to appropriate lands
for the support of schools in certain townships and fractional
townships not before provided for.' And if such settler can
bring himself, or herself, within the provisions of the act of
fourth of September, eighteen hundred and forty-one, or the
occupants of the townsite be enabled to show a compliance with
the provisions of the law of twenty-third of May, eighteen hundred and forty-four, then the right of preference granted by the
said acts, in the purchase of such portion of the sixteenth or
thirty-sixth sections, so settled and occupied, shall be in them
respectively, as if such sections had not been previously reserved
for school purposes."
On February 26, 1857, Congress passed an act authorizing
the formation of a state government. 11 Stat. 166. Section 5,
so far as is applicable, is as follows:
"And be it further enacted, That the following propositions
be, and the same are hereby, offered to the said convention of
the people of Minnesota for their free acceptance or rejection,
which, if accepted by the convention, shall be obligatory on the
United States and upon the said State of Minnesota, to wit:
"First, That sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six in every
township of public lands in said State, and where either of said
sections, or any part thereof, has been sold or otherwise been
disposed of, other lands, equivalent thereto and as contiguous
as may be, shall be granted to said State for the use of schools."

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
Statement of the Case.

On October 13, 1857, a constitution was formed, in which, by
section 3 of article 2 the foregoing proposition was accepted in
this language:
"The propositions contained in the act of Congress entitled
'An act to authorize the people of the Territory of Minnesota
to form a constitution and state government, preparatory to
their admission into the Union on an equal footing with the
original States,' are hereby accepted, ratified and confirmed,
and shall remain irrevocable without the consent of the United
States; and it is hereby ordained that this State shall never
interfere with the primary disposal of the soil within the same,
by the United States, or with any regulations Congress may find
necessary for securing the title to said soil to bonajidepurchasers
thereof; and no tax shall be imposed on lands belonging to the
United States, and in no case shall non-resident proprietors be
taxed higher than residents."
By an act of date May 11, 1858, 11 Stat. 285, Minnesota was
admitted into the Union. In that it was recited "that the State
of Minnesota shall be one, and is hereby declared to be one, of
the United States of America, and admitted into the Union on
an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever."
At the date of this admission a large part of the territory in
the northwestern part of the State, including the tracts in controversy, was and for a long time thereafter remained unceded
Indian lands, subject to the Indian title of occupancy. It was,
among other things, stipulated in the agreed statement:
"That except as its status may have been affected or changed
by the treaty of October 2, 1863, 13 Stat. 667, by the President's order of March 18, 1879, enlarging what was then known
as the White Earth Indian reservation, by the act of Congress
of January 11, 1889, 25 Stat. 642, or by the act of Congress of
June 2, 1890, 26 Stat. 126, or by one or more of these, the district or country embracing the lands in controversy continued
to be unceded Indian lands subject to the original right of occupancy of the Chippewa Indians up to the time of the action
had on March 4, 1890, under the said act of January 14, 1889."
Referring to the matter stated in this stipulation, it may be

_AIINNESO":'-

Statement of the Case.

noticed that by the treaty of October 2, 1863, the Red Lake and
Pembina bands of Chippewa Indians dwelling in northwestern
Minnesota ceded lands within certain defined boundaries to the
United States, and in article 6 of the treaty the portion of the
territory occupied by them and not ceded is spoken of as a reservation, for by it the President was required to appoint a board
of visitors, "whose duty it shall be to attend at all annuity payments of the said Chippewa Indians, to inspect their fields and
other improvements, and to report annually thereon on or before the first day of November, and also as to the qualifications
and moral deportment of all persons residing upon the reservation under the authority of law."
This tract was thereafter known as the Red Lake Indian reservation, and is referred to in the President's order of March 18,
1879, in which he bounds a proposed reservation on one side by
the "Red Lake Indian reservation." The act of June 2, 1890,
26 Stat. 126, grants to the Duluth and Winnipeg Railroad Coinpany a right of way through the "Red Lake (and other) reservations." The second section of the act provides the mode of
fixing the compensation to be paid the Indians for the right of
way, and that no right of way shall vest in the company until,
among other things, "the consent of the Indians on said reservation as to the amount of said compensation and right of way
shall have been first obtained in a manner satisfactory to the
President of the United States." On January 14, 1889, an act
was passed, 25 Stat. 642, providing for a commission to negotiate with all the bands or tribes of Chippewa Indians in Mlinnesota for the cession and relinquishment, "for the purposes and
upon the terms" stated in the act, and subject to the approval
of the President, "of all their title and interest in and to all
the reservations of said Indians in the State of Minnesota, except the White Earth and Red Lake reservations, and to all
and so much of these two reservations as in the judgment of
said commission is not required to make and fill the allotments
required by this and existing acts."
That act directed that all the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota,
"except those on the Red Lake reservation," were to be removed to and allotted lands in the White Earth reservation,

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.

and those on the Red Lake reservation were to be allotted lands
on so much of that reservation as should be reserved by the
commission for that purpose. The ceded lands were thereafter
to be surveyed, inspected, classified as agricultural or pine lands,
the latter appraised by 40-acre tracts and sold at vendue, and
the agricultural lands disposed of to actual settlers at $1.25 per
acre. The proceeds arising from the disposition of the two
classes of land were to be held and applied as directed in section 7, which reads:
"That all money accruing from the disposal of said lands in
con formity with the provisions of this act shall, after deducting
all the expenses of making the census, of obtaining the cession
and relinquishment, of making the removal and allotments, and
of completing the surveys and appraisals, in this act provided,
be placed in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of
all the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota as a permanent fund, which shall draw interest at the rate of five per
centum per annum, payable annually for the period of fifty
years, after the allotments provided for in this act have been
made, and which interest and permanent fund shall be expended
for the benefit of said Indians in manner following : One half
of said interest shall, during the said period of fifty years, except in the cases hereinafter otherwise provided, be annually
paid in cash in equal shares to the heads of families and guardians of orphan minors for their use; and one fourth of said interest shall, during the same period and with the like exception,
be annually paid in cash in equal shares per capita to all other
classes of said Indians; and the remaining one fourth of said
interest shall, during the said period of fifty years, under the
direction of the Secretary of the Interior, be devoted exclusively
to the establishment and maintenance of a system of free schools
among said Indians, in their midst and for their benefit ; ad
at the expiration of the said fifty years, the said permanent
fund shall be divided and paid to all of said Chippewa Indians
and their issue then living, in cash, in equal shares: Provided,
That Congress may, in its discretion, from time to time, during
the said period of fifty years, appropriate, for the purpose of
promoting civilization and self-support among the said Indians,

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
Statement of the Case.

a portion of said principal sum, not exceeding five per centum
thereof. The United States shall, for the beneft of said Indi
ans, advance to them as such interest as aforesaid the sum of
ninety thousand dollars annually, counting from the time when
the removal and allotments provided for in this act shall have
been made until such time as said permanent fund, exclusive of
the deductions hereinbefore provided for, shall equal or exceed
the sum of three million dollars, less any actual interest that
may in the meantime accrue from accumulations of said permanent fund; the payments of such interest to be made yearly in
advance, and, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior,
may, as to three fourths thereof, during the first five years be
expended in procuring live stock, teams, farming implements,
and seed for such of the Indians, to the extent of their shares,
as are fit and desire to engage in farming, but as to the rest,
in cash; and whenever said permanent fund shall exceed the
sum of three million dollars the United States shall be fully
reimbursed out of such excess for all the advances of interest
made as herein contemplated and other expenses hereunder."
Under this act a commission was appointed and an agreement
made with the Indians for a cession of a large part of the Red
Lake Indian reservation, which agreement was approved by the
President, March 4, 1890, the unceded portion being reserved
by the commissioners "for the purpose of making and filling
the allotments" provided for in the act.
According to the agreed statement of facts the lands in the
reservation were wholly unsurveyed at the time of the passage
of this last act, January 11, 1889, and until after the approval
of the agreement for this cession, March 4, 1890. â¢
On February 28, 1891, 26 Stat. 796, Congress passed this act:
"Where settlements with a view to preemption or homestead
have been or shall hereafter be made, before the survey of the
lands in the field, which are found to have been made on sections sixteen or thirty-six, those sections shall be subject to the
claims of such settlers; and if such sections, or either of them,
have been or shall be granted, reserved, or pledged for the use
of schools or colleges in the State or Territory in which they
lie, other lands of equal acreage are hereby appropriated and

Statement of the Case.

granted, and may be selected by said State or Territory, in lieu
of such as may be thus taken by preemption or homestead settlers. And other lands of equal acreage are also hereby appropriated and granted, and may be selected by said State or
Territory, where sections sixteen or thirty-six are mineral land,
or are included within any Indian, military, or other reservation, or are otherwise disposed of by the United States: Provided, Where any State is entitled to said sections sixteen and
thirty-six, or where said sections are reserved to any Territory,
notwithstanding the same may be mineral land or embraced
within a military, Indian, or other reservation, the selection of
such lands in lieu thereof by said State or Territory shall be a
waiver of its right to said sections. And other lands of equal
acreage are also hereby appropriated and granted, and may be
selected by said State or Territory to compensate deficiencies
for school purposes, where sections sixteen or thirty-six are
fractional in quantity, or where one or both are wanting by
reason of the township being fractional, or from any natural
cause whatever. And it shall be the duty of the Secretary of
the Interior, without awaiting the extension of the public surveys, to ascertain and determine, by protraction or otherwise,
the number of townships that will be included within such Indian, military, or other reservations, and thereupon the State
or Territory shall be entitled to select indemnity lands to the
extent of two sections for each of said townships, in lieu of sections sixteen and thirty-six therein; but such selections may not
be made within the boundaries of said reservations: Provided,
however, That nothing herein contained shall prevent any State
or Territory from awaiting the extinguishment of any such
military, Indian, or other reservation and the restoration of the
lands therein embraced to the public domain and then taking
the sections sixteen and thirty-six in place therein; but nothing
in this proviso shall be construed as conferring any right not
now existing."
Upon these facts the State contends that the territory in question was not an Indian reservation, but what is known as unceded Indian country, subject to the original right of occupancy
by the Ohippewa Indians, and also that whether the country

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
Statement of the Case.

was an Indian reservation or unceded Indian country it was subject to the grant of sections 16 and 36 to the State when the
Indian right of occupancy was extinguished.
Defendants' contentions are:
1. That this tract of country was a reservation, set apart and
appropriated to the uses of the civilization and support of the
Indians.
2. That these lands never became "public lands," and so
never became subject to the State's school land grant.
3. That the school land grant attached to no particular lands
until surveyed. Until then the specific sections remained subject to disposition by Congress, the State, in the event of such
disposition, being remitted to the selection of other lands as indemnity. Especially did the joint resolution of March 3, 1857,
subject these sections in Minnesota to reservation for public uses
at any time before survey, and, in the event of any such reservation, make the State's grant, to that extent, one of indemnity
lands.
4. That the act of January 14, 1889, and the agreement negotiated thereunder with the Indians, dedicated and appropriated
all the lands in the Red Lake reservation exclusively to the civilization, education and support of the Indians. This was a disposal of the lands within the meaning of the enabling act of February 26, 1857, and in any event was a reservation of them for
public uses under the joint resolution of March 3, 1857.
5. That in interpreting the act of 1889, it is of no moment
that the State has a system of common schools aided by a
grant of lands from the General Government. That act in
terms keeps the education of these Indians under national control, and dedicates a portion of the proceeds of the sale of these
lands "exclusively to the establishment and maintenance of a
system of free schools among said Indians, in their midst and
for their benefit."
6. That in determining whether the act of. 1889 and the
agreement negotiated thereunder were intended to appropriate
sections 16 and 36, along with the other lands, to the civilization, education and support of the Indians, inquiry must be
made as to how the act and agreement were understood by the
Indians.

MR.

JUSTICE

BRiEWr delivered the opinion of the court.

A preliminary question is one of jurisdiction. It is true
counsel for defendants did not raise the question, and evidently
both parties desire that the court should ignore it and dispose
of the case on the merits. But the silence of counsel does not
waive the question, nor would the express consent of the parties give to this court a jurisdiction which was not warranted
by the Constitution and laws. It is the duty of every court of
its own motion to inquire into the matter irrespective of the
wishes of the parties, and be careful that it exercises no powers
save those conferred by law. Consent may waive an objection
so far as respects the person, but it cannot invest a court with a
jurisdiction which it does not by law possess over the subject
matter. The question having been suggested by the court, a
brief has been presented, and our jurisdiction sought to be sustained on several grounds. The question is one of the original
and not of the appellate jurisdiction. The pertinent constitutional provisions are found in section 2 of article III, as follows:
"The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and
equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United
States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their
authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction - to controversies to which the United States shall be a
party; to controversies between two or more States; between
a State and citizens of another State; between citizens of different States; between citizens of the same State claiming lands
under grants of different States, and between a State or the
citizens thereof and foreign States, citizens or subjects.
"In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
Opinion of the Court.

and consuls, and those in which a State shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other
cases before mentioned the Supreme Court shall have appellate
jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and
under such regulations as the Congress shall make."
The first of these paragraphs defines the matters to which
the judicial power of the United States extends, and the second
divides the original and appellate jurisdiction of this court. By
the latter paragraph this court is given original jurisdiction of
those cases "in which a State shall be a party." This paragraph, distributing the original and appellate jurisdiction of
this court, is not to be taken as enlarging the judicial power of
the United States or adding to the cases or matters to which
by the first paragraph the judicial power is declared to extend.
The question is, therefore, not finally settled by the fact that
the State of Minnesota is a party to this litigation. It must
also appear that the case is one to which by the first paragraph
the judicial power of the United States extends. There are
three clauses in the first paragraph which call for notice; one,
that which extends the judicial power of the United States to
controversies "between a State and citizens of another State;"
second, that which extends it "to all cases in law and equity
arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States,
and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;" and, third, that which extends it to controversies "to
which the United States shall be a party." To bring the case
within the first clause referred to, the bill alleges that the defendant, Ethan Allen Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior, is a
citizen of Missouri, and the defendant, Binger Herman, Commissioner of the General Land Office, a citizen of Oregon, and
therefore it is said the case comes strictly within the language
of the first paragraph in that there is presented a controversy
between a State, Minnesota, and citizens of other States. To
that it may be replied that there is no real controversy between
the State, the plaintiff, and the defendants as individuals; that
the latter, merely as citizens, have no interest in the controversy for or against the plaintiff; that in case either of the
defendants should die or resign and a citizen of Minnesota be

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

appointed in his place, the jurisdiction of the court would cease,
and this although the real parties in interest remain the same.
In respect to the second it may be said that if it were held that
this court had original jurisdiction of every case of a justiciable nature in which a State was a party and in which was
presented some question arising under the Constitution, laws
of the United States, or treaties made under their authority,
many cases, both of a legal and an equitable nature, in respect
to which Congress has provided no suitable procedure, would
be brought within its cognizance. To this it may be replied
that this court cannot deny its jurisdiction in a case to which
it is extended by the Constitution. As to the third, it may be
objected that the United States is not in terms a party to the
litigation and has no pecuniary interest in the controversy, it
being in reality one between the State and the Indians.
We omit, as unnecessary to the disposition of this case, any
consideration of the applicability of the first two clauses, because we think the case comes within the scope of the third
clause, and we need not now go further. This is a controversy
to which the United States may be regarded as a party. It is
one, therefore, to which the judicial power of the United States
extends. It is, of course, under that clause a matter of indifference whether the United States is a party plaintiff or defendant. It could not fairly be adjudged that the judicial power
of the United States extends to those cases in which the United
States is a party plaintiff and does not extend to those cases in
which it is a party defendant.
The case of United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621, is in point,
and upon many aspects of the question very suggestive. That
was a suit brought by the United States against the State of
Texas to determine the title to a tract, called the county of
Greer, which was claimed by the State to be within its limits
and a part of its territory, and by the United States to be outside the State of Texas and belonging to the United States.
The jurisdiction of this court was challenged, but was sustained.
After referring to the provisions of the Constitution and the
judiciary act of 1789, Mr. Justice tarlan, speaking for the court,
said:

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
Opinion of the Court.

"The words in the Constitution, 'in all cases .
.
in
which a State shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have
original jurisdiction,' necessarily refer to all cases mentioned

in the preceding clause in which a State may be made, of right,
a party defendant, or in which a State may, of right, be a party
plaintiff.
"It is, however, said that the words last quoted refer only to
suits in which a State is a party, and in which, also, the opposite party is another State of the Union or a foreign State.
This cannot be correct, for it must be conceded that a State
can bring an original suit in this court against a citizen of another State. Wisconsin v. Pelican ns. Co., 127 U. S.265, 287.
Besides, unless a State is exempt altogether from suit by the
United States, we do not perceive upon what sound rule of construction suits brought by the United States in this courtespecially if they be suits the correct decision of which depends
upon the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United Statesare to be excluded from its original jurisdiction as defined by
the Constitution. That instrument extends the judicial power
of the United States 'to all cases,' in law and equity, arising
under the Constitution, laws and treaties of the United States,
and to controversies in which the United States shall be a party,
and confers upon this court original jurisdiction 'in all cases'
Iin which a State shall be party,' that is, in all cases mentioned
in the preceding clause in which a State may, of right, be made
a party defendant, as well as in all cases in which a State may,
of right, institute a suit in a court of the United States. The
present case is of the former class. We cannot assume that the
framers of the Constitution, while extending the judicial power
of the .United States to controversies between two or more
States of the Union, and between a State of the Union and
foreign States, intended to exempt a State altogether from suit
by the General Government. They could not have overlooked
the possibility that controversies, capable of judicial solution,
might arise between the United States and some of the States,
and that the permanence of the Union might be endangered if
to some tribunal was not entrusted the power to determine
VOL. CLXxxv-25

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

them according to the recognized principles of law. And to
what tribunal could a trust so momentous be more appropriately
committed than to that which the people of the United States,
in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice and insure domestic tranquillity, have constituted with authority to
speak for all the people and all the States, upon questions before it to which the judicial power of the nation extends? It
would be difficult to suggest any reason why this court should
have jurisdiction to determine questions of boundary between
two or more States, but not jurisdiction of controversies of like
character between the United States and a State." (p. 643.)
While the United States as a government may not be sued
without its consent, yet with its consent it may be sued, and
the judicial power of the United States extends to such a controversy. Indeed, the whole jurisdiction of the Court of Claims
rests upon this proposition.
It may be said that the United States is not named as defendant, and therefore it cannot be considered a party to the
controversy. It is true that it was at one time held that the
Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
which provides that "the judicial power of the United States
shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity
commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by
citizens of another State, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign State," was applicable only to cases in which the State
was named in the record as a party defendant. Osborn v.
United States Bank, 9 Wheat. '738. But later rulings have
modified that decision, and held that the amendment applies to
any suit brought in name against an officer of the State, when
"the State, though not named, is the real party against which
the relief is asked, and the judgment will operate." In i'e
Ayers, 123 U. S.443. Of course, this statement has no reference to and does'not include those cases in which officers of
the United States are sued, in appropriate form, to compel them
to perform some ministerial duty imposed upon them by law,
and which they wrongfully neglect or refuse to perform. Such
suits would not be deemed suits against the United States within
the rule that the Government cannot be sued except by its consent, nor within the rule established in the Ayers case.

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
Opinion of the Court.

Now, the legal title to these lands is in the United States.
The officers named as defendants have no interest in the lands
or the proceeds thereof. The United States is proposing to
sell them. This suit seeks to restrain the United States from
such sale, to divest the Government of its title and vest it in
the State. The United States is, therefore, the real party affected by the judgment and against which in fact it will operate, and the officers have no pecuniary interest in the matter.
If whether a suit is one against a State is to be determined, not
by the fact of the party named as defendant on the record, but
by the result of the judgment or decree which may be entered,
the same rule must apply to the United States. The question
whether the United States is a party to a controversy is not
determined by the merely nominal party on the record but by
the question of the effect of the judgment or decree which can
be entered.
But, it may be said, that the United States has no substantial
interest in the lands; that it holds the legal title under a contract with the Indians and in trust for their benefit. This is
undoubtedly true, and if the case stood alone upon the construction of the treaty between the United States and the Indians
there might be substantial force in this suggestion. But Congress has, for the Government, assumed a personal responsibility. On March 2, 1901, it passed the following act:
"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in

any suit heretofore or hereafter instituted in the Supreme Court
of the United States to determine the right of a State to what
are commonly known as school lands within any Indian reservation or any Indian cession where an Indian tribe claims any
right to or interest in the lands in controversy, or in the disposition thereof by the United States, the right of such State may
be fully tested and determined without making the Indian tribe,
or any portion thereof, a party to the suit, if the Secretary of
the Interior is made a party thereto; and the duty of representing and defending the right or interest of the Indian tribe,
or any portion thereof, in the matter shall devolve upon the
Attorney General upon the request of such Secretary." 31
Stat. 950.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

It has by this legislation in effect declared that the Indians,
although the real parties in interest, need not be made parties to
the suit; that the United States will, for the purposes of the litigation, stand as the real party in interest, and so far as it could
within constitutional limits has expressed the consent of the
Government to the maintenance of this suit in this court. By
the act it, in effect, declares that it waives all objections on the
ground that it is a mere trustee; that it assumes the full responsibilities of ownership, and that it will, whatever may be
the outcome of any litigation, stand responsible to the Indians
for the full value of the lands in controversy. Can the court
say that the United States may not assume such responsibility;
may not waive all objections on account of the mere matter of
trusteeship, and stand in court as the responsible owner, against
whom all litigation may be directed? If it stands as such
owner, then within the proposition heretofore referred to a
suit which is against its agents, not affecting them individually,
but affecting only its title to the real estate, is in substance and
effect a suit against the United States. The controversy is
made by the act of 1901 one to which the United States is a
party in interest, to be directly affected by the result, and, therefore, the case is within the first paragraph, as one to which the
judicial power of the United States extends.
Our conclusion, therefore, is that the original jurisdiction
vested by the Constitution in this court over controversies in
which a State is a party is not affected by. the question whether
the State is party plaintiff or party defendant; that a dispute
as to the title to real estate is a question of a justiciable nature,
and can properly be determined in a judicial proceeding; and
that the United States is to be taken, for the purposes of this
case, as the real party in interest adverse to the State. We are
of opinion, therefore, that this court has jurisdiction of this controversy, and is called upon to determine the case upon its
merits.
We pass, therefore, to a, consideration of such merits.
Whether this tract, which -wasknown as the Red Lake Indian
reservation, was properly called a reservation, as the defendant
contends, or unceded Indian country, as the plaintiff insists, is

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
Opinion of the Court.

a matter of little moment. Confessedly the fee of the land
was in the United States, subject to a right of occupancy by
the Indians. That fee the Government might convey, and
whenever the Indian right of occupancy was terminated (if
such termination was absolute and unconditional) the grantee
of the fee would acquire a perfect and unburdened title and
right of possession. At the same time, the Indians' right of
occupancy has always been held to be sacred; something not
to be taken from him except by his consent, and then upon such
consideration as should be agreed upon.
It is true that in the third division of the agreed statement
there is a stipulation that the territory embraced within the socalled Red Lake Indian reservation remained unceded Indian
lands, up to the action had on March 4, 1890, unless its status
was affected by certain matters named. Doubtless its status,
if by that is meant simply the character of the title, was not
affected by those matters. While its boundaries were indicated,
while it was called the Red Lake Indian reservation, yet the
acts referred to did not purport to change the rights of the Indians or the Government, neither did they in fact change them.
The land remained on March 4, 1890, land the fee of which was
in the United States, but subject to the Chippewa Indians' right
of occupancy. No patent had ever been executed by the United States to the Indians in severalty or to the tribe at large.
The mere calling of the tract a reservation instead of unceded
Indian lands did not change the title. It was simply a convenient way of designating the tract.
Yet if it was necessary to determine the question we should
have little doubt that this was a reservation within the accepted
meaning of the term. Prior to the treaty of October 2, 1863,
the boundaries of the lands occupied by the Chippewa Indians
bad been defined by sundry treaties, and by that treaty a large
portion of the lands thus occupied were ceded by the Indians;
that is, the Indians ceded to the United States all their interest
and right of possession. While there was no formal action in
respect to the remaining tract, the effect was to leave the Indians in a distinct tract reserved for their occupation, and in
the same act this tract was spoken of as a reservation. Now,

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

in order to create a reservation it is not necessary that there
should be a formal cession or a formal act setting apart a particular tract. It is enough that from what has been (lone there
results a certain defined tract appropriated to certain purposes.
Here the Indian occupation was confined by the treaty to a
certain specified tract. That became, in effect, an Indian reservation. Spaldiug v. akandler, 160 U. S. 394, is in point.
There, as here, was presented the question of the origin of a
reservation, and in respect thereto it was said (pp. 403, 404):
"It is not necessary to determine how the reservation of the
particular tract, subsequently known as the ' Indian reserve,'
came to be made. It is clearly inferable from the evidence
contained in the record that at the time of the maling of the
treaty of June 16, 1820, the Chippewa tribe of Indians were in
the actual occupation and use of this Indian reserve as an encampment for the pursuit of fishing. . . . But whether
the Indians simply continued to encamp where they had been
accustomed to prior to making the treaty of 1820, whether a
selection of the tract, afterwards known as the Indian reserve,
was made by the Indians subsequent to the making of the treaty
and acquiesced in by-the United States Government, or whether
the selection was made by the Government and acquiesced in by
the Indians, is immaterial. . . . If the reservation was free
from objection by the Government, it was as effectual as though
the particular tract to be used was specifically designated by
boundaries in the treaty itself. The reservation thus created
stood precisely in the same category as other Indian reservations, whether established for general or limited uses, and
whether made by the direct authority of Congress in the ratification of a treaty or indirectly through the medium of a duly
authorized executive officer."
Turning to the legislation of Congress in respect to school
lands in Minnesota, the clause in the act establishing the territorial government has only this significance. It provided that
when the lands in the Territory should be surveyed sections
Nos. 16 and 36 "shall be and the same are hereby reserved,"
for the purpose of being applied to schools. But the agreed
statement shows that these lands were not surveyed until after

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
Opinion of the Court.

the act of January 14, 1889, and the agreement with the Indians made in pursuance thereof, and approved by the President, March 4, 1900. Further, the State had been admitted
into the Union, and the rights of the State are to be determined by the act of admission rather than by any prior declaration by Congress of its purpose in respect to certain lands.
The act of admission provided:
"That sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six in every
township of public lands in said State, and where either of
said sections or any part thereof has been sold or otherwise
been disposed of, other lands, equivalent thereto and as contiguous as may be, shall be granted to said State for the use
of schools."
It will be perceived that this grant was of " public lands."
It was held in -Newhallv. Sanger, 92 U. S. 761, 763, that"The words ' public lands ' are habitually used in our legislation to describe such as are subject to sale or other disposal
under general laws."
In Leavenworth &o. Railroad Co. v. United States, 92 U. S.
733, 741, speaking of a grant to the State of Kansas in aid of
the construction of a railway, as affecting lands within an Indian
reservation, it was said:
"But did Congress intend that it should reach these lands?
Its general terms neither include nor exclude them. Every
alternate section designated by odd numbers, within certain
defined limits, is granted; but only the public lands owned
absolutely by the United States are subject to survey and division into sections, and to them alone this grant is applicable. It
embraces such as could be sold and enjoyed, and not those which
the Indians, pursuant to treaty stipulations, were left free to
occupy."
In Missouri, l-ansas & Texas Railway Co. v. Roberts, 152
U. S.114, 119, are these words, referring to the reservation of
sections 16 and 36 to Kansas as school lands:
"If the reservation named was intended as a grant of the
sections sixteen (16) and thirty-six (36) to the Territory and to
the States to be created out of them, or as a dedication of them
for schools, it could only apply to such lands as were public

OCTOBER TERM1, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

lands, for no other lands in our land system are subdivided into
sections, nor could it embrace lands which had been set apart
and reserved by statute or treaty with them for the use of the
Indians, as was the case with the lands involved in this controversy, as we have already shown."
See also Doolan v. Car', 125 U. S. 618, 632; Bctrdon v. Northern Pacifc Railroad Co., 145 U. S.535, 538; -Mannv. Tacoma
Land Co., 153 U. S. 273, 284; Barker v. Marvey, 181 U. S.
481,490.
Again, the language of the section does not imply a grant
hal
iq )
It is " ,s
l be granted." Doubtless under that
promise whenever lands became public lands they came within
the scope of the grant. As said in Beech er v. letlierby, 95 U. S.
517, 523, with reference to a similar clause in the act for the
admission of Wisconsin into the Union:
"It was, therefore, an unalterable condition of the admission,
obligatory upon the United States, that section sixteen (16) in
every township of the public lands in the State, which had not
been sold or otherwise disposed of, should be granted to the State
for the use of schools. It matters not whether the words of the
compact be considered as merely promissory on the part of the
United States, and constituting only a pledge of a grant in
future, or as operating to transfer the title to the State upon her
acceptance of the propositions as soon as the sections could be
afterwards identified by the public surveys. In either case, the
lands which might be embraced within those sections were appropriated to the State. They were withdrawn from any other
disposition, and set apart from the public domain, so that no
subsequent law authorizing a sale of it could be construed to
embrace them, although they were not specially excepted."
And again, in Mzited States v. Tioynas, 151 U. 5. 577, 583:
"Mr. Justice Lamar, while Secretary of the Interior, had
frequent occasion to consider the nature and effect of the grant
of school lands, where the title was at all encumbered or doubtful; and on this subject he said (6 L. Dec. 418) that the true
theory was this: 'That where the fee is in the United States
at the date of survey, and the land is so encumbered that full
and complete title and right of possession cannot then vest in

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
Opinion of the Court.

the State, the State may, if it so desires, elect to take equivalent lands in fulfillment of the compact, or it may wait until
the right and title of possession unite in the Government, and
then satisfy its grant by taking the lands specifically granted.'
And this view he considered ' as fully sustained by the decisions
of the courts and the opinions of the Attorneys General,' and
cited in support of it Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173; 3 Opins.
56; 8 Opins. 255; 9 Opins. 346; 16 Opins. 430; Ham v. iXissouri, 18 How. 126."
So also in Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, 179, the question
presented was whether certain mineral lands were excepted
from the grant of school lands to the State. The words of the
school land grant were, as here, "shall be granted," and it was
said
"We agree, that until the survey of the township and the
designation of the specific section, the right of the State rests
in compact-binding, it is true, the public faith, and dependent
for execution upon the political authorities. Courts of justice
have no authority to mark out and define the land which shall
be subject to the grant. But when the political authorities have
performed this duty, the compact has an object, upon which it
can attach, and if there is no legal impediment the title of the
State becomes a legal title. The jus ad rem by the performance
of that executive act becomes ajus in re, judicial in its nature,
and under the cognizance and protection of the judicial authorities, as well as the others. Gaines v. Nicholson, 9 How.
356."
But while this is true it is also true that Congress does not,
by the section making the school land grant, either in letter or
spirit, bind itself to remove all burdens which may rest upon
lands belonging to the Government within the State, or to transform all from their existing status to that of public lands, strictly
so called, in order that the school grant may operate upon the
sections named. It is, of course, to be presumed that Congress
will act in good faith; that it will not attempt to impair the
scope of the school grant; that it intends that the State shall
receive the particular sections or their equivalent in aid of its
public school system. But considerations may arise which will

OCTOBER TERMi, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

justify an appropriation of a body of lands within the State to
other purposes, and if those lands have never become public
lands the power of Congress to deal with them is not restricted
by the school grant, and the State must seek relief in the clause
which gives it equivalent sections. If, for instance, Congress
in its judgment believes that within the limits of an Indian reservation or unceded Indian country-that is, within a tract
which is not strictly public lands-certain lands should be set
apart for a public park, or as a reservation for military purposes, or for any other public uses, it has the power notwithstanding the provisions of the school grant section. So it is that
when Congress came in 1889 to make provision for this body of
lands it could have by treaty taken simply a cession of the Indian rights of occupancy, and thereupon the lands would have
become public lands and within the scope of the school grant.
But it also had the power to make arrangements with the Indians by the which the entire tract would be otherwise appropriated.
What was in fact done? The act of January 14, 1889, provided for a commission to negotiate for the cession and relinquishment of "all and so much of" the White Earth and Red
Lake reservations as in the judgment of the commission should
not be required to satisfy the allotments required by the existing acts, the cession to be "for the purposes and upon the
terms hereinafter stated." The allotments referred to were
allotments in severalty, made in conformity to the provisions
of the act of February 8, 188(. 24 Stat. 388. The ceded lands
were to be divided into two classes; one appraised and sold at
auction and the other disposed of to actual settlers at $1.25 per
acre. The proceeds of these sales were to be placed in the
Treasury of the United States as a permanent fund to the
credit of the Indians, drawing interest at five per centum for
fifty years, the interest to be expended, three fourths paid in
cash to the Indians severally and the remaining one fourth devoted, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, "exclusively to the establishment and maintenance of a system of
free schools among said Indians in their midst and for their
benefit." The cession was not to the United States absolutely,

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
Opinion of the Court.

but in trust. It was a cession of all of the unallotted lands.
The trust was to be executed by the sale of the ceded lands
and a deposit of the proceeds in the Treasury of the United
States to the credit of the Indians, such sum to draw interest
at five per cent, and one fourth of the interest to be devoted
exclusively to the maintenance of free schools among the Indians and for their benefit.
Now it is contended that this legislation, though dealing with,
in terms, all the unallotted lands, is subordinated to the prior
promise of the Government to grant sections 16 and 36 to the
State for school purposes. In other words, the cession and relinquishment by the Indians, it is said, extend to all the unallotted lands, but that cession and relinquishment having been
accomplished, the trust which by the same legislation is created
in respect to the same lands is limited, and restricted by the
prior promise of the Government, and this notwithstanding the
fact that the Government had provided that the State might
take other lands, in case any particular sections 16 and 36 had
become approprinted to other public uses. We are not disposed
to belittle this contention. The arguments in favor of it, both
those founded on technical rules of statutory construction and
those based upon the long-established policies of the Government
in respect to both the Indians and the public schools, are presented by counsel for the State with exceeding force and ability.
Notwithstanding this, we are constrained to believe that not
only the technical rules of statutory construction, but also the
general scope of the legislation in these matters, and the policy
of the United States in respect to public schools, and also to
Indians, as the wards of Government, concur in sustaining the
contention of the Government that none of these ceded lands
passed under the school grant to the State.
And first, in reference to technical rules of statutory construction. The cession was, as we have seen, of all the unallotted
lands, and the cession was of those lands "for the purposes
and upon the terms hereinafter stated." It was a distinct conveyance by the Indians of certain lands for a named purpose.
Now if the United States, the recipient of this cession, was
competent to carry into execution the expressed purposes, does

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

it not follow that the cession subjected all the lands to them?
Can it be said that the Indians, making the cession, for a moment supposed that the lands ceded were not to be used for
the purposes named, and if the language carries upon its face
one obvious meaning, and would naturally be so understood by
the Indians, that construction within all the rules respecting
Indian treaties must be enforced. As said in lorcesterv. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 582:
"The language used in treaties with the Indians should never
be construed to their prejudice. If words be made use of which
are susceptible of a more extended meaning than their plain
import, as connected with the tenor of the treaty, they should
be considered as used only in the latter sense. To contend that
the word 'allotted,' in reference to the land guaranteed to the
Indians in certain treaties, indicates a favor conferred rather
than a right acknowledged, would, it would seem to me, do
injustice to the understanding of the parties. Hlow the words
of the treaty were understood by this unlettered people, rather
than their critical meaning, should form the rule of construction."
And in Choctaw Nratioi v. United States, 119 U. S. 1, 28:
"The recognized relation between the parties to this controversy, therefore, is that between a superior and an inferior,
whereby the latter is placed under the care and control of the
former, and which, while it authorizes the adoption on the part
of the United States of such policy as their own public interests
may dictate, recognizes, on the other hand, such an interpretation of their acts and promises as justice and reason demand in
all cases where power is exerted by the strong over those to
whom they owe care and protection. The parties are not on
an equal footing, and that inequality is to be made good by
the superior justice which looks only to the substance of the
right, without regard to technical rules framed under a system
of municipal jurisprudence, formulating the rights and obligations of private persons equally subject to the same laws."
But reliance is placed upon the doctrine that a later general
statute does not repeal by implication a prior special statute
unless there is an absolute incompatibility between the two,

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.

Opinion of the Court.

and the earlier will remain as an exception to the later. It is
said that here the earlier statute was a special grant or promise
to grant two particular sections in each township; the later a
general statute in respect to all of a large body of lands. There
is no necessary incompatibility between the two, and the earlier
should be taken as an exception to the later and the later held
applicable to all the lands except the specially named sections.
Beecher v. Wi-etl/ery, supra, is referred to as an illustration of
the doctrine and in point in reference to school lands. But in
that case the cession from the Indians was not subject to any
trust. The facts were these: The action was replevin to recover
logs cut upon a particular section, and the title to the logs depended on the title to the land. The Wisconsin school grant, in
1846, though of only section 16, was in form similar to that to
Minnesota, and the defendant claimed under that grant. A
treaty had been concluded with the Menomonees, February 8,
1831, containing a provision that two specified townships should
be set apart for the use of the Stockbridge and Munsee Indians.
In these townships was the section 16 in controversy. By
treaty, ratified January 23, 1849, the Menomonees, in consideration of the sum of $350,000 and a reservation west of the
Mississippi, agreed to cede all their lands in Wisconsin. The
eighth article of the treaty stipulated that they should be permitted to remain on the ceded lands for two years and until
notified by the President that the lands were wanted. By
treaty of May 12, 1854, this proposed reservation west of the
Mississippi River was retroceded by the Indians to the United
States, and in consideration of such cession the United States
agreed to give them a home, "to be held as Indian lands are held,"
upon Wolf River, in Wisconsin, which tract included the townships set apart for the benefit of the Stockbridge and Munsee
Indians. On February 6, 1871, Congress passed an act for the
sale of these two townships, except eighteen contiguous sections
thereof, and the appropriation of the proceeds for the benefit
of the Stockbridge and Munsee Indians, and in pursuance of
that act the United States sold the land in controversy to the
plaintiff. The court held that the title of the defendant under
the school grant was superior to that of the plaintiff under the

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

sale by the United States. Two facts are apparent: First, the
Menomonee Indians in the first instance received a cash and
real estate consideration for the large reservation which they
conveyed to the United States; second, that while thereafter
a tract was ceded to them to be held as Indian lands are held
-a tract which included the section in controversy-and while
by an earlier treaty with the Menomonees two townships of
such tract (including this particular section 16) had been set
apart for the use and benefit of the Stockbridge and Munsee
Indians, yet there appears no treaty or agreement with either
the Menomonee or Stockbridge or Munsee Indians in reference
to the sale of these two townships. Yet, as stated by the
court, "when the logs in suit were cut, those tribes had removed from the land in controversy, and other sections had
been set apart for their occupation." The ruling was that the
United States held the fee, subject only to the Indian right of
occupancy; that by the school land section in the enabling act
there was a grant, or promise to grant,-in either event to be
taken as an appropriation of the fee to the State, subject to the
Indian right of occupancy; that the Indians had removed from
the lands and had received other lands for their occupation;
that hence, all Indian rights had ceased. The court, quoting
in its opinion from United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591, said
(p. 593): "The right of the Indians to their occupancy is as
sacred as that of the United States to the fee, but it is only a
right of occupancy. The possession, when abandoned by the
Indians attaches itself to the fee without further grant."
Hence, applying the doctrine in respect to earlier special and
later general statutes, the Government having received from
the Indians their right of occupancy, without any stipulation
or agreement or trust in respect thereto, it was held that the
act providing for the sale of the two townships could not have
been intended to authorize a sale of specific sections therein
which had been already conveyed or promised to the State.
But this case stands on entirely different grounds. Before any
survey of the lands, before the state right had attached to any
particular sections, the United States made a treaty or agreement with the Indians, by which they accepted a cession of the

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.

Opinion of the Court.

entire tract under a trust for its disposition in a particular way.
The question is not as to the construction of two separate statutes, but as to the scope and effect to be given to a treaty or
agreement with the Indians, and whether it is to be narrowed
in its scope by any rules applicable to the construction of statutes-rules with which it is not to be supposed the Indians
were familiar.
Buttz v. NYorthern Pacific Railroad,119 U. S. 55, is also referred to. In that case the controversy was in respect to a
tract of land within the place limits of the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, 13 Stat. 365, and which at the
time of the filing of the map of definite location was within
the limits of an Indian reservation By the second section of the
granting act it was provided that "the United States shall extinguish, as rapidly as may be consistent with public policy and
the welfare of the said Indians, the Indian titles to all lands
falling under the operation of this act, and acquired in the donation to the (road) named in this bill." In 1872 the United
States entered into a treaty with the Indians, by which for a
cash consideration so much of the reservation as covered the
land in controversy was ceded to the United States. It was
held that by the original act the fee which was in the United
States passed to the railroad company, subject to the Indian
right of occupancy, which was afterwards, in pursuance of the
promise to the company in the granting act, extinguished for a
cash consideration, and immediately there was vested in the
company a title paramount to that of one attempting a preemption. Here then, as in the prior case, the cession by the
Indians was subject to no trust or condition, and the question
was simply as to the effect to be given to various statutes.
Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold. & Silver Xining Company, 93
U. S. 634, while not involving any question of Indian rights, is
worthy of notice, as affecting a State's claim to school lands.
The Nevada enabling act, approved March 21, 1864, 13 Stat.
30, 32, contained this provision: "That sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six in every township, and_ where such sections
have been sold or otherwise disposed of by any act of Congress,
other lands equivalent thereto, in legal subdivisions of not less

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

than one quarter section, and as contiguous as may be, shall be,
and are hereby, granted to said State for the support of common schools." The plaintiff claimed title by conveyance from
the State of a part of a section sixteen. The defendant rested
upon a mineral patent from the United States, his entry upon
the lands having been prior to any survey, and in conformity to
the miners' laws, customs and usages of the district. Although
the terms of the school land section were terms of present grant,
and although the entry by the defendant was after the State
had been admitted, yet his title was adjudged superior to that
obtained from the State, the court holding that the United
States had full power to dispose of the land until after a survey
and the identification thereby.
Again, it is well to bear in mind the joint resolution passed
by Congress on -arch 3, 1857, a resolution which was prompted
by a memorial from the legislature of the Territory of Minnesota, and which, recognizing the possibility of settlements or
townsite entries before the public surveys on lands which by
such surveys were afterwards found to be school sections, provided that when any such sections should be occupied by settlers or selected as townsites "or reserved for public uses before
the survey," then other lands might be selected in lieu thereof.
That the sale of the ceded lands for the purpose of creating a
fund for the benefit of the Indians was a use of them for a
public purpose, cannot be doubted. But the contention of
counsel for the State is "that the public uses which were intended to operate as an appropriation prior to the services wVere
uses to which the land itself might be put or employed for governmental uses." It is unnecessary to rest upon a determination
of this question. We refer to the resolution as an express declaration by Congress that the school sections were not granted
to the State absolutely and beyond any further control by
Congress, or any further action under the general land laws.
As in Heydlenfeldt v. Daney Gold & Silver Mining Co., supra,
priority was given to a mining entry over the State's school
right, so here, in terms, preference is given to private entries,
townsite entries, or reservations for public uses. In other
words, the act of admission with its clause in respect to school

MINNESOTA v. HITCHCOCK.
Opinion of the Court.

lands was not a promise by Congress that under all circumstances, either then or in the future, these specific school sections
were or should become the property of the State. The possibility of other disposition was contemplated, the right of Congress
to make it was recognized, and provision made for a selection
of other lands in lieu thereof. In this connection may also be
noticed the act of February 28, 1891, although passed after the
approval of the agreement for the cession of these lands by the
Indians. That act in terms authorized the selection of other
lands "where sections sixteen or thirty-six are mineral land, or
are included within any Indian, military, or other reservation,
or are otherwise disposed of by the United States."
We come finally to a consideration of the policy of the Government both in respect to schools and to Indians. It is undoubtedly true that such policy from the beginning has been
liberal in the appropriation of lands for school purposes. See
a review of the legislation in respect thereto in the opinion in
Cooper v. Roberts, supra.

It is not to be supposed that Congress intended any departure
from this policy in its legislation in respect to lands within Minnesota, and the courts are justified in any fair construction of
such legislation as will secure to the State its full quota of lands
for aid in the development of its public school system. It is
also true that much of the legislation in respect to Indians and
many of the treaties with them have contemplated simply the
cession of their lands and their removal to tracts further west.
In such cases, where there has been simply a cession by the Indian tribe of its reservation and a removal to some new territory, it is not strange that the school grants have been generally
held operative in the ceded reservations. The interests of public schools have always been considered paramount to those of
railroad companies in grants made to aid in their construction.
The one speaks for intellectual; the other for material development. Of course, when the Indian tribe has been removed by
treaty from one body of land to another the interest of the tribe
in the land from which it has been removed ceases and the full
obligation of the Government to the Indians is satisfied when
the pecuniary or real estate consideration for the cession is seVOL. OLXXxv-26

cured to them. But in some instances, and this is one of them,
the Indians have not been removed from one reservation to
another, but the Government has proceeded upon the theory
that the time has come when efforts shall be made to civilize
and fit them for citizenship. Allotments are made in severalty,
and something attempted more than provision for the material
wants of the Indians. In construing provisions designed for
their education and civilization as fully if not more than in construing provisions for their material wants, is it a duty to secure to the Indians all that by any fair construction of treaty
or statute can be held to have been understood by them or
intended by Congress. Instead of removing these Chippewa
Indians from Minnesota, the purpose of the legislation and
agreement was to fit them for citizenship by allotting them
lands in severalty and providing a system of public schools.
Surely it could not have been understood by the Indians that
only part of the lands they ceded were to be used for these purposes. They were dealing with the tract as an entirety, and
they had a right to expect that the entire tract would be used
as declared in the act and agreement. No provision is made
for compensating the Indians for lands which would be lost if
the rigiht of the State was sustained, whereas, on the other hand,
the right of the State to compensation for the particular school
sections within the tract had already been secured. Contrastin g the two policies-that in respect to public schools and that
in respect to the care of the Indians-it would seem that we
are called upon to uphold the rights of the Indians, which otherwise would be wholly lost without compensation as against the
claims of the State for which satisfaction in other directions has
been provided.
For these reasons we are of opinion that the claim of Minnesota to these lands cannot be sustained, and a decree will be
entered in favor of the defendants dismissing the bill.
MR. JUsTIoE GRAY did not hear the argument, and took no

part in the decision of this case.
