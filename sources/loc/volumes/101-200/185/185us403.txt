CARNEGIE STEEL COMPANY v. CAMBRIA IRON
COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 17. Argued October 17, 18, 21, 1901.-Decided Bray 5, 1902.
Patent No. 404,414, issued June 4, 1889, to William R. Jones, for a "method
of mixing molten pig metal," is a good and valid patent, and was infringed by the defendant.
The process described in the patent consisted of a large reservoir between
the blast furnaces and the converters, in which should always be maintained a large quantity of metal, which should be drawn off in small
quantities at a time and replenished by a like quantity of metal from the
blast furnaces.
A process patent can only be anticipated by a similar process. A process
patent is not anticipated by mechanism which might, with slight alterations, have been adapted to carry out that process, unless at least such
use of it would have occurred to one whose duty it was to make practical
use of the mechanism described.
A disclaimer may extend to a part of the specification as well as to a claim
or one feature of a claim, though it would be otherwise if the purpose of
the disclaimer had been to alter the description of the invention, or convert the claim from one thing into something else.
A stipulation of counsel entered into for the purpose of saving time may
be repudiated where the facts subsequently developed show that with respect to a particular matter it was inadvertently signed, provided that
notice be given in sufficient time to prevent prejudice to the opposite
party.

THIS was a bill in equity filed in the Circuit Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania by the Carnegie Steel Company against the Cambria Iron Company, for an injunction and
the recovery of damages for the infringement of letters patent
No. 404,414, issued June 4, 1889, to William R. Jones, of whom
plaintiff was the assignee, for a "method of mixing molten pig

position. In practice it is found that metal tapped from different blast furnaces is apt to vary considerably in chemical
composition, particularly in silicon and sulphur, and such lack
of uniformity is observable in different portions of the same
cast, and even in different portions of the same pig.
The consequence of this tendency of the silicon and sulphur to
segregate or form pockets in the crude metal is that the product of the refining process in the converters or otherwise in
like manner lacks uniformity in these elements, and therefore
often causes great inconvenience and loss, making it impossible
to manufacture all the articles of a single order of homogeneous
composition. Especially is this so in the process of refining
crude iron taken from the smelting furnace and charged directly
into the converter without remelting in a cupola, and, although
such direct process possesses many economic advantages, it has
on this account been little practiced."
"For the purpose of avoiding the practical evils above stated,
I use in the refining process a,charge composed not merely of
metal taken at one time from the smelting-furnace, but of a
number of parts taken from different smelting-furnaces, or from
the same furnace at different casts, or at different periods of
the same cast, and subject the metal before its final refining to
a process of mixing, whereby its particles are diffused or mingled
thoroughly among each other, and the entire charge is practically homogeneous in composition, representing in each part
the average of the unequally diffused and segregated elements
of silicon and sulphur originally contained in each of the several
parts or charges. By proceeding in this way not only is each
charge for the refining furnace or converter homogeneous in
itself, but, as it represents an average of a variety of uniform
constituent parts, all the charges of the converter from time to
time will be substantially uniform, and the products of all will
be homogeneous."
"To this end my invention may be practiced with a variety
of forms of apparatus-for example, by merely receiving in a
charging-ladlea nuzumber- of small pow'tions of metal taken.from
several ladles or eceiving-vessels containingcrude metal obtained

and other like means may be employed. (The clause in italics
was subsequently disclaimed.) I prefer, however, to employ
the apparatus shown in the accompanying drawings, and have
made it the subject of a separate patent application, serial
No. 289,673, and, without intending to limit the invention to
the use of that specific apparatus, I shall describe it particularly, so that others skilled in the art may intelligently employ
the same.
"fy invention is not limited to its use in connection with converters, since similar advantages may be obtained by casting the
metal from the mixing-vessel into _pigs for use in converters,
puddling-furnaces, or for any other uses to which pig-ironmay
be put in the art." (This paragraph subsequently disclaimed.)
(The apparatus is represented by the drawing here inserted.)

"Referring now to the drawings, 2 represents the reservoir
before mentioned. It consists of a covered hollow vessel having an outer casing 3, of iron or steel, which is suitably braced
and strengthened by interior beams and tie-rods, as shown in
the drawings. The whole exterior of the vessel is lined with
fire-brick or other refractory lining, which should be of suffi-

cient thickness to retain the heat of the molten contents of'
the vessel and to prevent chilling thereof. The vessel is
strongly braced and supported by braces and tie-rods, and
may be of any convenient size, holding, say, one hundred tons
of metal, (more or less,) and its shape is preferably such as
shown in the drawings, being rectangular, or nearly so, in
cross-section and an irregular trapezium in longitudinal section, one end being considerably deeper than the other. At
the top of the deeper end, which I call the 'rear' end, is a
hopper 5, into which the molten metal employed in charging
the vessel is poured, and at the front end is a discharge-spout 6,
which is so located that the bottom of the spout is some distance above the bottom of the vessel-say two feet in a hundred-ton tank, and more or less, according to the capacity of
the vessel-the purpose of which is that when the metal is
poured out of the spout a considerable quantity may always
be left remaining and unpoured, and that whenever the vessel is replenished there may already be contained in it a body
of molten metal with which the fresh addition may mix. I
thus secure, as much as possible, uniformityin character of the
metal which is fed to and discharged from the tank, and cause
the fluctuations in quality of the successive tappings to be very
gradual.
"For convenient use of the apparatus I have found it best
to so arrange it that it is adapted to receive its charges of metals from cars or bogies 7, which run on an elevated track at
about the level of the normal position of the hopper 5, and to
discharge its contents into similar cars or bogies 15 on a track
below the spout 6. In order to facilitate the charging and discharging of the metal, the vessel is set on journals or bearings 8,
which have their bearings in suitable pedestals 9, and its rear
end is provided with depending rack-bars 10, which are pivotally connected with the bottom of the mixing-vessel 2 and are
in gear with pinions 11, the shaft of which is connected by
gearings 12 with the driving mechanism of a suitable engine.
The pinions are held in gear with the rack-bars by idler wheels
or rollers 13. As the journals or bearings 8 are located on a
transverse line somewhat in advance of the center of gravity

Statement of the Case.

of the vessel, it tends by its own weight to tilt backward into
the position shown in Fig. 1, but may be restored to a level
position by driving the pinions 11, and thus raising .the rackbars 10 until the front part of the bottom of the vessel comes
in contact with a rest or stop 14.
"The mode of operation of the apparatus is as follows:
When the vessel is in the backwardly-inclined position shown
in Fig. 1, it is ready to receive a charge of metal from the
car 7. Before introducing the first charge, however, the
mixing-vessels should be heated by internal combustion of
coke or gas, and when the walls of the vessel are sufficiently
hot to hold the molten metal without chilling it it is charged
repeatedly from the cars ' with metal obtained either from a
number of furnaces or at different times from a single furnace.
The charges of metal introduced at different times into the vessel, though differing in quality, mix together, and when the vessel has received a sufficient charge its contents constitute a
homogeneous molten mass, whose quality may not be precisely
the same as that of any one of its constituent charges, but represents the avetage quality of all the charges. If desired, the
commingling of the contents may be aided by agitation of the
vessel on its trunnions, so as to cause the stirring or shaking of
its liquid contents. The mixing-chamber being deeper at its
rear than at the front end, as before described, and its normal
position when not discharging metal for the purpose of casting
being with the bottom inclined upward towdrd the front or discharging end, and the bottom of the spout being situate above
the bottom of the vessel at its forward end, it is adapted to receive and hold a large quantity of molten meial without its
surface rising high enough to enter the discharge-spout.
"The discharge-spout 6 is furnished with a movable cover
operated by a weighted.lever 16, which, when closed, serves to
exclude the outside air and prevent a draft of air through the
vessel and the consequent rapid cooling of the molten contents.
If care is exercised in keeping the cover closed, the metal can
be kept in a fluid condition for a long time, the heat being kept
up by repeated fresh charges of molten metal, and, if necessary
or found desirable, by burning gas introduced by a pipe or pipes
into its interior.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.

"After the vessel is properly charged, the metal is drawn off
into the cars 15 from time to time, as it is needed, by opening the
door or cover 16 of the spout 6 and driving the engine 12, so as
to elevate the rear end of the vessel and tilt it forward, and
thus to discharge any required amount of its contents in the
manner before explained into the cars 15, which are transported
to the converters, or the metal is cast into _igs or otherwiseused.

(Italics disclaimed.) The tilting of the vessel does not, however, drain off all the contents thereof, a portion being prevented from escaping by reason of the elevated position of the
spout 6, and as the vessel is replenished from time to time each
new charge mixes with parts of previous charges remaining
in the vessel, by which means any sudden variations in the
quality of the metal supplied to the converter is avoided. Instead of discharging the metal into the cars 12 and carrying it
in the cars to the converters or casting-house, the vessel 2 may
be so situate relatively to the other parts of a furnace-plant as
to deliver its contents immediately to the converters or other
place where it is to be utilized.
"I find it in practice very advantageous to employ two or
more mixing vessels constructed substantially as I have described, and to draw a portion of each converter charge from
each of the mixing vessels. My invention is, however, not limited to the employment of two or any specific number of such
vessels.
"I shall now describe, briefly, other parts of the apparatus
which are desirable and important in its practical use.
"At the top of the vessel 2 are man-holes 17, designed to
permit of access to its interior for the purpose of repairing or
fixing the lining. These holes are provided with suitable covers 18 to exclude cold drafts of air from entering, the interior.
There is also a hole 19 at the rear end of the vessel near the
top, through which a rabble may be inserted for the purpose
of assisting or accelerating the mixing of the molten metal,
and at the other end, at the level of the bottom of the interior,
there are holes 20, provided with suitable spouts to enable all
the molten contents to be drawn off when it becomes necessary
to do so. (See Fig. 3.) The holes 20 should be provided with
suitable stoppers.

Counsel for Parties.

"I claim"1. In the art of refining iron directly from the smelting furnace, the process of equalizing the chemical composition of the
crude metal by thoroughly commingling or mixing together
the liquid-metal charge and subsequently refining the mixed
and equalized charge, substantially as and for the purposes described.
"2. In the art of mixing molten metal to secure uniformity of
the same in its constituent parts preparatory to further treatment, the process of introducing into a mixing receptacle successive portions of molten metal ununiform in their non-metallic
constituents, (sulphur, silicon, etc.,) removing portions only of
the composite molten contents of the receptacle without entirely draining or emptying the same, and successively replenishing the receptacle with fresh ununiform additions, substantially as and for the purposes described."

The answer set up the invalidity of the patent by reason of
an insufficient specification, anticipation, want of novelty and
abandonment; and also denied infringement.'
Upon a hearing upon the pleadings and proofs, the Circuit
Court held with the plaintiff, and found that the process was
patentable; that it was not anticipated; that it was of great
utility and importance, and that defendant had infringed the

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

IMR. JUSTICE Bnowx delivered the opinion of the court.
Steel is a product, or, perhaps, more accurately, a species of
iron, refined of some of its grosser elements, intermediate in the
amount of its carbon between wrought and cast iron, and tempered to a hardness which enables it to take a cutting edge, a
toughness sufficient to bear a heavy strain, an elasticity which
adapts it for springs and other articles requiring resiliency, as
well as a susceptibility to polish, which makes it useful for ornamental and artistic purposes.
Pig iron, which was the original basis for the manufacture of
all iron and steel, is made by the reduction of iron ore in large
blast furnaces, which are filled with layers of ore, charcoal or
coke and flux. By the agency of this the iron is melted out and
falls to the bottom of the furnaces, is drawn out through openings for that purpose into canals, and finally into moulds, where
it solidifies into what are termed pigs. Prior to the invention
of Sir Henry Bessemer, steel was manufactured from a pig iron
base by a tedious and expensive process of refining in furnaces
adapted to that purpose. The process was so costly that steel
was little used except for cutlery and comparatively small articles, and was practically unknown in the construction of bridges,
rails, buildings and other structures, where large quantities of
iron were required.
In 1856, Bessemer discovered a process of purifying iron without the use of fuel, by blowing air through a molten mass of
pig iron placed in a refractory lined vessel called a converter,
whereby the silicon, carbon and other non-metallic constituents
were consumed, and the iron thus fitted for immediate conversion into steel by recarbonization. The present process of recarbonization was a supplementary invention of Mushet, who
accomplished it by the introduction of ferromanganese, or spiegel-eisen, while the iron in a molten state was issuing from the
converter, in which it had been purified, and was thus converted
into steel. The process of running molten metal from blast
furnaces into pigs and remelting them in cupola furnaces for
use in a converter was termed the indirect process, and was
generally used prior to the Jones invention.

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

411

Opinion of the Court.

His process is thus described by Bessemer in his patent of
1869: "The most important of these operations consist in melting the pig metal, transferring it in the molten state to the converting vessel, blowing air through it, and converting it into a
malleable metal, mixing the metal so converted with a certain
quantity of fluid manganesian pig iron, pouring the mixed metals
into a casting ladle, and running it from thence through a
suitable valve into ingots or other moulds, and the removal therefrom of the ingots or other cast masses when solidified." This
invention of Bessemer, simple as it appears, may be said not
only to have revolutionized the manufacture of steel, and to have
introduced it into large constructions where it had never been
seen before, but to have created for it uses to which ordinary
iron had been but illy adapted.
While in the Bessemer specification of 1856 it is said "the
iron to be used for the purposes of my present invention may be
conveyed by a gutter in a fluid state direct from the smelting
furnace where it has been obtained from the ore," without the
expense and delay incident to the intermediate cupola process,
practical experience, in this country at least, showed that the
refining of iron without first casting it into pigs, selecting or
mixing the pigs and remelting them, was attended with such
expense that the entire abandonment of the practice was seriously considered. The difficulty was in the material variations
between different portions of the same cast, and even different
parts of the same pig,-an irregularity which was increased
when the metal was drawn from several furnaces. There was
added to this frequent changes in the character and composition
of the ore, coke and limestone flux with which the furnace was
charged. The consequence was that the non-uniform chemical
composition of the metal from the molten blast furnaces yielded
products of steel, such as rails and beams, which were not only
irregular chemically, but of irregular and uncertain final condition-some sound, others of imperfect strength and full of
flaws.
These irregularities were in a measure obviated, not only by
a careful selection of pigs beforehand, but by the necessity of
employing open receiving ladles or reservoirs into which the

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

product of one or more cupola furnaces was drawn off into
such reservoirs, which were made large enough to hold the product of two or three furnaces, and from which the molten metal
was withdrawn into the converters. iad the amount required
for the converters in each case been the exact product of one or
more cupolas, no reservoirs would have been necessary, but as
the demand was variable, a storage of molten metal was required to retain the product of one or more cupolas, until it was
required for the converters. Of course, as the product of two
or more furnaces was drawn off into these receiving ladles,
there would be some intermixing of those products, although
the receiving ladles do not appear to have been used for that
purpose, the operators relying more particularly upon the careful selection of pigs beforehand, to obtain the requisite uniformity for conversion into steel. The ladles being open at the top,
the molten metal could not long be retained in them, and in the
best practice it was so arranged that the withdrawals from the
reservoir were made every few minutes, and without regard to
the amount left in the reservoir after each withdrawal. It will
be borne in mind that the object in either case, whether by direct or indirect process, is to obtain, as far as possible, a uniform product of iron for the converter.
"These results," said one of the witnesses (Kennedy), speaking of the process used before that of Jones, "are not obtained
by the practice of taking metal from two blast furnaces by running a train of ladles in front of them and tapping into each
ladle half a charge and following it from a second furnace. By
such practice, of course, there is some independent equalization
of the composition of each ladle or of the ladles of each group,
but it affords no further advantage, and in fact would not obviate
the difficulties of direct metal working. It does not enable
the converter manager to foretell the character of each charge
from the character of the preceding charge, and would therefore entail the uncertainties of operation and the irregularity
of the product which the Jones method avoids."
It had long been an object of manufacturers that steel should
be made directly from the molten metal, as it comes from the
blast furnaces, without having to pass through the intermediate

Opinion of the Court.

or cupola process, which involved the casting of the furnace
metal into pigs. These, after becoming cold, were assorted,
broken up, recharged and remelted in a cupola furnace, and
then placed in a converter for conversion into steel. By this
c pola process a product, practically uniform in character and
suitable for further treatment in the converters, was secured,
but at the expense (more than 60 cents per ton) of rehandling
and remelting the iron as it came from the blast furnaces,
in cupolas, and the contamination of the metal with sulphur
evolved from the coke in the process of remelting. The obstacles connected with this method and the difficulties attendant
upon the use of the direct process are thus comprehensively set
forth by Mr. Julian Kennedy, one of the experts:
"Ever since the invention of the Bessemer process it has been
well recognized that great economies could be attained by transferring the molten metal from the blast furnace to the converter
without allowing it to solidify. Until within a few years, however, this direct process, as it has been called, has not been generally used. It is easy to see why this was the case. The
fluctuation in the chemical composition of the metal from the
blast furnace was too great to allow that degree of uniformity
of product in the Bessemer steel produced from it, which is
absolutely necessary in the case of steel rails, for example, which
must be as reliable as human skill can make them, and where
no reasonable expense can be spared to make them perfectly
safe and trustworthy. A very few broken rails in a track, with
the damage to property and human life which this might cause,
would far more than offset any possible saving in a year's work,
due to the use of the direct process. For this reason the practice, until within comparatively recent years, has been to cast
the metal in pigs, then to analyze it and reject any portion not
closely approximating a rigid specification in its chemical composition, and to select, mix and then melt the approved metal
in cupola furnaces. By this means very great uniformity of
chemical composition of the remelted metal can be obtained, and
good and reliable steel made from it with regularity and certainty."

OCTOBER' 'T'ERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

Speaking of a time when the direct process (before that of
Jones had been in use for several years) he said:
"After studying the results which had been obtained at the
Edgar Thompson works and elsewhere in the use of the direct
process, I consulted with Mr. James Gayley, and we agreed
that in the building of a new works it would not be profitable
to use direct metal, but that on the contrary the disadvantages
resulting from the irregularity in the product were so great
that it would be better to go to the expense of building and
using cupola furnaces. We did not then perceive any means
adequate to overcome these disadvantages."
The difficulties connected with the prior devices are also stated
in an article by Mr. Iolley, published in 1877, from which we
extract the following paragraph :
"Third. The embarrassing feature of the direct process is
the irregularity in the heat-that is to say, in the silicon of the
charges-resulting in the large amount of scrap due to too little
or this element, and in the increased number of second-quality
rails due to too much of it; while in France, where 3 to 5 per
cent of manganese is the heating ingredient, there may always
be an excess of this latter element without injuring the quality
of the steel, although the variation of heat is here, also, a serious
difficulty. In other words, it has not yet been practicable to
work the blast furnace with sufficient regularity to realize approximately the theoretical advantages of the direct process."
"Fourth. The obvious remedy is to mix a number of blastfurnace charges, so as to reduce the irregularity to a minimum.
Two systems of doing this are on the eve of trial: the one is
simply mixing so few charges in a tank that the metal will be
drawn out before it chills; the other is to store a larger number
of charges in a heated tank-that is to say, in an immense openhearth furnace."
"A few words of history may be of interest. Mr. Bessemer's early intention was to use blast-furnace metal direct.
The earlier Bessemer practice, especially that in Sweden, was
with metal right from the blast furnace. But this practice did
not make headway, except where there was from 3 to 5 per
cent of manganese in the pig blown, for reasons just men-

tioned; so that while it soon became standard at Terrenoire
and elsewhere in France, as well as in Sweden, and to some
extent in Germany, yet in England it was not only unused but
pronounced impracticable so late as September, 1874."
This difficulty, and it seems to have been so serious as to render the direct process commercially impracticable, Jones sought
to remedy and did remedy by creating a covered reservoir of
molten metal between the blast furnaces and the converters,
in which should always be maintained a large quantity of metal,
happily termed by the District Judge a dominant pool, which
should be drawn off in small quantities at a time, and replenished by a like quantity of metal from the blast furnaces. In

this way, while the metals taken from the several blast furnaces
might differ in their heat and constitutent elements, yet being
received and mixed with the molten metal in the dominant pool,

they were, when discharged from the reservoir, approximately,
though not perfectly, uniform, the original variations having
been lost in their mixture with the dominant pool.

"It is there-

fore plain," says the District Judge in his opinion, "that with
a mixer thus operated, it is possible to have wide variations in
the composition of the blast furnace metal charges added, and
at the same time the successive withdrawals from the Bessemer*converter show quite small and gradual changes of composition. The heat of the detained mass is affected by the incoming charges just from the blast furnace, but the heat of such
addition, whether relatively high or low, must mingle with, be
modified by, and average with, the heat of the larger and dominating mass." It is not insisted that this method gave absolutely uniform results, "nor," says the witness Fry, "did the
inventor, as I understood him, comprehend such, but, on the contrary, he recognized the practical impossibility of rendering
uniform a continuous supply of metal, and desired only to reduce the abrupt changes of the several portions added to the
gradual changes of the portions withdrawn, and this is what be
worked out from his invention in a thoroughly practical way."
While the patent in suit is for a process and not for a mechanism, the process will be the more easily understood by a reference to the apparatus above reproduced, which consists of a

reservoir, or closed receptacle, commonly termed a "mixer"
lined with fire brick of sufficient thickness to retain the heat of
the molten iron, and of such size and strength as to be capable
of receiving and retaining a large amount-" say one hundred
tons "-of molten iron. This reservoir is mounted upon journals,
and is adapted to be tipped so as to receive at one end molten
metal from the blast furnaces, Carried to it in cars, and by being
tipped in the other direction, to discharge the same into similar
cars, in which it is carried to the converter. The essence of the
invention lies in the fact that the tip is so regulated by a stop
that the reservoir can never be wholly emptied, but a "considerable quantity" of metal always remains,-a dominant pool,
into which successive additions are received.
That the invention is one of very considerable importance is
attested by the fact that it was not only put into immediate use
in the Edgar Thompson works at Braddock, then owned by the
plaintiff, but has since been adopted by all the leading steel
manufacturers in this country, and by many similar works in
Europe, where the patent was sold for ten thousand pounds.
Mr. Carnegie, one of the witnesses, says of it: "There were
both advantages and disadvantages" (in the direct process used
prior to Jones' invention,) " but the disadvantages were so great,
that we often debated whether to abandon the process or not.
We found it impossible to get a uniform quality of rails, as well
as by the cupola method.

the mode of running direct from the blast furnace. Above all
things, the manufacturer has to regard the uniformity of prod-

uct, the equality of rails, and this uniformity cannot be obtained
without Jones' invention, as far as I know."
It is true that what is termed the direct process was used in
connection with the Bessemer invention in some foreign countries, notably Sweden and France, with more or less success;
due to the peculiar character of the ores used in those countries ;
but such attempts in this country had proven practically failures, and had been abandoned. In regard to this the witness
Kennedy said:
"The Jones method has made the direct process, which was
attended with great danger and difficulties before the date of
his invention, a thoroughly practicable and successful one. Instead of it being a question of great doubt whether to run the
metal direct to the converter or remelt it, as it was up to the
time of Jones' invention, no one would now think of building
a new works, containing both furnaces and converters, without
arranging to mix the metal by the Jones method, which not
only effects an immense saving in the cost of operating the
works, but enables a uniformly good product to be made, and
also a purer product that can be obtained from cupola metal,
which absorbs and is contaminated by sulphur from the coke
which constitutes the fuel of the cupola."
Indeed, the value of the process is not wholly denied, though
much depreciated, by the defendant, which relies rather upon
the fact that it was well known in the art, and that so far as it
is described in the Jones' specification and drawings it was not
infringed by it.
1. We now proceed to an examination of the question of
anticipation,in support of which a number of English patents
are produced, which will be briefly considered: First, the British patent to Tabberner of 1856, the object of which was, as
stated by the patentee in his specification, "to dispense with
the necessity of employing one or more large furnaces, and to
use in lieu thereof several small furnaces, the combined capacities whereof are equal to that of one or more large furnaces,
and to cause these small furnaces to discharge their contents at
short intervals of time into one large reservoir, from which the

Opinion of the Court.

principal features in this invention consist in directing the blast
to the body or belly of the furnace, as well as to the hearth
thereof, for the purpose of fusing or smelting the entire mass
of ore in the furnace simultaneously, or nearly so. . . . The
mode hitherto practiced in smelting furnaces has been to direct
blasts into the hearth only thereof, thereby requiring several
hours to smelt or fuse the contents of a large furnace." The
specification is somewhat blind, and it is difficult to see what
definite or valuable result is obtained by the use of several
small instead of one large furnace, except perhaps a quicker
heating and less delay in its practical operations; but it is sufficient for the purposes of this case to say of it that it contains
no suggestion of a mixing of different casts for the purpose of
obtaining a more uniform product, and that the invention has
no relation to a further treatment or refining. It does contemplate the use of a reservoir, but there is no suggestion of a
reservation in such reservoir or a quantity of molten metal. It
is not denied that the use of a reservoir from which molten
metal may be drawn long antedated the Jones patent. But
the best that can be said of the Tabberner patent is that, if the
reservoir had been of sufficient size and properly constructed so
as to never be completely emptied, it might have been adapted
to carry out the Jones process; but there is no evidence that
it was ever so constructed, or that the production of a uniform
discharge from the reservoir was contemplated. That it could
not have been intended for the purpose of carrying out the
Bessemer process, or any other process, for the use of blast furnace metal in a converter, is evident from the fact that the
patent was nearly simultaneous with the Bessemer patent, of
the existence of which the patentee appears to have been entirely ignorant.
The English patent to Deighton of 18'13, for "improvements
in the arrangement and mode of worldng an apparatus for the
manufacture of Bessemer steel," contains the closest approximation to the principle of the Jones invention. If this does
not anticipate, none does. The primary object of the patent
seems to have been to prevent the loss of time while the converters are being cooled and relined or repaired, and again

prepared for work, by providing that the converting vessel
shall be so arranged that it can be readily detached from its
actuating mechanism and lifted bodily out of its bearings by a
suitable crane, or other lifting mechanism, and a spare converter substituted in its place.
There is, however, a further provision in the patent, as follows:
"Instead of manufacturing Bessemer iron or steel from pig
iron, which has to be melted in cupolas, my invention also consists in taking the molten metal directly from the blast furnace
to the converter, in which case I prefer to arrange the Bessemer
plant in a line at a right angle to a row of two or more blast
furnaces, and place a vessel to receive the molten metal tapped
from two or more blast furnaces to get a better average of
metal which will be more suitable for making Bessemer steel
or metal of uniform quality, the vessel or receiver being placed
on a weighing machine so that any required weight may be
drawn or tapped from it and charged into the converter."
The specifications provide for manufacturing Bessemer steel
directly from the smelting furnace by employing gates or channels for molten metal from each furnace, leading to a reservoir,
which is placed low enough to give fall for the molten metal to
flow from the blast furnace to this reservoir, which forms a receptacle for mixing the molten metal from two or more of the
smelting furnaces. From the reservoir, the mixed molten metal
is tapped and flows down the swivel trough into the converter.
By placing the reservoir on a weighing machine, it can be-eadily ascertained when the exact quantity required has been tapped
from it into the converter. The sixth claim of the patent is for
"the system or mode of arranging and working Bessemer converters with a receiver or receptacle for mixing the molten
metal from two or more smelting furnaces to get a more uniform quality of metal, substantially as hereinbefore described
and illustrated by the drawings."
While Deighton seems to have conceived the idea that uniformity of product was necessary to the successful use of the
direct process, and might be attained by mixing the discharge
from several blast furnaces in an open reservoir, standing be-

tween the furnaces and the converter, the dominant idea of the
Jones invention, that a constant quantity of molten iron should
always be kept in such reservoir to serve as a basis for such
mixture and an equalizer of the different discharges, does not
seem to have occurred to him. As the discharge pipe was located at the bottom of the reservoir, it was certainly possible
to empty it entirely, and the testimony in the case indicates that
this was the natural method of operation. If this were so, then
the reservoir accomplished nothing beyond the mixing of each
batch of metal introduced into it from the different blast furnaces. There is nowhere in the specification a suggestion of
supplying to and withdrawing from the reservoir small amounts
at a time, a constant quantity of metal being retained in the
reservoir for the purpose of equalizing the different products of
the blast furnaces. While the Deighton reservoir, if a cover
had been added to it, might perhaps have been utilized for that
purpose, there is no evidence that such use ever occurred to the
inventor. Indeed, the absence of a cover to the reservoir is
evidence, even to a non-expert, that it was not contemplated
that a permanent quantity of molten iron should be retained in
it, since a radiation of heat would thereby be produced and the
contents skulled or crusted over with a layer of refuse iron or
slag. The testimony is clear that the Jones process cannot be
carried on in an open reservoir, and the absence of a cover in
conclusive that it is not so used.
It is insisted, however, that defendants have demonstrated,
by practical experimentation with a plant constructed according to the specification of the Deighton patent, that the results
are practically the same as those obtained by the Jones process.
This plant, however, was constructed after suit brought, long
after the Deigbton patent had been allowed to expire, and with
no opportunity afforded the plaintiffs to inspect the plant or
witness its operation. The tank was fitted with a cover, and a
constant pool of molten metal retained in it; but this was not
the Deighton process, but the Jones process adapted to the
Deighton device. Were this evidence admissible at all, we are
satisfied that it is met by the fact that if the Deighton patent
had been adaptable to the Jones process, it is scarcely possible

Opinion of the Court.

that its merits should have failed to seize upon the attention of
manufacturers, who would have brought the patent into general
use, instead of allowing it to lapse for the non-payment of a
comparatively small fee. As something in the nature of the
Jones process was needed to enable steel to be manufactured
directly from the product of blast furnaces, the utility of the
Deighton patent for that purpose would at once have been recognized and its success assured. But evidently that patent was
not the final step in the accomplishment of the mixing process.
It contributed nothing to the art of manufacturing steel, and,
although issued in 1873, was allowed to lapse in 1876, after an
apparently unprofitable existence for three years, by reason of
the non-payment of the stamp duty necessary to keep it alive.
It is sufficient to say of it that it fails to disclose, fully and precisely, the essential features of the process covered by the Jones
patent. Walker on Pats. sec. 54; Seymour v. Osbor e, 11
Wall. 516, 555; Te Cajwood Patent, 97 U. S. 704.
Although Deighton was an employs of the Moss Bay Company of Workington, England, if any attempt were made by
this company to make use of his process, it evidently amounted
to nothing, since one of the writers, Snelus, contributing to the
Journal of the Iron & Steel Institute, 1876, says: "One great
drawback to the direct casting process was that you could not
always get your metal at the exact time you wanted it. He
believed that it would be found that the great advantage the
Bessemer works in America had was the intermediate receiving
ladle, which was designed by Mr. Holley, and which was universally used there, although it was never used in England.
The Moss Bay Company attempted to modify the thing some
time ago, and put up a heating furnace; but that, to his mind,
was a step in the wrong direction. Anyhow, the thing had
failed, and no one in England, so far as he knew, was using any
intermediate receiver between the blast furnace and the converters."
This defence presents the common instance of a patent which
attracted no attention, and was 'commercially a failure, being
set up as an anticipation of a subsequent patent, which has
proved a success, because there appears to be in the mechanism

Opinion of the Court.

described a possibility of its having been, with some alterations,
adaptable to the process thereafter discovered. As hereinafter
observed, a process patent can only be anticipated by a similar
process. It is not sufficient to show a piece of mechanism by
which the process rnigkt have been performed.
In the American patents to Durfee, Nos. 118,597 and 122,312,
both of 1871, the desirableness of manufacturing steel directly
from the blast furnace is recognized, and in his second patent
he says: "That in the manufacture of steel by the pneumatic
or Bessemer process, a great saving of fuel and iron, of wear
and tear of furnaces, and of labor would be effected were it
possible to make uniformly good products of the desired temper by converting the crude iron imnmeditely it is tapped from
the blast furnace in which it is made. This plan has been and
may still be practiced to a considerable extent, but it has been
found that by reason of the irreoular working of blast furnaces,
and the consequent varying character and quality of the crude
iron produced, it was alays very difficult and in most cases
impossible to secure such uniformity in the converted metal as
was essential to success in the business. Hence, at several establishments where the plan of taking the fluid iron as it was
tapped from the blast furnaces and pouring it at once into the
converter has been practiced, it has been abandoned, the proprietors preferring to incur the expense of handling and remelting the crude iron after it had been cast into pigs in order thus
to secure the advantage of carefully selecting and mixing the
materials for each charge to be converted."
He proposed to -accomplish this by using a reverberatory gas
furnace, into which the crude iron from the blast furnace is
poured, and in which it may be mixed with other irons, and so
treated as to insure uniformity. Pig iron of different qualities,
or any metals or metalloids or fluxes can be added and mixed
with the metal as may be necessary to bring it to the required
character. The process is so manifestly different from that
described by Jones that it demands no further attention. If
it were put in practice at all, it seems to have proved a failure,
as, although an English patent was taken out by Durfee, it was
allowed to lapse by reason of the non-payment of the stamp
duty.

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

423

Opinion of the Court.

Two American patents to James P. Witherow, No. 315,587
and No. 327,425, both issued in 1885, are pressed upon our attention. In the second patent, the only one necessary to notice,
he restates the advantages of the direct process and the difficulties theretofore encountered in its practical operation. "In the
manufacture of steel by the pneumatic process, the converters
are charged with molten metal, the product of the blast furnace.
This metal is usually cast in the form of pigs, then remelted in
the cupola as needed before being charged into the converter.
It is very desirable to take advantage of the molten
condition of the metal as it comes from the blast furnace for
its use in the converter, because thereby the remelting of the
metal and the expense of the construction of a cupola may be
avoided. The charge of the converter is from one to five tons,
and the casting of a blast furnace runs usually from ten to fifty
tons. The difficulty of using the molten metal from the furnace to the converter consists in keeping the large quantity of
metal from the latter in a proper molten condition for use in
the former." He proposed to remedy this by a reservoir provided with a suitable cover and with tuyeres " which blow down
upon the surface of the metal for the purpose of maintaining
its heat and fluidity." As this reservoir was apparently adapted
to hold only a single cast, and therefore must be emptied before
another cast was received into it, it was impossible that Witherow intended by its use to practice the Jones process. There
is no suggestion anywhere in the patent of a desire to retain a
quantity of metal in the reservoir to serve as a basis for mixing
the various products of the blast furnace, which was the dominant idea of the Jones patent. To anticipate a process patent,
it is necessary not only to show that the prior patent might
have been used to carry out the process, but that such use was
contemplated, or that the leading idea of the Jones patent of
maintaining a dominant pool in the reservoir was such a use of
the Witherow patents as would have occurred to an ordinary
mechanic in operating his device. Whether the reservoir in
the Witherow patent was partly or fully emptied, seems to have
been a matter of complete indifference to the inventor, and the
idea of maintaining a constant quantity therein seems to have

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

never been conceived by him. His design seems to have been
merely to provide a reservoir for the storage of the large quantity of metal from the blast furnaces, and to maintain its heat
until the comparatively small quantities required in the converters had been drawn off for use. As he states in his specification: "The metal is usually tapped from a blast furnace once
in every six hours, and the quantity thus cast is many times in
excess of the charge of a converter," which "is from one to
five tons," while "the cast of a blast furnace runs usually from
ten to fifty tons." While the metal is tapped from the blast
furnace once in every six hours, "the time between charges in
the converter is usually twenty minutes and upwards, and the
metal in the furnace must be kept in condition to be tapped
from time to time into the converter as needed." This appears
to have been the whole object of the invention.
The same remark may be made of all these prior devices.
While all contemplate the reservoir between the blast furnaces
and the converters, such reservoir is used for storage and for
such incidental steps toward uniformity as the necessary mixing of the different products of the blast furnace would lead to,
while in none of them is there a provision for supplying and
withdrawing from the mixer such quantities of metal at a time
and the retention of a considerable quantity of metal in the
reservoir as a necessary prerequisite to that uniformity of product which was recognized as the great desideratum and was
the constant effort of manufacturers to secure. Granting that
some of these devices may have been made use of to carry out
the Jones process, none of them in practical operation seems to
have been effective to secure the desired result. A process patent, such as that of Jones, is not anticipated by mechanism
which might with slight alterations have been adapted to carry
out that process, unless, at least, such use of it would have occurred to one whose duty it was to take practical use of the
mechanism described. In other words, a process patent can
only be anticipated by a similar process. A mechanical patent
is anticipated by a prior device of like construction and capable
of performing the same function; but it is otherwise with a
process patent. The mere possession of an instrument or piece

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

425

Opinion of the Court.

of mechanism contains no suggestion whatever of all the possible processes to which it may be adapted. Fermentation Co.
v. .Maus,122 U. S. 413, 428. If the mere fact that a prior device might be made effective for the carrying on of a particular
process were sufficient to anticipate such process, the absurd
result would follow that, if the process consisted merely of
manipulation, it would be anticipated by the mere possession
of a pair of hands.
True, if the process were the mere function of a machine,
another machine capable of performing the same function might
be an anticipation; but this is not because a process can be
anticipated by a mechanism, but because, as we have held in
several cases, the mere function of a machine is not patentable
as a process at all. Corning v. Burden, 15 How. 252; Risdon Locomotive Wfrorks v. JMedart, 158 U. S. 68.
To enable the Jones process to be successfully carried out it
is necessary (1) that the intermediate reservoir or mixer should
be of large size, "say 100 tons" capacity; (2) that it be covered
to prevent the access of cold air from without; (3) that it be
provided with a stop, so that it may not be tilted so far as to
be emptied of its contents; (4) that a quantity of molten metal
so large as to absorb all the variations of the product of the
blast furnace received into it and thus to unify the metals discharged into the converters, be constantly retained in it. None
of the prior patents or processes to which we are referred
meets these requirements. Indeed, it is scarcely too much to
say that none meets more than one of them. When we add to
this that none of them was ever used, or was ever susceptible of
being used, without material alteration, to carry out the Jones
process, it is evident that the defence of anticipation by prior
patents rests upon a slender foundation.
Certain discussions, reported in the Journal of the British
Iron and Steel Institute, are relied upon as embodying a description of the Jones process. Running through all these
discussions, there is the same idea of the difficulties experienced in the practical carrying out of the direct process by
reason of the want of uniformity in the different products of
the blast furnaces, and the possibility of remedying this and

Opinion of the Court.

thereby doing away with the expense of remelting the pig
iron in cupolas by a mixture of such products in a reservoir
intermediate the furnaces and the converters; but the domi-

nant idea of the Jones patent, of maintaining a permanent
and large quantity of molten metal in the mixer for that purpose, does not seem to have occurred to any of the writers upon
the subject. Through all these papers, there is an admission of
practical failure in the efforts theretofore made to obviate the

difficulty, and a half-expressed hope that American ingenuity
might ultimately solve the problem. Some of the expressions,
taken by themselves, seem to foreshadow the Jones idea; but
there was nothing in any of these discussions that filled the requirement of the law, Rev. Stat. sec. 4886, of a description in a

publication sufficient to anticipate the patent.
In some of the very works where attempts had been made
to adopt a direct process, they were abandoned as unprofitable, and the Jones invention subsequently adopted. The witness, David Evans, manager of certain iron works in England
and Wales, sums up his testimony in the following answer:
"Prior to the invention of Captain Jones several firms used
the direct process, but the results were not very satisfactory,
as explained before, through want of uniformity. The results
obtained gave a large number of defectives. But since the
adoption of the mixer at the various works I have been engaged, we have reduced the defective or second class rails
fully one half, and also saved the remelting." Indeed, it is
stated by several of these writers that the adoption of the
Jones invention reduced the defective rails to something like
half of what they were before.
Our attention is also challenged to certain unpatented practices, amnong which is one known as the Whitney foundry practice for the casting of car wheels, wherein the metal is tapped
from three cupolas into an open reservior of eight to ten tons
capacity, permitted to mix and even up in it, and the charges
withdrawn to be cast into car wheels, the reservoir being maintained half full. The practice was to run the metal from the
cupola furnaces into the reservoir ladle until it was nearly full,
then to begin pouring out charges into the casting ladles, while

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

427

Opinion of the Court.

still continuing to pour metal into the ladle from the furnaces,
the ladle being kept approximately full during the working day,
when it was emptied and refilled on the following day. Aside
from the fact that this process has only to do with cupola metal,
uniformity in which was largely secured by a careful selection

of the pig iron charged into the cupola furnaces, and had no
reference whatever to the direct process of charging converters

with the product of blast furnaces, it appears that, while Whitney recognized the fact that the charges of iron from the cupolas when run together into the ladle would mix, it appears that
with this running together of the different charges, the mixing operation ended. The maintenance of a permanent pool,
and the constant pouring in and out ih ladlefuls-the essence
of the Jones invention-had nothing to do with the process.
Indeed, it may be doubted whether the mixing of the cupola
metal was of any substantial value. Evidently it suggested to
no one the Jones process. It is now too late to insist that it
would have been suggested to any mechanic of ordinary skill
and intelligence. But if the Whitney practice were primarily
for the purpose of mixing, and were adequate for that purpose
when applied to cupola metal carefully selected beforehand, it
might be, and evidently would have been, wholly inefficient
when sued for the purpose of unifying the products of blast
furnaces,-in other words, for the Jones process; and it might
and did require invention to make such changes as were necessary to adapt it to such purpose. Doubtless there was such mixing as the carefully selected cupola metal required for the purpose
of manufacturing car wheels, but the fact that the Whitney practice was used for cupola metal has but little tendency to prove
that it was adaptable without change to metal tapped from blast
furnaces, which varied so largely in chemical composition.
The following observations of the District Judge are illustrative of the distinction between the Whitney Foundry practice
and the Jones process:
"We must avoid being misled by mere terms and subjects of
work. Jones and Whitney both were concerned in the melting
of metals, yet they had widely different objects in view. Whitney's purpose was to cast molten metal into a finished product;

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

Jones' merely to prepare molten metal for further treatment,
to wit, decarburizing it into steel. The sine qua non of purpose in Whitney was product uniformity. Uniformity of quality in car wheels is required, so they will stand wear and uniform
wear."
"In the Bessemer direct process you cannot secure, initially
or by treatment, uniformity of molten metal; so far as yet
developed, the best you can do is to make the non-uniformity
gradual and not abrupt; in Whitney, non-uniformity, whether
gradual or abrupt, would be alike fatal. In Whitney, relatively
absolute uniformity is an essential of product and a sequence of
material used; in Jones, uniformity is a non-essential, in fact,
a non-attainable attribute of product, and is a necessary nonsequence of material used. In Whitney, we remelt in a cupola
metal which has already undergone the refining process of the
blast furnaces ; in Jones, we take metal direct from the furnace
and discard the cupola. It will thus be seen that apart from
the wide difference between the primary work of a huge blast
furnace, the base of all metallurgy, and the cupola of the founder,
a mere subdivision of that art, we find in the Jones and Whitney processes a substantial difference of purpose, of process and
of subject-matter of work."
It should be borne in mind throughout the whole of this discussion that Jones never claimed to have succeeded in making
a perfectly uniform product; that his object was to procure a
uniformity which was adequate for the complete carrying on of
the Bessemer process, or, as his second claim states, "for further treatment," and really to obviate the necessity of remelting the pigs, which had heretofore been regarded as preliminary
to the further treatment by the Bessemer process.
Substantially the same remarks may be made with regard to
the Kirk publication, which had to do only with the mixing of
cupola metal. This publication was first held by the Patent
Office to be an anticipation of the Jones process, the application
for which was rejected upon that ground. Upon further consideration, however, and with some slight amendments, the application of Jones appears to have been reconsidered, and was
finally granted.

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

429

Opinion of the Court.

An attempt was made to show that the Jones invention was
anticipated by the practice common in steel works prior thereto,
of tapping iron from cupola furnaces into a receiving ladle,
which became known as the Bessemer cupola ladle, from which
it was poured into the converters. Molten iron was tapped
from several cupolas into this ladle, from which a charge was
drawn and delivered to the converter vessel. Of course, if the
a
ladle were of greater capacity than was necessary to charge
but
it;
in
single converter, a residuum of metal would be left
this seems to have been merely an incident of the operation of
the ladle, which was used primarily for storage, and to have
been of no substantial benefit in securing uniformity of product,
which can only be obtained by making the receiver of larger
size and retaining a considerable quantity of metal in it after
each discharge. The witness Kennedy says of this process:

would be no regularity in the process. The rate at which the
converters take the metal does not always correspond with the
rate at which the cupolas are melting."
It is true the Jones patent is a simple one, and in the light of
present experience it seems strange that none of the expert steel
makers, who approach so near the consummation of their desires, should have failed to take the final step which was needed
to convert their experiments into an assured success. This, however, is but the common history of important inventions, the
simplicity of which seems to the ordinary observer to preclude
the possibility of their involving an exercise of the inventive
faculty. The very fact that the attempt which had been made
to secure a uniformity of product, seems to have been abandoned

after the Jones invention" came into popular notice, is strong
evidence tending to show that this patent contains something
which was of great value to the manufacturers of steel, and
which entitled Jones to the reward due to a successful inventor.
2. The phraseology of the patent and the amendments introduced in the Patent Office are made the subject of much
criticism, apparently for the purpose of showing either that
Jones did not understand what he had invented, or that the
specification did not contain "such full, clear, concise and exact
terms as to enable any person sll1ed in the art . .
to
make, construct, compound and use the same." Rev. Stat.
sec. 4888. If these criticisms are not altogether clear, they are
pressed upon our consideration with an earnestness which challenges a careful consideration of the history of this patent in
the Patent Office.
In his first application the patentee stated that "the primary
object of the invention is to provide means for insuring uniforinity in the product of a Bessemer steel works or a similar
plant, in which the metal from more than one blast furnace is
employed to charge the converters. The product of the different furnaces, or of the same furnace at different times, varies
in quality,

so that

the manufactured steel

lacks uniformity in grade. To avoid this I employ suitably
constructed reservoirs or vessels, into which the molten metal
friom the blast furnaces is put, the vessels being of proper capacity to hold a considerable charge of metal from a single furnace, or from a number of furnaces, and being adapted to retain
the metal in a molten state for sufficient time to enable the different charges to mix and become homogeneous. . . . Such

apparatus possesses also an additional advantage in that it
makes it .possible to dispense with cupola furnaces for remelting the pigs preparatory to charging the converters. The metal
may be tapped from the blast furnace into ladles or trucks, carried to and discharged into the mixing reservoir or vessel, and
there retained in a molten state until sufficient metal has been
accumulated to charge the converters."
It is true that he subsequently states, as observed in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, that "the main feature of my pres-

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

431

Opinion of the Court.

ent invention is the method of storing successive charges of
molten metal in a receptacle before using it in converters or
otherwise," and hence it is insisted that the main feature of the
invention was storage and not mixing; but the subsequent words
of the same sentence, "drawing portions of the metal from the
receptacle without at any time removing the whole thereof, and
from time to time replenishing the receptacle with fresh charges,
which mingle with the residual molten metal already therein, for
the purpose of rendering the successive tappings of metal uniform in quality," convey a wholly different impression, and show
that the primary object was that of mixing different charges
for the purpose of securing uniformity in the metal when discharged into the converters. This appears still plainer in the
claim appended to this specification: "The process hereinbefore
described, which consists in storing charges of molten metal in
a covered receptacle provided with a heat-retaining lining, removing portions only of the molten contents of the said receptacle, without entirely draining or emptying the same, and
successively replenishing the receptacle with fresh additions of
molten metal, whereby the character of the several charges of
metal so treated is equalized; substantially as described." The
word "storing" was evidently used in the sense of pouring the
metal into the reservoir or mixer, as essential to the maintenance of a dominant pool therein. The application was evidently considered as not sufficiently differentiating this from
former patents, and was rejected upon reference to the Witherow patents and to Kirk's Founding of Metals. Certain slight
amendments were then made in the specification; the claim
verbally changed, and an argument submitted to the effect that
the purpose of the Witherow patent was "to receive and store
the molten metal for the purpose of preventing the detention,
incident to the necessity of discharging the contents of the blast
furnace when there is no converter ready to receive it;" whereas
the distinctive idea of the Jones patent was "to have a receptacle capable of holding metal in a molten condition into which,
metal, it may be from several blast furnaces, is run from time
to time, and from which metal is drawn for treatment in the
converters, or otherwise as required."

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

This was evidently considered as still too indefinite, and the
application was thought to be fully met by the description in
Kirk's Founding of Metals, and was rejected.
Thereupon the application was again amended, its present
phraseology adopted and the distinguishing feature of the invention more clearly set forth. Without further suggestion the
application was allowed and the patent issued.
It is true the process is described in the second claim as a
"method of mixing molten metal," from which we are asked to
infer that it was intended to include the products of cupola as
well as of blast furnaces, whereas in the very first sentence of
the specification it is stated that "in practice it is found that
metal tapped from different blast furnaces is apt to vary considerably in chemical composition. . . . Especially is this
so in the process of refining crude iron from the smelting fur-

nace and charged directly into the converter without remelting
in a cupola, and, although such direct process possesses many
economic advantages, it has on this account been little practiced." The first claim of the patent is expressly for an improvement in the art of refining iron directly from the smelting furnace. The second claim apparently extends to the art
of mixing all molten metals, but the specification, taken in connection with the disclaimer, which describes a process designed
to dispense with the use of cupolas, shows that it was intended
to include metal tapped from blast furnaces and was probably
intended to be limited to that. Whether the claim would be
void if construed to include cupola metal, it is unnecessary
to consider. It clearly includes metal from blast furnaces, and
is not rendered void by the possibility of its including cupola
metal. The claim of a patent must always be explained by
and read in connection with the specification, and as this claim
clearly includes metal taken from blast furnaces, the question
whether it includes every molten metal is as much eliminated
from our consideration in this case as if it were sought to show
that the word "metal" might include other metals than iron.
Were infringement charged in the use of an apparatus for mixing cupola metal, the question would be squarely presented
whether the claim had been illegally expanded beyond the specification.

Opinion of the Court.

Much ingenuity and many words have been expended in an
endeavor to prove that the plaintiff and defendant, as well as
the courts, differed widely in their construction of the patent
and of what Jones was trying to accomplish. Upon the theory
of the defendant the Circuit Court "did not attempt to construe
the patent in any proper sense, but bent all its energies to wrest
and torture the plain English of the patent into a meaning
diametrically opposed to that which it bears on its face," and
to make it appear that the great trouble at the time Mr. Jones
conceived his invention arose, not from any lack of uniformity
in the percentages of silicon and sulphur, but were solely the
natural difficulties incident to abrupt variations in the percentage of silicon present; and that his statement that the trouble
in the Bessemerizing operation, which was the thing Jones had
in mind to obviate, was absolutely irreconcilable with the specification of the patent, because the sole object stated by Jones
was to secure products, whether of Bessemer steel or otherwise,
which would be practically hom.6geneous and substantially uniform in their contained sulphur and silicon, results which can
only be obtained by mixing the iron to a substantial uniformity.
Defendant further states its view of the case as follows:
"If, as a matter of fact, Mr. Jones at the time he applied for
his patent, had in view not only the process described by him
for securing uniformity in the admixture of silicon and sulphur,
but also another process, similar to that now used by the -plaintiff and defendant, and by means of which the operation of
Bessemerizing iron was made,

without securing uniit is manifestly clear

from his patent and from all the surrounding facts that he deliberately and carefully suppressed any disclosure of this invention in his specification."
One of the arguments that this was the case was that if Jones
"believed the method of use by which abrupt variations in
silicon could be avoided without securing uniformity in product,
to be a patentable invention, there was even more reason for
carefully suppressing all suggestion of such a mode of use in the
patent for the manipulation to obtain uniformproducts,because

the two processes are obviously alternative and inconsistent with

Opinion of the Court.

each other, incapable of being claimed in one application, and
therefore disclosure might have worked a loss of a possible
grant of the patent for the alternative mode of use."
It is true that its construction of the patent was pressed upon
the courts by the defendant with great earnestness and elaborateness of detail, and appears to have created an impression
of its soundness upon the Circuit Court of Appeals, but the Circuit Court did not seem to look upon it as the turning point of
the case, nor do we regard it as at all decisive. It seems to
assume that the second claim can only be met by evidence of
absolute uniformity of product, whereas all that is claimed is a
uniformity in the constituent parts of molten metal preparatory
to further treatment. In other words, to make it fit for further
treatment in the converters, without the necessity of remelting
in the cupola furnaces. Or, as stated by the District Judge,
"It is therefore plain that with a mixer thus operated, it is
possible to have wide variations in the composition of the blastfurnace metal charges added, and at the same time the successive withdrawals for the Bessemer converter show quite small
and gradual changes of composition. The heat of the detained
mass is affected by the incoming charges from the blast furnace,
but the heat of such addition, whether relatively high or low,
must mingle with, be modified by and average with the larger
and dominant mass."
With regard to this portion of the opinion, counsel for defendant observes:
"The judge of Circuit Court, having lost sight of the statutory requirements as to a full, clear and concise statement of
the invention, and having persuaded himself that it was his
judicial duty to find a way if possible to protect the Carnegie
Company in his monopoly of what Mr. Gayley and his colleagues claim ought to have been the invention described in
the patent, adopted the ingenious view that the patent was to
be construed as though it disclosed and covered two inventions,
one having for its object to obtain a product substantially uniform in its contained silicon and sulphur, and the other having
for its object the improvement in the operation of Bessemerizing iron which is incident to an avoidance in the success'vo
charges of abrupt variations in contained silicon."

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

435

Opinion of the Court.

We have not, however, been able to persuade ourselves that
the two processes are so alternative and inconsistent with each
other as to render them mutually destructive, or to justify counsel in charging the District Judge with an abdication of his
judicial duty of deciding the case according to what he believed
to be the law and the facts. We dismiss the subject with the
simple observation that much more seems to have been made
of it than it deserves, and that a reference to the second claim
shows its object was to secure uniformity of the molten metal
in its constituent parts preparatory to its further treatment,
by which further treatment we are to understand the Besseiierizing process of converting metal into steel, and that any
step in that direction would necessarily lead to an avoidance
of abrupt variations in silicon and sulphur, while such avoidance
of abrupt variations would in their turn only tend toward a
greater uniformity of product.
Some criticism was made upon the action of the court in permitting a disclaimer of certain clauses in the specification,
printed above in italics, which was made after the argument
and upon the petition of the plaintiff, "that at the hearing of
this cause it was taken by surprise by the argument of the defendant that the portions of the specification now disclaimed
enlarged the scope of the invention of the said letters patent
beyond what your petitioner believes to be the import of the
claims thereof." Upon the hearing defendant seems to have
insisted that certain portions of the specifications were broader
than the second claim. Those parts of the specification therefore were disclaimed. As we had occasion to observe in Sessions v. liomadka, 145 U. S. 29, "the power to disclaim is a
beneficial one, and ought not to be denied except where it is
resorted to for a fraudulent and deceptive purpose." In that
case the plaintiff was permitted to enter a disclaimer of all the
claims but the one in suit, the patentee having included in the
patent more devices than properly could be the subject of a
single patent. In the case under consideration the disclaimer
was not of a claim but of certain statements in the specification,
which if retained might be construed to have the effect of illegally broadening the second claim. The first statement dis-

Opinion of the Court.

claimed was that the invention might be practiced by merely
receiving a number of small portions of metal taken from different ladles, the mixing being performed merely by the act of
pouring into the charging ladle. The use of the word "merely"
ignored the steps embodied in the second claim, where the mixing is not performed by merely pouring together the several
charges into a ladle, but by maintaining a permanent quantity
of metal in the reservoir, to which charges were alternately
added and from which they were withdrawn. The other clauses
were intended to disclaim the casting of the metal into pigs.
We think there is no force in the criticism that a disclaimer
may not extend to a part of the specification, as well as to a
distinct claim. Jlurlbut v. S&killinger, 130 U. S. 456; S&hillinger v. Gunther, 17 Blatch. 66; Schwai'tzwalder v. New York

disclaimer been to reform or alter the description of the invention, or convert the claim from one thing into something else,
itinight have been objectionable, as patents can only be amended
for mistakes of this kind by a reissue. But the disclaimer in
this case appears to have been made to obviate an ambiguity
in the specification, and with no idea of obtaining the benefit
of a reissue. If the clauses had the effect of broadening the
patent the disclaimer removes the objection. If they did not,
the disclaimer could do no harm, and cannot be made the subject of criticism.
It is insisted, too, that there is no mention in the second claim
of a dominant pool, and that the words, "removing portions
only of the composite molten contents of the receptacle without
entirely draining or emptying the same, and successively replenishing the receptacle with fresh ununiformn additions," are
satisfied by leaving a quantity of iron, however small, in the
reservoir, and that it really includes nothing that was not well
known before. It is true that neither the size of the reservoir
nor the amount of metal to be left therein, after each discharge
is made into the converter, is specified, but it is stated in the
specification that this reservoir may be of any convenient size,
"holding, say, one hundred tons of metal (more or less)," with
the bottom of the discharge spout some distance above the bot-

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

431

Opinion of the Court.

tom of the vessel, "say, two feet in a hundred ton tank, and
more or less according to the capacity of the vessel, the purpose
of which is that when the metal is poured out of the spout a
considerable quantity may always be left remaining and unpoured, and that whenever the vessel is replenished there may
already be contained in it a body of molten metal with which
the fresh addition may mix." Though the size of the reservoir
and the considerable quantity left therein as a dominant pool
might have been described more definitely, (but perhaps at the
risk of an infringement being avoided by one using a receiver
of a different size containing a different quantity,) we think it
is impossible to read this patent without gathering from it the
dominant idea of Jones not to describe a reservoir for storage,
with or without incidental mixing, but to provide a receptacle
the main, if not the sole, object of which is to preserve therein
a large and constant quantity of molten iron as a basis for a
gradual unification of the product of several blast furnaces, or
of several casts from the same furnace, and herein distinguishing it from all prior inventions. The specification of the patent
is not addressed to lawyers, or even to the public generally, but
to the manufacturers of steel, and any description which is sufficient to apprise them in the language of the art of the definite
feature of the invention, and to serve as a warning to others of
what the patent claims as a monopoly, is sufficiently definite to
sustain the patent. He may assume that what was-already
known in the art of manufacturing steel was known to them,
and, as observed by Mr. Justice Bradley, in Wfrebster Zoom Co.
v. Higgins, 105 U. S. 580, 586, "He may begin at the point
where his invention begins, and describe what he has made,
that is new, and what it replaces of the old. That which is
common and well known is as if it were written out in the patent and delineated in the drawings." We think this second
claim not only describes with sufficient clearness the purpose of
the patent to secure uniformity of the molten metal in its constituent parts preparatory to further treatment, but read with
the specification sufficiently describes the process by which this
uniformity may be secured, by always preserving in the reservoir
a sufficient quantity of molten metal to secure such uniformity

Opinion of the Court.

of product. It is undoubtedly true that the storage feature
appeared more prominently in the specification which was first
rejected upon the ground that it was not sufficiently differentiated from prior patents, than in that which was finally accepted,
but there is nothing to indicate that Jones did not understand
from the first that the distinguishing feature of his invention
was the preservation of a considerable quantity of iron in the
reservoir.
3. The question of infringement only remains to be considered, and, in the view we have taken of the prior devices,
presents no serious difficulty. The Court of Appeals was of
opinion that "the defendant's reservoir, or accumulating ladle
complained of, is the same in principle as one which has been
in use at the Cambria works ever since Bessemer steel was first
manufactured there, with only this difference, that at first it
was used at cupola, now at furnace." If such were the fact, of
course defendant would not be open to the charge of infringement. Undoubtedly it has the right to make use of all prior
devices, and particularly such as had been used at its own manufactory. In order to understand the device made use of by the
defendant prior to the Jones invention, we reproduce herewith
two small but easily understood cuts, taken from its brief, showing the character of the ladle known as the Bessemer Intermediate ladle, used by it and generally by all American mills
manufacturing steel by the Bessemer process.

It appears elsewhere in the testimony that the intermediate
reservoir or ladle was from fifteen to eighteen tons capacity,
and the converter from six to eight tons; that the molten metal

Opinion of the Court.

was tapped from the cupolas into the reservoir and withdrawn
for the converter, and as the intermediate ladle held considerably more than the amount of metal necessary to charge a converter, there was some incidental mixing; but the main and
perhaps the only purpose of the reservoir was for storage, and
that if any quantity of metal were left in the reservoir it was
by accident rather than by design. It will be noticed, too,
that the reservoir was open at the top. It does not appear to
have been made use of in carrying out what is known as the
direct process, the difference being that the cupola practice furnished a metal for the Bessemer converter that was uniform in
composition, or practically so, while the direct metal was largely
variable in composition.
The testimony further shows that, after the installation of
the Jones mixer at the Edgar Thomson works, Mr. Morgan, the
defendant's mechanical engineer, visited and inspected these
works and obtained information as to their practical operation,
and was advised by the superintendent as to the location and
proper size of the mixer and its contiguity to the converters.
Mlr. lvorgan does not deny this conversation, although he qualifies it by saying that he thought the Jones apparatus had grave
defects. Shortly after this visit, and in the latter part of 1895,
defendant installed an apparatus of its own for the operation
of the direct process, which is herewith produced upon a small
scale, and in comparison with the Jones process. It consisted
of a covered refractory lined and turtle-shaped vessel of about

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

through a spout on the other side, was poured into a ladle,
which supplied the Bessemer converters. The metal was supplied both from blast furnaces and cupolas, the former furnishing about two thirds, the latter about one third of the metal
used; but the metal from the cupola system was delivered by
a ladle to the converter direct, and not through the reservoir.
The metal from the blast furnace entered the reservoir in about
fifteen-ton ladle lots, and was withdrawn in approximately
twelve-ton lots. The chief engineer of the company states that
"in accordance with the natural way of using the reservoir, it
is ordinarily kept well filled up." That in the practical operation of the mixer or reservoir a large quantity of iron was retained for mixing purposes is evident from the fact that a chalk
mark was made on the side of the mixer, which was not allowed to run below the floor, as a guide to the men who rotated
or tilted the mixer, since, if the mark went below the floor and
out of sight, they could not tell how much iron was left in the
mixer. Under these instructions not to allow the chalk mark
to go below the floor there was retained in the mixer about 175
tons of molten metal, amply sufficient for the purposes stated
in the Jones patent. Its principle of construction was similar
to that of the Jones mixer, and its operation identical. Indeed,
defendant's engineer himself says: "With the exception of additions of cupola metal I do not know that there is any material difference between our practice and that described in the
second claim" of the Jones patent. We agree, in the opinion
of the Circuit Court, that "it is quite clear, in view of these
facts, that infringement takes place. That initial mixing rather
than storage is the purpose of the reservoir is shown by the
fact that the cupola metal is not stored, but served direct in
ladles to the converter plant. And that the homogeneous mixture, once obtained, is used as a dominant pool to produce a
giaduated, non-abrupt product, is shown by.the chalk line minimum limit of 175 tons. With such a permanent dominant
pool in constant use, we are clear that respondent's practice infringed the second claim of the Jones patent in both letter and
spirit."
If the contents of the mixer used by defendant were allowed

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

441

Opinion of the Court.

habitually to become empty in carrying out its process, there
would be no infringement; but all the evidence contradicts
this. In the Jones practice this cannot be done, since the mixer
cannot be tilted beyond a certain point. In the defendant's
mixer it can be done, but is not, since the operator is not allowed
to tilt it beyond a certain point gauged by a chalk mark. This
seems to be the only foundation for the charge so frequently
reiterated, and in varying language, that the methods in use
before the Jones process deprived that process of all novelty,
and if novelty existed it was by reason of the varying modes
of executing such methods; the inference from this being that
as the Jones method was old, it could only be treated as new
because of the conduct of individuals in applying the method
and their intentions, and that this reduces itself to the proposition that the Jones patent rests upon the mere intention or
minds of persons. If we understand this argument correctly,
it is that the prior method contemplated storing only, and the
mixing was but an incident, while the Jones patent contemplates mixing as its main object and storage only as an incident.
This proposition that the application of this patent depends
upon the individual intent of the operator overlooks the essential nature of a process patent. The directions and specifications of such a patent are addressed to those engaged and skilled
in the art. It professes to disclose a method of procedure, not
the particular instrumentality that may be employed. It may
be, as suggested, that one person may, and in ignorance of the
patented method, make use of a reservoir merely as such, and
without any desire to avail himself of the patented process;
but such a fact would not deprive the discoverer of the process
of the protection of his patent. Such a supposed case might
present a question of fact for a court or jury, and if it were
made to appear that the party charged with infringement had,
as in this case, changed the instrumentalities used by him after
a new method had been disclosed, and particularly if he had for
the first time used a special device necessary to that process, a
jury might well refuse to believe and find that the defendant
was only following the old methods of procedure, and not seeking to avail himself of the plaintiff's invention.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

But we think the difference in the two processes may be illustrated by a very simple example: Let us imagine a reservoir
containing, say, three quarts, and filled with one quart each, of
three liquids of different constituent parts, and withdrawn for
further treatment at the rate of one or two quarts at a time.
Necessarily there would be some incidental mixing, but it
would occur at once that the main object of the reservoir
was a retention of a sufficient quantity of the mixture to supply the receptacle for further treatment, and if no necessity
existed for a longer retention of the liquid in the reservoir, it
could be very quickly emptied by two discharges into the receiving vessel. Now, let us substitute for this reservoir a cask
of, say, 60 quarts, into which the liquids of different constituent parts are poured in at one end from a multitude of receptacles, and discharged at the other end after remaining a certain
time in the cask, and that this cask could not be tilted so far
but what a quantity of liquid would be left within it amounting, say, to half its capacity. Now, if there be no distinction
between these two operations there would be little left to the
Jones process, the very vitality of which consists in the size of
the cask relative to the ladles and the mixing of the various
liquids poured into it before they are withdrawn.
If, as insisted by the defendant and found by the Court of
Appeals, the reservoir now used is the same in principle as the
one which had been in use at the Cambria Iron Works ever
since the Bessemer steel was first manufactured there, and the
same were adequate for the purposes of the direct process, why
was any change made? Therein we think the Court of Appeals
made its most serious error. The defendant had an unquestioned
right to manufacture steel, as it had been accustomed to do;
but instead of that it abandons the Bessemer uncovered ladle
of twelve to eighteen tons, and adopts a covered refractory
lined reservoir of 300 tons capacity, and makes use of it, not
as before, for the storage of cupolu metal, but for the mixing
of Zdastfurnace metal according to the direct process. This,
too, was done immediately after Mr. Morgan's visit to plaintiff's works.
It is true that with the growth of the production of furnaces

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

443

Opinion of the Court.

from fifty tons a day in 1872 to four or five hundred tons in
1895 all apparatus would naturally be increased in size; but
why was the open reservoir theretofore used for cupola metal
provided with a cover and enlarged in its capacity from fifteen
to three hundred tons-twentyfold, while the converter was
little more than doubled in size? Why was it so operated that
175 tons were left in the mixer as a dominant pool, if no infringement were contemplated ? In the face of these facts the
question so earnestly pressed by the defendant, whether the
" method of mixing molten metal," covered by the second
claim, was one for securing a substantial homogeneous composition of metal, to the end of getting a practically uniform
product, or was one simply for the purpose of preventing sudden variations in the compositions of successive small portions
drawn from the reservoir, without attaining substantial uniformity, loses most of its significance. We do not know how
the process can be better described than in the specification itself: "To provide means for rendering the product of steel
works uniform in chemical composition." The variations in
such composition are said to be "particularly in silicon and
sulphur," and the process to be one of mixing, whereby the
particles of metal "are diffused or commingled thoroughly
among each other, and the entire charge is practically homogeneous in composition, representing in each part "an average
of a variety of uniform constituent parts, all the charges of
the converter from time to time will be substantially uniform."
This, denuded of all hypercriticism, is the object of the Jones
invention, which seems to be the only one yet devised for carrying on what is known as the direct process. If it be true
that this process cannot be carried on without infringing the
Jones patent, he is certainly entitled to a monopoly of the invention. If it can be, then every method theretofore known
for carrying on such process was open to the defendant. But
we think the change from the Bessemer intermediate label to
the Jones mixer was a radical one, and was made for a purpose.
That purpose was clearly the adoption of the Jones process.
It is true that before the facts were fully ascertained, a stipulation was signed to the effect that the "amount of molten

OCTOBER TERMI,

Opinion of the Court.

metal in said mixer (defendant's) varies from nothing to its full
capacity, depending on the supply and demand, the supply
being generally sufficient to keep the mixer more than half full
of molten metal, which metal remains molten therein." It appears, however, that upon the facts being more fully ascertained, notice was given that in so far as the stipulation varied
from the facts appearing in the testimony of defendant's expert,
it would be repudiated, and particularly that portion wherein
it was said, "that the amount of the molten metal in the mixer
varies from nothing to its full capacity." As it clearly appears
from the mouths of defendant's own witnesses (notably -Mr.
Morgan) that, in the usual operation of the mixer, the ordinary
amount of metal kept in the reservoir was more than one half
its capacity, we think that plaintiff's case should not be prejudiced by this stipulation. Stipulations are ordinarily entered
into for the purpose of saving time, trouble or expense, and in
this case it recites that "as defendant's counsel is expected to
sail for Europe in a few days and may not be back for about
four months, it is therefore stipulated by counsel for both parties, to save delay, as follows." But while the stipulation is
undoubtedly admissible in evidence it ought not to be used as
a pitfall, and where the facts subsequently developed show,
with respect to a particular matter, that it was inadvertently
signed, we think that upon giving notice in sufficient time to
prevent prejudice to the opposite party, counsel may repudiate
any fact inadvertently incorporated therein. This practice has
been frequently upheld in this and other courts.

In short, we are clearly of opinion that the reservoir now in
use is used for entirely different purposes from the intermediate
Bessemer ladle formerly employed; that the process carried
on with it is identical with the Jones invention, and that its
primary, if not its sole use, is for mixing purposes, with necessarilv incidental storage, while the Bessemer intermediate ladle
was solely used for storage, with little, if any, thought of the
advantages to be gained by an incidental mixing.

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

445

Opinion of the Court.

Discarding now all that does not bear directly upon the
validity of the Jones patent, and dropping all superfluity of
words, let us determine exactly what Jones has contributed, if
anything, to the art of making steel. He undoubtedly found
reservoirs of small size in use in which were poured from receiving ladles enough molten metal to fill them, and from which
a sufficient amount was discharged to supply a converter, usually about half the size of the reservoir. But in all these cases
the fact whether any particular amount of metal was left in
the reservoir was treated as a matter of indifference or accident, although there must have been necessarily some incidental
mixing; and probably the metal as it. ran into the converters
approximated more nearly to uniformity than when it ran into
the reservoir. The former methods were adequate for cupola
metal, uniformity in which had been largely secured by a care-ful selection and breaking up of the pigs, but it had not proved
a success for blast furnace metal, except that it had been used
to a very limited extent in foreign countries where the peculiar
character of the iron ore had rendered it possible to carry on
a direct process, although apparently by methods quite other
than those employed by Jones. The principal step employed
by Jones was to magnify the capacity of the reservoir about
twentyfold, provide it with a cover, and to arrange that it
should not be tilted beyond a certain point, in order that a
"considerable quantity" of molten metal might be retained in
it for a sufficient time to accomfplish a pretty thorough mixing,
but little change having been made in the meantime in the size
of the receiving ladles and converters. As the reservoir was
designed to hold a large quantity of metal for a considerable
time it must have been covered to obviate the contents being
crusted over or skulled.
As soon as this method had proven to be successful by employment at the Edgar Thomson works, and had become so
well known as to attract the attention of other manufacturers
of steel, it found a ready sale, was adopted by all the leading
manufacturers in this country, and was sold for use abroad for
about $50,000.
It should be borne in mind that this process was one not

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
WHITE, J., FULLER, 0. J., HARLAN and BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

accidentally discovered, but was the result of a long search for
the very purpose. The surprise is that the manufacturers of
steel, having felt the want for so many years, should never have
discovered from the multiplicity of patents and of processes
introduced into this suit, and well known to the manufacturers
of steel, that it was but a step from what they already knew
to that which they had spent years in endeavoring to find out.
It only remains now for the wisdom which comes after the fact
to teach us that Jones discovered nothing, invented nothing,
accomplished nothing.
We cannot better conclude this opinion than by the following extract from the opinion of Mr. Justice Bradley in Loom
Co. v. Hfiggins, 105 U. S. 580, 591: "But it is plain from the
evidence, and from the very fact that it was not sooner adopted
and used, that it did not, for years, occur in this light to even
the most skillful persons. It may have been under their very
eyes, they may almost be said to have stumbled over it; but
they certainly failed to see it, to estimate its value, and to bring
it into notice.
Now that it has stcceeded, it may seem
very plain to any one that he could have done it as well. This
is often the case with inventions of the greatest merit. It may
be laid down as a general rule, though perhaps not an invariable one, that if a new combination and arrangement of known
elements produce a new and beneficial result, never attained
before, it is evidence of invention."
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

WHITE, J., FULLER, 0. J., HARLAN and BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

cern the manufacture of steel by what is known as the Bessemer
method, to which the court now declares the patent in suit
solely relates.
Into the stack of a smelting furnace iron ore, with suitable
fluxing material and fuel, was introduced. In the operation of
the furnace the ore was reduced to a metallic state by the oxidizing action of carbon or gas containing carbon. This metallic iron melted in the lower part of the furnace, taking up a
proportion of carbon and other ingredients, dropping to the
bottom of the hearth as molten pig iron. The earthy impurities combined with the flux, and were also melted and descended
into the hearth, resting upon the top of the molten metal. The
molten metal was drawn from the hearth from time to time by
tapping, and the molten impurities, combined with the flux,
forming a cinder, were also drawn from the hearth at a higher
level.. As the molten iron was tapped it was run out into molds
and came to be known as pig iron or pigs. These pigs were
not of uniform composition, because of the varying quantity of
the constituents contained in the ore and the chemical changes
wrought by irregularities incidental to the operation of the
furnace.
To make foundry castings, pigs were selected, broken up,
charged into a cupola furnace, reduced to a molten state, and
the liquid was drawn off into a receiving ladle. From this the
quantity desired was tipped into a smaller vessel, known as a
casting ladle, and was poured into the molds. Where more
than one cupola furnace was employed each was tapped and
the metal poured through a groove into a receiving ladle, common to the furnaces, where it was held for use, and drawn as
required into a casting ladle and carried to the molds, as already
mentioned.
In 1855 and 1856, Sir Henry Bessemer obtained various patents covering his discovery for producing malleable iron and
steel by forcing currents of air through molten iron. The appliance described was a refactory lined vessel, called by Bessemer a converting vessel, which came to be designated as the
converter or the vessel. Without going into detail, it suffices
to say that, for various reasons the method of Sir Henry Besse-

mer proved not to be as advantageous as had been expected.
Indeed, it was not until Mushet patented a method of decarbonizing iron by completely blowing it and adding ferromanganese or speigel-eisen in a molten state that the difficulty of
producing steel was solved, and the process of Sir Henry Bessemer was rendered practical. Despite, however, the fact that
Mushet's discovery was of immense value and rendered Bessemer's conceptions a commercial success, Mushet allowed his
patent right to lapse through neglect to pay the requisite fees
in the third year; and (to quote the language of the author of
the article on Iron, contained in Encyclopoedia Britannica, 9th
ed. vol. 13, p. 312) "in consequence his name is all but forgotten
in connection with his improvement on Bessemer's own process,
the combination being ordinarily termed ' Bessenerizing.'"
In the manufacture of steel by the Bessemer-Mushet process
two methods were followed: one termed the indirect, the other
the direct. In the indirect, pigs were charged into a reverberatory furnace, for which, at a later date, a cupola furnace was
substituted. In such furnace the pigs were melted and run into
ladles or reservoirs, and thence the molten iron was conveyed
to the converter for the necessary treatment. Without attemnpting to give accurately the variations in the size and consequent capacity of cupola furnaces and converters, it is unquestioned that the quantity of molten metal which could be drawn
at a single tapping from the cupola was usually not adequate
to supply a full charge to the converter. It followed that ordinarily more than one cupola furnace was used to supply a
converter, and that the tappings from such cupolas were drawn
into a common reservoir, or ladle, and there stored until required
to be carried to the converter. Indeed, irrespective of the necessity of storing the tappings, growing out of the difference
between the capacities of the vessels in question, such storage
was additionally required in order that the operation might be
continuous, in case of delay resulting from accident to the converter or otherwise.
In the direct process the capacity of blast furnaces greatly
exceeded that of cupola furnaces. The molten iron was tapped
directly from the blast furnace into a number of receiving reservoirs or ladles, and carried for treatment to the converter.

On October 31, 1888, William R. Jones made application for
two letters patent, one stated to be for a new and useful improvement in apparatus "for mixing molten pig metal," the
other for a process declared to be "a new and useful improvement in methods of mixing molten pig metal." The application for the first or apparatus patent was several times rejected,
and, after various amendments, was finally allowed. This patent may be dismissed from view, as it is not involved in this
controversy. The first application for the process patentwhich is the patent under consideration in this case-was rejected. Thereupon a new and amended application was presented. This was also rejected, when a second amendment was
made, and the application was finally allowed.
As the opinion of the court has reproduced the specifications
and claims of the patent, it is unnecessary to repeat them in
detail, and therefore a mere outline of them is now given. The
patent was entitled "Method of Mixing Molten Pig Metal."
The primary object of the invention was stated to be "to provide means for rendering the product of steel works uniform
in chemical composition." It was also stated that: "My invention is not limited to its use in connection with converters,
since similar advantages may be obtained by casting the metal
from the mixing vessels into pigs for use in converters, puddling furnaces, or for any other uses to which pig iron may be
put in the art." It was further stated that "My invention may
be practiced with a variety of forms of apparatus-for example,
by merely receiving in a charging ladle a number of small portions of metal taken from several ladles or receiving vessels containing crude metal obtained at different times or from different
furnaces, mixing being performed merely by the act of pouring
into the charging ladle, and other like means may be employed."
It was, however, declared that it was preferable to use the
device covered by the apparatus patent, and a description of
the same was set out. That device may be thus described: It
consisted of a covered tilting tank of large size, "holding, say,
one hundred tons of metal (more or less,)" lined so as "to retain the heat of the molten contents of the vessel and to prevoL. CLxxxv-29

vent chilling thereof," with receiving and charging spouts, a
gas-heating appliance contained in the discharging spout, and
so constructed that, after being fully charged with molten metal,
drawn from the furnaces into ladles and poured into the reservoir, as the metal was poured out for use a considerable residue
would remain in the reservoir to mix with an incoming charge.

The patent embodied two claims which read as follows:
"1. In the art of refining iron directly from the smelting
furnace, the process of equalizing the chemical composition of
the crude metal by thoroughly commingling or mixing together
.the liquid metal charge and subsequently refining the mixed
and equalized charge, substantially as and for the purposes described.
"2. In the art of mixing molten metal to secure uniformity
of the same in its constituent parts preparatory to further treatment, the process of introducing into a mixing receptacle successive portions of molten metal ununiform in their non-metallic
constituents, (sulphur, silicon, etc.,) removing portions only of
the composite molten contents of the receptacle without entirely draining or emptying the same, and successively replenishing the receptacle with fresh ununiform additions, substantially as and for the purposes described."
On December 2, 1895, the Carnegie Steel Company, Limited,
which had acquired full title to the Jones patents, commenced
the present suit against the Cambria Iron Company, for an
alleged infringement of the foregoing process patent. The defences made by the answer were substantially a denial of infringement, and an averment of want of patentable novelty.
After the evidence for the defendant was all in and several
witnesses had been examined in rebuttal, the complainant, on
March 30, 1897, stated "that at the hearing of the cause he will
urge infringement of the second claim only of the patent in
suit." At the close of all the evidence the complainant filed
what is termed a "Petition for Disclaimer," praying that the
court would receive in evidence a certified copy of a disclaimer
of portions of the specifications, which on that day had been
sent to the Patent Office for filing. The trial court admitted
the disclaimer in evidence. The portions of the specifications

WHITE, J., FULLER, C. J., HARLAN and BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

covered by the disclaimer are printed in italics in the patent as
reproduced in the opinion of the court. The disclaimer need
not be further noticed at this time.
It was shown beyond question that in November, 1895, the
defendant had erected at its works a reservoir of the capacity
of about 300 tons, for the storage of molten metal drawn from
its blast furnaces, the metal so stored being held in the reservoir for the purpose of treatment in the converters. This reservoir was described by a witness in the following condensed
manner: "It was cylindrical in shape, with slightly convex
ends, and in turning (for the purpose of pouring out the metal)
it revolves upon the center of the cylinder. It is supported
upon cradles of rollers and the motion is imparted to the reservoir by hydraulic cylinders." As this cause, as already stated,
does not involve the Jones apparatus patent, no question of infringement of the mechanical device embraced in such patent
can possibly arise. In this reservoir the molten metal as tapped
from the furnaces was stored continuously and the reservoir
was drawn upon with like continuity to supply molten metal
for treatment in the converters. Whilst it is not asserted that
the use of the reservoir, as just stated, caused the metal stored
therein to become uniform in its chemical constituents, it is conceded that the method pursued counteracted the inconvenience
of sudden variations in the metal as drawn for converter purposes.
There is controversy, however, whether the defendant, in reservoiring its molten metal, irrespective of the supply and demand, intentionally retained in the reservoir a considerable
residuum. From the view taken by me, however, it is unnecessary to pass on this contention, since the principles deemed by
me applicable to the cause will be wholly unaffected, even if it
be conceded that the defendant in operating its reservoir, in filling it with molten metal and in drawing the same off for use in
the converter, designedly held in the reservoir a considerable
residuum of molten metal in order that the metal which was
subsequently charged into the reservoir might commingle with
that retained.
The cause was decided by the Circuit Court in favor of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.

complainant. The court held: That the second claim of the
patent referred alone to metal direct from the blast furnace intended to be Bessemerized in a converter, and that the object
was, not the obtaining, by mixing, a molten metal substantially
uniform in its chemical constituents, but the avoidance of abrupt
variations between the various charges supplied to the converter.
The patent was construed as not contemplating the mixing of
batches of metal, that is, the filling up of the apparatus and a
drawing down to a "residue" before replenishing. The gist of
the Jones idea was stated to be "the creation and maintenance
of a great pool of metal between the blast furnaces and converters, through which all the incoming and outgoing metal
must pass," by which means abrupt variations were prevented,
although neither a uniform molten metal nor a uniform product was thereby obtainable. Indeed, the court said: "In Jones,
uniformity is a non-essential; in fact, a non-attainable attribute
of product, and is a necessary non-sequence of material used."
Whilst the court found that reservoiring was well known in
the art at the time the Jones patent was obtained, and that
mixing necessarily resulted from such reservoiring, it held that
the Jones method was patentable, because the reservoiring
known to the art contemplated storage, and not the prevention
of abrupt variations; that although a mixing of the metals was
of course the inevitable result of the reservoiring, such fact did
not preclude the validity of the Jones patent, because prior to its
grant the mixing arising from reservoiring was incidental to
storage, whilst under the Jones method the storage was incidental to the mixing. The court said:
"XNow that mixing of some character took place in the ladle
during these operations, that where it took place the resultant
was a homogeneous average of all constituent ingredients contained, are facts to gainsay which would be to question nature's
laws; but the indisputable fact remains that such mixing was
accidental, eccentric and non-systematic, and, therefore, not of
a systematic, regular, functional type or for a systematic, functional purpose."
A decree was entered reciting that the patent in question
was valid as to the second claim thereof; that the defendant,

C. J.,

and

BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

"by reason of the use of a certain method of mixing molten
pig metal, as in the said complainant's bill set forth, has infringed the said recited letters patent as to the second claim
thereof, and has violated the exclusive rights of the said complainant thereunder." It was adjudged that recovery be had
of the gains and profits made by the defendant and the damages sustained by complainant, and a master was appointed to
ascertain the amount of such gains, profits and damages. The
defendant was, in general terms, enjoined from any further infringement of the second claim of the letters patent and of the
exclusive rights of the complainant thereunder.
An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That
court held that the second claim of the patent did not cover
the retention in reservoiring of a considerable residuum, even
though the same was designated as a dominant pool, and if it
did that the method was not patentable in view of the state of
the art, and that the proceedings in the Patent Office demonstrated that this was in effect conceded by Jones. It was decided that the defendant had the right to reservoir its molten
metal, and that its method of doing so did not infringe the patent. The court decided that the disclaimer was not warranted
by the statute, but that in any event it was ineffective to alter
the true meaning of the patent. Thereupon the decree of the
Circuit Court was reversed.
This court now reverses the decree of the Circuit Court of
Appeals, adopts the views of the Circuit Court, and in effect
affirms the decree of that court. The court expressly upholds
the theory of a dominant pool, and decides that the Jones patent
related, not to the obtaining of uniform molten metal by mixing
in a reservoir, and a resultant uniform product, but solely to
the procuring by means of reservoiring, molten metal which
would not abruptly vary in its chemical constituents when
drawn from the reservoir for use in a converter. The opinion
of this court now, as did that of the Circuit Court, expressly
concedes that reservoiring of molten metal was well known in
the art at the time the Jones patent was applied for, and that
mixing was the inevitable result of such reservoiring, but it is
decided that this fact did not operate to deprive the Jones

method of novelty or to relieve the defendant from the charge
of infringement.
My mind is unable to assent to the construction which the
court affixes to the patent, and as it is conceded that the method
used by the defendant does not infringe, unless the patent has
the import which the court has givdi to it, the reasons for my
dissent would perhaps be most directly made manifest by stating what seems to me to be the true construction of the patent.
Doing so, however, is for the moment pretermitted for two
reasons: 1. Because to my mind it seems that even if it be
granted, arguendo, that the patent is susceptible of the construction which the court has placed upon it, on the face of the
opinion, the conclusion reached is wrong; in other words, the
opinion of the court to me seems self-destructive. 2. Because
if the concession of the court be accepted, that reservoiring and
mixing were well known in the art, then it follows, from a
consideration of the record, that the patent, as construed by
the court, was wanting in patentable novelty. That is to say,
if the admissions of fact made in the opinion of the court are
right, its conclusion is demonstrated by the record to be unsound.
Let me briefly advert to the opinions of this courtand of the
Circuit Court, to point out the reasons which constrain to the
first proposition just stated. The Circuit Court concluded that
the reservoiring of molten metal from cupola and blast furnaces
for use in casting or in converters was well known to the art
at the time the Jones patent was applied for. It also declared
as follows: "That mixing of some character took place in the
ladle during these operations; that where it took place the
resultant was a homogeneous average of all constituent ingredients contained, are facts to gainsay which would be to question nature's laws." But this was held not to establish that at
the time the Jones method was patented. that method as now
construed was known to the art or had been anticipated, because, in the prior practice, the mixing "was accidental, eccentric and non-systematic, and therefore not of a systematic,
regular, functional type, or for a systematic, functional purpose;" that such mixing was incidental to storage, whilst in

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

455

WHITE, J., FULLER, C. J., HARLAW and BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

the Jones method storage was incidental to mixing. This
court approvingly adopts and elaborately restates these views.
Now, my reason does not enable me to conceive how, consistently with the view of the prior state of the art as to mixto
ing and reservoiring -which is admitted, the conclusion as
the patentability of the Jones method as construed can be sustained.
It would seem to be beyond question that, as it is held that
the mixing resulting from the storage as practiced prior to the
a
grant of the Jones patent, was the resultant, as stated, of
qualifying

words "accidental, eccentric, non-systematic, and functional
type or purpose" could only relate to the conduct of the per-,
sons who practiced the method prior to the Jones patent. This
must be, unless it can be said that a well-known law of nature
was accidental, eccentric, non-systematic and non-functional.
The qualifications then applying, not to the law of nature, but
to the conduct of parties, the reasoning must come to'this:
Although the method attributed to the Jones patent was well
known to the art at the time that patent was issued, and hence
it was intrinsically wanting in patentable novelty, nevertheless
such method must be held to have embodied invention because
the well known practice was carried out by individuals in a varying and irregular manner. But this is only to say that whilst
the Jones method was old, it must be treated as new because of
the conduct of individuals in applying the method and their
intentions. And this reduces itself to the proposition that the
Jones patent as construed covered the mere intention or mind
of persons. The reasoning is equally applicable to the distinction which is asserted to exist between storing and the mixing
incidental thereto, and mixing with incidental storage. The
mere form of expression cannot create a distinction where none
exists, or destroy a law of nature. As by me it cannot be conceived that various charges of molten metal can be stored in a
common reservoir without resulting mixing, it follows necessarily, by the law of diffusion of fluids, the mixing is the secondary result arising from and created by the primary act of storage.
It is impossible that the secondary force can be caused to be-

WHITE, J., FULLER, C. J., HARI.Ax and BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

come the first and creating power by a mere collocation of
words. If, then, the distinction has significance, as of course
it must have, since the court makes it the basis of its decision,
it can only mean this, that those who practiced the reservoiring of molten metal before the grant of the Jones patent
mainly contemplated storage, and did not in their minds take
into view the inevitable mixing, which would arise therefrom
by a law of nature; therefore, in the minds of the persons so
reservoiring the storage was the primary and the mixing the
incidental consequence. But, on the contrary, as those reservoiring metal after the Jones patent must be considered to have
contemplated, first, the advantages resulting from mixing, therefore, in their minds, the mixing is the principal and the storage
the accessory. But this is only again to say that whilst the Jones
method was old it is to be treated as new because it covered the
intention of those who stored metal for the purpose of use.
Aside from this, it seems to me the concession that the placing of molten metal in a reservoir for use as required was well
known at the time the Jones patent was issued, is inconsistent
with the ruling now made, that the Jones patent validly embraced the retention in a reservoir of a mass of such metal,
now described by the court as a dominant pool. The elementary import of tie right to reservoir, as applied not only to
molten metal, but other fluids, is the storing of the fluid for use
as required, and this implies the drawing off as desired, the replenishing at will, and the keeping of such residuum or reserve
supply as may be deemed best. It may not be doubted that to
say that one who stores fluid for use is obliged whenever he
draws any off to draw all off before replenishing, is to say that
such party has not the right to reservoir, if it be meant by
the court that the right to reservoir carries with it the right to
draw off or to retain at will, unless the person reservoiring intends to retain a residuum for a particular purpose, the reasoning
reduces itself again to the proposition that the Jones patent
covers, not the process described therein, but the mind and intention of the individual who may exercise the right to reservoir molten metal. That is to say, my reason does not enable
me to understand how the right to reservoir can be admitted,

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAM1BRIA IRON CO.
WHiTE, J., FULLER, C. J., HARLAN and BnEWE,

457

JJ., dissenting.

and yet such right be at once denied by a construction of the
patent which imposes qualifications on the right to reservoir,
which, in effect, renders its beneficial exercise impossible. In
other words, I fail to see how the exclusive right can be conferred to do the very thing which the court admits was well
known at the time the patent to Jones was issued. The conflict which my mind perceives between the facts admitted upon
the face of the opinion and its conclusion is expressly pointed
out by the opinion itself, where it is said: "If the contents of
the mixer used by the defendant were allowed habitually to become empty in carrying out its process there would be no infringement." That is, if in the use of its reservoir the defendant did not habitually retain a residuum there would be no infringement. But the admission that the occasional use of a
residue would be no infringement concedes that the patent did
not embrace the right to use a residue, for if it was covered by
the patent it would be an infringement to avail of it even occasionally. Thus it must follow that the exclusive right which
the court upholds is expressly declared to relate, not to the
process, but to the mere habit of the defendant.
For the purpose of demonstrating the second proposition previously adverted to, let me now recur to the state of the art as
depicted by the record, in order to point out that even if the
Jones patent embodied the process which the court now attributes to it, that process was wanting in patentable novelty. In
doing this, for convenience, the subject is thus divided: (a) the
use of molten metal drawn from cupolas for foundry purposes,
before the invention of Bessemer, as well as the foundry practice and the Bessemerizing practice by the indirect process
after such invention and before the grant of the Jones patent;
(b) the direct process of making steel from blast furnace metal
prior to the grant of the Jones patent.

1. The Whitney Car-wheel Practice: At the Whitney carwheel works in Philadelphia, commencing in 1847, remelted
pig metal from several cupola furnaces was tapped at intervals

into a large reservoir ladle, having a capacity of from twelve
to fifteen tons. From this the molten metal was poured into
charging ladles having a capacity of but six hundred pounds.
A considerable residue was always maintained in the reservoir
ladle. The principal purpose, as testified to by witnesses having personal knowledge of the subject, was to secure, as a consequence of the mixing resulting from the reservoiring, the
production of a practically uniform product. Excerpts from
the testimony of John R. Whitney contain a clear statement on

the subject:
"When the (large) ladle was nearly full we began to pour
from it into smaller ladles, each one of which held enough for
one wheel; if it was an ordinary size wheel it held enough for
one wheel, and if the wheels were smaller ones it held enough
for two or three. As that drew the molten iron from the
ladle and the iron continued to melt, the ladle was constantly
being filled from the cupolas, and it was kept full until all the
iron charged in the three cupolas was melted and the bottoms
dropped. Then the iron was continued to be poured out of the
large ladle until it was all used, these two methods making the
uniform mixture; that is, we mixed it in a solid state, first by
our charges and then in the molten state in the large ladle."
"As the mixture (of selected iron) was charged into each
cupola, as I have stated, it was made up of irons from various
furnaces, some iron having one quality and some another. As
it is melted in each cupola, it did not all melt at the same time,
and if we had drawn it directly from the cupola into the small
ladles from which we poured the wheels, one wheel might have
been poured out of very hard iron, another wheel out of very
soft iron, and so every shade between. There would have been
no uniformity in our work. But by taking it from the three
cupolas, all melting the same charges of iron, and collecting
them in a molten state, the inequalities of melting were all overcome and a uniform product produced."

Metals, 1875, thus described a foundry practice (italics not in

"In melting iron I should recommend melting it hot, and as
fast as possible. A quantity of molten iron should be kept in
the cupola or in a large ladle, so as to give the different brands
of iron a chance to mix. In most all the foundries at Wheeling,

West Virginia, the cupolas are never stopped in from the time
the blast is put on until the bottom is dropped. A large ladle
is set on trestles in front of the cupola, in such a manner that
the iron can run into it from the cupola and be poured out into
the smaller ladles at the same time. The iron is all run out of
the cupola as fast as it is melted, and is mixed in a large ladle.
I think this is a good way of mixing irons. See alloys."
3. The Altoona Practice: At the Altoona wheel works of the
Pennsylvania Railroad, from 1871, the cupola metal was designedly stored and mixed. The early reservoir ladle, of seven
tons capacity, received the metal from two cupolas, and was
thus described:
"A. The ladle turns on two trunnions and has chains leading
from these trunnions down to the hydraulic cylinder shown on
the drawing, one chain being wound in one direction on one
trunnion and other being wound in the other direction on the
other trunnion, and the two chains being connected at opposite
ends of the piston rod."
In describing the regular way of working each day the witness said (italics not in original):
"In the first place each cupola is charged with about forty
tons of metal. We charged about forty tons in each cupola;
then after we have this done we put the blast on and begin to
melt, and as soon as ever the bed in the cupola is filled up with
molten metal we tap it out into the receiving ladle or reservoir,
which fills the reservoir about one half full, then we stop the
cupolas up again until the iron raises to the eyeholes, then they
are tapped again, and this second tap generally fills the reservoir; then after the reservoir is full, we begin to pour the metal
out into smaller ladles, then send it around to the moulders for
pouring into the wheel moulds."
"The customr was to empty the receiving ladle about one half;
then hold the remainder of iron in the reservoir until the cdlo-

las were ready to be tapped again; and after the reservoiris full
we start and pour out into the smaller ladles again. The reeeiving ladle at all times is kept about one halfull,and it is this
full when we tap the metal into it from the cupola."

In the London Engineering for 1877, describing the practice
pursued at Altoona, when a ten-ton receiving ladle was used, it
was said: "It was found advisable to employ a ladle of so large
a capacity, because by doing so a more comnplete mixture of the
different iransis effected than would be the case if a smaller ves-

sel were employed."
And the methods of using cupola metal for foundry purposes
above described were early applied to making Bessemer steel
by the indirect process. The following excerpt from the testimony of a witness clearly states the subject:
"A. L. Holley, who built the Troy works, and made his first
conversion in 1865, introduced into this original plant tipping
accumulating ladle resting on scales. This ladle was patented
by Bessemer in 1869, English patent 566, alluded to in the previous answer, but apparently was an American invention. It
was introduced in some form or other in all the American works,
and was used almost always in duplicate, holding about two
heats each, or many cupola tappings. In the last works built
in St. Louis by Iolley, in 1876, there were three of these ladles.
In all American works these ladles were turning or tipping ladles, and were placed on scales to weigh the converter charges."
In 1877, describing the Vulcan works, a plant designed and
erected under Mr. Holley's supervision, that gentleman said
(London Engineering, vol. 23, 1877):
"The cupola ladles ff facilitate the distribution of metal to
the vessels. They form reservoirs which make the smelting department and the converting department independent of each
other, within limits. This advantagewas not appreciatedfully
until the large productions of the last few years were attempted.

Should any delay occur in casting, in preparing a vessel, or
from any cause, the melting department keeps right on, for
those three ladles will hold six vessel charges, which may be
stored and converted when the converting department is ready
for them. Cast iron will 'live' in these thildy lined ladles,

when covered with charcoal, for several hours. But it is necessary to put these ladles upon weighing machines, so that either
uniform vessel charges may be run out, or so that spoiegel charges
may be proportionedto such charges as are run out."
These ladles were variously named. Holley called them cupola ladles, interposed ladles and reservoirs. Hunt described
ladles."
them as "intermediate accumulating
A witness thus testified respecting the extent of use in this
country of the receiving ladle, as follows:
"Early American steel works, commencing with Troy in
1864, Pennsylvania in 1867, Cleveland in 1868, Cambria and
Union in1871, North Chicago in 1872, Joliet and Bethlehem in
in
1873, Edgar Thomson and Lackawanna in 1875 and Vulcan
two
about
1876, used receiving ladles, two in number, holding
heats each, with the exception of Bethlehem, which used a
single ladle on a car to mix taps from four cupolas, and Vulcan,
which used three receiving ladles, holding two heats each.
These ladles were used for storing and measuring the heats."
It is shown that from 1879 to 1888 the capacity of the accumulating ladle used at the works of the defendant was 28,000
pounds, and the converter charge 15,500 pounds, leaving 12,500
pounds in the ladle after a charge was supplied to the converter.
The cupola taps of from 4000 to 6000 pounds passed into and
filled such ladle.
Describing the mode of use of the ladle, Price, a witness,
said:
"It was the custom to leave in the ladle an amount of metal
equal to the difference between the converter charge and the
full ladle capacity. . . . This ladle was again filled to its
full capacity by retapping the cupolas.
"The metal from the several cupolas necessarily varied from
time to time considerably, both in chemical and physical conditions; at times the metal being such from one or two of the
cupolas that in themselves they would be unfit for converter
use. But by the means which was afforded by the intermediate
ladle, the metal from this one, or the two, cupolas, would be
averaged with the better adapted metal for converting from the
others."

the accumulating ladle at the works of the defendant, another
witness (Cabot) said:
"The mixing of cupola metal at Cambria was accomplished by
the tapping of a number of cupola furnaces into one large receiving ladle, from which converter charges were poured off,
and the supply in this ladle again increased by further tapping.
The practice at the ]3ellaire steel works was similar to that.
The purpose was to obtain a supply of metal for the converters
to equalize the different streams of metal from the different
cupolas, and that was its effect. It accomplished that."
Yet another witness (Iunt) declared "it was recognized as
one of the great features of the intermediate ladle, that it made
the work so much more uniform in results from mixture or
evening up of the various grades of pig iron used."
What distinction can be drawn between these methods and
the patent as now construed? This court and the Circuit Court
did put aside the Whitney method on the ground that it provided for obtaining absolute uniformity of product, while the
Jones method was held to provide simply for avoidance of
abrupt variations. Whilst it is clear that a method which had
for its purpose merely the prevention of abrupt variations
would not necessarily include one for the obtaining of a uniform
product, how a method of reservoiring molten metal as such
metal is produced in the furnace and drawing it off from the
reservoir for use, which produced uniformity of product as the
result of the reservoiring, can be said not to have embraced
the prevention of abrupt variations, is to my mind absolutely
unthinkable, since the greater must necessarily include the
lesser. For, of course, as there cannot be abrupt variations in
the constituent elements of a molten metal which is uniform, it
must follow that a process of reservoiring which in the continuous operation of a plant will obtain a uniform metal must necessarily exclude abrupt variations in the quality of the metal.
The court now, in addition, disposes not only of the Whitney
practice but of the others to which reference has just been made,
by certain general considerations which it is held applies to
them all. These considerations are, first, an assertion that al-

though all such practices included reservoiring and the incidental mixing arising therefrom, none of them contemplated
mixing as a necessary and inherent attribute, and none of them
embraced the retention in the reservoir of a considerable mass
of metal, a dominant pool, as a part of the process of reservoiring; and, second, as the practices in question related to molten
metal drawn from cupolas, therefore they did not establish
that reservoiring and mixing were known to the art so far as
concerns the molten metal drawn directly from blast furnaces.
The first proposition, it is submitted, is absolutely in conflict
with the express and uncontroverted proof in the record, as
manifested by the references which I have already made. Let
me recur to the practices under consideration to show that this
is the case. Take the Whitney practice as testified to by Whitney. After saying that withdrawals were not made from the
reservoir until "it was nearly full," and describing the drawing
off of the molten metal from the reservoir, he said:
"And (as) the iron continued to melt (in the cupolas) the ladle was constantly being filled from the cupolas, and it was
kept full until all the iron charged in the three cupolas was
melted and the bottoms dropped."
The witness thus clearly showed not only the constant retention of molten metal in the reservoir, bat that such retention
was recognized in the practice as essential to secure "desired
uniformity of molten metal." I cannot see how there can be
doubt on this subject, in view of the fact that the witness added:
"If we had drawn it (the molten metal) directly from the
cupola into the smaller ladles from which we pour the wheels,
one wheel might have been poured out of very hard iron, and
another wheel out of very soft iron, and so every shade between. There would have been no uniformity in our work.
But by taking it from the three cupolas, all melting the same
charges of iron, and collecting them in a molten state, the inequalities of melting were all overcome and a uniform product produced."
Take the wheel foundry practice as portrayed in Kirk's publication. The statement is made that "A quantity of molten
iron should be kept in the cupola, or in a large- ladle, so as to

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
WmTE,J., FULLER, 0. J., HARLAN and BREwER, JJ., dissenting.

give the different brands of iron a chance to mix." Again:
"The iron is all run out of the cupola as fast as it is melted,
and is mixed in a large ladle." The publication thus clearly
pointed out the advisability of retaining a residuum in the cupola
or in the reservoir, for the purpose of better mixing.
Recurring to the Altoona practice, doubt on the subject seems
to me to be in reason impossible. It is not gainsaid that such
practice embraced reservoiring and mixing. It cannot, it is
submitted, be affirmed that it did not embrace the retaining in
the reservoir of a large residuum of metal for the express and
necessary purpose of making the mixing more perfect, if the
proof as to the practice pursued is not wholly disregarded.
What was that practice? When the metal in the cupolas began
to melt, it was drawn off into the reservoir until the reservoir
was half full; then the withdrawals from the cupolas were
stopped. But the metal in the half full reservoir was not, however, then made use of. Why was it not so used, although
ready in the reservoir? The answer is, because it was deemed
best, in order to obtain beneficial results from mixing, to hold
the half full reservoir for a subsequent tapping therein from the
furnace, of a quantity of molten metal sufficient to fill the reservoir. Only when the reservoir was thus filled did they coinmence to draw the metal therefrom, and when by such use the
quantity in the reservoir was reduced to about one half, then
the drawing off was stopped, so as to retain about the one half
until there was a further replenishing from the furnace, and
thus the operation continued. How, by a mere affirmation, it
can be held that the process which has just been described did
not contemplate the constant retention of a considerable residuum in the reservoir, is to my mind inexplicable. Let me quote
again from the record the uncontradicted testimony as to the
practice in question:
"The custom was to empty the receiving ladle about one half;
then hold the remainder of iron in the reservoir until the cupolas
were ready to be tapped again; and after the reservoir is full
we start and pour out into the smaller ladles again. The receiving ladle at all times is kept about one half full, and it is
this full when we tap the metal into it from the cupola."

WHITE, J., FULLER, C. J., HARLAN and BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

The irresistible conclusion thus arising from this proof is, it
seems to me, rendered if possible clearer, when it is recalled-that
as early as 1877 the London Engineering, in a reference to this
practice, declared :
"It was found advisable to employ a ladle of so large a capacity, because by doing so a more complete mixture of the different irons is effected than would be the case if a smaller vessel were employed."
And what has just been said applies equally to the practice
of making Bessemer steel from cupola furnaces. That the excerpts which I have given on this subject clearly show that mixing by the use of a residue was the result of the employment of
the accumulating ladle, and a result that was well known and
intended, it seems to me cannot be gainsaid. Hlow the Jones
method, as construed, can be declared to have been novel-because in cupola metal there was no variation requiring mixing
-in face of the fact that the very patent which is sustained, in
various forms of expression, expressly declares that such variation exists, is not by me comprehended.
Besides, the proposition involves an unsound deduction, since
it in effect not only disregards the fact that the practices in
question were availed of with the avowed purpose of correcting
the inequalities found to exist in cupola metal, but also the erroneous assumption that there could be patentable novelty in
merely applying to blast furnaces the well known practices as
to cupola metal.
It may well be conceded, without affecting the case, that the
variation is greater in metal drawn from blast furnaces than in
that drawn from cupolas, but this mere difference in the degree
of variations between the two affords no ground for construing
the Jones patent in such a way as to cause it to cover the wellknown prior methods.
Nor does the example given in the opinion of the court for
the purpose of illustrating the difference which is found to exist
between the practices to which I have referred, and the Jones
patent, as now construed, enable my mind to discover the diference. The court says (italics mine):
"Let us imagine a reservoir containing, say, three quarts, and
VOL. cLxxxv-30

filled with one quart each, of three liquids of different constituent parts, and withdrawn for further treatment at the rate of
one or two quarts at a time. Necessarily there would be some
incidental mixing, but it would occur at once that the main object of the reservoir was a retention of a sufficient quantity of
the mixture to supply the receptacle for further treatment, and
if no necessity existed for a longer retention of the liquid in the
reservoir, it could be very quickly emptied by two discharges
into the receiving vessel. Now, let us substitute for this reservoir a cask of, say, sixty quarts, into which the liquids of different constituent parts are poured in at one end from a multitude of receptacles, and discharged at the other end after
remaining a certain time in the cask, and that this cask could
not be tilted so far but what a quantity of liquid would be left
within it amounting, say, to half its capacity. Now, if there
be no distinction between these two operations there would be
little left to the Jones process, the very vitality of which consists
in the size of the cask relative to the ladles and the mixing of the
various liquids poured into it before they are withdrawn."
In the first place, this example fails to notice the fact that in
the accumulating ladle the metal was received from several-in
some instances as many as four or five cupolas-and that in
practice a residue was constantly maintained, and for the purpose of mixing, and that these ladles could not be drained of
metal unless there was an intention to do so. The only distinction afforded by the example is that resulting from the difference
in sizes of the two supposed receptacles in which the mixing was
accomplished. But this would reduce the patentable novelty
in the Jones process to the size of the reservoir. Indeed, it is
so expressly stated, since in the opinion it is declared that "there
would be little left of the Jones process, the very vitality of
which consists in the size of the cask relative to the ladles and
the mixing of the various liquids passed into it before they are
withdrawn." The mixing having been disposed of by what I
have already said, it follows that the "very vitality" of the patent is found to be the size of the cask relative to the ladles,
which in reason is a direct abandonment of the whole theory of
a dominant pool previously expounded as the source of vitality

in the patent. But the size of the reservoir-called by the
court a cask-relative to the capacity of the plant, is clearly
shown not to have been novel, by what has been previously said,
and will be further demonstrated beyond peradventure by the
consideration which it is now proposed to give toThe _Manufacture of Bessemer Steel by the Direct Process.
The use of the direct process for Bessemerizing, it would
seem, was at once resorted to on the continent of Europe, and
there is testimony in the record giving rise to the inference
that the greater uniformity of the ores used in the blast furnaces on the continent caused such processes to be there at
once quite successful. However, it may not be doubted that
on the continent the use of a reservoir or accumulating ladle
sometimes obtained, and the advantages which it afforded of
bringing about a desirable mixture of the metals from several
furnaces was known. Thus Kohn, in the Journal of the Iron
and Steel Institute, 181, speaking of the practice at TerreNoire, in France, said:
"The iron is first run into a ladle, as explained by Mr. Menelaus, and so taken to the converter. The ladle is brought to
the back of one furnace, and half filled; it is then run to the
next furnace and filled up. In this way the Terre-Noire Company always obtain a mixture of the metals, and therefore the
greatest regularity is secured through the rest of the work.
The furnaces are kept in regular working order, and by carefully managing the charges of the blast furnaces, and watching
them as much as possible, the practical result is that there is
no inconvenience as regards the furnaces themselves in tapping frequently. The same thing is done at Mr. Schneider's
place at Creuzot, but he believed they do not there go so far as
to mix the iron."
In England, the direct process was not made use of until
about 1877, and it is shown that this largely resulted from the
fact that the Bessemer plants in the early use of the process
were not connected with blast furnaces.
In this country, though the manufacture of Bessemer steel
was commenced in the early sixties, and in one or two of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.

early experimental plants a brief use was made of direct metal,
the indirect process was in general use until the year 1882,
when the first large plant equipped for direct use of blast furnace metal began operations at the new South Chicago works
of the Illinois Steel Company, and later in the same year the
Edgar Thomson works (the Carnegie Company), with five new
furnaces, also commenced such work. These plants were still
producing steel by the direct process, with the use of the accumulating ladle when the Jones patent was granted in 1889,
and it was not until the year 1899 that a large 9torage tank
was installed at the South Chicago works.
A number of patents having relation to the making of steel
by the Bessemer direct process were from time to time granted
before the Jones patent was issued, and I shall now notice the
most important of such inventions, as also some other publications embodied in the literature of the art.
In the British patent to Deighton of 1873, the purpose of
the inventor, among others, was declared in the specifications
to be to keep a steel works plant or apparatus in nearly uninterrupted work, thus very considerably increasing the production of such plant. It was said:
"Instead of manufacturing Bessemer iron or steel from pig
iron which has to be melted in cupolas, my invention also consists in taking the molten metal directly from the blast furnace
to the converter, in which case I prefer to arrange the Bessemer plant in a.line at a right angle to a row of two or more
blast furnaces, and place a vessel to receive the molten metal
tapped from two or more blast furnaces to get a better average
of metal wich will be more suitable for makiing Bessemer steel
or metal qf -uniformquality, the vessel or receiver being placed
on a weighing machine so that any required weight may be
drawn or tapped from it and charged into the converter."
The apparatus was then described in detail, and consisted of
blast furnaces, arranged in a line, with channels from each furnace to a common reservoir or mixer, and with a connection
from the mixer to a converter, so that the molten metal in
running from the blast furnaces might go into the reservoir
and be mixed, and might be drawn off as desired to the con-

verter. It was stated that the receiving vessel "is placed low
enough to give fall for the molten metal to flow from the blast
furnaces to this receiver m, which forms a receptacle for mixing the molten metal from two or more of the smelting furnaces. From the receiver m the mixed molten metal is tapped
and flows down the swivel through nvinto the converter a. By
placing the vessel in on a weighing machine it can be readily
ascertained when the exact quantity required has been tapped
from it into the converter."
In 1885, a few years prior to the grant of the Jones patent,
two United States patents were issued to James P. Witherow,
1, For Apparatus for the Manufacture of Iron and Steel; and, 2,
Steel Plant Appliance, which patent showed a blast furnace, an
intermediate storage vessel of large size and a converter. In
brief, the purpose of the Witherow reservoir apparatus was to
receive and store the molten metal for the purpose of preventing the detention incident to the necessity of discharging the
contents of the blast furnaces when there is no converter ready
to receive it. The advantages of the large storage receptacle
was thus stated in the specification of one of the patents:
"' The metal is usually tapped from a blast furnace once in
every six hours, and the quantity thus cast is many times in
excess of the charge of a converter. . . . The charge of a
converter is from one to five tons, and in the case of a blast

The evidence establishes that the Deighton and Witherow
reservoirs were, each, of a capacity of one hundred tons.
Commenting, in June, 1877, upon the merits and demerits of
the use, then just commenced in England, of direct metal-that
is, the conversion of molten metal direct from the blast furnace,
without remelting in a cupola or storing it in a large reservoir
-A. L. Holley said (italics mine):
"It has not yet been practicable to work the blast furnace
with sufficient regularity to realize approximately the theoretical advantages of the direct process.

"Fourth. The obvious remedy is to mix a number of blastfurnace charges, so as to reduce the irregularity to a minimum.
Two systems of doing this are on the eve of trial: the one is
simply mixing so few charges in a tank that the metal will be
drawn out before it chills; the other is to store a larger number
of charges in a heated tank--that is to say, in an immense openhearth furnace."
The first of these two systems of mixing would seem to be
that embodied in the following portion of Mr. Holley's description of the West Cumberland practice:
"In order to get a more uniform metal, -[r. Snelus is about
trying the experiment of placing a 20-ton ladle on a hydraulic
lift at the IA' pit, so arranged as to store, mix and pour, say,
three 6-ton to T-ton blast-furnace taps, or to mix blast furnace
and cupola metal. No doubt this body of metal will 'live' if
the ladle is thickly lined and well covered. Mr. Snelus has
another object also; tapping half or a third of a vessel heat out
of the blast furnace-in other words, tapping so often-wears
out the tap-hole more rapidly; slag gets into the walls and weakens them. It is preferable in every way, as blast furnace men
well understand, to tap a full hearth. At the same time improvements in working the furnace are gradually developing.
Afore care is taken as to the selection of ores, the size of ore and
limestone, the distribution of materials in the furnace, the temperature of the blast, and all elements of uniformity.
uniform results in the Bessemer department can
hardly be expected, unless a number of blast-furnace charges
are mixed. This would seem to be the theoretical solution of
the problem."
The second of the two systems of mixing is undoubtedly the
one then being erected at Mfoss Bay, England, viz., a 60-ton
reverberatory coal-fired furnace or two 40-ton furnaces. The
ladles of blast furnace metal were to be "tapped out into the
large reverberatory furnace," in which "it is the intention to
store and keep hot some sixty tons of iron from all the blast
furnaces." This method, for some reason not stated, perhaps
an economical one, was not successful. 11r. Holley, in the article
just noticed, referring to the arrangements in connection with

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

C.J.,

HARLAN and BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

the use of this "large furnace," said: "The complex manipulations due to the arrangement described seem likely to take unnecessary amount of time and labor."
After reviewing the practice in the various English and continental steel works using direct metal, Mr. Holley summed up
his conclusions, and recommended the American works to continue for the present to select and remelt the pig metal, and
confine their efforts for some time "to the preliminary department of the direct process-to increasingour uniformity of blastfurnaceworking and product." We excerpt the following pas-

sages from the conclusions contained in the report:
"Fourth. But if the storage of a large quantity of iron in a
reverberatory furnace or other reservoir should prove successful,
then a few blast furnaces making even an irregular product, and,
if necessary, working in connection with cupolas, would largely
economize the Bessemer manufacture.
"In fact, this mixing of irregular irons on a very large scale,
thus avoiding the expensive niceties of ore selection and the
necessity of many furnaces, is the theoretical key to the situation. When the way to its successful adoption is demonstrated
the direct process will undoubtedly have great advantages, even
over the present practice on the continent, which employs manganiferous ores. But until this large-scale mixing is developed
it should not appear that the use of our comparatively irregular
blast-furnace and part cupola metal can result in any substantial saving.
"But the mixing problem is not such a difficult one. A small
amount of flame spread over a large surface of metal should
certainly keep it hot for a long time, seeing that the metal will
keep hot in a ladle exposed to air for an hour or more. And
should there be any trouble about stopping the tap-hole in a
large storing furnace, it would not be a very difficult or expensive matter (considering the Pernot revolving hearth experience)
to tip the whole hearth to pour a charge."
Without stopping to comment in detail upon all the matters
just referred to, there can be no question that they demonstrate
that if the vitality of the Jones patent depends upon the size of
the reservoir, it was clearly anticipated. They also further

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.

establish that the advisability of the use of a large reservoir for
the purposes of storage and mixing was well known, and that
it was deemed to be an obvious and desirable expedient is also
apparent.
It is not denied that the Deighton and Witherow patents each
provided for a reservoir, the former (Deighton) laying stress
upon the advantages resulting from the mixing in such reservoir.
Both patents, it seems to me, in effect contemplating as they
did the continuous operation of the plant and in view of the
relative capacities of the furnace or furnaces, the reservoir, and
the converters, necessarily embrace the presence in the reservoir
of a considerable residuum, without which residue the proposed
continuity was impossible. As it is to me apparent, I do not
stop to refer to the testimony showing that this must necessarily be the case. The argument that the Deighton reservoir
had no cover, and therefore it is not the Jones process, ignores
the fact that Jones in his process patent does not provide for
the operation of his method in a covered receptacle, but, on the
contrary, in the specifications of that patent, it is declared that
the process may be carried on in a charging ladle, an uncovered
receptacle. Further, it is to be borne in mind that the record
overwhelmingly establishes that it was a well known expedient
to cover a ladle or other receptacle for molten metal when the
metal was required to be retained longer than the customary
time. The inappositeness of the suggestion that the Deighton
patent ought not to be given any weight as showing the state
of the art, because the pAtentee allowed the patent to lapse for
the non-payment of fees, cannot be better illustrated than by
this case, when it is recalled that the patent to Mushet, which
made Bessemerizing commercially practicable, was allowed to
lapse because the Patent Office fees were not paid.
The demonstration of want of novelty in the patent as construed which arises from the previous considerations entirely
disposes of the case, as it is, as already observed, conceded that
unless the patent means what it is now held to mean, there was
no infringement by the defendant. It is to me equally clear,
however, that even if the state of the art be, arguendo, put out
of view, the patent cannot be held to signify what it is now de-

cided to mean, a, without repudiating the true meaning of the
patent, which is properly deducible from the proceedings in the
Patent Office, that is, the file-wrapper and contents, and without refusing to give effect to the express declarations and admissions of the patentee (Jones) as to the significance of the patent,
which is also shown by the proceedings in question; and, b,
without misconceiving and misconstruing the patent. Let me
briefly demonstrate these propositions.
As I have said at the outset, the application for the patent in
suit when first made was rejected by the Patent Office, on the
ground of the prior state of the art, as evidenced by the Witherow patents and the Kirk publication. An amended application was thereupon filed, which beyond all question eliminated
from the patent all claim to an exclusive right to reservoir or
store the molten metal. When this amendment was presented
to the .Patent Office, counsel for the applicant submitted a
written argument to demonstrate the patentability of the
method covered by the amended application, in which no reference whatever was made to the importance of a residue, whether
of small or considerable size, but the purpose of the inventor
was thus declared (italics mine): "To have a receptacle capable
of holding metal in a molten condition, into which metal, it may
be, from several blast furnaces, is run from time to time and
from which metal is drawn for treatment in the converters, or
otherwise, as required. This continuous pouring into and drawing out of a common receptacle produces such a mixture of the
charges as results in an uniform average quality of metal,
whether treated in the converters or used for casting iwithout
such t1reatment, as is very desirable, but has hitherto been found
unattainable." But the amended application was rejected, and
the examiner-evidently having in mind the statement in the
argument of counsel above referred to-called the attention of
the applicant to the fact that the continual pouring into and
drawing out of the molten metal to produce a mixture was anticipated by the Kirk publication. The examiner said. (italics
mine):
"The process, as now claimed, seems to be fully met by the
description in Kirk's metal founding, heretofore referred to,

OCTOBER TERAT, 1901.
WnxTE, J., FuLLER, 0. J., HARLAN and BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

which states that the metal is run continuouslyfrom the cupola
and mixed in the ladle, from which it is tapped into the smaller
ladle. See also the additional references of British patents,
No. 859, Broman, March 23, 1866, page 5, lines 25-35, and
No. 2382, Stewart, May 10, 1883, page 5, lines 9 and 10."
When it is borne in mind that the Kirk publication thus referred to provides expressly for a continuous inflowing and outdrawing of the metal, and besides expressly said, "A quantity
of molten metal should be kept . . . so as to give the different
brands of iron a chance to mix," the conclusion cannot by me
be escaped that the examiner pointed out to Jones that the conception of a continuous inflow and outflow, and the keeping of
a residue for the pnrpose of mixing, was not patentable.
The presumption cannot be indulged in that the amendment
was not intended to obviate the objection on account of which
the Patent Office had rejected the application, and, moreover,
it cannot be assumed that the Patent Office issued the patent
for a method which it declared was not patentable. But now
the patent is construed by the court as covering the continuous
flowing into and withdrawal from a reservoir of molten metal,
and as alone referring to the prevention of abrupt variations in
the metal drawn from the reservoir for use in a converter, whilst
Jones himself declared to the Patent Office that the patent as
amended related to metal drawn (from a reservoir) for treatment in a converter or otherwise, as required. Besides it was
expressly stated that what the patent contemplated was the
production of a uniform quality of metal, intended for further
treatment in the converters or to be used for casting without
such treatment. It is submitted that this demonstrates that
the construction now given by the court to the patent is directly
repugnant to the meaning which Jones affixed to it, and besides
is in conflict with the ruling of the Patent Office, in which
Jones acquiesced, and upon which the patent was issued; and,
therefore, that the construction which the patent now receives
amounts, it seems to me, to a grant by judicial decision of a
new and different patent from that which the Patent Office
allowed.
Conclusive as is the view just stated, it is made, if possible,

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

and BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

more so if the correct construction of the patent be ascertained.
This it is proposed to demonstrate by an analysis of the patent
as originally applied for, by a consideration of the amendments
made to it, and by its text in its final form. Considering these
matters, it will, I think, appear that the patent was not, as now
held to be, solely one for the prevention of abrupt variations in
the metal drawn from the receptacle for use in a converter.
On the contrary, the true purport of the patent was this and
this only: The selection of separate portions of molten metal,
pouring the same into a reservoir, mixing such aggregated portions of molten metal thoroughly until it, the commingled metal,
became uniform, so that the equalized metal might be used, not
alone in the making of steel in a converter, but in any other
process of making steel, in a foundry, or in any other mode
where a uniform product was desired. Having thus provided
for equalizing the contents of the reservoir when filled with
selected metal and mixing had been accomplished, the patent
contemplated that this equalized molten metal present in the
reservoir should be drawn off for any desirable purpose down
to an undetermined residue, so that when a fresh supply of selected metal was charged into the reservoir the metal thus
newly supplied might be mixed with the residuum and thus not
only a further sup'Ply of equalized metal might be obtained,
but also, as a result, abrupt variations between the freshly equalized metal and that of the preceding batch discharged from the
reservoir, would be avoided.
To demonstrate the correctness of this construction, which,
as already shown, was undoubtedly the view taken by the Patent Office, let me come to consider the application for the patent,
the amendments and the patent as granted.
The application, as originally filed, contained a statement of
the _rimary object of the invention, which is excerpted in the
margin.'
1 " The primary object of the invention is to provide means for insuring
uniformity in the product of a Bessemer steel works or similar plant, in
which the metal from more than one (subsequently amended to read ' one
or more') blast furnaces is employed to charge the converters. The product
of the different furnaces, or of the same furnace at different times, varies

This was followed by a statement of the secondary objects
designed to be attained, as follows:
"My invention, however, is not limited to its use in connection with converters, since similar advantages may be obtained
by casting the metal from the mixing vessel into pigs for use
in converters, puddling furnaces or for any other uses to which
pig iron may be put in the art."
A description was then given of the apparatus, which it was
previously stated had been invented "for practicing my invention," and the mode of operation of such apparatus was stated.
The claim read as follows:
"The process hereinbefore described, which consists in storing charges of molten metal in a covered receptacle provided
with a heat-retaining lining, removing portions only of the
molten contents of the said receptacle without entirely draining or emptying the same, and successively replenishing the receptacle with fresh additions of molten metal, whereby the
character of the several charges of metal so treated is equalized ; substantially as described."
Considering the application as thus made, what support does
it lend to the theory now announced that it was the purpose of
in quality, the variation depending on the kind of ore employed, and on
many other conditions well known to those skilled in the art, so that when
the converters are charged at one time with the output from one furnace,
and at another time with the output from another furnace or furnaces, the
manufactured steel lacks uniformity in grade. To avoid this I employ
suitably constructed reservoirs or vessels, into which the molten metal from

the blast furnaces is put, the vessels being of proper capacity to hold a considerable charge of metal from a single furnace, or from a number of furnaces, and being adapted to retain the metal in amolten state for sufficient
time to enable the different charges to mix and become homogeneous. The
advantage which I thus obtain in securing uniformity and homogeneity in

the total product will be readily understood by those familiar with the
operations of a steel works and the frequent loss which is caused by the lack

of such uniformity.

Such apparatus possesses also an additional advantage

in that it makes it possible to dispense with cupola furnaces for remelting
the pigs preparatory to charging the converters. The metal maybe tapped
from the blast furnaces into ladles or trucks, carried to and discharged into
the mixing reservoir or vessel, and there retained in a molten state until
sufficient metal has been accumulated to charge the converters."

the Jones invention merely to prevent abrupt variations between each charge of metal drawn from a reservoir for treatment in a converter? Such purpose is nowhere declared, unless it be inferred from certain statements in the patent descriptive of the mode of operation of the appliance covered by the
apparatus patent, to which, hereafter, I shall more particularly
advert. The conception that the patent solely related to abrupt
variations in metal drawn from a reservoir and supplied to a
converter, is absolutely excluded by the fact that the secondary
object is pointed out to be to secure a pig metal so uniform in
its chemical constituents that it might be used "in puddling
furnaces or for any other use to which pig iron might be put in
the art." It cannot be conceived that the patent provided for
making the metal uniform in the reservoir, and, by the same
language, provided merely against the occurrence of abrupt
variations in the equalized metal when drawn off to a converter.
If made uniform, there could not, in the nature of things, be
abrupt variations. It being then certain that the process-patent, as originally filed, in and of itself not only contained even
no intimation of the claim which the court now attributes to
the patent, it must follow that if the patent covered such a
claim, it was one not in the mind of Jones, but must have been
in some way evolved in the passage of the application through
the Patent Office.
This original application, as I have said, was rejected by the
Patent Office, as being "completely anticipated" by the Witherow patents, and reference was made to the Kirk publication.
To meet this objection a change was made by which the assertion of an exclusive right to store charges of molten metal
was eliminated, the amendment being as follows:
"The process hereinbefore described, which consists in running successive charges of molten metal into a covered receptacle provided with a heat-retaining lining, removing from time
to time from said receptacle for subsequent treatment a portion
only of its molten contents, and successively replenishing such
receptacle with fresh additions of molten metal, for the purpose of equalizing the character of the several charges of metal
drawn therefrom, substantially as described."

Accompanying this paper was the argument of the attorney,
already referred to, in which it was expressly declared, as has
been seen, that the patent related to uniformity of molten metal
for further treatment in converters, or otherwise; that is, as
declared in the argument, the obtaining of a metal of such
uniform quality that it might not alone be used in converters,
but might be "used for casting without such treatment."
As the application, as amended, was asserted to embody a
claim for the continuous operation of a plant by reservoiring
metal, by inflowing and outflowing, with mixing, a method
construed by the Patent Office as identical with that described
in the Kirk publication, the patent, as already stated, was again
rejected. It was again amended, and, as thus finally amended,
the patent was allowed. The new amendments consisted, first,
of a substituted statement of the primary object of the invention, which is excerpted in the margin.' It will be observed,
1 " The primary object of my invention is to provide means for rendering
the product of steel works uniform in chemical composition. In practice
it is found that metal tapped from different blast furnaces is apt to vary
considerably in chemical composition, particularly in silicon and sulphur,
and such lack of uniformity is observable in different portions of the same
cast, and even in different portions of the same pig." [Here follows table
of analyses said to have been made of metal contained in different ladle
charges from one cast of a blast furnace.] . . . "The consequence of
this tendency of the silicon and sulphur to segregate or form pockets in
the crude metal is that the product of the refining process in the converters
or otherwise in like manner lacks uniformity in these elements, and therefore often causes great inconvenience and loss, making it impossible to
manufacture all the articles of a single order of homogeneous composition. Especially is this so in the process of refining crude iron taken from
the smelting furnace and charged directly into the converter without remelting in a cupola, and, although such direct process possesses many
economic advantages, it has on this account been little practised.
"For the purpose of avoidingthe practical evils above stated, I use in the
refining process a charge composed not merely of metal taken at one time
from the smelting furnace, but of a number of parts taken from different
smelting furnaces, or from the same furnace at different casts, or at different
periods of the same cast, and subject the metal before its final refining to a
process of mixing, whereby its particles are diffused or mingled thoroughly
among each other, and the entire charge is practically homogeneous in
composition, representing in each part the average of the unequally diffused
and segregated elements of silicon and sulphur originally contained in each

from the concluding sentence in the first paragraph, that it
was clearly implied that the applicant deemed that inequalities were present in cupola metal as well as in blast furnace
metal.
There was substituted for the single claim as originally presented and amended the two claims embodied in the patent as
finally issued, and which have been previously set out.
It plainly results from the amendment that it was drawn to
meet the objection of the examiner and to make clear the fact
that the character of the mixing contemplated by the Jones
process was not that resulting from a continuous operation of a
reservoir by the inflowing and outdrawing of metal with the
constant retention of a residuum, but was a distinct character
of mixing by thorough commingling of batches of metal, in
order to produce in a reservoir a molten metal which would be
homogeneous and uniform, of a character deemed to be unattainable by the continuous process; the purpose of securing this
reservoir of uniform metal being to obtain a mixed metal so
uniform in its chemical constituents that it might be, with
greater advantage than theretofore, subjected to further treatment in the converters or be run into pigs, which, by reason of
the uniform quality of the metal, might then be used for any
purpose where such a metal was desired. In other words, the
amendment was drawn for the purpose of satisfying the Patent
of the several parts or charges. By proceeding in this way not only is each
charge for the refining furnace or converter homogeneous in itself, but, as
it represents an average of a variety of uniform constituent parts, all the
charges of the converter from time to time will be substantially uniform,
and the products of all will be homogeneous. To this end my invention
may be practiced with a variety of forms of apparatus-for example, by
merely receiving in a charging ladle a number of small portions of metal
taken from several ladles or receiving vessels containing crude metal obtained at different times or from different furnaces, the mixing being performed merely by the act of pouring into the charging ladle, and other like
means may be employed. I prefer, however, to employ the apparatus
shown in the accompanying drawings, and have made it the subject of a
separate patent application, serial No. 289,673, and, without intending to
limit the invention to the use of that specific apparatus, I shall describe it
particularly, so that others skilled in the art may intelligently employ the
same."

Office that the method which was claimed should not be rejected, because the prior art provided against mere variations in
the metal drawn from the reservoir, as the patent went further
and described a process of mixing which would bring about the
greater result of a uniform molten metal and consequent uniform product.
This conclusion is rendered clear by the fact that the amended
application not only retained in substance all the prior declarations as to the purpose of obtaining a uniform mixed molten
metal, and as to the use of such uniform metal, in converters or
otherwise, but emphasized the same by adding the following:
"To this end my invention may be practiced with a variety
of forms of apparatus. For example, by merely receiving in a
charging ladle a number of small portions of metal taken from
several ladles or receiving vessels containing crude metal obtained at different times or from different furnaces, the mixing
being performed merely by the act of pouring into the charging ladle, and other like means may be employed."
And to make the object of the amendment perfectly clear,
the prior description of the method was supplemented by stating that the "commingling of the contents may be aided by
agitation of the vessel on its trunnions, so as to cause the stirring or shaking of its liquid contents."
True it is that on the trial below the complainant presented
a disclaimer, which the court now upholds, by which he sought
to eliminate from the patent the amendments which had been
inserted to meet the objections of the Patent Office examiner,
and which indubitably fixes the meaning of the patent. I do
not deem it necessary, however, to stop to refer to authorities
to show that a disclaimer which, in effect, has for its object the
making of a new patent by striking out the essential representations upon which the patent was granted, is without legal
warrant. This, it is submitted, is the obvious result of the authorities to which the opinion of the court refers.
But even if the patent as it is now made over, as I think, by
the effect which is given by the court to the disclaimer, be
alone considered, it plainly results that the patent as so changed
did not contemplate, as now decided, solely the prevention of

abrupt variations in the metal drawn from the reservoir for use
in the converter, since the pateht yet provides "Instead of discharging the metal into the cars 12 and carrying it in the cars
to the converters or casting house, the vessel 2 may be so situate
relative to the other parts of a furnace plant as to deliver its
contents immediately to the converters or other place where it
is to be utilized." I fail to see how it can be held, even giving
the fullest effect to the disclaimer, that the patent provides only
for metal to be supplied to a converter, when it expressly points
out that the metal may be used "in the casting house, in the
converters or otherplace where it is to be utilized."
I come now to the statements found in the patent to which
I have previously alluded, which the court thinks give support
to the claim that the patent had reference merely to the avoidance of abrupt variations in metal supplied to the converters.
The statements thus relied upon are contained in that portion
of the patent where the mode of operation of the appliance
covered by the apparatus patent is described. These passages
are excerpted in the margin.'
When the passages in question are properly considered, it
becomes, I submit, incontrovertible that, instead of sustaining,
1 " Referring now to the drawings, 2 represents the reservoir before men-

tioned. It consists of a covered hollow vessel having an outer casing, 3, of
iron or steel, which is suitably braced and strengthened by interior beams
and tie-rods, as shown in the drawings. The whole exterior of the vessel
is lined with fire-brick or other refractory lining, which should be of sufficient thickness to retain the heat of the molten contents of the vessel and
to prevent chilling thereof. The vessel is strongly braced and supported
by braces and tie-rods, and may be of any convenient size, holding, say, one
hundred tons of metal, (more or less,) and its shape is preferably sucl as
shown in the drawings, being rectangular, or nearly so, in cross-section and
an irregular trapezium in longitudinal section, one end being considerably
deeper than the other. At the top of the deeper end, which I call the 'rear'
end, is a hopper, 5, into which the molten metal employed in charging the
vessel is poured, and at the front end is a discharge-spout, 6, which is so
located that the bottom of the spout is some distance above the bottom of
the vessel-say two feet in a hundred-ton tank, and more or less, according
to the capacity of the vessel-the purpose of which is that when the metal
is poured out of the spout a considerable quantity may always be left remaining and unpoured, and that whenever the vessel is replenished there
may already be contained in it a body of molten metal with which the fresh

they are antagonistic to the construction which has been given
by the court to the patent, and hence sustain the construction
which has been presented in this dissent.
Referring to the excerpted matter in the margin, it will be
addition may mix. I thus secure, as much as possible, uniformity in character of the metal which is fed to and dischargedfroin the tank, and cause the
fluctuations in quality of the successive tappings to be very gradual."
"The mode of operation of the apparatus is as follows: When the vessel
is in the backwardly-inclined position shown in Fig. 1, it is readyto receive
a charge of metal from the car 7. Before introducing the first charge, however, the mixing vessels should be heated by internal combustion of coke
or gas, and when the walls of the vessel are sufficiently hot to hold the
molten metal without chilling it it is charged repeatedly from the cars 7
with metal obtained either from a number of furnaces or at different times
from a single furnace. The chargesof metal introduced at different times
into the vessel, though differing in quality, mix together, and when the vessel
has received a sufficient charge its contents constitute a homogeneous molten
mass, whose quality may not be precisely the same as that of any one of its
constituent charges, but represents the average quality of all the charges. if
desired, the commingling of the contents may be aided by agitation of the
vessel on its trunnions, so as to cause the stirring or shaking of its liquid
contents. The mixing chamber being deeper at its rear than at the front
end, as before described, and its normal position when not discharging
metal for the purpose of casting being with the bottom inclined upward
toward the front or discharging end, and the bottom of the spout being situate above the bottom of the vessel at its forward end, it is adapted to receive and hold a large quantity of molten metal without its surface rising
high enough to enter the discharge spout."
" After the vessel is properly charged, the metal is drawn off into the
cars 15 from time to time, as it is needed, by opening the door or cover 16
of the spout 6 and driving the engine 12, so as to elevate the rear end of
the vessel and tilt it forward, and thus to discharge any required amount
of its contents in the manner before explained into the cars 15, which are
transported to the converters, or the metal is cast into pigs or otherwise
used. The tilting of the vessel does not, however, drain off all the contents thereof, a portion being prevented from escaping by reason of the
elevated position of the spout 6, and as the vessel is replenished from time
to time each new charge mixes with parts of previous charges remaining in
the vessel, by which means any sudden variationsin the quality of the metal
supplied to the converter is avoided. Instead of discharging the metal into
the cars 12 and carrying it in the cars to the converters or casting house,
the vessel 2 may be so situate relatively to the other parts of a furnaceplant as to deliver its contents immediately to the converters or other place
where it is to be utilized."

seen that in the second paragraph is described the mode of filling the reservoir. Various portions of metal, termed" charges,"
are drawn "either from a number of furnaces or at different
times from a single furnace," and such charges are introduced
into the reservoir until the vessel is full, that is, to use the language of the patent, until a "sufficient charge" has been supplied to the reservoir, the result being, as stated in the patent,
that the charges of metal thus accumulated in the reservoir
"constitute a homogeneous molten mass, whose quality may
not be precisely the same as that of any one of its constituent
charges, but represents the average quality of all of the charges."
Thus it appears that the patentee had in mind the cure of the
inequalities or variations present in the "charges" of metal
poured into the reservoir to make up the "sufficient charge,"
and thereby to cause such sufficient charge "to constitute a
homogeneous molten mass, whose quality may not be precisely
the samihe as that of any one of its constituent charges, but represents the average quality of all the charges." And the production of this homogeneous mass, it is further observed, "may
be aided by the agitation of the vessel on its trunnions, so as to
cause the stirring or shaking of its liquid contents." Manifestly,
not only the obtaining of the homogeneous molten mass is absolutely incompatible with the theory that the patent related
to mere variations, but the statement about the agitation of the
vessel on its trunnions is likewise a negation that the conception of the patent related to the continuous inflowing and outflowing of molten metal from the reservoir. The construction
now put upon the patent by the court disregards the provision
that the variation which was to be cured was that existing between the "charges" as they were poured in, and assumescontrary to the language of the patent-that the purpose was
to cure variations which would exist in the mass of molten metal,
when, by a sufficient charge, the reservoir had been filled. And
this, although it is expressly declared in the patent that by the
operation of the reservoir, in the mode described, the variations
existing in the metal before the pouring in would be destroyed
by the mixing, which would cause the mass from which withdrawals were to be made to become homogeneous.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
WHITE, J., FULLER, C. J., RIARLAN and BREWER, JJ., dissenting.

The error becomes more manifest upon an examination of
the last of the excerpted paragraphs, wherein is contained directions as to the withdrawals of the equalized metal from the
sufficient charge, that is, the filled reservoir of equalized metal
and the replenishing of the reservoir with new charges to make
another sufficient charge. It will be seen that the patent contemplated the discharge of the mass of homogeneous metal by
tilting the tank down to a residue, and that no reference is made
to replenishing the reservoir until provision is made for the retention of a residue. Then the reservoir is to be replenished
by the addition of new charges which mix with these parts of
previous charges, which have been equalized and which remain
in the reservoir as a residue. Obviously, in this subsequent addition of charges it was intended that a "sufficient charge" of
metal should be contained in the reservoir, which, when thoroughly mixed, would form another homogeneous mass of molten
metal, it being declared "by which means any sudden variations
in the quality of the metal supplied to the converter is avoided."
"By which means" is clearly meant the bringing into existence
of the homogeneous mass referred to in the patent. In other
words, the patent points out that by maling all the "constituent charges" of a "sufficient charge" homogeneous there would
be no variations in the withdrawals from that equalized mass.
And this is besides made more manifest by the following sentence in which attention is called to the fact that the equalized
metal thus drawn off might be carried to the converters or be
cast into pigs without treatment in the converters.
Moreover, turning to the first paragraph in the excerpt, it
will be perceived that it is stated that the operation of the mixer
as described will "secure, as much as possible, uniformity in the
character of the metal which is fed to and discharged from the
tank, (meaning the equalized mass,) and cause the fluctuations
in the quality of the successive tappings to be very gradual."
That is to say, the patent contemplated that each distinct full
reservoir or sufficient charge, constituting a batch of metal,
would be homogeneous in itself and substantially uniform in its
chemical constituents, and the sut.ceessive "1sufficient charges" or
"full reservoirs" would, by means of the residuum, vary but

CARNEGIE STEEL CO. v. CAMBRIA IRON CO.

slightly between each other. The words "successive tappings"
can have no other meaning than successive batches, for it is impossible to conceive that they could refer to the separate withdrawals of metal taken from one full reservoir or sufficient
charge, because it had been declared that the "constitutent
charges" of each full reservoir of metal by the operation described would become homogeneous; that is, practically uniform.
Certainly, this construction of the patent gives effect to all
of its provisions, and harmonizes with its plain letter, whilst the
contrary construction, now approved by the court, reads out of
the patent the repeated statements as to the purpose of the patent being to secure a uniform molten metal and disregards the
fact that the patent expressly provides that what it aims to secure is such uniform metal as is fit not only for use in converters
but for castings and any other mode by which such a metal can
be utilized. Certainly, what has been previously stated is a
demonstration that the construction previously given by me
accords with the express declaration made by the patentee when
he applied for his patent, and is strictly in harmony with the
action of the Patent Office in allowing the patent. It is equally
clear that the construction of the patent, which has been by me

elucidated, is besides in accord with the conception entertained
by the Patent Office of the meaning of the patent long after it
had been issued.

Thus, the Commissioner of Patents, in a re-

port bearing date January 1, 1896, reviewing the advance in
the industrial arts, said (italics mine):
"A process now commonly used in steel manufacture is that
of patent No. 404,114, January 4, 1889, to Jones, in which he
described a means of getting a uniform _product of metal by

mixing together in a suitable receptacle, batches of metal from
different furnaces, so that the mixture when drawn off will be
the average of the different charges."
As the views hereinbefore expressed sufficiently make manifest the reasons for my dissent, it is unnecessary to stop to notice many matters considered in the opinioni of the court. Lest,
however, if they are not referred to, it may be assumed that
assent is given to them, the more important of such statements

are briefly adverted to. First, it is said that the making of
steel by the direct process was commercially impracticable before the grant of the Jones patent, and that that patent operated
a revolution in the art. The proposition, in my opinion, finds
no support in the record. On the contrary, it is affirmatively
established that not only on the continent but in England and
in this country, long prior to the grant of the Jones patent,
Bessemer steel was made by the direct process, upon a large
scale, continuously and successfully. So far as revolution in the
art is concerned by the alleged enormous saving rendered possible by the use of the Jones method, it is not perceived how
such a statement is compatible with the unquestioned proof in
the record that, although the complainants at their Edgar Thomson works erected several of the Jones mixers about the time
of the grant of the Jones patent, they did not introduce them
into their other works until more than seven years afterwards.
Indeed, to my mind it is established by the record that the
Jones method, when put into practical operation by the complainant, proved not to be a commercial success, and the apparatus was continued in use despite this fact because of the means
which it afforded of securing on a larger scale the benefits of
storage hitherto well known in practice, and that the use of
this larger storage vessel became more and more advantageous
as the capacity of blast furnaces was enlarged and improvements took place in the mode of their operation.
The statement that upon the grant of the Jones patent the
so-called mixer was at once adopted by steel works generally in
this country is also unwarranted by the facts in evidence, which
establish without any conflict that storage reservoirs of like
capacity to that of the Jones apparatus were in use at the time
of the hearing of this cause in but three steel works in the
United States outside of those operated by the complainant, and
that their introduction long after the grant of the Jones patent
in such outside works is shown to have been coincident with
the increase in blast furnace output and the necessity which
had thus arisen for greater reservoir capacity to hold the enormous supply of molten metal which was then being produced
by the operation of blast furnaces. The record, moreover, es-

tablishes that in the works in question, where long after the
grant of the Jones patent large reservoirs were first employed,
this was done not because better results were secured by means
of mixing than had been obtained by the mixing theretofore
resorted to, but because the larger output of blast furnaces
pointed to the necessity for the construction of a larger reservoir than those previously employed.
The effect of the decision now rendered it seems to me is,
therefore, to put the patentee in a position where, without invention on his part, and without the possession by him of lawful letters patent, he is allowed to exact tribute from the steel
and iron-making industry, whenever those engaged in such industry desire to increase their plants or to more conveniently
and satisfactorily conduct their operations so as to keep pace
with the natural evolution of modern industrial development.

The court below erred in dismissing this action, for want of jurisdiction, as
the right which it was claimed had been unlawfully invaded, was one
arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States; and
although it has been held that, on error from a state court to this court,
where the Federal question asserted to be contained in the record, is manifestly lacking all color of merit, the writ of error should be dismissed,
that doctrine relates to questions arising on writs of error from state
courts, where, aside from the Federal status of the parties to the action,

or the inherent nature of the Federal right which is sought to be vindicated, jurisdiction is to be determined by ascertaining whether the record
raises a bona fide Federal question.
