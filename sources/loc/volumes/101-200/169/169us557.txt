BACKUS v. FORT STREET UNION DEPOT
COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN.
No. 55. Argued January 17, 18, 1S98. -Decided March 7, 1898.
As the respondents, both at the trial in the Circuit Court of the State, and
in the subsequent proceedings on the certiorari in the Supreme Court
of the State, specifically set up and claimed rights under the Federal
Constitution which were denied, the jurisdiction of this court is not
open to doubt.
While this court may examine proceedings had in a state court, under state
authority, for the appropriation of private property to public purposes,
so far as to ipiquire whether that court prescribed any rule of law in
disregard of the owner's right to just compensation, it may not inquire
into matters which do not necessarily involve, in any substantial sense,
the Federal right alleged to have been denied.
The settled rule of this court in cases for the determination of the amount
of damages to be paid for private property condemned and taken for
public use, is that it accepts the construction placed by the Supreme
Court of the State upon its own constitution and statutes.
In case of such condemnation and taking, a State may authorize possession
to be taken prior to the final determination of the amount of compensation, provided adequate provision for compensation is made.
As to the court to determine the question, or the form of procedure, all
that is essential is that, in some appropriate way, before some properly
constituted tribunal, inquiry shall be made as to the amount of compensation; and when this has been provided for there is that due process
of law which is required by the Federal Constitution.

OCTOBER TERM4, 1897.
Statement of the Case.
There is no vested right in a mode of procedure established by state law
for the condemnation of property for public use; but each succeeding
legislature may establish a different one, provided only that in each is
preserved the essential element of protection.
An appellate court is not required to set aside the judgment of the trial
court by reason of failure to give instructions which were not asked for.
The limit of interference by this court with the judgments of state courts
is reached when it appears that no fundamental rights have been disregarded by the state tribunals.
The Supreme Court of Michigan was called upon to consider only such
objections as had been particularly specified, and all others were deemed
to have been waived.
The decision by the Supreme Court that it had power to set aside the verdict and order a new trial was not a reversal of a ruling that the Circuit
Court had no such power.
This court is bound to accept the construction placed upon the state statute
by the Supreme Court of the State, and to hold that it means that if the
second appraisal was less than the first, and the amount of the first had
been paid, the company was entitled to recover the difference from.the
party to whom it had been paid.

Tim facts in this case are as follows: The defendant in error
is a corporation created under the laws of the State of Michigan, fof the purpose of constructing a union depot in the city
of Detroit. In order to connect this depot with the railroads
desiring to enter, it was necessary to place tracks on River
street, and some of the way, at least, these tracks bad to be
elevated above the grade of the street. As a part of its enterprise the Depot Company undertook the work of constructing
these tracks. The plaintiffs in error were the owners of a
manufacturing plant. The individual plaintiff in error held
the title in fee to the property and the corporation plaintiff in
erlor was his lessee. This manufacturing plant fronted on
River street, and fronted on that part of it where the tracks
were necessarily on a viaduct far above the surface. No part
of the ground actually occupied by the plant was sought to
be taken, but under the laws of Michigan the owner of a lot
fronting on a street owns to the centre of the highway and
is entitled to recover damages in case that street is appropriated to the use of a railroad. The third clause in section
4 of the Union Depot act (1 How. Comp. ยง 3461) provides
specifically that the amount of these damages shall be ascer-

tained in the same way as is provided in ordinary cases of
condemnation.
The constitution of Michigan provides:
Article XV, Section 9. "The property of no person shall
be taken by any corporation for public use without compensation being first made or secured, in such manner as may be
prescribed by law."
Article XVIII, Section 2. "When private property is taken
for the use or benefit of the public, the necessity for using such
property, and the just compensation to be made therefor,
except when to be made by the State, shall be ascertained by
a jury of twelve freeholders, residing in the vicinity of such
property, or by not less than three commissioners, appointed
by a court of record, as shall be prescribed by law."
The Michigan Union Depot act (Act of June 9, 1881, 1o.
224) was passed in 1881. Public Acts, 1881, p. 320. It prescribes proceedings for the condemnation of private property,
substantially similar to those in the Michigan General Railroad Law, first passed in 1855. Act of February 12, 1855,

company of the land appraised; and when the same is made
by others than the company, it shall not be heard except on a

The proceedings were commenced in the usual form by a
petition filed by the Depot Company, January 24, 1891, in the
circuit court for the county of Wayne, in which county the
city of Detroit is situate.
The plaintiffs in error, respondents below, demanded a jury.
The first hearing commenced on February 25, 1891, and terminated on March 18,1891, in a disagreement of the jury upon
both issues, that of necessity and that of compensation. A
second hearing was had, commencing on June 10, 1891, and
resulting on July 16, 1891, in a verdict in favor of the Depot
Company on the question of public necessity, and assessing the
damages of the respondents as follows: To Absalom Backus,
Jr., as the owner of the fee, $17,850; to the corporation, A.
Backus, Jr., & Sons, $78,293. At neither of these hearings
was the judge of the circuit court present. Upon the motion
of the Depot Company the circuit court vacated the award of
damages, and ordered that a new jury be empanelled. Thereupon the respondents applied to the Supreme Court of the
State for a writ of mandamus, to compel the setting aside of
this order. That court, on November 19, 1891, issued a peremptory writ of mandamus, as prayed for. 89 Michigan, 210.
On November 30, 1891, the circuit court, in compliance with
this writ, entered an order which, as amended, confirmed the
verdict and award of the jury, and also provided as follows:
"It is further ordered that within sixty days from the date
of this order the Fort Street Union Depot Company is required
to tender and pay to Absalom Backus, Jr., the sum of seven-

teen thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars, and to A. Backus,
Jr., & Sons the sum of seventy-eight thousand two hundred and
ninety-three dollars, and to James N. Dean and William H.
Davidson, executors, the sum of one dollar, together with their
costs and expenses, if the same have been taxed, including an
attorney's fee of twenty-five dollars; and if the said parties or
either of them refuse to accept the tender and payment of said
sums, the Fort Street Union Depot Company is required to
deposit the same, under the supervision of the clerk of this
court, in the Detroit National Bank and to the credit of this
cause, including said costs and expenses; provided, that if said
costs and expenses have not been taxed within the said sixty
days, the same to be so deposited within five days after they
are taxed.
"Said money shall remain on deposit in said bank, but at
the risk of the petitioner, subject to be drawn therefroin and
to be paid to the parties entitled to the same on orders signed
by one of the judges of this court and countersigned by the
clerk.
"It is further ordered that upon the tender and payment or
deposit of said sum of ninety-six thousand one hundred and
forty-four dollars, and of said costs, expenses and counsel fees,
as aforesaid, the said Fort Street Union Depot Company shall
be entitled to enter upon and take possession of and use the
right of way above described for the purpose of its incorporation under its articles of association and the constitution and
laws of this State, and that said respondent shall be divested
and barred of all right, estate and interest in such right of way
until such right or title shall be again legally vested in them
and said right of way shall be deemed to have been acquired
by said company for public use."
On December 2, 1891, the Depot Company appealed from
the award of the jury, and from the confirmation thereof, to
the Supreme Court of the State. On January 26, 1892, the
Depot Company paid to the respondents, and they received,
the amounts awarded to them, and thereupon the Depot
Company took full possession of the property, constructed its
tracks and has been ever since in possession and use of them.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statement of the Case.

On March 3, 1892, the appeal was argued in the Supreme
Court, and on June 10, 1892, its decision was announced. 92
Michigan, 33. It was held by a majority of the court (the Chief
Justice dissenting) that the opinion expressed on the granting of the mandamus had too narrowly restricted the powers of the circuit court, and it was ordered that the verdict
of the jury, while confirmed so far as it determined the
question of necessity, should be vacated and set aside so
far as it awarded compensation; and that the cause be remanded to the circuit court, with directions to proceed with
a new appraisal, the costs of the appeal to abide the event of
such appraisal.
It was also held that the fact that the amount of the award
and confirmation had been paid to the respondents and the
property taken possession of by the Depot Company since
the taking of the appeal did notaffect the right of the Depot
Company to a new trial upon the question of compensation.
When the case was returned to the circuit court the respondents objected to any further proceedings, but the same
were overruled, and a jury empanelled. The sessions of this
jury were presided over by the circuit judge, and, after hearing the testimony and examining the property, it returned a
verdict, assessing the damages of the individual respondent
at the sum of $15,000, and of the corporation respondent at
the sum of $48,000. Thereupon, on motion of the Depot
Company, and on December 28, 1893, the circuit court entered a judgment against the individual respondent for $2850,
the difference between the amount of the first and second
awards, and a like judgment against the corporation respondent for $30,293, and also a judgment against both respondents for the costs of the appeal and subsequent proceedings
taxed: at $4168.20. On the 26th of June, 1891, the respondents filed their petition in the Supreme Court of the State
of:Michigan, praying for a writ of certiorari. The writ was
allowed, whereby the entire record was transferred to that
court, which, in an opinion filed on January 8, 1895, affirmed
the proceedings below, with costs. 103 Michigan, 556. Whereupon the plaintiffs below sued out this writ of error.

Opinion of the Court.

Don -f. Dickinson for plaintiffs in error.

:MR. 3UsTuE BREwER, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
Inasmuch as the respondents, both on the trial in the circuit
court and in the subsequent proceedings on the certiorari in
the Supreme Court, specifically set up and claimed rights under
the Federal Constitution which were denied, the jurisdiction
of this court is not open to doubt. They again and again
insisted that certain provisions of the Federal Constitution,
which they named, stood in the way of any further proceedings against them.
It is also not open to further debate, since the decision in
Chicago, Burlington c Quincy Railroad v. Chicago, 166
U. S. 226, that this court may examine proceedings had in
a state court, under state authority, for the appropriation of
private property to public purposes, so far as to inquire
whether that court prescribed any rule of law in disregard
of the owner's right to just compensation. But in this respect we quote the restriction placed in the opinion then filed

(p. 246):
"We say, 'in absolute disregard of the company's right to
just compensation,' because we do not wish to be understood
as holding that every order or ruling of the state court in a
case like this may be reviewed here, notwithstanding our
jurisdiction, for some purposes, is beyond question. Many
matters may occur in the progress of such cases that do not
necessarily involve, in any substantial sense, the Federal right
alleged to have been denied; and in respect of such matters,
that which is done or omitted to be done by the state court
may constitute only error in the administration of the law
under which the proceedings were instituted."
While in cases of this kind coming from the Supreme Court
of a State, questions of fact passed upon in the state courts
are not here open to review, Egan.,v. flart, 165 U. S. 188, and

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

cases cited in the opinion, it may not be inappropriate to notice
that the award of compensation as finally sustained gave
to the respondents the sum of $63,000. As the valuation
they placed upon the plant, outside of the realty, was only
$150,000, and of the realty the like sum of $150,000, though
the realty cost in 1871 less than $30,000, and as none of the
ground, upon which the plant stood and the business was
carried on, was taken by the Depot Company, but only the
use of the street in front thereof, and that not so as to exclude
them from its use, it is obvious that the award, whether adequate or not, was not one in reckless disregard of their
rights..
It is not questioned by counsel that the settled rule of this
court in cases of this kind is to accept the construction placed
by the Supreme Court of the State upon its own constitution
and statutes as correct. Long Island Water Supply Company
v. Brooklyn, 166 U. S. 685; Jierchants' & .1fanacturers'
Bank v. Pennsylvania, 167 U. S.461, and cases cited in those
opinions. His contention, however, is that the true construction of the constitution and laws of the State, as settled by
repeated decisions of its Supreme Court, was wholly disregarded in this case, and that by reason thereof the respondents were denied that equal protection of the laws which is
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal
Constitution. His contentions are grouped under the following heads:
"I. They were denied the fundamental right to have an
ascertainment and determination of the amount of compensation and its final payment before being deprived of their
property.
"II. They were denied the protection of that guaranty of
the state constitution providing that the questions of compensation and necessity should be passed upon by one and the
same jury, and of the settled, uniform and unreversed construction of the constitution to that effect by the state
judiciary in respect of all other citizens.
"Il. They were denied the protection of a trial on the
questions of necessity and compensation by the tribunal

BACKUS v. FORT STREET UNION DEPOT CO.

567-

Opinion of the Court.

guaranteed by the constitution of the State, in accordance
'with the settled, uniform and unreversed construction of that
constitution in respect of all other citizens.
"IV. They were denied that measure of just compensation
for their property taken, guaranteed by the constitutions,
Federal and state, as the same was and is accorded to all
other persons than themselves.
"V. They were denied a hearing and deprived of a hearing
guaranteed by the Constitutions, Federal and state, as 'due
process of law,' when sumnoned into court as appellees to
defend their property, rights and themselves from imputations
upon them.
'VI. Finally, having been deprived of their property
sought by the railroad company for its purposes, their
personal assets of the value of one hundred and ten thousand
($110,000) dollars were taken from them under the color of
a judgment and process unknown to the constitution and
statutes of Michigan, and unknown to jurisprudence, whereby
they were deprived of their property without ' due process of
law.' "
Attention is called to the fact that while upon the return
of the first verdict the respondents moved to confirm it, which
motion was denied by the circuit court and the verdict set
aside, yet after the decision of the Supreme Court awarding
the writ of mandamus, they did not renew that motion; that
the petitioner alone asked for confirmation, though, as expressly stated, for the purpose of taking an appeal to the Supreme Court; that, after the order of confirmation had been
entered, it paid the amount of the award to the respondents,
which sum was accepted by them, and that thereupon it took
possession of the property and has since continued in undisturbed possession and use. It is insisted that such payment
and taking possession created under the constitution' and
statutes of Michigan a finality so far as the Depot Company
was concerned, and that to this effect had been the repeated
adjudications of the Supreme Court of the State. The argament is that the property owner has a constitutional right to
have the amount of his compensation finally determined and

OCTOBER TERIU, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

paid before yielding possession; that the party seeking con-*
detnnation (in this case the Depot Company) cannot be let
into possession until after all question as to the compensation
has been finally settled, and the amount thereof paid; that it
cannot take advantage of one report or verdict, pay the sum
fixed by it, obtain possession, and still litigate the question of
amount; that if it does then pay and take possession its right
to further litigate is ended. But the Supreme Court of the
State held against this contention, and we must assume therefrom that it is not warranted by the constitution and statutes
of the State. Indeed, the language of that constitution is
"made or secured." Does this amount to a denial of the
right to that protection to property which is guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution? In
other words, is it beyond the power of a State to authorize
in condemnation cases the taking of possession prior to the
final determination of the amount of compensation and payment thereof? This question is fully answered by the opinions of this court in Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas
Railway, 135 U. S. 641, and Sweet v. Rechel, 159 U. S. 380.
There can be no doubt that if adequate provision for compensation is made authority may be granted for taking possession
pending inquiry as to the amount which must be paid and
before any final determination thereof.
Neither can it be said that there is any fundamental right
secured by the Constitution of the United States to have the
questions of compensation and necessity both passed upon by
one and the same jury. In many States the question of necessity is never submitted to the jury which passes upon the
question of compensation. It is either settled affirmatively
by the legislature, or left to the judgment of the corporation
invested with the right to take property by condemnation.
The question of necessity is not one of a judicial character,
but rather one for determination by the lawmaking branch of
the government. Boom Company v. Patterson, 98 U. S.403,
406; United States v. Jones, 109 U. S.513; Cherokee Vation,
v. Kansas Railway Company, sulra.
Neither was there anything in the proceedings actually had

Opinion of the Court.

before the last jury and in the Circuit Court which conflicts
with any mandate of the Federal Constitution. Counsel say
that the respondents were entitled to a trial by a jury of inquest, but were forced to trial before a common law jury,
presided over and controlled by the circuit judge. But the
Constitution of the United States does not forbid a trial of
the -question of the amount of compensation before an ordinary common law jury, or require, on the other hand, that it
must be before such a jury. It is within the power of the
State to provide that the amount shall be determined in the
first instance by commissioners, subject to an appeal to
the courts for trial in the ordinary way; or it may provide
that the question shall be settled by a sheriff's jury, as it was
constituted at common law, without the presence of a trial
judge. These are questions of procedure which do not enter
into or form the basis of fundamental right. All that is essential is that in some appropriate way, before some properly
constituted tribunal, inquiry shall be made as to the amount
of compensation, and when this has been provided there is
that due process of law which is required by the Federal
Constitution. Baaman v. Ross, 167 U. S. 548, 593. These
considerations dispose of all the objections embraced in the
first three contentions of counsel so far as those objections
run to the validity of the proceedings actually had, providing
those proceedings were warranted by the constitutioh and
statutes of the State.
But it is insisted that those proceedings were not so warranted; that the settled, uniform and unreversed construction
thereof by the Supreme Court of the State theretofore forbade
them, and hence there was a discrimination against the respondents, and they were denied that equal protection of the
laws which the Federal Constitution guarantees. Thus, for
instance, it is insisted that the previous rulings of the courts,
both trial and Supreme, had been to the effect that a jury
called under these condemnation statutes was a jury of inquest
and not a trial jury, whereas in this case the ruling was practically to the contrary, and the respondents were compelled
to submit their rights to a trial jury, subject to the control of

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

the presiding judge, as in ordinary common law cases.

We

deem it unnecessary to review the many authorities from the

Supreme Court of Michigan cited by counsel, or determine
whether the ruling in this case as to methods of procedure and
the true construction of the statute is or is not in harmony
with prior decisions of that court. Accepting the contention
of counsel, that in this case the Supreme Court of the State
has put a different construction on the state statutes from
that theretofore given, and has sustained modes of procedure
different from those which had previously obtained, still it
does not follow that this court has a right to interfere and say
that the present ruling is erroneous and the prior construction
correct, or that the change of construction works a denial of
any fundamental rights. There is no vested right in a mode
of procedure. Each succeeding legislature may establish a
different one, providing only that in each are preserved the
essential elements of protection. The fact that one construction has been placed upon a statute by the highest court of
the State does not make that construction beyond change.
Suppose it were true, in the fullest sense of counsel's contention, that for a series of years the courts had ruled that the
jury in condemnation cases was a jury of inquest, or in the
nature of a sheriff's jury-one determining for itself all matters of law and fact, and that in this case, for the first time,
they held otherwise, and that such jury was a common law
jury, subject to be controlled by the presiding judge, whose
duty it was to determine all questions of law, and still, whatever might be thought of the propriety of such a change of
construction, there is in it nothing to justify this court in reversing the judgment of the state court and denying the
correctness or validity of this last ruling. We fail to see why
the presence of the judge with this jury, his assumption of
power to control its proceedings, his instructions to it on questions of law, necessarily vitiated the proceedings. Grant that
such a course had never been taken before; grant that it
had never been held to be a proper proceedinag; grant that it
was unexpected by counsel, and yet if the judge's rulings and
instructions were in themselves correct, and the propriety of

BACKUS v. FORT STREET UNION DEPOT CO.

5T1

Opinion of the Court.

his presence and control be held by the Supreme Court of the
State warranted by the statutes, we do not perceive that any
right possessed under the Constitution of the United States
has been violated.
The question is not presented of a distinct ruling by a state
court that one party is entitled to certain rights and the benefits of certain modes of procedure, and that another party
similarly situated is not entitled to them. An act of the
legislature which in terms gave to one individual certain
rights and denied to another similarly situated the same
rights might be challenged on the ground of unjust discritnination and a denial of the equal protection of the laws. But
that does not prevent a legislature, which has established a
certain rule of procedure, and continued it in force for years,
from subsequently repealing the act and establishing an
entirely different mode of procedure. In other words, there
is no absolute right vested in the individual as against the
power of the legislature to change modes of procedure. Andโข
a similar thought controls where the courts of the State have
construed a statute as prescribing one fom of procedure, and
parties have acted under that construction, and then subsequently the same court has held that the statute was theretofore misconstrued, and really provided a different mode of
procedure. This last adjudication cannot be set aside in the
Federal courts on the ground of an unjust discrimination or a
denial of the equal protection of the laws.
We, of course, do not mean to affirm that there has been
by the Supreme Court of the State such a change of adjudication. We simply in this respect accept the contention of
counsel for the respondents, and hold that, even if the facts
be as claimed by him, they furnish no ground for interference
by this court. It should be noticed in passing, however, that
nearly all, if not absolutely all, of the cases which he cites
from the Supreme Court of Michigan arose under the provisions respecting condemnation in the General Railroad Act,
while these proceedings were had under the Union Depot
Act, and, although the two acts may be substantially similar,
yet this adjudication is under a different statute from that

OCTOBER TER-M, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

under which most, if not all, of the prior decisions were
made.
Passing now to the fourth point. Under this it is claimed
that the trial judge gave to the jury an improper measure of
damages. During the argument of counsel for the respondents this colloquy took place, as appears from the record:
"CounT: A question which arises in my mind is this:
There is no. question but what the Backuses are entitled to
full compensation for such damages as they may suffer, but
does not the other rule also attach, and that is, that the jury
are not in any way to consider any speculative damages or
any probable damages?
"MR. DioxsoN: They can only consider the damages
which are actually shown, but the other rule follows, may it
please your honor, that they are not to estimate those damages for a year, or estimate the present injury done by the
railroad, but they must assume that the railroad is running to
its maximum capacity, that it has other railroads, that it may
double, treble or quadruple its trains, so far as that is concerned, and they must estimate the damage for the future
time, not for a year or three years or five years or ten years.
"CoutnT: That is undoubtedly true to a certain extent, but
the question that I have thought about considerably within
the last few days is in regard, to the testimony which was
admitted in the case in regard to their profits, the profits of
their business. Do they not come within the rule which
applies in regard to speculative damages?"
Afterwards, when the counsel for petitioner was making his
argument, he said:
"In other words, if the court please, the question as to what
business is carried on there, and as to how profitable an institution it might be is merely an element to be considered in
establishing the market value of the property."
Upon which the judge made this comment:
"In other words, if a profitable business is carried on in connection with a certain site, the profitableness of the business
itself must be taken into consideration by the jury in estimating the value ?"

BACKUS v. FORT STREET UNION DEPOT CO.

573

Opinion of the Court.

After the arguments were over the judge charged the jury
as follows:
"Upon this question, viz., compensation or damages, what I
have to say must necessarily be in a broad and the most general way. This is a question for you, and from the very nature
of a proceeding of this character, you are vested with large
powers and great discretion. These powers and this discretion
should not be exercised arbitrarily, nor without proper regard
for substantial justice. You should bear in mind that the
greater the power, the more jealous is the law of its careful
exercise, and the greater is the responsibility of the persons
vested therewith. You should exercise a cool, careful, intelligent and unbiassed judgment. The compensation or damages
must be neither inadequate or excessive, and your award must
not furnish a just inference of the existence of undue influence,
partiality, bias and prejudice, or unfaithfulness in the discharge
of the duties imposed upon you. You must, however, remember that the respondents' property is taken, or its enjoyment
interfered with, under the so-called power of eminent domain,
a power somewhat and necessarily arbitrary in its character,
and that where this is done the party whose property is taken,
or whose enjoyment or use of the property is interfered with,
is entitled to full compensation.for the injury inflicted. While
the allowance to be made should be liberal, still it must not be
unreasonably exorbitant or grossly excessive. It should be a
fair and liberal allowance and full and adequate compensation
for the damages inflicted. You should not allow too little nor
should you allow too much. Your award should be based upon
that which is real and what is substantial, and not upon what
is either fictitious or speculative. You should look at the condition of things as they exist. Under the constitution and
laws the right to take another's property for public uses, the
power to exercise the right of eminent domain, is a part of the
law of the land, but when this power is exercised it can only
be done by giving the party whose property is taken or whose
use and enjoyment of such property is interfered with, full and
adequate compensation, not excessive or exorbitant, but just
compensation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

"I shall not call attention to any particular part of the testimony in the case: the responsibility of its application and
the weight to be given itrests with you, always regarding that
which is real and substantial and disregarding that which is
fictitious and speculative; treating conditions as they have been
shown and as they are, without speculating as to what might
possibly happen or occur, taking conditions as you find them,
and the natural and probable consequences following such conditions."
And this was all which was said in reference to the measure
of compensation. Now, it is insisted by counsel that the profits
which the manufacturing plant was making were to be taken
into consideration by the jury in awarding compensation, inasmuch as the business of that plant was seriously interrupted,
if not practically destroyed, by this condemnation; that inasmuch as the query was suggested by the judge during the argument whether profits did not come within the rule as to
speculative damages, the failure to charge distinctly that they
were proper subjects of consideration was equivalent to an instruction that they were not to be considered, and that, therefore, the true rule of compensation was not given to the jury.
It is evident that the judge did not attempt to define the
several elements which enter into the general fact of compensation, or the various matters to be considered by the jury.
le simply charged generally that as this was an arbitrary
taking of the property of the respondents they were entitled
to full compensation, and left to the jury the duty of determining what should be such compensation, telling them plainly
that they were vested with large powers and great discretion.
If it be said that the judge had intimated by his query that
the matter of profits came within the rule applicable to speculative damages, it must also be noticed that further on he suggested that the profitableness of a business was to be taken
into consideration in estimating the value. It is true he nowhere instructed the jury to make the profits of the business the
criterion of value, nor indeed would he have been justified in
so doing. The profitableness of the business was undoubtedly
a matter to be considered, and so the judge fairly intimated in

BACKUS v. FORT STREET UNION DEPOT CO.

575

Opinion of the Court.

these prior colloquies. But the profits of a business are not
destroyed unless the business is not only there stopped, but
also one which in its nature cannot be carried on elsewhere.
If it can be transferred to a new place and there prosecuted
successfully, then the total profits are not appropriated, and the
injury is that which flows from the change of location.
But beyond this no special instructions were asked by the
respondents at the time of the giving of the charge. The
statute (ยง 3466) provides that the judge "may attend said
jury, to decide questions of law." So far as he gave instructions it is obvious that he stated that which was the law, and
the real objection is that he did not go further and enter into
a more minute description of the elements which were to be
taken into consideration by the jury in fixing the amount of
compensation; that they may from the colloquies which had
taken place during the arguments have drawn improper inferences as to the limit to which they were warranted in
going, and that those inferences he failed to correct by
specifically stating what matters they should consider. A
sufficient answer is that the respondents did not ask any
further instructions. All they did was to except to what had
been stated. By well-settled rules no appellate court would
under such circumstances be required to set aside the judgment of the trial court. Skutte v. Tiormpson, 15 Wall. 151,
164; .Xutual Life Ins. Co. v. Snyder, 93 U. S. 393; Texas
Pacific Railway v. Volk, 151 U. S. 73; .1saacsv. United States,
159 U. S. 487.
But a more complete and satisfactory answer is that whatever error there may have been affords no ground for the interference of this court. The respondents were not thereby
deprived of any rights secured by the Federal Constitution.
They were not denied "due process of law." The proceedings were had before a duly constituted tribunal, in accordance with the declared law of the State, with full opportunity
to be heard. Nor were they denied "the equal protection of
the laws." The rule as to the necessity of asking special instructions was administered in this case no differently than in
'others. .farakant v. Pennsylvania Railroad,153 U. S.380.

OCTOBER TERMT,

1897.

Opinion of the Court.

The error, if any there be, was not one "in absolute disregard
of their right to just compensation," but was only error in the
administration of the law under which those proceedings were
instituted. As clearly pointed out in Chicago, Burlington d-

Quincy Railroad v. Chicago, supra, it is not every error occurring in a state court in the administration of its law concerning condemnation of private property for public purposes
that opens the door to review by this court. We are not called
upon to search the record simply to inquire whether there may
or may not have been errors in the proceedings. Our limit of
interference is reached when it appears that no fundamental
rights have been disregarded by the state tribunals.
Under the fifth head counsel presents two matters:
"(1) The denial by the Supreme Court of the State of a
hearing on the substantial and essential question, of whether
counsel for plaintiffs in error abused their privilege as counsel
by arguing to the jury on the question of necessity that the
margin of the depot grounds that belonged to the Michigan
Central road could be taken for the elevated structure; and
(2) the reversal of the unanimous judgment of the Supreme
Court of the State in 89 Michigan, 209, without a rehearing,
by the judgment in 92 Michigan, 33."
With reference to the first, it is enough to say that the
respondents did not appeal to the Supreme Court, and that
under section 3468 it would seem that that court was called
upon to consider only such objections as had been particularly
specified. "Either party may appeal, by notice in writing;"
"such notice shall specify the objections ;" "the Supreme
Court shall pass on such objections only, and all other objections, if any, shall be deemed to have been waived." No
objection to the finding of the jury as to the question of
necessity had been made by the appellant, and therefore was
to be treated as waived. Under those circumstances it cannot
be said that the Supreme Court deprived the respondents of
any rights by refusing to hear counsel in respect to the question of necessity, or connected with its determination.
With regard to the second, technically the decision on the
mandamus proceeding and that on the appeal did not conflict.

BACKUS v. FORT STREET UNION DEPOT CO.

577

Opinion of the Court.

The writ of mandamus directed the circuit judge to set aside
the order which he had entered vacating the award. It thus
in effect declared that that judge ought not to have. made
such an order. On the appeal the Supreme Court itself
ordered that the award be set aside, and a new jury empanelled, and remanded it to the Circuit Court for such new
appraisaL This is within the letter of the statute, (ยง 3468,)
"on the hearing of such appeal, the court may direct a new
appraisal before the same or new commissioners or jury, in
its discretion." The decision by the Supreme Court that it
had power to set aside the verdict and order a new appraisal
was not a reversal of a ruling that the Circuit Court had no
such power, although it may suggest consequences somewhat
singular. Appreciating that fact, in the last opinion the court
declared that in the former decision its language restricting
the power of the Circuit Court had been too strong.
Coming now to the last point, the Supreme Court held that
as upon the second appraisal the damages were less than those,
awarded on the first, and the amount of the first had been
paid to the respondents, the petitioner was entitled to a judgment for the difference. The language of the statute (ยง 3468)
is "but if the amount is diminished, the difference shall be
refunded to the company by the party to whom the same may
have been paid, and judgments therefor and for all costs of
the appeal shall be rendered against the party so appealing."
It may be that this language is not entirely apt, for in this
case the party appealing was not the landowner but the
Depot Company, and so it cannot be said that judgments were
rendered against "the party appealing." But the true intent
of the statute is obvious, and at any rate we are bound to
accept the construction placed upon it by the Supreme Court,
and hold that it means that if the last appraisal was less than
the first and the amount of the first had been paid, the company was entitled to recover the difference from the party to
whom it had been paid. Nothing is said, it is true, in the
statute about execution, but the Supreme Court ruled that
under the general statutes the recovery of the judgment
carried with it a right to an execution.

These are all the questions in this case. We find nothing
in them which justifies an interference by this court with the
proceedings of the state courts; nothing in which it can be
said that any ruling of those courts was in absolute disregard
of the respondents' right to compensation. The judgment
must, therefore, be
Affirmed.
MRn. Jusric HARLA_ dissenting.
Did the trial court prescribe any rule of law for the guidance of the jury that was in absolute disregard of the right of
'the plaintiffs in error to such compensation?
In Chicago, Bzmlingtort & Quincy Railroad v. Chicago,
166 IT. S. 226, 241, it was held that "a judgment of a state
court, even if it be authorized by statute, whereby private
property is taken for the State or under its direction for
public use, without compensation made or secured to the
owner, is, upon principle and authority, wanting in the due
process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States, and the affirmance of such
judgment by the highest court of the State is a denial by that
State of a right secured to the owner by that instrument."
Before proceeding with his argument to the jury, Mr.
Dickinson, the attorney for the plaintiffs in error, called the
attention of the trial court to some of the principles which, in
his judgment, should control the ascertainment of the just
compensation to which they were entitled. Addressing the
court in the presence of the jury, he said: "Now, as to what
is compensation, I refer your honor to the case of The Grand
Rapids & Indiana Railroad v. fleisel, in 47 M ichigan, 398:
'It need hardly be said that nothing can be fairly termed
compensation which does not put the party injured in as good
a condition as he would have been if the injury had not
occurred. Nothing short of this is adequate compensation.
In the case of land actually taken, it includes its value, or the
amount to which the value of the property from which it is
taken is depreciated, and in Jubb v. 17ull Dock Co., 9 Q. B.
443, it was held, where the property taken was a brewery in

BACKUS v. FORT STREET UNION DEPOT CO.

579

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

operation, the damages included the necessary loss in finding
another place of business. In cases where damage is by injury
aside from the actual taking of property, the rule has been to
make the party whole as nearly as practicable, and where it
affected the rental value or enjoyment the same principle has
been applied as in other cases. There is no reason, and so far
as we can discover, no law which allows the wrongdoer to
cast any portion of an actual and appreciable loss on the party
whom he injures.' (In this case the same rule of damages
would apply as in the Grand Rapids and Indiana case, and
the suit was brought for damages, and the question was what
was compensation.) 'In such a case as this, it is in the power
of the company and always has been to have the compensation
settled, once for all, and to get any benefit which the law
attaches to such a method of ascertainment. Until this is
done the possession is a continual wrong.' "
At this point the court interrupted the argument of counsel
with this observation: "
question which arises in my mind
is this: There is no question but what the Backuses are entitled to full compensation for such damages as they may
suffer, but does not the other rule also attach, and that is, that
the jury are not in any way to consider any speculative damages or any probable damages? " To this counsel made the
following response: "They can only consider the damages
which are actually shown, but the other rule follows, may it
please your honor, that they are not to estimate those damages
for a year, or estimate the present injury done by the railroad,
but they must assume that the railroad is running to its
maximum capacity, that it has other railroads, that it may
double, treble or quadruple its trains, so far as that is concerned, and they must estimate the damage for the future
time, not for a year or three years or five years or ten years."
The court then said: "That is undoubtedly true to a certain
extent, but the question that I have thought about considerably within the last few days is in regard to the testimony
which was admitted in the case in regard to their profits, the
profits of their business. Do they not come within the rule
which applies in regard to speculative damages ?"

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.

Counsel then observed: "Not at all, your honor. If the
profits are shown and the business is destroyed, you can only
show it by the effect upon the business, and upon that point I
call your honor's attention to the unanimous opinion of the
Supreme Court delivered by Mr. Justice Campbell in the case
of GrandRapids & Indiana Railroadv. leiden,70 Michigan,.
390, 393: 1Under our present constitution there is never any
presumption that a railroad is necessary, or that any particular
land ought to be given up to its uses. Every landowner therefore has a perfect right to object to giving up his land, and
is not confined to objections depending upon price or value.
. . . And a road already established has no better claim
than any other to extend or change its lines. Although railroads are allowed by public policy to condemn lands, because
they cannot exist otherwise, nevertheless the enterprise is,
under our laws, which prohibit public ownership of railways,
one of private interest and emolmuent, and must show its
claims to legal 'assistance.' Now upon the question of profits:
'We are bound to see that parties are not deprived of their
property without necessity, or without, full compensation for
being compelled to relinquish it. And, while respect is due to
the honest action of juries, it is not conclusive, and is subject
to comparison with the facts in the record. Both of the appellants were using their property in lucrative business, in
which the locality and its surroundings had some bearing on
its value. Apart from the money value of the property itself,
they were entitled to be compensated so as to lose nothing by
the interruption of their business and its damage by the change.
A business stand is of some value to the owner of the business, whether he owns the fee'of the land or not, and a diminution of business facilities may lead to serious results. There
may be cases when the loss of a particular location may destroy business altogether for want of access to any other that
is suitable for it. Whatever damage is suffered must be compensated. Appellants are not legally bound to suffer for petitioner's benefit. Petitioner can only be authorized to oust
them from their possessions by making up to them the whole
of their losses.' That goes directly upon the question which

BACKUS v. FORT STREET UNION DEPOT CO.

581

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

your honor suggests. Now I shall not take time to refer to
the other cases."
I cannot doubt, from what passed between the court and
counsel in the presence of the jury, that the court meant to
characterize profits from the business of the parties owning
the real estate as speculative damages.
After the counsel for the parties concluded their argument
to the jury upon the whole case, the trial judge delivered a
carefully prepared charge, in which he said: "The question,
and the only question before you for your determination, is
that of compensation, and of compensation only. Your duty,
and your only duty, is to ascertain and determine what compensation or damages ought justly to be paid by the Fort
Street Union Depot Company to the respondents for the real
estate, property, franchises, easements and privileges described
in the petition, viz.: 1. The amount to be allowed to Absalom
Backus, Jr., as the owner of the fee of the land described.
2. The amount to be allowed to A. Backus, Jr., & Sons, a
corporation, as tenants in possession of such lands. Upon this
question, viz., compensation or damages, what I have to say
must necessarily be in a broad and the most general way.
This is a question for you, and from the very nature of a proceeding of this character you are vested with large powers and
great discretion. These powers and this discretion should not
be exercised arbitrarily, nqr without proper regard for substantial justice. You should bear in mind that the greater the
power the more jealous is the law of its careful exercise, and
the greater is the responsibility of the persons vested therewith. You should exercise a cool, careful, intelligent and unbiassed judgment. The compensation or damages must be
neither inadequate or excessive, and your award must not
furnish a just inference of the existence of undue influence,
partiality, bias and prejudice, or unfaithfulness in the discharge
of the duties imposed upon you, You must, however, remember that the respondents' property is taken, or its enjoyment
interfered with under the so called power of eminent domain,
a power somewhat and necessarily arbitrary in its character,
and that where this is done the party whose property is taken,

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

or whose enjoyment or use of the property is interfered with,
is entitled to full compensation for the injury inflicted. While
the allowance to be made should be liberal, still it must not be
unreasonably exorbitant or grossly excessive. It should be a
fair and liberal allowance and full and adequate compensation
for the damages inflicted. You should not allow too little nor
should you allow too much. Your award should be based
upon that which is real and what is substantial, and not upon
what is either fictitious or speculative. You should look at
the conditions of things as they exist. Under the constitution
and laws the right to take another's property for public uses,
the power to exercise the right of eminent domain, is a part
of the law of the land, but when this power is exercised it can
only be done by giving the party whose property is taken or
whose use and enjoyment of such property is interfered with,
full and adequate compensation, not excessive or exorbitant,
but just compensation."
Is it not clear that the trial judge, while indulging in very
general language as to the duty of the jury not to allow too
much or too little compensation, gave the jury to understand
that compensation was to be ascertained upon the basis only
of the ownership by Absalom Backus, Jr., of the fee in the
land described, and of the rights of A. Backus, Jr., & Sons as
tenants in possession, excluding damages to the business of the
plaintiffs in error, which would arise from the condemnation
of their property rights? The jury were, in effect, instructed
that the profits derived by them from their business were to
be excluded from consideration as being "fictitious or speculative."
That he was so understood by counsel for the plaintiffs in
error is manifest from the circumstance that, immediately
upon the charge being concluded, he made the following exceptions to it: "We except to that part of the charge of the court
wherein he says that the damages are to be confined to the
damage to the real estate described and the improvements
upon it; whereas, in our view, the damages are to the entire
plant, including the injury to the business from the impairment of the mill as affecting its adjuncts, the lumber yard and

BACKUS v. FORT STREET UNION DEPOT CO.

the storehouse.
To what is said by the court as to
avoiding the giving o0 speculative damages, in view of what
has been said before by the court in regard to taking into consideration the profits, I refer to what has been said upon the
records in the course of the testimony and upon the argument,
expressing the views of the court against taking into consideration the profits. We except to the refusal of the court to
charge as I requested in the language or in the substance,
according to the decisions of the Supreme Court, which I read
in full upon the opening of my argument and called attention
of the court to it, especially to the expression of Campbell, J.,
in delivering the opinion of the court in Grand Rapids &
Indiana Railroadv. Weiden, 70 Michigan, 395, 398."
If the trial judge did not intend to say to the jury that
injury to the business of the plaintiffs in error was to be
deemed speculative, and therefore to be excluded from consideration, he would instantly have said that no such impression was intended to be made as that indicated by the
exceptions taken to his charge.
The views expressed by counsel for the plaintiffs in error
as to the principles which should guide the jury in the matter
of compensation were sustained by the authorities. In addition to the cases in 4Tth and 70th Michigan above referred to,
reference may be made to many others decided by the Supreme
Court of Michigan.
In Commissionergv. cMicago &c. Railroad, 91 Michigan, 291,
which was a case of the condemnation of the lands of a railroad company, that court said: "If, therefore, their adjoining
land is rendered less valuable by the location of a public highway, or another railroad across its property, there is no reason
why they should not recover compensation therefor. Situated
near this crossing is a small tract of land used for warehouse
)urposes. It is insisted by the respondents that, by reason of
this crossing, this land, with the warehouse thereon, is rendered
less available and less valuable for the purposes for which it
was constructed and used. This was a proper element of damage, and should have been submitted to the jury."
At the same term the court, in Comnmiasioners v. Afoesta,

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

91 Michigan, 149,154, quoted with approval what had been said
in Grand Rapids Railroad Co. v. lFeiden, 70 Michigan, 295,
saying: "The constitutional provision entitling the owner of
private property, taken for public use; to just compensation,
has uniformly been construed to require full and adequate'
compensation. The rules to be applied in fixing the compensation are not necessarily the same as obtain in fixing damages
in actions upon contracts. The correct rule of compensation in
such cases is more nearly analogous to the remedy afforded in
an action in tort in which property rights have been interfered with without the owner's assent. In such cases damages for the interruption of the owner's business are allowed.
Allison v. Chandler, 11 Mich. 549." In City of Detroit v.
Brennan, 93 Michigan, 338, the court reaffirmed the doctrine
of the former cases, that the full measure of compensation
and the injury done to the business should be allowed, and
said: "The law considers the rights of the property and business carried on by the respondent as of equal consideration
and entitled to as much protection as the right of the city to
take the property and interfere with the business; and will
not permit the property to be taken and the business to be
interfered with, unless an actual public necessity exists for
the making of the improvement. . . . The element of
damages are: (1) The value of the property taken for the
opening of the street; the injury to the works and property
not taken, and left in the parcel of land from which the property is taken; (2) the injury to the business of the owner;
(3) compensation for all prospective loss or injury resulting
from the opening of the street, and the taking of the property
for that purpose."
See also Grand Rapids &c. Railroad v. Chesebro, 74 Michigan, 466, where the court said: "An owner has a right to be
indemnified for anything that he may have lost. The farming
test, which is the one petitioner sought to apply, would be of no
particular use in a great many cases of suburban lands. . .
The mere taking of four acres for a right of way could not be
regarded, in any sensible point of view, as compensated by
one tenth of the value of the forty acres, taking acre for acre.

BACKUS v. FORT STREET UNION DEPOT CO.

Dissenting Opinion: Harlan, J.

The damages in such a case must be such as to fully make
good all that results, directly or indirectly, to the injury of
the owners in the whole premises and interests affected, and
not merely the strip taken." Further: "The jury here, as
in all cases where no certain measure exists, must trust somewhat to their own judgnient. That is one of the purposes for
which juries of inquest are provided. They are expected to
view the premises and use their own senses. . . . But the
purpose throughout is to give all the damages which they
reasonably discover, past or present, and to result, but no
more. No one can read this record without seeing that the
jury did not deal fully with the case. It is manifest that
they gave no damages beyond what they assumed to be the
price of four acres by the acre. . . . It cannot be said
there is any real conflict as to the damages arising from the
cutting off one part from the other of the forty acres, and
this was left out altogether, unless they regarded the proofs of
value wantonly, which we cannot believe." See also Pearsall
v. Supervisors, 74 Michigan, 558; Barnes v. .Michigan Air
line, 65 Michigan, 251; G rand Rapids &c. Railroadv. Railroad,58 Michigan, 641, 648; Toledo cc. Railway v. Detroit&c.

Michigan, 528.
Without referring to other matters discussed at the bar and
in the elaborate brief of counsel, I place my dissent from the
opinion and judgment of the court upon the ground that the
trial court committed error in its charge to the jury as to
the principles which sh'uld guide them in determining the
just "ompensation to which the plaintiffs in error were entitled. The rules laid down by the Supreme Court of Michigan, in the cases above cited, as to what was just compensation,
were, I think, in accord with the principles that obtain in the
courts of the Union when determining the just compensation
to be made for private property taken for public use.
