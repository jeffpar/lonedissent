the performance of the conditions. For as it had power in
the first instance to make the grant without conditions, its
action in subsequently waiving or removing such conditions
was equivalent to an original grant without conditions.
We have not deemed it necessary to consider the matter of
limitations and laches. That.this is an old claim is evident,
seventy years having elapsed between its inception and its
prosecution. Whether it must also be adjudged a stale claim
and beyond judicial recognition need not be determined. The

lNo. 189.

Argued January 14, 17, 1893.-Decided February 21, 1898.

Btuart v. Hayden, 169 U. S. 1, affirmed to the point that when two courts
have reached the same conclusion on a question of fact, their finding will
not be disturbed unless it be clear that their conclusion was erroneous.
Metropolitan.NationaZ Bank v. St. Louis Dispatch Co., 149 U. S. 436, affirmed
to the point that courts of equity, in cases of concurrent jurisdiction,
consider themselves bound by the statutes of limitation which govern
actions at law.
In this case the court arrives at the conclusion, on the evidence, that if the
false representations as to the earned fees were made by Baker as
alleged, there was entire knowledge thereof by Cummings more than
three years before the filing of his bill, which is the time in which an
action at law for such a cause is barred in the District of Columbia, and
that the conduct of Cummings, in permitting Baker to go on and prosecute the claims as if they were his own, debars him from proceeding in a
court of equity; but in so holding the court must not be considered as
intimating that it concludes that there was either clear and convincing
proof, or even a preponderance of proof, that the sale was as claimed by
Cummings.

ary 1, 1890, by a bill filed on the equity side of the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia against Baker, the appellant.
In substance, the bill set forth the formation about the year
1874 of a partnership between Cummings and Baker for the
practice of law in the city of Washington ; that the expenses
were to be borne and the profits shared equally between the
partners ; that the firm some years thereafter became attorneys for the collection of claimq against the United States in
favor of certain inspectors of customs for arrears of pay claimed
to be due them. It alleged that on September 6, 1886, Cummings sold to Baker all his interest in the fees earned but not
then divided, and those yet to be earned from such claims, and
that there was consequently a dissolution of the partnership as
to these matters, but that it continued as to all other business
until September, 1889, when the partnership was dissolved.
The object of the bill was to procure a cancellation and annulment of the sale of the fees in inspector cases made as above
stated and of the written instrument of assignment by which
it was evidenced, on the ground of false representations
claimed to have been made by Baker to Cummings in the
negotiations for the sale, which representations were averred
to have brought about the consent to the sale and the execution of the assignment to carry out the same. The fraud specified was, in substance, this: That Baker had misrepresented
the amount of the fees then actually earned by the firm and
undivided between the partners on the inspectors' claims, for
which appropriations had then been made by Congress, by stating to Cummings that the then earned fees only equalled about
$20,000, when in truth and in fact they were, to the knowledge of Baker, about $32,000; that as to the future claims
then in the hands of the firm but not then allowed by the
Treasury Department or appropriated for by Congress, Baker
had knowingly largely understated the amount thereof by
representing them to be only $80,000, when in fact they then
amounted to about $275,000. The relief prayed was an annulment of the sale; a full settlement of the partnership affairs,
treating the fees in the inspector cases as being a part of the
partnership assets; and in aid of the final settlement which

Statement of the Case.

was asked, there was also a prayer that Baker be enjoined
from prosecuting an action instituted by him against Cummings, in December, 1889, to recover $2712.81 and interest,
it being averred that Baker's right to this amount was involved
in a settlement of the entire partnership affairs.
The answer of Baker denied that there had been any fraud
practised upon Cummings in the purchase of his interest in
the fees in the inspector cases, and the alleged misrepresentations as to both classes of fees, whether earned or to be earned,
was expressly denied. The averment, that the complainant
had sold his interest in the fees on a basis of his ownership of
one half therein, was directly traversed, and on the contrary
it was alleged that the assignment resulted from the following
circumstances and had been made upon these conditions: That
the existence of claims by inspectors of customs against the
Government had been discovered by Baker, and that he had
procured the business of prosecuting them for the firm for a
compensation, in most cases, of twenty-five per cent of the
sum collected, and had substantially by his own labors pressed
them to a successful issue, and that the result of his exertions
had been to earn for the partnership a considerable sum of
money, which bad been, prior to 1886, divided between the
partners equally; that during the course of the business Cummings had given little or no attention to the inspectors' claims,
but on the contrary had neglected not only these claims, but
the partnership affairs generally; that, in consequence of
these facts, for months prior to September, 1886, Baker had
determined to putan end to the partnership, and had so informed Cummings; that for the purpose of preventing this
dissolution and securing a continued association with him
(Baker) in business, which Cummings desired, an agreement
had been entered into between the partners that Cummings,
instead of taking an equal interest in the earnings of the firm
from the inspectors' cases, should dispose of his rights therein
on the basis of his having only a one-third instead of a one-half
interest; that on this agreement, as to the proportion in which
the partners should be entitled to the fees, and Cuinmings's
judgment of the future result of claims unallowed and unap-

propriated for, which were in their very nature largely conjectural, the sale was made for a consideration of $15,000 cash tobe paid by Baker to Cummings, the latter to retain in addition
the full amount of all fees due to him for his services as assignee of an insolvent banking firm, which latter amount,
without the release, it was averred, would have been an asset
of the partnership, and was estimated to equal $10,000, of
which Baker's share would have been one half.
The answer, moreover, averred that at the time of the sale
Cummings had full information of the condition of the business in the inspector cases and dealt with his eyes open; that
as a partner he was not only familiar with the general manner
in which the business was conducted, but also, about two
weeks prior to the sale, he received from Baker papers and
documents which fully informed him of the exact condition
of the claims, his interest in which it was proposed to sell, the
papers and documents in question having been handed to
Cummings during the pendency of the negotiations in order
that he might ascertain the precise situation.
In addition, the answer averred that immediately after the
sale, and before Cummings had cashed a check for $15,000,
given him by Baker in payment of the amount of the purchase
price, Cummings was put in possession of papers and documents which were acted upon by him, and which, if any
fraudulent representation had been made in relation to the sale,
fully informed him of the fact in ample time to have protected
his interest: and although this full information was given
him, before the purchase price was collected, Cummings made
no pretence of any deceit practised upon him, or made any
complaint as to the contract, but continued in the partnership
as a member of the firm as to other business, and that the
first complaint which was made by him of any unfairness in
the transaction was nearly three years after the sale, and then
only after Baker had insisted upon payment to him by Cummings of a sum which Baker claimed was due him, and had
moreover expressed his unalterable intention to dissolve the
partnership. The defence of the bar of the statute of limitations was specially pleaded.

BAKER v. CUMMINGS.
Opinion of the Court.

At the hearing a decree was entered for complainant, and a
reference was made to an auditor to state the accounts between the parties. Pending the hearing on such reference, an
appeal from the interlocutory decree was prosecuted to the
Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, where a judgment of affirmance was rendered. 4 App. D. C. 230. Subsequently, on confirmation of the report of the auditor, a final
decree was entered in favor of the complainant for the sum of
$32,772.14, with interest thereon from the 1st day of July,
1895, until paid, in which sum was embraced a credit to Baker
of the items claimed by him in his action at law against Cummings. From this final decree an appeal was taken to the
Court of Appeals for the District, by which it was affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE WH=TE, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

Before approaching a discussion of the issues which we
deem it necessary to pass upon in order to conclude the controversy which the record presents, it will subserve the purpose of clearness of statement to give a brief outline of the
proof as to matters about which there is no substantial controversy and to point to the controverted question, thus eliminating from view irrelevant contentions, and concentrating
the attention on the material issues.
1. The existence of the partnership was established as
alleged, and the fact that the claims of the inspectors had
been unearthed by Baker, and had been mainly secured by
him for the firm on a contingent fee of twenty-five per cent,
and had been almost exclusively prosecuted by him, was established beyond question. That Cummings had not given any
great attention to the business for several years, and that
Baker was dissatisfied therewith and had threatened to disvoL. cLx=x-13

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

solve the partnership many months before September, 1886,
though not explicitly admitted by Cummings, was also conclusively established.
2. The sale of Cummings's interest in the inspector fees,
both earned and unearned, for a consideration which embraced
a cash payment of $15,000, was also established beyond dispute. That in the negotiations which preceded the sale Cummings contemplated something besides a mere division between
himself and Baker in equal proportions of the rights of each
in and to the fees, was also indisputably proven. This is testified to by Cummings himself as follows:
"I said, Mr. Baker, I make you this proposition: I will
take one half fees in all the cases in which we have powers of
attorney and contracts prior to the 1st of January, 1886, or I
will take one third of all the fees in all the cases (leaving him
-two thirds), or I will take $15,000, as you offer, according to
what you think is the best for me."'
Undoubtedly, also, the proof establishes that when the sale
was made the fees for cases allowed and appropriated for, then
undivided, amounted to about $32,000, and that the claims
subsequently allowed and appropriated for largely exceeded
$80,000. From these conceded facts there arises a grave contention; Cummings claiming that, as he was entitled to an
equal share of the fees, he was led, by the misrepresentations
of Baker, into making a seeming sale of his interest, receiving
as a consideration virtually nothing but his own money; Baker,
on the other hand, contending that the transaction between
the parties did not contemplate a mere division of their interest, but a sale by Cummings of his rights on the basis of his
being entitled only to a one-third interest in the fees, in order
to obtain a continuance of the partnership as to other matters,
and that the sum of $15,000 and the right of Cummings to
retain the assignee's fees before referred to, was fixed by
Cummings, from his knowledge of the business and his investigations made at the time, as a fair equivalent for his
agreed one-third right as above stated.
3. Nor does any real dispute exist as to the fact that when
the active negotiations for the sale begun, papers were handed

BAKER v. CUAMNGS.
Opinion of the Court.

Cummings by Baker, from which an understanding of the
state of the whole business could have been derived; that
these papers were taken home by Cummings and retained for
several weeks until just before the sale was consummated.
Whilst as to these facts there is no conflict in the proof, there
is a controversy as to whether it was established that Cummings examined the papers carefully so as to put himself in
possession of the information which might have been obtained
from them; Cummings claiming that the papers were of such
a confused nature that he could have arrived at an accurate
knowledge only by inquiry, labor and investigation, which he
did not make, as he preferred to rely upon Baker's special
acquaintance with the status of the claims. Baker, on the
other hand, claiming that he had no greater information than
was accessible to Cummings, and that the latter dealt on the
faith of his own knowledge and estimate, and not upon information derived from or representations made by Baker personally.
4. The proof also establishes, aid theie is no contention on
the subject, that on the evening of 'the sale or the morning of
the day following, Baker left .the city of Washington for the
State of New Hampshire; that he left Cummings in the office,
and before going placed in his hands a document known in
the record as Exhibit H. M. B., No. 3, to enable Cummings to
look after any matters in the inspector cases which might
require attention during his (Baker's) absence; that at the
same time Baker left with Cummings the bank deposit book
of Baker, with his check book containing signed and unfilled
checks to be used as occasion required in the making of remittances or payments in the inspector cases; that Cummings
acted upon this authority and made deposits of drafts collected from the Government, drew checks for amounts due
claimants, and made entries indicating these latter facts upon
the schedule in question; that at the time of Baker's departure
Cummings had not cashed the check given him by Baker as
the consideration for the sale, and that Cummings cancelled
it, and on different occasions filled up three of the signed
checks left by Baker, for the sum of $5000 each, and collected

OCTOBER TERf, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

the same, thus acquiring the consideration referred to. The
proof further established that Baker remained absent for
nearly a mouth, and on his return found Cummings in the
office as usual; that they continued thereafter to occupy the
same office, and that no complaint was made by Cummings
as to the fairness of the sale until nearly three years thereafter, at which time Baker was pressing a claim against Cummings, and had told him that he was going to dissolve the
partnership.
The controverted issue arising from the foregoing unquestioned facts is this: Cummings claims that he did not derive
knowledge of the fraud he complains of from the matters just
stated; whilst Baker asserts that if the fraud in the purchase
complained of by Cummings had existed, full knowledge
thereof was conveyed to Cummings by the facts above stated,
and that the silence of the latter and his inaction for years,
and until Baker had made claim for money and stated his
intention to dissolve partnership, not only establishes the want
of foundation for Cummings's assertion that there was misrepresentation and fraud in the sale, but also makes clear the
fact that the right to make such claim was barred, both by
limitations and laches, when the demand of Cummings was
actually preferred.
It results from the foregoing that the facts as to the controverted matters are embraced in a narrow compass, and
that the whole case really resolves itself into two issues: 1st.
Does the proof establish that the purchase and sale in question was as claimed by Cummings, or as asserted by Baker?
In that question is necessarily embraced the further one of
whether Cummings, at the time of the sale, had actual knowledge of the fraudulent representations claimed to have been
made by Baker. This is, in terms, included, because it would
be impossible in reason to declare that one had been deluded
or deceived by misrepresentations into entering into a contract
if he had actual knowledge when the contract was made that
the alleged inducing representations were false. 2d. Conceding that Cummings was misled by the fraudulent representations of Baker as alleged, did he immediately after the

BAKER v. CUMMINGS.
Opinion of the Court.

sale, and before the collection by him of the cash consideration of the sale, discover that the representations were untrue,
and thereby become aware that he had been grossly deceived
and defrauded, and did he, with such knowledge, say nothing
about the matter, collect the cash consideration, remain silent,
and continue in partnership with Baker, occupying the same
office for years, and only assert that he had been deceived
when a dissolution of the partnership was threatened and he
was pressed to pay a sum which Baker claimed Cummings
owed him? This latter inquiry assumes a twofold aspect, for
although in the bill, in the opinions below, and in the argument at bar, the efficient misrepresentation, which it is asserted
rendered the assignment void, was the fraudulent statement
as to the sum of the fees on the claims then allowed and appropriated for, nevertheless it is also, as we have seen, asserted
in the bill and contended in argument that there was a misrepresentation as to the pending claims not yet acted upon
by the department, and which were then unappropriated for
by Congress.
We will defer an examination of the testimony as to the
existence of the fraud and misrepresentation complained of
until we have passed on the charge that, if there was fraud
and misrepresentation, Cummings had full knowledge thereof
immediately after the sale. We adopt this order of consideration because if it be found that such was the case, the question
whether the fraud originally existed will become immaterial,
in view of the defences of limitation and laches. Moreover,
in reviewing the question of knowledge, we will do so in the
order stated, that is, first, discovery of the alleged fraud and
misrepresentation as to the amount of fees collected and in
process of collection from claims appropriated for at the time
of the sale; and, second, discovery of the misrepresentation
as to the amount of pending claims from which further fees
were expected. Iere, also, it is to be premised that if the
first proposition be found to be well taken, an examination of
the second will be wholly unnecessary. This, obviously, is
the case, for as the statute of limitations began to run from the
time when suit might have been brought to annul the sale, it

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

results that the discovery of the falsity of any material and
fraudulent representation by which the sale had been induced,
gave rise to the right to commence an action to rescind, and
therefore fixed the period when the statute of limitations
commenced its course.
I. -- Did the schedules left with Cummings the day after the
sale, when Baker went off to New H7ampshire, and which remained in the custody of Cummings and were practically
under his control, convey to Cummings full knowledge that he
had been grossly deceived as to the amount of fees collected, as
alleged by him, if his statement that such false representation
had been made was true, and did he remain silent for three
years thereafter?
In entering upon an analysis of the evidence upon this
particular subject, we shall be governed by the principle determined by this court in numerous cases -of which Stuart
v. Hayden, 169 U. S. 1, decided at the present term, is the
last expression - that when two courts have reached the same
conclusion on a question of fact, their finding will not be disturbed unless it be clear that their conclusion was erroneous.
To determine whether Cummings knew immediately after
the sale, and before he had collected the price thereof, whether
misrepresentations had been made to him and fraud practised
upon him as to fees from cases then appropriated for, it is, of
course, essential to see clearly what were the misrepresentations asserted to have been made, and what was the fraud
claimed to have been perpetrated. They were, as alleged in
the bill, that Baker, with a knowledge that the fees from the
claims allowed and appropriated for were $32,000, had concealed the fact from Cummings, and represented that such fees
were only equal to $20,000 or thereabouts. It is obvious then
that the fraudulent representation alleged was not as to the
amount of the claims allowed and appropriated for upon which
the fee of twenty-five per cent was to be calculated, but as to
the sum of the fees to arise from the calculation. And this is
unmistakably established by the testimony of Cummings in
his examination on the 29th of February, 1892, where he said,
in describing the representation made by Baker to him:

BAKER v. CUMMINGS.
Opinion of the Court.

".I asked Mr. Baker how many fees there were that were,
due us in cases that had been adjudicated and for which appropriation had been made, and which were then in the process of collection, and he said about $20,000, or not more than
$22,000. I was somewhat surprised at that, and I so expressed
my surprise to him; he said that our fees in some of those
cases were not as much as usual; some only about 10, 15 or
20 per cent."
It is not reasonable to infer that surprise could have arisen
as to the amount of fees if there had been no antecedent
knowledge of the sum of the claims on which the fees were to
be calculated. The fact that Cummings had approximate
general knowledge of the amount of the claims is not only
shown by the particular statement just cited, but by his declaration that he observed when appropriations were made,
knew at the time that the appropriation of August, 1886, had
been made, and also knew that practically all of the inspector
cases were controlled by his firm. As all the fees earned
which were embraced in the sale arose from claims covered by
the appropriation made in August, 1886, it follows that these
statements by Cummings and his admitted knowledge of the
August appropriation taken together leave no doubt that
Cummings was fully informed as to the sum of the claims
from which the earned fees arose. Indeed, the possibility of
any other view of the testimony is removed by a statement of
Cummings subsequentlymade, and to which we shall hereafter
more fully refer, in which he plainly says that he knew that
the gross amount coming in on the basis of the usual compensation was $32,000, and supposed that the reduced amount
arose from charges against it.
Now, then, the issue of fact to be determined is this: Could
it have been possible for Cummings to have received the
schedule in question on the morning after the sale, to have
dealt with it, to have made entries on it at various times,
without being informed that the fees of the firm were not less
than 25 per cent in a sufficient number of cases to have justified any belief whatever that the sum of the fees was reduced
from $32,000 to $20,000? The schedule left in his hands by

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

Baker contained seven sheets. In one column was the name of
the claimant, in another the total allowance, in a third the fee,
in a fourth the amount of the remittance to the claimant, in a
fifth the date of the remittance, in a sixth whether remitted by
check, in a seventh the number of the check, and in an eighth
column the date of the check. The amount of the aggregate
fees appearing on each sheet was added up and stated at the
bottom of the column. With such total stated, the only act
required to ascertain the aggregate amount of all the fees was
to sum the footing of the sheets. And yet the want of knowledge by Cummings of the fraud is predicated upon the proposition that although these sheets were in his bands for nearly a
month, while he was dealing with them making entries on
them, he was so careless as never even to make the addition
which would have conveyed to him absolute knowledge of the
fact that the fraud had been committed. But even the addition
was not necessary, for if the fraudulent misrepresentation was
made, it was not, as we have seen, as to the gross amount, but
as to the net fees to be realized from the gross amount, that
is, that the diminished amount arose from the fact that in the
cases on the schedule the firm was getting less than 25 per
cent. But on the sheets, in the column of fees immediately
next to the column of amount allowed, the sum of the fee
in each case was stated, and no eye could even casually look
at the schedule without observing that nearly all the fees were
stated therein at the rate of 25 per cqnt, and not at a diminished rate. However, to hold that Cummings did not derive
knowledge from the schedule, the reasoning must go yet
further. Out of 106 names on the schedule, there were only
five where the fees stated were less than 25 per cent, and in
four of these five cases the fact that the fee was a reduced percentage was made evident by the statement expressed in
figures immediately opposite the name of the claimant, giving
the exact percentage upon which the fee was calculated. The
mind, then, is driven to the conclusion that the testimony
beyond doubt establishes that Cummings knew immediately
after the sale and before he collected the price that Baker
had made to him a gross and wilful misrepresentation, if the

BAKER v. CUMMI NGS.
Opinion of the Court.

statement was made by Baker to which Cummings testifies,
and which he asserts operated to induce him to part with his
interest.
Overwhelming as is the proof that the schedule conveyed
to Cummings the knowledge of the fraud if it had been perpetrated, such fact is unquestionably shown by Cummings's
further testimony. At a subsequent stage of his examination
*when he was questioned on the subject and his possession of
the schedule had been developed, he frankly admitted that
his possession of the schedule and his dealings with it had
informed him that Baker's representation which he swore had
been made about the diminished percentage was untrue, but
that he had on such discovery lulled himself into security by
the belief that there must have been another reason for
Baker's statement of the reduction in the amount of fees, that
is, the large sums which Baker might have had to pay out to
other attorneys, and presumably under this belief he remained
silent. We extract a question and answer bearing on this
subject:
"Q. Now, then, iour check was paid in that way. When
did you first obtain any knowledge as to the amount of claims
which had been collected by Baker upon the first class of
cases -I allude to the class of cases in which he said there
were from $20,000 to $22,000 in fees, the cases in which appropriation had already been made; and you may also state
at the same time when you first discovered in regard to the
other class of cases in which no appropriation had been made
-- when you first discovered the amount ?
"A. The amount of the claims that had been adjudicated
and which were in the process of collection I discovered, of
course, within a day or two after Mir. Baker had delivered me
the schedules, and I continued the collections, because these
schedules contained the name, the amount, the fee and all the
data pertaining to each case, and it was hard for me to reconcile the amount of fees that he said and the amount of fees
that were on the schedule, and I know often we had to pay
out a large amount of our fees to other attorneys, as I frequently had paid one half of a fee to a local attorney to work

OCTOBER TERM-, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

up the evidence, and I had supposed the great diminution of
these fees from what I supposed, viz., $32,000, in the vicinity
of $30,000, was owing to the division with other lawyers. It
has been my habit in a number of cases -I write down my
ideas of things, and on that occasion I sat down and I made a
private memorandum for myself, giving my impressions of
the matter, wondering as to whether I had done the best or
not and wondering if the facts were-"
However unreasonable may be this explanation, and however natural is the inference that, if Cummings had discovered
that his partner had made a gross misstatement to him and
defrauded him, he would not have completed the sale by collecting the consideration, but would have called his attention
to the facts when the partner returned a month after, need
not be discussed since the reason given by Cummings for his
conduct is rendered wholly nugatory by another consideration,
which is this: The seventh of the sheets left in the custody of
Cummings contained a statement of the sums to be paid to
other attorneys by the firm on the claims mentioned in the
schedule. The form of this sheet was slightly different from
that of the others. It showed the name of the attorney to
whom the fee was due, in the next column in what case the
fee was due, in the third column the date of the remittance of
the fee, in the fourth column whether remitted by check, and
in the fifth the date of the check. Now, if, as demonstrated
by the proof and as admitted by Cummings himself in his
second statement, his dealings with and relations to the schedule conveyed to him knowledge that there was no truth in
Baker's supposed representation as to reduced percentages
coining to the firm, how in reason can it be denied that knowledge that the amount could not have been materially reduced
by fees paid to other attorneys must have also been conveyed
to him when the schedule plainly showed the fact as to the
amounts to be paid other attorneys and that they aggregated
less than $1500. Indeed, it is justly to be inferred from the
testimony that, as the facts shown by the schedule were developed and Cummings's memory was refreshed by the examination thereof, his mental condition changed, and he reached the

BAKER v. CUMMINGS.
Opinion of the Court.

conclusion that he had been previously mistaken in saying
that, although the schedule had informed him of the amount,
he had been lulled into security, since he subsequently swore
that the schedules ga'ye him no information whatever, because
he did not look at them at all. His statement to this effect is
as follows:
"When Mr. Baker handed me that paper and called my
attention to the fact that all had' not been collected, and that
quite a number of payments were still to be made, I simply
put it in my desk; I paid no attention to it, because I considered the trade was made. I had nothing to do with it, but
simply took that paper, and when a power of attorney would
come in with power to cash the draft I would make the proper
entry, but it never came into my head -that there was anything wrong about it. I considered that I had sold out to Mr.
Baker for a fair consideration. I had no idea that I was being
paid with my own money."
So, also, on cross-examination in rebuttal, the following
question was asked and answer given by complainant:
"Q. Mr. Cummings, you have stated that Exhibit H. 21. B.,
No. 3, (the schedule we have been referring to,) in answer to
a question by Mr. Claughton, was in your possession, and that
you paid no attention to it and put it aside. You did not take
enough interest in it to go over it and see what it was ?
"A. The transaction was closed, as I supposed."
Again, after being cross-examined at some length and being
called upon to explain his delay in instituting the present proceedings, and after he had stated that in 1886 he knew of the
fact of the appropriation in August of that year by Congress,
he was asked to state if he had discovered any facts in 1888
in relation to the appropriation of 1886 which he did not have
in 1886. The reply was:
"A. I knew no more about the standing of the appropriations of 1886 for these cases and of the settlements thereunder
for two years after those settlements were made; in other
words, I had no knowledge of the appropriation of 1886 until
my suspicions were aroused in 1888. 1 .supposed it was all
fair and square.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

"I don't know that I learned anything in 1888 of consequence about the appropriation of 1886, but it was only when
the three appropriations, amounting to about $240,000 in 1888,
instead of the $80,000 as was represented to me, that I began to
inquire into the matter, and my knowledge of the appropriation of 1886 and of the fees thereunder was gained by taking
the appropriation of 1886 and going into the First Auditor's
Office and seeing what drafts were delivered to Mr. Baker or
Cummings, or Cummings and Baker, under the appropriation
of 1886. When I had gotten the list of those drafts I got the
correct amount of them.
"I think it was in the fall or winter of 1888 or 1889 when I
got the list. I did not get a list; I made a list and I went
back to my office and I took the Treasury executive document
containing the allowances of those cases, and I estimated, as
far as I could, and I believe that I am correct, that Mr. Baker
received $135,000 on the claims of 1886.
"I don't remember now that I knew anything about the appropriation of 1886, intervening between 1886 and 1888, though
I may have done so, but I do not remember it."
But the "list" referred to did not give him as much information as was contained in the schedule which was handed to
him immediately after the sale, and which he had in his sole
custody for more than three weeks. Nor can the statement
of the witness that the schedule was not looked at, overcome
the inherent probabilities as to the knowledge which must
have been conveyed, in view of their contents, of the length
of time they were in Cummings's possession, of his entries
thereon and dealings therewith, and, above all, his previous
sworn statement. In other words, the last statement that
knowledge was not conveyed by the schedule cannot be taken
as true without repudiating the previous declaration that the
schedule had given the knowledge, but that its so doing did
not excite suspicion, for a reason which the schedules themselves show could not have existed.
From the record we infer that this result must have produced an impression on the mind of Cummings, for, later on in
his examination, when his attention was called to the fact that

if he had been deceived by Baker as to the sum of the fees
when the sale was made, he could not have escaped discovering it when the schedules were handed him after the sale,
he again changed his position and declared that he did not
then take any action because the discovery of the misrepresentation as to the amount of the fees earned had not excited his
suspicions, because of the immateriality of such misrepresentations.
"A. I am not going to give ideas, but simply facts. My
whole idea as to whether I had made a poor trade or not
had nothing to do with the amount of fees received in 1886,
but solely and entirely on account of the future business that
would come in; when Mr. Baker had told me that there was
only $75,000 or $80,000 more of cases, out of which there
would be a possible $20,000 of fees, I did not know whether
that was correct or not, and, as I stated, I could not tell, but
time alone would tell."
The situation, then, is this : Looking at the case, as made
by the testimony of Cummings, it is impossible to avoid reaching two conclusions; 1st, that Cummings knew the exact condition of the earned fees shortly after the sale, and knew also
that he had been grossly deceived if his statement of the transaction was the true one, and that with this full information
he collected the price of the sale and remained quiescent for
three years without complaining and without attempting to
have the wrong rectified; 2d, that this conduct on his part is
first attributed to one cause, and then to another and conflicting one. When both of these explanations are shown by the
proof to be untrue, then the matter is finally explained by
him by the statement that on the discovery of the facts he so
acted, because he attached no importance whatever to the
amount of the fees earned at the time of the sale, and considered that he had not been defrauded by the untrue representations which he asserted had been made in reference
thereto. But the bill of complaint, as we have seen, proceeds,
and the judgments below rested, upon the theory that the representation as to the amount of the earned fees at the time of the
sale was the most material ground for rescinding the contract.

OCTOBEIR TERMI, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

Our conclusion is, that the evidence not only clearly but
beyond all question or dispute overwhelmingly shows that if
the false representations as to the earned fees were made as
alleged, there was entire knowledge thereof by Cummings.
And, for reasons heretofore stated, this conclusion renders
unnecessary any inquiry into the question of when Cummings
discovered the falsity of the alleged representations as to the
amount of pending claims.
The question which arises is: Can Cummings invoke the
aid of a court of equity to afford him the relief which he
seeks? A negative answer is compelled by a consideration of
the most elementary principles.
As said in .Xetropolitav National Bank v. St. Louis Dis.atch Co., 149 U. S. 436, 448: "Courts of equity, in cases of
concurrent jurisdiction, consider themselves bound by the
statutes of limitation which govern actions at law." That
Cummings might at his election have pursued a remedy for the
alleged fraud in a court of law is obvious. And it is equally
clear that such remedy at law, by action on the case predicated
on the facts as to deceit and fraud, whiGh are alleged in the
bill now before us, would have been barred in three years
from the discovery of the fraud under the Statutes of Limitation of Maryland of 1715, c. 23, § 2, in force in the District of
Columbia. 1 Kilty's Statutes, 111 ; Comp. Laws Dist. Col., c.
42, § 6, p. 360. It hence follows, irrespective of the equitable
doctrine of laches, that the relief which the bill seeks to obtain ought not to be allowed by a court of equity.
Apart, however, from the bar of the statute of limitations,
the facts as to the full knowledge of the fraud, if any existed,
by Cummings more than three years before the filing'of his
bill, and his conduct after he obtained it, his permitting Baker
to go on and prosecute the claims as if they were his own, debars Cummings from invoking a court of conscience to put him
in a much better position than he could possibly have occupied
if he had spoken and asserted his rights in due season.
There cannot be a doubt that the right existed in Baker to
have dissolved the partnership at any time. If this right on
his part had been exercised, Cummings would not have been

BAKER v. CUMMINGS.
Opinion of the Court.

in a position to have availed himself of the labors of Baker in
prosecuting the future claims to a successful culmination, and
would not therefore have been a participant in the profits arising therefrom. If with a full knowledge of the fraud Cummings chose to remain silent, to permit Baker to go on with
the prosecution of the claims, to incur the expenditure of time
and labor not only in the cases in which he was successful but
in the cases in which he failed, Cummings cannot in conscience
be allowed to reap the rewards which he could not possibly
have obtained had he spoken with reasonable promptness,
when the knowledge of the fraud if it existed was brought
home to him in the most pointed and unequivocal way.
These broad considerations of equity and justice were not
applied below because it was deemed that the occasion for
their enforcement had not arisen, for two reasons: First, because it was thought that even if Cummings discovered the
fraud in ample time to have availed himself of his rights, he
was lulled into not doing so by his faith and confidence in
Baker and his disinclination to believe that Baker had perpetrated so gross a fraud fipon him. Second, because it was
said as Cummings's share of the earned fees, upon the theory
of a half and half division, was equal to the price which he
received, there was no consideration for the sale, and the
transaction was wholly void, hence there was no room for the
application either of the statute of limitations or the doctrine
of laches. In other words, that the partnership continued
as to the inspector claims just as if no sale had been made.
And the doctrine was carried to its logical outcome, since the
judgmbnt below awarded to Cummings a share in the fees
earned by Baker, from contracts not under the control of the
firm at the time of the sale of the interest in the inspector
cases, but which were acquired by Baker thereafter.
But neither of these views meets our approbation. The
first is completely answered by the fact that the analysis of
the evidence which we have made conclusively establishes
that if the fraud was perpetrated as alleged, the fullest
knowledge was conveyed to Cummings more than three years
before he brought his suit. Under this state of facts the

reasoning comes then to this, that there is no doctrine, either
of limitation or of laches, applicable to a case of alleged fraud
even although the party obtains almost at once full knowledge
thereof, if he choose without due reason to affirm that he did
not act because he was unwilling to believe his own senses.
Reduced to its ultimate deduction, the proposition maintains
this doctrine, that if one against whom a fraud has been perpetrated and who thereafter is in all respects fully informed
of its nature and extent, chooses not to act, his so electing
may continue indefinitely, provided only he declares not that
he did not know, but that knowing he did not believe.
The second proposition, conceding arguendo the facts are
as it assumed them to be, that is, that the price was paid
Cummings from his own money, leads in reason to an equally
impossible result, since its consequence is substantially to affirm that neither limitation nor laches can be applied in equity
when from a given view of the proof it is considered that
a fraud has been committed of such a nature as to avoid a
contract. That this is the logical outcome of the proposition
is shown by its application to the case under consideration.
Whether or not Cummings was paid by his. own money depends upon an analysis of the facts and a finding as to their
preponderance. If the theory of Baker be true that the contract contemplated a division between the partners as to the
claims in question, not upon the basis of one half each, but
upon the basis of two thirds to Baker and one third to Cummings, because the claims had been largely realized by the
efforts of Baker, and because, as a consideration for so dividing, Baker agreed as to other business to continue the partnership with Cummings when otherwise he would have
dissolved, there can be no pretence for the claim that Cummings was paid with his own money. To say, then, that
Cummings was paid by his own money necessitates deciding
that the fraud was established as alleged by Cummings. But
the principle by which the bar of the statute of limitations is
enforced by a court of equity and upon which the doctrine of
laches rests is that equitable powers will not be exercised to,
discover whether one has been wronged when, with full

Syllabus.

knowledge of the alleged wrong, he has allowed the bar of
the statute of limitations to arise, and has slept upon his rights
until such a situation has arisen as to render it inequitable to
afford him relief. By the effect of the proposition referred
to these principles are subverted, and a new doctrine arises
which may be thus stated: A court of equity will not grant
relief against fraud where the one against whom the fraud
has been committed has, after its discovery, allowed the bar
of the statute of limitations to be accomplished, unless there
has been fraud, and if there has been such fraud neither laches
nor limitation can ever apply.
Because we rest our conclusions upon the applicatiQn of the
bar of the statute and the laches of Cummings, we must not
be considered as intimating that we conclude that there was
either clear and convincing proof, or even a preponderance of
proof, that the sale was as claimed by Cummings.
It follows that the decree of the Court of Apeals of the
Districtof Columbia must be reversed, and the cause be
remanded to that court, with. directions to set aside the
decree of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia,
and to remand the cause to that court with instructions to
dismiss the bill, and it is so ordered.
