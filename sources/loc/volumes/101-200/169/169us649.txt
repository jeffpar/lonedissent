UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM AR K.
Statement of the Case.

'UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
APPEAL FROM THE

DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES

FOR

THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 182. Argued March 5, 8, 189T.-Decided March 28, 1898.

A child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the
time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and are there carrying
on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity
under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen
of the United States, by virtue of the first clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution, "All persons born or naturalized in the
United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of
the United States and of the State wherein they reside."

Tins was a writ of habeas corp2us, issued October 2, 1895, by
the District Court of the United States for the Northern
District of California, to the collector of customs at the port
of San Francisco, in behalf of Wong Kim Ark, who alleged
that he was a citizen of the United States, of more than
twenty-one years of age, and was born at San Francisco in
1873 of parents of Chinese descent and subjects of the Emperor
of China, but domiciled residents at San Francisco; and that,
on his return to the United States on the steamship Coptic in
August, 1895, from a temporary visit to China, he applied to
said collector of customs for permission to land, and was by
the collector refused such permission, and was restrained of
his liberty by the collector, and by the general manager of
the steamship company acting under his direction, in violation
of the Constitution and laws of the United States, not by
virtue of any judicial order or proceeding, but solely upon the
pretence that he was not a citizen of the United States.
At the hearing, the District Attorney of the United States
was permitted to intervene in behalf of the United States in
opposition to the writ, and stated the grounds of his intervention in writing as follows:
"That, as he is informed and believes, the said person in

whose behalf said application was made is not entitled to land
in the United States, or to be or remain therein, as is alleged
in said application, or otherwise.
"Because the said Wong Kim Ark, although born in the
city and county of San Francisco, State of California, United
States of America, is not, under the laws of the State of California and of the United States, a citizen thereof, the mother
and father of the said Wong Kim Ark being Chinese persons
and subjects of the Emperor of China, and the said Wong
Kim Ark being also a Chinese person and a subject of the
Emperor of China.
"Because the said Wong Kim Ark has been at all times,
by reason of his race, language, color and dress, a Chinese
person, and now is, and for some time last past has been, a
laborer by occupation.
"That the said Wong Kim Ark is not entitled to land in
the United States, or to be or remain therein, because he does
not belong to any of the privileged classes enumerated in any
of the acts of Congress, known as the Chinese Exclusion Acts,I
which would exempt him from the class or classes which are
especially excluded from the United States by the provisions
of the said acts.
"Wherefore the said United States Attorney asks that a
judgment and order of this honorable court be made and
entered in accordance with the allegations herein contained,
and that the said Wong Kim Ark be detained on board of
said vessel until released as provided by law, or otherwise to
be returned to the country from whence he came, and that
such further order be made "as to the court may seem proper
and legal in the premises."
The case was submitted to the decision of the court upon
the following facts agreed by the parties:
"That the said Wong Kim Ark was born in the year 1873,
at No. 751 Sacramento Street, in the city and county of. San
Francisco, State of California, United States of America, and

and subjects of the Emperor of China, and that said Wong

"That at the time of his said birth his mother and father
were domiciled residents of the United States, and had established and enjoyed a permanent domicil and residence therein
at said city and county of San Francisco, State aforesaid.
"That said mother and father of said Wong Kim Ark continued to reside and remain in the United States until the
year 1890, when they departed for China.
"That during all the time of their said residence in the
United States as domiciled residents therein the said mother
and father of said Wong Kim Ark were engaged in the prosecution of business, and were never engaged in any diplomatic
or official capacity under the Emperor of China.
"That ever since the birth of said Wong Kim Ark, at the
time and place hereinbefore stated and stipulated, he has had
but one residence, to wit, a residence in said State of California, in the United States of America, and that he has
never changed or lost said residence or gained or acquired
another residence, and there resided claiming to be a citizen
of the United States.
"That in the year. 1890 the said Wong Kim Ark departed
for China upon a temporary visit and with the intention of
returning to the United States, and did return thereto on
July 26, 1890, on the steamship Gmlic, and was permitted
to enter the United States by the collector of customs upon
the sole ground that he was a native-born citizen of the
United States.
"That after his said return the said Wong Kim Ark remained in the United States, claiming to be a citizen thereof,
until the year 189-, when he again departed for China upon
a temporary visit, and with the intention of returning to the
United States, and did return thereto in the month of August,
1895, and applied to the collector of customs to be permitted
to land; and that such application was denied upon the sole
ground that said Wong Kim Ark was not a citizen of the
United States.

Opinion of the Court.

"That said Wong Kim Ark has not, either by himself or

.MXr. Thomas D. Riordanfiled a brief for same.
MR. JUsTIcE GRAY, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.

The facts of this case, as agreed by the parties, are as follows: Wong Kim Ark was born in 1873 in the city of San
Francisco, in the State of California and United States of
America, and was and is a laborer. His father and mother
were persons of Chinese descent, and subjects of the Emperor
of China; they were at the time of his birth domiciled residents of the United States, having previously established and
still enjoying a permanent domicil and residence therein at
San Francisco; they continued to reside and remain in the
United States until 1890, when they departed for China; and
during all the time of their residence in the United States
they were engaged in business, and were never employed in any
diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China.
Wong Kim Ark, ever since his birth, has had but one residence, to wit, in California, within the United States, and has
there resided, claiming to be a citizen of the United States,
and has never lost or changed that residence, or gained or
acquired another residence; and neither he, nor his parents
acting for him, ever renounced his allegiance to the United
States, or did or committed any act or thing to exclude him

Opinion of the Court.

therefrom. In 1890 (when he must have been about seventeen
years of age) he departed for China on a temporary visit and
with the intention of returning to the United States, and did
return thereto by sea in the same year, and was permitted by
the collector of customs to enter the United States, upon the
sole ground that he was a native-born citizen of the United
States. After such return, he remained in the United States,
claiming to be a citizen thereof, until 1894, when he (being
about twenty-one years of age, but whether a little above or
a little under that age does not appear) again departed for
China on a temporary visit and with the intention of returning to the United States; and he did return thereto by sea in
August, 1895, and applied to the collector of customs for permission to land; and was denied such permission, upon the
sole ground that he was not a citizen of the United States.
It is conceded that, if he is a citizen of the United States,
the acts of Congress, known as the Chinese Exclusion Acts,
prohibiting persons of the Chinese race, and especially Chinese
laborers, from coming into the United States, do not and cannot apply to him.
The question presented by the record is whether a child born
in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at
the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China,
but have a permanent domicil and residence in the United
States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of
the United States, by virtue of the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, "All persons born or
naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State
wherein they reside."
I. In construing any act of legislation, whether a statute
enacted by the legislature, or a constitution established by the
people as the supreme law of the land, regard is to be had,
not only to all parts of the act itself, and of any former act of
the same law-making power, of which the act in question is
an amendment; but also to the condition, and to the history,

654

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

of the law as previously existing, and in the light of which
the new act must be read and interpreted.
The Constitution of the United States, as originally adopted,
uses the words "citizen of the United States," and "naturalborn citizeh of the United States." By the original Constitu,
tion, every representative in Congress is required to have been
"seven years a citizen of the United States," and every Senator to have been " nine years a citizen of the United States, "
and "no person except a natural-born citizen, or a citizen of
the United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President." The
Fourteenth Article of Amendment, besides declaring that "all
persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject
to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States
and of the State wherein they reside," also declares that "no
State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor
shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property,
without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." And the Fifteenth Article of Amendment declares that "the right of
citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States, or by any State, on account of
race, color or previous condition of servitude."
The Constitution nowhere defines the meaning of these
words, either by way of inclusion or of exclusion, except in so
far as this is done by the affirmative declaration that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States."
In this, as in other respects, it must be interpreted in the light
of the common law, the principles and history of which were
familiarly known to the framers of the Constitution. .Minor
v. -Happersett,21 Wall. 162; Ex parte I'lson, 114 U. S. 417,
422; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S.616, 624, 625; Smith v.
Alabama,124 U. S. 465. The language of the Constitution,
as has been well said, could not be understood without reference to the common law. 1 Kent Com. 336; Bradley, J., in
foore v. United States, 91 U. S. 270, 274.

UMITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

In Minor v. Hapyersett, Chief Justice Waite, when construing, in behalf of the court, the very provision of the Fourteenth
Amendment now in question, said: "The Constitution does
not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens. Resort
must be had elsewhere to ascertain that." And he proceeded
to resort to the common law as an aid in the construction of
this provision. 21 Wall. 161.
In Smith v. Alabama, Mr. Justice Matthews, delivering the
judgment of the court, said: "There is no common law of the
United States, in the sense of a national customary law, distinct from the common law of England as adopted by the
several States each for itself, applied as its local law, and subject to such alteration as may be provided by its own statutes."
"There is, however, one clear exception to the statement that
there is no national common law. The interpretation of the
Constitution of the United States is necessarily influenced by
the fact that its provisions are framed in the language of the
English common law, and are to be read in the light of its history." 124: U. S. 478.
II. The fundamental principle of the common law with regard to English nationality was birth" within the allegiance,
faith" or "power," of
also called "ligealty," "obedience,"
the King. The principle embraced all persons born within
the King's allegiance and subject to his protection. Such allegiance and protection were mutual-as expressed in the
maxim,p~roteetio trahit subjectionem, et subjectio protectionem
- and were not restricted to natural-born subjects and naturalized subjects, or to those who had taken an oath of allegiance; but were predicable of aliens in amity, so long as they
were within the kingdom. Children, born in England, of such
aliens, were therefore natural-born subjects. But the children,
born within the realm, of foreign ambassadors, or the children
of alien enemies, born during and within their hostile occupation of part of the King's dominions, were not natural-born
subjects, because not born within the allegiance, the obedience,
or the power, or, as would be said at this day, within the jurisdiction of the King.
This fundamental principle, with these qualifications or

explanations of it, was clearly, though quaintly, stated in the
leading case, known as Calvin's Case, or the Case of the Postnati, decided in 1608, after a hearing in the Exchequer
Chamber before the Lord Chancellor and all the Judges of
England, and reported by Lord Coke and by Lord Ellesmere.

639, 640, 659, 679.
The English authorities ever since are to the like effect.

pp. 173-177, 741.
In Udny v. Ucdny, (1869) L. R. 1 H. L. Sc. 441, the point
decided was one of inheritance, depending upon the question
whether the domicil of the father was in England or in Scotland, he being in either alternative a British subject. Lord
Chancellor Hatherley said: "The question of naturalization
and of allegiance is distinct from that of domicil." p. 452.
Lord Westbury, in the passage relied on by the counsel for
the United States, began by saying: "The law of England,
and of almost all civilized countries, ascribes to each individual at his birth t~vo distinct legal states or conditions: one,
by virtue of which he becomes the subject of some particular
country, binding him by the tie of natural allegiance, and
which may be called his political status; another, by virtue of
which he has ascribed to him the character of a citizen of some
particular country, and as such is possessed of certain municipal rights, and subject to certain obligations, which latter
character is the civil status or condition of the individual, and
may be quite different from his political status." And then,
while maintaining that the civil status is universally governed
by the single principle of domicil, domicilium, the criterion
established by international law for the purpose of determining civil status, and the basis on which "the personal rights
of the party, that is to say, the law which determines his
majority or minority, his marriage, succession, testacy or in-

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

testacy, must depend;" he yet distinctly recognized that a
man's political status, his country, patria,and his "nationality,
that is, natural allegiance," " may depend on different laws in
different countries." pp. 457, 460. He evidently used the
word "citizen," not as equivalent to "subject," but rather to
"inhabitant;" and had no thought of impeaching the established rule that all persons born under, British dominion are
natural-born subjects.
Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, in the same year, reviewing
the whole matter, said: "By the common law of England,
every person born within the dominions of the Crown, no
matter whether of English or of foreign parents, and, in the
latter case, whether the parents were. settled, or merely temporarily sojourning, in the country, was an English subject;
save only the children of foreign ambassadors (who were
excepted because their fathers carried their own nationality
with them), or a child born to a foreigner during the hostile
occupation of any part of the territories of England. Nlo
effect appears to have been given to descent as a source of
nationality," Cockburn on Nationality, 7.
Mr. Dicey, in his careful and thoughtful Digest of the Law
of England with reference to the Conflict of Laws, published
in 1896, states the following propositions, his principal rules
being printed below in italics: "' 'Britishsubject' means any
person who owes permanent allegiance to the Crown. 'Permanent' allegiance is used to distinguish the allegiance of a
British subject from the allegiance of an alien who, because
he is within the British dominions, owes 'temporary' allegiance to the Crown. 'Yatural-bornBritish subject' means a
British subject who has become a Britishsubject at the moment
of his birth." "Subject to the exceptions hereinafter mentioned,any person who (whatever the nationalityof his parents)
is born within the British dominions is a naturalbornBritish
subject. This rule contaifis the leading principle of English
law on the subject of British nationality." The exceptions
afterwards mentioned by Mr. Dicey are only these two:
"1. Any person who (his father being an alien enemy) is born
in a part of the British dominions, which at the time of such
VOL. cL=Ix--42

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

person's birth is in hostile occupation, is an alien." "2. Any
person whose father (being an alien) is at the time of such
person's birth an ambassador or other diplomatic agent accredited to the Crown by the Sovereign of a foreign State is
(though born within the British dominions) an alien." And
he adds: "The exceptional and unimportant instances in
which birth within the British dominions does not of itself
confer British nationality are due to the fact that, though at
common law nationality or allegiance in substance depended on
the place of a person's birth, it in theory at least depended,
not upon the locality of a man's birth, but upon his being born
within the jurisdiction and allegiance of the King of England;
and it might occasionally happen that a person was born
within the dominions without being born within the allegiance, or, in other words, under the protection and control of
the Crown." Dicey Conflict of Laws, pp. 173-177, 741.
It thus clearly appears that by the law of England for the
last three centuries, beginning before the settlement of this
country, and continuing to the present day, aliens, while residing in the dominions possessed by the Crown of England,
were within the allegiance, the obedience, the faith or loyalty,
the protection, the power, the jurisdiction, of the English Sovereign; and therefore every child born in England of alien
parents was a natural-born subject, unless the child of an
ambassador or other diplomatic agent of a foreign State, or
of an alien enemy in hostile occupation of the place where
the child was born.
III. The same rule was in force in all the English Colonies
upon this continent down to the time of the Declaration of
Independence, and in the United States afterwards, and continued to prevail under the Constitution as originally established.
In the early case of The C/harming Betsy, (1804) it appears
to have been assumed by this court that all persons born in
the United States were citizens of the United States; Chief
Justice Mfarshall saying: "Whether a person born within the
United States, or becoming a citizen according to the established laws of the country, can divest himself absolutely of

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIAI ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

that character otherwise than in such manner as may be
prescribed by law, is a question which it is not necessary at
present to decide." 2 Cranch, 64, 119.
In Inglis v. Sailors' Snug Harrbor,(1830) 3 Pet. 99, in which
the plaintiff was born in the city of New York, about the time
of the Declaration of Independence, the justices of this court
(while differing in opinion upon other points) all agreed that
the law of England as to citizenship by birth was the law
of the English Colonies in America. Mr. Justice Thompson,
speaking for the majority of the court, said: "It is univer
sally admitted, both in the English courts and in those of our
own country, that all persons born within the Colonies of
North America, whilst subject to the Crown of Great Britain,
were natural-born British subjects." 3 Pet. 120. Mr. Justice
Johnson said: "He was entitled to inherit as a citizen born of
the State of New York." 3 Pet. 136. Mr. Justice Story
stated the reasons upon this point more at large, referring- to
Calvin's Case, Blackstone's Commentaries, and -Doe v. Jones,
above cited, and saying: "Allegiance is nothing more than
the tie or duty of obedience of a subject to the sovereign
under whose protection he is; and allegiance by birth is that
which arises from being born within the dominions and under
the protection of a particular sovereign. Two things usually
concur to create citizenship: First, birth locally within the
dominions of the sovereign; and, secondly, birth within the
protection and obedience, or, in other words, within the ligeance of the sovereign. That is, the party must be born
within a place where the sovereign is at the time in full pos
session and exercise of his power, and the party must also at
his birth derive protection from, and consequently owe obedience or allegiance to, the sovereign, as such, defacto. There

are some exceptions which are founded upon peculiar reasons,
and which, indeed, illustrate and confirm the general doctrine:
Thus, a person who is born on the ocean is a subject of the
prince to whom his parents then owe allegiance; for he is
still deemed under the protection of his sovereign, and borii
in a place where he has dominion in common with all other
sovereigns& So the children of an ambassador are held .to be

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

subjects of the prince whom he represents, although born
under the actual protection and in the dominions of a foreign
prince." 3 Pet. 155. -"The children of enemies, born in a
place within the dominions of another sovereign, then occupied by them by conquest, are still aliens." 3 Pet. 156.
"Nothing is better settled at the common law than the doctrine that the children, even of aliens, born in a country,
while the parents are resident there under the protection of
the government, and owing a temporary allegiance thereto,
are subjects by birth." 3 Pet. 164.
In Shanks v. Dupont, 3 Pet. 242, decided (as appears by the
records of this court) on the same day as the last case, it was
held that a woman born in South Carolina before the Declaration of Independence, .married to an English officer in
Charleston during its occupation by the British forces in the
Revolutionary War, and accompanying her husband on his
return to England, and there remaining until her death, was
a British subject, within the meaning of the Treaty of Peace
of 1783, so that her title to land in South Carolina, by descent
cast before that treaty, was protected thereby. It was of such
a case, that Mr. Justice Story, delivering the opinion of the
court, said: "The incapacities of femes covert, provided by
the common law, apply to their civil rights, and are for their
protection and interest. But they do not reach their political
rights, nor prevent their acquiring or losing a national character. Those political rights do not stand upon the mere doctrines of municipal law, applicable to ordinary transactions,
but stand upon the more general principles of the law of
nations." 3 Pet. 248. This last sentence was relied on by
the counsel for the United States, as showing that the question whether a person is a citizen of a particular country is
to be determined, not by the law of that country, but by the
principles of international law. But Mr. Justice Story certainly did not mean to suggest that, independently of treaty,
there was any principle of international law which could defeat the operation of the established rule of citizenship by
birth within the United States; for he referred (p. 245) to the
contemporaneous opinions in Inglis v. Sailors' Snug Harbor,

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

above cited, in which this rule had been distinctly recognized,
and in which he had said (p. 162) that "each government had
a right to decide for itself who should be admitted or deemed
citizens ;" and in his Treatise on the Conflict of Laws, published in 1834, he said that, in respect to residence in different
countries or sovereignties, "there are certain principles which
have been generally recognized, by tribunals administering
public law, [adding, in later editions, "or the law of nations,"]
as of unquestionable authority," and stated, as the first of
those principles, "Persons who are born in a country are
generally deemed citizens and subjects of that country."
Story Conflict of Laws, § 48.
The English statute of 11 & 12 Will. III, (1700) c. 6, entitled
"An act to enable His Majesty's natural-born subjects to inherit the estate of their ancestors, either lineal or collateral,
notwithstanding their father or mother were aliens," enacted
that "all and every person or persons, being the King's
natural-born subject or subjects, within any of the King's
realms or dominions," might and should thereafter lawfully
inherit and make their titles by descent to any lands "from
any of their ancestors, lineal or collateral, although the father
and mother, or father or mother, or other ancestor, of such
person or persons, by, from, through or under whom" title
should be made or derived, bad been or should be " born out of
the King's allegiance, and out of His Majesty's realms and
dominions," as fully and effectually, as if such parents or ancestors "had been naturalized or natural-born subject or subjects within the King's dominions." 7 Statutes of the Realm,
590. It may be observed that, throughout that statute, persons born within the realm, although children of alien parents,
were called" natural-born subjects." As that statute included
persons born "within any of the King's realms or dominions,"
it of course extended to the Colonies, and, not having been
repealed in Maryland, was in force there. In .McCreeryv.
Somerville, (1824) 9 Wheat. 354, which cbncerned the title to
land in the State of Maryland, it was assumed that children
born in that State of an alien who was still living, and who
had not been naturalized, were "native-born citizens of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1S97,
.Opinion of the Court.

,United States ;" and without such assumption the case would
not have presented the question decided by the court, which,

,as stated by Mr. Justice Story in delivering the opinion, was
." whether the statute applies to the case of a living alien ancestor, so as to create a title by heirship, where none would
exist by the common law, if the ancestor were a natural-born
-subject." 9 Wheat. 356.
Again, in .evy v. -tlcCartee, (1832) 6 Pet. 102, 112, 113, 115,
which concerned a descent cast since the American Revolution, in the State of New York, where the statute of 11 & 12
Will. III had been repealed, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice
Story, held that the case must rest for its decision exclusively
upon the principles of the common law; and treated it as
unquestionable that by that law a child born in England of
alien parents was a natural-born subject; quoting the statement of Lord Coke in Co. Lit. 8a, that "if an alien cometh
,into England and hath issue two sons, these, two sons are
'indigence, subjects born, because they are born within the
-realm;" and saying that such a child "was a native-born subject, according to the principles of the common law, stated by
.this court in Me Creery v. Somerville, 9 Wheat. 354."
In Dred Scott v. Sandford, (1857) 19 How. 393, Arr. Justice
Curtis said: "The first section of the second article of the
-Constitution uses the language, 'a natural-born citizen.' It
thus assumes that citizenship may be acquired by birth. Undoubtedly, this language of the Constitution was used in reference -to that principle of public law, well understood in this
country, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, which
referred citizenship to the place of birth." 19 How. 576.
And to this extent no different opinion was expressed or intimated by any of the other judges.
In Un ted States v. Rhodes, (1866) Mr. Justice Swayne, sitting in the Circuit Court, said: "All persons born in the allegiance of the King are natural-born subjects, and all persons
born in the allegiance of the United States are natural-born

of the common law, and it is the common law of this country,
as well as of England." "We find no warrant for the opinion

that this great principle of the common law has ever been
changed in the United States. It has always obtained here
with the same vigor, and subject only to the same exceptions,
since as before the Revolution." 1 Abbott (U. S.) 28, 40, 41.
The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, speaking by
Mr. Justice (afterwards Chief Justice) Sewall, early held that
the determination of the question whether a man was a citizen or an alien was "to be governed altogether by the principles of the common law," and that it was established, with
few exceptions, "that a man, born within the jurisdiction of
the common law, is a citizen of the country wherein he is
born. By this circumstance of his birth, he is subjected to
the duty of allegiance which is claimed and enforced by the
sovereign of his native land; and becomes reciprocally entitled to the protection of that sovereign, and to the other
rights and advantages which are included in the term ' citizenship.'" Gardner v. Ward, (1805) 2 Mass. 244, note. And
again: "The doctrine of the common law is, that every man
born within its jurisdiction is a subject of the sovereign of'the
country where he is born ; and alleogiance is not personal to
the sovereign in the extent that has been contended for; it is
due to him in his political capacity of sovereign of the territory
where the person owing the allegiance was born." Zilhan
v. Ward, (1806) 2 Mass. 236, 265. It may here be observed
that in a recent English case Lord Coleridge expressed the
opinion of the Queen's Bench Division that the statutes of
4 Geo. II, (1731) c. 21, and 13 Geo. III, (1773) c. 21, (hereinafter referred to,) "clearly recognize that to the King in his,
politic, and not in his personal capacity, is the allegiance of his
subjects due." Isaaceso v. Durant,17 Q. B. D, 54, 65.
The Supreme Court of North Carolina, speaking by Mr.
Justice Gaston, said: "Before our Revolution, all free persons
born within the dominions of the King of Great Britain,
whatever their color or complexion, were native-born British
subjects3 those born out of his allegiance were aliens." "Upo n ,
the Revolution, no other change took place in the law of
North Carolina, than was consequent upon the transition from

ereign State;" "British subjects in North Carolina became
North Carolina freemen ;" "and all free persons born within
the State are born citizens of the State." "The term 'citizen,' as understood in our law, is precisely analogous to the
term 'subject' in the common law, and the change of phrase
has entirely resulted from the change of government. The
sovereignty has been transferred from one man to the collective body of the people; and he who before was a 'subject of
the king' is now 'a citizen of the State."' State v. Jfanuel,
(1838) 4 Dev. & Bat. 20, 24-26.
That all children, born within the dominion of the United
States, of foreign parents holding no diplomatic -office, became
citizens at the time of their birth, does not appear to have
been contested or doubted until more than fifty years after
the adoption of the Constitution, when the matter was elaborately argued in the Court of Chancery of New York, and
decided upon full consideration by Vice Chancellor Sandford
in favor of their citizenship. Lynch v. Clarke, (1844) 1 Sandf.
Oh. 583.
The same doctrine was repeatedly affirmed in the executive
departments, as, for instance, by Mr. Marcy, Secretary of
State, in 1854, 2 Whart. Int. Dig. (2d ed.) p. 394; by Attorney General Black in 1859, 9 Opinions, 373 ; and by Attorney
General Bates in. 1862, 10 Opinions, 328, 382, 394, 396.
Chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries, speaking of the "general division of the inhabitants of every country, under the
comprehensive title of aliens and natives," says: "Natives are
'All persons born within the jurisdiction and allegiance of the
nited States. This is the rule of the common law, without
;any regard or reference to the political condition or allegiance
of their parents, with the exception of the children of ambassadors, who are in theory born within the allegiance of the
foreign power they represent." "To create allegiance by birth,
the party must be born, not only within the territory, but
within the ligeance of the government. If a portion of the
country be taken and held by conquest in war, the conqueror
acquires the rights of the conquered as to its dominion and government, and children born in the armies of a State, while

abroad and occupying a foreign country, are deemed to be born
in the allegiance of the sovereign to whom the army belongs.
It is equally the doctrine of the English common law, that
during such hostile occupation of a territory, and the parents
be adhering to the enemy as subjects de facto, their children,
born under such a temporary dominion, are not born under the
ligeance of the conquered." 2 Kent Com. (6th ed.) 39, 42.
And he elsewhere says: "And if, at common law, all human
beings born within the ligeance of the King, and under the
King's obedience, were natural-born subjects, and not aliens,
I do not perceive why this doctrine does not apply to these
United States, in all cases in which there is no express constitutional or statute declaration to the contrary." "Subject and
citizen are, in a degree, convertible terms as applied to natives;
and though the term citizen seems to be appropriate to republican freemen, yet we are, equally with the inhabitants of all
other countries, subjects, for we are equally bound by allegiance and subjection to the government and law of the land."
2 Kent Com. 258, note.
Mr. Binney, in the second edition of a paper on the Alienigenra of the United States, printed in pamphlet at Philadelphia,
with a preface bearing his signature and the date of December
1, 1853, said: "The common law principle of allegiance was
the law of all the States at the time of the Revolution, and at
the adoption of the Constitution; and by that principle the
citizens of the United States are, with the exceptions before
mentioned," (namely, foreign-born children of citizens, under
statutes to be presently referred to,) "such only as are either
born or made so, born within the limits and under the jurisdiction of t66 United States, or naturalized by the authority of
law, either in one of the States before the Constitution, or
since that time, by virtue of an act of the Congress of the
United States." p. 20. "The right of citizenship never descends in the legal sense, either by the common law, or under
the common naturalization acts. It is incident to birth in the
country, or it is given personally by statute. The child of an
alien, if born in the country, is as much a citizen as the naturalborn child of a citizen, and by operation of the same principle."

IV. It was contended by one of the learned counsel for the
United States that the rule of the Roman law, by which the
citizenship of the child followed that of the parent, was the
true rule of international law, as now recognized in most civilized countries, and had superseded the rule of the common
law, depending on birth within the realm, originally founded
on feudal considerations.
But at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of the
United States in 1789, and long before, it would seem to have
,been the rule in Europe generally, as it certainly was in
France, that, as said by Pothier, "citizens, true and nativeborn citizens, are those who are born within the extent of the
dominion of France," and "mere birth within the realm gives
the rights of a native-born citizen, independently of the origin
.of the father or mother, and of their domicil;" and children
born in a foreign country, of a French father who had not
established his domicil there nor given up the intention of
returning, were also deemed Frenchmen, as Laurent says, by
"a favor, a sort of fiction," and Calvo, "by a sort of fiction
of exterritoriality, considered as born in France, and therefore invested with- French nationality." Pothier Trait6 des

UNITED STATES v, WONG KIM ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

The Code Napoleon of 1807 changed the law of France, and
adopted, instead of the rule of country of birth, jue soli,
,the rule of descent or blood, j.us sanguinis, as the leading
principle; but an eminent commentator has observed that
the framers of that code "appear not to have wholly freed
themselves from the ancient rule of France, or rather, indeed,
ancient rule of Europe-de la 'viille r' glefranqaise,ou plut6t
mrne de la vieille r'.gle eurovpenne--- according to which nationality had always been, in former times, determined by the
.place of birth." 1 Demolombe Conrs de Code Napoleon,
(4th ed.) no. 146.
The later modifications of. the rule in Europe rest upon the
constitutions, laws or ordinances of the various countries, and
have no important bearing upon the interpretation and effect
of the Constitution of the United States. The English Naturalization Act of 33 Vict. (1870) c. 147, and the Commissioners'
Report of 1869 out of which it grew, both bear date since the
adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution;
and, as observed by Mr. Dicey, that act has not affected the
principle by which any person who, whatever the nationality
of his parents, is born within the British dominions, acquires
British nationality at birth, and is a natural-born British subject. Dicey Conflict of Laws, '141.
At the time of the passage of that act, although the tendency on the continent of
Europe was to make parentage, rather than birthplace, the
criterion of nationality, and, citizenship was denied to the
native-born children of foreign parents in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Norway, yet it appears still to have been
conferred upon such children in Holland, Denmark and Portugal, and, when claimed under certain specified conditions,
in France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Greece and Russia. Cockburn on Nationality, 14--21.
There is, therefore, little ground for the theory that, at the
time of the adoption of the Fourteentl Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States, there was any settled and
definite rule of international law, generally recognized by
civilized nations, inconsistent with the ancient rule of citizen,ship.by birth within the dominion.

OCTOBER TERISI, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

Nor can it be doubted that it is the inherent right of every
independent nation to determine for itself, and according to
its own constitution and laws, what classes of persons shall be
entitled to its citizenship.
Both in England and in the United States, indeed, statutes
have been passed, at various times, enacting that certain issue
born abroad of English subjects, or of American citizens,
respectively, should inherit, to some extent at least, the rights
of their parents. But those statutes applied only to cases
coming within their purport; and they have never been considered, in either country, as affecting the citizenship of
persons born within its dominion.
The earliest statute was passed in the reign of Edward IIl.
In the Rolls of Parliament of 17 Edw. III, (1343) it is stated
that "before these times there have been great doubt and
difficulty among the Lords of this realm, and the Commons,
as well men of the law as others, whether children who are
born in parts beyond sea ought to bear inheritance after the
death of their ancestors in England, because no certain law
has been thereon ordained;" and by the King, Lords and
Commons, it was unanimously agreed that "there was no
manner of doubt that the children of our Lord the King,
whether they were born on this side the sea or beyond the
sea, should bear the inheritance of their ancestors;" "and in
regard to other children, it was agreed in this Parliament, that
they also should inherit wherever they might be born in the
service of the King ;" but, because the Parliament was about
to depart, and the business demanded great advisement and
good deliberation how it should be best and most surely done,
the making of a statute was put off to the next Parliament.
2 Rot. Parl. 139. By reason, apparently, of the prevalence
of the plague in England, no act upon the subject was passed
until 25 Edw. III, .(1350) when Parliament passed an act,
entitled "A statute for those who are born in parts beyond
sea, by which -after reciting that "some people be in doubt
if the children born in the parts beyond the sea, out of the
ligeance of England, should be able to demand any inheritance
within the same ligeance, or not, whereof a petition-was put

UINITED STATES v. WONG KITI2 ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

in the Parliament" of 17 Edw. III, "and was not at the same
time wholly assented " - it was (1) agreed and affirmed, " that
the law of the Crown of England is, and always hath been
such, that the children of the Kings of England, in whatsoever parts they be born, in England or elsewhere, be able and
ought to bear the inheritance after the death of their ancestors;" (2) also agreed that certain persons named, "which
were born beyond the sea, out of the ligeance of England,
shall be from henceforth able to have and enjoy their inheritance after the death of their ancestors, in all parts within
the ligeance of England, as well as those that should be born
within the same ligeance:" (3) and further agreed "that all
children inheritors, which from henceforth shall be born without the ligeance of the King, whose fathers and mothers at
the time of their birth be and shall be at the faith and ligeance
of the King of England, shall have and enjoy the same benefits and advantages to have and bear the inheritance within
the same ligeance, as the other inheritors aforesaid, in time to
come; so always, that the mothers of such children do pass
the sea by the licence and wills of their husbands." 2 Rot.
Parl. 231; 1 Statutes of the Realm, 310.
It has sometimes been suggested that this general provision
of the statute of 25 Edw. III was declaratory of the common
law. See Bacon, arguendo, in Calvin's Case, 2 Howell's State
Trials, 585; Westlake and Pollock, arguendo, in Do Geer v.
Stone, 22 Ch. D. 243, 247; 2 Kent Com. 50, 53; Lynch v.
Clarke, 1 Sandf. Ch. 583, 659, 660; Ludlam v. Ludlam, 26
N. Y. 356. But all suggestions to that effect seem to have
been derived, immediately or ultimately, from one or the other
of these two sources: The one, the Year Book of 1 Ric. III,
(1483) fol. 4, pl. 7, reporting a saying of Hussey, C. J., "that he
who is born beyond sea, and his father and mother are English,
their issue inherit by the common law, but the statute makes
clear, &c.," - which, at best, was but obiter dictum, for the
Chief Justice appears to have finally rested his opinion on the
statute. The other, a note added to the edition of 1688 of
Dyer's Reports, 224a, stating that at Trinity Term '7Edw. III,
Rot. 2 B. R., it was adjudged that children of subjects born

670

Opinion of the Court.

beyond the sea in the service of the King were inheritable
which has been shown, by a search of the roll in the King's
Bench so referred to, to be a mistake, inasmuch as the child
there in question did not appear to have been born beyond
sea, but only to be living abroad. Westlake's Private International Law, (3d ed.) 324.
The statute of 25 Edw. III recites the existence of doubts
as to the right of foreign-born children to inherit in England;
and, while it is declaratory of the rights of children of the
King, and is retrospective as to the persons specifically named,
yet as to all others it is, in terms, merely prospective, applying
to those only "who shall be born henceforth." Mr. Binney,
in his paper above cited, after a critical examination of the
statute, and of the early English cases, concluded: "There is
nothing in the statute which would justify the conclusion that
it is declaratory of the common law in any but a single particular, namely, in regard to the children of the King; nor has
it at any time been judicially held to be so." "The notion
that there is any common law principle to naturalize the children born in foreign countries, of native-born American father
and mother, father or mother, must be discarded. There is
not, and never was, any such common law principle." Binney on Alienigenae, 14, 20; 2 Amer. Law. Reg. 199, 203.
And the great weight of the English authorities, before and
since he wrote, appears to support his conclusion. Calvin's
Case, 7 Rep. 17a, 18a; Co. Lit. 8a, and Hargrave's note 36;
1 Bl. Com. 373; Barrington on Statutes, (5th ed.) 268; Lord
Kenyon, in Doe v. Jones, 4 T. IR. 300, 308; Lord Chancellor
Cranworth, in Shedden v. Patrick, 1 Macq. 535, 611; Cockburn on Nationality, 7, 9; D3e Geer v. Stone, 22 Oh. D. 243,
252; Dicey Conflict of Laws, 178, 741. "The acquisition,"
says Mr. Dicey, (p. 741) "of nationality by descent, is foreign
to the principles of the common law, and is based wholly upon
statutory enactments."
It has been pertinently observed that if the statute of
Edward III had only been declaratory of the common law,
the subsequent legislation on the subject would have been
wholly unnecessary. Oockburn on Nationality, 9. By the

statute of 29 Car. II, (1677) c. 6, § 1, entitled "An. act for the'
naturalization of children of His Majesty's subjects born in
foreign countries during the late troubles," all persons who, at
any time between June 14, 1641, and March 24, 1660, "were
born out of His Majesty's dominions, and whose fathers or
mothers were natural-born subjects of this realm," were declared to be natural-born subjects. By the statute of 7 Anne,
(1708) c. 5, § 3, "the children of all natural-born subjects, born
out of the ligeance of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors"
- explained by the statute of 4 Geo. II, (1731) c. 21, to mean
all children born out of the ligeance of the Crown of England,
"whose fathers were or shall be natural-born subjects of the
Crown of England, or of Great Britain, at the time of the birth,
of such children respectively"-" shall be deemed, adjudged
and taken to be natural-born subjects of this kingdom, to all'
intents, constructions and purposes whatsoever." That statute
was limited to foreign-born children of natural-born subjects ;"
and was extended by the statute of 13 Geo. III, (1773) c. 21,
to foreign-born grandchildren of natural-born subjects, but not
to the issue of such grandchildren; or, as put by Mr. Dicey,
"British nationality does not pass by descent or inheritance

above cited; Dicey Conflict of Laws, 42.
. Moreover, under those statutes, as is stated in the IReport
in 1869 of the Commissioners for inquiring into the Laws of
Naturalization and Allegiance, "no attempt has ever been
made on the part of the British Government, (unless in Eastern countries where special jurisdiction is conceded by treaty,)
to enforce claims upon, or to assert rights in respect of, persons
born abroad, as against the country of their birth whilst they
were resident therein, and when by its law they were invested
with its nationality." In the appendix to their report are col-lected many such cases in which the British Government declined to interpose, the reasons being most clearly brought
out in a dispatch of March 13, 1858, from Lord Malmesbury,
the Foreign Secretary, to the British Ambassador at Paris,,
saying: "It is competent to any country to confer by general
or special legislation the privileges of nationality upon those

Opinion of the Court.

who are born out of its own territory; but it cannot confer
such privileges upon such persons as against the country of
their birth, when they voluntarily return to and reside therein.
Those born in the territory of a nation are (as a general principle) liable when actually therein to the obligations incident to
their status by birth. Great Britain considers-and treats such
persons as natural-born subjects, and cannot therefore deny
the right of other nations to do the same. But Great Britain
cannot permit the nationality of the children of foreign parents
born within her territory to be questioned." Naturalization

1873-1874, pp. 1237, 1337. See also Drummond's Case, (1834)
2 Knapp, 295.
By the Constitution of the United States, Congress was empowered "to establish an uniform rule of naturalization." In
the exercise of this power, Congress, by successive acts, beginning with the act entitled "An act to establish an uniform
rule of naturalization," passed at the second session of the
First Congress under the Constitution, has made provision
for the admission to citizenship of three principal classes of
persons: First. Aliens, having resided for a certain time
"within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United
States," and naturalized individually by proceedings in a
court of iecord. Second. Children of persons so naturalized,
"dwelling within the United States, and being under the
age of twenty-one years at the time of such naturalization."
Third. Foreign-born children of American citizens, coming
within the definitions prescribed by Congress. Acts of March
26, 1790, c. 3; January 29, 1795, c. 20; June 18, 1798, c. 54;
1 Stat. 103, 414, 566; April 14, 1802, c. 28; March 26, 1804,
c. 47; 2 Stat. 153, 292 ; February 10, 1855, c. 71; 10 Stat. 604;
Rev. Stat. § 2165, 2172, 1993.
In the act of 1790, the provision as to foreign-born children
of American citizens was as follows: "The children of citizens of the United States, that may be born beyond sea, or
out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as
natural-born citizens: Provided, that the right of citizenship
shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

resident in the United States." 1 Stat. 104. In 1795, this
was reenacted, in the same words, except in substituting, for
the words "beyond sea, or out of the limits of the United
States," the words "out of the limits and jurisdiction of the
United States." 1 Stat. 415.
In 1802, all former acts were repealed, and the provisions
concerning children of citizens were reenacted in this form:
"The children of persons duly naturalized under any of the
laws of the United States, or who, previous to the passing of
any law on that subject by the Government of the United
States, may have become citizens of any one of the said States
under the laws thereof, being under the age of twenty-one
years at the time of their parents being so naturalized or admitted to the rights of citizenship, shall, if dwelling in the
United States, be considered as citizens of the United States;
and the children of persons who now are, or have been citizens of the United States shall, though born out of the limits
and jurisdiction of the United States, be considered as citizens
of the United States : Provided, that the right of citizenship
shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never resided
within the United States." Act of April 14, 1802, c. 28, § 4;
2 Stat. 155.
The provision of that act, concerning "the children- of persons duly naturalized under any of the laws of the United
States," not being restricted to the children of persons already
naturalized, might well be held to include children of persons
thereafter to be naturalized. 2 Kent Com. 51, 52; West v.
lMest, 8 Paige, 433 ; United States v. -Yellar, 11 Bissell, 314;
Boyd v. Thayer, 143 U. S.135, 177.
But the provision concerning foreign-born children, being
expressly limited to the children of persons who then were or
had been citizens, clearly did not include foreign-born children
of any person who became a citizen since its enactment.
2 Kent Com. 52, 53 ; Binney on Alienigene, 20, 25 ; 2 Amer.
Law Reg. 203, 205. Mr. Binney's paper, as he states in his
preface, was printed by him in the hope that Congress might
supply this defect in our law.
In accordance with his suggestions, it was enacted by the
VOL. cLXX-43

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

statute of February 10, 1855, c. 71, that "persons heretofore
born, or hereafter to be born, out of the limits and jurisdiction
of the United States, whose fathers were or shall be at the
time of their birth citizens of the United States, shall be
deemed and considered and are hereby declared to be citizens
of the United States: Provided, however, that the rights of
citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers never
resided in the United States." 10 Stat. 601; Rev. Stat. § 1993.
It thus clearly appears that, during the half century intervening between 1802 and 1855, there was no legislation whatever for the citizenship of children born abroad, during that
period, of American parents who had not become citizens of
the United States before the act of 1802; and that the act of
1855, like every other act of Congress upon the subject, has,
by express proviso, restricted the right of citizenship, thereby
conferred upon foreign-born children of American citizens, to
those children themselves, unless they became residents of the
United States. Here is nothing to countenance the theory
that a geneial rule of citizenship by blood or descent has displaced in this country the fundamental rule of citizenship by
birth within its sovereignty.
So far as we are informed, there is no authority, legislative,
executive or judicial, in England or America, which maintains
or intimates that the statutes (whether considered as declaratory, or as merely prospective,) conferring citizenship on
foreign-born children of citizens, have superseded or restricted, in any respect, the established rule of citizenship by
birth within the dominion. Even those authorities in this
country, which have gone the farthest towards holding such
statutes to be but declaratory of the common law, have distinctly recognized and emphatically asserted the citizenship of
native-born children of foreign parents. 2 Kent Com. 39, 50,
53, 258 note; _ynch v. Clarke, 1 Sandf. Ch. 583, 659; Ludlam.

Passing by questions once earnestly controverted, but finally
put at rest by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution,

Amendment, all white persons, at least, born within the sovereignty of the United States, whether children of citizens or
of foreigners, excepting only children of ambassadors or public ministers of a foreign government, were native-born citizens
of the United States.
V. In the fore front, both of the Fourteenth Amendment
of the Constitution, and of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the
fundamental principle of citizenship by birth within the dominion was reaffirmed in the most explicit and comprehensive
terms.
The Civil Rights Act, passed at the first session of the
Thirty-ninth Congress, began by enacting that "all persons
born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign
power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be
citizens of the United States; and such citizens, of every race
and color, without regard to any previous condition of slavery
or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime
whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall have
the same right, in every State and Territory in the United States,
to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real and
personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and
proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment,
pains and penalties, and to none other, any law, statute, ordinance, regulation or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding."
Act of April 9, 1866, c. 31, § 1; 14 Stat. 27.
The samb Congress, shortly afterwards, evidently thinking
it unwise, and perhaps unsafe, to leave so important a declaration of rights to depend upon an ordinary act of legislation,
which might be repealed by any subsequent Congress, framed
the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, and on June
16, 1866, by joint resolution proposed it to the legislatures of

stitution begins with the words, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,
are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they
reside." As appears upon the face of the amendment, as well
as from the history of the times, this was not intended to impose any new restrictions upon citizenship, or to prevent any
persons from becoming citizens by the fact of birth within the
United States, who would thereby have become citizens according to the law existing before its adoption. It is declaratory in form, and enabling and extending in effect. Its main
purpose doubtless was, as has been often recognized by this
court, to establish the citizenship of free negroes, which had
been denied in the opinion delivered by Chief Justice Taney
in Dred Scott v. Sandford, (1857) 19 How. 393; and to put it
beyond doubt that all blacks, as well as whites, born or naturalized within the jurisdiction of the United States, are citizens
of the United States. Thie Slaughterhouse Cases, (1873) 16
Wall. 36, 73; Strauder v. WVest Virginia, (1879) 100 U. S. 303,

-Delaware,(1880) 103 U. S. 370, 386; -Elk v. Wilkins, (1884)
112 U. S. 94, 101. But the opening words, "All persons born,"
are general, not to say universal, restricted only by place and
jurisdiction, and not by color or race -as was clearly recognized in all the opinions delivered in Tle Slaughterlouse Cases,
above cited.
In those cases, the point adjudged was that a statute of
Louisiana, granting to a particular corporation the exclusive
right for twenty-five years to have and maintain slaughter,houses within a certain district including the city of New
Orleans, requiring all cattle intended for sale or slaughter in
that district to be brought to the yards and slaughterhouses
of the grantee, authorizing all butchers to slaughter their
cattle there, and empowering the grantee to exact a reasonable fee for each animal slaughtered, was within the police
powers of the State, and not in conflict with the Thirteenth
Amendment of the Constitution as creating an involuntary
servitude, nor with the Fourteenth Amendment as abridging
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

or as depriving persons of their liberty or property without
due process of law, or as denying to them the equal protection of the laws.
Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the opinion of the majority
of the court, after observing that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Articles of Amendment of the Constitution
were all addressed to the grievances of the negro race, and
were designed to remedy them, continued as follows: "We
do not say that no one else but the negro can share in this
protection. Both the language and spirit of these Articles
are to have their fair and just weight in any question of construction. Undoubtedly, while negro slavery alone was in
the mind of the Congress which proposed the Thirteenth
Article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter.
If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall
develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our
territory, this Amendment may safely be trusted to make it
void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States, which
properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these
Articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent." 16 Wall. 72. And in
treating of the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, he
said: "The distinction between citizenship of the United
States and citizenship of a State is clearly recognized and
established. N~ot only may a man be a citizen of the United
States without being a citizen of a State, but an important
element is necessary to convert the former into the latter.
He must reside within the State to make him a citizen of it,
but it is only necessary'that he should be born or naturalized
in the United States to be a citizen of the Union." 16 Wall.
73, 74.
Mr. Justice Field, in a dissenting opinion, in which Chief
Justice Chase and Justices Swayne and Bradley concurred,
said of the same clause: "It recognizes in express terms, if it
does not create, citizens of the United States, and it makes
their citizenship dependent- upon the place of their birth, or
the fact of their adoption, and not upon the constitution or
laws of any State or the condition of their ancestry." 16 Wall.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

95, 111. Mr. Justice Bradley also said: ." The question is
now settled by the Fourteenth Amendment itself, that citizenship of the United States is the primary citizenship in this
country; and that state citizenship is secondary and derivative, depending upon citizenship of the United States and the
citizen's place of residence. The States have not now, if they
ever had, any power to restrict their citizenship to any classes
or persons." 16 Wall. 112. And Mr. Justice Swayne added:
"The language employed is unqualified in its scope. There
is no exception in its terms, and there can be properly none
in their application. By the language ' citizens of the United
States' was meant all such citizens; and by 'any person' was
meant all persons within the jurisdiction of the State. No
distinction is intimated on account of race or color. This
court has no authority to interpolate a limitation that is
neither expressed nor implied. Our duty is to execute the
law, not to make it. The protection provided was not intended to be confined to those of any particular race or class,
but to embrace equally all races, classes and conditions of
men." 16 Wall. 128, 129.
Mr. Justice Miller, indeed, while discussing the causes
which led to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment,
made this remark: "The phrase, 'subject to its jurisdiction,'
was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign States, born
within the United States." 16 Wall. 73. This was wholly
aside frbm the question in judgment, and from the course of
reasoning bearing upon that question. It was unsupported
by any argument, or by any reference to authorities; and
that it was not formulated with the same care and exactness,
as if the case before the court had called for an exact definition of the phrase, is apparent from its classing foreign ministers and consuls together- whereas it was then well settled
law, as has since been recognized in a judgment of this court
in which Mr. Justice Miller concurred, that consuls, as such,
and unless expressly invested with a diplomatic character in
:addition to their ordinary powers, are not considered as entrusted with authority to represent their sovereign in his in-

tercourse with foreign States or to vindicate his prerogatives,
or entitled by the law of nations to the privileges and immunities of ambassadors or public ministers, but are subject to
the jurisdiction, civil and criminal, of the courts of the country
in which they reside. 1 Kent Com. 44; Story Conflict of
Laws, § 48; Wheaton International Law, (8th ed.) § 249;

424.
In weighing a remark uttered under such circumstances, it
is well to bear in mind the often quoted words of Chief Justice
Marshall: "It is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general
expressions, in eve'y opinion, are to be taken in connection
with the case in which those expressions are used. If they
go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought notto control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very
point is presented for decision. The reason of this maxim
is obvious. The question actually before the court is investigated with care, and considered in its full extent. Other
principles which may serve to illustrate it are considered in
their relation to the case decided, but their possible bearing
on all other cases is seldom completely investigated." Cokens
v. Yirginia, (1821) 6 Wheat. 264, 399.
That neither Mr. Justice Miller, nor any of the justices who
took part in the decision of The Slaughterhouse ( ases, understood the court to be committed to the view that all children
born in the United States of citizens or subjects of foreign
States were excluded from the operation of the first sentence
of the Fourteenth Amendment, is manifest from a unanimous
judgment of the court, delivered but two years later, while
all those judges but Chief Justice Chase were still on the
bench, in which Chief Justice Waite said: "Allegiance and
protection are, in this connection" (that is, in relation to
citizenship,) "reciprocal obligations. The one is a compensation for the other: allegiance for protection, and protection
for allegiance." "At common law, with the nomenclature
of which the framers of the Constitution were familiar, it
was never doubted that all children, born in a country, of

Opinion of the Court.

parents who were its citizens, became themselves, upon their
birth, citizens also. These were natives, or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further and include as citizens children born within
the jurisdiction, without reference to the citizenship of their
parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never
as to the first. For the purposes of this case it is not necessary to solve these doubts. It is sufficient, for everything we
,have now to consider, that all children, born of citizen parents
within the jurisdiction, are themselves citizens." .Minor v.
Hap.perseUt, (1874) 21 Wall. 162, 166-168. The decision in
that case was that a woman born of citizen parents within
the United States was a citizen of the United States, although
not entitled to vote, the right to the elective franchise not
being essential to cieizenship.
The only adjudication that has been made by this court
upon the meaning of the clause, "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," in the leading provision of the Fourteenth
Amendment, is -Elk v. ilkins, 112 U. S. 91, in which it was
decided that an Indian born a member of one of the Indian
tribes within the United States, which still existed and was
recognized as an Indian tribe by the United States, who had
voluntarily separated himself from his tribe, and taken up his
residence among the white citizens of a State, but who did
not appear to have been naturalized, or taxed, or in any way
recognized or treated as a citizen, either by the United States
or by the State, was not a citizen of the United States, as
a person born in the United States, "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," within the meaning of the clause in question.
That decision was placed upon the grounds, that the meaning of those words was, "not merely subject in some respect or
degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely
subject to their political jurisdiction, and owing them direct
and immediate allegiance;" that by the Constitution, as
originally established, "Indians not taxed" were excluded
from the persons according to whose numbers representatives
in Congress and direct taxes were apportioned among the

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

several States, and Congress was empowered to regulate commerce, not only "with foreign nations," and among the several States, but "with the Indian tribes;" that the Indian
tribes, being within the territorial limits of the United States,
were not, strictly speaking, foreign States, but were alien
nations, distinct political communities, the members of which
owed immediate allegiance to their several tribes, and were
not part of the people of the United States; that the alien
and dependent condition of the members of one of those
tribes could not be put off at their own will, without the
action or assent of the United States; and that they were
never deemed citizens, except when naturalized, collectively
or individually, under explicit provisions of a treaty, or of an
act of Congress; and, therefore, that "Indians born within
the territorial limits of the United States, members of, and
owing immediate allegiance to, one of the Indian tribes (an
alien, though dependent, power), although in a geographical
sense born in the United States, are no more 'born in the
United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,' within
the meaning of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, than the children of subjects of any foreign government
born within the domain of that government, or the children
born within the United States of ambassadors or other public
ministers of foreign nations." And it was observed that the
language used, in defining citizenship, in the first section of
the Civil Rights Act of 1866, by the very Congress which
framed the Fourteenth Amendment, was "all persons born in
the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed." 112 U. S.99-103.
Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Woods, dissenting, were
of opinion that the Indian in question, having severed himself
from his tribe and become a bonafide resident of a State, had
thereby become subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment;
and, in reference to the Civil Rights Act of 1866, said: "Beyond question, by that act, national citizenship was conferred
directly upon all persons in this country, of whatever race
(excluding only 'Indians not taxed:'), who were born within

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

the territorial limits of the United States, and were not subject to any foreign power." And that view was supported
by reference to the debates in the Senate upon that act, and
to the ineffectual veto thereof by President Johnson, in which
he said : "By the first section of the bill, all persons born in
the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are declared to be citizens of the
United States. This provision comprehends the Chinese of the
Pacific States, Indians subject to taxation, the people called
Gypsies, as well as the entire race designated as blacks, persons of color, negroes, mulattoes, and persons of African blood.
Every individual of those races, born in the United States, is,
by the bill, made a citizen of the United States." 112 U. S.
119-147.
The decision in Elk v. Wilkins concerned only members of
the Indian tribes within the United States, and had no tendency to deny citizenship to children born in the United
States of foreign parents of Caucasian, African or Mongolian
descent, not in the diplomatic service of a foreign country.
The real object of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, in qualifying the words, "All persons born in the
United States," by the addition, "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," would appear to have been to exclude, by the
fewest and fittest words, (besides children of members of the
Indian tribes, standing in a peculiar relation to the National
Government, unknown to the common law,) the two classes
of cases -children
born of alien enemies in hostile occupation, and children of diplomatic representatives of a foreign
State - both of which, as has already been shown, by the law
of England, and by our own law, from the time of the first
settlement of the English colonies in America, had been recognized exceptions to the fundamental rule of citizenship by
birth within the country.

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM AR K.
Opinion of the Court.

In United States v. Rice, (1819) 4 Wheat. 246, goods imported into Castine, in the State of Maine, while it was in the
exclusive possession of the British authorities during the last
war with England, were held not to be subject to duties under
the revenue laws of the United States, because, as was said
by Mr. Justice Story in delivering judgment: "By the conquest and military occupation of Gastine, the enemy acquired
that firm possession which enabled him to exercise the fullest
rights of sovereignty over that place. The sovereignty of
the United States over the territory was, of course, suspended,
and the laws of the United States could no longer be rightfully enforced tlere, or be obligatory upon the inhabitants
who remained and submitted to the conquerors. By the surrender the inhabitants passed under a temporary allegiance
to the British Government, and were bound by such laws,
and such only, as it chose to recognize and impose. From
the nature of the case, no other laws could be obligatory
upon them, for, where there is no protection or allegiance
or sovereignty, there can be no claim to obedience." 4
Wheat. 254.
In the great case of The Exchange, (1812) 7 Cranch, 116, the
grounds upon which foreign ministers are, and other aliens are
not, exempt from the jurisdiction of this country, were set
forth by Chief Justice Marshall in a clear and powerful train
of reasoning, of which it will be sufficient, for our present purpose, to give little more than the outlines. The opinion did
not touch upon the anomalous case of the Indian tribes, the
true relation of which to the United States was not directly
brought before this court until some years afterwards in
Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, (1831) 5 Pet. 1; nor upon the
case of a suspension of the sovereignty of the United States
over part of their territory by reason of a hostile occupation,
such as was also afterwards presented in United States v. Rice,
above cited. But in all other respects it covered the whole
question of what persons within the territory of the United
States are subject to the jurisdiction thereof.
The Chief Justice first laid down the general principle:
"The jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is

necessarily exclusive and absolute.
limitation not imposed by itself.

It is susceptible of no
Any restriction upon it,

deriving validity from an external source, would imply a diminution of its sovereignty to the extent of the restriction, and
an investment of that sovereignty to the same extent in that
power which could impose such restriction. All exceptions,
therefore, to the full and complete power of a nation within
its own territories, must be traced up to the consent of the
nation itself. They can flow from no other legitimate source.
This consent may be either express or implied. In the latter
case, it is less determinate, exposed more to the uncertainties
of construction; but, if understood, not less obligatory." 7
Cranch, 136.
He then stated, and supported by argument and illustration,
the propositions, that "this full and absolute territorial jurisdiction, being alike the attribute of every sovereign, and being
incapable of conferring extra-territorial power," has "given
rise to a class of cases in which every sovereign is understood
to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction, which has been stated to be the attribute
of every nation " - the first of which is the exemption from

arrest or detention of the person of a foreign sovereign entering its territory with its license, because "a foreign sovereign
is not understood as intending to subject himself to a jurisdiction incompatible with his dignity and the dignity of his
nation;" "a second case, standing on the same principles with
the first, is the immunity which all civilized nations allow to
foreign ministers;" "a third case, in which a sovereign is
understood to cede a portion of his territorial jurisdiction, is
where he allows the troops of a foreign prince to pass through
his dominions;" and, in conclusion, that "a public armed ship,
in the service of a foreign sovereign, with whom the Government of the United States is at peace, and having entered an
American port open for her reception, on the terms on which
ships of war are generally permitted to enter the ports of a
friendly power, must be considered as having come into the
American territory, under an implied promise, that while
necessarily within it, and demeaning herself in a friendly

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

manner, she should be exempt from the jurisdiction of the
country." 7 Cranch, 137-139, 147.
As to the immunity of a foreign minister, he said: "Whatever may be the principle on which this immunity is established, whether we consider him as in the place of the
sovereign he represents; or by a political fiction suppose him
to be extra-territorial, and therefore, in point of law, not
within the jurisdiction of the sovereign at whose court he
resides; still the immunity itself is granted by the governing
power of the nation to which the minister is deputed. This
fiction of exterritoriality could not be erected and supported
against the will of the sovereign of the territory. He is supposed to assent to it." "The assent of the sovereign to the
very important and extensive exemptions from territorial
jurisdiction, which are admitted to attach to foreign ministers,
is implied from the considerations that, without such exemption,
every sovereign would hazard his own dignity by employing
a public minister abroad. His minister would owe temporary
and local allegiance to a foreign prince, and would be less
competent to the objects of his mission. A sovereign committing the interests of his nation with a foreign power, to the
care of a person whom he has selected for that purpose, cannot intend to subject his minister in any degree to that power;
and, therefore, a consent to receive him, implies a consent that
he shall possess those privileges which his principal intended
he should retain - privileges which are essential to the dignity
of his sovereign, and to the duties he is bound to perform."
7 Cranch, 138, 139.
The reasons for not allowing to other aliens exemption
"from the jurisdiction of the country in which they are found"
were stated as follows: "When private individuals of one nation spread themselves through another as business or caprice
may direct, mingling indiscriminately with the inhabitants of
that other, or when merchant vessels enter for the purposes of
trade, it would be obviously inconvenient and dangerous to
society, and would subject the laws to continual infraction,
and the government to degradation, if such individuals or merchants did not owe temporary and local allegiance, and were

OCTOBER TERAI, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

not amenable to the jurisdiction of the country. Nor can
the foreign sovereign have any motive for wishing such ex-

emption. His subjects thus passing into foreign countries are
not employed by him, nor are they engaged in national pursuits. Consequently there are powerful motives for not exempting persons of this description from the jurisdiction of
the country in which they are found, and no one motive for
requiring it. The implied license, therefore, under which they
enter, can never be construed to grant such exemption." 7
Cranch, 144.
In short, the judgment in the case of The Exchange declared, as incontrovertible principles, that the jurisdiction of
every nation within its own territory is exclusive and absolute,
and is susceptible of no limitation not imposed by the nation
itself; that all exceptions to its full and absolute territorial
jurisdiction must be traced up to its own consent, express or
implied; that upon its consent to cede, or to waive the exercise
of, a part of its territorial jurisdiction, rest the exemptions
from that jurisdiction of foreign sovereigns or their armies
entering its territory with its permission, and of their foreign
ministers and public ships of war; and that the implied license, under which private individuals of another nation enter
the territory and mingle indiscriminately with its inhabitants,
for purposes of business or pleasure, can never be construed to
grant to them an exemption from the jurisdiction of the country in which they are found. See also CarZisle v. United
States, (1872) 16 Wall. 147, 155; Radich v. Hutchins, (1877)

Ping v. United States, (1889) 130 U. S. 581, 603, 604.
From the first organization of the National Government
under the Constitution, the naturalization acts of the United
States, in providing for the admission of aliens to citizenship
by judicial proceedings, uniformly required every applicant to
have resided for a certain time "within the limits and under
the jurisdiction of the United States;" and thus applied the
words "under the jurisdiction of the United States" to aliens
residing here before they had taken an oath to support the
Constitution of the United States, or had renounced allegiance

Opinion of the Court.

to a foreign government. Acts of March 26, 1790, c. 3; January 29, 1795, c. 20, § 1; June 18, 1798, c. 54, §§ 1, 6; 1 Stat.
103, 414, 566, 568; April 14, 1802, c. 28, § 1; 2 Stat. 153;
March 22, 1816, c. 32, § 1; 3 Stat. 258; May 21, 1828, c. 116,
§ 2; 4 Stat. 310; Rev. Stat. § 2165. And, from 1795, the provisions of those acts, which granted citizenship to foreign-born
children of American parents, described such children as "born
out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States." Acts
of January 29, 1795, c. 20, § 3; 1 Stat. 415; April 14, 1802,
c. 28, § 4; 2 Stat. 155; February 10, 1855, c. 71; 10 Stat. 604;
Rev. Stat. §§ 1993, 2172. Thus Congress, when dealing with
the question of citizenship in that aspect, treated aliens residing in this country as "under the jurisdiction of the United
States," and American parents residing abroad as "out of the
jurisdiction of the United States."
The words "in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," in the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, must be presumed to have been
understood and intended by the Congress which proposed the
Amendment, and by the legislatures which adopted it, in the
same sense in which the like words had been used by Chief
Justice Marshall in the well known case of The .Exchange;
and as the equivalent of the words "within the limits and
under the jurisdiction of the United States," and the converse
of the words, "out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United
States," as habitually used in the naturalization acts. This
presumption is confirmed by the use of the word "jurisdiction" in the last clause of the same section of the Fourteenth
Amendment, which forbids any State to "deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." It is
impossible to construe the words "subject to the jurisdiction
thereof," in the opening sentence, as less comprehensive than
the words "within its jurisdiction," in the concluding sentence
of the same section; or to hold that persons "within the jurisdiction" of one of the States of the Union are not "subject to
the jurisdiction of the United States."
These considerations confirm the view, already expressed in
this opinion, that the opening sentence of the Fourteenth

OCTOBER TERM\,

Opinion of the Court.

Amendment is throughout affirmative and declaratory, intended to allay doubts and to settle controversies which had
arisen, and not to impose any new restrictions upon citizenship.
By the Civil Rights Act of 1866, "all persons born in the
United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed," were declared to be citizens of the
United States. In the light of the law as previously estblished, and of the history of the times, it can hardly be doubted
that the words of that act, "not subject to any foreign power,"
were not intended to exclude any children born in this country from the citizenship which would theretofore have been
their birthright; or, for instance, for the first time in our history, to deny the right of citizenship to native-born children
of foreign white parents not in the diplomatic service of their
own country, nor in hostile occupation of part of our territory.
But any possible doubt in this regard was removed when the
negative words of the Civil Rights Act, "not subject to any
foreign power," gave way, in the Fourteenth Amendment of
the Constitution, to the affirmative words, "subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States."
This sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment is declaratory
of existing rights, and affirmative of existing law, as to each
of the qualifications therein expressed-" born in the United
States," "naturalized in the United States," and "subject to
the jurisdiction thereof "-in
short, as to everything relating to
the acquisition of citizenship by facts occurring within the limits
of the United States. But it has not touched the acquisition
of citizenship by being born abroad of American parents; and
has left that subject to be regulated, as it had always been, by
Congress, in the exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution to establish an uniform rule of naturalization.
The effect of the enactments conferring citizenship on foreign-born children of American parents has been defined, and
the fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the dominion of the United States, notwithstanding alienage of
parents, has been affirmed, in well considered opinions of the
executive departments of the Government, since the adoption
of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.

UNITED STATES v. WON G KIM ARK.

689

Opinion of the Court.

In 1869, Attorney General Hoar'gave to Mr. Fishthe Secretary of State, an opinion that children born and domiciled
abroad, whose fathers were native-born citizens of the United
States and had at some time resided therein, were, under the
statute of February 10, 1855, c. 71, citizens of the United
States, and "entitled to all the privileges of citizenship which
it is in the power of the United States Government to confer.
Within the sovereignty and jurisdiction of this nation, they
are undoubtedly entitled to all the privileges of citizens."
"But," the Attorney General added, "while the United
States may, by law, fix or declare the conditions constituting
citizens of the country within its 'own territorial jurisdiction,
and may confei! the rights of American citizens everywhere
upon persons who are not rightfully subject to the authority
of any foreign country or government, it is clear that the
United States cannot, by undertaking to confer the rights of
citizenship upon the subjects of a foreign nation, who have
not come within our territory, interfere with the just rights of
such nation to the government and control of its own subjects.
If, therefore, by the laws of the country of their birth, children of American citizens, born in that country, are subjects
of its government, I do not think that it is competent to the
United States, by any legislation, to interfere with that relation, or, by undertaking to extend to them the rights of citizens of this country, to interfere with the allegiance which
they may owe to the country of their birth while they continue within its territory, or to change the relation to other
foreign nations which, by reason of their place of birth, may
at any time exist. The rule of the common law I understand
to be, that a person 'born in a strange country, under the
obedience of a strange prince or country, is an alienI (Co. Lit.
128b,) and that every person owes allegiance to the country
of his birth." 13 Opinions of Attorneys General, 89-91.
In 1871, Mr. Fish, writing to Mr. Marsh, the American
Minister to Italy, said: "The Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution declares that 'all persons born or naturalized
in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,
are citizens of the United States.' This is simply an affirmVOL. cLXIx-44

ance of the common law of England and of this country, so
far as it asserts the status of citizenship to be fixed by the
place of nativity, irrespective of parentage. The qualification,
' and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,' was probably intended
to exclude the children of foreign ministers, and of other persons who may be within our territory with rights of extraterritoriality." 2 Whart. Int. Dig. p. 394.
In August, 1873, President Grant, in the exercise of the au'thority expressly conferred upon the President by art. 2, sect.
2, of the Constitution, to "require the opinion, in writing, of
the principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon
any subject relating to the diuties of their respective offices,"
required the opinions of the members of his cabinet upon several questions of allegiance, naturalization and expatriation.
Mr. Fish, in his opinion, which is entitled to much weight, as
well from the circumstances under which it was rendered, as
from its masterly treatment of the subject, said:
"Every independent State has as one of the incidents of its
sovereignty the right of municipal legislation and jurisdiction
over all persons within its territory, and may therefore change
their nationality by naturalization, and this, without regard to
the municipal laws of the country whose subjects are so naturalized, as long as they remain, or exercise the rights conferred
by naturalization, within the territory and jurisdiction of the
State which grants it.
"It may also endow with the rights and privileges of its
citizenship persons residing in other countries, so as to entitle
them to all rights of property and of succession within its
limits, and also with political privileges and civil rights to be
enjoyed or exercised within the territory and jurisdiction of
the State thus conferring its citizenship.
"But no sovereignty can extend its jurisdiction beyond its
own territorial limits so as to relieve those born under and
subject to another jurisdiction, from their obligations or duties
thereto; nor can the municipal law of one State interfere with
the duties or obligations which its citizens incur, while voluntarily resident in such foreign State and without the jurisdiction of their own country.

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARKM
Opinion of the Court.

"It is evident from the proviso in the act of 10th February,
1855, viz., ' that the rights of citizenship shall not descend to
persons whose fathers never resided in the United States,'
that the law-making power not only had in view this limit to
the efficiency of its own municipal enactments in foreign jurisdiction; but that it has conferred only a qualified citizenship
upon the children of American fathers born without the jurisdiction of the United States, and has denied to them, what
pertains to other American citizens, the right of transmitting
citizenship to their children, unless they shall have made
themselves residents of the United States, or, in the language
of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, have made
themselves 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'
"The child born of alien parents in the United States is
held to be a citizen thereof, and to be subject to duties with
regard to this country which do not attach to the father.
"The same principle on which such children are held by us
to be citizens of the United States, and to be subject to duties
to this country, applies to the children of American fathersborn without the jurisdiction of the United States, and entitles the country within whose jurisdiction they are born to
claim them as citizens and to subject them to duties to it.
"Such children are born to a double character: the citizenship of the father is that of the child, so far as the laws of
the country of which the father is a citizen are concerned,
and within the jurisdiction of that country; but the child,
from the circumstances of his birth, may acquire rights and
owes another fealty besides that which attaches to the father."

the applicant, quoted and adopted the conclusions of Attorney

OCTOBER TER:M, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.

These opinions go to show that, since the adoption of the
Fourteenth Amendment, the executive branch of the Government, the one charged with the duty of protecting American
citizens abroad against unjust treatment by other nations, has
taken the same view of the act of Congress of 1855, declaring
children born abroad of American citizens to be themselves
citizens, which, as mentioned in a former part of this opinion,
the British Foreign Office has taken of similar acts of Parliament-holding that such statutes cannot, consistently with
our own established rule of citizenship by birth in this country, operate extra-territorially so far as to relieve any person
born and residing in a foreign country, and subject to its government, from his allegiance to that country.
In a very recent case, the Supreme Court of New Jersey
held that a person, born in this country of Scotch parents
w ho were domiciled but had not been naturalized here, was
"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States," within the
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and was "not subject to any foreign power," within the meaning of the Civil
Rights Act of 1866; and, in an opinion delivered by Justice
an Syckel, with the concurrence of Chief Justice Beasley,
said: "The object of the Fourteenth Amendment, as is well
known, was to confer upon the colored race the right of citizenship. It, however, gave to the colored people no right
superior to that granted to the white race. The ancestors of
all the colored people then in the United States were of foreign birth, and could not have been naturalized, or in any
way have become entitled to the right of citizenship. The
colored -people were no more subject to the jurisdiction of
the United States, by reason of their birth here, than were
the white children born in this country of parents who were
not citizens. The same rule must be applied to both races;
and unless the general rule, that when the parents are domiciled here birth establishes the right to citizenship, is accepted,
the Fourteenth Amendment has failed to accomplish its purpose, and the colored people are not citizens. The Fourteenth
Amendment, by the language, ' all persons born in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,' was intended

UNTED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.

Opinion of the Court.

to bring all races, without distinction of color, within the rule
which prior to that time pertained to the white race." Benny
v. O'Brien, (1895) 29 Vroom (58 N. J. Law), 36, 39, 40.
The foregoing considerations and authorities irresistibly
lead us to these conclusions: The Fourteenth Amendment
affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by
birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the
protection of the country, including all children here born of
resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as
the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and
during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with
the single additional exception of children of members of the
Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes.
The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United
States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States. Every citizen or subject of
another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance
and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States. His allegiance to the United
States is direct and immediate, and, although but local and
temporary, continuing only so long as he remains within our
territory, is yet, in the words of Lord Coke, in Calvin's Case,
7 Rep. 6a, "strong enough to make a natural subject, for if
he hath issue here, that issue is a natural-born subject;" and
his child, as said by Mr. Binney in his essay before quoted,
"if born in the country, is as much a citizen as the naturalborn child of a citizen, and by operation of the same principle."
It can hardly be denied that an alien is completely subject to
the political jurisdiction of the country in which he resides seeing that, as said by Mr. Webster, when Secretary of State,
in his Report to the President on Thrasher's Case in 1851, and
since repeated by this court, "independently of a residence
with intention to continue such residence; independently of
any domiciliation; independently of the taking of any oath
of allegiance or of renouncing any former allegiance, it is
well known that, by the public law,.an alien, or a stranger

born, for so long a time as he continues within the dominions
of a foreign government, owes obedience to the laws of that
government, and may be punished for treason, or other crimes,as a native-born subject might be, unless his case is varied by
some treaty stipulations." Ex. Doc. H. iR. No. 10, 1st sess.

To hold that the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution excludes from citizenship the children, born in the United
States, of citizens or subjects of other countries, would be to
deny citizenship to thousands of persons of English, Scotch,
Irish, German or other European parentage, who have always
been considered and treated as citizens of the United States.
VI. Whatever considerations, in the absence of a controlling
provision of the Constitution, might influence the legislative
or the executive branch of the Government to decline to admit
persons of the Chinese race to the status of citizens of the
United States, there are none that can constrain or permit
the judiciary to refuse to give full effect to the peremptory
and explicit language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which
declares and ordains that "All persons born or naturalized in
the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are
citizens of the United States."
Chinese persons, born out of the United States, remaining
subjects of the Emperor of China, and not having become
citizens of the United States, are entitled to the protection of
and owe allegiance to the United States, so long as they are
permitted by the United States to reside here; and are "subject to the jurisdiction thereof," in the same sense as all other

of the city of San Francisco, regulating a certain business,
and which, as executed by the board of supervisors, made an
arbitrary discrimination between natives of China, still subjects
of the Emperor of China, but domiciled in the United States,
and all other persons, was contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Mr. Justice Matthews, in delivering
the opinion of the court, said: "The rights of the petitioners,
as affected by the proceedings of which they complain, are
not less, because they are aliens and subjects of the Emperor
of China." "The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution
is not confined to the protection of citizens. It says, I:Nor
shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property,
without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' These provisions are universal in their application, to all persons within the
territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of
race, of color, or of nationality; and the equal protection of
the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws. It is
accordingly enacted, by § 1977 of the Revised Statutes, that
' all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall
have the same right in every State and Territory to make and
enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the
full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the
security of persons and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties,
taxes, licenses and exactions of every kind, and to no other.'
The questions we have to consider and decide in these cases,
therefore, are to be treated as involving the rights of every
citizen of the United States, equally with those of the strangers
and aliens who now invoke the jurisdiction of this court." 118
U. S. 368, 369.
The manner in which reference was made, in the passage
above quoted, to § 1977 of the Revised Statutes, shows that
the change of phrase in that section, reenacting § 16 of the
statute of May 31, 1870, c. 114, 16 Stat. 144, as compared
with § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866- by substituting, for
the words in that act, "of every race and color," the words,
"within the jurisdiction of the United States " - was not

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
,Opinion of the Court.

considered as making the section, as it now stands, less appli-

cable to persons of every race and color and nationality, than
it was in its original form; and is hardly consistent with
attributing any narrower meaning to the words "subject to
the jurisdiction thereof" in the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, which may itself have
been the cause of the change in the phraseology of that provision of the Civil Rights Act.
The decision in JYick Wo v. HJopkins, indeed, did not directly
pass upon the effect of these words in the Fourteenth Amendment, but turned upon subsequent provisions of the same section.
But, as already observed, it is impossible to attribute to the
words, "subject to the jurisdiction thereof," that is to say, of the
United States, at the beginning, a less comprehensive meaning
than to the words "within its jurisdiction," that is, of the State,
at the end of the same section; or to hold that persons, who
are indisputably "within the jurisdiction." of the State, are
not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the Nation.
It necessarily follows that persons born in China, subjects of
the Emperor of China, but domiciled in the United States, having been adjudged, in Yi7k To v. Hop7ins, to be within the
jurisdiction of the State, within the meaning of the concluding
sentence, must be held to be subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States, within the meaning of the first sentence of this
section of the Constitution; and their children, "born in the
United States," cannot be less "subject to the jurisdiction
thereof."
Accordingly, in Qtock Ting v. United States, (1891) 140
U. S. 417, which, like the case at bar, was a writ of hiabeas coipus to test the lawfulness of the exclusion of a Chinese person
who alleged that he was a citizen of the United States by
birth, it was assumed on all hands that a person of the Chinese
race, born in the United States, was a citizen of the United
States. The decision turned upon the failure of the petitioner
to prove that he was born in this country; and the question
at issue was, as stated in the opinion of the majority of the
court, delivered by Mr. Justice Field, "whether the evidence
was sufficient to show that the petitioner was a citizen of the

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Opinion of the Court.

United States," or, as stated by Mr. Justice Brewer in his
dissenting opinion, "whether the petitioner was born in this
country or not." 140 U. S. 419, 423.
In State v. Ah Clew, (1881) 16 Nevada, 50, 58, the Supreme
Court of Nevada said: "The Amendments did not confer the
right of citizenship upon the Mongolian race, except such as
are born within the United States." In the courts of the
United States in the Ninth Circuit, it has been uniformly
held, in a series of opinions delivered by Mr. Justice Field,
Judge Sawyer, Judge Deady, Judge Hanford and Judge Morrow, that a child born in the United States of Chinese parents, subjects of the Emperor of China, is a native-born citizen
of the United States. In re Zooc Tin Sing, (1884) 10 Sawyer,

we are not aware of any judicial decision to the contrary.
During the debates in the Senate in January and February,
1866, upon the Civil IRights Bill, Mr. Trumbull, the chairman
of the committee which reported the bill, moved to amend
the first sentence thereof so as to read, "All persons born in
the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, are
hereby declared to be citizens of the United States, without
distinction of color." M r. Cowan, of Pennsylvania, asked,
"Whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies, born in this country?" M r.
Trumbull answered. "Undoubtedly;" and asked, "Is not .the
child born in this country of German parents a citizen?"
Mr. Cowan replied, "The children of German parents are
citizens; but Germans are not Chinese." Mr. Trumbull rejoined: '.'The law makes no such distinction; and the child of
an Asiatic is just as much a citizen as the child of a European."
Mr. Reverdy Johnson suggested that the words, "without
distinction of color," should be omitted as unnecessary; and
said : "The amendment, as it stands, is that all persons born
in the United States, and not subject to a foreign power, shall,
by virtue of birth, be citizens. To that I am willing to con-

sent; and that comprehends all persons, without any reference
to race or color, who may be so born." And Mr. Trumbull
agreed that striking out those words would make no difference in the meaning, but thought it better that they should
be retained, to remove all possible doubt. Congressional
Globe, 39th Congress, 1st sess. pt. 1, pp. 498, 573, 574.
The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution,. as originally framed by the House of Representatives, lacked the
opening sentence. When it came before the Senate in May,
1866, r. Howard, of Michigan, moved to amend by prefixing the sentence in its present form, (less the words "or
naturalized,") and reading, "All persons born in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of
the United States and of the State wherein they reside."
Mr. Cowan objected, upon the ground that the Mongolian
race ought to be excluded; and said: "Is the child of the
Chinese immigrant in California a citizen?" "I do not know
how my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese,
but I do know how some of his fellow-citizens regard them.
I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt
that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the
other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they
may. be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter
from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit."
Mr. Conness, of California, replied: "The proposition before
us relates simply, in that respect, to the children begotten of
Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare
that they shall be citizens. We have declared that by law;
now it is proposed to incorporate the same provision in the
fundamental instrument of the Nation. I am in favor of doing so. I voted for the proposition to declare that the children of all parentage whatever, born in California, should be
regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled
to equal civil rights with other citizens of the United States."
"We are entirely ready to accept the provision proposed in
this Constitutional Amendment, that the children born here
of Mongolian parents shall be declared by the Constitution of

Opinion of the Court.

the United States to be entitled to civil rights and to equal
protection before the law with others." Congressional Globe,
39th Congress, 1st sess. pt. 4, pp. 2890-2892. It does not appear to have been suggested, in either House of Congress,
that children born in the United States of Chinese parents
would not come within the terms and effect of the leading
sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Doubtless, the intention of the Congress which framed and
of the States which adopted this Amendment of the Constitution must be sought in the words of the Amendment; and
the debates in Congress are not admissible as evidence to control the meaning of those words. But the statements above
quoted are valuable as contemporaneous opinions of jurists
and statesmen upon the legal meaning of the words themselves; and are, at the least, interesting as showing that the
application of the Amendment to the Chinese race was considered and not overlooked.
The acts of Congress, known as the Chinese Exclusion Acts,
the earliest of which was passed some fourteen years after the
adoption of the Constitutional Amendment, cannot control its
meaning, or impair its effect, but must be construed and
executed in subordination to its provisions. And the right of
the United States, as exercised by and under those acts, to
exclude or to expel from the country persons of the Chinese
race, born in China, and continuing to be subjects of the Emperor of China, though having acquired a commercial domicil
in the United States, has been upheld by this court, for reasons
applicable to all aliens alike, and inapplicable to citizens, of
whatever race or color. C(hae Chan Ping v. United States,

class of aliens, absolutely or upon certain conditions, is an inherent and inalienable right of every sovereign and indepen-

dent nation, essential to its safety, its independence and its
welfare; that the power to exclude or to expel aliens, being a
power affecting international relations, is vested in the political departments of the Government, and is to be regulated by
treaty or by act of Congress, and to be executed by the executive authority according to the regulations so established, except so far as the judicial department has been authorized by
treaty or by statute, or is required by the paramount law of
the Constitution, to intervene; that the power to exclude and
the power to expel aliens rest upon one foundation, are derived
from one source, are supported by the same reasons, and are in
truth but parts of one and the same power; and, therefore,
that the power of Congress to expel, like the power to exclude
aliens, or any specified class of aliens, from the country, may
be exercised entirely through executive officers; or Congress
may call in the aid of the judiciary to ascertain any contested
facts on which an alien's right to be in the country has been
made by Congress to depend. 149 U. S. 711, 713, 714.
In Lem JMoon Sing v. United States, the same principles
were reaffirmed, and were applied to a Chinese person, born
in China, who had acquired a commercial domicil in the
United States, and who, having voluntarily left the country
on a temporary visit to China, and with the intention of
returning to and continuing his residence in this country,
claimed the right under a statute or treaty to reenter it; and
the distinction between the right of an alien to the protection
of the Constitution and laws of the United States for his person and property while within the jurisdiction thereof, and his
claim of a right to reenter the United States after a visit to
his native land, was expressed by the court as follows: "He
is none the less an alien, because of his having a commercial
domicil in this country. While he lawfully remains here, he
is entitled to the benefit of the guaranties of life, liberty and
property, secured by the Constitution to all persons, of whatever race, within the jurisdiction of the United States. His
personal rights when he is in this country, and such of his
property as is here during his absence, are as fully protected
by the supreme law of the land, as if he were a native or

naturalized citizen of the United States. But when he has
voluntarily gone from the country, and is beyond its jurisdiction, being an alien, he cannot reenter the United States
in violation of the will of the Government as expressed in
enactments of the law-making power." 158 U. S. 547, 548.
It is true that Chinese persons born in China cannot be
naturalized, like other aliens, by proceedings under the naturalization laws. But this is for want of any statute or treaty
authorizing or permitting such naturalization, as will appear
by tracing the history of the statutes, treaties and decisions
upon that subject - always bearing in mind that statutes
enacted by Congress, as well as treaties made by the President and Senate, must yield to the paramount and supreme
law of the Constitution.
The power, granted to Congress by the Constitution, "to
establish an uniform rule of naturalization," was long ago
adjudged by this court to be vested exclusively in Congress.
/t irac v. Chirac, (1817) 2 Wheat. 259. For many years
after the establishment of the original Constitution, and
until two years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress never authorized the naturalization of any but
"free white persons." Acts of March 26, 1790, c. 3, and January 29, 1795, c. 20; 1 Stat. 103, 414; April 14, 1802, c. 28,
and March 26, 1804, c. 47; 2 Stat. 153, 292; March 22, 1816,
c. 32; 3 Stat. 258; May 26, 1824, c. 186, and May 24, 1828,
c. 116; 4 Stat. 69, 310. By the treaty between the United
States and China, made July 28, 1868, and promulgated February 5, 1870, it was provided that "nothing herein contained
shall be held to confer naturalization upon citizens of the
United States in China, nor upon the subjects of China in
the United States." 16 Stat. 740. By the act of July 14;
1870, c. 251, § 7, for the first time, the naturalization laws
were "extended to aliens of African nativity and to persons
of African descent." 16 Stat. 256; This extension, as em:
bodied in the Revised Statutes, took the form of providing
that those laws should "apply to aliens [being free white
persons, and to aliens] of African nativity and to persons of
African descent;" and it was amended by the act of February

not to embrace Chinese aliens. In re Al Yty, "(1878) 5 Sawyer, 155. And by the act of May 6, 1882, c. 126, § 14, it was
expressly enacted that " hereafter no state court or court of the
United States shall admit Chinese to citizenship." 22 Stat. 61.
In Fong Yue Ting v. United States, (1S93) above cited, this
court said: "Chinese persons not born in this country have
never been recognized as citizens of the United States, nor
authorized to become such under the naturalization laws."
149 U. S. 716.
The Convention between the United States and China of
1894 provided that "Chinese laborers or Chinese of any
other class, either permanently or temporarily residing in
the United States, shall have for the protection of their persons and property all rights that are given by the laws of the
United States to citizens of the most favored nation, excepting the right to become naturalized citizens." 28 Stat. 1211.
And it has since been decided, by the same judge who held
this appellee to be a citizen of the United States by virtue of
his birth therein, that a native of China of the Mongolian
race could not be admitted to citizenship under the naturalization laws. -nre Gee Hop, (1895) 71 Fed. Rep. 274.
The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, in the declaration that "all persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of
the United States and of the State wherein they reside," contemplates two sources of citizenship, and two only: birth and
naturalization. Citizenship by naturalization can only be acquired by naturalization under the authority and in the forms
of law. But citizenship by birth is established by the mere
fact of birth under the circumstances defined in the Constitution. Every person born in the United States, and subject
to the jurisdiction thereof, becomes at once a citizen of the
United States, and needs no naturalization. .A person born
out of the jurisdiction of the United States can only become
a citizen by being naturalized, either by treaty, as in the case

Opinion of the Court.

of the annexation of foreign territory; or by authority of Congress, exercised either by declaring certain classes of persons
to be citizens, as in the enactments conferring citizenship upon
foreign-born children of citizens, or by enabling foreigners individually to become citizens by proceedings in the judicial tribunals, as in the ordinary provisions of the naturalization acts.
The power of naturalization, vested in Congress by the
Constitution, is a power to confer citizenship, not a power
to take it away. "A naturalized citizen," said Chief Justice
Marshall, "becomes a member of the society, possessing all
the rights of a native citizen, and standing, in the view of
the Constitution, on the footing of a native. The Constitution does not authorize Congress to enlarge or abridge those
rights. The simple power of the National Legislature is to
prescribe a uniform rule of naturalization, and the exercise
of this power exhausts it, so far as respects the individual.
The Constitution then takes him up, and, among other rights,
extends to him the capacity of suing in the courts of the
United States, precisely under the same circumstances under
which a native might sue." Osborn v. United States Bank,
9 Wheat. 738, 827. Congress having no power to abridge the
rights conferred by the Constitution upon those who have

.fortiori no act or omission of Congress, as to providing for
the naturalization of parents or children of a particular race,
can affect citizenship acquired as a birthright, by virtue of
the Constitution itself, without any aid of legislation. The
Fourteenth Amendment, while it leaves the power, where it
was before, in Congress, to regulate naturalization, has conferred no authority upon Congress to restrict the effect of
birth, declared by the Constitution to constitute a sufficient
and complete right to citizenship.
No one doubts that the Amendment, as soon as it was promulgated, applied to persons of African descent born in the
United States, wherever the birthplace of their parents might
have been; and yet, for two years afterwards, there was no
statute authorizing persons of that race to be naturalized. If
the omission or the refusal of Oongress to permit certain

Opinion of the Court.

classes of persons to be made citizens by naturalization could
be allowed the effect of correspondingly restricting the classes
of persons who should become citizens by birth, it would be
in the power of Congress, at any time, by striking negroes
'out of the naturalization laws, and limiting those laws, as
they were formerly limited, to white persons only, to defeat
the main purpose of the Constitutional Amendment.
The fact, therefore, that acts of Congress or treaties have not
permitted Chinese persons born out of this country to become
citizens by naturalization, cannot exclude Chinese persons
born in this country from the operation of the broad and
clear words of the Constitution, "All persons born in the
United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States."
VII. Upon the facts agreed in this case, the Ainerican citizenship which Wong Kim Ark acquired by birth within the
United States has not been lost or taken away by anything
happening since his birth. No doubt he might himself, after
coming of age, renounce this citizenship, and become a citizen
of the country of his parents, or of any other country; for by
our law, as solemnly declared by Congress, "the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people," and
"any declaration, instruction, opinion, order or direction of
any officer of the United States, which denies, restricts, impairs or questions the right of expatriation, is declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the Republic."
Rev. Stat. § 1999, reenacting act of July 27, 1868, c. 249,
§ 1; 15 Stat. 223, 224. Whether any act of himself, or of his
parents, during his minority, could have the same effect, is at
least doubtful. But it would be out of place to pursue that
inquiry; inasmuch as it is expressly agreed that his residence
has always been in the United States, and not elsewhere;
that each of his temporary visits to China, the one for some
months when he was about seventeen years old, and the other
for something like a year about the time of his coming of age,
was made with the intention of returning, and was followed
by his actual return, to the United States; and "that said
Wong Kim Ark has not, either by himself or his parents act-

ing for him, ever renounced his allegiance to the United
States, and that he has never done or committed any act or
thing to exclude him therefrom."
The evident intention, and the necessary effect, of the submission of this case to the decision of the court upon the facts
agreed by the parties, were to present for determination the
single question, stated at the beginning of this opinion,
namely, whether a child born in the United States, of parents
of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects
of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicil and
residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his
birth a citizen of the United States. For the reasons above
stated, this court is of opinion that the question must be answered in the affirmative.
Order affirmed.

The argument is, that although the Constitution prior to
that amendment nowhere attempted to define the words "citizens of the United States" and "natural-born citizen" as used
therein, yet that it must be interpreted in the light of the
English common law rule which made the place of birth the
criterion of nationality; that that rule "was in force in all

the English colonies upon this continent down to the time
of the Declaration of Independence, and in the United States
afterwards, and continued to prevail under the Constitution as
originally established;" and " that before the enactment of the
Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the adoption of the Constitutional
Amendment, all white persons, at least, born within the sovereignty of the United States, whether children of citizens or of
foreigners, excepting only children of ambassadors or public
ministers of a foreign Government, were native-born citizens
of the United States."
Thus the Fourteenth Amendment is held to be merely declaratory except that it brings all persons, irrespective of color,
within the scope of the alleged rule, and puts that rule beyond
the control of the legislative power.
If the conclusion of the majority opinion is correct, then
the children of citizens of the United States, who have been
born abroad since July 28, 1868, when the amendment was
declared ratified, were, and are, aliens, unless they have, or
shall on attaining majority, become citizens by naturalization
in the United States; and no statutory provision to the contrary is of any force or effect. And children who are aliens
by descent, but born on our soil, are exempted from the exercise of the power to exclude or to expel aliens, or any class of
aliens, so often maintained by this court, an exemption apparently disregarded by the acts in respect of the exclusion of persons of Chinese descent.
The English common law rule, which it is insisted was in
force after the Declaration of Independence, was that "every
person born within the dominions of the Crown, no matter
whether of "English or of foreign parents, and, in the latter
case, whether the parents were settled or merely temporarily
sojourning in the country, was an English subject; save only
the children of foreign ambassadors, (who were excepted because their fathers carried their own nationality with them,)
or a child born to a foreigner during the hostile occupation of
any part of the territories of England." Cockburn on Nationality, 7.
The tie which bound the child to the Crown was indissolu-

ble. The nationality of his parents had no bearing on his
nationality. Though born during a temporary stay of a few
days, the child was irretrievably a British subject. Hall on
Foreign Jurisdiction, etc., § 15.
The rule was the outcome of the connection in feudalism
between the individual and the soil on which he lived, and the
allegiance due was that of liegemen to their liege lord. It
was not local and temporary as was the obedience to the laws
owed by aliens within the dominions of the Crown, but permanent and indissoluble, and not to be cancelled by any
change of time or place or circumstances.
And it is this rule, pure and simple, which it is asserted determined citizenship of the United States during the entire
period prior to the passage of the act of April 9, 1866, and
the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and governed
the meaning of the words "citizen of the United States" and
"natural-born citizen" used in the Constitution as originally
framed and adopted. I submit that no such rule obtained
during the period referred to, and that those words bore no
such construction; that the act of April 9, 1866, expressed the
contrary rule; that the Fourteenth Amendment prescribed
the same rule as the act; and that if that amendment bears
the construction now put upon it, it imposed the English common law rule on this country for the first time and made it
"absolute and unbending," just as Great Britain was being
relieved from its inconveniences.
Obviously, where the Constitution deals with common law
rights and uses common law phraseology, its language should
be read in the light of the common law; but when the question arises as to what constitutes citizenship of the nation,
involving as it does international relations, and political as
contradistinguished from civil status, international principles
must be considered, and, unless the municipal law of England
appears to have been affirmatively accepted, it cannot be
allowed to control in the matter of construction.
Nationality is essentially a political idea, and belongs to the
sphere of public law. Hence Mr. Justice Story, in Shanks v.
Duvont, 3 Pet. 242, 248, said that the incapacities of femes

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.

covert, at common law, "do not reach their political rights,
nor prevent their acquiring or losing a national character.
Those political rights do not stand upon the mere doctrines of
municipal law, applicable to ordinary transactions, but .stand
upon-the more general principles of the law of nations."
Twiss in his work on the Law of Nations says that "natural
allegiance, or the obligation of perpetual obedience to the
government of a country, wherein a man may happen to have
been born, which he cannot forfeit, or cancel, or vary by any
change of time, or place, or circumstance, is the creature of
civil law, and finds no countenance in the law of nations, as it
is in direct conflict with the incontestable rule of that law."
Vol. 1, p. 231.
Before the Revolution, the views of the publicists had been
thus put by Vattel: "The natives, or natural-born citizens,
are those born in the country, of parents who are citizens. As
the society cannot exist and perpetuate itself otherwise than
by the children of the citizens, those children naturally follow
the condition of their fathers, and succeed to all their rights.
The society is supposed to desire this, in consequence of what
it owes to its own preservation; and it is presumed, as matter
of course, that each citizen, on entering into society, reserves
to his children the right of becoming members of it. The
country of the fathers is therefore that of the children; and
these become true citizens merely by their tacit consent. We
shall soon see whether, on their coming to the years of discretion, they may renounce their right, and what they owe to
the society in which they were born. I say that, in order to
be of the country, it is necessary that a person be born of a
father who is a citizen; for, if he is born there of a foreigner,
it will be only the place of his birth, and not his country."
Book I, c. 19, § 212. "The true bond which connects the
child with the body politic is not the matter of an inanimate
piece of land, but the moral relations of his parentage. .
The place of birth produces no change in the rule that children
follow the condition of their fathers, for it is not naturally the
place of birth that gives rights, but extraction."
And to the same effect are the modern writers, as for in-

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Dissenting Opinion; Fuller, C.J., Harlan, J.

stance, Bar, who says: "To what nation a person belongs is
by the laws of all nations closely dependent on descent; it is
almost an universal rule that the citizenship of the parents
determines it- that of the father where children are lawful,
and where they are bastards that of their mother, without
regard to the place of their birth; and that must necessarily
be recognized as the correct canon, since nationality is in its
essence dependent on descent." Int. Law, § 31.
The framers of the Constitution were familiar with the distinctions between the Roman law and the feudal law, between
obligations based on territoriality and those based on the personal and invisible character of origin, and there is nothing
to show that in the matter of nationality they intended to
adhere to principles derived from regal government, which
they had just assisted in overthrowing.
Manifestly, when the sovereignty of the Crown was thrown
off and an independent government established, every rule of
the common law and every statute of England obtaining in
the Colonies, in derogation of the principles on which the
new government was founded, was abrogated.
The States, for all national purposes embraced in the Constitution, became one, united under the same sovereign authority, and governed by the same laws, but they retained
their jurisdiction over all persons and things within their territorial limits, except where surrendered to the General Government or restrained by the Constitution, and protection to
life, liberty and property rested primarily with them. So far
as the jus commune, or folk-right, relating to the rights of
persons, was concerned, the Colonies regarded it as their
birthright, and adopted such parts of it as they found appliT
an .ess v. Pacard,2 Pet. 137.
cable to their condition.
They became sovereign and independent States, and when
the Republic was created each of the thirteen States had its
own local usages, customs and common law, while in respect
of the National Government there necessarily was no general, independent and separate common law of the United
States, nor has there ever been. Wheaton v. Pekrs, 8 Pet.

As to the jura coronw, including therein the obligation of
allegiance, the extent to which these ever were applicable in
this country depended on circumstances, and it would seem
quite clear that the rule making locality of birth the criterion
of citizenship because creating a permanent tie of allegiance,
no more survived the American Revolution than the same rule
survived the French Revolution.
Doubtless, before the latter event, in the progress of
monarchical power, the rule which involved the principle
of liege homage may have become the rule of Europe; but
that idea never had any basis in the United States.
As Chief Justice Taney observed in Flemihg v. Page, 9
How. 603, 618, though in a different connection: "It is true
that most of the States have adopted the principles of English
jurisprudence, so far as it concerns private and individual
rights. And when such rights are in question, we habitually
refer to the English decisions, not only with respect, but in
many cases as authoritative. But in the distribution of political power between the great departments of government,
there is such a wide difference between the power conferred
on the President of the United States and the authority and
sovereignty which belong to the English Crown, that it would
be altogether unsafe to reason from any supposed resemblance
between them, either as regards conquest in war, or any other
subject where the rights and powers of the executive arm of
the government are brought into question. Our own Constitution and form of government must be our only guide."
And Mr. Lawrence, in his edition of Wheaton (Lawrence's
Wheaton, p. 920), makes this comment: "There is, it is believed, as great a difference between the territorial allegiance
claimed by an hereditary sovereign on feudal principles, and
the personal right of citizenship participated in by all the
members of the political community, according to American
institutions, as there is between the authority and sovereignty
of the Queen of England, and the power of the American
President; and the inapplicability of English precedents is as
clear in the one case as in the other. The same view, with
particular application to naturalization, was early taken by

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.J., Harlan, 3.

the American commentator on Blackstone.

Tucker's Black-

stone, Vol. 1, Pt. 2, Appx. p. 96."

Blackstone distinguished allegiance into two sorts, the one
natural and perpetual; the other local and temporary. Natural allegiance, so-called, was allegiance resulting from birth
in subjection to the Crown, and indelibility was an essential,
vital and necessary characteristic.
The Royal Commission to inquire into the Laws of Naturalization and Allegiance was created May 21, 1868; and, in their
report, the Commissioners, among other things, say: "The
allegiance of a natural-born British subject is regarded by the
Common Law as indelible. We are of opinion that this doctrine of the Common Law is neither reasonable nor convenient.
It is at variance with those principles on which the rights and
duties of a subject should be deemed to rest; it conflicts with
that freedom of action which is now recognized as most conducive to the general good as well as to individual happiness
and prosperity; and it is especially inconsistent with the practice of a State which allows to its subjects absolute freedom
of emigration."
However, the Commission by a majority declined to recommend the abandonment of the rule altogether though "clearly
of opinion that it ought not to be, as it now is, absolute and
unbending ;" but recommended certain modifications which
were carried out in subsequent legislation.
But from the Declaration of Independence to this day, the
'United States have rejected the doctrine of indissoluble allegiance and maintained the general right of expatriation, to be
exercised in subordination to the public interests and subject
to regulation.
As early as the act of January 29, 1795, c. 20, 1 Stat. 414,
applicants for naturalization were required to take not simply
an oath to support the Constitution of the 'United States, but
of absolute renunciation and abjuration of all allegiance and
fidelity to every foreign prince or State, and particularly to
the prince or State of which they were before the citizens or
subjects.
The statute 3 Jac. 1, c. 4, provided that promising obedience

Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.J., Harlan, J.

to any other prince, State or potentate subjected the person
so doing to be adjudged a traitor, and to suffer the penalty
of high treason; and in respect of the act of 1795 Lord Grenville wrote to our minister, Rufus King : "No British subject
can, by such a form of renunciation as that which is prescribed
in the American law of naturalization, divest himself of his
allegiance to his sovereign. Such a declaration of renunciation made by any of the King's subjects would, instead of
operating as a protection to them, be considered an act highly
criminal on their part." 2 Amer. St. Pap. 149. And see
.Fitch v. TFeber, 6 iHare, 51.
Nevertheless, Congress has persisted from 1795 in rejecting
the English rule and in requiring the alien, who would become
a citizen of the United States, in taking on himself the ties
binding him to our Government, to affirmatively sever the
ties that bound him to any other.
The subject was examined at length in 1856, in an opinion
given the Secretary of State by Attorney General Cushing,
8 Opins. Attys. Gen. 139, where the views of the writers on
international law and those expressed in cases in the Federal
and state courts are largely set forth, and the Attorney General says : "The doctrine of absolute and perpetual allegiance,
the root of the denial of any right of emigration, is inadmissible
in the United States. It was a matter involved in, and settled
for us by the Revolution, which founded the American Union.
"Moreover, the right of expatriation, under fixed circumstances of time and of manner, being expressly asserted in the
legislatures of several of the States, and confirmed by decisions of their courts, must be considered as thus made a part of
the fundamental law of the United States."
Expatriation included not simply the leaving of one's native
country, but the becoming naturalized in the country adopted
as a future residence. The emigration which the United
States encouraged was that of those who could become incorporate with its people; make its flag their own; and aid in
the accomplishment of a common destiny; and it was obstruction to such emigration that made one of the charges against
the Crown in the Declaration.

AinsZie v. .artin, 9 M1ass. 454, 460, (1813); Murray v.
MoCarty, 2 Munf. 393, (1811); Alsberry v. -Hawkins,9 Dana,
177, (1839) are among the cases cited. In Ainslie v. -Martin,
the indelibility of allegiance according to the common law
rule was maintained; while in .ilurray v. McCarty and Asberry v. Hawkins, the right of expatriation was recognized as
a practical and fundamental doctrine of America. There
was no uniform rule so far as the States were severally concerned, and none such assumed in respect of the United
States.
In 1859, Attorney General Black thus advised the President (9 Op. 356): "The natural right of every free person,
who owes no debts and is not guilty of any crime, to leave
the country of his birth in good faith and for an honest purpose, the privilege of throwing off his natural allegiance and
substituting another allegiance in its place-the general
right, in one word, of expatriation, is incontestable. I know
that the common law of England denies it; that the judicial
decisions of that country are opposed to it; and that-some of
our own courts, misled by British authority, have expressed,
though not very decisively, the same opinion. But all this is
very far from settling the question. The municipal code of
England is not one of the sources from which we derive our
knowledge of international law. We take it from natural
reason and justice, from writers of known wisdom, and from
the practice of civilized nations. All these are opposed to the
doctrine of perpetual allegiance."
In the opinion of the Attorney General, the United States,
in recognizing the right of expatriation, declined, from the
beginning, to accept the view that rested the obligation of
the citizen on feudal principles, and proceeded on the law of
nations, which was in direct conflict therewith.
And the correctness of this conclusion was specifically
affirmed not many years after, when the right as the natural and inherent right of all people and fundamental in this
country, was declared by Congress in the act of July 27, 1868,
15 Stat. 223, c. 249, carried forward into sections 1999 and
2000 of the Revised Statutes, in 1874.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.J., Harlan, J.

It is beyond dispute that the most vital constituent of the
English common law rule has always been rejected in respect
of citizenship of the United States.
Whether it was also the rule at common law that the children of British subjects born abroad were themselves British
subjects -nationality being attributed to parentage instead
of locality -has been variously determined. If this were so,
of course the statute of Edw. III was declaratory, as was the
subsequent legislation. But if not, then such children were
aliens, and the statute of 7 Anne and subsequent statutes
must be regarded as in some sort acts of naturalization. On
the other hand, it seems to me that the rule partus sequitur
patren has always applied to children of our citizens born
abroad and that the acts of Congress on this subject are
clearly declaratory, passed out of abundant caution to obviate
misunderstandings which might arise from the prevalence of
the contrary rule elsewhere.
Section 1993 of the Revised Statutes provides that children
so born "are declared to be citizens of the United States; but
the rights of citizenship shall not descend to children whose
fathers never resided in the United States." Thus a limitation
is prescribed on the passage of citizenship by descent beyond
the second generation if then surrendered by permanent nonresidence, and this limitation was contained in all the acts
from, 1790 down. Section 2172 provides that such children
shall "be considered as citizens thereof."
The language of the statute of 7 Anne, c. 5, is quite different
in providing that, "the children of all natural-born subjects
born out of the ligeance of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, shall be deemed, adjudged and taken to be naturalborn subjects of this kingdom, to all intents, constructions and
purposes whatsoever."
In my judgment, the children of our citizens born abroad
were always natural-born citizens from the standpoint of this
Government. If not, and if the correct view is that they
were aliens but collectively naturalized under the acts of
Congress which recognized them as natural-born, then those
born since the Fourteenth Amendment are not citizens at all,

UNITED STATES v. WONG KRI

ARK.

Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.J., Harlan, J.

unless they have become such by individual compliance with
the general laws for the naturalization of aliens, because they
are not naturalized "in the United States."
By the fifth clause of the first section of article two of the
Constitution it is provided that: "No person except a naturalborn citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of
the adoption of the Constitution, shall be eligible to the office
of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office
who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years,
and been fourteen years a resident within the United States."
In the convention it was, says Mr. Bancroft, "objected that
no number of years could properly prepare a foreigner for
that place; but as men of other lands bad spilled their blood
in the cause of the United States, and had assisted at every
stage of the formation of their institutions, on the seventh of
September, it was unanimously settled that foreign-born residents of fourteen years who should be citizens at the time of
the formation of the Constitution are eligible to the office of
President." 2 Bancroft Hist. U. S. Const. 193.
Considering the circumstances surrounding the framing of
the Constitution, I submit that it is unreasonable to conclude
that "natural-born citizen" applied to everybody born within
the geographical tract known as the United States, irrespective of circumstances; and that the children of foreigners,
happening to be born to them while passing through the
country, whether of royal parentage or not, or whether of the
Mongolian, Malay or other race, were eligible to the Presidency, while children of our citizens, born abroad, were not.
By the second clause of the second section of article one it
is provided that : "No person shall be arepresentative who
shall not have attained to the age of twenty-five years, and
been seven years a citizen of the United States, and who shall
not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State of which he
shall be chosen;" and by the third clause of section three,
that : "No person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen
of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an
inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen."

At that time the theory largely obtained, as stated by Mr.
Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Constitution, "that
every citizen of a State is ipso facto a citizen of the United
States." § 1693.
-Mr.Justice Curtis, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 396,
576, expressed the opinion that under the Constitution of the
United States "every free person born on the soil of a State,
who is a citizen of that State by force of its Constitution or
laws, is also a citizen of the United States." And he said:
"Among the powers unquestionably possessed by the several
States was that of determining, what persons should and what
persons should not be citizens. It was practicable to confer
on the Government of the Union this entire power. It embraced what may, well enough for the purpose now in view, be
divided into three parts. .First: The power to remove the disabilities of alienage, either by special acts in reference to each
individual case, or by establishing a rule of naturalization to be
administered and applied by the courts. Second: Determining
what persons should enjoy the privileges of citizenship, in respect to the internal affairs of the several States. Tldrd: What
native-born persons should be citizens of the United States.
"The first-named power, that of establishing a uniform rule
of naturalization, was granted; and here the grant, according
to its terms, stopped. Construing a Constitution containing
only limited and defined powers of government, the argument
derived from this definite and restricted power to establish
a rule of naturalization must be admitted to be exceedingly
strong. I do not say it is necessarily decisive. It might be
controlled by other parts of the Constitution. But when this
particular subject of citizenship was under consideration, and,
in the clause specially intended to define the extent of power
concerning it, we find a particular part of this entire power
separated from the residue, and conferred on the General
Government, there arises a strong presumption that this is
all which is granted, and that the residue is left to the States
and to the people. And this presumption is, in my opinion,
converted into a certainty, by an examination of all such
other clauses of the Constitution as touch this subject."

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIME ARK.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.J., Harlan, J.

But in that case Mr. Chief Justice Taney said: "The words
'people of the United States' and 'citizens' are synonymous
terms, and mean the same thing. They both describe the political body who, according to our republican institutions, form
the sovereignty, and who hold the power and conduct the government through their representatives. They are what we
familiarly call the 'sovereign people' and every citizen is one
of this people and a constituent member of this sovereignty.
. . .In discussing this question, we must not confound the
rights of citizenship which a State may confer within its own
limits, and the rights of citizenship as a member of the Union.
It does not by any means follow, 'because he has all the rights
and privileges of a citizen of a State, that he must be a citizen
of the United States. Hle may have all of the rights and privileges of a citizen of a State, and yet not be entitled to the
rights and privileges of a citizen in any other State. For, previous to the adoption of the Constitution of the United States,
every State had the undoubted right to confer on whomsoever
it pleased the character of citizen and to endow him with all
its rights. But this character of course was confined to the
boundaries of the State, and gave him no rights or privileges
in other States beyond those secured to him by the laws of
nations and the comity of States. Nor have the several States
surrendered the power of conferring these rights and privileges
by adopting the Constitution of the United States. Each State
may still confer them upon an alien, or any one it thinks
proper, or upon any class or description of persons; yet he
would not be a citizen in the sense in which that word is used
in the Constitution of the United States, nor entitled to sue as
such in one of its courts, nor to the privileges and immunities
of a citizen in the other States. The rights which he would
acquire would be restricted to the State which gave them.
The Constitution has conferred on Congress the right to establish an uniform rule of naturalization, and this right is evidently exclusive, and has always been held by this court to be
so. Consequently, no State, since the adoption of the Constitution, can by naturalizing an alien invest him with 'the rights
and privileges secured to a citizen of a State under the Federal

Government, although, so far as the State alone was concerned,
he would undoubtedly be entitled to the rights of a citizen,
and clothed with all the rights and immunities which the Constitution and laws of the State attached to that character."
Plainly the distinction between citizenship of the United
States and citizenship of a State thus pointed out, involved
then, as now, the complete rights of the citizen internationally
as contradistinguished from those of persons not citizens of
the United States.
The English common law rule recognized no exception in
the instance of birth during the mere temporary or accidental
sojourn of the parents. As allegiance sprang from the place
of birth regardless of parentage and supervened at the moment of birth, the inquiry whether the parents were permanently or only temporarily within the realm was wholly
immaterial. And it is settled in England that the question of
domicil is entirely distinct from that of allegiance. The one
relates to the civil, and the other to the political status.
Udny v. Udny, L. R. 1 H. L. Sc. 441, 457.
But a different view as to the effect of permanent abode on
nationality has been expressed in this country.
In his work on Conflict of Laws, § 48, Mr. Justice StoryV,
treating the subject as one of public law, said: "Persons who
are born in a country are generally deemed to be citizens of that
country. A reasonable qualification of the rule would seem to
be that it should not apply to the children of parents who were
in itinere in the country, or who were abiding there for temporary purposes, as for health or curiosity, or occasional business. It would be difficult, however, to assert that in the
present state of public law such a qualification is universally
established."
Undoubtedly all persons born in a country are presumptively
citizens thereof, but the presumption is not irrebutable.
In his Lectures on Constitutional Law, p. 279, Mr. Justice
Miller remarked: "If a stranger or traveller passing through,
or temporarily residing in this country, who has not himself
been naturalized, and who claims to owe no allegiance to our
Government, has a child born here which goes out of the coun-

UNITED STATES v. WONG KI1Mf ARK.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, 0.J., Harlan, J.

try with its father, such child is not a citizen of the United

States, because it was not subject to its jurisdiction."
And to the same effect are the rulings of Mr. Secretary
Frelinghuysen in the matter of llausding, and Mr. Secretary
Bayard in the matter of Greisser.
Eausding was born in the United States, went to Europe,
and, desiring to return, applied to the minister of the United
States for a passport, which was refused on the ground that
the applicant was born of Saxon subjects temporarily in the
United States. Mr. Secretary Frelinghuysen wrote to Mr.
Kasson, our minister: "You ask 'Can one born a foreign
subject, but within the United States, make the option after
his majority, and while still living abroad, to adopt the citizenship of his birthplace?. It seems not, and that he must
change his allegiance by emigration and legal process of
naturalization.'
Sections 1992 and 1993 of the Revised
Statutes clearly show the extent of existing legislation; that
the fact of birth, under circumstances implying alien subjection, establishes of itself no right of citizenship; and that the
citizenship of a person so born is to be acquired in some.legitimate manner through the operation of statute. iNo statute
contemplates the acquisition of the declared character of an
American citizen by a person not at the time within the jurisdiction of the tribunal of record which confers that character."
Greisser was born in the State of Ohio in 1867, his father
being a German subject and domiciled in Germany, to which
country the child returned. After quoting the act of 1866
and the Fourteenth Amendment, Mr. Secretary Bayard said:
"'Richard Greisser was no doubt born in the United States,
but he was on his birth 'subject to a foreign power,' and 'not
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.' H=e was
not, therefore, under the statute and the Constitution a citizen
of the United States by birth; and it is not pretended that
he has any other title to citizenship." 2 Whart. Int. Dig. 399.
The Civil Rights Act became a law April 9, 1866 (14: Stat. 27,
c. 31), and provided : "That all persons born in the United
States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.3., Harlan, J.

not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United
States." And this was re~nacted June 22, 1874, in the
Revised Statutes, section 1992.
The words "not subject to any foreign power" do not in
themselves refer to mere territorial jurisdiction, for the persons referred to are persons born in the United States. All
such persons are undoubtedly subject to the territorial jarisdiction of the United States, and yet the act concedes that
nevertheless they may be subject to the political jurisdiction
of a foreign government. In other words, by the terms of
the act all persons born in the United States, and not owing
allegiance to any foreign power, are citizens.
The allegiance of children so born is not the local allegiance arising from their parents merely being domiciled in the
country, and it is single and not double allegiance. Indeed
double allegiance in the sense of double nationality has no
place in our law, and the existence of a man without a country is not recognized.
But it is argued that the words "and not subject to any
foreign power" should be construed as excepting from the
operation of the statute only the children of public ministers
and of aliens born during hostile occupation.
Was there any necessity of excepting them? And if there
were others described by the words, why should the language
be construed to exclude them.
Whether the immunity of foreign ministers from local allegiance rests on the fiction of extra-territoriality or on the
waiver of territorial jurisdiction by receiving them as representatives of other sovereignties, the result is the same.
They do not owe allegiance otherwise than to their ofn
governments, and their children cannot be regarded as born
within any other.
And this is true as to the children of aliens within territory
in hostile occupation, who necessarily are not under the protection of, nor bound to render obedience to, the sovereign
whose domains are invaded; but it is not pretended that the
children of citizens of a government so situated would not
become its citizens at their 6birth, as the permanent allegiance

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM* ARK.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.J., Harlan, J.

of their parents would not be severed by the mere fact of the
enemy's possession.
If the act of 1866 had not contained the words, "and not
subject to any foreign power," the children neither of public
ministers nor of aliens in territory in hostile occupation would
have been included within its terms on any proper construction, for their birth would not have subjected them to ties
of allegiance, whether local and temporary, or general and
permanent.
There was no necessity as to them for the insertion of the
words although they were embraced by them.
But there were others in respect of whom the exception
was needed, namely, the children of aliens, whose parents
owed local and temporary allegiance merely, remaining subject to a foreign power by virtue of the tie of permanent
allegiance, which they had not severed by formal abjuration
or equivalent conduct, and some of whom were not permitted
to do so if they would.
And it was to prevent the acquisition of citizenship by the
children of such aliens merely by birth within the geographical limits of the United States that the words were inserted.
Two months after the statute was enacted, on June 16, 1866,
the Fourteenth Amendment was proposed, and declared ratified July 28, 1868. The first clause of the first section reads:
"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and
subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United
States and of the State wherein they reside." The act was
passed and the amendment proposed by the same Congress,
and it is not open to reasonable doubt that the words "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" in the amendment were used
as synonymous with the words "and not subject to any foreign
power" of the act.
The jurists and statesmen referred to in the majority opinion, notably Senators Trumbull and Reverdy Johnson, concurred in that view, Senator Trumbull saying: "What do
we mean by ' subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'?
Not owing allegiance to anybody else; that is what it means."
And Senator Johnson: "Now, all that this amendment proVOL. CLx=x-46

vides is that all persons born within the United States and
not subject to some foreign power -for that no doubt is the
meaning of the committee who have brought the matter before u - shall be considered as citizens of the United States."
Cong. Globe, 1st Sess. 39th Cong., 2893 et seq.
This was distinctly so ruled in Elk v. Wilkins, 112 U. S. 94;
and no reason is perceived why the words were used if they
apply only to that obedience which all persons, not possessing
immunity therefrom, must pay the laws of the country in
which they happen to be.
Dr. Wharton says that the words "subject to the jurisdiction" must be construed in the sense which international law
attributes to them, but that the children of our citizens born
abroad, and of foreigners born in the United States have the
right on arriving at full age to elect one allegiance and repudiate the other. Whart. Conflict of Laws, §§ 10, 11, 12.
The Constitution and statutes do not contemplate double
allegiance, and how can such election be determined? By
section 1993 of the Revised Statutes, the citizenship of the
children of our citizens born abroad may be terminated in
that generation by their persistent abandonment of their
country; while by sections 2167 and 2168, special provision
is made for the naturalization of alien minor residents, on
attaining majority, by dispensing with the previous declaration
of intention and allowing three years of minority on the five
years' residence required; and also for the naturalization of
children of aliens whose parents have died after making declaration of intention. By section 2172 children of naturalized
citizens are to be considered citizens.
While then the naturalization of the father carries with it
that of his minor children, and his declaration of intention
relieves them from the preliminary steps for naturalization,
and minors are allowed to count part of the residence of
their minority on the whole term required and are relieved
from the declaration of intention, the statutes make no provision for formal declaration of election by children born in
this country of alien parents on attaining majority.
The point, however, before us, is whether permanent alle-

giance is imposed at birth without regard to circumstances permanent until thrown off and another allegiance acquired
by formal acts - not local and determined by a mere change
of domicil.
The Fourteenth Amendment came before the court in The
Slaugltterhwuse Oasev, 16 Wall 36, 73, at December term,

1872 (the cases having been brought up by writ of error in
May, 1870, 10 Wall. 273), and it was held that the first clause
was intended to define citizenship of the United States and
citizenship of a State, which definitions recognized the distinction between the one and the other; that the privileges and
immunities of citizens of the States embrace generally those
fundamental civil rights for the security of which organized
society was instituted, and which remain, with certain exceptions mentioned in the Federal Constitution, under the care
of the state governments; while the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States are those which arise out
of the nature and essential character of the National Government, the provisions of its Constitution, or its laws and treaties
made in pursuance thereof; and that it is the latter which
are placed under the protection of Congress by the second
clause.
And Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the opinion of the court,
in analyzing the first clause, observed that "the phrase 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof' was intended to exclude from
its operation children of ministers, consuls and citizens or
subjects of foreign States, born within the United States."
That eminent judge did not have in mind the distinction
between persons charged with diplomatic functions and those
who were not, but was well aware that consuls are usually
the citizens or subjects of the foreign States from which they
come, and that, indeed, the appointment of natives of the
places where the consular service is required, though permissible, has been pronounced objectionable in principle.
His view was that the children of "citizens or subjects of
foreign States," owing permanent allegiance elsewhere and
only local obedience here, are not otherwise subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States than are their parents.

OCTOBER TERIM, 1897.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.J., Harlan, J.

Mr. Justice Field dissented from the judgment of the court,
and subsequently in the case of Look Tin Sing, 10 Sawyer, 353,
in the Circuit Court for the District of California, held children born of Chinese parents in the United States to be citizens, and the cases subsequently decided in the Ninth Circuit
followed that ruling. Hence the conclusion in this case which
the able opinion of the District Judge shows might well have
been otherwise.
I do not insist that, although what was said was deemed
essential to the argument and a necessary part of it, the
point was definitively disposed of in the Slaughterhouse Cases,
particularly as Chief Justice Waite in Minor v. ffappersett,
21 Wall. 162, 167, remarked that there were doubts, which for
the purposes of the case then in hand it was not necessary
to solve. But that solution is furnished in Elk v. Wilkins, 112
IT.S.91, 101, where the subject received great consideration
and it was said:
"By the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution slavery was prohibited. The main object of the opening sentence
of the Fourteenth Amendment was to settle the question,
upon which there had been a difference of opinion throughout the country and in this court, as to the citizenship of free
negroes, Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393; and to put it beyond doubt that all persons, white or black, and whether
formerly slaves or not, born or naturalized in the United
States, and owing no allegiance to any alien yower, should be
citizens of the United States, and of the State in which they
reside. Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 73; Strauder'v.
West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 306.
"This section contemplates two sources of citizenship, and
two sources only: birth and naturalization. The persons declared to be citizens are ' all persons born or naturalized in the
United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' The
evident meaning of these last words is, not merely subject
in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United
States, but completely subject to their political jurisdiction,
and owing them direct and immediate allegiance. And the
words relate to the time of birth in the one case, as they do

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Dissenting Opinion z Fuller, C.J., Harlan, J.

to the time of naturalization in the other. Persons not thus
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at the time of
birth cannot become so afterwards, except by being naturalized, either individually, as by proceedings under the naturalization acts, or collectively, as by the force of a treaty by
which foreign territory is acquired."
To be "completely subject" to the political jurisdiction of
the United States is to be in no respect or degree subject to
the political jurisdiction of any other government.
Now I take it that the children of aliens, whose parents
have not only not renounced their allegiance to their native
country, but are forbidden by its system of government, as
well as by its positive laws, from doing so, and are not permitted to acquire another citizenship by the laws of the country into which they come, must necessarily remain themselves
subject to the same sovereignty as their parents, and cannot,
in the nature of things, be, any more than their parents, completely subject to the jurisdiction of such other country.
Generally speaking, I understand the subjects of the Emperor of China- that ancient Empire, with its history of
thousands of years and its unbroken continuity in belief, traditions and government, in spite of revolutions and changes
of dynasty- to be bound to him by every conception of duty
and by every principle of their religion, of which filial piety
is the first and greatest commandment; and formerly, perhaps still, their penal laws denounced the severest penalties
on those who renounced their country and allegiance, and
their abettors; and, in effect, held the relatives at home of
Chinese in foreign lands as hostages for their loyalty." And
I The fundamental laws of China have remained practically unchanged
since the second century before Christ. The statutes have from time to
time undergone modifications, but there does not seem to be any English or
French translation of the Chinese Penal Code later than that by Staunton,
published in 1810. That code provided: "1All persons renouncing their
country and allegiance, or devising the means thereof, shall be beheaded;
and in the punishment of this offence, no distinction shall be made between
principals and accessories. The property of all such criminals shall be confiscated, and their wives and children distributed as slaves to the great
offlders of State. . . . The parents, grandparents, brothers and grand-

whatever concession may have been made by treaty in the
direction of admitting the right of expatriation in some sense,
they seem in the United States to have remained pilgrims and
sojourners as all their fathers were. 149 U. S. 717. At all
events, they have never been allowed by our laws to acquire
our nationality, and, except in sporadic instances, do not appear ever to have desired to do so.
The Fourteenth Amendment was not designed to accord
citizenship to persons so situated and to cut off the legislative
power from dealing with the subject.
The right of a nation to expel or deport foreigners who have
not been naturalized or taken any steps toward becoming citizens of a country, is as absolute and unqualified as the right
to prohibit and prevent their entrance into the country. 149
U. S. '707.
iBut can the persons expelled be subjected to "cruel and
unusual punishments" in the process of expulsion, as would
be the case if children born to them in this country were
separated from them on their departure, because citizens of
the United States? Was it intended by this amendment to
tear up parental relations by the roots?
The Fifteenth Amendment provides that "the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged
by the United States or by any State on account of race, color
or previous condition of servitude." Was it intended thereby
that children of aliens should, by virtue of being born in the
children of such criminals, whether habitually living with them under the
same roof or not, shall be perpetually banished to the distance of 2000 lee.
"All those who purposely conceal and connive at the perpetration of this
crime, shall be strangled. Those who inform against, and bring to justice,
criminals of this description, shall be rewarded with the whole of their
property.
"Those who are privy to the perpetration of this crime, and yet omit to
give any notice or information thereof to the magistrates, shall be punished

United States, be entitled on attaining majority to vote irrespective of the treaties and laws of the United States in regard
to such aliens?
In providing that persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens, the
Fourteenth Amendment undoubtedly had particular reference
to securing citizenship to the members of the colored race,
whose servile status had been obliterated by the Thirteenth
Amendment, and who had been born in the United States,
but were not and never had been subject to any foreign
power. They were not aliens, (and even if they could be so
regarded, this operated as a collective naturalization,) and their
political status could not be affected by any change of the
laws for the naturalization of individuals.
.Nobody can deny that the question of citizenship in a
nation is of the most vital importance. It is a precious heritage, as well as an inestimable acquisition ; and I cannot think
that any safeguard surrounding it was intended to be thrown
down by the amendment.
In suggesting some of the privileges and immunities of
national citizenship, in the Slaughterhouse Cases Mr. Justice
Miller said: "Another privilege of a citizen of the United
States is to demand the care and protection of the Federal
Government over his life, liberty and property when on the
high seas or within the jurisdiction of a foreign government.
Of this there can be no doubt, nor that the right depends
upon his character as a citizen of the United States."
Mr. Hall says in his work on Foreign Jurisdiction, etc.,
§ 2, 5, the principle is that "the legal relations by which a person is encompassed in his country of birth and residence cannot be wholly put aside when he goes abroad for a time; many
of the acts which he may do outside his native state have inevitable consequences within it. He may for many purposes
be temporarily under the control of another sovereign than
his own, and he may be bound to yield to a foreign government a large measure of obedience; but his own State still
possesses a right to his allegiance; he is still an integral part
of the national community. A State therefore can enact laws,

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.J., Harlan, J.

enjoining or forbidding acts, and defining legal relations,
which apply to its subjects abroad in common with those
within its dominions. It can declare under what conditions
it will regard as valid, acts done in foreign countries, which
profess to have legal effect; it can visit others with penalties;
it can estimate circumstances and facts as it chooses." On the
other hand, the "duty of protection is correlative to the rights
of a sovereign over his subjects; the maintenance of a bond
between a State and its subjects while they are abroad implies
that the former must watch over and protect them within the
due limit of the rights of other States.

.

.

.

It enables

governments to exact reparation for oppression from which
their subjects have suffered, or for injuries done to them
otherwise than by process of law; and it gives the means of
guarding them against the effect of unreasonable laws, of laws
totally out of harmony with the nature or degree of civilization by which a foreign power affects to be characterized, and
finally of an administration of the laws had beyond a certain
point. When in these directions a State grossly fails in its
duties; when it is either incapable of ruling, or rules with
patent injustice, the right of protection emerges in the form
of diplomatic remonstrance, and in extreme cases of ulterior
measures. It provides a material sanction for rights; it does
not offer a theoretic foundation. It does not act within a
foreign territory with the consent of the sovereign; it acts
against him contentiously from without."
The privileges or immunities which, by the second clause
of the amendment, the States are forbidden to abridge are
the privileges or immunities pertaining to citizenship of the
United States, but that clause also places an inhibition on the
States from depriving any person of life, liberty or property,
and from denying "to any person within its jurisdiction, the
equal protection of the laws," that is, of its own laws - the
laws to which its own citizens are subjected.
The jurisdiction of the State is necessarily local, and the
limitation relates to rights primarily secured by the States
and not by the United States. Jurisdiction as applied to the
General Government embraces international relations; as ap-

UNITED STATES v. WONG KIM ARK.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.J., Harlan, J.

plied to the State, it refers simply to its power over persons
and things within its particular limits.
These considerations lead to the conclusion that the rule in
respect of citizenship of the United States prior to the Fourteenth Amendment differed from the English common law
rule in vital particulars, and, among others, in that it did not
recognize allegiance as indelible, and in that it did recognize
an essential difference between birth during temporary, and
birth during permanent, residence. If children born in the
United States were deemed presumptively and generally citizens, this was not so when they were born of aliens whose
residence was merely temporary, either in fact, or in point of
law.
Did the Fourteenth Amendment impose the original English common law rule as a rigid rule on this country?
Did the amendment operate to abridge the treaty-making
power, or the power to establish an uniform rule of naturalization?
I insist that it cannot be maintained that this Government
is unable through the action of the President, concurred in by
the Senate, to make a treaty with a foreign government providing that the subjects of that government, although allowed
to enter the United States, shall not be made citizens thereof,
and that their children shall not become such citizens by reason of being born therein.
A treaty couched in those precise terms would not be incompatible with the Fourteenth Amendment, unless it be held
that that amendment has abridged the treaty-making power.
Nor would a naturalization law excepting persons of a certain race and their children be invalid, unless the amendment
has abridged the power of naturalization. This cannot apply
to our colored fellow-citizens, who never were aliens - were
never beyond the jurisdiction of the United States.
"Born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof," and "naturalized in the United States, and subject
to the jurisdiction thereof," mean born or naturalized under
such circumstances as to be completely subject to that jurisdiction, that is, as completely-as citizens of the United States,

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, 0.3., Harlan, J.

who are of course not subject to any foreign power, and can
of right claim the exercise of the power of the United States on
their behalf wherever they may be.

When, then, children are

born in the United States to the subjects of a foreign power,
with which it is agreed by treaty that they shall not be naturalized thereby, and as to whom our own law forbids them to
be naturalized, such children are not born so subject to the
jurisdiction as to become citizens, and entitled on that ground
to the interposition of our Government, if they happen to be
found in the country of their parents' origin and allegiance, or
any other.
Turning to the treaty between the United States and China,
concluded July 28, 1868, the ratifications of which were exchanged November 23, 1869, and the proclamation made February 5, 1870, we find that, by its sixth article, it was provided: "Citizens of the United States visiting or residing in
China shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities or exemptions in respect of travel or residence as may there be enjoyed
by the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation. And,
reciprocally, Chinese subjects residing in the United States
shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities and exemptions in
respect to travel or residence as may there be enjoyed by the
citizens or subjects of the most favored nation. But nothing
herein contained shall be heldoto confer naturalization on the
citizens of the United States in China, nor upon the subjects
of China in the United States."
It is true that in the fifth article, the inherent right of man
to change his home or allegiance was recognized, as well as
"the mutual advantage of the free migration and emigration
of their citizens and subjects, respectively, from the one country to the other, for the purposes of curiosity, of traffic, or as
permanent residents."
All this, however, had reference to an entirely voluntary
emigration for these purposes, and did not involve an admission of change of allegiance unless both countries assented,
but the contrary according to the sixth article.
By the convention of March 17, 1894, it was agreed "that
Chinese laborers or Chinese of any other class, either perma-

UNITE D STATES v. WONG KIM AR1K.
Dissenting Opinion: Fuller, C.3., Harlan, J.

nently or temporarily residing within the United States, shall
have for the protection of their persons and property all rights
that are given by the laws of the United States to citizens of
the most favored nation, excepting the right to become naturalized citizens."
These treaties show that neither Government desired such
change nor assented thereto. Indeed, if the naturalization
laws of the United States had provided for the naturalization
of Chinese persons, China manifestly would not have been
obliged to recognize that her subjects had changed their allegiance thereby. But our laws do not so provide, and, on the
contrary, are in entire harmony with the treaties.
I think it follows that the children of Chinese born in this
country do not, ipsofacto, become citizens of the United States
unless the Fourteenth Amendment overrides both treaty and
statute. Does it bear that construction; or rather is it not
the proper constructidn that all persons born in the Uited
States of parents permanently residing here and susceptible
of becoming citizens, and not prevented therefrom by treaty
or statute, are citizens, and not otherwise?
But the Chinese under their form of government, the treaties and statutes, cannot become citizens nor acquire a permanent home here, no matter what the length of their stay may
be. Wharton Confl. Laws, § 12.
In .Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 717, it
was said in respect of the treaty of 1868: "After some years'
experience under that treaty, the Government of the United
States was brought to the opinion that the presence within
our territory of large numbers of Chinese laborers, of a distinct race and religion, remaining strangers in the land, residing apart by themselves, tenaciously adhering to the customs
and usages of their own country, unfamiliar with our institutions, and apparently incapable of assimilating with our people, might endanger good order, and be injurious to the public
interests; and therefore requested and obtained from China a
modification of the treaty."
It is not to be admitted that the children of persons so situated become citizens by the accident of birth. On the con-

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.

trary, I am of opinion that the President and Senate by treaty,
and the Congress by naturalization, have the power, notwithstanding the Fourteenth Amendment, to prescribe that all
persons of a particular race, or their children, cannot become
citizens, and that it results that the consent to allow such persons to come into and reside within our geographical limits
does not carry with it the imposition of citizenship upon children born to them while in this country under such consent,
in spite of treaty and statute.
In other words, the Fourteenth Amendment does not exclude from citizenship by birth children born in the United
States of parents permanently located therein, and who might
themselves become citizens; nor, on the other hand, does it
arbitrarily make citizens of children born in the United States
of parents who, according to the will of their native government and of this Government, are and must remain aliens.
Tested by this rule, Wong Kim Arli never became and is
not a citiz'n of the United States, and the order of the District
Court should be reversed.
I am authorized to say that MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concurs in
this dissent.

M . JUSTICE McKENNA, not having been a member of the
court when this case was argued, took no part in the decision.
