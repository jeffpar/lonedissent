195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

any remedy through a deed she might have had. But, reading
the act, as the view of the Supreme Court compels us to do,
as taking away her right to maintain her possession, we are
of opinion that it materially impairs the obligation of her
contract, and deprives her of property without due process.
Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME

No. 2.

COURT OF THE STATE

OF ILLINOIS.

No. 306. Argued April 21, 1904.-Decided May 31, 1904.

This case having been decided by the state court on the authority of its own
decision in a case between the same parties which has been reversed by
this court, this judgment is also reversed on the authority of Bradley v.
Lightcap, ante, p. 1.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Mr. John S. Miller, with whom Mr. Merritt Starr and
Mr. W. W. Hammond were on the brief, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. George W. Wall and Mr. E. A. Wallace, with whom
Mr. Lyman Lacey, Jr., was on the brief, for defendant in
error.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER

delivered the opinion of the court.

After the decision reported 186 Illinois, 510, Mrs. Bradley
filed her bill in equity in the Circuit Court of Fulton County,
Illinois, to quiet her title to the land in controversy in the
action in ejectment and for appropriate relief. The bill was
dismissed on demurrer and Mrs. Bradley carried the case to
the Supreme Court of Illinois, which affirmed the decree below.

195 U.,S.

Opinion of the Court.

Bradley v. Lightcap, 202 Illinois, 154, April 24, 1903. Three
of the members of the court dissented. The opinion of the
Supreme Court proceeded on the strength of the decisions in
186 Illinois, 510, and 201 Illinois, 511.
As we have reversed the judgment in the prior case, this
case must take the same course.
Decree reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with our opinion in No. 243.
