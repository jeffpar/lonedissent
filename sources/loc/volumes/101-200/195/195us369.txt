upon no sound principle; and the fact that Congress, under
the Constitution, cannot extend our admiralty jurisdiction,
affords an argument for a broad interpretation commensurate
with the needs of modern commerce. To attempt to draw
the line of jurisdiction between different kinds of fixed structures, as, for instance, between beacons and wharves, would
lead to great confusion and much further litigation.

CITIZENS' NATIONAL BANK OF KANSAS CITY v.
DONNELL.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 36. Argued November 1, 1904.-Decided November 28, 1904.

Under §§ 5197, 5198, U. S. Rev. Stat., a national bank which compounds
interest in a manner prohibited by the State forfeits all interest even
though the total interest amounts to less than the maximum rate permitted by the State.
A national bank, met in an action by the plea of usury, may not avoid the
forfeiture of all interest by then declaring an election to remit the excessive interest.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Oliver H. Dean, with whom Mr. William D. McLeod
and Mr. Hale Holden were on the brief, for plaintif in error:
The national banking act authorizes the taking of the
highest rate allowed by the State. The State allowed eight
per cent and the bank never took over seven and a half per
cent. The interest on the overdraft at twelve per cent only
amounted to $14.51 and the principle of de minimis applies.
The question of what is compound interest is one for the 6ourt.
The method of business to be pursued by a national bank
cannot be prescribed by a state statute; it rests upon higher
authority. Tyler on Usury, 244.

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri on
the ground that the plaintiff in error is denied the rights with
regard to charging interest conferred upon it by the national
banking act. Rev. Stat. §§ 5197, 5198. The suit was brought
by the plaintiff in error upon a promissory note for twenty
thousand dollars, with interest at eight per cent, made on
April 29, 1892. The facts, shortly stated, are as follows: On
October 29, 1892, the plaintiff bought the defendant's note
for $15,000, with interest at seven per cent. On July 12, 1895,
the defendant being behindhand with his payments of interest
and also having overdrawn a bank account which he kept in
the plaintiff's bank, he gave the plaintiff a new note for $17,500,
and interest at seven per cent, in satisfaction of both liabilities.
The amount of this note included three semi-annual interest
charges, of $525 each, with a few days' further interest, on the
former note, with interest on this interest from the time it was
due, and charges of one per cent or more a month on the
amount overdrawn each month. It left the defendant with
a credit on his bank account of $230.50. On April 29, 1896,
the note in suit and another note for $2,000 were given in
satisfaction of the last note for $17,500, and of another note
for $2,500, of October 1, 1895, with interest accrued on both,
and of an overdraft of $919.90, and a balance of $2.42. The
overdraft item included, as before, charges of about one per
cent a month on the amounts actually overdrawn.
The Supreme Court of Missouri held that the plaintiff must
forfeit all interest from the beginning of the above transactions, and could recover only the original fifteen thousand

dollars, the actual overdraft on July 12, 1895, four hundred
and seventy-four dollars and twenty-four cents, the bank
credit of two hundred and thirty dollars given the same day,
the note of October 1, 1895, for twenty-five hundred dollars,
the overdraft on April 25, 1896, of eight hundred and seventyfour dollars and eighty-one cents and the bank credit of two
dollars and forty-two cents-in all, nineteen thousand eightyone dollars and ninety-seven cents, less fifty-five hundred
dollars collected on account since the action was begun. 172
Missouri, 384.
By the United States Rev. Stat. § 5197, a bank may charge
"interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the State,
where the bank is located, and no more." By § 5198 taking,
receiving, or charging "a rate of interest greater than is allowed
by the preceding section, when knowingly done, shall be deemed
a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note, bill, or other
evidence of debt carries with it, or which has been agreed to
be paid thereon." The Revised Statutes of Missouri fix six
per cent as the rate of interest in the absence of agreement,
§ 3705, but allow parties to agree in writing for not over eight
per cent. § 3706. They also allow parties to contract in
writing for the payment of interest upon interest, "but the
interest shall not be compounded oftener than once in a year,"
§ 3711. It will be seen that the charge on the overdrafts went
beyond §3706, and the compounding of the semi-annual interest on the notes encountered § 3711.
The plaintiff in error denies that the prohibition of compounding oftener than once a year affects the "rate of interest" within the meaning of those words in U. S. Rev. Stat.
§ 5198, and contends that so long as the total sums received
would not amount to more than eight per cent on the debt,
it has a right to charge them under U. S. Rev. Stat. § 5197,
coupled with Missouri Rev. Stat. § 3706. It disposes of the
twelve per cent charge on overdrafts by the suggestion that
the amount is trifling and de minimis non curat lex, and that
this charge was a penalty because of a failure t6 pay a debt

when due, and therefore not usurious. We are of a different
opinion. The rate of interest which a man receives is greater
when he is allowed to compound than when he is not, the
other elements in the case being the same. Even if the compounded interest is less than might be charged directly without compounding, a statute may forbid enlarging the rate in
that way, whatever may be the rules of the common law.
The Supreme Court of Missouri holds that that is what the
Missouri statute has done. On that point and on the question
whether what was done amounted to compounding within the
meaning of the Missouri statute, we follow the state court.
Union National Bank v. Louisville, New Albany & Chicago
Ry., 163 U. S. 325, 331. Therefore, since the interest charged
and received by the plaintiff was compounded more than once
a year it was at a rate greater than was allowed by U. S. Rev.
Stat. §5197, and it was forfeited. The suggestions as to the
twelve per cent charge on overdrafts do not seem to us to
need answer.
There is no doubt, of course, that the court could go behind
the face of the present note and analyze the sum which it
represents into its original elements. Brown v. Marion National Bank, 169 U. S. 416; Haseltine v. Central Bank, No. 2,
183 U. S. 132, 135, 136. These cases sufficiently show also,
if more is wanted than the words of Rev. Stat. § 5198, that
the court below did not err in forfeiting all the interest from
the beginning.
We perceive no warrant in the statute or the cases for the
contention that the bank, when it brings the action and is met
by the plea of usury, may avoid the forfeiture imposed by
Rev. Stat. § 5198, in absolute terms, by then declaring an
election to remit the excessive interest.
Judgment affirmed.
