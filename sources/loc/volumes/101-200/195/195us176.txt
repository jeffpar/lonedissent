show an offense. It was not the assertion of any particular
right under the Constitution, or under any treaty, or under
an act of Congress, which would be denied to him, if the prosecution was sustained. His contention was only that he was
not subject to criminal prosecution by reason of anything
set forth in the indictment. The indictment was plainly sufficient under the statute prescribing the offense charged, and
the objections to it were too indefinite to meet the requirements of the act of 1900, and make the case one which, by
that act, could be brought to this court for review. Unless
the case was one in which the judgment could be reviewed
here, then such judgment would be final and not subject to
review; for no case determined in the United States court for
Porto Rico can be carried to a Circuit Court of Appeals. We
said, in Royal Ins. Co. v. Martin, 192 U. S. 149, 160, that
"Congress did not intend that any connection should exist
between the United States court for Porto Rico and any Circuit Court of Appeals established under the act of 1891."
The writ of error must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction
in this court, and
It is so ordered.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

change of intent of the legislative body from that expressed in the former
statute.
While punctuation may shed some light on the construction of statutes, so
little is it a part thereof that courts will read the statutes with such
stops as will give effect to the whole. .
The language of paragraph 4 of section 17 of the bankruptcy act of 1898 is
different from that of section 33 of the act of 1867 and the words "fiduciary capacity" extend back to and qualify the words "fraud, embezzlement and misappropriation," and an unliquidated claim of a principal
against his broker for fraudulently selling stocks carried on margin is not
within.the exception of section 17 but is a provable debt and is barred
by the discharge in bankruptcy.
A debt, originating or founded-upon an open account or upon a contract
express or implied, is provable against the bankrupt's estate, though the
creditor may have elected to bring his action in trover as for a fraudulent
conversion instead of in assumpsit upon an open account.

THIs was an action in trover instituted September 10, 1897,
in the Circuit Court of Cook County) Illinois, by Burke against
Crawford & Valentine, plaintiffs in error, to recover damages
for the willful and fraudulent conversion of certain reversionary interests of the plaintiff in 550 shares of Metropolitan
Traction stock.
There were ten counts in the declaration. In each of the
first five counts it was alleged that the defendant firm of
Crawford & Valentine were stock brokers and dealers in investment securities; that plaintiff employed the defendants
as his brokers and agents to buy, hold and carry stocks for
him subject to his order; that defendants had in their possession, or under their control, certain shares of the capital stock
of the Metropolitan Traction Company, which they were holding as a pledge and security for the amount due them from
the plaintiff on said stock; that defendants wrongfully, *illfully and fraudulently, and without his knowledge or consent,
sold said shares of stock, and willfully and fraudulently, and
with intent to cheat and defraud the plaintiff, converted plaintiff's reversionary interest in said stock to their use, whereby
it was wholly lost.
In each of the last five counts it was alleged that after defendants had wrongfully and fraudulently, and without plainVOL. oxv-12

tiff's knowledge or consent, sold the plaintiff's stock and converted the proceeds of such sales to their own use, they falsely
and fraudulently represented to him that they still had the
stock on hand and were carrying it for him; that their correspondents in Philadelphia, where the stock had been bought,
were calling upon them for further demands or margins, and
that it therefore became necessary to call upon the plaintiff
to make further payments on the stock in order to comply
with their correspondents' demands and to be secured against
loss. It was averred in each of said counts that such representations were false and fraudulent, and by means thereof
defendants obtained from the plaintiff the aggregate sum of
$10,800.
To this declaration defendants pleaded not guilty, upon
which issue was joined January 4, 1900, and on May 12, 1900,
a jury trial was waived in writing. The case rested without
action until January 3, 1901, when defendants filed their
separate pleas of puis darrein continuance, setting up that on
April 5, 1900, the defendants had received their discharge in
bankruptcy, in the District Court for the Northern District
of Illinois, and that plaintiff's claims were provable and not
excepted from the operation of such discharge. The plaintiff
replied denying that his claim was provable, and averred that
the same was excepted from such operation.
Notwithstanding the plea of puis darrein continuance, the
plaintiff introduced evidence and proved the allegations in
his declaration and the amount of damages he had sustained.
Defendants were found guilty upon all the counts and judgment entered against them.
The case was taken to the appellate court, where it appearing that one of the justices had taken part in the trial of the
case below, and that the two remaining justices were unable
to agree upon the case, the judgment of the Circuit Court was
affirmed. The judgment of the appellate court was also
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Illinois, 201 Illinois, 581,
to review which judgment this writ of error was sued out.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

Mr. Charles E. Vroman and Mr. George Packard,with whom
Mr. HarrisonMusgrave was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The claim of defendant in error is a provable debt in bankruptcy unaer the bankruptcy act of 1898. Bankruptcy Act,

Being a provable debt, the claim is of such a character that
it is barred by the discharge in bankruptcy of plaintiffs in
error, it not being within any of the exceptions of section 17
of the bankruptcy act. (1.) As stock-brokers, or factors, plaintiffs in error were not "acting in a fiduciary capacity." Chapman v. Forsyth, 2 How. 202; Neal v. Scroggs, 95 U. S. 704;

Bracken v. Milner, 104 Fed. Rep. 522.
The clause "fraud," etc., used in subdivision tour of sction 17, is limited and restricted by the qualifying clause
"while acting in a fiduciary capacity." There being no fiduciary relation between the parties, the debt is not within the
exception, and hence is barred. In re Rhutassel, 96 Fed. Rep.

N. Y. Supp. 1048; Allen v. Ferguson, 85 U. S. 1.
"Fraud," as used in the act, means positive fraud, involving moral turpitude-not constructive fraud, or fraud in law.
Conversion by one in lawful possession of property is not
"fraud" within the meaning of the bankruptcy act. Hence
the claim of defendant in error does not fall within the meaning of the term "fraud" as there used. And on this point
the entire evidence is properly before the court on the plea
puis and the replication thereto. Chitty on Pleadings, 246;

The case made by defendant in error shows that there was'
no fraudulent intent or positive fraud on the part of plaintiffs
in error, and that the relations between the parties were purely
contractual and therefore not responsive to the counts either
for conversion or deceit. Markham v. Jourdain,41 N. Y. 239;

The evidence shows that the transactions out of which the
claim of defendant in error arises were of a gambling character
and illegal and void at common law and under the statute.
The court may, at any stage, when it appears that the matter
involved is forbidden by public policy, or is against public
morality, decline to consider a claim so founded, regardless
of the pleadings. Lyon v. Culbertson, 83 Illinois, 38; Soby v.

Mr. John E. Burke in person for defendant in error:
The claims of defendant in error were claims for unliquidated
damages arising out" of torts; they were claims for damages
occasioned by positive fraud; they were not provable in bankruptcy, and therefore were not barred by the discharge of
plaintiffs in error.
As to the proof of debts under the provisions of the act of
1898, paragraph a of § 63 classifies all claims or "debts which.
may be proved," while paragraph b provides for the precedent
liquidation of such unliquidated claims only as come within
the provisions of paragraph a, and, thereafter, for the proof
and allowance of such claims.
Claims for unliquidated damages arising out of tort do not
come within any of the provisions of paragraph a, and hence
are not provable. Collier on Bankruptcy, 1900, 385; Lowell
on Bankruptcy, 487; In re Yates, 114 Fed. Rep. 365; In re Big
Meadows Co., 7 Am. Bank. Rep. 697; Old Colony Boot & Shoe
Co. v. Parker,183 Massachusetts, 557, 561; Watertown Carriage
Co. v. Hall, 77 N. Y. Supp. 1028.
The claims of the defendant in error were for unliquidated
damages arising out of tort, and did not come within any of

195 U. S.

the provisions of paragraph a. Under Dunbarv. Dunbar, 190
U. S. 340, such claims cannot be liquidated or proved under
the provisions of paragraph b.
As to waiving the tort and effect in bankruptcy, see Bixby
v. United States, 188 U. S. 405; Williamson v. Dickens, 27 N. Car.
259; Hughes v. Oliver, 8 Pa. St. 426; Graham v. C. M. & St. P.
Ry. Co., 10 N. W. Rep. 609; Bradner v. Strang, 89 N. Y. 299,
306.
A claim which could not be liquidated and proved under
the act of 1867 certainly cannot be liquidated and proved
under the act of 1898. Defendant in error did not file any
claim with the receiver or receive any dividend.
While the record does not show that the state Supreme
Court passed upon the question as to whether the claims of
plaintiff in error were provable, yet, the question appears of
record, and was raised and argued in each of the courts below, and calls into exercise the jurisdiction of this court.
The question is involved in the main question: Was the discharge in bankruptcy of plaintiffs in error a bar to the claims
in controversy? If the claims were not provable, the discharge was not a bar, and the judgment should be affirmed.
Collier v. Stanbrough, 6 How. 21; Dewey v. Des Moines, 173
U. S. 197, 198; Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 636.
The qualifying clause in subdivision 4 of § 17 of the act
of 1898, "while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity," refers, both grammatically and logically, to its next
antecedent only, which is the term "defalcation," and does
not apply to or restrict the terms "fraud" or "embezzlement."

v. Payne, 1 N. E. Rep. 20; Joy v. St. Louis, 138 U. S. 1, 32.
It cannot be held that the clause applies to some classes
of debts created by positive fraud, but not to all. It has no
other or different meaning or -application in the act of 1898
than it had in the acts of 1841 and 1867. Under the act of
1867 it was never held that "while acting in any fiduciary
character" applied to or restricted the term "fraud."
Neither does it restrict the term "embezzlement," which is
a specific term and imports the violation of a trust. Moore

Section 33 of the act of 1867, was substantially a reenactment of the act of 1841, in that regard, with the additional
provision that no debt created by fraud or embezzlement
shall be discharged. See Noble v. Hammond, 129 U. S. 65, 69.
As to the construction to be given to § 33 of the act of 1867,

114 U. S. 555; Ames v. Moir, 138 U. S. 306; Forsyth v. Vehmeyer, 177 U. S. 177, holding that a discharge in bankruptcy
did not release a bankrupt from debts or claims which were
created by his positive fraud involving moral turpitude or
intentional wrong, while not acting as an officer or in any
fiduciary capacity at the time he committed the fraud.

CRAWFORD v. BURKE.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

It has been repeatedly declared by the highest courts of both
countries that bankrupt laws are enacted with the object and
intention of relieving honest men, but not rascals, from the
burden of their debts. In re Silverman, 22 Fed. Cas. 139;
Cong. Rec. June 28, 1898; Re Dow's Estate, 105 Fed. Rep. 889;

Dister v. McCauley, 71 N. Y. Supp. 949; Tinker v. Colwell,
193 U. S. 473.
MR. JUSTICE B oWN, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

A year after this case was put at issue, and upon the opening
of the trial, defendants filed their separate pleas puis darrein
continuance, setting up their discharge in bankruptcy, and
averring that plaintiff's claim was a provable debt, and the
discharge a complete defense.
It is a well-settled principle of law, and was so held by the
Supreme Court of Illinois in this case, that a plea puis darrein
continuance waives all prior pleas, and amounts to an admission of the cause of the. action set up in the plaintiff's declaration. Mount v. Scholes, 120 Illinois, 394; East St. Louis v.
Renshaw, 153 Illinois, 491; Angus v. Trust & Savings Bank,
'170 Illinois, 298; Kimball v. Huntington, 10 Wendell, 675.
But notwithstanding this, plaintiff was permitted to introduce evidence in proof of the fraud alleged in his declaration;
and upon the conclusion of the trial the court found there had
been a conversion of plaintiff's reversionary interest in the
stock, for which he "had a right to recover in trover," and
that it was not such a debt as was barred by the bankruptcy
act. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court it was held that it
was not necessary to the judgment to decide whether the allegations of the declaration were admitted by the pleadings,
as they were established by the proof which had been adduced

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

by plaintiff, "and the propositions held as law on that branch
of the case being correct, judgment for plaintiff necessarily follows." That court also held that the case, being one of fraud,
was not covered by the defendants' discharge in bankruptcy.
The only Federal question involved in the case is whether
the Supreme Court of Illinois gave the proper effect to the
discharge pleaded by the defendants. If plaintiff's claim was
not a provable debt, or was expressly excepted from the operation of the discharge, the decision of that court was right, but
if it was covered by the discharge such discharge was a complete defense.
Section 17 of the bankruptcy act of 1898 contains, among
other things, the following provisions:
"SEC. 17. A discharge in bankruptcy shall release the bank-

rupt from all of his provable debts except such as
(2) are judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property
by false pretences, or false representations, or for wilful and
malicious injuries to the property or person of another
or (4) were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer, or in any
fiduciary capacity."
Under this section, whether the discharge of the defendants
in bankruptcy shall operate as a discharge of plaintiff's debt,
it not having been reduced to judgment, depends upon the
fact whether that debt was "provable" under the bankruptcy act, that is, susceptible of being proved; second, whether
it was or was not created by defendants' fraud, embezzlement,
misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer or
in any fiduciary capacity.
1. Provable debts are defined by section 63, a copy of which
appears in the margin.' Paragraph a of this section includes
' SEC. 63. DEBTs WHICH MAY BE PROVED.-(a) Debts of the bankrupt
may be proved and allowed against his estate which are (1) a fixed liability,
as evidenced by a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing
at the time of the filing of the petition against him, whether then payable
or not, with any interest thereon which would have been recoverable at that

Opinion of the Court.

debts arising upon contracts, express or implied, and open accounts, as well as for judgments and costs. As to paragraph b,
two constructions are possible: It may relate to all unliquidated
demands or only to such as may arise upon such contracts,
express or implied, as are covered by paragraph a.
Certainly paragraph b does not embrace debts of an unliquidated character and which in their nature are Aot susceptible of being liquidated. Dunbar v. Dunbar, 190 U. S.
340, 350. Whether the. effect of paragraph b is to cause an
unliquidated claim which is susceptible of liquidation but is
not literally embraced by paragraph a, to be provable in
bankruptcy, we are not called upon to decide, as we are clear
that the debt of the plaintiff was embraced within the provision of paragraph a, as one "founded upon an open account,
or upon a contract, express or implied," and might have been
proved under section 63a had plaintiff chosen to waive the
tort, and take his place with the other creditors of the estate.
He did not elect to do this, however, but brought an action
of trover, setting up a fraudulent conversion of his property
by defendants. In the first five counts of his declaration he
charges a fraudulent conversion of his interest in the stock,
and in the last five counts that the defendants had induced
him to make further payments on such stock in the way of

declines to prosecute after notice; (3) founded upon a claim for taxable

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

The question whether the claim thus set forth is barred by
the discharge depends upon the proper construction of section 17, which declares that the discharge in bankruptcy relieves the bankrupt from all of his "provable debts" except
such as

".

.

.

(2) are judgments in actions for frauds,

or obtaining property by false pretences, or false representations, or for wilful and malicious injuries to the property or
person of another

.

.

.

or (4) were created by his fraud,

embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting
as an officer, or in any fiduciary capacity."
Do these words apply to all debts created by the fraud,
embezzlement, misappropriation of the bankrupt, or only to
such as were created while he was acting as an officer or in
some fiduciary capacity? The fact that the second subdivision of section 17 excepted from the discharge "all judgments
in actions for frauds, or of obtaining property by false pretences, or false representations," indicates quite clearly that
as to frauds in general it was the intention of Congress only
to except from the discharge such as had been reduced to
judgment, unless they fall within the fourth subdivision, of
those created by the fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation,
or defalcation of the bankrupt while acting as an officer or in
a fiduciary capacity. Unless these words relate back to all
the preceding words of the subdivision, namely, the frauds
and embezzlements, as well as misappropriations or defalcations, it results that the exception in subdivision 2 of all
judgments for fraud is meaningless, . since such judgments
would be based upon a fraud excepted from discharge by
subdivision 4, whether judgment had been obtained or not.
This conclusion is fortified by reference to corresponding
sections of the former bankrupt acts. Thus, by the first section of the act or 1841, 5 Stat. 440, the benefits of that act were
extended to all persons owing debts "which shall not have
been created in consequence of a defalcation as a public officer;
or as executor, administrator, guardian or trustee, or while
acting in any other fiduciary capacity." It is entirely clear

CRAWFORD v. BURKE.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

that under this section a discharge was not denied to the
bankrupt by reason of debts fraudulently contracted, but only
to such as were created by his defalcation as an officer, or
while acting in a fiduciary capacity.
We may remark here in passing that ever since the case of
Chapman v. Forsyth, 2 How. 202, this court has held that a
commission merchant and factor who sells for others is not
indebted in a fiduciary capacity within the bankruptcy acts
by withholding the money received for property sold by him.
This rule was made under the bankruptcy act of 1841, and
has since been repeated many times under subsequent acts.
Neal v. Clark, 95 U. S. 704, 708; Hennequin v. Clews, 111 U. S.
676, 679; Noble v. Hammond, 129 U. S. 65, 68; Upshur v. Briscoe, 138 U. S. 365, 375, as well as in cases in the state courts
too numerous for citation.
Under the bankruptcy act of 1867 the list of debts excluded
from the operation of the discharge was considerably larger.
In section 33, Revised Statutes, 5117, it was declared that :
"No debt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt, or by his defalcation as a public officer, or while acting
in any fiduciary character, shall be discharged by proceedings
in bankruptcy; but the debt may be proved, and the dividend
thereon shall be a payment on account of such debt."
The language of this seotion is so clear as to require no
construction. It is plain and explicit to the effect that the
fraud and embezzlement of the bankrupt need not have been
committed by him while acting as an officer or-in a fiduciary
character, and that this character relates only to his defalcation. But under the act of 1898 there is no such severance,
in the fourth paragraph as would authorize us to say that the
term "fiduciary capacity" did not extend back to the words
"fraud, embezzlement and misappropriation."' It was the
opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois that "a mere'change
in phraseology, apparently for the sake of brevity, rendering
the meaning somewhat obscure, cannot be regarded as showing
a legislative intent to depart so radically from precedents es-

tablished by previous bankruptcy legislation and judicial decisions, as to provide that debts created by fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt should be released by his discharge in
bankruptcy, unless such fraud or .mbezzlement should be
committed while the bankrupt was acting as a public officer,
or in a fiduciary capacity."
Our own view, however, is that a change in phraseology
creates a presumption of a change in intent, and that Congress
would not have used such different language in section 17 from
that used in section 33 of the act of 1867, without thereby
intending a change of meaning. The view generally taken by
the bankruptcy courts has been that the terms "officer" and
"fiduciary capacity" extend to all the claims mentioned in
paragraph 4, and are not confined to cases of defalcation. In re
Rhutassel, 96 Fed. Rep. 597; In re Lewensohn, 99 Fed. Rep.
73; In re.Hirschman, 104 Fed. Rep. 69; In re Cole, 106 Fed.
Rep. 837; In re Freche, 109 Fed. Rep. 620; Hargadine-McKittrick Dry Goods Co. v. Hudson, 111 Fed. Rep. 361. This
is the natural and grammatical reading of the clause.
The cases in the state courts are almost uniformly to the
same effect. Thus in Smith & Wallace Co. v. Lambert, 69
N. J. Law, 487, the defendant pleaded to an action on a book
account his discharge in bankruptcy, to which the plaintiff
replied that the cause of action was created by the fraud of
the defendant. The Supreme Court of New Jersey held the
replication to be insufficient. "We think," said the court,
"that under section 17 of the bankrupt law, to which reference
has been made, there is no provision that would except from
the discharge the debt upon which the present suit is brought."
In Morse v. Kauffman, 100 Virginia, 218, it was pleaded
against the discharge that the goods were procured by false
pretenses. After holding that the case had not fallen within
subdivision 2 of section 17, as there was no judgment for fraud,
the Supreme Court of Virginia observed:
"It would seem to be equally clear that the demand of
plaintiffs in error is not within the exception of subdivision 4

CRAWFORD v. BURKE.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of section 17. It is not pretended that the claim was created
by the bankrupt's fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or
defalcation while acting as an officer, or in any fiduciary
capacity."
"The contention that 'fraud' should be segregated from
the qualifying language 'while acting as an officer or in any
fiduciary capacity' is without merit. Such interpretation
would not only destroy the grammatical construction of the
sentences and contravene its plain meaning, but it would
likewise be inconsistent with paragraph-2 of "the same sectionthat a creditor should have obtained judgment in an action
for fraud in order to override a discharge in, bankruptcy."
A like construction was given to subdivision 4 by the Supreme Court of Missouri in Goodman v. Herman, 172 Missouri,
344, by the Supreme Court of Minnesota in Gee v. Gee, 84
Minnesota 384, by that of Rhode Island in Crosby v. Miller,
25 R. I. 172, and by the Supreme Court of New York,. fourth
department, in In re Bullis, 73 N. Y. Supp. 1047. In this case
the question was discussed at considerable length, the court
saying:
"If any debt created by fraud, embezzlement or misappropriation is to be 6xcepted from the application of the statute,
then there is no necessity for subdivision 2, making a judgment essential to prevent the granting of the discharge under
the'statute."
We have not overlooked the fact that the New York Supreme Court of the first department reached a different conclusion in Frey v. Torrey, 70 App. Div. 166, affirmed by the
Court of Appeals in aper curiam opinion, 175 N. Y. 501, but
so far as we know this is the only case that supports the construction given to section 17 by the Supreme Court of Illinois.
Why an ordinary claim for fraud should be released by the
discharge, while a judgment for fraud is not released, is not
altogether clear, although 'this distinction may have been
created to avoid the necessity of going into conflicting evidence
upon the subject of fraud; while in cases of judgments for

frauds the judgment itself would be evidence of the fraudulent
character of the claim. If a creditor has a claim against a
debtor for goods sold which would ordinarily be covered by a
discharge in bankruptcy, he is strongly tempted to allege, and
if possible to prove, that the goods were purchased under a
misrepresentation of the assets of the buyer, and thus to make
out a claim for fraud which would not be discharged in bankruptcy. It was probably this contingency which induced
Congress to enact that an alleged fraud of this kind should be
reduced to judgment before it could be set up in bar of a
discharge.
The intent of Congress in changing the language of the act
of 1867 seems to have been to restore the act of 1841, which,
as already observed, extended the benefits of the law to every
debtor who had not been guilty of defalcation as a public
officer or in a fiduciary capacity, the act of 1898 adding, however, to the excepted class those against whom a judgment
for fraud had been obtained.
Some stress is laid by the Supreme Court of Illinois upon
the punctuation of subdivision 4, section 17, presumably upon
the insertion of a comma after the word "misappropriation,"
thereby indicating a severance of that which precedes from
that which follows. While we do not deny that punctuation
may shed some light upon the construction of a statute, Joy v.
St. Louis, 138 U. S. 1, 32, we do not think it is entitled to
weight in this case. In the enumeration of persons or things
in acts of Congress it has been the custom for many years to
insert a comma before the final "and" or "or" which precedes
the last thing enumerated, apparently for greater precision,
but without special significance. So little is punctuation a
part of statutes that courts will read them with such stops
as will give effect to the whole. Doe v. Martin, 4 J. R. 65;
Hammock v. Loan & Trust Co., 105 U. S. 77, 84; United States
v. Lacher, 134 U. S. 624, 628; United States v. Isham, 17 Wall.

2. But it is strenuously insisted by the plaintiff that a claim

Opinion of the Court.

for the conversion of personal property is not within the scope
of section 17; because it is not a "provable debt" within the
definition of section 63a. Did the latter section stand alone,
there would be some ground for saying that, a claim, though
"founded upon an open account, or upon a contract, express
or implied," would not be a provable debt, if plaintiff elected
to treat the conversion as fraudulent and sue in trover, though
he might have chosen to waive the tort and bring an action
for a balance due on account. An early English case, Parker v.
Crole, 5 Bingham, 63, is cited to the effect that the operation
of the discharge is determined by the election of the creditor
to sue in assumpsit or case. A like ruling was made in certain
cases under the bankruptcy acts of 1841 and 1867. Williamson
v. Dickens, 27 N. Car. 259; Oliver v. Hughes, 8 Pa. St. 426;
Bradner v. Strang, 89 N. Y. 299, 307.
But we think that section 63a, defining provable debts, must
be read in connection with section, 17, limiting the operation
of discharges, in which the provable character of claims for
fraud in general is recognized, by excepting from a discharge
claims for frauds which have been reduced to judgment, or
which were committed by the bankrupt while acting as an
officer, or in a fiduciary capacity. If no fraud could be made
the basis of a provable debt, why were certain frauds excepted
from the operation of a discharge? We are, therefore, of opinion that if a debt originates or is "founded upon an open account or upon a contract, express or implied," it is provable
against the bankrupt's estate, though the creditor may elect
to bring his action in trover as for a fraudulent conversion,
instead of in assumpsit for a balance due upon an open account. It certainly could not have been the intention of
Congress to extend the operation of the discharge under section 17 to debts that were not provable under section 63a.
It results from the construction we have given the latter section .that all debts originating upon an open account or upon
a contract, express or implied, are provable, though plaintiff
elect to bring his action for fraud.

In the case under consideration defendants purchased, under
the instructions of the plaintiff, certain stocks and opened an
account with him, charging him with commission and interest,
and crediting him with amounts received as margins. Subsequently, and without the knowledge of the plaintiff, they
sold these stocks, and thereby converted them to their own
use. Without going into the details of the facts, it is evident
that the plaintiff might have sued them in an action on contract, charging them with the money advanced and with the
value of the stock; or in an action of trover based upon their
conversion. For reasons above given, we do not think that
his election to sue in tort deprived his debt of its provable
character, and that as there is no evidence that the frauds
perpetrated by the defendants were committed by them in an
official or fiduciary capacity, plaintiff's claim against them was
discharged by the proceedings in bankruptcy.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is therefore
reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
