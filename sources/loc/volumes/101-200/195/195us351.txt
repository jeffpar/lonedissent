Judgment affirmed.

THE CITY OF SEATTLE v. KELLEHER.
APPEAL FROM THE PIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.
No. 29. Argued October 28, 1904.-Decided November 28,1904.
An assessment on lands for the entire expense of opening a street levied
under a front foot assessment authorized by statute is not necessarily
void under the Fourteenth Amendment because levied after the work
was completed, or because at the time the work was ordered the municipality had power, under statutes repealed after the completion of the
work and before the assessment was made, to include a portion of the
expense in the general taxes and to levy the assessment on a valuation
basis under which a smaller amount would have been assessed against
these lands.
Taxation, whether general or special, is not subject to the rules applicable
to a vendor's lien and its enforcement against a bona fide purchaser for
value, and it is for one purchasing lands after a public improvement has
been completed to inquire whether it has been paid for, and the same
rules as to the enforcement of the assessment applicable to the former
owners are applicable to him.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Leaving out the violation of plain statutes involved here,
there is such inequality as amounts to confiscation. It was
grossly unnecessary and unjust to include this vacant, unoccupied tract in a district which was to bear the expense of
planking when that planking was extended only along the
settled portion of the street, and was to stop a thousand feet
from our own tract, vacant and wild. Norwood v. Baker, 172

Even if the original owner could not avoid the reassessment
his grantee could. The reassessment was by a subsequent
law against an innocent purchaser. Richards v. Shingle Co.,

The lien resisted was a secret one. This seems to us not
true of liens reassessed under laws existing before the new
purchaser comes in. There he buys with the knowledge that
the State has already asserted the right, though it has not yet
exercised the intention. As against subsequent laws, the purchaser may well protest that at the time he bought, the State
had not even asserted a right. The State should be estopped.

MR. JusTicE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court declaring an assessment upon the plaintiff's land void under the
Fourteenth Armendment, and enjoining the city against enforcing the same. The facts are these: Weller Street, in
Seattle, runs east from Elliott Bay, and formerly stopped
at the east line of Maynard's Donation Claim. The land now
belonging to the appellee, the plaintiff below, is a hundred
acres lying on the east of that line, extending to the line of the
Jackson Street Addition. Weller Street, if extended eastward,
would run through the middle of this land for twenty-five
hundred feet. While this land belonged to one Hill, in 1889,
he petitioned that Weller Street be extended and graded to
the Jackson Street Addition line, and he submitted to the
City Council and circulated, although he did not record, plans

Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

showing the extension, with his land on the two sides of it
divided into lots and blocks. The plan was approved, and
in 1890 the city passed an ordinance that Weller Street be
graded from the beginning to Jackson Street Addition, and
that sidewalks be constructed on both sides of it coextensive
with the grade. Ordinance No. 1285. The street was graded,
and, according to the testimony, had to be cut and filled
almost continuously. It also was planked for some distance,
but the planking stopped about a thousand feet before reaching Hill's tract. Then an assessment was levied, but this was
held void. The next things that happened were a sale of Hill's
land and a mortgage of it in January, 1892, .to the appellee,
which later was foreclosed. The appellee, who lived out of
the State, alleges that he was ignorant of the submission of
the plan by Hill.
On March 9, 1893, an act was approved authorizing a new
assessment, when the old one had been declared void, upon
the lands benefited, to the extent of their proportionate part
of the expense of the improvement, based upon its actual value
at the time of its completion, and having reference to the
benefits received. Notice by publication of a time for hearing
objections was provided for, with an appeal to the courts.
Laws of 1893, c. 95. When the improvement in question was
ordered, by the charter of Seattle the planking was to be paid
for out of the general taxes. Laws of 1885, 1886, pp. 238, 241,
ยง 7. The special assessment for the other elements, according to the assessed value of the land, could be imposed upon
the abutting property to one hundred and twenty-eight feet
back from the street. This was modified by a new charter
adopted later in 1890, and still in force. Under the latter the
assessment was to be by the front foot, with different percentages for four parallel subdivisions at successive distances
from the street up to one hundred and twenty feet. It was
to be for the cost of the improvement. To carry out the plan,
local improvement districts were to be established, including
all the property within the termini of the improvement, and

not more than one hundred and twenty feet on each side of
the margin. Reassessments were authorized. In pursuance
of the charter an ordinance was adopted by the city providing
the manner in which the local assessments should be made.
Ordinance No. 2085.
In this state of the ordinances and laws a reassessment of
the whole cost of the improvement was ordered in January,
1894, in conformity with the act of 1893, the new charter and
the Ordinance No. 2085. Ordinance No. 3199. The proper
steps were taken and the assessment was confirmed on March 5,
1894. Ordinance No. 3267. By this assessment the whole
cost of the improvement, $35,620.60, was levied on the abutting land, and $14,262.68 was fixed as the plaintiff's share.
It is alleged that he thus is charged forty-four per cent under
the present plan, whereas under the one in force when the
improvement was made he would have been charged only
thirty-two per cent. It also is alleged that, being absent from
the State, he did not know of the reassessment proceedings
until they were concluded.
The bill disputed, among other things, that the prolongation of Weller Street through the plaintiff's land, ever had been
dedicated as a street. But in view of the assumption by the
Circuit Court that the dedication was made out and the statement by it that the point had been decided by the Supreme
Court of the State, this objection, if open, very properly was
not pressed before us. See Seattle v. Hill, 23 Washington, 92.
Therefore we have not gone into details upon that part of the
case. We see no cause to doubt that the Circuit Court was
right. The main ground of argument is that the planking
could not be included in the assessment. The reasons, as
summed up by the Circuit Court, are that the law in force
at the time of doing the work did not authorize a charge for
planking upon the abutting property, that the Ordinance
No. 1285 ordering the improvement did not authorize any
planking, that the city could assess only the land abutting on
the improvement and the plaintiff's land was far away from

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

the planking, and that such an assessment of the whole cost,
including the planking, on the property on Weller Street, is
absolutely unfair as to the plaintiff's land.
A general attack upon the statute of 1893 is not attempted.
It was within the power of the legislature to create, or to
authorize the creation, of special taxing districts, and to charge
the cost of a local improvement upon the property in such a
district by frontage. Webster v. Fargo, 181 U. S. 394; French
v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., 181 U. S. 324; M11cNamee v.
Tacoma, 24 Washington, 591, 595; Cooley, Const. Lim., 7th ed.,
729. The only question of principle, therefore, raised by the
inclusion of the planking in the sum of which the plaintiff was
to pay his share is whether it was manifestly unfair in this
particular case. Taken by itself it looks like an unwarrantable
attempt to make one man pay for another man's convenience.
On the other hand, so far as the work was similar in character, throughout the street, we are of opinion that the improvement might be regarded as one. Webster v. Fargo, 181
U. S. 394. See Lincoln v. Street Commissioners, 176 Massachusetts, 210, 212.

And if this be admitted we cannot say

that the assessing board might not have been warranted in
thinking that substantial justice was done. There were many
cuts and fills made in grading the road. So far as appears, the
heaviest work may have been done on the plaintiff's land,
which seems to have been the summit of an ascent. Improvement of one sort may have been the greatest there, while
that of a different kind, needed where the travel was, was at
the other end of the street. It is true that the Circuit Judge
considered that there was manifest injustice in assessing the
plaintiff's land, which was empty and unimproved, by the
front foot at the same rate as the improved land lower down
and nearer to the bay, and that his opinion naturally carries
weight, from his probable acquaintance with the condition of
the place. But we do not find a sufficient warrant for it on
the record. We must consider how things looked at the time.
The owner of the land desired the improvements, if carried out

SEATTLE v. KELLEHER.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

as he wished. The extension of the street helped to bring his
land into the market. It was more likely to benefit him than
those who were lower down. We cannot invalidate the assessment because the speculation has failed. Assuming, without
deciding, that the question is open to the plaintiff in this proceeding, we are of opinion that the record does not justify
interference by injunction on the ground that the assessment
was manifestly unfair.
The answer to the other objections may be made in few
words. If, as is said, planking was not authorized under the
word "sidewalks" in Ordinance No. 1285, the city has done
or adopted the work and presumably has paid for it. At the
end the benefit was there, on the ground, at the city's expense.
The principles of taxation are not those of contract. A special
assessment may be levied upon an executed consideration,
that is to say, for a public work already done. Bellows v.
Weeks, 41 Vermont, 590, 599, 600; Mills v. Charleton, 29 Wisconsin, 400, 413; Hall v. Street Commissioners, 177 Massachusetts, 434, 439. If this were not so it might be hard to justify
reassessments. See Norwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269, 293;
Williams v. Supervisors of Albany, 122 U. S. 154; Frederick
v. Seattle, 13 Washington, 428; Cline v. Seattle,'13 Washington,
444; Bacon v. Seattle, 15 Washington, 701; Cooley, Taxation,
3d ed., 1280. The same answer is sufficient if it be true that
when the work was done the cost of planking could not be included in the special assessment, which again depends on the
meaning of the.words "sidewalk" and "pave" in the old
Charter, ยง 8, taken with the special provision for planking in
ยง 7. Laws of 1885- 1886, pp. 238, 241. The charge of planking on the general taxes was not a contract with the landowners, and no more prevented a special assessment being
authorized for it later than silence of the laws at the same
time as to how it should be paid for would have. In either
case the legislature could do as it thought best. Of course, it
does not matter that this is called a reassessment. A reassessment may be a new assessment. Whatever the legislature

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

could authorize if it were ordering an assessment for the first
time it equally could authorize, notwithstanding a previous
invalid attempt to assess. The previous attempt left the city
free "to take such steps as were within its power to take,
either under existing statutes, or under any authority that
might thereafter be conferred upon it, to make a new assessment upon the plaintiff's abutting property" in any constitutional way. Norwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269, 293; McNamee v. Tacoma, 24 Washington, 591; Annie Wright Seminary
v. Tacoma, 23 Washington, 109.
We think it unnecessary to consider other questions on the
part of the case that we have dealt with. We have said enough
in our opinion to show that the enforcement of the assessment
lien could not be prevented by the original owner. It is urged,
however, that a different rule could be applied in favor of one
who purchased the land under the circumstances stated above.
But the attempt to liken taxation, whether general or special,
to the enforcement of a vendor's lien, and thus to introduce
the doctrine concerning bona fide purchasers for value, rests
on a fallacy similar to that which we have mentioned above,
which would deny the right to tax upon an executed consideration. A man cannot get rid of his liability to a tax by
buying without notice. See Tallman v. Janesville, 17 Wisconsin, 71, 76; Cooley, Taxation, 3d ed., 527, 528. Indeed he
cannot buy without notice, since the liability is one of the
notorious incidents of social life. In this case the road was
cut through the plaintiff's land, and, if he had looked, was visible upon the ground. Whether it had been paid for was
for him to inquire. The history of what had happened would
have suggested that it was not improbable that sooner or later
a payment must be made.
