THE BLACKHEATH.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA.
No. 35. Argued October 31, 1904.-Decided November 28, 1904.

Admiralty has jurisdiction of a libel in rem against a vessel for the damages caused by its negligently running into a beacon in a channel,
although the beacon is attached to the bottom.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General McReynolds for the United
States, appellant.
Jurisdiction of torts in admiralty depends upon localitywhere the cause of action is completed on navigable waters
admiralty has jurisdiction, but where it is completed on land
the remedy belongs to the courts of common law. The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20, cited and approved in Ex parte Phenix
Insurance Company, 118 U. S. 618; Johnson v. Chicago &
Pacific Elevator Co., 119 U. S. 388; Homer Ramsdell Transportation Co. v. La Compagnie, G~n~rale Transatlantique, 182
U. S. 406, 411. See The Rock Island Bridge, 6 Wall. 213, 215a proceeding in rem against a bridge for damage to a ship
where jurisdiction was denied.
This court has not attempted to give a general definition
of what is land and what is water within the meaning of the
admiralty law and the rule adopted in The Plymouth. In The
Robert W. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17, 33, it was held that repairs
to a ship in a dry dock were not made on land.
There are no adjudicated cases involving injury by a ship
to a beacon set up in navigable waters. Bridges, piers and
wharves which pertain to the land are, in fact, mere extensions of the shore, and therefore torts to them are distinctly
different from torts to structures lawfully within navigable

The opinions of this court discussing the origin, nature and
jurisdiction of admiralty courts demonstrate a well defined
purpose to construe liberally the terms "all cases of admiralty
and maritime jurisdiction" and to ascertain its boundary "by
a reasonable and just construction of the words used in the
Constitution, taken in connection with the whole instrument
and the purposes for which admiralty and maritime jurisdiction were granted to the Federal government." The Steamer

thereof. It was not connected with the shore, and was not
erected for any purpose pertaining to the land. Lights are
highly important adjuncts to navigation, and their safety will
be better secured by the speedy processes of admiralty courts
than by the actions in personam in a court of law. The Gas
Float Whitton, 2 L. R. App. Cas. 337, 349.
If in admiralty there is no adequate remedy for injuries to
harbor and channel lights by foreign ships, the Government
is without power to properly protect and preserve these highly
important adjuncts to commerce and navigation.
Mr. Benjamin Carter, with whom Mr. R. H. Clarke was on
the brief, for appellee:
A tort, to be a subject of admiralty jurisdiction, must have
been consummated, in some navigable area, (1) merely on or
in or (2) through action of the water. This proposition is in
harmony with the text of all the decisions for the United States
Attorney General cited on the Government's brief which cannot be said to impeach it.
Where the wrongful act and its injurious consequences were
indistinguishable, with respect to time and place, the inquiry
has turned on the mere locality of the act itself. Under this
head many of the cases cited fall.
In other cases discussed or cited in the Government's argument the inquiry was whether the. injury following on the
tortious act was accomplished by supervening action of the
water, mechanical or chemical. But see Cope v. Vallette Dry
Dock Co., 119 U. S. 625, in which this court held that injury
to a dry dock was not cognizable in admiralty.
In the United States admiralty jurisdiction is not derived
from any considerations of international or even maritime
convenience. It is purely the creature of our Constitution,
and so shut off from those accretions which, in view of the
policy and institutions of other Christian nations, might be
commended. With reference to England, especially, it is clear
that, if our admiralty courts have the ancient admiralty juris-

diction, they have not that which exists in England today.
The Maud Webster, 8 Ben. 552.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from the District Court on the question
of jurisdiction, which is certified. The case is a libel in rem
against a British vessel for the destruction of a beacon, Number 7, Mobile ship-channel lights, caused by the alleged negligent running into the beacon by the vessel. The beacon stood
fifteen or twenty feet from the channel of Mobile river, or bay,
in water twelve or fifteen feet deep, and was built on piles
driven firmly into the bottom. There is no question that it
was attached to the realty and that it was a part of it by the
ordinary criteria of the common law. On this ground the
District Court declined jurisdiction and dismissed the libel.
The Blackheath, 122 Fed. Rep. 112.
in The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20, where a libel was brought by
the owners of a wharf burned by a fire negligently started on
a vessel, the jurisdiction was denied by this court. See also
Ex parte Phcenix Ins. Co., 118 U. S. 610. In two later cases
there are dicta denying the jurisdiction equally when a building on shore is damaged by a vessel running into it. Johnson
v. Chicago and Pacific Elevator Co., 119 U. S. 388; Homer
Ramsdell TransportationCo. v. La Compagnie G~n6rale Transatlantique, 182 U. S. 406, 411. And there are a number of
decisions of District and other courts since The Plymouth,
which more or less accord with the conclusion of the court
below. 62 C. C. A. 287, 290. It would be simple, if simplicity were the only thing to be considered, to confine the
admiralty jurisdiction, in respect of damage to property, to
damage done to property afloat. That distinction sounds like
a logical consequence of the rule determining the admiralty
cognizance of torts by place.
On the other hand, it would be a strong thing to say that
Congress has no constitutional power to give the admiralty

THE BLACKHEATH.

Opinion of the Court.

here as broad a jurisdiction as it has in England or France.
Or, if that is in some degree precluded, it ought at least to be
possible for Congress to authorize the admiralty to give redress
for damage by a ship; in a case like this, to instruments and
aids of navigation prepared and owned by the Government.
But Congress cannot enlarge the constitutional grant of power,
and therefore if it could permit a libel to be maintained, one
can be maintained now. We are called on by the appellees
to say that the remedy for any case of damage to a fixture is
outside the constitutional grant.
The precise scope of admiralty jurisdiction is not a matter.
of obvious principle or of very accurate history. As to principle, it is clear that if the beacon had been in fault and had
hurt the ship a libel could have been maintained against a
private owner, although not in rem. Philadelphia,Wilmington
& Baltimore R. R. v. Philadelphia & Havre de Grace Steam
Towboat Co., 23 How. 209; Atlee v. Packet Co., 21 Wall. 389;
Panama Railroad v. Napier Shipping Co., 166 U. S. -280.
Compare The Rock Island Bridge, 6 Wall. 213. But, as has
been suggested, there seems to be no reason why the fact that
the injured property was afloat should have more weight in
determining the jurisdiction than the fact that the cause of
the injury was. The Arkansas, 17 Fed. Rep. 383, 387; The
F. & P. M. No. 2, 33 Fed. Rep. 511, 515; Hughes, Adm. 183.
And again it seems more arbitrary than rational to treat
attachment to the soil as a peremptory bar outweighingthe
considerations that the injured thing was an instrument of
navigation and no part of the shore, but surrounded on every
side by water, a mere point projecting from the sea.
As to history, while as is well known the admiralty jurisdiction of this country has not been limited by the local
traditions of England, The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 574,
et seq., the traditions of England favor it in a case like this.
The admiral's authority was not excluded by attachment even
to the main shore. From before the time of Rowghton's
Articles he could hold inquest over nuisances there to naviga-

Black Book, 445, 446. See Crosse v. Diggs, 1 Sid. 158. Spelman says: "The place absolutely subject to the jurisdiction
of the admiraltie, is the sea, which seemeth to comprehencr
publick rivers, fresh waters, creekes, and surrounded places
whatsoever within the ebbing and flowing of the sea at the
highest water." Eng. Works, 2d ed. 226. Finally, by the
articles of February 18, 1633, all the judges of England agreed
that the admiralty jurisdiction extended to "injuries there
which concern navigation upon the sea." Exton, Maritime
Dica-ology, ad fin., pp. 262, 263. And "if the libel be founded
upon one single continued act, which was principally upon the
sea, though part was upon land, a prohibition will not go."
Com. Dig. Admiralty, F. 5; 1 Roll. Abr. 533, pl. 18.
What the early law seems most to have looked to as fixing
the liability of the ship was the motion of the vessel, which
was treated as giving it the character of a responsible cause.
Bracton recognizes this as an extravagance, but admits the
fact, for the common law. 122a, 136b. 1 Select Pleas of the
Crown, 1 Seld. Soc. Pub. 84. The same was true in the admiralty. Rowghton, ubi sup. art. 50; 2 Rot. Parl. 345, 346,

493. The responsibility of the moving cause took the form
of deodand when it occasioned death, like the steam engine
in Regina v. Eastern Counties Ry., 10 M. & W. 58, and innum-

erable early instances, but it was not confined to such cases,

Adm., 6 Seld. Soc. Publ. lxxi, lxxii. The principle has remained until the present day. The Malek Adhel, 2 How. 210,
234; The China, 7 Wall. 53.
The foregoing references seem to us enough to show that to
maintain jurisdiction in this case is no innovation even upon
the old English law. But a very little history is sufficient to
justify the conclusion that the Constitution does not prohibit
what convenience and reason demand.
In the case of The Plymouth there.was nothing maritime in
the nature of the tort for which the vessel was attached. The
fact that the fire originated on a vessel gave no character to
the result, and that circumstance is mentioned in the judgment of the court, and is contrasted with collision, although
the consideration is not adhered to as the sole ground for the
decree. It has been given weight in other cases. Campbell
v. H. Hackleld & Co., 62 C. C. A. 274; The Queen v. Judge of
City of London Court, [1892] 1 Q. B. 273, 294; Benedict, Admiralty, 3d ed. § 308. Moreover, the damage was done wholly
upon the mainland. It never has been decided that every
fixture in the midst of the sea was governed by the same rule.
The contrary has been supposed in some American cases, The
Arkansas, 17 Fed. Rep. 383, 387; The F. & P. M. No. 2, 33
Fed. Rep. 511, 515, and is indicated by the English books
cited above. It is unnecessary to determine the relative
weight of the different elements of distinction between The
Plymouth and the case at bar. It is enough to say that we
now are dealing with an injury to a government aid to navigation from ancient times subject to the admiralty, a beacon
emerging from the water, injured by the motion of the vessel,
by a continuous act beginning and consummated upon navigable water, and giving character to the effects upon a point
which is only technically land, through a connection at the
bottom of the sea. In such a case jurisdiction may be taken
without transcending the limits of the Constitution or en-

Decree reversed.
MR. JusTIcE BROWN, concurring.
I do not dissent from the conclusion of the court, although
for forty years the broad language of Mr. Justice Nelson in
the case of The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20, has been accepted by the
profession and the admiralty courts as establishing the principle that the jurisdiction of the admiralty does not extend to
injuries received by any structure affixed to the land, though
such injuries were caused by a ship or other floating body.
It received the approval of this court in the case of the Phcenix
Insurance Company, 118 U. S. 610, and in that of the Chicago
& Pacific Elevator Company, 119 U. S. 388, and has been
followed by the courts of at least a dozen different districts,
and applied to bridges, piers, derricks and every other class
of structure permanently affixed to the soil.
I do not think this case can be distinguished from the prior
ones, as, in my opinion, it makes no difference in principle
whether a beacon be affixed to piles driven into the bottom of
the river or to a stone projecting from the bottom, or whether
it be surrounded by twelve feet or one foot of water, or whether
the injury be done to a wharf projecting into a navigable
water, or to a beacon standing there, or whether the damage
be caused by a negligent fire or by bad steering.
I accept this case as practically overruling the former ones,
and as recognizing the principle adopted by the English Admiralty Court Jurisdiction Act of 1861 (sec. 7), extending the
jurisdiction of the admiralty court to "any claim for damages
by any ship." This has been held in many cases to include
damage done to a structure affixed to the land. The distinction between damage done to fixed and to floating structures is a somewhat artificial one, and, in my view, founded

upon no sound principle; and the fact that Congress, under
the Constitution, cannot extend our admiralty jurisdiction,
affords an argument for a broad interpretation commensurate
with the needs of modern commerce. To attempt to draw
the line of jurisdiction between different kinds of fixed structures, as, for instance, between beacons and wharves, would
lead to great confusion and much further litigation.

CITIZENS' NATIONAL BANK OF KANSAS CITY v.
DONNELL.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 36. Argued November 1, 1904.-Decided November 28, 1904.

Under §§ 5197, 5198, U. S. Rev. Stat., a national bank which compounds
interest in a manner prohibited by the State forfeits all interest even
though the total interest amounts to less than the maximum rate permitted by the State.
A national bank, met in an action by the plea of usury, may not avoid the
forfeiture of all interest by then declaring an election to remit the excessive interest.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Oliver H. Dean, with whom Mr. William D. McLeod
and Mr. Hale Holden were on the brief, for plaintif in error:
The national banking act authorizes the taking of the
highest rate allowed by the State. The State allowed eight
per cent and the bank never took over seven and a half per
cent. The interest on the overdraft at twelve per cent only
amounted to $14.51 and the principle of de minimis applies.
The question of what is compound interest is one for the 6ourt.
The method of business to be pursued by a national bank
cannot be prescribed by a state statute; it rests upon higher
authority. Tyler on Usury, 244.
