PATTERSON v. HEWITT.
APPAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF

NEW MEXICO.
No. 23. Argued October 25, 26,190-Decided November 28, 1904.

The owners of a mining claim in New Mexico transferred their interests to
one of their number as trustee, who was to retransfer to each one contributing his share of development expenses for a year, a'one-eighth interest. Plaintiff, one of the parties, contributed his share and demanded
a deed which th6 trustee refused to give. Plaintiff made no further demand and did not contribute any more to the expenses, but the trustee
and some of the other owners continued to develop the claim, and finally
succeeded in finding a valuable body of ore. Eight years after the former
demand plaintiff commenced an action in equity to enforce the original
trust. There is a statute in New Mexico to the effect that no action for
the recovery of lands shall be commenced after a lapse of ten years, etc.
Held:
That persons having claims to mining property in the course of development are bound to the utmost diligence in enforcing them, and in such
cases the doctrine of laches is relentlessly enforced.
That while in actions at law, courts are bound by the literalism of statutes,
in equity the question of unreasonable delay within the statutory limitation is still open, and that even where a statute of limitations exists and
has been made applicable in general terms to suits in equity, defendant
may avail of the laches of complainant, notwithstanding the time fixed
by the statute has not expired.
Tl.at the refusal by a trustee of a demand to execute a deed in alleged pursuance of a trust agreement is a repudiation of the trust and opens the
door to the defense of laches.
That a delay of eight years during which large sums of money have been
spent in developing a mining property is inexcusable laches.

APPELLANTS C. Ewing Patterson, a resident of New Jersey,
and Henry J. Patterson, a resident of New Mexico, on April 29,

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.
Statement of the Case.

195 U. S.

1903, filed their bill of complaint in the District Court for
Lincoln County, Territory of New Mexico, against John Y.
Hewitt, William Watson, Mathew Hoyle, and Harvey B. Fergusson, residents of New Mexico, and the Old Abe Company,
a corporation of the same Territory, to enforce a trust which
is alleged to have existed between the appellants and the defendant Hewitt, and by virtue of which they sought to recover a one-fourth interest in two mining locations made in

the name of John Y. Hewitt on the second day of May, 1884.
The bill prayed for an accounting of proceeds of ores taken
from the mines, and a lien on the property, for an injunction
and the appointment of a receiver.
The facts in the case as found by the District Court and
adopted by the Supreme Court are substantially as follows:
In 1881 the property in controversy was claimed by the
appellants and by Watson, one of the defendants, under locations previously made by them. Between 1881 and 1883,
appellants, in conjunction with the defendant Watson, did a
large amount of work upon the claims, and were asserting their
rights under the mining laws of the United States. During
this time the same ground was also claimed by other parties,
among whom was the defendant Hewitt. In August, 1883, a
dispute arose in regard to this property between appellants
and the defendant Watson on one side, and the other parties
upon the other side.
The parties interested held a meeting in August or September, 1883, for the purpose of adjusting the differences then
existing between them, and to endeavor, if possible, to arrive
at an agreement whereby the interests of all would be protected. The two appellants, the defendant Watson and the
defendant Hewitt, with several others who were interested,
attended this meeting. The result was an agreement between
them that all the old locations then existing, whether made by
the appellants or any of the defendants, or conflicting claimants, should be from that date abandoned, surrendered and
given up by all of the parties, and that the ground should be-

Statement of the Case.

put in possession of Hewitt as trustee, to hold in his own name
for the benefit of all the parties then interested. It was also
agreed that Hewitt, as such trustee, should make a deed to
such of the said parties holding interests therein as should
contribute their part to the work, labor and expenses necessary
to obtain a patent to the land; but there was no agreement as
to what should become of the interests of any one who failed
to contribute his share of the expenses. It was also agreed
that each of the appellants contributing his share of the expenses should receive a one-eighth interest in the location, and
that the said Watson and Hewitt should each receive a oneeighth interest, part on account of their services and part on
account of their interests in the ground, and that the remaining shares should go to other parties who were interested
therein.
In pursuance of this agreement Hewitt took charge of
the property, and together with the defendant Watson, and
one of the appellants, Patterson, superintended and directed
the work upon said mine during the year 1883 and part of the
year 1884. In order to raise money for the working of the
mine it was agreed that a one-sixth interest should be sold
to H. B. Fergusson for five hundred dollars.
During 1884 and 1885 a sufficient amount of work was done
upon the property to obtain a patent, and to discover mineral
thereon. The appellants contributed their share of the work,
which enabled the trustee to obtain a patent, and so far carried
out their part of the agreement as to entitle them to a deed
from the trustee for their one-eighth interest each, according
to said agreement.
In April, 1885, the appellant Henry J. Patterson, in person
and by his agent, demanded a deed from Hewitt, trustee, of
the one-eighth interest to which he claimed to be entitled; but
the defendant Hewitt at that time refused to make the said
deed, and has ever since refused to execute the same, and has
disputed his right thereto.
No demand for a deed appears to have been made by C.

Ewing Patterson until just before the commencement of this
suit, when it was also refused.
In 1883, the complainant C. Ewing Patterson left New
Mexico, and, up to the time of the bringing of this suit, had
never returned there. The appellant Henry J. Patterson left
in 1885, and from that time until the fall of 1892 was a nonresident of New Mexico.
From 1885 to 1890 the defendants performed a large amount
of work, and expended a good deal of money on the mine in
addition to the annual assessment required by the Government of the United States thereon; but neither of the appellants ever contributed or offered to contribute any part of
the expenses of said work, or perform any labor.
In November, 1890, the defendants discovered a large body
of rich ore in the mine, and since that date have taken out
therefrom gold amounting to several hundred thousand dollars. In 1892, a corporation, known as the Old Abe Mining
Co., was organized by the defendants Hewitt, Fergusson,
Watson and others, and the ground in controversy, known as
the Old Abe ground, including the interests claimed by the appellants, was turned over to the new corporation by the trustee Hewitt, and this corporation is now holding title thereto.
The appellant Henry J. Patterson, through his agent, Henry
Burgess, had knowledge from April, 1885, that Hewitt had
refused to carry out said agreement, and execute the deed to
him and his co-complainant, and both of the appellants were
again informed after April, 1885, that Hewitt had refused to
make the said deeds or to carry out the trust agreement.
Upon this state of facts the District Court dismissed the
bill upon the ground of laches. The Supreme Court of the
Territory affirmed its action, 66 Pac. Rep. 552, and complainants appealed to this court.

complete performance by complainants, as found by the
courts below, would be sufficient to avoid the effect of the
statute.
Even if the bill does not pray the dissolution of the partnership,, it contains a prayer for general relief under which any
relief consistent with the case stated in the bill can be given,
although not specifically prayed for. Texas v. Hardenberg,

The doctrine of laches does not apply to this case. Nothing
less than the lapse of ten years provided by the statute of
New Mexico can bar complainants. Compiled Laws,, New
Mexico, 1897, ยง 2938; 1865, p. 192. And see Storms v. Ruggles, Clark's Ch. 149; Coming v. Stebbins, 1 Barb. Ch. 591;

mere delay is not sufficient unless accompanied by other acts

MR. JusTIcE BROWN, after making the foregoing statement,
delivered the opinion of the court.

The defense of laches, which prompted the dismissal of the
bill in this case, has so often been made the subject of discussion in this court that a citation of cases is quite unnecessary.
Some degree of diligence in bringing suit is required under all
systems of jurisprudence. In actions at law, the question of
diligence is determined by the words of the statute. If an
action be brought the day before the statutory time expires,
it will be sustained; if a day after, it will be defeated. In
suits in equity the question is determined by the circumstances of each particular case. The statute of limitations
consorts with the rigid principles of the common -law, but is
ill adapted to the flexible remedies of a court of equity. The
statute frequently works great practical injustice-the doctrine of laches, never. True, lapse of time is one of the chief
ingredients, but there are others of almost equal importance.
Change in the value of the property between the time the cause
of action arose and the time the bill was filed; complainant's
knowledge or ignorance of the facts constituting the cause of
action, as well as his diligence in availing himself of the means

. 318

Opinion of the Court.

195 U. S.

of knowledge within his control, are all material to be considered upon the question whether the suit was brought without unreasonable delay.
1. In the case under consideration the appellants claim the
benefit of section 2938 of the Compiled Laws of New Mexico,
to the following effect:
"No person or persons, nor their children or heirs, shall have,
sue or maintain any action or suit, either in law or equity, for
any lands, tenements or hereditaments, but within ten years
next after his, her or their right to commence, have or maintain such suit shall have come, fallen or accrued," etc.
If this were an action of ejectment at law, there seems to
be no question but what it could be maintained, since it was
brought within ten years from the time the cause of action
accrued; but where the statute is in terms applicable to suits
in equity, as well as at law, it is ordinarily construed, in cases
demanding equitable relief, as fixing a time beyond which
the suit will not under any circumstances lie, but not as precluding the defense of laches, provided there has been unreasonable delay within the time limited by the statute. In
an action at law courts are bound by the literalism of the
statute, but in equity the question of unreasonable delay
within the statutory limitation is still open. Alsop v. Riker,
155 U. S. 448, 460.
If this were not so, it would seem to follow that in the code
States, where there is but one form of action applicable both
to proceedings of a legal and equitable nature, a statute of
limitations, general in its terms, would apply to suits of both
descriptions and the doctrine of laches become practically
obsolete. This, however, is far from being the case, as questions of laches are as often arising and being discussed in the
code States as in the others. In a few cases where the statute
of limitations is made applicable in terms to suits in equity, it
has been construed as allowing a suit to be begun at any time
within the period limited by the statute, notwithstanding the
intermediate laches of the complainant, although in those

PATTERSON v. HEWITT.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

cases it will usually be found that the language of the statute
is explicit and imperative. Hill v. Nash, 73 Mississippi, 849;
Washington v. Soria, 73 Mississippi, 665.

But the weight of authority is the other way, and we consider the better rule to be that, even if the statute of limitations be made applicable in general terms to suits in equity,
and not to any particular defense, the defendant may avail
himself of the laches of the complainant, notwithstanding the
time fixed by the statute has not expired. This has been expressly held in Alabama, Scruggs v. Decatur Mineral & Land
Co., 86 Alabama, 173; in Missouri, Bliss v. Prichard,67 Missouri, 181; Kline v. Vogel, 90 Missouri, 239; and in New York,
Calhoun v. Millard, 121 N. Y. 69. In the last case the question is discussed at considerable length by Chief Judge Andrews, and the conclusion reached that "the period of limitation of equitable actions, fixed by the statute, is not, where a
purely equitable remedy is invoked, equivalent to a legislative
direction that no period short of that time shall be a bar to
relief in any case or precludes' the court from denying relief in
accordance with equitable principles for unreasonable delay,
although the full period of ten years has not elapsed since the
cause of action accrued. . .
Indeed, in some cases the diligence required is measured
by months rather than by years. Pollard v. Clayton, 1 Kay
& Johnson, 462; Attwood v. Small, 6 Clark & Finelly, 232.
And in others a delay of two, three or four years has been
held fatal. Twin-Lick Oil Co. v. Marbury, 91 U. S. 587; Hayward v. National Bank, 96 U. S. 611; Holgate v. Eaton, 116
U. S. 33; Hagerman v. Bates, 5 Colorado App. 391; Graff v.
PortlandCo., 12 Colorado App. 106.
2. The facts in this case, so far as they concern the applicability of the defense of laches, are that all prior locati6ns made
by the claimants to this land were abandoned in August, 1883,
when an oral agreement was entered into that Hewitt should
be appointed trustee for all concerned; that upon the performance of certain conditions by the parties interested he

195 U. S.

should make a deed to each of such parties as should contribute his part to the work and expense necessary to obtain
a patent; that each of the appellants contributed his share of
the work in the years 1883 and 1884-enough to entitle each
of them to a deed of his interest under the agreement; that in
April, 1885, Henry J. Patterson demanded a deed of Hewitt,
which was refused, but that C. Ewing Patterson did not demand his deed until just before the institution of this suit;
that the defendants and their associates, from the year 1885
to 1890, performed a large amount of work in developing the
mine to which neither of the appellants contributed any part;
that in November, 1890, a large body of rich ore was discovered, and since that time gold to the amount of several
hundred thousand dollars has been taken out. Both of the
appellants left the Territory of New Mexico during the year
1885, and resided abroad up to the time of the beginning of
this suit. Both were aware that Hewitt had refused to deed
them their interest in the mine and in the patent which he
in the meantime had obtained to the property.
It thus appears that the right of action accrued to the appellants in April, 1885, and that this suit was not begun until
eight years thereafter-in 1893. Whether the refusal of
Hewitt to make the deeds was right or wrong is not material
here. There is no doubt from the findings that appellants
had no share in the subsequent development of the mine or
the discovery of the ore in 1890, and that it was through the
efforts and perseverance of the defendants, and the aid they
received from Fergusson, that they were put in possession of
this valuable property. If appellants had expected a share
in this property they should either have brought a bill promptly
to enforce their rights, or at least contributed their proportionate share to the subsequent work and labor, and the expenses
then incurred. To award them now a deed to their original
interest in the property would be grossly unjust to the defendants, through whose exertions the value of the property
was discovered and the mine put upon a paying basis. While

PATTERSON v. HEWITT.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

it is true the court might impose upon the appellants the payment of their proportionate share of labor and expenses as a
condition of relief, it could not compensate the defendants for
the risk assumed by them that their exertions would come to
naught. There is no class of property more subject to sudden
and violent fluctuations of value than mining lands. A location which to-day may have no salable value may in a month
become worth its millions. Years may be spent in Working
such property apparently to no purpose, when suddenly a
mass of rich ore may be discovered, from which an immense
fortune is realized. Under such circumstance, persons having
claims to such property are bound to the utmost diligence in
enforcing them, and there is no class of cases in which the
doctrine of laches has, been more relentlessly enforced.
3. But little need be said in reply to appellants' argument,
that a trust relation was established between these parties by
the oral agreement of 1883, under which Hewitt was to take
possession, hold the property for the benefit of all concerned,
and ultimately to convey to each his proportionate share. In
this connection it is sought to apply the familiar rule that
neither laches nor the statute of limitations is applicable
against an express trust, so long as that trust continues.
Conceding all that can be claimed as to the existence of an
express parol trust in this case, the refusal of Hewitt to execute
the deed to H. J. Patterson of his interest in the property, of
which both appellants had notice, was a distinct repudiation
of such trust, which entitled the complainants to immediate
relief and opened the door to the defense of laches. Speidel

The Supreme Court of the Territory also found that the case
was within section 2916 of the Compiled Laws of the Territory,
requiring that all actions founded upon "unwritten contracts
or for relief upon the ground of fraud, and all other
actions not herein otherwise provided for and specified," shall
be brought within four years; and that this defense was not

answered by section 2930, declaring that "none of the provisions of this act shall run against causes of action originating

see no reason to question the correctness of the court's conclusion on this point.
We are clearly of the opinion that the delay of eight years

A condemnation proceeding initiated before a court in the District of
Columbia, conducted under its supervision, with power to review and
set aside the verdict of a jury, and with the right of review in an appellate

court cannot pass upon errors assigned unless the record contains a bill
of exceptions allowed and authenticated by the judge.
Parties cannot by affidavits or agreements cause that to become a bill of
exceptions which is not such in a legal sense.
UPON this record the Metropolitan Railroad Company seeks,
both by appeal and writ of error, to obtain a review of the

affirming an order of the Supreme Court of the District, which
