OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

BRADLEY v. LIGHTCAP.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 243. Argued April 21,1904.-Decided[ay 31, 1904.
1. By the law of Ilinois in respect of mortgages the legal title passes to the
mortgagee, who is entitled to possession, at least after condition broken.
The mortgagor has an equity of redemption, and, in case of foreclosure
by sale, has by statute twelve months within which to redeem by payment.
2. Where a mortgagee has rightfully taken possession of the mortgaged
premises on condition broken, the filing of a bill to foreclose is in aid of
the legal title, and not inconsistent with it.
3. Prior to the passage of a certain statute, where at the sale on foreclosure,
the mortgagee bid in the property conveyed by the mortgage at less than
the amount due, and the mortgagor did not redeem, failure by the mortgagee to take out a deed had no effect so far as the mortgagor was concerned on the original title of the mortgagee as against the mortgagor,
though it might let in the right of redemption.
4. When by a statute passed subsequently to a mortgage, and going into
effect after the mortgagee has taken possession as such, on condition
broken, it is enacted that if the mortgagee, being in possession, bids in
the mortgaged premises at sale on foreclosure at less than the amount
found due on the mortgage, and the mortgagor does not redeem, the legal
title of the mortgagee and his right of possession shall be forfeited by
failure to obtain a deed within the time prescribed to the mortgagor, who
has not redeemed or in fact paid anything in extinguishment of the mortgage, such statute impairs the obligation of the prior mortgage contract
and operates to deprive the mortgagee of property rights without due
process.

Statement of the Case.

195 U. S.

FIVE ejectment suits were brought by Lightcap against
tenants of Mrs. Bradley, July 13, 1895, in the Circuit Court
of Mason County, Illinois, and taken on change of venue to
Fulton County, where their were consolidated, Mrs. Bradley
was let in to defend, and the case went to judgment in her
favor. This judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court
of Illinois, after several hearings, and the case remanded to
the Circuit Court. 186 Illinois, 510. On the retrial judgment
was recovered by Lightcap, which was affirmed by the Supreme
Court, 201 Illinois, 511, and this writ of error prosecuted.
On the disposition of the case when brought to the Supreme
Court the second time the division of opinion among the
seven members of the court found expression. Mr. Chief Justice Magruder, Mr. Justice Carter and Mr. Justice Ricks concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Cartwright in affirmance
of the judgment. Mr. Justice Wilkin and Mr. Justice Boggs
filed dissents, and Mr. Justice Hand, while agreeing that the
legal title was in Lighteap, was of opinion that the full beneficial interest was in Mrs. Bradley, and that she, being in
possession, a court of chancery might protect her equitable
interest and possession by enjoining the prosecution of the
ejectment suit.
The facts are in substance these:
Tobias S. Bradley loaned T. B. Breedlove, June 3, 1867,
$19,616, evidenced by notes payable in one, two, three, four
and five years, respectively, and secured by a trust deed on
1,200 acres of land in Mason County, Illinois. On Bradley's
death, Lydia, his widow, became the sole owner of the trust
deed and notes. October 8, 1867, Breedlove conveyed the
1,200 acres to Prettyman, subject to the mortgage to Bradley.
August 13, 1868, Prettyman conveyed 680 acres to McCune,
and McCune gave a trust deed thereon to E. G. Johnson,
trustee, to secure the payment of $15,000, evidenced by three
notes, to the order of Lydia Bradley, and due in one, two and
three years after date. Mrs. Bradley, through her agent,
accepted these notes and trust deed as part payment of the

BRADLEY v. LIGHTOAP.
195 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

Breedlove notes and Prettyman paid the difference, and the
1,200 acres were released from the Breedlove trust deed or
mortgage.
November 13, 1868, McCune conveyed the 680 acres to
Prettyman, subject to the trust deed to Johnson. No taxes
were paid by McCune or by Prettyman, and no part of the
mortgage debt was ever paid.
May 24, 1871, Mrs. Bradley redeemed from the tax sales for
taxes of 1868 and 1869, and in 1872 for the taxes of 1871, and
she has paid all other taxes assessed on the land since the trust
deed or mortgage was given.
Early in the summer of 1871, Austin Johnson, whom Mrs.
Bradley, in July, 1870, had appointed her business agent, went
on the land on her behalf, and in 1872, Mrs. Bradley and Austin
Johnson together went upon the land and she took personal
and exclusive possession of it, which by herself and her tenants
she has retained ever since.
February 22, 1872, Mrs. Bradley filed a bill in the Circuit
Court of Mason County to set aside the release of the Breedlove
trust deed or mortgage, on the ground of fraud, and for the
foreclosure of that mortgage on the 1,200 acres for the payment of the balance of the original debt. McCune was a party
but seems to have left the State and was brought in by publication. The bill was contested, and on August 22, 1879, the
Mason Circuit Court entered a decree of foreclosure and sale
on the McCune trust deed, finding the amount due Mrs. Bradley to be $31,500. The 680 acres were sold by the master in
chancery, October 27, 1879, bid in for Mrs. Bradley for $10,000,
and a certificate was issued to her.
Mrs. Bradley proceeded to develop and improve the 680
acres, drained the tract, erected farm buildings, laid tiles,
reduced the land to cultivation, and has maintained exclusive
possession to this date.
September 4, 1893, Prettyman gave a quitclaim deed of the
land to Lightcap, which was recorded November'30, 1894.
July 13, 1895, these actions in ejectment were commenced.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Statement of the Case.

195 U. S.

The McCune trust deed or mortgage was executed August 13,
1868, and at that time chapter 57 of the Revised Statutes of
Illinois contained these sections: (see ed. 1845, p. 302).
"SEc. 12. Whenever any lands or tenements shall be sold

by virtue of any execution, it shall be the duty of the sheriff
or other officer, instead of executing the deed for the premises
sold, to give to the purchaser or purchasers of such lands or
tenements a certificate in writing describing the lands or
tenements purchased, and the sum paid therefor, or if purchased by the plaintiff in the execution, the amount of his
bid, and the time when the purchaser will be entitled to a deed
for such lands or tenements, unless the same shall be redeemed,
as is provided in this chapter, and such sheriff or other officer
shall, within ten days from such sale, file in the office of the
recorder of the county, a duplicate of such certificate, signed
by him; and such certificate, or a certified copy thereof, shall
be taken and deemed evidence of the facts therein contained.
"SEc. 13. It shall be lawful for any defendant, his heirs,
executors, administrators or grantees, whose lands or tenements shall be sold, by virtue of any execution within twelve
months from such sale, to redeem such lands or tenements,
by paying to the purchaser thereof, his executors, administrators or assigns, or to the sheriff or other officer who sold the
same, for the benefit of such purchaser, the sum of money
which may have been paid on the purchase thereof, or the
amount given or bid, if purchased by the plaintiff in the
execution, together with interest thereon at the rate of ten
per centum from the time of such sale, and on such sum being
made as aforesaid, the said sale and the certificate thereupon
granted shall be null and void."
"SEc., 22. If such lands or tenements so sold, shall not be
redeemed as aforesaid, either by the defendant or by such
creditor as aforesaid, within fifteen months from the time of
such sale, it shall be the duty of the sheriff or other officer,
who sold the same, or his successor in office, or his executors

BRADLEY v. LIGHTCAP.
195 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

,or administrators, to complete such sale, by executing a deed
to the purchaser;
"SEC. 24. In all cases hereafter, where lands shall be sold
under and by virtue of any decree of a court of equity, for the
sale of mortgaged lands, it shall be lawful for the mortgagor
of such lands, his heirs, executors, administrators or grantors
to redeem the same in the manner prescribed in this chapter,
for the redemption of lands sold by virtue of executions issued
upon judgments at common law, and judgment creditors may
redeem lands sold under any such decree in the same manner
as is prescribed for the redemption of lands, in like manner
sold upon executions issued upon judgments at common law."
The statutes contained no limitation of time within which
a sheriff's or master's deed must be taken after the period for
redemption had expired, and prescribed no penalty or loss
of right to the purchaser by reason of delay or failure in taking
out such deed.
In Rucker v. Dooley, 49 Illinois, 377, the Supreme Court of
Illinois, at its September term, 1868, reasoning by analogy,
held in an equity suit, as against a purchaser of real estate at
an execution sale, who was never in its possession, and had no
claim to it, except under his judgment and sale, and who had
taken out a sheriff's deed twenty-nine years after the sale, and
in favor of a bona fide purchaser, in possession, claiming by
mesne conveyances from the judgment debtor, that for the
protection of purchasers for a valuable consideration, Without
notice, from the judgment debtor, and those-claiming under
him, a sheriff's deed ought not to be issued after the lapse of
twenty years, and that application for a deed made after the
lapse of seven years, during which the judgment was a lien,
and fifteen months, the time given for redemption, and within
twenty years, should be made to the proper court by rule on
the sheriff and notice to the parties interested.
March 22, 1872, an act of the general assembly of Illinois
was approved, entitled "An act in regard to judgments and
decrees, and the manner of enforcing the same by execution,

and to provide for the redemption of real estate sold under
execution or decree," which went into force July 1, 1872, the
provisions of which were not materially different from those
above quoted, but section 30 was as follows, the additions to
former acts being indicated by italics:
"SEc. 30. When the premises mentioned in any such certificate shall not be redeemed in pursuance of law, the legal holder
of such certificate shall be entitled to a deed therefor at any
time within five years from the expiration of the time of redemption. The deed shall be executed by the sheriff, master in
chancery or other officer who made such sale, or by his successor in office, or by some person specially appointed by the
court for the purpose. If the time of redemption shall have
elapsed before the taking effect of this act, a deed may be given
within two years from the time this act shall take effect. When
such deed is not taken within the time limited by this act the
certificate of purchase shall be null and void; but if such deed
is wrongfully withheld by the officer whose duty it is to execute the
same, or if the execution of such deed is restrained by injunction
or order of a court or jdge, the time during which the deed is so
withheld or the execution thereof restrained shall not be taken as
any part of the five years within which said holder shall take a
deed."
Mr. John S. Miller, with whom Mr. Merritt Starr and Mr.
W. W. Hammond were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The law of the land, at the time the contract in question
was made, as recognized and enforced by the courts, providing means of enforcement of contracts, became a part
of the contract the same as though included in its terms;
and the statute of 1872, changing such law, after plaintiff
in error's contract was made and title vested thereunder,
as such law has been here construed and applied by the state
court, is a law impairing the obligations of her contract, and
is obnoxious to section 10, article 1 of the Constitution of
the United States. Tennessee v. Sneed, 96 U. S. 69; Edwards

Illinois, 654; Barnitz v. Beverly, 163 U. S. 118; Seibert v. Lewis,

657; Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 257; McCracken v.
Hayward, 2 How. 608, 613.
For the purpose of passing upon its constitutionality the
statute must be understood to mean what the court of last
resort of the State has construed it to mean. Bell v. Morrison,
1 Pet. 351; D'Wolf v. Rabaud, I Pet. 476; Van Rensselaer v.
Kearney, 11 How. 297; Tioga R. Co. v. Blossburg & C. R. Co.,

101 U. S. 665; Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586.
The English common law of mortgages was adopted in
Illinois. A mortgage is a conditional conveyance of the fee.
After condition broken, the title becomes absolute in the
mortgagee, who may recover possession as against the mortgagor. After condition broken the mortgagor has only an
equity of redemption. After decree of foreclosure and sale,
the right of redemption was limited to twelve months from
the sale, and if not exercised within that time, it was barred.
Stephens v. Ill. Mut. Ins. Co., 43 Illinois, 327. The estates
in the land remain the same in such case, with the qualification
that the amount and time of redemption are absolutely fixed
by the decree and sale. Stephens v. Ill. Mut. Ins. Co., supra;
Wedgbury v. Cassell, 164 Illinois, 622.
Such was the law of the State as promulgated by the courts
of last resort at and before the date of the mortgage contract
in question in this case. Williams v. Brunton, 3 Gilm. 600,
622; Kruse v. Scripps, 11 Illinois, 98, 104; Carrollv. Ballance,

195 U. S.

The right of the mortgagor, or his grantees, to redeem after
condition broken is a purely equitable right-the creation of
courts of chancery; and can only be asserted in a court of
equity. It could not be recognized in a court of law in an
ejectment suit, as is done in the case at bar. Kenyon v.
Shreck, 52 Illinois, 382, 386; Bracken v. Cooper, 80 Illinois,
221, 231; Mulvey v. Gibbons, 87 Illinois, 367, 383.
His right of redemption after sale and under the statute
was only upon the absolute condition of making full payment,
within a prescribed time, of the bid, interest and costs.
And so the law of Illinois remained after said date, and,
still remains and is enforced in cases where said statute of
1872 does not apply to change it. Kelgour v. Wood, 64 Illinois,
345; Vallette v. Bennett, 69 Illinois, 632; Harper v. Ely, 70
Illinois, 581; Oldham v. Pfleger, 84 Illinois, 102; Davis v.
Conn. Mut. L. I. Co., 84 Illinois, 508; Mulvey v. Gibbons, 87
Illinois, 367, 382; Fitch v. Wetherbee, 110 Illinois, 475, 487;
Smith v. Mace, 137 Illinois, 68, 74; Esker v. Heffernan, 159
Illinois, 38; Walker v. Warner, 179 Illinois, 16, 23; Ware v.
Schintz, 190 Illinois, 189, 193; Farrarv. Payne, 73 Illinois,
83, 88; Stone v. Tyler, 173 Illinois, 147, 155.
The legal title here passed to Johnson, the grantee in the
trust deed, and became absolute in him as trustee for plaintiff
in error, on condition broken, which occurred as early as 1869.
That legal title in Johnson, trustee, was not divested and
revested in the mortgagor, or affected, by the foreclosure
decree in equity and sale thereunder, unless such effect of
divesting a title is given to the statute of 1872 here in question.
By the law of Illinois, as promulgated and enforced by the
courts of last resort at and prior to the date of said mortgage
contract, if the mortgagor and his grantees failed to redeem
the mortgaged premises from foreclosure sale within the time
limited by the statute, and the decree of foreclosure, his equity
of redemption was barred and foreclosed, and thereafter he
had no further right, title or claim in or to the premises.

Brown, 11 Illinois, 519; Fitch v. Wetherbee, 110 Illinois, 475, 487.
Defendant in error could only recover in this ejectment
suit on the strength of his own title. Hague v. Porter, 45
Illinois, 318; Vallette v. Bennett, 69 Illinois, 632; Hammond v.
Shepard, 186 Illinois, 235.
But on the other hand, defendant in error could not recover
even if he had the legal title, while plaintiff in error rightfully
held the possession of the land under a complete equitable
title. Stow v. Russell, 36 Illinois, 18, 36; Staley v. Murphy,
47 Illinois, 241, 245; Kilgour v. Gockley, 83 Illinois, 109; Sands
v. Wacaser, 149 Illinois, 530, 534.
As construed by the Supreme Court of Illinois in the case
at bar, the statute of 1872 has so changed the law as it existed
at the date of the mortgage contract that notwithstanding
the mortgagor and those claiming under him did not redeem
said premises from said sale according to law, when the certificate of purchase became void, the title to said premises must,
in order to give practical effect to said statute, be still in
the mortgagor or in the defendant in errof claiming under
him.
For the purpose of determining whether it infringes the
Constitution, as claimed, the statute must be understood to
mean what the courts of last resort of the State have construed it to mean. Bell v. Morrison, 1 Pet. 351; D'Wolf v.
Rabaud, 1 Pet. 476; Van Rensselaer v. Kearney, 11 How. 297;
Tioga R. Co. v. Blossburg & C. R. Co., 20 Wall. 137; Townsend
v. Todd, 91 U. S. 452; Scipio v. Wright, 101 U. $. 665; Smyth
v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466.
By the law of Illinois, at the time this mortgage was executed,
the fee of the land was conveyed by the mortgagor to the
trustee, Johnson, for the use of Mrs. Bradley. The condition

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

195 U. S.

of the mortgage was immediately broken, as soon as made,
by failure to pay taxes previously and then due, no taxes
having ever been paid by the mortgagor, and again by failure
to -pay the notes maturing in 1869, 1870 and 1871. After
condition broken the title became absolute in the mortgagee,
and so it was at the time of the enactment of the statute of
1872.
A statutory bar does not satisfy a debt, annul a contract,
or deprive the holder of security. Keener v. Crull, 19 Illinois,
189, 191; Newland v. Marsh, 19 Illinois, 376, 384; McCagg v.
Heacock, 42 Illinois, 153; Brockman v. Sieverling, 6 Illinois A.
512; Hancock v. Franklin Ins. Co., 114 Massachusetts, 155;
Moses v. St. Paul, 67 Alabama, 168; Wheelan v. Kinsley, 26
Ohio St. 131; Waterman v. Brown, 31 Pa. St. 161; Kemp v.
Westbrook, 1 Ves. 278.
If plaintiff in error had a right of entry as against the mortgagor in 1872, when condition was broken and she made her
peaceable entry, the statute of 1872, which the Supreme Court
of Illinois says is merely a statute of limitation, cannot have
destroyed or changed that right of possession without invading the Constitution, for laches will not be imputed to one
in the peaceable possession of land. Mills v. Lockwood, 42
Illinois, 111, 118; Dorman v. Dorman, 187 Illinois, 154, 160;
Wilson v. Byers,'77 Illinois, 76, 84; Boyd v. Boyd, 163 Illinois,
611, 615; Beck Lumber Co. v. Rupp, 188 Illinois, 562, 570;
Parkerv. Shannon, 137 Illinois, 376, 392; Bush v. Stanley, 122
Illinois, 406, 418.
A constitutional statute of limitation does not run against
or affect a possessor of real estate, but one out of possession.
This was the law of Illinois when this mortgage deed was made.
Mills v. Lockwood (1866), 42 Illinois, 111, 119; Parker v.
Shannon (1891), 137 Illinois, 376, 392.
Such a change in the law, as here applied, deprives plaintiff
in error of the right, title and interest vested in her under the
laws of the State as they existed at the date of her mortgage
and when condition was broken and when she took possession,

and violates the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment
of the Federal Constitution. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago, 166 U. S. 226; Scott v. McNeal,

Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U. S. 204, 222.
If the constitutional guaranties referred to protect plaintiff
in error from the divestiture of her title, either by the statute
of 1872 or by the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois,
she has such an equitable title as is contemplated by the
statute of 1835, quoted in our statement of questions involved,
and having been in possession, by actual residence thereon by
her tenants, since 1872 and paid all the taxes, and for more than
seven successive years from and after the expiration of the
period of redemption (when her equitable title became complete),-she is protected by said statute from defendant in
error's action. Irving v. Brownell, 11 Illinois, 402; Collins v.
Smith, 18 Illinois, 160; Martin v. Judd, 81 Illinois, 488; Dolton
v. Cain, 14 Wall. 472; Gregg v. Tesson, 66 U. S.150; Dredge v.
Forsyth; 67 U. S.563.
Mr. George W. Wall and Mr. E. A. Wallace, with whom
Mr. Lyman Lacey, Jr., was on the brief, for defendant in error:
See § 30, ch. 77, laws of Illinois; it is a statute of limitations.
Ryhiner v. Frank, 105 Illinois, 326, 330; Petterson v. Emerson,

511, 519.
The Legislature of a State has the right to enact statutes
of limitation, and it is no objection to their validity that they
are made to apply to existing rights, provided a reasonable
time be given in future for complying with the statute, and
under repeated decisions of this court, the statute complained
of is not unconstitutional. Wheeler v. Jackson, 137 U. S.245,

Pet. 45, 64; Vance v. Vance, 108 U. S. 514.
In Illinois the title to land mortgaged is not out of the
mortgagor, except as between him and the mortgagee, and then
only as an incident of the mortgage debt for the sole purpose
of obtaining satisfaction; as to all other persons, and for all
other purposes, the mortgagor is the legal owner of the mortgaged premises, and in the case at bar, the Supreme Court of
Illinois merely adheres to the law of the State, as it always has
existed therein. Fitch v. Pinckard, 4 Scam. 69, 83; Ryan
v. Dunlap, 17 Illinois, 40; Sargent v. Howe, 21 Illinois, 149;
Vansant v. Allmon, 23 Illinois, 30; Hall v. Lance, 25 Illinois,
250; Harris v. Mills, 28 Illinois, 44, 46; Pollock v. Maison, 41

190 Illinois, 189; Hughes v. Edwards, 9 Wheat. 497; Hutchinson
v. King, 1 Wall. 53.
While the mortgage conveys to the mortgagee a legal title,
it is only a limited or qualified legal title, and neither before
nor after condition broken does the mortgagee have the "absolute legal title" under the law of Illinois. On the contrary
it is only a base or determinable fee. Independent of the
debt, which the mortgage is given to secure, he has no title
whatever. When the debt is paid, released, discharged or
barred by the statute of limitations or in any way satisfied,
the mortgagee's title is extinguished by operation of law.
Cases cited supra and Waughop v. Bartlett, 165 Illinois, 124,
132; Speer v. Hadduck, 31 Illinois, 439, 443; Bogardus v. Moses,
181 Illinois, 554.
The title, which the mortgagee gets by the mortgage, can
be used by him for one and only one purpose, viz.: as a means
for the collection of the debt secured, or so much thereof as
the mortgaged premises, when resorted to for that purpose,
will satisfy. A valid foreclosure of the mortgage by a decree
of a court of equity in a foreclosure suit, followed by a valid

BRADLEY v. LIGHTCAP.

sale in pursuance of the decree, extinguishes the mortgage lien

MR. CHIEF JUSTIcE FULLER, after making the foregoing
statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

Among the defences, it is stated Mrs. Bradley relied on, were
that "under section 6 of chapter 83 of the Revised Statutes,
in regard to limitations, the trust deed from McCune to Johnson, the decree of sale and certificate of purchase constituted
color of title which, coupled with her possession and payment
of taxes for seven successive years, made her the legal owner
of the lands to the extent and according to the purport of her
paper title;" that "under section 4 of the same act her possession and actual residence, through her tenants, for seven
successive years, having a connected title in law or equity
deducible of record from the United States, by virtue of the
same trust deed, decree and sale, barred the action of plaintiff;" and "that she was mortgagee in possession after condition broken and entitled to possession as such." The Supreme Court of Illinois overruled all these defences, and held

BRADLEY v. LIGHTCAP.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

that when the sale was made under the decree and the mortgagee purchased at the sale, the mortgage was satisfied as to
the land, and all rights of the mortgagee were represented by
the certificate of purchase, and that, by force of the act of
1872, the mortgagee having failed to take the deed within
the time limited by the statute, the certificate became null
and void, her title terminated as it would on redemption, and
she ceased to have any interest whatever in the premises, so
that the mortgagor or his grantees, without any payment of
the mortgage debt, was entitled to recover the possession from
the mortgagee, in ejectment, on the strength of a perfect title.
Before and when the trust deed to Johnson, which may be
treated as if a mortgage to Mrs. Bradley, was given, the legal
title passed to the mortgagee according to the law of Illinois
in respect of mortgages.
After condition broken the mortgagee became entitled to
possession of the mortgaged premises and could maintain an
action of ejectment. The mortgagor had only an equity of
redemption, and in case of sale on foreclosure had by statute
the right to redeem within twelve months by making full
payment.
The law in -general as it is to-day was thus declared in Ware
v. Schintz, 190 Illinois, 189, 193:
"Under the repeated rulings of this court a mortgagee, as
against the mortgagor, is held, as in England, in law, to be
the owner of the fee, having the jus in re as well as ad rem, and
entitled to all the rights and remedies which the law gives to
such owner, and may, after condition broken, maintain ejectment against the mortgagor. The mortgagor or his assignee,
however, is the legal owner of the mortgaged estate as against
all persons excepting the mortgagee or his assigns. Delahay
v. Clement, 3 Scam. 201; Vansant v. Allmon, 23 Illinois, 30;

in the nature of a base or determinable fee. The term of its

existence is measured by that of the mortgage debt. When
the latter is paid or becomes barred by the statute of limitations the mortgagee's title is extinguished by operation of
law. Pollock v. Maison, 41 Illinois, 516; Harrisv. Mills, 28
Illinois, 44; Gibson v. Rees, 50 Illinois, 383; Barrettv. Hinckley,
124 Illinois, 32; Lightcap v. Bradley, 186 Illinois, 510. Until
it is extinguished the legal title is in the mortgagee for the
purpose of obtaining satisfaction of his debt."
The condition of the McCune mortgage was broken as soon
as made by failure to pay taxes previously and then due, and
again by failure to pay the notes maturing in 1869, 1870 and
1871, and Mrs. Bradley entered into peaceable possession of
the tract of six hundred and eighty acres before the act of
1872 took effect. If the assent of the mortgagor was necessary, which we do not hold it was, it should be implied in the
circumstances. Her possession was that of mortgagee in possession, and she could defend as against the owner of the equity
of redemption any action except for an accounting of the rents
and profits, and to redeem. And as she could pursue concurrent remedies the character of her possession was not
affected by the filing and pendency of the bill to set aside the
release of the Breedlove mortgage. But that bill went to
decree in 1879 of foreclosure of the McCune mortgage by sale,
and sale was had. There was no independent purchaser, nor
was the whole amount of the mortgage debt bid, but Mrs.
Bradley, the mortgagee in possession, bid about one-third
of the amount due. By the statute the right of redemption
of McCune and his grantee was barred and determined October 27, 1880, at the expiration of twelve months from the
date of sale, and so it was by the express provision of the
decree of foreclosure.
The certificate of purchase was issued to Mrs. Bradley, but
it does not appear that she obtained a deed. It is assumed,
and we assume, that she did not, although it is suggested that
after the lapse of so many years, and under the circumstances,
in an action at law by the original mortgagor against the

BRADLEY v. LIGHTCAP.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

mortgagee in possession, an irrebutable presumption of a deed
arises on grounds of public policy.
The Supreme Court of Illinois in the present case decides
that the act of 1872 applies to mortgagees in possession, and
that it operates not simply as a statute of limitations on the
right to obtain a deed, but in effect as a statute forfeiting, by
the nullification of the certificate, the mortgagee's estate and
right of possession by reason of laches, and means that if a
deed be not taken out within the time specified, the mortgagee has lost his debt and the mortgagor has been reinstated
in his former title by operation of law, and without having
paid anything in redemption. Accepting the construction of
the act by the state court, and its conclusion that it applies
to Mrs. Bradley, then the question is whether such a statute
so applied does not impair the obligation of the contract
previously existing between the mortgagee and the 'mortgagor, or deprive the mortgagee of property rights without
due process. That question was raised in the Supreme Court
of Illinois, and the court held that it did not. 201 Illinois,
511.
Confessedly subsequent laws, which in their operation
amount to the denial of rights accruing by a prior contract,
are obnoxious to constitutional objection.
In Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311, the statute objected to
gave the mortgagor twelve months to redeem after the sale,
and Mr. Chief Justice Taney said:
"It declares that, although the mortgaged premises should
be sold under the decree of the Court of Chancery, yet that
the equitable estate of the mortgagor shall not be extinguished, but shall continue for twelve months after the sale;
and it moreover gives a new and like estate, which before had
no existence, to the judgment creditor, to continue for fifteen
months. If such rights may be added to the original contract
by subsequent legislation, it would be difficult to say at what
point they must stop. . . . Any such modification of a
contract by subsequent legislation, against the consent of

one of the parties, unquestionably impairs its obligations;
and is prohibited by the Constitution."
In Barnitz v. Beverly, 163 U. S. 118, it was held that a state
statute which authorized redemption of property sold in
foreclosure of a mortgage where no such right previously
existed, or extended the period of redemption beyond the
time previously allowed, could not apply to a sale under a
mortgage executed before its passage, and Mr. Justice Shiras,
referring to Brine v. Insurance Company, 96 U. S. 627, 637,
said:
"But this court held, through Mr. Justice Miller, that all
the laws of a State existing at the time a mortgage or any
other contract is made, which affect the rights of the parties
to the contract, enter into and become a part of it, and are
obligatory on all courts which assume to give a remedy on
such contracts,

.

.

.

that it is therefore said that these

laws enter into and become a part of the contract "-and that
" 'the remedy subsisting in a State when and where a contract is made and is to be performed is a part of its obligation.' "

.

"What we are now considering is, whether the change of
remedy was detrimental to such a degree as to amount to an
impairment of the plaintiff's right; and, as this record discloses that the sale left a portion of the plaintiff's judgment
unpaid, it may be fairly argued that this provision of the act
[which provided that the land 'shall not again be liable for
sale for any balance'] does deprive the plaintiff of a right
inherent in her contract. When we are asked to put this case
within the rule of those cases in which we have held that it is
competent for the States to change the form of a remedy, or
to modify it otherwise, as they may see fit, provided no substantial right secured by the contract is thereby impaired,
we are bound to consider the entire scheme of the new statute,
and to have regard to its probable effect on the rights of the
parties."
In Hooker v. Burr, 194 U. S. 415, these and many other

BRADLEY v. LIGHTCAP.

Opinion of the Court.

cases were considered, and the distinction was pointed out
between a purchase by the mortgagee and by an independent
purchaser, having no connection whatever with the original
contract between the mortgagor and mortgagee, and whose
contract was made under the law as then existing; as well as
the distinction where the mortgagee bids the whole amount
of the mortgage debt, as in Connecticut .MutualLife Insurance
Company v. Cushman, 108 U. S. 51, which was cited with
approval. There the company bid enough to pay the full
amount of the mortgage debt, principal and interest, and on
redemption contended that it was entitled to interest at the
rate existing at the time of the execution of the mortgage,
which had been reduced before the sale, though subsequent
to the mortgage. Barnitz v. Beverly, was distinguished. In
that case the sum bid at the foreclosure sale did not equal
the amount due on the mortgage, the debt of the mortgagor
was not thereby paid, and it was the mortgagee's rights under
her contract as contained in the mortgage, and not her rights
as a purchaser, that were in controversy. In the Cushman
case, on the contrary, the amount bid at the foreclosure sale
paid the mortgage debt, and the subsequent position of the
mortgagee was as a purchaser only.
And we said: "If the mortgage had been foreclosed and
the mortgagee had thereby realized his debt, principal and
interest in full, upon the sale, there can be no doubt that he
would not have been heard to assert the invalidity of the subsequent legislation, nor would an independent purchaser at
the sale have been heard to make the same complaint. Of
course, this does not include the case of a mortgagee who
purchases at the foreclosure sale and bids a price sufficient to
pay his mortgage debt in full with interest, and an action
thereafter commenced against him to set aside the sale be-.
cause it was made in violation of legislation subsequent to
the mortgage. In such case we suppose there can be no doubt
of the right of the mortgagee to assert, as a defence to the
action, the unconstitutionality of the subsequent legislation

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

195 U. S.

as an impairment of his contract contained in the mortgage."
In Illinois the legal title vests in the mortgagee, but in
equity that title is regarded as a trust estate to secure the
payment of the money, and where the mortgaged premises
are bid off by the mortgagee, at foreclosure sale, for the full
amount of the decree, interest and costs, the mortgage may
be held to have expended its force, but where the bid is for
less than the full amount, a different rule would be applicable.
Bogardus v. Moses, 181 Illinois, 554, 559, 560.
Entitled to pursue different remedies to collect the mortgage debt or to free the mortgaged premises of the right of
redemption, foreclosure and sale, purchase and deed are in
aid of the original title and not inconsistent with it. Williams
v. Brunton, 3 Gilm. (Ill.) 600. If the right of redemption is
determined by efflux of time, which must be before a deed
can issue, failure to take out the deed either has no effect so
far as the mortgagor is concerned because he is not injured,
or the right of redemption still remains and all the mortgagor
can claim is that the relation between the parties is unchanged.
In the present case there was no independent purchaser; the
bid of the mortgagee was less than one-third of the amount
found. due; there was no redemption and the right of redemption was cut off; the mortgagee was in possession before and
at the time of foreclosure and sale, and when ejectment was
brought sixteen years thereafter, and the mortgage debt had
never in fact been paid; so that the original mortgagor as
plaintiff in ejectment could not recover unless by the subsequent law the mortgagee had been subjected to the loss of
all her rights, as against him, by laches in obtaining a deed,
although as a general rule laches are not imputable to a party
in possession to the loss of the right thereto.
And if the operation of the subsequent law is to impair the
obligation of Mrs. Bradley's mortgage contract or to deprive
her of rights protected by the Constitution, we cannot decline
jurisdiction because of a construction that we deem untenable.

BRADLEY v. LIGHTCAP.
195 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Louisville Gas Company v. Citizens' Gas Light Company, 115
U. S. 683, 697; Terre Haute & Indianapolis Railroad Company
v. Indiana, 194 U. S. 579.
By the judgment in this case Lightcap has been held clothed
with the legal title and the immediate right of possession.
And this on the ground that the certificate of purchase discharged the McCune mortgage and that the act of 1872 nullified
the certificate after the lapse of five years. This gave tb the
limitation of time for taking out the deed the effect of destroying the right of possession taken under the mortgage, wiping
out the mortgage with the certificate, and allowing the mortgagor to assert the legal title and right of possession as against
the mortgagee as a wrongdoer. That is to say, though Mrs.
Bradley was rightfully in possession and though the mortgage
debt had not in fact been paid, the bar of the statute as to the
deed is held to be efficacious in turning Mrs. Bradley into a
trespasser as respects the mortgagor, who, not having in fact
paid anything, is treated as having made payment by the
mortgagee's bid, and being at the same time entitled to assert
the failure of the purchase by reason of laches in taking out
the deed.
'And yet because a statute may take away the sword which
a deed would give a mortgagee out of possession, it does not
follow that it can lawfully operate on prior transactions so as
to take away the shield afforded by possession. Rightful
possession is a defence in ejectment, Sands v. Wacaser, 149
Illinois, 530, 533, and cases cited, and Mrs. Bradley's possession could only be treated as wrongful as against the original
mortgagor by the application of the subsequent law.
As we have said, when Mrs. Bradley took this mortgage
there was no statutory limitation as to the time within which
a master's deed must be taken out, and no loss of right by
reason of failure to do so was prescribed. After she had filed
her bill, and while she was in possession, the act of 1872 went
into effect, and, it may be conceded, limited Mrs. Bradley's
right to obtain a deed on foreclosure sale and so far affected

any remedy through a deed she might have had. But, reading
the act, as the view of the Supreme Court compels us to do,
as taking away her right to maintain her possession, we are
of opinion that it materially impairs the obligation of her
contract, and deprives her of property without due process.
Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

After the decision reported 186 Illinois, 510, Mrs. Bradley
filed her bill in equity in the Circuit Court of Fulton County,
Illinois, to quiet her title to the land in controversy in the
action in ejectment and for appropriate relief. The bill was
dismissed on demurrer and Mrs. Bradley carried the case to
the Supreme Court of Illinois, which affirmed the decree below.
