Opinion of the Court.

France, November, 30, 1876, and in Belgium, February 28,
1877. The specification and drawing and. claims of the
patent are as follows:
"To all whom it may concern:
"Be it known that we, Leonard Yeller, of Ludwigshafenon-the-Rhine, in the state of Bavaria, and Edmund Hfofmann, of Mannheim, in the state of Baden, Germany, have invented certain new and useful improvements in the .art of
making beer, and we hereby declare the following to be a full,
clear, and exact description thereof, reference being had to the
accompanyipg drawing, making a part of this specification, in
which the figure represents an end view of our: apparatus,
with the water column in section.

"Heretofore, in brewing beer, after cooking and cooling,
the beer has been put into open vessels to ferment. The
fermentation lasts, say fifteen days, and then the beer is
drawn off from the yeast into large casks nearly closed, where
it remains from one to six months to settle, and among the
sediment there will still remain some yeast. The beer is then
pumped into shavings casks and, is mixed with young beer,
(kraeusen,) which starts a mild fermentation, lasting from ten
to fifteen days, until the generation of the gas is reduced to a
minimuih. During this fermentation the beer effervesces
through means of the carbonic acid gas rising, and the lighter
particles of yeast and solid matter are thrown to the top,
forming a foam, which, during the ebullition, runs over the
edges *of the opening in the cask, and carrying along a small
portion (more or less) of the beer, which is wasted, and this
waste has to be. replaced by refilling with new beer daily.
This wastage we estimate, from practical experience in tl.
manufacture, to be about one barrel in every forty, more or
less. This waste beer, running down around the casks and on
the floor of the cellars, sours and produces a mildew, which
impregnates the air with foul vapors highly injurious to the
workinen, and, permeating the beer in the casks, alters its
flavor and, in instances where the mildewf penetrates the wood
of the casks, spoils the beer entirely. This fouling of the barrels requires that they should be washed outside, from time to

OCTOBER TERM, 1886.
Opinion of the Court.

time, and the water used'in this washing always raises- the
temperature of the cellar, and wastes the ice which is therein
packed to keep the temperature about 410 Fahenheit. After
the beer has been in the shavings cask from ten to fifteen days,
the gelatine or other clarifying medium is introduced, and at
the end of a couple cof days the beer is entirely clear. The
shavings cask is then bunged up tightly for from three to five
days, to confine the last portions of the rising carbonic acid
gas. This charges the beer with carbonic acid gas (002), so asto make it merchaiitable, and it must be drawn off at once into
kegs and used, otherwise the pressure on the shavings cask
may burst it.
"In selecting the time for drawing off the beer from the
shavings casks into the kegs, to send it to market, the beer
should never be under a pressure of over seven pounds to the
s'quare inch, otherwise the keg fills with foam in the drawing
off, and the bubbles subsiding leaves an air-space over the
liquid beer, which absorbs a portion of the carbonic acid gas
and soon leaves the beer in the keg fiat. As the art is now
practised, arriving at the proper degree of pressure when to
put the beer in kegs is merely a matter of judgment or guess
by the foreman, and no two shavings casks will be drawn off
at precisely the same pressure, and the effervescing qualities
of the beer 'Will vary considerable, much to the detriment of
sales by the brewer. If the beer is not put in market at once
at this stage, the bungs have to be removed from the casks
and the gas allowed to escape. Then the escaping gas stirs
up the yeast and impurities that, have settled to the bottom,
and the beer has to go again through the entire shavings-cask
step in the process.
"Under the processes now in use, it requires about twenty
days to-put beer on the market after it is pumped into the
shavings casks. This delay requires brewers to keep a large
amount of capital invested during the time in unfinished beer,
and it is highly important to decrease this time of preparation.

"The object of our invention is to overcome the difficulties
above named, and also to produce in a shorter time a better
quality of beer, containing more sugar and less alcohol.
"Our invention consists in treating the beer when in the
shavings-cask step of the process, in one or more closed casks,
under automatically controllable carbonic acid gas pressure,
generated eithei' by the mild fermentation of the beer or artificially. This equalizes the pressure in such cask or series of
casks, and the effervescing quality of the beer in all the casks,'
when .two or more are connected together, is :niform.
"The cask or casks being closed, none of the beer wastes
by running over, and the foul smells and washing of the casks
and cellars are avoided. The escaping carbonic acid gas is
conducted from the relief-valve to the open air, and does not
settle in the brewing cellars, to endanger life.
"Our invention consists, further, in similarly treating the
beer when in the ' kraeusen' stage, or sulisequently thereto, or
both, or when in the settling-casks, ('ru-beer,') this being the
second fermenting stage -that is to say, our invention consists in so treating the beer at any time or times previous to
racking off and bunging or bottling.
"In order that those skilled in the art may-make and use
our invention, we will proceed to describe the manner in which
we have carried it out.
"In the drawings A A are shavings casks, having faucets%
a a, provided with valves i i, inserted tightly in their bungs.
These faucets are connected to taps N on the main pipe a', by
means of flexible sections, k, provided with couplings. The
taps or connections have valves i' . Pipe a' bends upward and
passes above the level of a water column, 0, and then, passing
downward, enters the base of the 'column at w, where it is provided with a cock, b/. The water column or vessel 0 has a
faucet, d, to draw off water, when desired to decrease the
pressure. A depending branch-pipe, e, and cock, e1, serve to

discharge any condensed moisture from pipe a, and a pressuregauge, e2, serves to inlicate the pressure.
"By means of a gas-generator, located at A and connected
to pipe a by means of pipef, having cock g, we are enabled to
test the joints of the apparatus and drive all atmospheric air
from the pipes when the operation begins.
"At the top of the water column is a conical cap terminating in a pipe, E, which is projected out of the building and
leads all the gas into the open air. located within this cap is
a- conical diaphragm, C', centrally located, so that, should the
escape of the gas become so rapid as to lift the body of water
-upward, the water will be arrested by the diaphragm, while
the gas escapes around its edges.
"It is Qvident that the pressure in all the shavings casks
connected with pipe a' will be equal, and will be kept so indefinitely by means of the water column, and, as far as the enlivening of the beer is concerned, it is always ready for market,
be it ten days or four months, whereas in processes now practised beer has to be bunged at a particular time for a particular day's market.
"Our process enables the brewer to keep on hand merchantable beer, which can be shipped instantly, or, if trade decreases,
it enables him to keep his stock on hand without deterioratidn
till the demand is made for it.
",All that.has been said above in relation to a series of casks
applies, of course, equally to treatment in a single cask.
"It is obviQus that means other than a water column may
be adopted for equalizing the pressure of the gas, without
departing from the spirit of our invention -as, for example,
safety-valves and the like -and the apparatus is susceptible
of many other variations without affecting the process itself,
which constitutes the essence of our invention.
"By using our process we are enabled to clarify the beer
and clear it of impurities in eight days or less, whereas in the
ordinary process it takes from twelve to twenty days. This
immense gain in time we ascriba to the following action: The
air being forced out of the pipes, the- carbonic acid fills them
and the space in the casks above the beer. Then. the gas

Opinion of the Court.

slowly accumulates in the space above the beer until the pres.
sure above is such as to overcome the density of the beer and
reenter it, so as to charge it up to the pressure for which the
column is set. This creates, in a manner, an eqtiilibrium between the rising bubbles and the pressure above, during which
gravity can act rapidly on the yeast and impurities in the beer
and carry them down among the shavings at the bottom of
the cask, where they remain.
"We introduce the clarifying gelatine into the shavings
casks after the beer is introduced, and before connecting with
pipe a', and actual practice has demonstrated to us that to clarify the beer by our process requires only about one-half of the
gelatine heretofore used. This saving, together with the saving of the waste beer heretofore mentioned, (one or more
barrels in every forty,) and the saving of labor, will greatly
cheapen the production of beer.
"'When we desire to make beer for bottling, we attach our
apparatus to the settling casks filled with beer, and no young
beer (kraeusen) is added, but a little gelatine is added and the
beer allowed to remain for from fourteen to twenty days,
until it becomes 'lively,' (saturated with CO,,) and it is then
bottled.
"We find that bottled beer prepared this way is healthier,
and will last in good condition two or three months, whereas
the beer bottled in the usual manner with kraeusen beer lasts
only for eight or ten days, if pure and not steamed after bottling, the latter spoiling the aroma and flavor.
"Having thus described our invention, what we claim as
new, and desire to secure by letters-patent, is "'1. The process of preparing beer for the market, which
consists in holding it under controllable pressure of carbonic
acid gas when in the 'kraeusen' stage, substantially as set

The principal contest in the case is as to the validity of the
patent, as a patent for a process. The state of the art of
brewing beer, so far as it concerns the invention of the patentees, is set. forth in the specification. That invention, so far as
it is applicable to what is called the kraeusen stage 6f beer, is
applicable to the beer after it is pumped into the shavings
casks and the kraeusen beer is added for the purpose of start-

ing a mild fermentation. By the old process, the fermentation
lasted from ten to fifteen -days, until the generation of the gas
was reduced to a minimum. By the rising of the carbonic
acid gas through the effervescence of the7 beer, a foam wa,
formed, which ran over the edges of the open bung-hole and
wasted more or less of the beer, say one barrel in every forty.
This waste beer soured and mildewed, produced foul vapors
injurious to health, altered the flavor of the beer in the casks,
and sometimes spoiled it entirely. The washing of the barrels
on the outside was required, the temperature of the cellar was
raised by the use of the water for the washing, and the ice
was wasted which was packed in the cellar to keep the temperature at about 410 Fahrenheit. After the beer had been in
the shavings casks from ten to fifteen days, gelatine or some
other clarifying medium was introduced, and at the end of a
couple of days the beer was entirely clear. The shavings cask
was then bunged up tightly for from three to five days, to
confine the last portions of the rising carbonic acid gas, and
charge.the beer with it to make it merchantable. The proper
degree of pressure ;n the shavings cask at which to draw off
the beer into kegs for market was a matter of-judgment in the
workman. If the pressure was over seven pounds to the
square inch, the keg filled with foam in drawing it off and the
bubbles subsiding left an air space over the liquid beer, which
absorbed a portion of the carbonic acid gas, and soon left the
beer in the keg flat. As a result of the fact that the proper
degree of pressure was merely a matter of judgment, no two
shavings casks were drawn off at precisely the same pressure,
and the effervescing qualities of the beer would vary considerably. If the beer was not put into market at once, at the
proper stage, the bungs had to be removed from the shavings
casks and the gas allowed to escape. The escaping gas then
stirred up the yeast and impurities which had settled at the
bottom, and the beer had to go again through the entire
shavings-cask stage in the process. It required about twenty,
days to put beer on the market after it was pumped into the
shavings casks. This delay required brewers to keep a large
amount of capital invested during the time in unfinished bqer,

and a decrease of this time of preparation was highly important.
Upon these premises, the 'object of the invention of the patentees was to overcome the difficulties above named. In this
view, the statement of the invention in the specification is in
these 'vords: "Our invention consists in treating the beer
.when in the shavings-cask step of the process in one or more
closed casks under automatically controlled carbonic acid gas
pressure, generated either by the mild fermentation of the
beer or artificially. This equalizes the pressure in such cask
or series of casks, and the effervescing quality of the beer in
all the casks, when two or more are connected together, is
uniform. The cask or casks being closed, none of the beer
wastes by running over, and the foul smells, and washing of
the tasks and cellars are avoided. The escaping carbonic acid
gas is conducted from the relief-valve to the open air, and does
not settle in the brewing cellars, to endanger life." This is
fairly to be read as a statement that the beer is to be thus
treated during the whole of its subjection to the shaving-s-casks
stage of the process, whether in one closed cask or in two or
more closed casks connected together. The statement is, that
the cask or casks are to be closed, that is, closed throughout
the shavings-casks stage of the process, and kept during that
process under automatically controllable carbonic acid gas
pressure, generated either by the mild fermentation of the
beer or artificially. It is also stated, that none of the beer
wastes by running over, and that the foul smells and washing
of -the casks and cellars are avoided, and that the escaping
carbonic acid gas is conducted to the open air. These consequences cannot follow, nor can the advantages of the invention set forth be fully availed of, unless the casks are closed
from the beginning of the shavings-cask kraeusen stage. Adequate means for working this process and securing this result
are set forth in the specification; also, means for connecting
together a series of shavings casks, so as to secure equal pressure in all of them.
The specification further says: "By using our process we are
enabled to clarify the beer and clear it of impurities in eight

FERMENTATION CO: v. - MAUS.
Opinion of the Court.

days or less, whereas in the ordinary process it"takes-from
twelve to twenty days: This immense gain in time we ascribe
to the following action: The air being forced out of the pipes,
the carbonic acid fills them and the space in the casks above
the-beer. Then the gas slowly accumulates in the spa'ce above
the beer until the pressure above is such as to overcome the
density of the beer and reenter it, so as to charge it up to
the pressure for which the column is set. This creates, in a
manfier, an equilibrium between the rising bubbles and thepressure .above, during which gravity can act rapid.y on the
yeast and impurities in the beer and carry them down among
the shavings at the bottom of the cask, where they remain.
"We introduce the clarifying gelatine into the shavings
casks after the beer is introduced, 'and before connecting with
pipe a', and actual practice has demonstrated to us that to clarify
the beer by our process requires only about one-half of the
gelatine heretofore used. This saving, together with the saving of the waste beer heretofore mentioned, (one or more barrels in 'every forty,) and the saving of labor, will greatly
cheapen the production of beer."
The third claim of the patent is as follows: "3. The process of preparing and preserving beer for the market, which
consists -n holding it under controllable pressure of carbonic
acid gas from the beginning of the kraeusen stage until such
time as it is transferred to kegs and bunged, substantially as
described." This claim covers the real invention of the process of the patentees, if it be their invention and be patentable as a process.
The Circuit Court, in its opinion, 20 Fed. Rep., 725, 733, held
that the most that could be claimed by the patentees was that
they applied the controllable pressure, created by the carbonic
acid gas in a state of fermentation, at an earlier stage than
was before known; that the essential parts of the apparatus
used were known before; that the same controllable pressure
had been applied at various stages of the manufacture; that
the application at one stage of the condition of the beer
instead of another would seem not to involve %nything more
than a mere mechanical change, which could be employed by

any one skilled in tha art; and that the claim of .the patent
for a particular process, irrespective of the mechanical devices,
claimed, (which the defendants had not used) 'could, nof be
sustained. But we think that in this view. the- court erred,
and that the third claim of the patent is a valid.claim. for the
process covered by it and described in the spedification. The
testimony is very full and clear that, as a process, it.Was not
known or used before in the art of.making ,beei ;-that it

and that it was recognized as a new and valuable- invefltion,

made known.
Professor Haines, the leading expert.1o6 tthe pla iiAf, says:
"The Meller and Hofmann system accodmplishes, in my
opinion, many results which had not before -been obtained,
and it acts, in doing so, in this way: Automatically regulated
pressure is applied to the casks during fhe- process of active
fermentation, and air is thereby, of coursei 6xcluded., Under
this increased pressure and the exclusion of air, fermentation
takes place more regularly, and the impurities in the beer
settle more rapidly. By the exclusion -o ,fho air, moreover,
fewer impurities are produced, for it is a..demonstrated fact
that, when oxygen is excluded from a fermenting mixture,
fewer yeast cells and other solids are generated. Not only is
there, therefore, produced less matter to subside, but by the
increased 'pressure these particles -are .rehder.ed.. specifically
heavier, and therefore settle much more rapidly;. 'The process,
therefore, if applied during the stage of active fermentation,
not only regulates the fermentation, but will materially hasten
the clarifying of the beer, both of which are objects not
6btained, so far as I know, by any previously used process or
apparatus."
The invention of the patentees covered by claim 3 is, as
stated before, applicable to the beer in the kraeusen stage in
the shavings casks. The shavings in these casks are thin strips
of white beech, hazel-nut, or other suitable wood, placed

FERAMENTATION CO. v. MAUS.
Opifion of the Court.

lengthwise of the cask, on its bottom, opposite the bung-bole,
and used as a fining medium. Being porous, they absorb the
turbid ingredients in the beer, and also mechanically arrest
them, when! pricipitated. -The kiaeusen beer which is added
to the contents of the shavings casks, to produce fermentation, is young beer, in full fermentation, the beer or wort to
which the kraeusen beer is added in the shavings casks being
itself comparatively flat and not clarified.
Vent-bungs of various descriptions existed before but were
used towards the last stage of the fermentation of the beer
in the kraeusen stage in the shavings casks, to confine mechanically the very last of the slowly generating gas, the valve or
vent in the bung operating to prevent over-pressure or "overbunging," in case there should be delay, in drawing off the
beer after it became ready fol market. -The effect of the
accumulation of the carbonic acid gas generated in the later
stages of the fermentation was and is to impart.more effervescence to the beer. The invention of the patentees is entirely independent of the old and well-known vent-bungs, and
of any prior apparatus for preventing over-bunging. It is
for the process of 5unging the cask simultaneously with the
commencement of the active fermentation of the beer in the
kraeusen stage. It utilizes the gas to clarify the beer, the
pressure of the gas causing the impurities quickly and permanently to deposit themselves on the bottom and sides of
the cask, instead of-being removed, as in the old method, by
overflowing and slow deposit. Professor Haines says: "The
novelty and characteristic feature of the lirocess, by which
its excellent results are produced, chiefly arises from its introducing an automatically acting process at an earlier stage of
the preparation of beer than has been practised by other devices. This earlier bunging produces a number of valuable
results, one of the most valuable of which is the rapid clarification of the beer. By placing the actively fermenting
liquid under adequate; automatically controlled pressure, and
keeping it thus under pressure until drawn off for use, the
beer ferments more equably, less sediment is produced, and
clarification is more rapid and more certain. It is, then, as I

Opinion of the Court.

understand it, not the mechanical application of pressure, but
the application of a suitable pressure, beginning with the
second active fermentation of the beer and continuing-to the
close, that constitutes the, most valuable and novel feature of
this process."
Dr. Ruschhaupt, another expert witness for the plaintiff,
says: "It is an acknowledged fact, that the influence of pressure upon a compressible object suspended in a liquid causes it
to sink, and also that pressure in closed vessels is propagated to
all sides with the same force. For this reason an ascending
or rising of the insoluble impurities cannot take place as long
as the pressure continues or increases; however, as soon as the
pressure is released or diminished, a rising must necessarily
result. With beer especially such rising easily occurs, and the
lighter impurities will almost at once be drawn into the beer
again. Any apparatus which does not allow the pressure to
become diminished at any time during the operation, and
which is not apt to get out of ozder or become clogged, like a
hydrostatic column, will avoid the drawbacks above referred
to, and -this object is beyond question fully accomplished by
the apparatus patented to Meller and Hofmann. It is not
simply a safety-valve or vent, but intended to accomplish
much more, and to be used, if necessary, in the height of the
kraeusen stage. But not in this respect lies the principal advantages of said patent. Its new mode of treatment is 'the
main thing. The patent recommends automatic bunging at
an earlier stage of manufacture than before practised, viz.,
during the kraeusen stage, and for an entirely different purpose, viz., to hasten the clarifying and settling of the beer.
The patent suggests in this respect a new and different mode
of treatment before the beer is clear and settled. The new
process is carried into effect by causing the liquid in the cask
to be placed under an even and equal pressure of carbonic acid
gas, which is uniformly applied and maintained throughout
the treatment, up to the very time of racking off the beer,
by means of an automatically working valve or weight, regulated at a prefixed" standard of about seven pounds to the
square inch." ,

FERMENTATION CO. v. MAUS.
Opinion of the Court.

The advantages of the process in practice are thus stated
by Mr. Seib, a brewer: "First, I save on a.thirty-barrel cask
about a barrel and a half of beer; secondly, my beer will not'
become overbunged; third, in the old mode of treating beer,
when the liquid was two to three weeks on shavings, it became a shavings taste, which is not the case under the Yeller
and Hofnann method. You may keep the beer two months
in the latter way. Fourth, it also involves material financial
advantages, in th'is: If the beer is not used at the pairticular
time, it needs not, as of old, be pumped over into other casks
to guard against the results of overbunging. There is another
most important advantage arising from this early proci.ss of
bunging. It prevents overflowage and the yeast souring the
floors and cellars, and, as the yeast is a plant and continues to
grow, the atmosphere becomes corrupted, which reacts on the
beer in the cellar."
Contemporary publications give to the patentees the credit
of ,this invention. In the "]Manual of Beer Brewing," published at Weimar, in 1877, by Prof. Ladislaus von Wagner,
at pages 728 and 729, Yeller's method of treatment, in using
carbonic acid gas to clarify beer, is spoken of as successful,
and as having been already introduced for four years and
spread over the whole European continent. In a treatise on:
beer brewing, published at Braunschweig, in 1877, by Dr. Carl
Lintner, the invention, as one .for putting the beer, when
drawn off into casks, immediately under the pressure of pure
carbonic acid gas, is ascribed to Yeller. In "The American
Beer Brewer," published at New York, in June, 1.978, by A.
Schwartz, the invention is spoken of as one *which the"writerhad seen in 1877 at the brewery of Mr. Hofmann, at Mainheim, in Germany, carried out by a bunging apparatus such
as is described in the patent.
Within the'rules laid down by this court in Corningv. Burden), 15 How. 252, 267, in Cochrane v. ])eener, 94 U. S. 780,
787, 788, and in Tilgkmanv. Proctor,102U. S. 707. 722, 724,

claim of the patent is patentable as a process, irrespective of
the apparatus or instrumencality for carrying it out. It is the

performing of a series of acts upon the beer in the kraeusen
stage, producing new and useful results in the art of making
marketable beer. The process consists 7not in merely -applying
an apparatus to the cask at some period of the kraeusen stage
of the beer, but consists in this, that when the beer has been
.put into the casks, and the kraeusen beer is added to it, and
the apparatus is applied at the beginning of the kraeusen
stagle, the beer will be kept under a controllable pressure of
carbonic acid gas until such time as it is fit to be transferred
to the kegs for market, such ,presstire resulting in the complete
and speedy clarification of the beer, although it is in a state
of active fermentation in, the closed shavings casks, with the
incidental results of no loss of beer, no fouling of the casks or
the .cellar, no alteration of the flavor of the beer, and no
danger to the health of the workmen. -This is, as was said in
Cochrane v. Deener, "a mode of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result," and "an act, or a series of
acts, performed upon the subject matter to be transformed
and reduced to a different state or thing," and "requires that
certain things should be done with certain substances, and in
a certain order." It is, therefore, a process or art. The apparatus for carrying out the process is of secondary consequence, and may itself be old, separately considered, without
invalidating the patent, if the process be new and produces a,
new result.
There appears also to be a new principle of action involved.
in the invention of the patentees. The carbonic acid gas generated by the fermentation in the cask, instead of being
allowed to continually ascend, as it does with an open bunghole, keeping the liquid constantly in a turbid state and overflowing at the bung-hole, is made, as stated in the specification,
to first accumulate in the space above the beer in the closed
cask, until the pressure is such that the gas overcomes, the
density, of the beer, and enters it again, and charges it up to
the pressu-e at which the water column is set, thus creating
an.-equilibrium between the rising bubbles of gas and, the
pressure above, so that gravity can act on the yeast and impurities, and carry them down so that they will remain with

the shavings at the bottom. This is a new use, in the treat-.
ment of fermenting beer, of the carbonic acid gas which it
generates, and a new method- or process of hastening the
clarifying and settling of the beer.
This being the proper construction of the third claim of the
patent, we are prepared to consider the question of the novelty
of the process covered by the claim, in the light in which it
has been explained.
The United States patent to George Wallace, No. 62,581,
granted ..March 5, 1867, does not exhibit any such process.
The apparatus shown in it acted on a directly opposite principle, and was designed to stir up the fermenting medium
and accelerate the fermentation and decomposition of mash..
Professor Haines says, in regard to it: "I have examined th6
Wallaoe patent, and compared it with the process and apparatus of ]Meller and Hofmann. In my opinion, the two are
radically different. The Wallace patent introduces to the
bottom - of one fermenting tank a pipe which is connected
with the upper portion of the other fermenting cask. Now,
if any excess of pressure should occur in either cask over what
there is in the other, a quantity of carbonic acid gas will be
forced to the very bottom of the cask having the smaller
pressure, and in this way the yeast and other sediment will
be thoroughly stirred up and diffused through the fermenting
liquid. This would unquestionably increase the rapidity of
fermentation, but it W6iild accomplish exactly the opposite
result of what the Mfeller and Hofmann proqess contemplatesnamely, the forcing down of the sediment, so as to clarify the
beer, and not its agitatioll and dissemination through the
fluid. It seems to me-therefore, that the Wallace apparatus
and prur.oss, as figured and described in patent 62,581, would
not and could not be used for the same 'purposes that the
Mfeller and Iofmann process is employed." Dr. Ruschhaupt
testifies to the same effect.
The United States patent No. 63,636, granted to Thomas
l.'Hicks, April 9, 1867, the United States patent No. 90,949,
granted to William Dietrichsen, May 25, 1869, and the United
States patent No. 115,950, granted to William Gilham, June

13, 1871; do not, any of them, disclose the process-of the
appellant, of controlling the action of beer in active fermentation in the kraeusen stage, for the purposes of clarification
and preparation for market, by means of the controllable
pressure of, carbonic acid gas. . The patent to Gilham is for
the production of sparkling wine, by charging the wine under
pressare with the carbonic acid gas generated by the wine
during the process of fermentation. It does not develop the
process of the appellant as applied to beer in the kraeusen
stage, nor does it disclose the fact that Gilham knew of the
existence of any such process.
The patent to Henry Schlaudeman, No. 204,687, of June
11, 1878, the patent to John M. Pfaudler, No. 205,572, of July
2, 1878, the patent to Theodore F. Straub, No. 208,711, of
October 8, 1878, and the patent to Frank Fehr, No. 215,596,
of Afa'y 20, 187 9, are later in date than the invention of Meller
and Hofmann, and all of them are subsequent in date to the
introduction into use of that invention in this country, in
July or August, 187'7.
The. experiments of Clement A. Maus were in September,
1871. The apparatus of Jacob W. Loeper was an automatic
vent-bung, but it is not shown to have been used in 6arrying
out any such process as that of the appellant. The apparatus
of Herman Sturm was manifestly only an experiment, abandoned 'and given up before the invention of Yeller and Hofmann was introduced. It is not satisfactorily shown to have
been used on shavings casks with the- beer in the. kraeusen
stage. Dr. Ruschhaupt testifies that the devices of Sturm,
all of them, belong to the class of automatic vent-bungs used
during the last stages of after-fermentation; that they were
not capable of being used during the kraeusen stage, in shavings casks, because they were constructed to act under a much
lower pressure than that spoken of in. the patent to Yeller
and Hofmann; that the one with the mercury gauge isintended to work under a pressure of only about one-pound to
the square inch, and the others were liable to get out of order
by the clogging and rusting of the springs; and that they
were only applied to let off the surplus carbonic acid gas from

lager beer casks to prevent their bursting. Professor Haines
testifies as follows in regard to the Strm apparatus: "In my

opinion, the forms of apparatus described and figured in the
testimony of General St urm could n6t be practically applied
for the purposes of the A[eller and Hofmann process, for the
bungs figured and described would certainly become clogged
by the foam that is sent upward in considerable quantity
during the active fermentation, and, becoming clogged, would
either cease to act or else remain permanently open. The
other device figured and described contemplates, according to
the description, the application of a very trivial pressure,
stated by the witness himself as equivalent to about a pound
per square inch. As I before testified, I believe such a trivial
pressure would not bring about the effects obtained by the
Meller and Hofnann process, although it would be sufficient to
charge the beer with a certain amount of gas and prevent
the casks from bursting, which, as I understand it, was the
object of the apparatus now spoken of.

It ls difficult

to determine, from the testimony of the witness, exactly at
what stage of the brewing of the beer the apparatuses were
employed; but as he states that they. were made in 1860, at
which time the treating of beer with kraeusen in shavings
casks was not practised, it is evident that the apparatuses
were not intended to be applied during this stage of brewing."
It is testified that the appellant's process of treating beer
under the automatically controllable pressure of carbonic acid
gas is of great value in the brewing business, and has come
into general use and been put up in about eighty breweries,
many of which are among the largest in the United States.
There is no doubt whatever that the defendants have used
the process covered by the third claim of the patent. One of
the defendants, Frank A. Mlaus, testifies that, in the fall of
1878 or the spring of 1879, the defendants. commenced using
an apparatus which applies the controllable pressure of carbonic acid gas to the beer in the kraeusen stage; that, as soon
as the finmgs are added to the beer in the shavings casks, they
attach the apparatus; that sometimes, however, it is not attached until a day or two after the kracusen and finings are

added; that they keep it attached from eight to twenty days,
until the beer is drawn off for the market; that, on an average,
they gain about two days by the use of the apparatus; and that
they avoid the running over of the foaming yeast through the
bung-hole.
We have confined our consideration of this case to the third
claim of the patent, as that is the one which distinctly embodies the invention of the patentees, and it has been infringed
by the defendants. -It will be time enough to consider the
other process claims, and the eighth claim, in cases involving
their infringement, where the third claim is not also infringed.
In the present case, it appears that the defendants have used
"th e process of preparing ana preserving beer foi the market,"
by "holding it under controllable pressure of carbonic acid
gas from the beginning of the kraeusen stage until such time
as it is transferred to kegs and bunged, substantially as described" in the specification of the patent.
The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the case is
remanded to that court, with a direction to enter a decree
establishingthe validity of the third claim of the patent,
and awarding a peipetual injunction ald an account of
proit and damages, and to takesuchfurther proceedings
i7&the suit as may not be -inconsistentwith this opinion.
