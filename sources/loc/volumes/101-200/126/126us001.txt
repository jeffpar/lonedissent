OVERLAND TELEPHONE COMPANY v. AMERICAN
BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
It appears from the proof in these causes that Alexander Graham Bell was
the first discoverer of the art or process of transferring to, or impressing upon, a continuous current of electricity in a closed circuit, by gradually changing its intensity, the vibrations of air produced by the human
voice in articulate speech, in a way to cause the speech to be carried to
and received by a listener at a distance on the line of the current; and
this discovery was patentable under the patent laws of the United States.
In order to procure a patent for a process the inventor must describe his
invention with sufficient clearness and precision to enable those skilled
in the matter to understand what his process is, and must point out some
practicable way of putting it into operation; but he is not required to
bring the art to the highest degree of perfection.
Bell's fifth claim under his patent of March 7, 1876, No. 174,465, is not
confined to the magneto instrument, or to such modes of creating electrical undulations as could be produced by that form of apparatus.
Bell's fifth'claim under his patent of March 7, 1876, also covered his invention of an apparatus to make useful his discovery of an art or process
for electrical transmission of speech, and this invention was patentable
under the laws of the United States.
The discovery and invention patented to Bell by his patent of March 7, 1876,
were not described in the publication made by Charles Bourseul in Paris
in 1854, nor in the publication in Germany in 1861-63 respecting the
experiments and inventions of Philipp Reis, nor in the publication in
Germany in 1862 of what are known as the Reis-Legat experiments; and
they were not anticipated by the experiments of Dr. Van der Weyde in
New York in 1869, nor by the invention of J.W. McDonough of Chicago
in 1876, nor by the invention patented in the United States to C. F. Varley
of London, June 2, 1868, nor by the invention patented to said Varley in
England, October8, 1870.
For reasons stated in its opinion the court holds that the alleged invention
of the telephone by Daniel Drawbaugh prior to Bell's discovery and
invention patented to him March 7, 1876, is not made out.
For reasons stated in its opinion the court holds that the charge of a fraud-

Statement of the Case.
ulent interpolation in Bell's specification after the filing of it in the
Patent Office, between February 11 and February 19, 1876, is not sustained; and that not a shadow of suspicion can rest on any one, growing
out of the misprint of the specification in the Dowd case.
The authority conferred by the special act of Massachusetts "!to incorporate
the American Bell Telephone Company," authorized the corporation organized under ยง 3, Mass. Stat. 1870, c. 224, to select its corporate name,
and made the statutory certificate provided for by ยง 11 of that act conclusive proof of its corporate existence.
Section 4887 of the Revised Sta'tutes does not invalidate an American patent
which bears a different date from that of a foreign patent for the same
invention, but only limits its term to the term of the foreign patent.
Letters patent No. 186,787, dated January 30, 1877, granted to Alexander
Graham Bell for an improvement in electric telephony, is a valid patent,
and the fifth claim under it was not anticipated by the magnet described
by Schellen.

IN EQurry. The bills were filed in Circuit Courts of the
United States by the American Bell Telephone Company and
others, as owners of two patents, known as the Bell-telephone
Patents, to enjoin the several defendants against infringements
of those patents.
The two patents thus alleged to have come into the ownership of the complainants and to have been infringed were:
1. No. 174,465, dated March 7,1876, granted 'to Alexander
Graham Bell for new and useful improvements in telegraphy;
and,
2. No. 186,787, dated January 30, 1877, granted to the
same inventor for new and useful improvements in electric
teleph6ny.

IN TELEGRAPHY.

"Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. 174;465, dated March 7;
1876; application filed Februar- 14, 1876.

"To all whom it may concern :

"Be it known that I,

ALExAwDER GRAHAx BELL

of Salem,,

Massachusetts, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Telegraphy, of which the following is a specification:
"In Letters Patent granted to me April 6, 1875, No. 161,739, I have described a method of, and'apparatus for, transmitting two or more telegraphic signals simultaneously along
a single wire by the employment of transmitting instruments,
each of which occasions a'succession of electrical impulses differingin rate from the others; and of receiving instruments,
each tuned to a pitch at -which it will be put in vibratioht to
roduce its fundamental note by one only of the transmitting
instruments; and of vibratory circuit-breakers -operating to
convert the vibratory movement of the receiving instrument
into a permanent make or break (as the case may be) of a
local circuit, in which is placed a Morse sounder, register, or
other telegraphic apparatus. I have also therein described a
form of autograph-telegraph based upon the action of the
above-mentioned instruments.
"In illustration of my method of multiple telegraphy I have
shown in the patent aforesaid, as one form of transmitting
instrument, an electro-magnet having a steel-spring armature,
which is kept in vibration by the action of a local battery.
This armature in vibrating makes and breaks the main circuit,
producing an intermittent current upon the line-wire. I have
found, however, that upon this plan the limit to the number
of signals that can be sent simultaneously over the same wireis very speedily reached; for, when a number of transmitting
instruments, having different rates of vibration, are simultane-

Statement of the Case.

ously making and breaking the same circuit, the effect upon
the main line is practically equivalent to one colitinuous
current.
"In a pending application for Letters Patent, filed in the
United States Patent Office February 25, 1875, I have described two ways of producing the intermittent current -the
one by actual make and break of contact, the other by alternately increasing and diminishing the intensity of the current
without actually breaking the circuit. The current produced
by the latter method I shall term, for distinction sake, a ' pulsatory current.'
"My present invention consists in the employment of a
vibratory or undulatory current of electricity in contradistinction to a merely intermittent or pulsatory current, and of
a method of, and apparatus for, producing electrical undulations upon the line-wire.
"1The distinction between an undulatory and a pulsatory
current will be understood by considering that electrical pulsations are caused by sudden or instantaneous changes of intensity, and that electrical undulations result from gradual
changes of intensity exactly analogous to -the changes in the
density of air occasioned by simple pendulous vibrations. The
electrical movement, like the aerial motion, can be represented by a sinusoidal curve or by the resultant of several sinusoidal curves.
" Intermittent or pulsatory and undulatory currents may be
of two kinds, accordingly as the successive impulses have all
the same polarity or are alternately positive and negative.
"The advantages I claim to derive from the use of an undulatory current in place of a merely intermittent one are, first, that
a very much larger number of signals can be transmitted simultaneously on the same circuit; second, that a closed circuit
and single main battery may be used; third, that communication in both directions is established without the necessity of
special induction-coils; fourth, that cable despatches may be
transmitted more rapidly than by means of an intermittent
current or by the methods at present in use; for, as it is unnecessary to discharge the cable before a new signal can be made,

the lagging of cable-signals is prevented; fifth, and that as
the circuit is never broken a spark-arrester becomes unnecessary.
1"It has long been known that when a permanent magnet is
caused to approach the pole of an electro-magnet a current of
electricity is induced in the coils of the latter, and that when
it is made to recede a current of opposite polarity to the first
appears upon the wire. When, therefore, a permanent magnet
is caused to vibrate in front of the pole of an electro-magnet
an undulatory current of electricity is induced in the coils
of the electro-magnet, the undulations of which correspond, in
rapidity of succession, to the vibrations of the magnet, in
polarity to the direction of its motion, and in intensity to the
amplitude of its vibration.
"That the difference between an uhdulatory and an intermittent current may be more clearly understood I shall
describe the condition of the electrical current when the
attempt is-made to transmit two musical notes simultaneously
-first upon the one plan and then upon the other. Let the
interval between the two sounds be a major third; then their
rates of vibration are in the ratio of 4 to 5. Now, when the
intermittent current is used the circuit is made and broken
four times by one transmitting instrument in the same time
that five makes and breaks are caused by the other. A and B,
Figs. 1, 2, and 3, represent the intermittent currents produced,
four impulses of B being made in the same time as five impulses of A. e c c,&c., show where and for how long time the
circuit is made, and d d d, &c., indicate the duration of the
breaks of the circuit. The line A and B shows the total effect
upon the current when the transmitting instruments for A and
B are caused simultaneously to make and break the same circuit. The resultant effect depends very much upon the duration of the make relatively to the break. In Fig. I the ratio
is as I to 4; in Fig. 2, as I to 2; and in Fig. 3 the makes and
breaks are of equal duration. The combined effect, A and B,
Fig. 3, is very nearly equivalent to a continuous current.
"When many transmitting instruments of different rates of
vibration are simultaheously making and breaking the same

Statement of the Case.

circuit the current upon the main line becomes for all practical
purposes continuous.
1KNext, consider the effect when an undulatory current is
employed. Electrical undulations, induced by the vibration of
a body capable of inductive action, can be represented graph!cally, without error, by the same sinusoidal curve which expresses the vibration of the inducing body itself, and the effect
of its vibration upon the air; for, as above stated, the rate of
oscillation in the electrical current corresponds to the rate of
vibration of the including body -that is, to the pitch of the
sound produced. The intensity of the current varies with the
amplitude of the vibration - that is, with the loudness of the
sound; and the polarity of the current corresponds to the
direction of the vibrating body -that is, to the condensations
and rarefactions of air produced by the vibration. Hence, the
sinusoidal curve A or B, Fig. 4, represents, graphically, the'
electrical undulations induced in a circuit by the vibration of
a body capable of inductive action.
The horizontal line a d ef, &c., represents the zero of current.
The elevations b b b, &c., indicate impulses of -positive electricity. The depressions ccc, &c., show impulses of negative
electricity. The vertical distance bd or ef of any portion of
the curve from the zero-line expresses the intensity of the
positive or negative impulse at the part observed, and the
horizontal distance a a indicates the duration of the electrical
oscillation. The vibrations represented by the sinusoidal
curves B and A, Fig. 4, are in the ratio aforesaid, of 4 to 5 that is, four oscillation's of 3 are made in the same time as five
oscillations of A.
"The combined effect of A and B, when induced simultaneously on the same circuit, is expressed by the curve A + B,
Fig. 4, which is the algebraical sum of the sinusoidal curves
A and B. This curve A + B also indicates the actual motion
of the air when the two musical notes considered are sounded
simultaneously. Thus, when electrical undulations of different
rates are simultaneously induced in the same circuit, an effect
is produced exactly analogous to that occasioned in the air by
the vibration of the inducing bodies. Hence, the co-existence

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Statement of the Case.

upon a telegraphic circuit of electrical vibrations of different
pitch- is rianifested, not by the obliterition of the vibratory
character of the current, but by peculiarities in the shapes of
,the electrical undulations, or, in other words, by peculiarities
in the shapes of the curves which represent those undulations.
"There are many ways of producing undulatory currents of
electricity, dependent for effect upon the vibrations or motions
of bodies capable of inductive action. A few of the methods
that may be employed I shall here specify. When a wire
through which a continuous current of electricity, is passing
is caused to vibrate in the neighborhood of another wire, an
undulatory current of electricity is induced in the latter.
When a cylinder, upon which are arranged bar-magnets is
made to rotate in front of the pole of an electro-magnet, an
undulatory current of electricity is induced in the coils of the
electro-magnet.
"1Undulations are caused in a continuous voltaic current by
the vibration or motion of bodies capable of inductive action,
or by the vibration of th6 conducting-wire itself in the neighborhood of such bodieA. Electrical undulations may also be
caused by alternately increasing and diminishing the resistance
of the circuit, or by alternately increasing and diminishing the
power of the battery. The internal resistance of a battery is
diminished by bringing the voltaic elements nearer together,
and increased by placing them farther apart. The reciprocal
vibration of the elements of a battery, therefore, occasions an
undulatory action in the voltaic current. The external resistanca may also be varied. For instance let mercury or some
other liquid form part of a voltaic circuit, then the more
*deeply the conducting-wire is immersed in the mercury or other
liquid the less resistance, does the liquid offer to the passage
of the current. Hence, the vibration of the conducting-wire
in mercury or other liquid included in the circuit occasions
undulations in the current. The vertical vibrations of the
elements of a battery in the liquid in which they are immersed
produces an undulatory action in the current by alternately
increasing and diminishing the power of the battery.
"In illustration of the method of creating electrical undula-

Statement of the Case.

tions, I shall sho* and describe one form of apparatus for producing the effect. I prefer to employ for this purpose an
electro-magnet, A, Fig. 5,having a coil upon only One of its
legs b. A steel-spring armature, c,is firmly clamped by one
extremity to the uncovered leg d of the magnet, and its free
end is allowed to project above the pole of the covered leg.,
The armature c can be set in vibration in a variety of ways,
one of which is by wind, and, in vibrating, it produces a musical note of a certain definite pitch.
"When the instrument A is placed in a voltaic circuit, g b e
fg, the armature c becomes magnetic, and the polarity of its
free end is opposed to that of the magnet underneath. So
long as the armature o remains -at rest, no effect is produced
upon the voltaic current, but the moment it is set in vibration
to produce its musical note a powerful inductive action takes
place, and electrical undulations traverse the circuit g b efg.
The vibratory current passing through the coil of the electromagnet f causes vibration in its armature A when the armature o h of the two instruments A I are normally in unison
with one another; but the armature A is unaffected by the
passage of the undulatory current when the pitches of the two
instruments are different.
"1Anumber of instruments may be placed upon a telegraphic
circuit, as in Fig. 6. When the armature of any one of, the
instruments is set in vibration All the other instruments upon
the circuit which are in unison with it respond, but those
which have normally a different rate of vibration remain silent.
Thus, if A, Fig. 6, is set in vibration, the armatures of A- and
A2 will vibrate also, but all the others on the circuit will remain
still. So if B 1 is caused to emit its musical note the instruments B B' respond. They continue sounding so long as the
mechanical vibration of BI is continued, but become silent with
the cessation of its motion. The duration of the sound may
be used to indicate the dot or dash of the Morse alphabet, and
thus a telegraphic despatch may be indicated by alternately
interrupting and renewing the sound. When two or more
instruments of different pitch are simultaneously caused to
vibrate, all the instruments of corresponding pitches upon the

Statement of the Case.

circuit are set in vibration, each responding to that. one only
of the transmitting instruments with which it is in unison.
Thus the signals of A, Fig. 6, are repeated by A' and A, bat
by no other instrument upon the circuit; the signals of B 2 by
B and B 1 ; and the signals of C1 by C and C2- whether A, B2,
and C' are successively or simultaneously caused to vibrate.
Hence by these instruments two or more telegraphic signals or
-messages may be sent simultaneously over the same circuit
without interfering with one another.
"I desire here to remark that there are many other uses to
which these instruments may be put, such as the simultaneous
transmission of musical notes, differing in loudness as well as
in pitch, and the telegraphic transmission of noises or sounds
of any kind.
"When the armature c, Fig. 5, is set in vibration the armature h responds not only in pitch but in loudness. Thus, when
o vibrates with little amplitude, a very soft musical note proceeds from h; and when c vibrates forcibly the amplitude of
the vibration of A is considerably increased, and the resulting
sound becomes louder. So, if A and B, Fig. 6, are sounded
simultaneously, (A loudly and B softly,) the instruments A'
and A repeat loudly the signals of A, and B 1 B 2 repeat softly
those of B.
"One of the ways in which the armature c, Fig. 5, may be
set in vibration has been stated above to be by wind. Another
mode is shown in Fig. ', whereby motion can be imparted to
the armature by the human voice or by means of a musical
instrument.

other extremity is attached to the centre of a stretched membrane, a. A cone, A, is used to converge sound-vibrations

membrane a is -set in vibration, the armature c is forced to
partake of the m6tion, and thus electrical undulations are
created upon the circuit E b efg. These undulations are similar in form to the air vibrations caused by the sound - that is,

its armature A to copy the motion of the armature 0. A similar sound to that uttered into A is then heard to proceed
from L.
"In this specification the three words 'oscillation,' vibration,' and 'undulation,' are used synonymously, and in contradistinction to the terms ' intermittent ' and ' pulsatory.' By the
teim 'body capable of inductive action,' I mean a body which,
when in motion, produces dynamical electricity. I include in
the category of bodies capable of inductive action brass,
copper, and other metals, as well as iron and steel.
"Having described my invention, what I claim, and desire.
to secure by Letters Patent, is as follows:
"1. A system of telegraphy in which the receiver is set in
vibration by the employment of undulatory currents of electricity, substantially as set forth.
"2. The combination, substantially as set forth, of. a permanent magnet or other body capable of inductive action, with
a closed circuit, so that the vibration of the one shall occasion
electrical undulations in the other, or in itself, and this I claim
whether the permanent magnet be set in vibration in the
neighborhood of the conducting-wire forming the circuit, or
whether the conducting-wire be set in vibration in the neighborhood of the permanent magnet, or whether the conductingwire and the permanent magnet both simultaneously be set in
vibration in each other's neighborhood.
"3. The method of producing undulations in a continuous
voltaic current by the vibration or motion of bodies capable of
inductive action, or by the vibration or motion of the conducting-wire itself, in.the neighborhood of such bodies, as set
forth.
"4. The method of producing undulations in a continuous
voltaic circuit by gradually increasing and diminishing the
resistance of the circuit, or by gradually increasing and diminishing the power of the battery, as set forth.
"5. The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal
or other sounds telegraphically, as herein described, by causing
electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the

"In Letters Patent granted to me the 6th day of April,
1875, No. 161,739, and in an application for Letters Patent of
the United States now pending, I have described a method of
and apparatus for producing musical tones by the action of a
rapidly interrupted electrical current, whereby a number of
telegraphic signals can be sent simultaneously along a single
circuit.
"In another application for Letters Patent now pending in
the United States Patent Office I have described a method of

directions, and a single battery be used for the whole circuit.

are transmitted simultaneously along a single wire by the employment of transmitting-instruments, each of which occasions
a succession of electrical impulses differing in rate from the
others, and are received without confusion by means of receiv-

ing-instruments, each tuned to a pitch at which it will be put
in vibration to produce its fundamental note by one only of
the transmitting-instruments. A separate instrument is therefore employed for every pitch, each instrument, being capable
of transmitting or receiving but a single note, and thus as
many separate instruments are required as there are messages
or musical notes to be transmitted.
"My invention has for its object, first, the transmission
simultaneously of two or more musical notes- or -telegraphic
signals along a single wire in either or both directions, and
with a single battery for the whole circuit, without the use of
as many instruments as there are musical notes or telegraphic
signals to be transmitted; second, the electrical transmission
by tiWe same means of articulate speech and sound of every
kind, whether musical or not; third, the elect~ioal transmission of musical tones, articulate speech, or sounds of every
kind, without the necessity of using a voltaic battery.
"In my Patent. No. 174,465, dated March 7,- 1876, I have
shown as one form of transmitting-instrument a stretched
membrane to which the armature of an electro-magnet is attached, whereby motion can be imparted to the armature by
the human voice, or by means of a musical instrument, or by
sounds produced in any way.
"In accordance with my present invention I substitute for
the membrane and armature shown in the transmitting and
receiving instruments alluded to above a plate of iron or steel
capable of being' thrown into vibration by sounds made in its
neighborhood.
"The nature of my invention and the manner in which the
same is or may be carried into effect will be understood by
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which "Figure I is a perspective view of one form of my electric
telephone. Fig. 2 is a vertical section of the same, and Fig. 3
is a plan view of the apparatus. Fig. 4 is a diagram illustratl

portions of the apparatus.

E represents a speaking-tube, by which sounds may be conveyed to or from the plate A. F is a bar of soft iron. G is a
coil of insulated copper wire, placed around the extremity of
the end H of the bar F. I is an adjusting-screw, whereby the
distance of the end HI from the plate A may be regulated.
"The electric telephones J, K, L; and M are placed at different stations upon a line, and are arranged upon circuit with
a battery, N, as shown in diagram, Fig. 4.
"I have shown the apparatus in one of its simplest forms, it
being well understood that the same may be varied in arrangement, combination, general construction, and form, as well as
material of which the several parts are composed.
"The operation and use of this instrument are as follows:
"I would premise by saying that this instrument is and may
is to
be used both as a transmitter and as a receiver -that
every
in
say, the sender of the message will use an instrument
particular identical in construction and operation with that
employed by the receiver, so that the same instrument can be
used alternately as a receiver and a transmitter.
"In order to transmit a telegraphic message by means of
these instruments, it is only necessary for the operator at a
telephone (say J) to make a musical sound in any way in the
neighborhood of the plate A -for convenience of operation,
through the spealdng-tube E- and to let the duration of the
sound signify the dot or dash of the Morse alphabet, and for
the operator who receives his message (say at M) tP listen to
his telephone, preferably through the speaking-tube E. When
two or more musical signals are being transmitted over the
same circuit all the telephones reproduce the signals for all the
messages; but as the signals for each message differ in pitch
from those for the other messages, it is easy for an operator
to fix his attention upon one message and ignore the other.
"When "a large number of despatches are being simultaneously transmitted it will be advisable for the operator to
listen to his telephone through a resonator, which will reenforce to his'ear the signals which he desires to observe. In
this way he is enabled to direct his attention to the signals for

musical signals, if preferred, can be automatically
received by means of a resonator, one end of which is closed
by a membrane, which vibrates only when the note with
which the resonator is in unison is emitted by the receivingtelephone. The vibrations of the membrane may be made to
operate a circuit-breaker, which will actuate a Morse sounder
or a telegraphic recording or registering apparatus.
"One form of vibratory circuit-breaker which may be used
for this purpose I have described in Letters Patent No. I'[&,399, June 6, 1876. Hence by this plan the simultaneous
tran'smission of a number of telegraphic messages over a
single circuit in the same or in both directions with a single
main battery for the whole circuit and a single telephone at
each station is rendered Practicable. This is of great advantage in this, that for the conveyance of several messages, or
signals, or sounds over a single wiri simultaneously, it is no
longer necessary to have separate instruments correspondingly
tuned for each given sound, which plan requires nice adjustment of the corresponding instruments, while the present
improvement admits of a single instrument at each station, or,
if for convenience several are employed, they all are alike in
construction, and need not be adjusted or tuned to particular
pitches.
"Whatever sound is made in the neighborhood of any telephone- say at J, Fig. 4 -'is echoed in fac-simile by the telephones of all the other stations upon the circuit; hence this
plan is also adapted for the use of the transmitting intelligibly
the exact sounds of articulate speech. To cpnvey an articulate
message it is only necessary for an operator to speak in the
neighborhood of his telephone, preferably through the tube E,
and for another operator at a distant station upon the same
circuit to listen to the telephone at that station. If two persons speak simultaneously in the neighborhood of the same or
different telephones, the utterances of the two speakers are
reproduced simultaneously by all the other telephones on the

Statement of the Case.

same circuit; hence by this plan a number of vocal messages
may be transmitted simultaneously on the same circuit, in
either or both directions. All the effects noted above may be
produced by the same instruments without a battery by rendering the central bar F H permanently magnetic. Another
form of telephone, for use without a battery, is shown in Fig.
5, in which 0 is a compound permanent, magnet, to the poles
of which are affixed poll-pieces of soft iron, P Q, surrounded
by helices of insulated wire, R S.
"Fig. 6 illustrates the arrangement upon circuits of similar
instruments to that shown in Fig. 5.
"In lieu of the plate A in above figures, iron or steel reeds
of definite pitch may be placed in front of the electro-magnet
0, and,- in connection with a series of such instruments of
different pitches, an arrangement upon circuit may be employed similar to that shown in my. Patent No. 174,465, and
illustrated in Fig. 6 of Sheet 2 in said patent. The battery,
of course, may be omitted.
"This invention is not limited to the use of iron or steel,
but includes within its scope any material capable of inductive
action.
"The essential feature of the invention consists in the armature of the receiving-instrument being vibrated by the varying
attraction of the electro-magnet so as to vibrate the air in the
vicinity thereof in the same manner as the air is vibrated at
the other end by the production of the sound. It is, therefore, by no means necessary or essential that the traunsmittinginstrument should be of the same construction as the receivinginstrument. Any instrument receiving and transmitting the
impression of agitated air may be used as the transmitter,
although, for convenience and for reciprocal communication,
I prefer to use like instruments at either end of an electrical
wire. I have heretofore described and exhibited such other
means of transmitting sound, as will be seen by reference to
the proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Volume XII.
"For conVenience, I prefer to apply to each instrument a
call-bell. This may be arranged so as to ring, first, when the

main circuit is 'opened; second, when the bar F comes into
contact with the plate A. The. first is done to call attention;
the second indicates -when it is necessary to readjust the magnet, for it is important that the distance of the magnet from
the plate should be as little as possible, without, however,
being in contact. I have also found that the electrical undulations produced upon the main line by the vibration of the plate
A are intensified by placing the coil G at the end of the bar F
nearest the plate A, and not extend it beyond the middle, or
thereabout.

Having thus described my invention, what I claim, and
desire to secure by Letters Patent, is
"1. The union upon and by means of an electric circuit of
two or more instruments, constructed for operation substantially as herein shown and described, so that if motion of any
kind or form be produced in any way in the armature of any
one of the said instruments, the armatures of all the. other instruments upon the same circuit will be moved in like manner
and form, and if such motion be produced in the former by
sound, like sound will be produced by the motion of the latter.
"2. In a system of electric telegraphy or telephony, consisting of transmitting and receiving instruments united upon an
electric circuit, the production, in the armature of each receiving-instrument, of any given motion by subjecting said armature to an attraction varying in intensity, however such variation may be produced in the magnet; and hence I claim the
production of any given sound or sounds from the armature of
the receiving-instrument by subjecting said armature to an
attraction varying in intensity, in such manner as to throw
the armature into that form of vibration that characterizes
the given sound or sounds.
"3. The combination, with an electro-magnet, of a plate of
iron or steel, or other material capable of inductive action,
which can be thrown into vibration by the movement of surrounding air or by the attraction of a magnet"4. In combination with a plate and electro niaguet, as
before claimed, the means herein described, or their mechanical equivalents, of adjusting the relative position of the two

so that, without touching, they may be set aยง closely together
as possible.
"5. The formation, in an electric telephone -uch as herein
shown and described, of a magnet with a coil upon the end or
ends of the magnet nearest the plate.
"6. The combination, with an electric telephone such as
described, of a sounding-box, substantially as herein shown
and set forth.
"'7. In combination with an electric telephone, as herein
described, the employment of a speaking or hearing tube for
conveying sounds to or from the telephone, substantially as

The complainants alleged infringement of claim five of the
first patent by all the defendants below, and infringement of
claims three, five, six, seven and eight of the second patent, or
of some of them, by some of the defendants below.
The respondents all contested the validity of both of Bell's
patents. They also contested the scope of claim five of the
first patent. The question of infringement turned upon the
scope of this claim, as none of the defendants used instruments
which were indentical with the forms shown in the drawings
of that patent. Dolbear's instrument differed from those of
the other appellants, and his contention as to the scope of this
claim varied from that of the others, as will appear more fully
in the report of the arguments infra.

not patentable.

name of electro-magnet, can thus in turn attract and then
release a movable plate (plaque qnobile) which by its to-and-fro
movement produces the conventional signals employed in telegraphy. Sometimes this movement is directly utilized, and is
made to produce dots or dashes on a strip of paper which is
drawn along by clockwork. The conventional signals are thus
formed by a combination of those dots and dashes. This is the
American telegraph, which bears the name of More, its inventor. Sometimes this to-and-fro movement is converted into a
movement of rotation. In that way we have either the dial
telegraph used on railroads, or the telegraph used in the government system, which by means of two line-wires and two
indicating needles, reproduce all the sign4ls of the aerial telegraph or senaplhore which was formerly used. Suppose, now,
that we arrange upon a movable horizontal circle letters, figures, signs of punctuation, &c. One can understand that the
principle we have stated can be used to choose at a distance
such and such a character, and to determine its movement,
and consequently to print it on a sheet of paper appropriately
placed for this purpose. This is the printing telegraph.
"We have gone still further. By the employment of the
same principle, and by means of a mechanism rather complicated, it has been possible to reach a result which at first
would seem to be almost a miracle. Handwriting itself is produced at a distance, and not only handwriting, but any line o.any curve; so that, being in Paris, you can draw a profile by
ordinary means there, and the same profile draws itself at the
same time at Frankfort. Attempts of this sort have succeeded.
The apparatug has been exhibited at 'the London Exhibition.
Some details, however, remain to be perfected. It would seem
impossible to go beyond this in the region of the marvellous.
Let us try, nevertheless, to go a few steps further. I have
asked myself, for example, if the spoken word itself could not
be transmitted by electricity; in a word, if what was spoken
in Vienna may not be heard in Paris ? The thing is practicable in this way:
"We know that sounds are made by vibrations, and are
made sensible to the ear by the same vibrations, which are

reproduced by the intervening medium. But the intensity of
the vibrations diminishes very rapidly with the distance; so
that even with the aid of speaking tubes and trumpets, it is
impossible to exceed somewhat narrow limits. Suppose that a
man speaks near a movable disk, sufficiently flexible to lose
none of the vibrations of the voice; that this disk alternately
makes and breaks the connection with a battery: you may
have at a distance another disk which will simultaneously execute the same vibrations.
"It is true that the intensity of the sounds produced will be
variable at the point of departure, at which the disk vibrates
by means of the voice, and constant at the point of arrival,
where it vibrates by means of electricity; but it has been
shown that this does not ehange the sounds. It is, moreover,
evident that the sounds will be reproduced at the same pitch.
"The present state of acoustic science does not permit us to
declare aprioriif this will be precisely the case with syllables
uttered by the human voice. The mode in which these syllables are produced has not yet been sufficiently investigated.
It is true that we know that some are uttered by the teeth,
others by the lips, &c.; but that is all.
"lHowever this may be, observe that the syllables can only
reproduce upon the sense of hearing the vibrations of the intervening medium. Reproduce precisely these vibrations, and
you will reproduce precisely these syllables.
"It is, at all-events, impossible, in the present condition of
science, to prove the impossibility of transmitting sound by
electricity. Everything tends to show, on the contrary, that
there is such a possibility. When the application of electromagnetism to the transmission of messages was first discussed,
a man of great scientific attainments treated the idea as Uto-pian, and yet there is now direct communication between London and Vienna by means of a simple wire. Men declared it
to be impossible, but it is done.
"It need not be said that numerous applications of the
highest importance will immediately arise from the transmission of speech .by electricity. Any one who is not deaf

require no apparatus except an electric battery, two vibrating
disks and a wire. In many cases, as, for example, in largeestablishments, orders might be transmitted in this way,
although transmission in this way will not be used while it
is necessary to transmit letter by letter, and to make use of
telegraphs which require use and apprenticeship. However
this may be, it is certain that in a more or less distant future,
speech will be transmitted by electricity. I have made some
experiments in this direction. They are delicate, and demand
time and patience; but the approximations obtained promise
a favorable result.

however, produce any result at all satisfactory, because the
vibrations of sound-conducting media soon lose their intensity
to such an extent that they are no longer appreciable by our
senses.
"A reproduction of tones [Ti5nen] at certain distances by
means of a galvanic current has probably been thought of,
but the practical solution of this problem has certainly seemed
the most doubtful to the very persons who, from their knowledge and appliances, were in the best condition to attack it.
To a person having only a superficial knowledge of physics,
the problem presents far less difficulties, simply because the
most of them axe unperceived. About nineyears ago I also
(having an extraordinary enthusiasm for what was new, and
an insufficient knowledge of physics) had the boldness to
attempt the solution, but was soon forced to desist, because
the very first experiment convinced me of the impossibility of
its solution.
"Later, after further study and experience, I came to see
that my first experiment had been a very rough and by no
means conclusive one; I did not, however, follow up the
subject seriously, because I did not feel myself equal to the
difficulties in the way.
"Youthful impressions, however, are strong, and therefore
not easily effaced. I could never get rid of the thought of
that first experiment and its occasion, notwithstanding all that
reason says to the contrary, and thus, half unwillingly, this
project of my youth was reviewed in hours of leisure; the
difficulties and the means for overcoming them were weighed;
but for the present, at least, no experiment was made.
"How indeed could a single instrument reproduce the combined effect of all the organs occupied in human speech? This
was always the cardinal question; finally I got the notion of
putting the question in another way:
"How is our ear affected by the totality of vibrations produced by the organs of speech all simultaneously active? Or
more generally;
"How are we affected by the vibrations of several simultaneously sounding budies?

TELEPHONE CASES.
Statement of the Case.

"To answer this question, we must, in the first place, understand what must happen in order that we may perceive a
single tone.
"Without our ear, anuy tone is nothing else than a recurrent
condensation and rarefaction of some body repeated at least
seven or eight times in a second. If this occurs in the same
medium in which we are, the membrane of the ear is at each
condensation forced towards the middle ear, to be moved at
the subsequent rarefaction in the opposite direction. These
vibrations produce a synchronous raising and falling of the
hammer upon the anvil (according to other authorities, an
approach or receding of the ear-bone particles), and a similar
number of tremors in the fluid of the cochlea, in which the
filaments of the auditory nerve are distributed. The greater
the condensatibn of the sound-conducting medium at any
given moment, the greater is the amplitude of vibration of
the membrane and hammer, and consequently the more powerful the blow upon the anvil, and the vibration of the nerves
by means of the fluid.
"The office of our organs of hearing is, therefore, to transmit with certainty up to the auditory nerve every condensation and rarefaction occurring in the surrounding medium.
But the office of the auditory nerve is to bring to our consciousness the vibrations of matter which have occurred in a
given time, both -as regards number and amplitude. Here,
for the first time, certain combinations receive a name; here,
certain vibrations are t6nes or noises [Thne oder Hi.stfne].
"What our auditory nerve perceives is, then, simply the
effect of a force coming within the range of consciousness, and
this force can be represented both as to duration and magnitude graphically by a curve.

"Let a& represent any given time, and the curve above the
line condensation (+), the curve below the line rarefaction
(-), then any ordinate raised from the end of any abscissa will

represent the degree of condensation, at the -time represented
by its base, in consequence of which the drum of the ear
vibrates.
"Our ear can under no circumstances appreciate more than
can be represented by these curves, and this indeed is entirely
sufficient to give us. a clear perception of any tone [Ton] or
any combination of tones.
"If several tones [Tbne] are produced at the same time, the

simultaneous forces, and the two following laws will hol.
good: If the forces act all in the same direction, the amplitude is proportional to the sum of the forces; if the forces act
in opposite directions, the amplitudes are proportional to the
difference of the opposing forces.
"If, for example, in the case of three tones, we draw the
-curve of condensation of each separately, then by a summation of the ordinates pf corresponding abscissas, we can determine new ordinates and develop a new curve, which might be
called the combination curve. This represents exactly what.
our ear perceives of the three simultaneous tones. The fact
that the musician can distinguish the three tones need not surprise us any more than the fact that any one acquainted with
the theory of colors can in green discover blue and yellov; but
the combination curves in Plate I. show that this difficulty is
a slight one, for in these curves all the relations of the components successively recur. In the case of chords of more
than three notes, the relations are not so readily seen from the
drawing, Plate II., for example. In the -case of such chords,
however, the skilled musician also finds difficulty in recognizing the separate notes.
" Plate III. illustrates discord [Dissonanz]. Why discords
impress us unpleasantly I will leave my readers to judge at
this time, though I may perhaps return to the subject subsequently in another paper.
"From the preceding it follows:

on striking our ear, causes vibrations on the drum of the ear,
the succession of which may be represented by a curve. ,

i, Second. The succession of these vibrations alone gives us
a conception (sensation) of the tone, and every alteration
changes the conception (sensation).
."As soon, then, as it is possible to produce, anywhere and
in any manner, vibrations whose curves shall be the same as
those of any given tone or combination of tones, we shall
receive the same impression as that tone or combination of
tones would have produced on us.
"With the above principles as a foundation, I have succeeded in constructing an apparatus with which I am enabled
to reproduce the tones of various instruments, and even to a
certain extent the human voice. It -is very simple, and by
means of the figure will be easily understood from the following explanation:

"In the cubical block of wood r' s t~ i&v w x there is a conical perforation a, closed at one end by a membrane b (pig's
intestine), upon the middle of which there is cemented a conducting strip of platinum; this is connected with the binding
screw _p -[auf deren Mitte emn stromleitendes Streifchen Platin,

the membrane, and ends here in a platinum wire placed at
right angles to its length and surface.
"From the binding screw p, a conducting wire runs through
the battery to a distant station, being connected with a coil of
silk-covered copper wire, and this again is connected with a
conductor leading back to the binding screw n.
"The coil at the distant station is about six inches long, is
composed of six layers of fine wire, and, as a core in its centre,
has a knitting-needle which projects about two inches at both
ends. :By means of the projecting ends, the coil rests upon
two bridges of a resonant case. (All this part can, of course,
be replaced by any other apparatus by means of which the
well-knom ' galvanic tones' can be produced.)
"If now tones or combinations of tones are produced in the
neighborhood of the block, so that sufficiently powerful waves
enter the opening a, then these sounds cause the membrane b
to vibrate. At the first condensation the hammer-like wire d
is pushed back; at the rarefaction it cannot follow the retreating membrane, and the current traversing the strips remains
broken [Strom bleibt so lange unterbrochen bis, etc.], until the
membrane forced by a new condensation again presses the
strip (proceeding from 2 ) against d. In this way each sound
wave causes a breaking and closing [ein Oeffnen und ein
Schliessen] of the current [Stromes].
"At each closing [Schliessen] of the circuit [Kette], the
atoms of the iron wire inside the distant spiral are moved
away from each other (Pouillet Miuller, p. 304, Vol. II., fifth
edition); on breaking the circuit [beim TUnterbrechen des
Stromes], these atoms seek to regain their position of equilibrium. When this happens, in consequence of the reciprocal
actions of elasticity and inertia, a number of vibrations are
produced, and they give the longitudinal sound of the rod (see
as above). This is the case if the making and breaking of the
current [Unterbrechungen und Schliessungen des Stromes]
occur with comparative slowness. If they occur more rapidly
than the oscillations of the iron core, due to its elasticity, the
atoms cannot complete their course. The paths described become shorter in proportion as the interruptions are more frequent, but then are just as numerous as these.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Statement of the Case.

"The iron wire no longer gives its longitudinal normal tone,
but a tone whose pitch corresponds to the number of interruptions [Unterbrechungen] (in a given time); this is the same
as saying that the rod reyrodzwes the tone [Ton] impressed upon,
the interrupter [dem Unter brechungsapparat]. The intensity
also of this tone is proportional to that of the original one,
for in proportion as this is more intense, the motions of the
membrane are greater; the motions of the hammer, also, and
finally the time during which the circuit remains opened, is
greater; and consequently, up to a certain limit, the motions
of the atoms in the reproducing wire are greater, we perceiving them as greater vibrations, in just the same way as
we would have perceived the original sound-wave.
"As the length of the conducting wire can undoubtedly be
made as great as in direct telegraphy, I have called my instrument ' telephone.'
"Now, in reference to the capabilities of the telephone, it
may be stated that I was enabled to render audible to the
members of a large assembly (The Physical Society at Frankfort-a-M.) melodies which were sung (not very loud) into the
apparatus in another house (three hundred feet away) with
closed doors.
"Other experiments showed that the sounding wire was
capable of reproducing complete chords of three tones of a
piano, upon which the telephone was placed, and that it reproduces equally well the tones of other instruments, accordion, clarinet, horn, organ pipes, etc., provided that the tones
are within the compass F - f.
"Of course, in all experiments, sufficient precautions were
taken to insure that there was no direct conduction of sound.
This is very easily done by making a monientary short circuit
immediately in front of the coil, by which means its action is
temporarily interrupted.
"Hitherto it has not been possible to reproduce the tones
bf human speech [Tonsprache des Menschen] with a distinctness
sufficient for every one. The consonants are for the most
part reproduced pretty distinctly, but the vowels as yet not
in an equal degree. The cause of this I will attempt to
explain.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Statement of the Case.

'According

to the experiments of Willis, Helmholtz and
others, vowel tones can be produced artifically, if the vibrations of one body are from time to time augmented by those
of another, somewhat as follows:
"An elastic spring is set in vibration by the blow of a tooth
on a toothed wheel; the first vibration is the greatest, and
each subsequent one is smaller than the preceding.

"If, after a few vibrations of this kind (the spring not coming to rest in the mean time), the tooth wheel imparts a new
stroke, the following vibration will be again a maximum, and
so on.
"The pitch of the tone produced in this way depends upon
the number of vibrations in a given time, but the character of
the tone upon the number of swellings [Anschwellungen] in
the same time. Two vowels having the same pit6h would
differ in about the way represented by the curve (Figs. 1, 2),
while the same tone without any vowel character would be
represented by the curve (Fig. 3).

"Our organs of speech probably produce the vowels in the
same manner, through the combined action of the upper and
lower vocal cords, or of these latter and the cavity of the
mouth.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Statement of the Case.

"My apparatus reproduces the number of vibrations, but
with an intensity much less than that of the original ones;
though, as I have reason to believe, to -acertain degree proportional among themselves. But in the case of these generally small vibrations, the difference between large and small
vibrations is more difficult to perceive than in the case of the
original waves, and the vowel is therefore more or less indistinct.
"Whether or not my views as to the curves corresponding
to sound combinations are correct could perhaps be decided
by means of the new phonautograph of Duhamel (' Vierordt
Physiologie,' page 254).
"It may be that for the practical application of the telephone much remains to be done; for physics it has already
sufficient interest from the fact that it opens a new field for
research.

produced in the vicinity of the large opening of the conical
cavity so that sufficiently strong waves eater it, these waves
will set the membrane into vibration; by the outward motion
of the membrane the platinum strip cemented on it is pressed
against the hammer-shaped wire d and the galvanic current
[Strom] is closed [geschlossen]; by the inward motion of the
membrane the current is reopened. The alternate magnetizings and demagnetizings of the core of the coil resulting therefrom.will bring forth, if the alternation is slow, the longitudinal tone of the core, and if the alternation Laufeinanderfolge]

reproduction of tones [Tinen] by means of galvanic electricity,
and also what has been hitherto accomplished towards the
realization of this project, in order that the accumulated experiments may serve as a foundation to build upon, and that the
capacity- of the electric current, which by human ingenuity
has already been made serviceable for correspondence, may

the application of this current to the production of audible

"The air waves, which by acting upon the ear excite in us
the sensation of sound by primarily setting the tympanum of
the ear into the vibratory motion, are, as is well known, transmitted to the interior parts of the ear and to the auditory
nerves there located by means of a lever apparatus of wonderful delicacy, the auditory bones (hammer, anvil, stirrup); and
the attempt to reproduce tones therefore depends upon this,

means of the vibrations of a membrane corresponding to the
membrane of the ear drum, and thereby to open and close

"Before describing the apparatus to be used, it would be
proper to inquire how our ear apprehends the vibrations of
any one p.-rticular tone, and the combined vibrations of all
simultaneous tones acting upon it, because thereby we may
determine the operations which are to be performed by the
transmitting and receiving apparatus in the solution of the
problem.
"Examining first the processes which take place in order
that the human ear may apprehend any single tone, we find
that each tone is the result of alternate rarefactions and condensations repeated within a fixed time. If this operation
occurs in the same medium in which the ear is placed, then at

each condensation the membrane is forced toward -the cavity
of the drum and toward the opposite side at each rarefaction.
"These vibrations cause corresponding movements in the
auditory bones, and are thereby transmitted to the auditory
nerves.
"The greater the degree of condensation of the sound-conducting medium is at a given time, the greater will be the
amplitude of vibration of the membrane and auditory bones,
and the greater the consequent result; and in the opposite
case, so much the weaker. Hence it is evidently the function
of the auditory apparatus to impart with faithfulness to the
auditory nerves every condensation and rarefaction which
occurs in the surrounding medium. On the other hand, the
function of transmitting to our consciousness both the number
and amplitude of the resulting vibrations occurring within a
given time devolves upon the auditory nerves.
"It is here, in our consciousness, that a certain complex
phenomenon receives a specific name; it is here, in our consciousness, that the transmitted vibrations become tones
[Ti5ne].
"Accordingly, that which is apprehended by the auditory
nerves is the effect of a force, reaching to our consciousness,
and which can be made more easy of comprehension as to
duration and strength, by graphical delineation.
"For example, let the length of the line a-b represent a
definite period of time, the curves above this line the condensations (-), and the curves below this line the rarefactions

the degree of condensation in consequence of which the membrane of the drum vibrates.

represented in this way, or more than can be represented by
similar curves; this is, however, sufficient to convey to our

consciousness any single tone [Ton] or any desired combinations of tones. For if several tones are generated simultane-,
ously, then the sound-conducting medium is influenced by
several forces, acting at the same time, and subject to mechanical laws.
"If all the forces act in the same direction, then the amount
of motion is in proportion to the sum of all the forces; if on
the other hand the forces act in opposing directions, then the
amount of motion is in proportion to the difference between
the opposing forces.
"From these principles it follows that the curves representing the condensations of a number of simultaneously generated
tones may be combined in a single curve of condensation,
which will indicate with precision what our ear apprehends
through the reception of these simultaneously acting tones.
"The objection generally made to this proposition, that a
musician, or any person, is able to distinguish the simple tones
out of which these composite curves are formed or arise, should
not be allowed to militate against it; as it is also possible
for some who are familiar with the study of colors to distinguish, in green, for example, the mixture of yellow and blue,
in their varied shades ; and the one phenomenon as well as
the other is referable to the fact that in both cases the observer is familiar with the factors of that product which has
been conveyed to his consciousness.
"By the explanations heretofore given, it is easy to construct the curves representing the condensations of various
tones, chords, etc., and a few examples are given by way of
illustration:
"Fig. 1, Plate VIII., represents a composite'curve formed
of three tones, in which all the proportions of the components
recur successively.
"Fig. 2 represents a similar curve formed of more than three
tones; in this case, however, it is no longer possible to represent the proportions so clearly in the drawing, yet an experienced musician will be able to discern them even here, although
in practice it might be difficult even for him to recognize the
separate tones in such a chord.

"This apparent digression from the subject under consideration was necessary to demonstrate that as soon as we are able,
in any pace and in any manner, to reproduce vibrations of
such curves and intensities as are' equivalent to the curves and
intensities of the vibrations of any particular tone, or of any
particular combination of tones, we shall have the same impressions as were produced upon us by this original toae, or
these original combinations of tones.
"The apparatus described hereafter offers the possibility of
producing these vibrations in every manner desired; and by
the use of galvanic electricity it is possible to evoke, at any
distance, vibrations like [gleiche] those which have been so
produced, and in this way to reproduce at any place the tones
which have been generated at another place.
"In Plate IX., Fig. I A is the tone transmitter [Tonengeber], and B the tone receiver [Tonenpfanger], and these two
instruments are set up at different stations. I must observe
at the outset that the arrangement of the instruments for
sending backw'ards and forwards is omitted for greater clearness; and likewise, as the whole thing is not presented. as a
completed fact, but only to call to the notice of a wider circle
what has been already ascertained, the possibility of the working of the apparatus at a distance greater than the limited
direct working allows at present is left out of consideration,
since these points are easily accomplished by mechanical
arrangements, and since the most important facts of the phenomena treated are not influenced thereby.
"Let us now turn to the tone transmitter, Fig. 4 A. This
on the one hand is connected by tha metallic conductor with
the tone receiver, Fig. 4 B, at a neighboring station; on the
other hand it is connected by means of the electric battery C
with the earth (or with the metallic return conducto). The
tone transmitter, Fig. 4 A, consists of a conical tube a 6, about

15 centimetres in length, having a front opening of about 10
centimetres, and a rear opening of about 4 centimetres.
"(It appears by practical experiments that neither the material of this tube nor any increase in its length influenced the
accuracy of the action of the apparatus. An enlargement of
the diameter of the tube impairs the working 9f the apparatus, and it is desirable that the inner surface of the tube be
as smooth as possible.) The smaller or rear end of the tube is
closed by a collodion membrane o, and upon the centre of the
circular surface of this membrane rests one end c of the lever
c d, the supporting point e of which is sustained by a bracket,
and is kept in electrical connection with the metallic conductor. The proper lengths of the respective arms c e and e d of
this lever are regulated by the laws of the lever. It is advisable to make the arm c e longer than the arm e d, in order
that the least motion at e may operate with greatest effect at
d. - It is also desirable that the lever itself be made as light as
possible, that it may follow the movements of the membrane.
Any inaccuracy in the operation of the lever o d in this respect
will prod-dee false tones at the receiving station. When in a
state of rest the contact at dg is closed, and a delicate spring
n maintains the lever in this position.
"The second part of the apparatus, the standard f, consists
of a metallic support, connected with one pole of the battery
0, the other pole of which is connected to the earth, or to a
metallic return wire leading to the other station.
"Upon the standardf is arranged a spring g, with a contact
-point corresponding to the contact point d of the lever 0 d;
the position of g is regulated by the screw A.
"In order not to impair the operation of the apparatus by
the action of the air waves against the rear side of the membrane, it is desirable to place upon tube ab, a disk of about
fifty centimetres in diameter at right angles to the longitudinal
:axis of the tube a b ; this disk may be attached to the tube by
.a fastening surrounding its outer circumference.
"The tone receiver, Fig. 4 B, consists of an electro-magnet

"Facing the electro-magnet m m is an armature, to which
is attached a very long but light and broad lever i.
"The lever i with the armature is suspended from the standard k in the manner of a pendulum, its motion being regulated by means of the screw 1 and the spring q.
"In order to increase the effect of the apparatus, the tone
receiver may be placed at one of the focal points of an elliptically arched chamber of suitable size, and the listener may
place his ear at the other focus of this chamber.
"The operation of the apparatus described is as follows:
"When at rest the galvanic circuit [Kette] is closed. When
the air, which is in the tube a b of the apparatus, Fig. 4 A, is
alternately condensed and rarefied, by speaking into it (or by
singihg or introducing the tones of an instrument), a movement of the membrane closing the smaller opening of the tube
is produced, corresponding to such condensation or rarefaction.
The lever c d follows the movements of the membrane, and
opens and closes [6ffnet und schliesst] the galvanic circuit
[Kette] at dg, so that at each condensation of the air in the
tube the circuit is opened, and at each rarefaction the circuit
is closed [ein Oeffnen und ein Schliessen erfolgt].
"In consequence of this operation, the electro-magnet of the
apparatus, Fig. 4 B; in accordance with the condensations and
rarefactions of the column of air in the tube a b,Fig. 4 B, is
correspondingly demagnetized and magnetized [demagnetisirt
und magnetisirt], and the armature of the magnet is set into
vibiations like those of the membrane in the transmitting
apparatu. But the beam [Balken] i attached to the armature
communicates these corresponding vibrations of the armature
to the air surrounding the apparatus Fig. 4 B, which finally
transmits the vibrations so produced to the ear of the listener.
"1We have not here to consider the question of the transmission [Fortpflanzfing] of tones by means of the galvanic current, but only of the conveyance [Uebertragring] of generatea
sounds to another place, and in this way, that at the latter
place a similar cause is produced, and a similar effect obtained.
It must not be ignored, h6wever, that while the apparatus described reproduces the exact number of the original vibrations,

but not of the same strength [die gleiche Starke der reproducirten Schwingngen noch nicht erreicht nurde] ; and that
the achievement of this result is reserved for an improvement
of the apparatus.
"In consequence of the imperfection of the apparatus at
this time, the minor differences of the original vibrations are
distinguishable with more difficulty, - that is, the vowel
sounds appear more or less indistinct, -inasmuch
as each
tone depends not merely upon the number of the vibrations
of the medium, but also upon its condensation and rarefaction.
"This also explains why chords and melodies were transmitted with marvellous accuracy in the practical experiments
hitherto made, while single words in reading, speaking, &c.,
were less distinctly recognizable, although even in these the inflections of the voice, as in interrogation, exclamation, surprise,
calling, &c., were clearly reproduced.
"There is no doubt that the subject we have been considering, before it becomes practically valuable for use, will require
considerable improvement; it will especially be necessary to
perfect the mechanism of the apparatus to be employed; but
I am convinced, by repeated practical experiments, that it is
of the greatest theoretic interest to pursue these investigations,
and also that a development of practical value will not elude
our intelligent century."

".Dear Sir:
"I am very sorry not to have been in Frankfort when you
were there at Mr. Albert's, by whom I have been informed
that you have purchased one of my newly invented instruments (telephons), though I will do all in my power to give
you the most ample explanations on the subject. I am sure
that personal communication would have been preferable,
specially as I was told that you will show the apparatus at
your next scientific meeting, and thus introduce the apparatus in your country.
"Tunes and sounds of any kind are only brought to our conception by the condensations and rarefactions of air or any
other medium in which we may find ourselVes. By every condensation the tympanuin of our ear is pressed inwvards, by
every rarefaction it is pressed outward, and thus the tympanuih
performs oscillations like a pendulum. The smaller or greater
number of the oscillations made in a second gives us, by help
of the small bones in our ear and the auditory nerve, the idea
of a higher or lower tune.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Statement of the Case.

"It was no hard labor, either to imagine that any other'membrane beside that of our ear could be brought to make similar
bscillations, if spanned in a proper manner and if taken in good
proportions, or to make use of these oscillations for the interruption of a galvanic current. However, these were the principles which guided me in my invention; they were sufficient
to induce me to try the reproduction of tunes at any distance.
It would be long to relate all the fruitless attempts I made
until I found out the proportions of the instrument and the
necessary tension of the membrane. The apparatus you have
bought is now what may be found most simple, and works
without failing, when arranged carefully in the following
manner: [See page 57 for plate.]
"The apparatus consists of two separated parts, one for the
singing station, A, and the other for the hearing station, B.
"The apparatus A is a square box of wood, the cover of which
shows the membrane, c, on the outside, under glass. In the
middle of the latter is fixed a small platina plate to which a
flattened copper wire is soldered, on purpose to conduct the
galvanic current. Within the 6ircle you will further'remark
two screws; one of them is terminated by a little pit in which
you put a little drop of quicksilver, the other is pointed.. The
angle, which you will find lying on the membrane, is to be
placed according to the letters, with the little hole a on the
point a, the little platina foot b into the quicksilver screw; the
other platina foot will then come on the platina plate in the
middle of the membrane.
"The galvanic current coming from the battery (which I
compose generally of three or four good elements) is introduced at the conducting screw near b, wherefrom it proceeds
to the quicksilver, the movable angle, the platina plate and
the complementary telegraph to the conducting screw s.
From here it goes through the conductor to the other station
B, and from there returns to the battery.
"The apparatus B, a sonorous box on the cover of which is
fixed the wire spiral with the steel axis, which will be magnetic when the current goes through the spiral. A second
little box is fixed on the first one, and laid down on the steel

axis to increase the intensity of the reproduced sounds. On
the small side, of the lower box you will find the corresponding part of the complementary telegraph.
"If a person sing at the station A, in the tube x,the vibrations of air will pass into the box and move the membrane
above, thereby the platina foot c of the movable angle will be
'lifted up, and thus will open the stream at every condensation,
of air in -the box. The stream will'be re-established at every
rarefaction. In this manner the steel axis at station B will be
magnetic once for every full vibration, and, as magnetism never
enters nor leaves a metal without disturbing the equilibrium
of the atoms, the steel axis at station B must repeat the vibrations at station A, and then reproduce the sounds which caused
them. Any sound will be reproduced if strong enough to set
the membrane in motion.
"The little telegraph which you find on the side of the apparatus is very useful and agreeable for to give signals between
both of the correspondents. At every opening of the stream,
and next following shutting, the station A will hear 'a little
clap, produced by the attraction of the steel spring. Another
little clap will be heard. at station B in the wire spiral. By
multiplying the claps and producing them in different measures, you will be able as well as I am to get understood by
your correspondent.
"I am to end, Sir, and I hope that what I said will be sufficient to have a first try; afterwards you will get on quite
alone.
I am, Sir,

" Having succeeded two years ago in demonstrating the possibility of reproducing tones with the aid of the galvanic current and in manufacturing an apparatus for that purpose, the
subject has been so highly appreciated by the most renowned
men of science, and I have received so many encouragements,
that I have striven since that time to improve my originally
very imperfect -apparatus, in order to give to others also the

"I am now able to offer an apparatus which satisfies my expectations, and with which every physicist will succeed in
repeating these interesting experiments regarding the reproduction of tone (Ton =reproduction) at distant stations.
I'.believe that it is the wish of many that these instruments
should come into the possession of laboratories; as, however,
their manufacture demands a complete knowledge of the leading principles and a great experience in this matter, I have
resolved to make the most important parts myself, and to
intrust to the mechanician only the secondary parts and the

"The apparatus consists of two parts, as may be seen in the

distance from each other that singing or the sound of a musical instrument can be heard in no other manner except through
the apparatus from one station to another.
"Both parts are connected with each other and with the
battery B, the same as in an ordinary telegraph. The battery
must be sufficient to produce at station A the attraction of the
armature of the electro-magnet placed at one side (three or
four six-inch Bunsen cells are sufficient for several handred
feet of distance).
"The galvanic current then goes from B to the binding post

"THE MUSICAL TELEGRAPH.

"The surprising results in telegraphing have often excited
the question whether it may not be possible to communicate
the language of sound itself to 'a distance. The trials made
in this direction had, till now, produced no satisfactory results,
because'the vibrations of sound-conducting bodies' soon diminish so much in force that 'they are no more perceptible for our
senses.
"People, perhaps, had already thought of a reproduction of
sound at certain distances with the aid of the electric current,
but those who have been the best fitted to attack the question,
by their knowledge and resources, were the ones who doubted
the most of a practical solution of that question. Those who
are but superficially acquainted with natural science do not
see the many difficulties this problemn offers, if they are at all
acquainted with it. Thus, about eleven years ago, a young
man, Mr. Philipp IReis, at present teacher of natural science at
the Gamier Institute for Boys, at Friedrichsdorf, near Homburg, had the hardihood to work at the solution of this problem. But soon he was obliged to desist from it because his
very first effort seemed to convince him of the impossibility of
a solution. Later, however, after further, studies and many
experiments, he saw that his firsteffort was but a rudimentary
one, and by no means convincing. However, he did not
recommence to attack the questioR -seriously for some time,
not feeling himself strong enough to vanquish the obstacles
on his road, although he never banished his earl, idea entirely
from his thoughts.
"How can a single instrument reproduce simultaneously ' the
combined effects of all the organs active in human speech ?'
This seemed to him the chief question. Later he put this
question more methodically: ' How does our ear perceive the
composite vibrations of all the organs of speech acting at the

same time V or, expressed more generally, *How do we perceive the vibrations of several bodies sounding simultaneously?'
If we throw a stone into quiet water there are produced on
the surface uniform waves which progress symmetrically outward; the further they go the weaker they become, till they
finally disappear.
"It is quite similar with that which we call sound and tone.
A body made to vibrate through any impulse affects the surrounding air, and causes waves in it, which follow each other
at the same rate as the vibrations of the body. As those
rings on the water consist in swellings and depressions, so also
the vibrations of the air consist of alternate' condensations and
rarefactions. If they reach our ear every condensation presses
the tympanum towards the interior of the cavity, and puts in
motion the adjacent group of small bones which communicates
the motion to the liquid of the cochlea, in which the auditory
nerves terminate. The latter are excited and produce the
sensation of sound.

"1Now, if the waves of vibration follow regularly and with
a certain swiftness (sixteen in the second at least), we shall
have the sensation of a musical tone. The latter is the higher
the quicker the condensations follow each other and the louder
the stronger or higher the waves rise, as it were.
"Our ear cannot perceive anything except condensations
and rarefactions, wave crests and wave hollows. And, nevertheless, we. receive the most varied auditory impressions, we
distinguish the sound of the voices, we hear at the same time
in quite different directions and can distinguish the different
sources; nay, in a complete large orchestra, each of the
numerous instruments is specially noticed by its peculiar
sound, so that we decompose at every moment the total
impression into its several parts, according to the height and
depth, strength and weakness, or according to the timbre (or
quality) [Klangfarbe].
"Referring to our simile, this is about the same as if we
throw two or more stones at different places into a calm pond.
The wave lines cross each other, strengthen each other at some
points, weaken each other at others, and the surface has a rufVOL. CXX.VI-5

fled, hillocked aspect. But, nevertheless, our, eye can detect
the different systems of rings and can trace them back to
their several causes. If we succeed in transmitting with the
galvanic current the oscillations of a sounding body to a distance, so that there another body is put to equally rapid and,
in respect to each other, equally strong oscillations, the problem of ' telephoning' is solved.
"For then exactly the same phenomena of waves are calledforth on the distant points as the ear receives at the place of
origin; therefore they also must make the same impression.
The ear will distinguish at the distant points not only the
single tones, according to their varying height and depth, but
also to the proportionate force of the vibrations, and not only
single melodies, but the performance of a whole orchestra;
yes, even speech must be heard at the same time in places
very distant from each other. Mr. Reis was the first one to
prove by experiments the possibility of solving this problem.
He has succeeded in constructing an apparatus to which he
-gives the name Ielephone, and which enables one to reproduce
tones, with the aid of electricity, at any given distance.
Already, in October, 1861, he made rather.successful experiments with a very simple, rudely made apparatus, before a
numerous audience at Frankfort. On July 4th of the present
year he presented an essentially improved apparatus at an
assembly of the 'Physical Union,' which transmitted by
closed doors and windows a melody sung moderately loud,
to a distance of about three hundred feet, so that it could be
heard pZaink.

"In order to give an opportunity to larger circles, especially
to scientific men, to convince themselves of the efficiency of
this essehtially improved apparatus, Professor Bhttger ofFrankfort-a-M. made lately (at an assembly of German physicists and doctors in Stettin, in the sectional meetings for
natural sciences) several experiments which certainly would
have been crowned with stillmore success if the hall in which
the session was held had been located in a less noisy part of.
the city and filled with a less numerous audience.

be able to converse with a friend at a distance of several hundred miles, so much at least is certain, that vith the aid of the
telephone songs of all kinds, melodies, especially in the middle
registers, can be reproduced most clearly at unlimited distances.
These wonderful results are obtained with the following simple apparatus, which we show here in one-fourth of its size:

"A small box A (the telephone proper), a kind of hollow
cube, has a mouthpiece S on the front side, and a somewhat
smaller opening on the upper side of the box. The latter is

If one sings into the mouthpiece S (by filling the same
entirely with the mouth), the thiin membrane vibrates, and the
attached platina strip receives likewise a vibrating motion so
that it is alternately pressed against and leaves the platina

tricity is led through a wire attached to the second pole of the
battery.to the distant station C; there at i it passes through a
coil i formed of copper wire covered with silk thread, then
back again to screw f, and there to the platina point k. At
every vibration of the membrane an interruption of the electric
current [unterbrechung des electrischen Stromes] takes place
'by the platina point parting from the platina strip.
"Within the wire coil at station C is a thin iron wire (a'
strong knitting-needle) which is about ten inches long, and
which with its two ends projecting out of the coil for about two
inches, each rests on two bridges of a sounding box. This is
the reyroducng apparatus.
"At every interruption of the current [Unterbrechung des
Stromes] in the coil the iron rod is made to vibrate. 'If the
motions follow with a certain rapidity, they produce a tone
which is rendered audible by the sounding box. As the rate
of the interruptions depends on the pitch of the tone that has
been sung into the mouthpiece, the same tone is sounded with
the same pitch from the sounding box. The length of the
circuit has no influence upon this. It is true the electric current loses force the farther it goes, but there is no reason why
relays should not be employed, the same as in telegraphing,
and with their aid any number of reproducing apparatuses be
set into simultaneous vibrations. Mr. Reis has endeavored to
give to his improved apparatus a form which should also be
pleasing to the eye, so that it might fill worthily its place in
any physical laboratory. He has applied, moreover, to the
side of the telephon6, as well as to the reproducing apparatus,
a small telegraph arrangement, which is a very good addition
for convenient experimenting. (It is indicated in the drawing
by the'letters e f h g.) By alternately opening and closing

sal Schwingungen]. A phenomenon [Erscheinung] has other.wise been heard of, which belongs to the afore-mentioned
class, in which the intensity and the timbre [Klang] of the
sound accompanying it (the phenomenon) depend among other
things on the strength of the current [StromstUrke] and on
the number of breaks of the same, and in which, as it seems,
the pitch of the tones also can vary under different circumstances. We can, however, hardly imagine by what arrangements it could be feasible to coax tones of any given height or.
depth out of an iron or metal tube split on one side, while it
(the tube) is affected by the alternate currents of an induction
apparatus the coil (Rolle) of which surrounds it. Yet the possibility cannot be controverted that the principle of Neef's
circuit-breaker [Unterbrecher] might contribute to the solution
of the problem in question. It has been employed for local
purposes either with or without modifications in the study and
investigation of acoustic phenomena. Thus Petrina has used
the principle of Keefs circuit-breaker [Unterbrecher] for his
electric harmonica in this way, that instead of the Neef hammer a little rod was chosen, the transverse vibration of which
rendered the tone. ' There are four little rods of various
'lengths side by side, the motions of which are checked by
means of 16vers managed by finger keys.' That principle was
used previously by Dove, in a modified manner, to set strained
strings and elastic springs into acoustic vibrations of constant,
amplitude by means of an electric magnet, and, in this way, to
be enabled to investigate constant tones. It appears from
Legat's published communications that 'the ideas submitted
by Ph. Reis of Friedrichsdorf in the Physical Society and in
the meeting of the German Hochstift in Frankfurt-aM. about
the reproduction of sounds by means of electricity' referred
to arrangements of a similar kind. Legat mentions in his
paper all that has been done thus far towards the realization
of that project, and we borrow from it that part only which
throws some light on the construction of a telegraphic apparatus with which it is said.iz;be possible to produce vibrations

bring forth at any given distance vibrations similar to the first
produced ones, and in this way to reproduce at a certain place
tones originally produced at another place.
"This apparatus is composed of a transmitter and of a receiver. The transmitter (see page 531) consists in a conical
tube a b about 15 cm. long, 10 cm. at the front, 4 cm. at
the back opening; the choice of the material as well as a
greater length is indifferent; a greater width, on the contrary,
is disadvantageous; the surface of the interior must be as
smooth as possible. The narrower back opening is closed by
a membrane of collodion o, and on the middle of the circular
surface formed by this membrane rests one end c of lever c d,
the fulcrum of which is held by a support and remains connected with the metallic circuit. This lever, one arm coe of
which must be considerably longer than e d, should be as light
as possible so as to follow easily the motions of the membrane,
as an uncertain obedience [folgen] on part of lever ccd would
produce imperfect tones at the receiving station. In the state
of rest, the contact dg is shut and a weak spring n holds the
lever fast at rest. On the metallic support f which is connected with one of the poles of the battery is a spring g, with
a contact which touches the contact of lever c c at d and the
position of which is regulated by screw A; over tube a b a disk'
must be placed which encircles the outer circumference of the
tube closely, so that the efficacy of the apparatus may not be
impaired through the effect of the air-waves coming round
and striking against the rear end. This disk at right angles
with longitudinal axis of the tube measures about fifty(?) cm.
in diameter. The receiver (page 53) consists of an electromagnet m m which rests on a sounding board, and the coil of
which is in connection with the metallic conductors and with
the ground. Opposite the electro-magnet is an armature connected with a lever as long as possible, but light and broad,
which latter, with the armature, is fastened pendulum-like on
the support k. Its motions are regulated through screw 1 or
spring o. ' In order to increase the efficacy of the apparatus,

this receiver can be placed in one focus of an ellipsoidal enclosing box of suitable size, while the ear of the hearer is placed
at the other focus.' The working of the two apparatus (the
mode of connection of which is visible in the wood-cuts), th6
transmitter being placed at one station and the receiver at
the other, is as follows: By speaking, singing, or the intro-mission of instrumental sounds into tube a b, in consequence
of the condensation and rarefaction of the column of air, a
motion of the membrane c corresponding to these changes is
brought about. Lever c d follows the motions of the membrane, and opens or closes the circuit, according as a con densation or a rarefaction of the air. inside takes place. As a
consequence the electro-magnet mm (Fig. 505) is correspondingly demagnetized or magnetized, and the armature affixed
to it (as well as the armature lever) is set into similar vibrations as themembrane of the transmitter. Through lever i
connected with the armature, similar vibrations are communicated to the surrounding air and (the increasing effect of the
sounding board helping) the tones so produced finally reach
the ear of the listener. In respect to the operations of this
apparatus, the author remarks that the receiver does reproduce the exact number of the original vibrations, but that a
reproduction of the original intensity has not yet been attained.
For that reason, it is added, small differences in the vibrations
are appreciated with difficulty, and in the practical experiments
made thus far, it was possible to transmit with astonishing
faithfulness chords, airs, etc., whilst in reading, speaking, etc.,
single words were more indistinctly heard. The apparatus just
described is said to. have been one of the constructions which
Reis has used himself in his experiments. The underlying
principles might give hopes of a farther improvement of the
apparatus, but the telephone which, according to later reports,
Reis has finally decided upon, has the disposition (represented
on page '73), although the principle on which it is founded does
not stand quite in harmony with the above-mentioned investigations of Wertheim, for instance.
"The telephone proper, A, consists of a hollow wooden box
provided with a short sound-funnel S, and the upper side of

which is open in the centre and covered over tightly with a
delicate membrane, On the middle of the latter a thin platinum disk is fastened, from which on one side a platinum strip,
establishes circuit connection with the contact of the key at
e, from which place the metallic connection is effected with
one end of the coil of a small electro-magnet provided with a
spring armature, whilst the other end is in contact with screw
f. The reproducing apparatus 0 set up at the receiving station consists simply of a coil about six inches long formed by

winding six layers of copper wire; in the axis of the coil a
thin iron wire ten inches long (a knitting needle), protruding
out of each end of the coil about two inches, is so disposed
that with its bridge-like supports it rests on a sounding board.
By means of screw i and of the key at Ag the coil is thrown
into the circuit and the connection of both apparatuses is
effected in the manner mentioned; a battery being placed at
B, the course of the current is easily followed out. It can flow
from B through do and o b to e and f, and from here to the
receiving station, and at i return to the battery, or it can start
in the opposite direction according as d or i forms the starting
point of the current. The circuit can be broken at will at
each of the two stations by pressing the key lever, and a connection can be established thus in either direction, but the

'discontinuous currents which are to produce the sounding of
ihe iron wire at C are obtained in this way: By singing or
the blowing of instruments towards the sound-funnel S the
membrane at A is made to vibrate; if this can be brought
about, it will happen, as was demonstrated by the experiments,
that the iron wire of the receiver assumes isochronal vibrations, and whenever this is the case, it reproduces the same
tones which set the membrane to vibrating at the transmitting
stations.
" My own experiments have demonstrated that every melody
starting from c and embracing the entire extent of an average
male voice, when-sung into the telephone, can be reproduced
-by the receiver at C. The timbre [Klang] or quality of- the
sounds thus reproduced is not pleasant,- they are almost like
the sounds of toy trumpets, at times also like the buzz of a fly
caught in a spider's web and the like; yet the experiments of
Reis are certainly interesting enough to challenge attention.
"A reproduction of the words spoken into the telephone with,
or without variation of pitch was audible at the receiver only
in a corresponding noise [entsprechendes Ger~iusch], while a
discriminate perception of single vocal sounds, syllable or
words could not be had. According to communications made
on this subject by Reis, he has succeeded in reproducing the
tones of organ pipes not covered, and those of a piano; in
this latter case the transmitter was placed on the sounding
board of the piano."

Chambers, London and Edinburgh, 1867.

"The telephone. This is an instrumenit for telegraphing
notes of the same pitch. Any noise producing a single vibration of the air, when repeated regularly a certain number of
times in the second (not less than thirty-two), produces, as is
well known, a musical sound. In Art. 115, we found that
when a rod of iron was placed in a coil of insulated wire, and
magnetized by a current being sent through the coil, it gave
out a distinct tick when it Was demagnetized by the stoppage

Statement of the Case.

of the current. A person when singing any note causes the
air to vibrate so many times per secbnd, the number varying
with the pitch of the note he sings, the higher the note the
greater being the number of vibrations. If we then, by any
means, can get these vibrations to break a closed circuit in
which the coil just mentioned is included, the note sung at one
station can be reproduced, at least so far as pitch is concerned,
at another. Reis's telephone (invented 1861) accomplishes this
in the following way:"A A (Fig. 141) is a hollow wooden box with two round
holes in it, one on the top, the other in front. The hole at'
the top is closed by a piece of bladder S, tightly stretched on
a circular frame; a mouthpiece IMis attached to the front
opening.

"When a person sings in at the mouthpiece, the whole force
of his voice is concentrated on the tight membrane, which in
consequence vibrates with the voice. A thin strip of platinum
is glued to the membrane, and connected with the binding
screw a, in which a wire from the battery B is fixed. A
tripod e f g rests on the skin. The feet e and f lie in metal
cups on the circular frame over which the skin is stretched.
One of these, f, rests in a cup containing mercury, and is connected with the binding screw b. The third foot g, consisting
of a platinum point, lies on the circular end of the strip of
platinum just mentioned. This point, being placed on the
centre of the oscillating membrane, acts like a hopper, and
hops up and down with it. It is easy to understand how, for
every vibration of the membrane, the hopper will be thrown

Statement of the Case.

up for the instant from connection with its support, and how
the- close circuit is thus broken at every vibration. The receiving apparatus R consists 6f a coil of wire placed in circuit,
enclosing an iron wire, both being fixed on a sounding box.
The connections of the various parts of the circuit are easily
learned from the figure. Suppose a person to sing a note at
the mouthpiece which produces three hundred vibrations a
second, the circuit is broken by the bladder three hundred
times, and the iron wire ticking at this rate gives out a note
of the same pitch. The note is weak, and in quality resembles
the sound of a toy trumpet. Dr. Wright uses a receiving apparatus of the following kind: The line current is made to
pass through the primary coil of a small induction coil. In
the secondary circuit he places two sheets of paper, silvered
on one side, back to back, so as to act as a condenser. Each
current that comes from the sending apparatus produces a
current in the secondary circuit which charges and discharges
the condenser, each discharge being accompanied by a sound
like the sharp tap of a small hammer. The musical notes are
rendered by these electric discharges, and are loud enough to
be heard in a large hall."
All contended that the inventions were not novel, and set
up prior inventions and discoveries by other persons and other
patentees. Of the many, persons named in the answers
by whom the inventions covered by the first patent were
averred to have been invented, known or used prior to Bell's
invention, in the arguments in this court the following were
chiefly relied upon. (1) The Philipp Reis invention, already
described; (2) The invention of Elisha -Gray of Chicago;
(3) The invention of Daniel Drawbaugh of Eberly's Tfills in
Pennsylvania; (4I) the' inventions patented to C. F. Varley
in the Unit6d .States,, Jun e 2, 1868, and in Great Britain,
October 8, 1870; (5) the invention of J. W. MScDonough of
Chicago, for which he applied for a patent in 1876; and (6)
the machine constructed in 2ew York in 1869-70 by Dr. Van

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Statement of the Case.

"To all whom it may coneoew:
"Be it known that I, Elisha Gray, of Chicago, in the County
of Cook and'State of Illinois, have invented a new art of
transmitting vocal sounds telegraphically, of which the following is a specification.
"It is the object of my invention to transmit the tones of
the human voice through a telegraphic circuit; and reproduce
them at the receiving end of the line, so that actual conversations can be carried on by persons at long distances apart.
"I have invented and patented methods of transmitting
musical impressions or sounds telegraphically, and my present
invention is based upon the modification of the principle of
said invention which is set forth and described in letters
patent of the United States, granted to me July 27, 1875,
respectively numbered 166,095 and 166,096, and also in an
application for letters patent of the United States, filed by me
February 23, 1875.
"To attain the objects of my invention, I devised an instrument capable of vibrating responsively to all the tones of the
human voice, and by which they are rendered audible.
"In the accompanying drawings I have shown an apparatus
embodying my improvements in the best way now kndwn to
me, but I contemplate various other applications, and also
changes in the details of construction of the apparatus, some
of which would obviously suggest themselves to a skilful electrician, or a person versed in the science of acoustics, on seeing
this application.
"Figure 1 represents a vertical central section through the
'transmitting instrument.
"Fig. 2. A similar section through the receiver; and
"Fig. 3. A diagram representing the whole apparatus.
"My present belief is, that the most effective method of
providing an apparatus capable of responding to the various
tones of the human voice, is a tympanum, drum or diaphragm,
stretched across one end of the chamber, carrying an apparatus for producing fluctuations in the potential of the electric
current, and consequently varying in its -power.
"In the drawings, the person transmitting sounds is shown

Statement of the Case.

as talking into a box, or chamber, A, across the outer end of
which is stretched a diaphragm a, of some thin substance, such
as parchment or gold beater's skin, capable of responding to
all the vibrations of the human voice, whether simple or com-'

plex. Attached to this diaphragm is a light metal rod A', or
other suitable conductor of electricity, which extends into

a vessel B made of glass or other insulating material, having
its lower end closed by a plug, which may be of metal, or
through which passes a conductor b, forming part of the
circuit. This vessel is filled with some liquid possessing high
resistance, such, for instance, as water, so that the vibrations
of the plunger or rod A', which does not quite touch the conductor b, will cause variations in resistance and consequently,
in the potential of the current passing through the rod A'.
"Owing to this construction, the resistance varies constantly,
in response to the vibrations of the diaphragm, which, although
irregrular, not only in their amplitude, but in rapidity, are
nevertheless transmitted, and can, consequently, be transmitted
through a single rod, which could not be done with a positive
make and break of the circuit employed, or where contact
points are used.
"I contemplate, however, the use of a series of diaphragms
in a common vocalizing chamber, each diaphragm carrying an
independent rod, and responding to a vibration of different
rapidity and intensity, in which case, contact points ,mounted
on other diaphragms may be employed.
"The vibrations thus imparted are transmitted through an
electric circuit to the receiving station, in which circuit is
included an electro-magnet of ordinary construction, acting
upon a diaphragm to which is attached a piece of soft iron,
and which diaphragm is stretched across a receiving vocalizing
chamber c, somewhat similar to the corresponding vocalizing
chamber A.
"The diaphragm at the receiving end of the line is thus
thrown into vibration corresponding with those at the transmitting end, and audible sounds or words are produced.
"The obvious practical application of my improvement will
be to enable persons at a distance to converse with each other

Statement of the Case.

One contention of a1 the respondents in regard to th
Gray invention and caveat is stated in the answers of the
Overland People's and Molecular cases in the following
language: - "that it has long been notorious that for years
past interferences have been and now are pending undetermined in the Patent Office between said Bell, Gray, Edison
-and many others, to determine who is the original and first
inventor of the matters described, shown and claimed in said
two patents here in si.it and in each of them respectively;
and that it has long been m-d still is notoriously understood
and believed that the owners of the said Bell patents, distrusting the ultimate result of said pending interferences, and fearing the decision or decisions of the Commissioner of Patents
declaring said Bell not to be the original and first inventor
of the inventions shown in his said patent or patents, have
entered into an agreement and contract, or agreements and
contracts, with said Gray, Edison and others, or with their
assignees, in writing, providing for the contingency of a decision of the Commissioner of Patents adverse to said Bell in
said interferences, and of decisions of the court adverse to said
Bell's claim as the original and first inventor of the matters
claimed in his said patents or either of them, and arranged the
terms and conditions upon which said Bell telephones shall be
licensed by said Gray or by said Edison respectively, or by
their respective assignees in the event that said Gray or
said Edison shall be adjudged the original and first inventor
thereof."

"To all whom it may concern, be it known, that I, Alexander Graham Bell of Salem, Massachusetts, have invented
certain new and useful improvements in Telegraphy, of which
the following is a specification:
"In [another application for] Letters Patent granted to me
[in] April 6th, 1875 (No. 161,739), I have described a method
of and apparatus for transmitting two or more telegraphic
signals simultaneously along a single wire by the employment
of TransmittingInstruments, each of which occasions a succession of electrical impulses differing in rate from the others;
and of Receiv~ng Instruments each tuned to a pitch at which
it will be put in vibration to produce its fundamental tone by
one only 6f -the Transmitting Instruments; and of libratory
Circuit Breakers, operating to convert the vibratory movement of the Receiving Instrument into a permanent make dr
break (as the case may be) of a local circuit in which is placed
a Morse Sounder Register, or other telegraphic apparatus. I

have also therein aescribed a form of Autograph Telegraph
based upon the action of the above mentioned instruments.
"In illustration of my method of Multiple Telegraphy I
have shown in the [aj4plication] PATENT 1 aforesaid, as one form

of Transmitting Instrument an electro-magnet having a steel
spring armature which is kept in vibration by the action of a
local battery. This armature in vibrating makes and breaks
the main circuit, producing an intermittent current upon the
line-wire. I have found, however, that upon. this plan the
limit to the number of signals that can be sent sinultane6usly
over the same circuit is very speedily reached; for when a
number of Transmitting Instruments, having different rates
of vibration, are simultaneously making and breaking the
same circuit, the effect upon the main line is practicaly equivalent to one continuous current.
"Iffy present invention consists in the employment of a
vibratory or undulat[ing]ony current of electricity in place of
a merely intermittent one; and of a method of, and apparatus
for, producing electrical undulations upon the line-wvire. The
advantages [claimed for the undulatory current over the] I

merely intermittent one, are,
"1. That a very much larger number of signals can be
transmitted simultaneously over the same circuit.
"2. That a closed 'circuit and single main battery may be
employed.
"3. That communication in both directions is established
without the necessity of using special induction coils.
"4. And that -as the circuit is never broken - a spark
arrester becomes unnecessary.
"It has long been known that when a permanent magnet is
caused to approach the pole of an electro-magnet a current of
electricity is induced in the coils of the latter, and that when
it is made to recede, a current of opposite polarity to the'fist
appears upon the wire. When, therefore, a permanent magnet is caused to virate in front of the pole of an electroPACE OF A

magnet, an undulatory current of electricity is induced in the
coils of the electro-magnet, the undulations of which correspond in rate of succession to the vibrations of the magnet, in
polarity to the direction of its motion, and in intensity to,the
amplitude of its vibration. That the difference between an
undulatory and an intermittent current may be more clearly
understood, I shall describe the condition of the electrical
current when THE ATTEmPT IS MADE TO TRANSMIT two musical
notes [of different pitch are] simultaneously [transmitted along
the same wire]- FIRST UPON THE ONE PLAN AND THEi UPON THE
OTHER. Let the interval between the two spunds be a major
third. Then their rates of vibration are in the ratio of 4: 5.
"1Now, when the intermittent current is used the circuit is
made and broken four times by one TRANsMTTNG instrument
in the same time that five makes and breaks are caused by the
other [instrument].
. "A' and B (Figs. I., II. and Ill.) represent the intermittent
ciurrents produced.; four impulses of A being .made in the
same time as five impulses of B. o, c, o, &c., show where and
for'how long time the circuit is made, and d, d, d, &c.. indicate
the duration of the breaks of the circuit.
"The line A+ B shows the total effect upon the current
when, the transmitting instruments for A and B are caused
(to] simultaneously to make and break the same circuit. The
resultant effect depends very much upon the duration of the
make relatively to the break. In Fig. I. the rate is as 1 :4.;
in Fig. II. as 1 : 2; and in Fig. III. the makes and breaks are
of equal duration.
"The cdmbined effect A+B (Fig. Ill.) is very nearly equivto a continuous current.
alent
" When many transmitting instruments of
different [pitch]
.ATEs OF vIBRATION are simultaneously making and breaking
the' same circuit,-the current upon the main line [loses altogether its intermittent character and] becomes for all practical
purposes continuous.

"'[But now] lNext consider the effect when an undulatory
current is employed.
1'1lectrical undulations induced by the vibration of a body
capable of inductive action can be represented graphically
without error by the same sinusoidal curve which expresses
the vibration of the inducing body itself, and the effect of its
vibration upon the air.
"For, as above stated, the rate of oscillation- in the electrical current .corresponds to the rate of vibration of the inducing
body, that is, to the pitch, of the sound produced; the intensity of the current varies with the amplitude of vibration,
that is, with the loudness of the sound; and the polarity of
the current corresponds to the direction of the motion of the
vibrating body, that is, to the condensations and rarefactions
of air produced by the vibration. KHence the sinusoidal curve
A or B 1 (Fig. IV.) represents graphically the electrical undulations induced in a circuit by the vibration of a body capable
of inductive action.
"The horizontal line (a,d, bf) represents the zero of current; the elevations (c, c, c) indicate impulses of positive electricity; the . depressions (e, e, e) show impulses of negative
electricity; the vertical distance (cd or ef) of any [point on]
PORTION OF the curve from the zero line expresses the intensity
of the positive or negative impulse at the part OBSERVED; and
the horizontal distance (a, a) indicates the duration of the
electrical oscillation.
"The vibrations represented by the sinusoidal curves A and
B (Fig. IV.) are in the ratio aforesaid, of 4: 5;- that is, four
oscillations of A are made in the same time as five oscillations
of B.
"The combined effect of A and B, when induced simultaneously on the same circuit, is expressed by the curve A:+B
(Fig. IV.), which is the algebraical sum of the sinusoidal curves
A and B. This curve (A+B) also indicates the actual motion
of the air when the two musical notes considered are sounded
simultaneously.

"Thus, when electrical undulations of different rates are
simultaneously induced in the sane circuit, an effect is produced exactly analogous to that occasioned in the air by the
vibration of the inducing bodies.
" Hence the coexistence [of] uPoN a telegraphic circuit of
electrical vibrations of different pitch is manifested,- not by
the obliteration of the vibratory character of the current, but.
by peculiarities in the shapes of the electrical undulations; or,
in other words, by peculiarities in the shapes of the curves
which represent those undulations.
"[Undulatory currents of electricity may be produced in
many other ways than that described above, but all the
methods depend for effect upon the vibration or motion of
bodies capable of inductive action.]
"There are many [other] ways of producing undulatory
currents of electricity, but all of them depend for effect upon

"[I shall specify a few of the methods that may be used to

"When a wire through which a continuous current of electricity is passing is caused to vibrate in the neighborhood of

in the latter.
"When a cylinder upon which are arranged bar-magnets is
made to rotate in front of the pole of an electro-nmagnet an
undulatory current is induced in the coils of the electromagnet.
"Undulations may also be caused in a continuous voltaic
current by the vibration or motion of bodies capable of inductive action, or by the vibration of the conducting wire itself
in the neighborhood of such bodies.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Statement of the Case.

"I prefer to employ for this purpose an electro-magnet (A,
Fig. 5) having a coil upon only one of its legs (6)., A steel
is firmly clamped by one extremity to the
spring armature (c)
uncovered leg (d) of the magnet, and its free end is allowed to
project above the pole of the covered leg. The armature (c)
can be set in vibration in a variety of ways (one of which is
by wind), and in vibrating it yields a musical note of a certain definite pitch.
"When the instrument (A) is placed in a voltaic circuit (g,
b, eJ, g) the armature (c) becomes magnetic, and the polarity
of its free end is opposed to that of the magmet underneath.
So long as the armature (c) remains at rest no effect is produced upon the voltaic current, but the moment it is set in
vibration to produce its musical note a powerful inductive
action takes place, and electrical undulations traverse the circuit (g, b, ef, g). The vibratory current passing through the.
coils of the distant electro-magnet (f) causes vibration in its
armature (A), when the armatures (e, h) of the two instruments (A, I) are norma~ly in unison with one another; but
the armature (h)is unaffected by the passage of the undulatory current when the pitches of the two instruments (A, I)
are different [frnm one another].
"A number of instruments may be placed upon a telegraphic
circuit (as in Fig. VI.). When the armature of any one of tb instruments is set in vibration all the other instruments on the
circuit which are in unison With it respond, but those which
have normally a different rate of vibration remain silent. Thus
if A (Fig. VI.) is set in vibration, the armatures of A' and A'
will vibrate also, but all the others on the circuit remain still.
So also if B' is caused to emit its musical note the instruments
B, B' respond. They continue sounding so long as the mechanical vibration of B' is continued, but become silent the moment
its motion stops. The duration of the sound may be made to
signify the dot or dash of the Morse alphabet, and thus a telegraphic despatch can be transmitted by alternately interrupting and renewing the sound.
"When two or more instruments of different pitch are simultaneously caused to vibrate, all the instruments of correspond-

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Statement of the Case.

ing pitches upon the circuit are set in vibration, each responding to that one only of the Transmitting Instruments with
which it is in unison. Thus the signals of A are repeated by
circuit; the
A' and A2, but by no other instruments upon the
2
1
signals of B2 by B and B', and the signals of C by 0 and C ,
whether A, B 2,and C are successively or simultaneously set
in vibration.
"Hence by these instruments, two or more telegraphic signals or messages may be sent simultaneously over the same
circuit without interfering with one another.
"I desire here to remark that there are many other uses to
which these instruments may be put, such as the simultaneous
transmission of musical notes differing in loudiess as well as in
pitch, and the telegraphic transmission of noises or sounds of
any kind.
"When the armature c (Fig.V.) is mechanically set in vibration the armature h responds not only in pitch but in loudness.
Thus when c vibrates with little amplitude, a very soft musical
note proceeds from h,and when o vibrates forcibly the amplitude of vibration of I is considerably increased, and the sound
becomes louder. So if A and B (Fig. VI.) are sounded simultaneonsly (A loudly and B softly) the instruments A', A' repeat
-loudly the signals of A, and the instruments B 1,B' repeat gently those of B.
"One of the ways in which the armature (o) Fig. VI. may
be set in vibration has been stated above to be by wind.
Another mode is shown [by] in Fig. VII. [which] WHEREBY

motion can be imparted to the armature by means of the
human voice, or by the tones of a musical instrument.
"The armature c (Fig VII.) is fastened loosely by one extremity to the uncovered pole (d) of the electro-magnet (b),
and its other extremity is attached to the centre of a stretched
membrane (a). A cone A is used to converge sound vibrations
upon the membrane. When a loud sound is uttered in the
cone the membrane (a) is set in vibration; the armature 0 is
forced to partake of the motioa, and thus electrical undulations
are caused upon the circuit E, b,ef, g. These undulations are
similar in form to the air vibrations caused by the sound, -

plays on an instrument any tune, as 'Yankee Doodle,' or
'Hail Columbia,' it will be heard and distinguished plainly
at the other end. This invention may, in its present state,
have no direct practical application, but be a mere scientific,
although highly interesting curiosity; but who can say that it
does not contain'the germ of a new method of working the
telegraph, or some other useful practical purpose?
" The telephone is not the result of an accidental discovery,
but of a thorough study of the laws of electro-magnetism'and
of sound. It is founded on the fact that the difference in
pitch of different tones is caused by different velocities of
vibrations of the elastic sounding body; which vibrations are
transmitted to and by the air with exactly the same velocity,
and from the air may be communicated to -E properly stretched
membrane, like a piece of bladder or very thin sheet of indiarubber, stretched like a drum head, which these alsa will
vibrate with exactly the same velocity as the air and the
original sounding body, be it the human voice, organ pipe,
string or any musical instrument. If, now, at-the centre of
this little drum head there be attached a small disk of some
metal not easily burned by electric currents, -i. or instance,
platinum,-while at the same time a platinum point may, by
means of a screw, be so adjusted as to come vry Itearly, in
contact with this small platinum disk, it is clear hat, when
the membrane is put in vibration, a succession of contacts
between the disk and point will be produced, 6f-.which the
number in each second will exactly correspond wit,- the number of vibrations in each second of the- sounding body or
the tone produced by it. That part of the, appaiatu whh
serves to send off the tune or melody is represented in the
illustration. It consists simply of a square wooden -box,
provided at the side with a kind of mouthpiece simiax to
that of a speaking-tube, and at the top with an opening, over
which the membrane just mentioned has been stretched. The
small piece of platinum attached to the centre of this little
drum head is, by means of a very flexible strip of some metal that conducts well, attached to one pole df -the ga.vaMc
battery, of which only one cup is represented in the-figure,
VOL. CxxvI-7

OCTOBER TERM, '1887.
Statement 6f the Case.

although for a long wire several cups will, of course, be
required. The reason why this connection- near the platinum
.disk is a flat, thin and flexible strip is, that any rigidity would
interfere with the freedom of vibration of the membrane to,
which it is attached. The point coming in contact with this
smll vibrating disk is connected with the ground wire, the
other pole of the battery with the air wire or submarine cable.
It is clear, from this explanation, that at every contact of the,
platinum poifit a wave of electricity will be sent over the wire,
and as many waves in a second as there are contacts; and as.
there are as many contacts as there are vibrations in every
second, the number of electric waves will be always exactly
equal to the number of vibrations corresponding with the
pitch of each tone, be it fifty, one hundred, two hundred or
five hundred iVi every second.
"1The instrument in which this succession of waves is made
audible at. the other end of the telegraph wire is founded on
the fact - first investigated by Professor Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute at Washington-that iron bars, when becoming magnetic by means of electric currents passing around
them, become slightly elongated, and at the interruption of
the current are at once restored to their original length.
It is represented in the cut, and consists of an elongated
wooden box, of which the top is made of thin pine wood,
similar to the sounding-board of a stringed musical instrument,,
to which are attached two -bridges carrying long pieces of'
moderately thick and very soft iron wire, which, for nearly
their whole length, are surrounded by a coil similar to the coil
of the electro-magnets used in telegraphing. One end of this.
coil is attached to the telegraph wire, the other to the ground
wire, as represented in the figure. At every instant that a
contact is established at the station where the sound is produced, and a current wave thus transmitted, these wires will
.become magnetic, and consequently elongated; and they will
be shortened again at every interruption of the current. And
as these currents and interruptions succeed each other with
the same velocity as the sound vibrations, the elongations and
shortenings of the magnetized iron wires will succeed each

TELEPHONE CASES.
Statement of the Case.

other with exactly the same velocity, and consequently they
will be thrown into a state of longitudinal vibrations corresponding with the original musical tone, which vibrations will
then be communicated to the sounding-board in exactly the
same manner as is the case with the vibrations of the strings
in all stringed instruments, thus becoming more audible at the
receiving station.
"It is clear, from the foregoing explanations, that no quality
of tone can be transmitted. -Much less can articulate words
be sent, notwithstanding the enthusiastic prediction of some
persons, who, when they first beheld this apparatus in operation, exclaimed that now we would talk directly through the
wire. It is from its nature able to transmit only pitch and
rhythm,- consequently melody, and nothing more. No harmony nor different degrees of strength or other qualities of
tone can be transmitted. The receiving instrument, in fact,'
sings the melodies transmitted, as it were, with its own voice,
resembling the humming of an insect, iegardless of the quality
of the tone which produces the original tune at-the other end
of the wire.
"This instrument is a German invention, andI was first
exhibited in New York, at the Polytechnic Association of the
American Institute, by iDr. Van der Weyde. The original
sounds were produced at the farther extremity of the large
building (the Cooper Institute), totally out of hearing of the
Association; and the receiving instrument, standing on the
table of the lecture-room, produced with its own rather nasal
twang the different tunes sung at the other end of the line;
rather weakly, it is true, because of the weak battery used,
but very distinctly and correctly."

esting for the readers of this paper to obtain some information
in regard to the invention of the telephone, by Reuss. As
mentioned in the article above referred to, Page and Henry
observed that, by rapid magnetization and demagnetization,
iron could be put into vibrations isochronic with the interruptions of the current; and later, Marian experimented extensively in this direction, while Wertheim made a thorough investigation of the subject, which induced Reuss, of Friedrichsdorf,
near Hamburg, Germany, to apply this principle to the transmission of musical tones and melodies by telegraph; and he
contrived an apparatus'which we represent in the engravings.

"The telephone of Reuss consists of two parts, the transmitting and the receiving instrument. Fig. I. represents the
former, and is placed at the locality where the music is produced Fig. II., the latter, is placed at the station where the
music is to be heard, which may be at a distance of one hundred, two hundred, or more miles, in fact, as far as the battery
used can carry the current, while the two instruments are connected with the battery and the telegraph wire in the usual
manner. One pole of the battery is connected with the ground
plate, the other with the screw, marked 2 of Fig. I., and thence
over a thin copper strip %,with a platinum disk, o, attached to
the centre of the membrane stretched in the )arge top opening of the hollow and empty box, K, intended to receive and
strengthen the vibrations of the air, produced by singing before the funnel-shaped short tube attached to the opening in

TELEPHONE CASES.
Statement of the Case.

T. Over the platinum disk, c, attached to the elastic membrane, is a platinum point attached to the arms b o and b K,
while a set screw brings this point in slight contact with the
platinum disk mentioned. A part of the box is represented as
broken and removed in order to show the internal construction. The strip a b a is connected with the end s, of the switch
t s,and the screw connection, 1, at the lower right-hand corner,
and also through the telegraph wire, to the instrument Fig.
II., at the receiving station, which may be situated at a distance of many miles. Here the current enters by the screw
connection, 3, and passes through the spiral g,surrounding the

soft iron wire, dd, of the thickness of a knitting needle, and
leaves the apparatus at the screw connection, 4, whence it
obtains access to the ground plate, and so passes'through the
earth back to the battery. The spiral and iron wire dd is
supported on a hollow box, B, of thin board; while a cover
D, of the same material is placed on top, all intended to
strengthen the sound produced by the vibrations which the
interruptioL of the curkent caused in the iron wire, d d, so as
to make these vibrations more audible by giving a large vibratory surface, in the same way that the sounding board of' a
piano-forte strengthens the vibrations of the air, caused by the
strings, and makes a very weak sound quite powerful.
"If a flute be played before. the opening T, or if a voice be
singing there, the vibration of the air inside the box K causes
the membrane m to vibrate synchronically, and this causes the
platinum disk o to move up and down with corresponding frequency. At every downward motion the contact of this disk
with the platinum point, under b, is broken, and therefore the
current is interrupted as rapidly as the vibrations occur. Let,
for instance, the note C be sounded; this note makes sixtyfour full vibrations in a second, and we have, therefore, sixtyfour interruptions of the electric current, which interruption
will at once be transmitted through the telegraph lines to the
receiving instrument, and put the bar d d into exactly similar
vibrations, making the very same tone, C, audible; and so' on
for all other rates of vibration. It is clear that in this way
not only the rhythm of music can be transmitted (and this can

be done by the ordinary telegraph), but thevery tones, as well
as the-relative durations and the rests between them, can thus
be sent, making a full and complete melody. The switch ts,
Fig. I., is intended, in connection with a similar one in Fig. II.,
to communicate between the stations, with the help of the electro-magnet E, to ascertain if station, Fig. II., is ready to receive
the melodies; then it 'gives the signal, by manipulating the
switch, which is received by the attraction of the armature A,
the latter arrangement being a simple Morse apparatus attached to the telephone.
"Professor Heisler, in his Zeh'buck der technischen P hysik
(3d edition, Vienna, 1866), says, in regard to this instrument:
'The telephone is still in its infancy; however, by the use of
batteries of proper strength, it already transmits not only single musical tones, but even the most intricate melodies, sung
at one end of the line, to the other, situated at a great distance, and makes them perceptible there with all the desirable
distinctness.' After reading this account in 1868, I had two
such telephones constructed, and exhibited them at the meeting of the Polytechnic Club of the American Institute. The
original sounds were produced at the further extremity of the
large building (the Cooper Institute), totally out of hearing of
the Association, and the receiving instrument, standing on the
table in the lecture-room, produced (with a peculiar and rather
nasal twang) the different tunes sung into the box K, at the
other end of the line; not powerfully, it is true, but very distinctly and correctly. In the succeeding summer I improved
the form of the box K, so as to produce amore powerful vibration of the membrane, by means of reflections effected by curving the sides; I also improved the receiving instrument by introducing several iron wires in the coil, so as to produce a
stronger vibration. I submitted these, with some other improvements, to the meeting of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, and on that occasion (now seven
years ago) expressed the opinion that the instrument contained
the germ of a new method of working the electric telegraph,
and would undoubtedly lead to further improvements in this
branch of science, needing only that a competent person give

it his undivided attention, so as to develop out of it all that it
is evidently capable of producing.
"Before leaving this subject, I wish to draw special attention to the fact that the merits of the invention consist chiefly
in the absence of musical instruments, tuning forks, or their
.equivalents for producing the tones; any instrument will do
flute, violin, human voice, &c. If the aerial vibrations are
only conducted into the box, Fig. 1, the apparatus will send

Statement of the Case.

"The object of my invention is to provide a means for
transmitting articulate sounds from one place to another
through the medium of electricity, and it consists in the combination with an .electrical battery circuit wires, armature,
magnet and circuit-breaker, of a transmitting and a receiving
membrane or sounding apparatus, so constructed as to vibrate
in accord with the vibrations of articulate sound, and so
arranged relative to the magnet and circuit-breaker that the,
vibrations of the transmitting membrane or apparatus produced by articulate sounds, are transmitted by the electrical
current to the nceiving membrane or apparatus, and so as to
cause a like vibration of the receiving membrane or apparatus,
and [cause] it to reproduce the articulate sounds transmitted
from and by the transmitting membrane or apparatus. Mry
invention also consists in the novel construction of the circuitbreaker, as is hereinafter more fully described.
"In the drawing A represents the transmitting membrane
or apparatus, composed of vellum, or any suitable material
that is sensitive to the vibrations of sound, which is stretched
upon a metal hoop or band a, permanently attached to the
bed A', and is so arranged upon the hoop or band as to admit
of being tightened or loosened at will. 0 0 are metal plates
attached to the upper surface of the membrane A, at its
centre, and are insulated from each other. D is a metal bolt
permanently attached at its lower end to said membrane A,
centrally between the plates C C, and is insulated from them.
D' is the circuit-breaker, which consists of an arched-shaped
piece of metal loosely secured at its centre upon the bolt D,
and is bent upward at each end, and from the membrane A,
as shown in Fig. 3, so as to form depending V-shaped points
adapted to rest upon the respective plates 0 0. The circuitbreaker D' is so fitted upon the bolt D as to admit of a free
and easy ascending and descending movement, the limit of its
ascending movement being determined by its contact with the
nut E on the bolt, and the descending movement being limited
by its contact with the plates 0 0. F is the receiving or
sounding membrane, which is also composed of vellum or any
suitable material that is sensitive to the vibration of sound,

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Statement of the Case.

-and is stretched upon a metal hook or band a" secured to the
side frame G, of the receiving or sounding apparatus, as shown
in Fig. 1, and is so adjusted as to admit of being loosened or
tightened as may be required.
"G' is the magnet surrounded by a helix of insulated wire,
and connected to the instrument immediately in front of the
membrane F; and at a point near its centre. H is the arma,
ture plate permanently attached to the membrane F, between
it and the magnet, as shown in Fig. 1.
"To each of the plates C 0 is connected a wire J, one of
which is connected with the battery K, and the other with
the ground wire L. To each- of the poles of the magnet is
connected a wire M, one of which is connected with the bat-.
tery K, and the other with the ground wire, as shown in
Fig. 1.
"The operation of my said teleloge is as follows: the transmitting membrane A, being sensitive to the vibrations of
articulate sounds produced thereon, is caused to vibrate in
sympathy therewith, thereby imparting an upward movement
to the circuit-breaker at each vibration, and disconnecting it
from the plates 0 0, and alternately breaking and closing the
circuit, when the intermittent current alternately magnetizes
and demagnetizes the magnet G', attracting the armature H,
and causes it and the membrane F to vibrate simultaneously
with the vibrations of the transmitting membrane A, and in
accord therewith, and so that the said membrane F reproduces the articulate sounds transmitted from qnd by the
membrane A.
"I do not limit myself to the construction and arrangement
of the circuit-breaker D', as shown and described, as other
means may be employed, as for example, only one of the
plates C may be attached to the membrane, and the other
made either in the form of a plate or needle and attached
direct to the connecting wire, and adjusted to rest upon the
plate, so as to break the connection by the vibrations of the
membrane, which will accomplish the same result. It will be
observed that each end of the circuit-breaker D' is bent upward
from the membrane, the object being to prevent local attrac-

tion and render its action more sensitive to the lighter vibrations of the membrane. The articulate sounds may be taken
direct from the magnet, or through any substance or material
sufficiently sensitive to the vibrations of sound to reproduce
them by contact with the magnet.
I"Having thus described my invention, what I blaim as new,
and desire to secure by letters patent, is:
"1. The combination with the battery, circuit wires, magmet,
armature and circuit-breaker, of the transmitting membrane
A, and receiving membrane F, substantially as and for the
purpose specified.
1"2. The combination with the plates 0 0, of the circuitbreaker DI, whereby the circuit is alternately opened and
closed by the vibrations of the membrane.A, substantially as
specified.
"3.The combination of the bolt D and adjusting nut E, of
the circuit-breaker D, substantially as and for the purpose
specified."
There were two Varley patents. The United States patent,
dated June 2, 1868, set forth the object of the invention thus:
"The objects of my invention are to cut off the disturbance
arising from earth-currents, to obtain a high speed of signaling through long circuits, and, should the conductor become
partially exposed, to preserve it from being eaten away by
electrolytic action"; and made the following claims:
"Having now described my invention, and the manner in
which the same is or may be carried into effect, what I claim,
and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is " 1. In so arranging telegraphic apparatus as to work by
the variation of the increment and decrement of electric
potential, and not by the direct action of the electric current
itself, as and for the purposes set forth.
"2. The use of an induction-coil at the receiving end of the
cable, one of its wires being connected between the cable and
the ground, and the other or secondary wire connected with
the receiving-instrument, as and for the purposes set forth.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Statement of the Case.

"3. The use of & condenser or condensers between the
receiving end of the cable and the earth, with or without
resistance-coils between the cable and the earth, as and for
the purposes set forth.
"4. The use of a condenser at the sending end of the
cable, with or without resistance-coils connecting its two
armatures, as and for the purposes set forth.
"5. The use of a condenser at each end of the cable, the
cable being connected with the ground through a resistancecoil and a battery, so as to keep the cable always negatively
electrified, as and for the purposes set forth."
The object of the British patent, dated October 8, 1870, was
said to be "the increase of the transmitting power of telegraph circuits by enabling more than one operator to signal
independent messages at the same time upon one and the
same wire to and from independent stations"; and the claims
were as follows:
"Having thus described the nature of my invention and the
manner of performing the same, I would have it understood
that I claim the construction of electric telegraphs in such
manner that current signals and wave signals may be simultaneously transmitted through the same line wire, and may be
rendered sensible at the receiving station by separate instruments, the one sensitive to currents of appreciable duration,
and the other to electric waves or vibrations.
"I also claim the construction of electric telegraphs with,
at the transmitting station, an instrument capable of originating in the line wire a succession of rapid and regular electric
waves, and at the receiving station a strained wire, a tongue,
or such like instrument adjusted to vibrate in unison with the
electric waves, and, being magnetized by them, oscillating to
and from the pole or poles of a magnet in its vicinity.
q I also claim, in the censtruction of electric telegraphs, the
dividing a conducting wire into sections by instruments which
I have called 'echocyme,' which allow current signals to pass
freely but stop wave signals, so that, whilst the wire is being
used as a whole for through signals, the sections into which it
is divided may each or all be employed for the transmission of
local messages.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Statement of the Case.

"I also claim the construction of electric telegraphs with, at
the transmitting station, an instrument capable of originating
in the line wire a succession of rapid and regular electric
waves, and at the receiving station a c6ndenser consisting of"
thin sheets capable of being agitated by such waves.
"I also claim the construction of electric telegraphs with,
at the transmitting station, an instrument capable of originating in the line wire a succession of rapid and regular electric
waves, and at the receiving station an instrument which, on
receiving such waves, delivers a current of electricity to an
indicating or receiving instrument suitable to be worked with
ordinary current signals.
"I also claim the combination with Dr. Gintl and Frischen's
double speaking apparatus of a hollow helix connected between the receiving instrument and the line wire, such helix
having rods or pieces of iron inserted into it."

The People's Telephone Company claimed as assignees of
Drawbaugh's inventions and of his rights, and in their awer
,
made the following averments respecting them.
"11. Further answering, this defendant says, that Daniel
Drawbaugh, of Eberly's Mills, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, was and is the original and first inventor and discoverer
of the art of communicating articulate speech between distant
places by voltaic and magneto electricity, and of the construction and operation of machines and instruments for carrying
such art into practice; that long prior to the alleged inventions by said Alexander Graham Bell, and long prior to the
respective inventions of said Gray and said Edison, said Daniel
Drawbaugh, then and now residing at said Eberly's Mills,
constructed and operated practical working electric speaking
telephones at said Eberly's Mills, and exhibited their successful
operation to a great number of other persons resident in his
vicinity and elsewhere; that the said electric speaking telephones, so constructed and successfully and practically used
by him, as aforesaid, contained all the material and substantial
parts and inventions patented in said patents No. 174,465 and

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Statement of the Case.

No. 186,87, grantea to said Bell; and also cont tined other
important and valuable inventions in electric and magneto
telephony, and were fully capable of transmitting, and were
actually used for transmitting, articulate vocal sounds and
speech between distant points by means of electric currents;
that some of the original machines and instruments invented,
made, used, and exhibited to many others, long prior to the
said alleged inventions of said Bell, or either of them, are still
in existence, and capable of successful practical use, and are
identified by a large number of persons who personally tested
and used, and knew of their practical operation and use, in
the years 1870, 1871, 1872, 1873, 1874, and both subsequently
and prior thereto; that certainly more than fifty, and probably
not less than one hundred persons, or even more, were cognizant of said Drawbaugh's invention and use of said telephones,
and of his claim to be the original -and first inventor thereof,
prior to the alleged inventions of said Bell, or either of them;
that said Drawbaugh, for more than ten years prior to the
year 1880, was miserably.poor, in debt, with a large and helpless family dependent upon his daily labor for support, and
was, from such cause alone, utterly unable to patent his said
invention, or caveat it, or manufacture and introduce it upon
the market; that said Drawbaugh never abandoned his said
invention, nor acknowledged the claims of any other person
or persons thereto, but always persisted in his claims to it, and
intended to patent it as soon as he could procure the necessary
pecuniary means therefor;- that said Drawbaugh never acquiesced in the public use of said Bell, Gray, Edison, Blake, or
other telephones, nor in the claims of the 'alleged inventors
thereof, nor gave his consent to such use; and that, in view
of th6 facts aforesaid, neither said Bell nor any other person
or persons whatever, except the said Drawbaugh, can now obtain a valid patent therefor, nor are the patents granted to
said Bell as aforesaid, or either of them, of any validity or
value whatever.
"12. Further answering, this defendant says, that the said
Daniel Drawbaugh, after making, testing, using, and extensively exhibiting his invention to. others, and allowing them

.TELEPIONE CASES.
Statement of the Case.

experimentally to personally test and ascertain its successful
practical operation and utility, as aforesaid, and after the full
and repeated demonstration of its successful working, as aforesaid, conceived that its range anal capacity of usefulness to the
public might be very greatly enlarged; that many improvements of great value might be made and added to it which,
without departing from its principle, might increase its value
to himself and to the public, and therefore set himself at work
to discover and invent such improvements; that he discovered
and- invented some of said additional improvements prior to!
any alleged invention by the said Bell; and that,, notwithstanding his embarrassed and impoverished pecuniary condition, and' his utter want of proper mechanical tools, materials, and appliances to conduct such work, he labored with all
reasonable diligence to perfect and adapt his said improvements, and did finally, in due exercise* of such reasonable
diligence, perfect and adapt the same; and that, in so far as
the said Bell has incorporated such improvements in his said
two patents, or either of them, he, the said Bell, has surreptitiously and unjustly obtained a patent or patents for that
which was in fact first invented by said Drawbaugh, who was
using reasonable diligence in perfecting and adapting the
same; and therefore the patent or patents of the said Bell
therefor is, or are, invalid and void.
"13. Further answering, this defendant says that it has, by
purchase, and for a valuable consideration, acquired the right,
title, and interest of said Daniel Drawbaugh in and to all his
said inventions, discoveries, and improvements in electric
speaking telephones, and has full right, at law and in equity,
to make, sell, and use electric speaking telephones, embodying
the inventions, discoveries, and improvements of said Drawbaugh, without interference from or molestation by said Bell'
or his assigns, and .without liability, to these complainants
therefor.
"14. Further answering, this defendant says that it has, in
good faith, and relying upon its legal rights aforesaid, caused
applications to be made and filed in the Patent Office for Letters Patent upon the inventions of the said Daniel Drawbaugh,

'112

Statement of the Case.

with the intention 9 f procuring interference proceedings to be
instituted, in accordance with the statute, against the patents
of said Bell, and the pending applications of said Gray, Edison,
and others, in order that said Drawbaugh may be adjudged
by the Commissioner of Patents to be, as he rightfully is, the
original and first'inventor of the electric speaking telephone,
and may be adjudged entitled to receive a patent or patents
therefor.
"15. This defendant, further answering, denies all and all
manner of unlawful conspiracy and confederacy with other
persons and parties, as charged in the complainants' bill of complaint; denies all knowledge of the alleged newspaper publications referred to in said bill, and calls for due proof of said
alleged publications, if the complainants shall be advised that
they are of any materiality to this suit, which this defendant
denies; and denies all the allegations of the complainants' bill
as to the said Drawbaugh invention, and, particularly, the allgations that said Drawbaugh's invention was a mere experiment, was incomplete, imperfect, unfruitful, and that knowledge of it was withheld from the public, except so far as
disclosed by said alleged newspaper publications in said bill
mentioned and set forth. And this defendant charges that
the contrary of all said allegations is true; that this defendant has done no unlawful or inequitable act in the premises;
that it is not responsible for said alleged newspaper publications; that said Drawbaugh's original invention was complete,
successful, operative, and practically and successfully operated,
and reduced to practice as a ' Speaking Telephone' on many
occasions, in the presence and hearing of many other persons,
and knowledge thereof was freely communicated to the public
by said Drawbaugh; and that said Drawbailgh's improvements,
additional to his said original invention, were complete, successful, and practical inventions; that all of his said inventions
were fully reduced to practice and communicated to others;
but that said other persons, having knowledge of his legal and
equitable. right in and to his said inventions, and respecting
and acquiescing in the same, desisted and refrained from making and using his said inventions, and acquiesced in his right

'thereto, and never did, so far as this defendant is inf6rmed
and believes, any act to impair his said rights or which would
prevent the grant of a good and valid patent or patents to
him, the said Daniel Drawbaugh, or his assigns, for any or all
of his said inventions.
โขQt16. This defendant, further answering, says that so far and
-to such extent as electric speaking telephones were put on sale
and into public use in this country, by others than said Drawbaugh, prior to said Drawbaugh's application for a patent
thereon, as aforesaid, such specific machines and instruments,
so put on sale and into public use, were not the specific machines .and instruments invented by said Dra*baugh, as aforesaid, but were machines and instruments invented by others,
subsequently to the original and first invention of the electric
speaking telephone by said Drawbaugh, and subsequently to
the invention of his said improvements thereon, as aforesaid;
and that, as this defendant is informed and believes, such machines and instruments were so put on sale and into public
use, not from or by reason of any information derived from or
through said Drawbaugh, but by an independent invention, or
independent inventions thereof, by others subsequently to said
Drawbaugh's original and first invention as aforesaid, and
while said Drawbaugh was unable, by reason of his poverty
and other controlling circumstances, as above set forth, to patent his said inventions; and that such public use and sales
were without the consent, allowance, or acquiescence of said
Daniel Drawbaugh.
"And this defendant, as advised by its counsel, further answers and says, that the alleged invention of the electric speaking telephone by said Bell, subsequently to said Drawbaugh's
invention thereof, as aforesaid, conferred upon said Bell, or his
assigns, no legal right to a patent or patents thereon, nor did
it impair the legal right of said Drawbaugh to a patent or patents upon his own prior inventions ; and that the alleged public use and sales of such subsequently invented telephones,
without said Drawbaugh's consent, alowance, or acquiescence
as aforesaid, and by reason of knowledge and information of
their construction and operation, not derived from or through

said Drawbaugh, have in law no effect to forfeit or bar said
Drawbaugh's right to the exclusive use of his own prior invention, nor to prevent him or his assigns from obtaining a valid
patent or valid patents thereon."
It was claimed by the People's Company, that Drawbaugh's
inventions and the inventions covered by Bell's patents were
for substantially the same thing. The main issues in this respect argued by counsel were issues of fact -whether Drawbaugh's instruments were made prior to Bell's discovery, and
were practically operative, and whether the Drawbaugh witnesses to these points were to be believed. The record contains a great mass of testimony on these issues. Much of this
is referred to in detail by the counsel on each side and by the
court. It is not practicable to report it further than they have
regarded it as material, and presented it in quotations and
references.
There was before the court in the Drawbaugh case a book
containing a series of plates, (with references and notes written
upon them,) marked respectively from "A" to "Q," both
inclusive. It was claimed on his behalf that these plates
represented his invention at various stages of its development.
The claim was made in the following language by his counsel:
"The story of Drawbaugh, and of the record, overwhelmingly corroborated by the witnesses for the defence, is as
follows:
"Early conception and experiments with the continuous current, 1862, 1866; and 1867.
"Teacup transmitter and receiver, 1866, and 1867.
"Tumbler and tin cup and mustard can (' F' and ' B '), 1867
and 1869.
"Improvement upon 'B ' (' C '), 1869, 1870.
"Further improvement upon ' C ' and the more perfect magneto instrument 'I,' 1870, 1871.
"1Mouthpiece changed to centre, and adjusting screw inserted (Exhibit ' A'), 1874.
"' D' and IE' perfectly adjusted and finished magneto instruments, January and February, 1875.
"'I.) 'M,' 'G,' and '0' from February, 1875, to August,
1876.

The following are such of these plates, to which the counsel
assigned a date prior to Bell's patent of March 7, 1876, as are
deemed to be necessary for a proper understanding of the arguments of counsel, and of the opinion of the court, upon this
point. They are arranged in the order of the dates in which
Drawbaugh was said to have constructed the instrument which
they represent.

Statement of the Case.

Dolbear's answer also made the following allegations.
"12. These defendants have never been concerned in the
manufacture or sale of telephones embracing the inventions or
either of them, or any substantial or material parts of either
of them, described in either of the patents mentioned in the
bill of complaint; but they admit the manufacture and use of
telephones invented by the defendant Dolbear and described
in his Letters Patent No, 239,742, dated April 5, 1881; No.
240,578, dated April 26, 1881; and aver that they have full
right to manufacture, use, and sell such telephones, and that
they are radically different in all substantial respects from anyinvention described in either of the said Bell patents. The
transmitter used in the Dolbear telephone is in all material
respects identical with the Reiss-Wright transmitter. It is a
Reiss transmitter in a circuit of small resistance, having a helix
as a part of it, with the transmitting core in that helix;
the line is an open circuit, and is the first open circuit ever
used for any practical purpose, and it was wholly unknown
until Dolbear's discovery that such a line was capable of any
practical use. The receiver is wholly new, wholly unlike any
prior instrument, and operates upon a principle never before
applied in any of the useful arts. The method invented by
Dolbear, and the only method practised when his apparatus is
used, is precisely the same as the Reiss-Wright method so far
as concerns the use of the energy of the sound-waves to vary
the electric current in a circuit of small resistance, and the use
of the current so varied to vary the magnetic energy of the'
transmitter core; but is wholly new with Dolbear in all other
respects, for the magnetic variations of the transmitter core
must be converted into electric variations of many times
greater electro-motive force than any ever before utilized for
any practical purpose, and must be generated in a line whose
resistance is practically infinite, and must be transformed
directly into sound-waves. Dolbear's method is his own discovery and invention, is radically different from all other
methods of transmitting sounds, except as to its first step,
which is th6 same as that of the Reiss-Wright method, and is
of the highest value and importance, inasmuch as it remedies

fully some very serious faults in the Bell method, which was
the best known before Dolbear's discovery."

APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING SOUND BY ELECTRICITY.
Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. 239,742, dated April 5,
1881. Application filed October 11, 1880. (Model.)

[To l. whom it 'may coner:
Be it known that I, Amos E. DoLBEAx, of Somerville, in
the County of IMiddlesex and State of M assachusetts, have
invented a new Apparatus for Transmitting Sound by Electricity, of which the following is a full, clear, concise, and
exact description, reference being had to the accompanying
drawings, making a part hereof, in whichFigures 1 and 2 are two views of the best form of apparatus
for practising my invention. Fig. 3 is a cross-section, enlarged,
of the receiver shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 is a plan of one of
the plates. Fig. 5 is a diagram illustrating the system.
My invention consists, manly, in a new mode of transmitting articulate and other sounds by an open circuit.
It also consists in new apparatus for this purpose.
My receiver is based upon the well-known principle that one
terminal of an open circuit will attract the other terminal
when both are charged; and my invention consists, mainly, in
the arrangement of the enlarged terminal of the secondary
coil of an induction-coil so that it will be vibrated toward and
from the other terminal by variations in the electric state of
the coil, and in such a manner as to reproduce sound-vibrations of all qualities, including articulate speech, when the
primary circuit of the induction-coil contains a suitable transmitter.
Another feature of my invention relates to the system of

connecting two or more receivers and two or more transmitters for practical use; and it consists in the combination of
two induction-coils, two receivers, and two transmitters in a
novel manner, fully described below.
The best form of my receiver is that shown in elevation in
Fig. 1, and in cross-section in Fig. 3.
In Fig. 3 the case of the receiver A is shown as made up of
three pieces-a back piece, P, an ear-piece, Y,and an annular

connecting-piece, t, for connecting the pieces r' and s together.
a are thin elastic plates, preferably of iron, forming terminals of the secondary coil of an induction-coil. These
plates are securely fastened about the edges and brought very
near to each other, but not in contact, a thin annulus, d, lying
between them. This is best effected by forming a thin flange,
d,on the interior of the connecting-piece, t, and placing the
terminals a b on opposite sides of this flange. The ear-piece s
of the case holds the terminal a in place with the proper tension around the edge to insure mass vibrations of that terminal. The terminal b is (held in place by the back piece, r, of
the case. Each of the plates a and b is formed with a small'
tongue, a2, (see Fig. 4,) with which the binding-screws are connected, as shown.
As the section-plane in Fig. 3 will pass through but one of
the binding-screws, (that for the wire a',) the receiver is shown
broken away at w, in order to show the binding-screw for the
wire '. Both are shown in Fig. 1. One of the binding-screws
connects with plate a, the other with plate b. By the use of
the tongues an even pressure around the whole edge of' the
plate is possible.
The adjustment of the instrument is effected by the screw
A'; and this screw, by contact upon the back plate, b, prevents
any vibrations of that plate which interfere with the proper
vibrations of the front plate, a.
My system requires electricity of a very high electro-motive
force, and this is best obtained by means of a secondary coil
with a high resistance, the best results having been obtaiied
fronT four or five thousand ohms of No. 36 copper wire.
Transmitters such as are in common use will answer with

my, receiver; but the best form of transmitter is that shown
in the drawings, (which-is not here described, as it forms the
suliject of an application for a patent filed by me May 31,
1880.)
The main advantages of my new system over all others
known to me are, that it- is not appreciably affected by
ordinary induced currents on the line, it has no magnet to
deteriorate, the adjustment is more simple and is not affected
by barometric and hygrometric variations, and it lacks the
fine-wire helix of the ccpmmon receiver, which is very liable to
get out of repair. It is very efficient also on very long lines.
* The best system for the practical use of my invention is
illustrated in the diagram, Fig. 5, and the best form of apparatus is that shown in Figs. I and 2. In these figures, A
represents the receivers, B the transmitters, D the batteries, F
the induction-coils, and G switches.
The transmitter B and battery D are in the circuit with the
primary coil of the induction coil 2F, and this circuit is completed, when the transmitter is to be used, by throwing over
the member g of switch G until it makes contact with the
member g', thereby completing the battery-circuit through
the transmitter and primary coil. The electricity induced in
the secondary coil affects the plates in the distant receiver by
means of that branch of wire F' which extends from one end
of the secondary coil to member g of switch G, members g
and g2 of switch G, the line-wire 1, which is a continuation of
member g2 of switch G, wire 12, which is a branch of linewire 1, receiver-wires a' b', wire m2, members g g3 of switch 0-,
wire 92, to earth, thus cutting out the receiver at the sendingstation (on the left of the diagram) and the secondary coil on
the right of the diagram.
When the sending-station is at the right of the diagram,
the switch G at the right will be arranged as is the switch G
at the left, and the receiver at the left is elecirified. by means
of wire 1', receiver-wires a' 1', (at the left of the diagram,)

brought in contact with stop g' it will also be in contact with
spring g2, and when spring g is in contact with stop g3 it will
be out of contact with both spring g2 and stop g'. One end
of the secondary coil on the left of the diagram is connected
with spring g on the left of diagram by means of one branch
of wire 2n! and with receiver-wire b' on the left of diagram by
means of the other branch of wire in', and one end of the
secondary coil on the right of the diagram is connected with
spring g on the right of diagram by means of one branch of
wire m2, and with receiver-wire Y9 on the right of the diagram
by means of the other branch of wire m2 .
I am aware of the apparatus mentioned as used by Dr.
Wright in "1Ferguson's Electricity," published by William and
Robert Chambers, of London and Edinburgh, in 1867, pages
258 and 259, in which two sheets of paper silvered on one side
were placed back to back and connected with the two ends of
an induction-coil, the primary circuit of which contained a
Reis transmitter; and I disclaim that apparatus. My receiver
differs from it in that the sounds transmitted are reproduced,
by the mass vibrations of one of the terminals, while in the
Wright receiving apparatus the sound produced was mainly,
if not altogether, due to molecular motion, and not to mass
vibrations. Moreover, Wright's sheets of silvered paper were
so arranged that each would damp any mass vibrations of the
other; and in his apparatus any slight mass vibrations, even if
not wholly damped, would be necessarily so irregular as to be
worthless as a means of reproducing sounds. The fact, also,
that the mass vibrations of each sheet damped those of the
other sheet would make all the mass vibrations worthless for
this purpose.
I am also aware of English Patents No. 4934: of 1877 and
No. 2396 of 18,78, and disclaim all therein shown.
What I claim as my invention is 1. The receiver above described, consisting of the plates a b,
mounted in case r s t, and separated by the annulus d, in combination with induction-coil F, substantially as described.
2. In combination, two induction-coils, the primary of each

MODE OF TRANSMITTING SOUND BY ELECTRICITY.
Specificbtion forming part of Letters Patent No. 240,578,.dated April 26,
1881. Application filed February 24, 1881. (Model.)

To all whom it may concern :
Be it known that I, Amos E. DOL.BEA, ot Somerville, in the
county of Middlesex and State of Massachusetts, have invented
a new Mode of Transmitting Sounds by Electricity, of which
the following is a full, clear, concise, and exact description,
reference being had to the accompanying drawings, making a
part hereof.

My invention consists, mainly, in a new mode of transmitting
articulate and other sounds by an open circuit.
It also consists in new apparatus for this purpose.
My receiver is based upon the discovery that one terminal
of an open circuit will attract and be attracted by a neighboring body when the terminal is charged.
Figure 1 shows two modifications of my receiver, in section,
connected in circuit with a transmitter and inductioncoil.
Fig. 2 shows another modification of my receiver.
Three forms of my receiver are shown in the drawings. In
each the casing is formed of three pieces, r being the backpiece, s the ear-piece, and t the connecting-piece which connects r and s together. The plate a of receiver I is a thin

elastic disk, preferably of iron, the vibrations of which reproduce the sound which causes the diaphragm of the transmitter
T to vibrate, T representing a transmitter of suitable construction, the form preferred being that shown in my application
for a patent filed May 31, 1880, the transmitter T and the
battery B being in circuit with the primary coil, as will be
clear without further description.
In receiver I the plate a .is one terminal of the secondary
coil F, and any change in the electrical state of coil F varies
the potential of this plate a in receiver I and causes it to
attract plate b, which is mounted close to, but not in contact
with, plate a; but as plate b in receiver I is so mounted that
it cannot vibrate, plate a will vibrate as its potential varies.
In receiver I the plate b and back-piece r and adjusting-screw
u are all of metal.
It will be seen that neither the plate b nor back-piece r nor
screw u of receiver I is connected to the coil F, but that only
one terminal of coil F - viz., plate a - forms any part of the
receiver I. The plate b may be made in one piece with backpiece r, but for purposes of adjustment is best made as
shown.
The force of the attraction between the charged terminal a
and any neighboring body is slight, unless the neighboring
body be many times larger than the terminal and itself capable of being readily electrified, and for this reason, when the
neighboring body is a plate, (as it is best made for purpose of
adjustment,) it should be electrically connected with a larger
body. Consequently the back-piece r of the case of receiver I
is made of metal, and is in metallic contact with plate 6. The
neighboring body, which is attracted by plate a in receiver I,
(being, in fact, the plate b,piece r, and screw u, which are all
of metal and in metallic contact,) acts as one body in this
receiver I; but, as will be clear, the back-piece r, plate b,and
screw u may be one single piece of metal, and some other
provision be made for the necessary adjustment.
In receiver I I the terminal a is mounted upon back-piece r,
so that it cannot vibrate, and must therefore be insulated.
Consequently the back-piece r is made of hard rubber. The

Statement of the Case.

plate b, which is the neighboring body in receiver I I, is connected by the wire 2 with a metal band, r, upon back-piece P,

in order to increase the attractive force due to the electrification of a greater mass than plate b, and without interfering
with the proper vibration of plate b, which, in receiver I I,
vibrates as the potential of terminal a varies.
It will be clear that either of the plates b may be grounded,
and thereby increase the electrification of these plates; but it
is not necessary to ground either of them, and the audibility
of the sounds reproduced is practically as great when the
back-piece of the receiver is held in the hand as when the
plates b are both grounded; and it makes no difference whatever whether both be grounded or only one. In other words,
receiver I will reproduce articulate and other sounds, even if
back-piece r be of hard rubber or other non-conductor and
plate b be wholly disconnected from coil F, but the sounds
reproduced are faint, although distinct and audible. The
sounds will be louder if the piece P be of metal, as above
described, or if the plate b or metallic piece ' be grounded;
but the difference is very slight, the sounds being practically
.as loud when the metal piece r is used as when the plate b is
grounded.' Amd so of receiver I I the sounds are distinct and
audible when wire 5 and metal band A are omitted, but
louder when metal band A and wire P are used, as shown, or
when plate b of receiver I I is grounded. Moreover, the reproduction of sound by receiver I does not depend at all upon the
grounding of any part of receiver I I, for receiver I will act
with plate b of receiver I I not grounded precisely as it does
when plate b of receiver I I is grounded, and receiver I I will
.act when plate b of receiver I is not grounded precisely as it
acts when that plate of receiver I is grounded.
In my application filed October 31, 1880, I have described a
receiver in which both the plates a and b are connected with
the coil F, and I therefore disclaim in, this application any
receiver having both the plates connected with that coil, my
present invention consisting in a receiver in which only one
terminal of the coil is used, as above explained.
Instead of making plate b of metal and connecting it metal-

lically with back-piece P or band P2, it may be made of any
non-conductor, and in this case the increased loudness is produced'by electrifying plate b before it is 'put in place; or, as
shown in receiver I I I, where b is a rubber plate, and P8 is
a disk of felt fast to the hard-rubber support b4, which is
turned by the thumb and finger to electrify rubber plate b by
friction.
What I claim as my invention is In combination, a primary coil -in circuit with battery B
and transmitter T, and a secondary coil with its enlarged terminal a mounted in case rt s t, and arranged near plate b, plate b
being also mounted in case P s t, but not connected with the
secondary coil, all substantially as described.

The answer of the Molecular Company further contained
the following averment: "Defendants admit that the Molecular Telephone Company does intend and purpose when it shall
have hereafter made the necessary arrangements to manufacture and use electric speaking telephone instruments of the
character, kind and description substantially as described in
said Letters Patent Nos. 228,824: and 228,825, but defendants
allege that said Molecular Telephone Company has lawful
right so to do. Defendants deny that the said instruments so
described in said patents Nos. 228,824 and 228,825, and about
to be used by defendant, the Molecular Telephone Company,
are substantially like those described in either of said Bell
patents, or that said instruments operate by or according to
the method set forth in either of said Bell patents." No.

following is a translation,) as anticipating the invention covered by claim 5 in Bell's second patent.

"The rapidity with which successive signals can be transmitted depends essentially upon the time required to charge
and discharge the line. This time increases with the length
and section of the conductor; moreover, as the discharge
always occupies a longer interval than the charge, it follows
that the signals will become indistinct at the receiving end if
they are sent into the line before the discharge shall have been
effected, as in this case the charge and discharge combine and
cause a prolongation of the signals, causing them, as it were,
to run together.
"It will be readily understood from this, that the armature
of an electro-magnet or the needle of a galvanometer may be
caused to move even before the current in the line has attained
its permanent condition, and may in like manner return to a
position of rest before the line is completely discharged.
"The armature of an ordinary electro magnet is necessarily
at a greater distance from its poles at the moment when it is

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Statement of the Case.

attracted than at the moment when it is released after having
been attracted; consequently, the strength of. current which
will be required to attract the armature must be much greater
than that which will permit it to be released or drawn away
by the retracting spring. Therefore, a telegraphic signal
which is to be produced by means of the armature of an
-electro-magnet, cannot be completed until the current has
attained the necessary strength to cause it to be attracted, and
has again sufficiently diminished to allow it to be drawn away
by the tension of the spring. The more nearly the values of
these two strengths of current can be made to approximate
each other, the more rapidly successive signals may be received.
Consequently, when the receiving instrument consists of an
electro-magnet, the rapidity of signalling depends essentially
u- pon- the distance of the armature from its poles, and upon
the amount of play which the latter is permitted to have.
The less the distance through which the armature moves, the
more rapidly the signals may be made to succeed each other.
The degree of sensitiveness of an electro-magnetic instrument
has but little influence upon the rapidity with which the signals may be made to succeed each other. For example, let us
suppose 'that the current in the permanent condition of the
line is equal to 25, but that the armature of the electro-magnet is attracted as soon as the current has gained, a strength of
10, and that it falls off again as soon as, by the disconnection
of the battery, the strength of the current has diminished to
'[. A distinct signal will be obtained in this case whenever
the current increases from 7 to 10 and decreases again to 7. If
the apparatus is made less sensitive by increasing th3 tension
of the spring, then the current must be increased in order to
overcome this tension and attract the armature. If we suppose that this attraction takes place when the current has
attained the strength of 15, and that the armature is released
when the current is diminished to 12, the margin will be as
great, if not greater, in the latter case, and therefore the less
sensitive instrument will operate at least as rapidly as the
other.
"In: the arrangement of the electro-magnet which was in-

vented by Hughes, the action is entirely different. In its
normal position of rest, the armature is held nearly in contact
with a permanent magnet, the tension of the retracting spring
being increased to an extent almost sufficient to overcome the
attraction of the latter. When this permanent magnetism is
diminished in the smallest degree by the action of the current,
the armature instantly falls off, and is afterwards replaced in
its original position, not by the action of the current, but by
means of a mechanical device, which is set in action by the
falling off of the armature. Therefore, the sooner the current
attains sufficient strength to release the armature, the quicker
the electro-magnet operates."
Dr. Iran der Weyde was also relied upon as having anticipated some of the inventions claimed under the second patent.
The Clay Commercial Company contested ,the regularity of
the formation of the Corporation complainant (the American
Bell Telephone Company) and further made the following
averments respecting the infringements of the Bell patents
charged in the bill.
"This respondent denies it to be true, as in said bill alleged,
that it has at the city of Philadelphia, or elsewhere, since the
first day of February, in the year of 1884, or at any other

The Overland Company in its answer made the following
averment respecting Drawbaugh's invention: "Because the

obtained a patent for that which was in fact invented by
another, to wit, said Daniel Drawbaugh, who was using
reasonable diligence in adapting and perfecting the same:"

I. The Bell Patent of 1876 describes and claims but one
method of transmitting vocal and other.sounds, which method
is: (1) convert the energy of sound-waves into (2) magnetic
-energy; convert that into (3) vibratory currents of electricity;
convert those into (4)magnetic energy; and with that cause
sound-waves; or, briefly (1) sound; (2) magnet; (3) currents;
(4)magnet; (5) sound.
The undisputed prior methods are (q)The Speaking Tube;
(1) sound; (2) vibrating in column; (3) sound. (b) The Mechanical Telephone; (1) sound; (2) vibration of line; (3) sound.
Bell carefully limits himself in his fifth claim to the described ppyaratus; that is, "to the apparatus for transmitting
tocal or other sounds telegraphically, as Ierein described [that
is to say] by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to
the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other

sounds, substantially as set forth;" and to the described
miethod; that is, to the method of "transmitting vocal or
other sounds telegraphically as herein described, [that is to
say] by causing electrical undulations, similar in form, &c.,
substar,tiallyas setforth.
Bell's counsel, however, set up as the patented invention of
Bell the transmission of speech by neans of "electrical undulations similar inftorm to the vibrations of the air accompany ing the said vocal or other sounds," or, as they otherwise express it, "electrical changes which correspond to the sonorous
motions of the air," rejecting one or both of the limiting
clauses used by Bell, and contending that the patent should
be construed broadly for the use of electricity for the purpose
of transmitting articulate speech. No other construction than
this will suffice to suppress the practice of the Dolbear
method; but such a construction must be based upon a dangerously broad theory of invention, and their claim for the
use of electricity to transmit speech cannot stand. O'Reilly v.
3orse, 15 How. 62.
'II. Bell never invented, so far as appears from the record,
any other method of transmitting vocal or like sounds.
III. Bell in his 1876 patent takes the utmost pains to teach
(what he, in fact, discovered) that, in order to produce currents in a closed circuit, like in form to sound-waves, the currents must be alternately negative and positive; that is, to
and fro currents, so as thereby to copy the to and fro motions
of the air particles constituting the sound-waves.
IV. Bell's apparatus is, i essence, (1) magnet; (2) coil;
(3) closed circuit; (4) coil ; (5) magnet, one magnet being supplied with the proper devices for causing the energy of soundwaves to vary the energy of the magnet, and the other magnet being supplied with the proper devices to cause its varying energy to pioduce sound-waves.
The charadteristic of Bell's invention is the ring circuit, and
is not, as Bell's counsel now contend, "form, not mere continuity." Before Dolbear's patent was granted, Bell's leading
expert testified: "The electrical circuit of the instrument
must always present an uninterrupted path by which the con-

tinually varying current may travel from the transmitter to
the receiver, that is, the circuit containing the battery or
source of electrical power, the transmitter, line wire, receiver,
and earth or return wire, ,rustalways be closed." Bell's specification describes no circuit but the ring circuit running
from the positive pole around to the negative pole, and at the
receiving station traversing the coils of an electro-magnet.
,Throughout his specification there is one constant and sole
agent employed for transmitting the air vibrations and reproducing them to the ear, viz.: a closed circuit with a &hrrent
converted into magnetism whose variations vibrate correspondingly the receiving armature. Strip away as immaterial
everything which can, by the most liberal interpretation, be
so regarded, and then, if anything in the description of the
method of and apparatus for transmitting speech is characteristic of and essential to Bell's invention, it is this, that
the current from transmitting station to receiving station on
which the required electrical changes are to be impressed, is
a current traversing the coils of an electro-magnet, and that
the operative power for vibrating the receiving diaphragm is
the varying magnetism so produced in the electro-magnet.
V. Bell's patent of 1876 does not cover either the Reis
method or the Reis apparatus, but the Reis method -that is,
(1) sound; (2) current; (3) magnet; (4) sound- and the Reis
apparatus- that is, (1) a battery; (9,) its circuit; (3) a transmitter diaphragm, and the electrodes governed by it; (4) a coil; (5)
it- magnet - are both public property; 1st, because of the
printed publications, so fully describing that apparatus, that the
Reis method will necessarily become familiar to any skilled person studying the operation of that apparatus; and 2d, because
Mr. Bell carefully refrained from putting a single word in the
specification of either of his patents which tended to show
that the Reis current of unvarying polarity, but varying only
in strength, was capable of being made similar in form to aiiwaves accompanying vocal or like sounds, and, by the very
strongest implication, asserted in the 1876 patent that rapidly
varying polarity was essential in order that the to and fro
motions of the air particles of a sound-wave should be copied.

Mr. Mlaynadier's Argument for Dolbear.

VI. The battery, primary circuit, transmitter diaphragm,
its electrodes, and the coil and magnet in the primary or transmitter circuit of the Dolbear apparatus do not involve the
method described and claimed in Belrs 1876 patent, nor is the
apparatus substantially the same as any apparatus described
and claimed in Bell's 1876 patent, but this transmitter circuit
and its parts are copied directly from Reis. Dolbear's apparatus is properly termed the Beis-Dolbear apparatus, and the
method used in the Reis portion of the Dolbear apparatus
is precisely that method which any skilled person must necessarily have become cognizant of from a study of the iReis
apparatus when acted upon by vocal or other sounds not loud
enough to break the circuit.

described or suggested in Bell's 1876 patent, and is also radically unlike any method of utilizing electricity ever known
before Dolbear discovered his method and apparatus. The
primary circuit, the primary coil and its core in the Dolbear
apparatus are copied directly from the IReis apparatus, but the
variations of magnetic energy induced in the core by the flowing of the varying primary current spirally around the core
are converted into electric -variations of a kind wholly unknown until discovered by Dolbear. These electric variations
of Dolbear are produced by variations of magnetic energy in
the core of a secondary coil, and inasmuch as secondary coils
containing a core whose magnetism is varied are old and wellknown, it is clear that, speaking generally, the Dolbear variations are like the variations in other secondary coils; but
there are, nevertheless, such marked and striking differences
as make them radically new and entitle them to rank as an
invention second to none in question in this case. The electric
tensi6n, pressure or head, is necessarily small in all telephones
using a closed circuit.. The Dolbear secondary coil forms no
part of a closed circuit, and, in this particular, is radically
unlike Bell's (Fig. 7)and the secondary coil of the commercial

telephone. The fact that the Dolbear line-wire is always
open or broken and never closed, prevents the flow of any
current through any part of the receiver, and for this reason
the electric tension, pressure or head is at the maximum positive or negative. In the Reis-Dolbear diagram the energy of
the air-waves acts upon the diaphragm, which is a fac-simile
of the Reis diaphragm; the vibrations of the air-waves move
that diaphragm just exactly as they do in Reis; the diaphragm controls the voltaic or battery current, just exactly as
in Reis; and variations in that current caused by the varying
pressure of the electrodes one upon the other vary the magnetic energy of a magnet, just exactly as in the commercial
telephone. So that Dolbear's first step is undoubtedly the
variation by air-waves of the magnetic energy of a magnet, it
being thereby.ike Bell's. The first step in the Bell method is
the varying, by force of the air-waves, or of the sound-waves,
of the energy of a magnet. Dolbear's first step is much the
same. But, as one of the experts for the defendants states,
here the resemblance ends. That is the only likeness, the sole
likeness, between the Bell method, as described, and the Dolbear method. That is, the energy of the air-waves in both
may properly and fairly be said to vary the energy of the
magnet. Now, how to utilize that varying magnetic energy.
Inasmuch as the energy of the air-waves varies the magnet,
and is the sole cause for the variations in magnetic energy, it
follows that the magnetic energy must be similar in form to
the energy of the air-waves. Bell utilized it by producing
plus and minus currents. How does Dolbear utilize it? Dolbear, in truth and in fact, produces no currents whatever, nor
any current, on the line. No currents, nor any current, on
the line. He produces simply variations in electric pressure,
or in electric tension, or electric condensations and rarefactions; but no currents.
In the Reis-Dolbear diagram, at the end of the very large
doil which is on the left there is a wire which goes out through
the air, on the poles for instance, and terminates in a plate
shown on the right. There is no connection between that
'plate and the other plate which is opposed to it. The second

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Maynadier's Argument for Dolbear.

plate is fastened to the other end of that coil so that no current can flow through the Dolbear line. The Dolbear line is
an open circuit of necessity. The Bell line is a closed circuit of necessity, That is a radical difference. There is
no magnet, nor anything resembling a magnet, on the right
of Dolbear's line; nor any coil, nor anything resembling
a coil, on the right of the Dolbear line, and the electric
condition of the Dolbear line is radically unlike that of Bell;
the Dolbear receiver is radically unlike that of, Bell, and is
not a known substitute for Bell's receiver, but was wholly
unknown, and not in use for any purpose whatever until iDolbear's discovery, after Bell took out his patent, that that contrivance would produce speech. This is well illustrated as
follows: Take a cylinder, say three feet long and a foot in
diameter, with a piston midway in that cylinder, and a pipe
leading from the left of the cylinder (a small pipe), and going
out say a mile, and there being connected air-tight with a
spiral or helical pipe, and then another pipe at the lower end
of that spiral pipe, coming back a mile into the right-hand
end of the cylinder: then there will be an air apparatus which
is very closely analogous to Bell's apparatus. If the piston
which is midway at the start in the cylinder is moved, say
from right to left, the air in the left-hand end of that cylinder
will be condensed, and the air in the right-hand of the cylinder
will be rarefied. But the air will not be either condensed or
rarefied to any considerable extent, for the reason that these
pipes make a conduit, connecting the right and left-hand ends
of the cylinder; and whenever the air tries to be condensed
in one end, or to be rarefied in the other, the air will flow as
a current through the pipe line, and through the helical pipe,
and neutralize all condensation and rarefaction. This is also
analogous to Bell. If it were true that the flowing of the air
through this helical pipe would set up in a rod of some kind in
the axis of that helix som# form of energy, then it would be
exactly analogous. The main point is that there is a conduit
connecting the two ends of the generator of pressure, which
conduit serves to allow a cuient, to be -ptoduced, which current prevents and neutralizes any marlied increase or decrease

TELEPHONE CiSES.
Mr. Mlaynadier's Argument for Dolbear.

of pressure at the two ends of the generator. And it is by
the flow of that current spirally around something that, all
the work is done.
Now, taking the same cylinder exactly, and the same piston
exactly, and the same small pipe going a mile from the lefthand end, and the same small pipe going a mile from the righthand end, but cutting out the helical pipe which is supposed
to be in the Bell analogy, - cut that out, and screw a cap on
the end of the left-hand pipe, and another cap on the end of
the right-hand pipe, and have these caps air-tight, and there is
something closely analogous to the Dolbear method. Moving
the piston as before, all the air in the left-hand end of the
cylinder, and all the air in the pipe leading from that end, and
all the air in the cap at the end of that pipe is condensed, and
all the air in the cap and pipe at the right-hand end of the
cylinder is rarefied, and there is no current tending to diminish
the condensation or rarefaction.
There can be no current, because the pipes are hermetically
closed, and the current cannot flow. There are then, in fact;
two pressure chambers/one a high-pressure chamber, and the
other a low-pressure chamber; and the maximum high pressure and the maximum low pressure which the motion of the
piston will give is obtained. But not so in*Bell's. In Bell's
nothing. like the maximum high or the maximum low pressure
can be obtained, because the current flows and prevents it.
Stating the same thing exactly in the electrical language : in
the lReis-Dolbear diagram the secondary coil is very much
larger than it is in the Reis-Bell diagram, which represents
the commercial Bell telephone.
The only difference between the coils is; - one is very much
larger than the other. The secondary coil is the generator of
the electro-motive force. Electro-motive force means electrical pressure, tension, or head. If a high electro-motive force
be joined to a 16w onei or to a lower one, by a wire or conduit of any kind, the current will flow from the higher to the
lower. Just as if a tank of water ten feet up be joined by A
pipe to la tank of water one foot up from a certain level, a current of water will flow. What happens in Dolbear's method is

that, whenever the magnet varies in strength, then the big
coil, which is the generator, generates an electric pressure at
one end, and an electric vacuum at the other. Plnum et

Electric plus at one end, and electric mihus at the other end
of the coil or generator. To the plus end of the coil a wire is
attached; to the minus end of the coil a wire is attached. So
far it is exactly like Bell's, except as to the size or power of
the coil. But those wires are not in electrical contact anywhere. They must be in electrical contact in Bell. In Bell
they must be joined by a coil, because the currenu must flow
spirally around a soft iron core. In order to do Bell's work
they must flow from left to right, and again from right to
left, rapidly alternating. But the whole function of the secondary coil in Dolbear is to make a very large electrical pressure, plus at one end and minus at the other.
Do~bear reie&s on eleotricaZ attraction pure and s&i 2pe. It
appears throughout this case that for no practical purpose
whatever was this eec.rical attraction,this static electricity,
this amberism, ever used by anybody, anywhere, until Dolbear
first used it in his'telephone. It is therefore not a known substitute or anything like a known substitute for Bell's electrical
currents.
VIII. In both the commercial telephone and the Dolbear
telephone the :Reis apparatus is used as a transmitter circuit ii
connection with a secondary coil which forms part of the line
wire.
Although at first sight this fact may seem to make the Dolbear telephone substantially like the Bell commercial telephone in one important particular, yet it cannot have any
weight whatever in view of the radical difference between the
secondary coil and -line of the Dolbear telephone and the
secondary coil and line of the Bell commercial telephone, or
the transmitting coil and line of Fig. 7 of Bell's patent; that
is to say, Dolbear's secondary coil must be a generator of
enormous electro-motive force, or electric tension, pressure, or
head, while the generator of the Bell produces relatively
trifling electro-motive force or tension, pressure, or head; an

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Maynadier's Argument for Dolbear.

electrical conduit joining the positive and negative is essential
to Bell and fatal to Dolbear, and Dolbear's line and its connected plate is charged to a very high potential tension, pressure, or head, alternately positive and negative, and there are
no currents, properly speaking, in the Dolbear line, but only
such flow as is necessary to charge the line and the plate or
disc connected with it.
IX. Wholly disregarding Reis, and assuming that Bell is
the first in the field, yet the Dolbear method and ,apparatus is
substantially unlike any, method or apparatus described or
claimed in the Bell patent of 1876, for the reason -that Dolbear
does not utilize electrical undulat:ons substantially the same as
those described and claimed in the Bell patent of 1876, but
utilizes electrical undulations radically un.like any other known
until Dolbear discovered his method and apparatus, and for
the reason that there is nothing in either the Dolbear method
or apparatus copied from anything described or suggested in
the Bell patent of 816; - and Bell's fifth claim is to be so construed as to enable inventors of substantially different methods
of telephony to practise their methous. The _roblem of telephony was stated in a scientific article published in 1863, in
which Reis's wyork, up to that time was discussed. Let all the
sonorous air vibrations of speech be electrically represented;
let them all be translated into electricity; let there be electrical changes corresponding to the sonorous air vibrations, and
let them reproduce sonorous air vibrations like the first; if
you can do that, you will transmit speech. In the court
below the Bell patent was construed to cover doing that, w
matter how, and that construction is contended for in this
court. But that construction cannot -stand under the law.
The writer of the article published in 1863 as a commentary
on Reis's work, says: "If we succeed in transmitting with
the galvanic current the oscillations of a sounding body to a
distance, so that there another body is put to equally rapid
and, in, .respect to each other, equally strong oscillations, the
problem of telephoning is solved, for then exactly the same
phenomena of waves are called forth on the distant points as
the ear receives at the place of origin; therefore they also

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Mkaynadier's Argument for Dolbear.

must make the same impression. Even speeoh must be heard
in places very distant from each other." ' Therefore the problem, 'the statement of which is called Bell's invention to-day,
was as well recognized in 1863 as it is now. But Bell's
patented invention is not the restatement of this problem,
bit the solution of it which he invented and patented. Bell
-dndertook to solve and did solve the problem by one method.
Dolbear subsequently undertook to solve and did solve the
problem by another and substantially different method.
In Tilghman v. Poctor,102 U. S. -707,which seems to be
quite conclusive of this case, and to present a singularly close
analogy to it, the patent was for a process of separating
neutral fats into glycerine and free fat acids by the use of
water -

hot water -

under such pressure as prevented its

evaporation into steam. Upon a revision of the judgment of
the court rendered in a previous case, it was held that a wide
departure as to degree of heat, and a wide departure as to
duration of exposure to heat, might well be included within
the invention of the patentee, because he was the first man
who used water, heat and pressure for the purpose at all, and
his invention was of a process, and not of an apparatus. The
opinion says, upon page 729: "The claim of the patent is
not for a mere principle. The chemical principle or scientific
fact upon -which it is founded is that the elements of neutral
fat require to be severally united with an atomic equivalent of
water in order to separate from each other and become free.
"This chemical fact was not discovered by Tilghman. He
only claims to have invented a particular mode of bringing
about the desired chemical union between the fatty elements
and water. He claims the process of subjecting to a high
degree of heat a mixture continually kept up, of nearly equal
quantities of fat and water, in a convenient vessel ,trong
enough to resist the effort of the mixture tQ convert its6lf into
steam. This is most certainly a process."
Now, in the present case also, there is a principle-or scientific fact involved. If you would transmit speech, you uhust
have the electrical condition of the wire vary with the varying
conditions of the air brought about by speech, and produce
VOL. CXXvW-11

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Maynadier's Argument for Dolbear.

again like varying conditions of the air. This is the alternative statement of transmitting speech by electricity. There is
the problem. What is the solution? The parallel With the
case of Tilghman v. Proctor seems to be perfect. In that
case there was a problem. Find a way, if you can, to combine each atom of water with an atom of acid. If you can do
that, then you can reach this important result of resolving the
neutral fats into glycerine and acids. And Tilghman's solution of it was: Heat the water under such pressure that the
water shall not pass into steam. This was his process; and
he claimed, and the court justly allowed, great latitude in its
application.
Now what was the method invented by Mr. Bell for solving the problem presented to him. The answer is plain.
When he took his patent, there was but one agent that had
ever been used for variably attracting any object so as to
make it vibrate and beat the air and give out audible sound.
That agent was magnetism. There was but one practical use
to which electricity had ever been put for the purpose of socausing a body to vibrate and give out audible sounds; and
that was as a flowing current making an iron core an electro-

magnet, the variations of current strength causing like magnetic variations. Mr. Bell found a way to get electrical
changes, corresponding in form to the sound-waves; in the
current traversingthe coils of an electro-magnet, and so to pro-

duce corresponding variations in the magnet, and corresponding vibrations of a receiver armature. But under the broadest
construction permissible, Bell's patent cannot include something which neither he nor any other man had then done or
supposed could be done; that is to say, cause an armature to
vibrate and give audible sounds by variations of electrical
attraction, with no use of magnetism at all. It cannot inelude causing an armature to vibrate and give audible sounds
by variations of electrical attraction, variations of that electrical charge of tension which is brought about by rubbing a
piece of sealing-wax, for example,-

in a word, by amberism,

-which Dolbear has reduced to the service of mankind for
the first time. Dolbear's receiver, though properly enough

TELEPHONE CASES.
'Mr. Lowrey's Argument for 'Molecular Telephone Co.

called a "condenser," is radically different from the old "con-.
densers," for in the Dolbear receiver one of the plates is held
firmly so that it cannot vibrate, and the other is held so as to
be free to vibrate (according to the variations of electrical
charge) and beat the air and give audible sound; the two
plates being separated by a body of air so that no current can
pass.
Here is a change of construction designed to produce a new
operation, for a new purpose, without which change that operation could not be performed nor that purpose answered. No
operation of vibrating either plate by variations of electrical
charge was contemplated or performed in the old condensers.
The arrangement of the parts or elements of the old condensers did not admit of its being performed.
To hold one element of a condenser still, so that it shall not
vibrate, and suspend the other so that it shall vibrate, and
then imake use of its vibration according to variations of electric charge, was wholly and absolutely new. No such instrument existed. No suchkuse of any instrument had ever been
proposed or supposed to be possible. It cannot be said with
any show of reason that any equivalent for it was found in
any of the old condensers.

Certain Errors to be corrected iv Lirine.
Two popular errors which have a tendency to mislead the
judgment, should be corrected at the outset, viz.:

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Afr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

(1) That " vocal sounds" and "articulate speech" are convertible terms in acoustics or telegraphy.
"Vocal sound" is an utterance common to all animals possessing the organ of voice'. "1Articulate speech" is a series
of sounds uttered in accordance with the laws of language in
arbitrary sequence, to express ideas. At the 'date of Bell's
patent "vocal sounds" was a term used in connection with
multiple telegraphy, in which the signals were certain sustained or broken musical notes of a given pitch. The use of
that term in the fifth claim does not, therefore, imply. that
articulate speech -was contemplated.
(2) That this controversy relates to a telephonic devicethe invention of Mr. Bell.
No part of the transmitting instrument so familiar to our
eyes, in the commercial business of telephony, was invented
or is claimed by him. When, therefore, the appellees speak of
a Bell telephone, they refer not to any device which they claim
was invented by Mr. Bell, but to any and every telephone
which transmits speech "by causing electrical undulations
similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying"
the transmitted sound.
No telephone can transmit speech except by producing in
the line wire some electrical action equivalent to the exciting
cause.
What that action is cannot be known; but Mr. Bell and
others have inferred

-perhaps

not unreasonably - that it

consists in a series of changes in current strength; and one
of them, Mr. Varley, in 1870, gave to these changes the name
"undulations."

Bell having adopted the inference and the name, has according to his present interpretation of the Patent Office
language'- patented the inference.
Points of Difference arisingupon, the Record.
The differences between the litigants in the Molecular case
arise chiefly on the interpretation of the fifth claim. Certain
particular facts and ideas affecting, modifying or arising out
of these differences need to be indicated at the outset in order
to relieve the later discussion from repetition. -

Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

Appellants' Construction f the 5th. Claim.
The appellants concede the fifth claim to be . good claim
when restricted to a speciic 4pparatus (Fig. 7 of the patent),
which includes a closed circuit incapable of being oened, and
a continuous current incapab3le-of being intermittent; and the
method by which alone that apparatus can be operated.
Any broader interpretation they regard as an unauthorized
enlargement of the words of the patent, resulting in a monopoly-to (1) some things invented before BelPs time; (2) some
other things invented afterwards, and in no sense derived from
him; and to (3) scientific facts or laws of nature, the monopolizing of which no statute justifies.
APpellees' Construction.
The appellees regard this claim - and upon their persuasion
the courts below have so interpreted it - as a "broad claim"
to all electrical transnission of speech, which results from
"causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying" the sound; on the ground
that Bell first discovered that this is the way in which speech
is transmitted electrically. In fact, the words of the claim are
a mere formula to express that, thing, whatever it may be,
which occurs in the line wire when speech is transmitted.
A claim is thus virtually made to speech transmission by
the tranmsrittingof it; or, in other words, for all such doing of
a thing as is _provable by its being done.
The significance and far-reaching effect of such a claim
(thus interpreted) needs only to be realized, to be rejected by
an application of the argumenturn' ab inccrvenienti. To test
this an analogous claim covering speech transmission by the
air,as a medium, may be formulated and compared with Bell's
actual claim, as follows:

tions would have done. To do this, however,
the mechanical arrangement must be such as
will enable the syllables to reproduee their vibrations- so that none shall be lost- throughout
all the intervening izedia" (including of course
the wire).
5. Bell says: "I will do this by 'method of
and apparatus for causing electrical ,undulations
similar ir form to the vibrations of the air
accompanying' such sounds."
If we now attempt to frame a patent claim for, say, proposition 2, it will be apparent that such a claim will cover proposition 1- and that would be intolerable to common sense. If
we attempt to patent proposition 5, which is Bell's precise
claim, (with its present. interpretation understood), we shall

Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephlone Co.

find that we have covered proposition 3 - which is again intolerable as being too broad; and besides was anticipated by
proposition 4, which was announced to the world at a much
earlier date.
This broad construction has nevertheless been sustained
upon an elaborate exposition, by counsel and experts, of the
physical laws involved in the operation of telephony; and an
assumption that (1) some- of these essential laws and conditions were unknown before Bell, and were-discovered by him;
(2) that iReis failed in 1861 to transmit speech because he was
ignorant of them; (3) that his system demands a mode of
operation inconsistent with those laws; and that therefore it
could never succeed.

of -Reis and others before 1861- as due to a right understanding of them.
I

During all the period to which it is necessary to refer, a gene
eral principle of philosophy has fully possessed the scientific
minds of the world, viz., that all forces of nature act and exist
under certain laws of correlation which assume that energy is
indestructible, and that its forms are capable of mutual conversion. It was not only believed but demonstrated that mechanical action (which is a motion of masses) may be transformed into heat and 'electricity (which was held to be a motion of the atoms of matter), and vice versa. These mutations
were found to be rigidly subject to the laws of quantity, i.e. a
given amount of one force was known to produce a definite
quantity of another. This implies that where the originating
force is variable, the resulting force will be correspondingly
variable. These relations of the modes of energy commonly
known by the phrase, "correlation of forces," or "persistence
of forces" has formed a living element in scientific literature,
and occupied the thoughts and guided the investigations of
)hilosophical inquirers since about 1835.
It was also known that sound is a vibratory to and fro
motion in ordinary matter; and that'different sounds produce

OCTOBER TERAI,

Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

different vibrations both as to the number of to and fro motions which an air particle will make in a given time, and also
in the extent or amplitude of these vibrations. The rate of
the vibration was imputed as the cause of pitch in sounds; and
the amplitude of the vibration was imputed as the cause of its
loudness. As these varied, the pitch and loudness varied.
But besides pitch and loudness, a characteristic which in
acoustics is called "quality" enters into sounds, and enables
us to distinguish one voice, instrument or other'sound-producing cause from another, while both are giving forth the same
pitch and loudness; and this was also known prior to 1861.
The physicists inferred that this effect must arise from something in the movement of the air particle besides its rate and
amplitude. They concluded that the air-particle journey performed under the impulse of one voice, differed from that
which, at the same pitch and loudness, it performed under the
impulse of another voice.
Thus in one case the movement might rise to a maximum
of speed quickly; and in t6e other, slowly. In one it might
maintain a nearly uniform rate of increase and decrease
throughout, while in the other, there would be apparent
irregularities.
These variations they called the "form" of the motion; as
its results had before been called the "quality" of the resulting sound. Probably the term "form." was adopted from the
use of graphical curves, by which the order and succession
of motions or events are exhibited in the shape of a curved
line.
ParticularApplication of these Principlesto Electric
Telephony.
All these things being known prior to 1861, the date to
which attention must be called, it results that any physicist
engaged at that time upon an effort to transmit and reproduce
sounds by electricity must be considered to have known that
as the motion of the air particle accompanying the sound may
vary in form, violence or amplitude, the ele trical changes -

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

or " undulations " - into which that motion is to be transformed, must correspondingly vary.
Under the general philosophical principles above stated,
and which were universally accepted at the dates of Reis's inventions and publications, it was also clear that nature's way
of transforming mechanical energy (such as the to and fro
movement of an air particle) with all its variations of force,
into electrical energy of similar mutations, was,'and necessarily
must always be, by successively reducing or increasing in a
corresponding manner the strength of an electrical current.
The phrase "electrical undulations similar in form," etc., is,.
therefore, a mere restatement of that universally recognized
law, for the purpose of applying it to the specific subject of
electrical sound transmission. These things being understood,
it remained for the inventor and man of science to devise
mechanical means and processes by which to bring about these
needed electrical mutations in an order a-ad degree suitable tomaintain and reproduce the air vibrations accompanying the
particular sound whose reproduction at a distance was desired.
The mechanical devices sought for might vary, and the
processes which within themselves they were to develop
might vary, but it was known that the process of nature -to
wit, the creation of something, in the electrical field (called by
Bell, " u n dulations ") equivalent in sequence, power and form
to the motion of the air particle accompanying a sound was the only process by which those motions could be counterfeited at a distance. This last process being a recognized
law of nature, which experimenters and investigators were
endeavoring to find means to bring into action, has been in
previous adjudications confounded by the courts with those
other invented processes or methods which are provided to
control the operation of the mechanical devices of man. It
will be easy to see, in reading the decisions below, that in using
the terms "means," "method," and "process," the courts
sometimes intend the means, method, or process of Bell's
apparatus for taking up the sound-wave and bringing its
energy to bear upon the electrical current; and in other cases
they intend the means, method, or process by which the elec-

OCTOBER TERI, 1887.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

trical current, acting under a universal law, receives that
energy and sustains and finally retransforms it; and these
two meanings they confound to the prejudice of a correct
intellectual judgment.
The appellants object to nothing in the judgments sustaining the fifth claim except that which grants to Mr. Bell a
monopoly of the right to appeal to nature and to solicit heracting according to her own laws-to receive, sustain, and
retransforin mechanical energy of sound-waves, when brought
to the electrical current by an invented method and apparatus
different from those of Mr. Bell.
Two diferent methods and apparatus by which sound-wave
energy may be successfully transformed into electrical
energy.
There arejtwo mechanical methods by which man's invention is able to invoke and avail of this law of nature.
One was invented by Mr. Bell, and is called the "magnetoelectric method." It involves a closed circuit and continuous
current, without possibility of change.
The other was not invented by ir. Bell, and is called the
"variable resistance method." It involves a circuit which
may be opened and a current which may be made intermittent,
automatically and irregularly.
As is apparent from the construction of the Reis instruments, the latter was employed by IReis and he was under
the impression that his instruments regularly continued their
variation of the degree of resistance to a point at which
it became infinite; that is to say, to the point of brealing
the current altogether. That his opinions upon this point
have no relevancy in this contest will be shown hereafter; as
also that his opinion as to the operation of his instrument is
probably a mistaken one. The method used by him of placing
in his transmitting instrument two electrodes innormal contact which could be separated so that no current could pass,
(but which under the impulse of air-waves were really intended to vary their idegree of pressure and the consequent

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Mlolecflar Telephone Co.

degree of resistance only so far as was necessary to accomplish
the intended work), is now in universal use in telephony.
There are numerous devices for operating by this principle.
The Molecular Company's transmitter is one; and the Blake
transmitter, used by the appellees, is another. Neither of
these instruments could be used in the "closed circuit" method
described by Bell in his patent, and by which method alone
can the apparatus described in his patent (the magneto-electric
telephone) be used.

The above drawing is copied from the patent, and together
with the text of the patent, it clearly shows what "method"
is applicable to what "apparatus."
The method may now be defined as follows: A method of
transforming the mechanical energy of air-waves into electrical
energy, by moving a piece of inductive material (diaphragm)
in front of the poles of an electro-magnet, by which movement new electrical currents are set up in the coils of the
electro-magnet; which, passing over a connected line in degrees of strength constantly varied by the movement of the
inductive material, vary the magnetic power of a second
electro-magnet; causing it to exercise a variable attraction on

diaphragm and reproduce in the adjacent air-particles, vibrations similar to those which accompanied the original sound.
The novelty in all this consisted not in the idea of transmitting sounds; not in the use of a movable membrane, disc, or
diaphragm, for that purpose; not in the use of the energy of
air-waves to act upon the membrane, etc., and thus to reproduce sounds; not in the employment of electro-magnets, conductors, or other electrical means-for all these were old;
but-simply-in using the energy of air-waves to actuate

mechanically a little dynamo machine and to cause it-not to
moul7d an existing current -but to create new currents.
The essential characteristic of operation which distinguishes.
this method, more abstractly stated, is: A magnetic field,
disturbed by the shifting presence of an inducing body, which
thereby creates electricity of varying direction and electromotive force, in the wire. The efficient is the magnetic force
its source is the magnetic field; and the battery currentwhere a battery is used (as shown in the drawing above), is not in any sense the cause of work, being used merely to
magnetize the cores of the electro-magnets. The current constantly varies in its direction as the diaphragm advances or
recedes, and the circuit is never and can never be brokenthere being one complete metallic or earth connection from
the transmitter to the receiver and back again.

Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

introduces the possibility that the variation may be carried to
the extent 'of breaking it altogether, by exceeding a certain
degree of loudness in the tones which it is called on to take
up and transmit. With this mechanical element in its construction, by which the apparatus, working automatically,
constantly varies the connection of its parts - sometimes
separating them entirely- the circuit cannot properly be
spoken of as a "closed circuit" within the sense of this patent,
because it may be broken.
In the variable resistance method the energy of soundwaves is taken up by a movable diaphragm, which being acted
upon by the impact of the air particles, moves to and fro in
such a way as to produce a constant variation of pressure
between the electrodes, from one to the other of which a current must pass (in conventional phrase) from its. source in the
battery to the receiver. By awell-known law this variation
of pressure results in a constantly changing degree of resistance to the passage of the current, which has the effect to
weaken or strengthen the current momentarily throughout
the entire line, whereby the magnetic attraction of the electromagnet in the receiver is varied and its related diaphragm is
moved accordingly. All this being done under the influence
of the movements of the first diaphragm, the result is that
the second diaphragm copies the movements of the first and
thereby causes air vibrations at the receiving station similar to
those accompanying the original sound.
These two ways of producing current changes by the energy
of sound-waves are two different methods in the arts and the
law; and would be proper subjects of separate patents. The
magneto method, invented by Bell, as appellants insist, is what
is referred to by him in the fifth claim as "The method of

the method depends on the circuit being capable of being open
or closed - with a capacity for all degrees of pressure between
the surfaces of the electrodes, from utmost contact to no

In order that the apparatus capable of use in this may be
contrasted with that capable of use in the other method, we
exhibit an outline drawing of the Blake transmitter, a variable
resistance instrument now in universal use by the Bell Company, and which is as incapable of being used by Bell's
method, as Bell's apparatus is of being used by the Blake, or
variable resistance, method.

[At this point Mr. Iowrey explained the principles and

magneto telephone; and of the Blake and molecular transmitters, as examples of the variable resistance telephones, of
-which, as he stated, there are numerous forms. He contrasted
the Blake transmitter with the lReis-Legat, deducing from the
fact that both wera provided with springs and adjusting
screws by which to control the degree of pressure between
the electrodes, that they are alike variable resistance instruments; and that the sole and entire effect of appellees' argument was to allow the Reis-Legat screw to be turned (say)
twice- at which adjustment perhaps the transmitter would
not transmit - and to prevent it being turned three times, at
which adjustment speech could certainly be heard.]

-ing

The early judgments sustainingBell's claim were founded 'on
" concessions" which were not true - and were not conceded.
The claim of Bell to every transmission of sound "by causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of
the air" (that being only another way of claiming the transmission of sound by transmitting it), needed a broad base to
support it. This was supplied by the astounding concession
made to him (by the court) in the Spencer case, that he is
"admitted . . . to be the original first inventor of any
mode of transmitting speech," and by the further statement,
"but Bell discovered a new art,- that of transmitting speech
by eiectricity, - and has a right to hold the broadest claim for
it which can be permitted in any case; not to the abstract
right of sending sounds by telegraph without any regard to
means, but to all means and processes which he has both -invented and claimed;" and that "the invention is nothing less
than the transfer to a wire of electrical vibrations li7ce those
which a sound hasproducedin the air." 8 Fed. Rep. 511.
If these concessions had been true, the consequences inferred
would be fairly disputable; but they are not true.
This Court must consider:

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

(1) Of what does' this "art" consist?
(2) Had it not, as a generic art, been discovered and announced to the world prior to the date of Mr. Bell's investigations?
(3) Does not the state of the art at the date of Bell's invention necessarily limit his fifth claim to that natural interpretation which covers whatever is accomplished by uttering a
sound before the transmitter of a magneto telephone connected
in an hermetically closed circuit-that being his only invention.
The operating of such an apparatus, by the energy of air
waves, is a method of setting on foot the transmission of
sounds.
It is the method, and the only method described in the specification of the patent in connection with the transmittingof
-sounds; and it is the only method capable of use by the apparatus delineated and described in the same connection.
A claim for "the method of and apparatus for" doing any
particular thing must mean a method by which the designated
apparatus can work; and an apparatus by which the described
method can be employed.

the inventor's means for observation, and could therefore be

plained in this paper. The sworn evidence of numerous witnesses is that the apparatus succeeded well in transmitting the
tones of various instruments, and the tones of the human voice
in the singing of words, and that it did also, on numerous occasions, transmit and reproduce the tones of the human voice in
speaking. T6 this there is the testimony of Professor Quincke,
at present vice-rector and actual head of the Heidelberg University;' IDr. Rudolph Messel, a well-known chemist of London; Johann Philipp Schmnidt, paymaster in the Imperial
German Navy; Heinrich Hold, of Friedrichsdorf; Johann

action were constructed by Reis for the same purpose. One
of them was publicly explained by V. Legat, Royal Prussian
Telegraph Inspector, in 1862. Concerning these different instruments, the evidence is now that without material change
of any of their parts, they will, with care and proper adjustment, all transmit speech, though imperfectly. This adjustment is, in the case of the Reis-Legat instrument, by means of

a set screw and spring by which the contact of the electrodes
is controlled; in the case of the cubical box instruinent, by
proper weighting of the parts with the same objeU.; and
by similar means in the case of the bored block "trument.
The witnesses to this are Professors Brackett- and Young, of
Princeton College; Prof. A. E. Dolbear, of Tufts College,
BostOn; Prof. Charles R. Cross (appellees' expert); Messrs.
Channing, Waite, Green, Paddock, and others. There is proof
by-several witnesses that in 1869, in the City of New York,
at a public exhibition, they heard such instruments - made
by Prof. Van der Weyde - transmit and reproduce the tones
of the human voice in singing, and were able to distinguish
words, which they now repeat.
With what has been said it will now be convenient to consider various facts and arguments as to their bearing on the
subject stated, and which may for convenience be restated as
follows:
(1) The general history of the art of sound transmission, which is to be examined with a view to determine whether
the principles of that art were not known before Bell's investigations.
(2) The general language and true scope and meaning of
the patent of 1876,- which is to be examined with a view
to determine whether it has been unwarrantably expanded by
construction; and
(3)Whether under any circumstances so broad an interpretation as that adopted in the courts below can be sustained. *

TEIEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Iolecular Telephone Co.

Te PI ifeiple8 of Sound Transmission.
Electric telephony rests upon the sciences of acoustics and
electricity, or magnetism.
Acoustics is that branch of natural philosophy which treats
of the physical nature of sound, and the laws of its origin,
propagation and effects.
Sound may be considered as a physical, or as a physiological
phenomenon.
Physically, it is a particular vibratory motion in ordinary
matter. Its existence implies that the sound-producing body
has been thrown by some means into a state of agitation or
tremor, which motion has been communicated to the neighboring air particles.
Considered in the physiological sense, sound is a sensation
of the organ of hearing and of the brain. In order that the
ear may be affected and the sensation of tone evoked, it is
necessary that there should be interposed between the soundin- body and the ear, one or more intermediate bodies (rnedia)
capable of molecular vibration. The air forms the most important medium for this purpose, but all matter may serve to
transmit motion; that is to say, one particle or one mass of
matter being by motion brought in contact with another,
causes the other to move similaxly, and in that way motion is
said to be transmitted. The approximate cause of the sensation of sound is the condensation and rarefaction of the air
lying against the ear drum. Thus sound begins in the motion
of matter and results in the production of a physiological
effect. In that effect the ear recognizes the character of the
motion. It recognizes (1) pitch -that is, that the sounds are
high or low; (2) intensity - that is, that the sounds are loud or
soft; (3) quality- that is, they are distinguishable as emanating from one or another instrument, from the human voice,
4,r from one or many of countless causes.
These effects arise from differences in (1) the extent, (2) the
number and (3) the character of the vibrations made by an air
particle in obedience to some motion of the sound-producing
cause.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
fr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

Simple and Campound Sounds.
All sounds capable of being appreciated by the ear are
simple or compound; and among compound sounds, the most
complex are the sounds of articulate speech.
A simple sound is one which causes the air particles to move
in a 'straight line to and fro with a velocity of uniform increase
and decrease; and is called pendular, because in this respect
it is like the motion of a pendulum. That motion is represented by a curve called "sinusoidal," as follows:

X

A compound sound is one which is composed of several
tones each of which, if sounded alone, would give to the air
particle a pendular motion, but which, when sounded together,
give it an irregular motion, compounded of all the forces of
the different sounds. Compound sounds are variously represented, and are for illustration represented by the following
plate, which shows by different lines from a to b all the mo-

Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

tions of six different tones; while the line from c to d represents the actual motion which the air particle takes on in
obedience to the simultaneous sounding of all these different
tones. In this case it appears that the air particle sprang at
once to a maximum of speed, which it reached -speaking
roughly -before it had traversed one-sixth of its appointed
journey -and then fell off rapidly at three intervals until it
stopped, and returned by a motion almost exactly reversed.
In acoustics the principle of sound conduction is the same,
therefore, whether the sound be complex or simple; that is to
say, the principle is that the air particle will act in obedience
to the particular sound, whatever it may be, by moving to and
fro in a manner peculiarly deduced from the influence of the
particular sound-producing cause or causes. As soon as a
sound-producing body causes the air particles (1) not only to
move to and fro a requisite number of times in a given time,
but also (2) a definite distance backward' and forward, and (3)
also to do something else at the same time, so as to produce
such difference in the sounds as will enable the listener to distinguish the sound-producing cause -then the sound isperceivable in all its elements of pitch, loudness and.'luality.
"Quality" is a term arbitrarily used by physicists for a long
time, to indicate something done by the air particle outside of
rate and amplitude of motion. What this something -is, is
entirely a matter of hypothesis.
Helmholtz, in his "Sensations of Tone," says:
"On inquiring to what external physical difference in the
waves of sound the different qualities of tone correspond, we
must remember that the amplitude of the vibration determines
the force or loudness, and the period of vibration the pitch.
Quality of tone can, therefore, depend upon neither of these.
The only possible hypothesis, therefore, is that the quality of
tone should depend upon the manner in which the motion is
performed within the period of each single vibration."
Upon this hypothesis rests, therefore, the assumption at
present universally made and accepted for purposes of scientific reasoning, that quality depends upon certain assumed or
postulated eccentricities of conduct of the air particle while

engaged in performing the certain number of journeys of a
certain length in a certain time. Upon this Mr. Bell forms a
similar hypothesis for electricity, and has drawn the conclusion
that the electrical current similarly undulates, or undergoes
changes of force, - and, in the case of his magneto system,
also of direction.
This conclusion-built up, hypothesis upon hypothesis may or may not be true. Upon ultimate analysis, therefore,
the fifth claim (as interpreted) appears to be clearly, for an
intellectual conclusion from hypothetical premises, only; and
is therefore, merely, a patented hypothesis.
It has been necessary for appellees' counsel to treat "quality" as a new idea in physics, not known in 1861 when Philipp
Reis produced the first instrument ever made for transmitting
sounds electrically. It was necessary that they should do this
in order to sustain a forced interpretation of the language of
Reis in describing his instrument and its principles of operation. They say that Reis did not know of quality or its cause.
This is not true, as may be seen in Young's Lectures on :Natural Philosophy, published in 1807, Vol. I, p. 388, as well as
in the other numerous citations in our brief of dates prior to
1861.
Philipp Reis, on introducing his telephone in 1861, wrote an
article in which he said that the "ear can no longer satisfactorily discern the relation of the proportionally great vibration8 which determine the pitch, to the small vibrations on
which vocal quality depends."
In these early expressions, made before any pecuniary interest had arisen to stinulate men to great scrutiny and exactness, and before a scientific terminology had been evolved and
adopted, it is natural that IReis should choose his own terms,
and h- did it well. The cut showing the curve of a compound
sound, shows what Reis meant by "great vibrations" in dis"
tinction to "small vibrations on which vocal quality depends.;'
The full length of one vibration forward and back is shown by
the entire length of the curved line above the straight or zero
line, and then across it and below it until it crosses the second time; and that is'a "great vibration." The "zig-zag"

shown both above and below the zero line represents those
changes in velocity (and sometimes, for an infinitely short
space, of direction) which are the "small vibrations" (included
in the great vibration) "on which vocal" (or all) "quality depends."
Afterwards, in the same year, Reis read to the Physical
Society of Frankfort a "Statement of a new theory about the
perception of chords and the quality of sounds as a continuation of and supplement to the lecture on the telephone."
It should be considered as beyond dispute, that Reis understood that the air particle in doing its work represented quality by irregularity of movement; and that when he spoke of
reproducing these movements electrically he knew that none
of 'these "small vibrations" must be lost on their journey
through the electrical field; or, in Bell's words, that the electrical undulations to be caused must be similar in fo2 to the
air vibration, &c.
The claim made for Mr. Bell, as already stated, that he first
found out that quality needed something special for its transmission, is elucidated in a manner gratifying to appellants by
Mr. Bell in an affidavit in the Drawbaugh case, that "Before
this time, I had perfectly satisfied myself that the true and
only method for the telegraphic transmission of vocal sounds
involved as its fundamental element an apparatus which
should transmit amplitude or intensity, as well as pitch for quality, or timbre, or articulation, are ultimately resolvable
into those two characteristics of vibration, &c., to be transmitted." 'Molecular Record, p. 2158.
Thus we find Mr. Bell stating that quality is resolvable into
the two things, namely, amplitude (loudness) and rate (pitch),
which are contemplated by Reis in his use of the term "great
vibrations" as distinguished from "smaller vibrations" (quality). What was needed was "an apparatus."
We also find Prof. Cross testifying on this subject satisfactorily :
"The quality of a sound depends upon the number, loudness
and relative pitch of the different partial tones. If the pitch
and loudness of each partial tone can be accurately repro-

. 5. McDonough, R.,p. 240.
"x-Int. 214. What do you understand him (Reis) to mean
by the statement, 'Our ear can under no circumstances
appreciate more than can be represented by these curves'?"
"Ans. Reis knew that all the characteristics of sound are
due to differences in the condensations and rarefation of the
air conveying the sound-waves, and since these differences can
all be represented graphically, he saw and stated, as in your
quotation, that it was possible thus to represent all of the variation which-affected the ear." BTh., 186.
In the same examination, Prof. Cross says:
"x-Int. 218. In fact, the curve in the first diagram ,of
Reis'9 lecture represents only the two characteristics of sound,
- pitch and loudness?"

to transmit all sounds through the agency of electrical
currents.
Iesumg of .Material Facts known to Physicists in 1861.
The material facts in acoustics, magnetism and electricity
which were known prior to 1861, and knowledge of which
must therefore be imputed to Philipp Reis, may be recapitulated as follows:
1. That sounds are propagated vibrations of matter.
2. That the loudness of any sound is determined by the amplitude of the vibration, or the distance through which the
air particle moves to and fro.
3. That the pitch of a *ound. is determined by the number
of times in which an air particle will traverse this amplitude
in a given time.
4. That simple sounds give simple periodic and regular
vibrations.
5. That all sounds are compound whose vibrations are the
result of simultaneous action of several simple tones, whether
resulting from one or from a number of sounding bodies.
6. That the term "quality" pertains to, and is predicable of,
all compound sounds - of which articulate speech is only one
class; and that the air particle, in obeying the impulses of the
compound sound-producing causes, no longer makes the motion
due to any one of them, but another motion, which is a compromise upon, and the algebraic sum of, all their varying and
perhaps conflicting hnpulses.
7. That quality is expressed and represented by something
in the manner in which the vibration is made - different from
the amplitude and, rate, but included within the amplitude.
8. That air vibrations can be taken -ipand reproduced by a
plate or diaphragm.
9. That plate or membrane vibrations, derived from air vibrations, can be made to prqduce in a conductor, electrical
changes corresponding to the air vibrations.
10. That by the use of an electro-magnet and a second plate,

Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

the electrical vibration will produce another air vibration, in
another place, corresponding to that which accompanied the
original sound; or, in other words, that vocal and other sounds
can be transmitted "telegraphically, by causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the

..

.

sounds" (Bell's fifth claim).

With these observations upon the state of the art before
1861, we may next give attention to Tne First Conception,of the Art of Transmitting 8peech by
Electricity.
Charles Bourseul, in 1854, published in a Paris journal his
belief that a spoken word could be transmitted by electricity,
and said:
"The thing is practicable in this way. We know that
sounds are made by vibrations, and are made sensible to the
ear by the same vibrations which are reproduced by the intervening medium.

.

.

Suppose a man speaks near a mov-

ing disk, sufficiently flexible to lose none. of the vibrations of
the voice; that this disk alternately makes and breaks the
connection with a battery; you may have at a distance
another disk which will simultaneously execute the same
vibrations.
"However this may be, observe that the syllables can only
reproduce upon the sense of hearing the vibrations of the
intervening medium Reproduce precisely those vibiiations,
and you will reproduce precisely those syllales. . . . I
have made somie experiments in this direction.

.

.

.

The

approximations obtained- pr 6 mise a favorable result."
Except that it is now doubtful whether in case of successful
speech transmission "this disk alternately makes and breaks
the connection," etc., the language of Bourseul is a precise and
complete statement of the law of operation expressed in and
patented by Bell's fifth claim.. One absolute condition is suggested by Bourseul, which is, with absolute fidelity, restated in
Bell's claim, as will be seen by placing them side by side in
the identical words of each author.

1854, Bourseul.
Bourseul is writing specifically of the transmission of
"speech," by electricity over a wire, and its reproduction by
suitable apparatus; and says:
"I have asked myself, for example, if the spoken word
itself could not be transmitted by electricity; in a word, if
what is spoken in Vienna may not be heard in Paris? . . .
The thing is practicable in this way: .
Then follows the suggestion of an apparatus which may be
sufficiently shown by the following electrical diagram"

"We know ..that sounds are made by vibrations
observe that the syllables can only reproduce upon the sense
of hearing" (i.e. at the distant receiving station of Vienna
and Paris) "the vibrations f the intervening medium (the line
wire) . . . reproduce precisely these vibrations" (i.e. the
original syllable vibrations) "and you will reproduce precisely
these syllables."
Reis and Bourseul Publications, page 3.
1876, Bell.
Bell is writing of the "electrical transmission" of "vocal
and other sounds," which terms, as we have seen, do not
necessarily include articulate speech; and says:
"I desire here to remark that there are many other uses to
hich these instruments may be put, such as the simultaneous
transmission of musical notes, differing in loudness as well as
pitch, and the telegraphic transmission of noises or sounds of
any kind" (Specification, Patent No. 17i,465).

tributions of Philipp Reis to the operative part of this art axe
added to the theoretical announcements of Bourseul.
We have no evidence that Bourseul ever constructed any
specific apparatus. His part in the evolution of this art consisted in recognizing and stating the rocess qf natutre, and
thus opening to invention the task of providing mechanical
arrangementsby which to avail of that process.
To bring the process thus dliscovered and stated, within the
control of man, was the work of invention. To reduce it to
practice was a mechanical problem. The success at present
attained is the joint achievement of Reis, Bell, Edison, Hughes,
Blake, and numerous others; most of whom have asked and
received patents for their specific devices. Bell alone has
asked a patent for the discovered process of nature which all
these invented devices serve; or in other words for achieving
the natural result at which the mechanical efforts are aimed.
Firstrealizationof the transmissionof speech and other sounds.
In 1861 Philipp Reis, at Frankfort, in Germany, published
to the world a paper, entitled "On Telephony by means of
the Galvanic Current," and exhibited an apparatus contrived,
as he expressly states, for the purpose of transmitting speech
and all other sounds. The acoustic principles involved are
carefully explained, and the subject with all its difficulties is
full spregtd before the scientific world by the question:
"Hiow, indeed, could a single instrument reproduce the
combined effect of all the organs occupied in human speech?
This was always the cardinal question; finally I got the
notion of putting the question in another way"How f our ear affected by the totality of vibrations produced by the organs of speech all simultaneously active? Or
more generally -

"lHow are we affected by the vibrations of several simultaneously sounding bodies ?"
The in-trument exhibited .-ransmitted (according to the
reports of the society to which the paper was read) melodies
And the sounds of various musical instruments audibly.

In the paper describing it Reis says:
"With the above principles as a foundation, I have succeeded
in constructing an apparatus with which I am enabled to
reproduce the tones of various instruments and even to a certain extent the human voice."
".Hitherto it has not been possible to reproduce the tones
of human speech with a distinctness safficient for every one.
The consonants are for the most part reproduced pretty distinctly, but the vowels as yet not in an equal degree."
The Rei.i-1egat Telephone of 1862.

OCTOBER TERI, 1887.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

So much, however, proves as completely as the most perfect
performance could do that the transmitter was intendedand in a degree, was able -to mould the current into the
forms of different sound vibrations. The instrument spoken
of was succeeded by modifications and improvements, so that
several forms of the Reis telephone were in existence as early
as 1864; and notably one which is described in a public journal
by V. Legat, Royal Prussian Telegraph Inspector, in 1863.
Concerning this instrument much testimony has been given,
all to the effect that it will transmit speech without adding to
or taking away any of its parts, merely by adjusting the pressure of the electrodes through means of a set screw and springs
with which it is provided, and the functions and uses of which
are explained.
The capacity of the Reis instruments to transmit speech is
supported by the sworn testimony of many of the most eminent physicists of this and other countries; and by various
witnesses of highest respectability in Germany who heard it
talk during the lifetime of Reis. None of the Reis instruments
are good telephones, as compared wiua the perfect instruments
of this day, but they a'e as good a the original Bell tehl)hone.
They are capable of being made good through the application
of the inventions of Hlughes, 1Rdison and others; upon which,
and not uj)on the In ventions of 3Pf,. Bell, the efficiency of the
telephone system used by the appellees depends. Their principle of operation when transmitting speech is a matter still
in dispute.
To overcome the effect of these -historical facts, appellees
have been (cMven to take positions as- follows:
1. That although -eis designed and wished to transmit
speech- he never succeeded in doing so.
"2. That he failed because his apparatus was "intended" to
make and break the circuit -and did so.
3. Ths t Bell .adopted the plan of a closed circuit, and by
that means succeeded.
These propositions are a mixture of truth and error, and
require examination and sifting.

Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Mfoleeular Telephone Co.

1. That although IBeis designed and wished to transmit speech,
he never succeeded in doing so.
To admit, as Prof. Cross does, that the Reis instrument
will speak now, and at the same time to deny that with all his
efforts to that end, the inventor made it speak in his time, in
view of unimpeached and highly responsible testimony -old
and new -to the contrary, has only boldness to commend it.
2. That he failed because his aparatus was "intended" to,
and did, make and break the circuit.
The supposed make and break element in the Reis instrument has been the crucial test upon which the courts below
have been able to disregard proven facts, and satisfy themselves by a shred of theory. Adopting the arguments of
counsel in the place of proof, Judge Lowell declares that:
"A century of Reis'would never- have produced a speaking
telephone by mere improvement in construction."
This was said in connection with a statement that:
"The deficiency was inherent in the priiciple of the machine. It can transmit electric waves along a wire, under
very favorable circumstances, not in the mode intended by the
inventor, but one suogested by Bell's discovery; but it cannot
transmute them into articulate sounds at the other end, because
it is constructed on a false theory.

"

There is a mischievous fallacy here which consists in imputing to Reis an "intention" that his instrument should make
and break the circuit anyhow, whether it succeeded in transmitting speech or not; and to the instrument itself a construction incompatible with any other mode of operation than
such make and break.
The evidence of an "intention" on the part of Reis is
derived from one or two expressions in his writings, which are
given, first, an interpretation contradictory.fto the real sense
of the whole; and second, an importance disproportionate to
their true significance. Honest construction of the few pages
which Reis has given us requires us to bear in mind, first, his
professed object, which was to transmit speech and all other
sounds; second, the construction of his transmitters (for rea%OT,. cxxvi-13

sons of space the Reis-Legat only is referred to), which exhibit
adjusting screws and springs so placed as to enable the operator to bring the electrodes together, and either render a separation impossible, or hold them in every degree of contact
down to an actual separation of their surfaces; third, that at
the time Reis wrote, many instruments of precision now in
existence for making electrical tests were wanting; fourth,
that the terminology of electrical science had not developed
into general use any words by which to express degrees of
make and break; fifth, that whether the instruments, did or
did not make and break was quite immaterial; and does not
affect the sufficiency of his instructions to enable a skilled
person to use his apparatus, or the legal efect of his 'writing..
as published anticipations of Bell's fifth claim, (as interpreted).

The quotation chiefly in use to establish the assertion that
he had built upon a wrong principle (Judge Lowell), or that
he made strenuous endeavors to prevent a continuity of circuit

(Prof. Cross), is found in his description of what he supposed
to be the operation of his instrument. To know what value
to give this description as evidence of the real fact, it should
be considered that the separation of surfaces for -1 of a second of time, and a space of 7-0-Gv of an inch would be sufficient to break a telephonic electrical current, as it is now usedIn the Frankfort lecture (Reis and Bourseul :Publications,
16), Reis, after stating the principles of acoustics in such a,
way as to include the general law above stated, viz.: that the
intervening media between a sound-producing cause and a
sound-perceiving organ must preserve all the original vibrations, said:

"With the above principles as a foundation, I have succeeded in constructing an apparatus with which I am enabled
to reproduce the tones of various instruments, and even to a
certain extent the human voice."
Then follows the clause in question:
"At the first condensation, the hammer-like wire d is
pushed back; at the rarefaction it cannot follow the retreating membrane and the current traversing the strip remains
broken until the membrane, forced by a new condensation

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

again presses the strip against d. In this way each soundwave causes a breaking and closing of the current."
Upon this is rested the bold assertion that Reis adopted as
the prncil)le of his machine that it must make and break the
current; and that he made " endecvol's to prevent" the current
from being continuous.

The language is before the court; the apparatus of the inventor and the principles of its construction are the subject of
observation; the witnesses in respect to its performance have
been heard.
It is seen to be an instrument of the class now universally
known as microphone; and its action is what is known as
microphonic action. Any two electrodes placed normally in
contact with a slight pressure, and forming part of a circuit
supplied with a current from a battery is a microphone. The
principle of the microphone is the principle of the loose joint.
The Blake transmitter is, up to this time, the most perfect and
sensitive of all the microphones, but its relation to the Reis
transmitter is genetic. t Whatever may be done by a Blake
transmitter may be done by a Reis transmitter; although
more care will be needed with the IReis and less certainty will
result; because the Blake is mechanically more perfect. The
principle of the two is the same. Their objects are the same.
Outline drawings of the workings of both are here shown. In
each of these as will be seen there is a loose contact between
the electrodes.

Reis-Legat Transmitter.

Blake Transmitter.

It is i the transmitterthat the principle u)on which,Bel's
broad claim is based does its work; _it is here that the current
is "moulded" into a "form similar," etc. The Blake transmitter has had the gQod fortune always to be mated with a
good receiver; and when it "moulds" well the receiver is its
witness.. The Reis transmitter was in its origin mated with
an insensitive and imperfect receiver. That receiver is doubtless chargeable with most of the failures to hear the words of
the transmitter. The moulded undulations, similar in form,
were there; but the receiver was inadequate to .retransform
them properly. When united to a good receiver the Reis
instrument, 'as is admitted by the appellees, will talk; thus
povwifq that a Reis transmitter is "an appwaatus" -and
wors by a ,,wthod"-cap)able of "transmitting vocal and
other sounds telegraphically, by causing electrical undulations
similar in form to the air vibrations," etc. Professor Cross
testifies:

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

"I have been able to transmit speech intelligibly by speaking gently into a Reis transmitter in circuit with a. Bell magneto receiver."
But "gentle" speaking, since 1876, is .forbidden, because,
notwithstanding 'Reis, in 1861, had hinted this condition by
saying:
"I was enabled to render audible to a large assembly (The
Physical Society of Fralikfort a.M.) melodies, which were
sung (not very loud) into the apparatus in another house three
hundred feet away" (Reis & Bourseul Publications, 17): still,
Judge Lowell says, in effect, that singing "not very loud"
is a "mode suggested by Bell's discovery." In short, in the
view of that judge, it is lawful to sing loud enough to fail, but
not gently enough to succeed.
Legat (Reis & Bourseul Publications, 33) is more .explicit
than Reis in the way of giving directions about adjustment,
&c. After describing the transmitter shown, he says:
"The Properlengths of the respective arms c e and e d of
this lever are regulated by the laws of the lever. It is advisable to make the arm c e longer than the arm e 1 in order that
the least motion at c may operate with greatest effect at d. It

From this it is made clear that Legat knew the electrodes

OCTOBER TERMI,

1887.

Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

Describing the supposed operation he says:
"The lever c d follows the movement of the membrane and
opens and closes the galvanic current at d g so that at each
condensation of the air in the tube, the circuit is opened, and
at each rarefaction the circuit is closed."
-"In consequence of this operation, the electro-magnet of the
apparatus in accordance with the condensations and rarefactions of the column of air in the tube a b . . .is eowres)ondingly demagnetized and magnetized, and the armature
of the magnet is set into vibrations like those of the membrane in the transmitting apparatus."
lie adds:
"In consequence of the imperfection of the apparatus at
this time, the minor differences of the original vibrations are
distinguishable with more difficulty; that is, the vowel sounds
appear more or less indistinct, - inasmuch as each tone depends not merely upon the number of vibrations of the
medium, but also upon its condensation and rarefaction."
"This also explains why chords and melodies were transmitted with marvellous accuracy, in the practical experiments
hitherto made, while single words in reading, speaking, etc.,
were less distinctly recognizable, although even in these the
inflections of the voice, as in interrogation, exclamation, surprise, calling, etc., were clearly reproduced."
"There is no doubt that the subject which we have been
considering, before it becomes practically valuable, for use,
will require considerable improvement; it will especially be
necessary to perfect the mectan ism of the apparatus to be
employed;
"

From all the foregoing it must be clear
(1) that all sounds are transmitted by means of electrical
undulations similar to their original vibrations; (2) that Legat
and Reis understood that in order to succeed in the transmission of sounds. none of tie vib 'ations belonging to the origipal
soand must be lost; (3) that they were under the impression
that the electrodes of the transmitter were separated with
each rarefaction of the air and that during that separation the
current ceased to flow; (4) that what they said was an ex-

pression of opinion, and not of intention; nor a declaration of
tie principle of the machine.
if continuity of circuit is requisite to transmit speech, then
the, means for preserving that continuity were provided by
Ieis and applied; and the proof that all sounds, including the
tones of the hmnan voice, and articulate speech, were transmitted, is proof that the needed continuity was preserved.
3. That Bell adopted the plan qf a closed ci'cuit and by that
9ean.? succeeded.
It is true that ]3ell adopted the idea of a closed circuit
which cannot be opened. That is shown in the drawing annexed to his patent, and the term "closed circuit" when used
i. the 1ritent, or when used in supporting its claims, must in
fairness be construed to gover, not a circuit like the microphone circuit of Reis or Blake (which may be closed or may
.be opend, according to the degree of power brought to bear
upon it), Lat a circuit like that of Fig. 7, which cannot by any
force whatever be opened.
That speech may be transmitted by such a closed circuit is
nbw known, though it was not experimentally known when
Bell tookout his patent, nor until a considerable time after.
That speech cannot be transmitted when the circuit is sometimes automatically opened and closed, cannot be proven.
The opinions of physicists differ. . The truth about that matter
is not so material as it would be if Reis had, as appellees
sophistically aver, based his claims to performance upon make
and break as a condition. The terrible force of logic upon the
necessities of the appellants' theory concerning the Reis instruments will be found in the evidence of Professor Cross.

131, 0., pp. 3956-7.
This testimony alone contain all which is required to d,.feat
.Bell's clair, to the discovery of a new art in &uch at sense a,9 to
entitle hin to a bfoad elaim.

The favorite definition by counsel of Mr. BelPs invention is
that he found out how to "mould" the electrical current into
the form of the air-waves, Manifestly this " nio u l ding" occurs in the transmitter: and the evidence that moulding has
taken place is that speech is heard. If, then, the Reis transmitter united with any receiver whatever, gives that evidence
that the transmitter has "moulded" the current, this is proof
that MAr. Bell is not the originator of this art of " moulding."
Upon this point the testimony of Prof. Cross recently taken
and read into this case by stipulation is instructive.
In former cases Prof. Cross had said:
"It is possible, with the Reis transmitter, to produce electrical undulations similar in form to the sound-waves producing them," and
"I do not deny the possibility that in !pite of the nldeavo;'s
"of R~eis to jI-mevent it, the circuit may have remained unbroken,

and some sounds have been transmitted by the production of
electrical undulations" (Dolbear Record, 508 and 515).

the relation of the parts to each other when at rest, but upon
the mode in which the instrument is used; is That correct?
"Ans. It is." The N. J. McDonough Record, pages 152,
153, et seq.

From which it clearly appears that a Reis transmitter runs
great risk of never being a Blake transmitter - in the hands
of complainant's experts! !
The proofs as they affect the Reis instruments nay be
summed up as follows:
1. Reis devised an apparatus which he called a telephone for
use in the transmission of language or words 1 (Tonspraohe);
the sounds of musical instruments; chords composed of simultaneously sounded notes, etc.
2. It is admitted that they were and are capable to transI The reiute care which has been devoted to adjusting all facts and !iterature so as to be harmonious with the appellee's case concerning Reis is
shown with respect to the translation of the word " Tonsprache" in the
Reis article of 1861.
That article made its appearance first in the Spencer case in 1981, where
Wonsprache " was translated as " speech." In the next- the DolbearT'
case, the article was (by stipulation between counsel) printed so as to substitute I-musical tones" for "speech" as the true translation of "Tonsprache." From. the latter case the exhibit has been adopted in subsequent
cases by stipulation, apparently without any revision of the translation, so
that the paper reads now " The extraordinary results . . . have .
raised the question if it might not be possible to transmnit musical ton"s theniselves (' speech itself' - ' Tonsprache ') to a distance."
The first translation is correct. See testimony of Bjerregaard, Molecular
Record, p. 673. 0., p. 1070, and the standard authority Lucas' German
)ictionary, Bremen, 1868, as follows:
Tonsprache-f., language, words (oppos. to Geberdensprache,jatmimu'),

mit musical tones having quality, in such a way that the instruments can be distinguished.
3. It is.proved that they did in the time of Reis, and will
now -transmit words and sentences.
4. It is admitted that the 'Reis transmitter will transmit
clearly and well when united to a good receiver.
5. It is proved that the Reis apparatus entire will "talk"
when carefully handled - and that it will talk well without the
addition of any element not already there, if slight changes
in the mechanical construction (by a varying of the stiffness
of springs, etc.) be made, and if the instruments be properly
adjusted.
6. It is proved by Prof. Cross that any instrument capable
to transmit any tone having quality is theoretically capable to
transmit articulate speech; from which it results that to make
it practically capable is a mechanical achievement, simply.
7. Whenever any transmitting telephone does actually transmit speech or any other sound possessing quality, it must necessarily have availed itself of some natural process in the line
wire; which is probably the same process whether the nnpulse be received from a magneto transmitter or from a variable resistance transmitter; and which process Mr. Bell, under
a name and description - the fitness of which appears as yet
incapable of verification - has set forth in his fifth claim.
Upon this state of facts concerning the history of the art;
and in view of the judgment below upholding the fifth claim
because Mr. Bell is supposed to have discovered and announced
in it a new art, to wit, "the new art of speech transmission,"
it now becomes material to consider certain legal questions.
1. WVhat "isan, art, in, the sense of the patent law ?
2. When may an art be I'eytalded as discovered in contemnlation (f law?

3. Who discovered the "art" portion of the practical business of speech and other sound transmission?
To conceive that a new thing can be done; to indicate in a
correct though general way the laws of nature which must be
availed of; to create suitable apparatus-- although suitable
only in a limited degree; to use the apparatus and succeed in

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

the avowed purpose- though only in a limited degree; to
publish the result with sufficient specification to reveal the
whole purpose, and put the world fairly upon further inquiry,
appears to result in the production of a new art, and t'o take
the doing of that special thing out of the category of undiscovered arts.
From that stage, in the development of that art, it would
seem that invention and discovery must be deemed limited to
the improvoment and perfecting of old or the invention of
new, modes of mechanism.
This difference between the discovery of an art and the perfected price thereof is what the court is called on in this case
to clearly distinguish.
The error below has in part consisted in the apparently unconscious assumption of a false premise, viz., that the art of
transmitting speech was undiscovered in 1876, because no good
way of practising it had yet been worked out.
As to the Specieo Art of Electric Telephony or Speech
Tansmissian.
It appears clearly that the art of sound transmission is one
art, the principles of which are in no wise changed or varied
on account of the special sound to be transmitted.
It would then appear that there was not a special art of
speech transmission left to be discover~d after the general art
of tone transmission was known.
Examining the works and considering the language of Reis,
it appears that he set to himself and to the world a problem in
this form:
How shall we mechanically take up and control the air
vibrations accompanying any sound or sounds, and by their
own energy create electrical actions corresponding to them;
and afterwards by the energy of these electrical actions create
other air vibrations which shall be so like the first as to produce in the organ of hearing the sensation of tone which
woumd have been produced in it by the original sound or
sounds?
The problem was mechanical.

OCTOBER TERM,

1887.

Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephie Co.

He essayed an answer to this mechanical problem by a
variety of devices.
There is not a scintilla of proof that Reis ever tried to break
or not to break the vurent. lie tried to speak so as to be
lieatd. The consequence of such speech to the current, he left
to nature and the automatic action of the instrument.
The words, the "little hammer,
camnot follow,"
etc., had reference only to tMe Bored Block trans-m.itterof 1861,
and was Pever repeated in respect to the subsequent "cubical
box" or Legat forms.
3fake and Break and Continuous Current.
Xr. Lowrey urged that it is a moot question whether absolute continuity of current is requisite to speech transmission;
saying that it is not proved that speech cannot be transmitted
when the curent is intermittent; and therefore that the fact
of transmission by a current capable of being broken does not
prove that it has at all times remained continuous.
It is undoubtedly proved that something occurs in the electrical field which has an agency in the reproduction of sounds.
*Wrhether it is some variation of the intermolecular relations of
the conducting medium brought about by attaching the conductor to a source of electricity; or some change in the tension. of whatever is the product of the battery or nagnet, and
therefore called electrical: or whether it is some other occult
process as yet not recognized, which results in allowing motion
to be tansferred and reproduced is not known.
Mr. Bell has taken a step forward and given the nauwe of
"electrical undulations similar in form" to that something
which occurs. Having thus embodied and personified the
theory in an .expression. he has taken a patent for the expression and is now in position to restrain all transmission of speech
upon the ground that when it is transmitted, "undulations
similar in form," &c., are caused, and his idea thereby infrii ged.
That- Mr. Bell -and his experts are wrdng, and that the
proxinate cause of speech transmission may hereafter jbe
found to be. vot the similarityin,for of the undulations, etc.,

is not only not impossible, but in view of the many instances
in which scientific theories as reasonable and as strongly

upheld as the present undulatory theory of electricity have
proved untrue, is not highly improbable.
One thing, however, is certain, that the words "as herein

ehitcqretation, of the 5th Claim ,'esults
Bell's Prevent Broad
in a Jfonopoly f a AScintifC Fact or Law qt" atiwe.
There 9,emains still the important quetion- granting all
which is claimed in the patent to be novel, liozo m uch is patentable invention, or discovery, and how ;,bueh ,is vnpatentablt
discovery of scientific facts or laws of nature.
This brings us to the consideration of Tilyhman v. Proctor,
and other process cases; and O'Reilly v. JJorse.
In one of the cases on appeal (the Dolbear case) the court
says :
"There can be no patent for a mere principle. The discoverer of a iuwturalforce or a scientific fact cannot have a
patent for that."
But it proceeds to make this exception nugatory by confounding the natural process (or scientific fact) with the invented process for working the apparatus; sustaining the
patent for the last upon a construction which blindly sweeps
in the first:
"The evidence in this case clearly shows that Bell discovered that articulate sounds could be transmitted by undulatory
vibrations of electricity, and invented THE way or _process of
transmitting such sounds by means of such vibrations. If
THAT art or process . . . is . . . the only way by
which speech can be transmitted by electricity. that fact does
not lessen the merit of his invention or the protection which
the law will give it. .
S .. The essence of his invention consists not merely
in the form'of apparatus which he uses, but in the general
process or method of which that apparatus is the embodiment."

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telcphone Co.

"Whatever name may be given to a property or. manifestation of electricity in'the defendant's receiver, the facts remain
that they availed themselves of Bell's discovery that Undulatory vibrations of electricity can intelligibly and accurately
transmit articulate speech as well as of tie process which Bell
invented, and by which he reduced his discovery to practical
use."
As interpreted, therefore, by the court and the counsel who
uphold it, the fifth claim is a claim for the electrical transimission of speech under the form of a pretended description of
how nature does it! Having found that a result happens, and
gruessed at the explanation, Bell patented the guess; and
dvidence that the effect has been attained is permitted to
prove that his conjectural method is infringed.
In fact, what 1Mr. Bell discovered - assuming now the novelty of his work and accepting his formula as a conventional
way of expressing the conception of science, about somethiqg
which happens- was, not that electrical undulations can (as
if there were some choice on the part of the inventor), but
that they do, transmit sounds by conforming themselves to tlte
characteristics of the energy which creates the sound -and
that they will do this in no other way.
This is a scientific fact.
If his theory is true, and his claim to originality gen'uine, he
had detected a secret of nature; and had found out how from
the energy of motion in ordinary matter (sound) she 'sets up
equivalent action (undulations) in the molecular, magnetic or
electrical states of a conductor, and afterwards causes the force
or- energy to emerge from that intermediate state or form of
nlnifestation into its original form.
In fact, he has merely reasoned on the subject, and has not,
in any true sense, "discovered" anything.
In other words, "Mr. Bell thinks h'e has discovered that the
law of the persistence or correlation of forces holds good in its
application to this subject.
Having so reasoned, he proceeded promptly: to patent, not
only'a particular method and apparatus for availing of that law,
but also the 'ight to avail of that law by any means whatever.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

Thus considered he has been able to monopolize a naturalforce, and ?atent a scientific fact.
To show how clearly this case is within the reasoning used
in the case of O'Reilly v. .lorse, 16 How., let us drop the middle term in the fifth claim and read it as follows: "5. The
method of, and apparatus for, transmitting telegraphically
substantially as set forth" (i.e.
.
vocal or othier sounds
in a circuit specially
and
listening
the process of speaking
arranged). Does the middle term thus left out describe anything discovered by Mr. Bell, in the sense of the patent law?
If electricity undulates, Mr. Bell did not invent that action.
As the claim stands, interpreted, therefore, it is pure and simple for the action of electricity whenever and in whatever
manner it transmits sounds.
Suppose Mr. Morse had learned or surmised that electricity,
when employed in transmitting signals, gains heat or color,
and is gray, or blue, or .ed, and had said "I claim not only an
apparatus by which electricity can be put into a heated, or
colored state, but I claim electricity whenever it is hot or
colored in the act of transmitting."
In what sense would this be different from his disallowed
eighth claim, - if it is only in and by the predicated conditions that electricity performs its work?
In short, Air. Bell's way of claiming this law of nature is
the way of Mforse in his famous, disallowed eighth claim, disguised only by the turn of a phrase. Morse claimed the use
of electricity for transmitting signals, and this was disallowed.
Bell claims the use of electricity w,/en undulating in correspondence with air vibrations and transmitting sounds. Since
electricity will not transmit, except by undulating, the claim is
in effect broadly for the use of electricity when transmitting.,
The Morse fifth claim, which was sustained, was for the
system of dots and dashes, - an arbitrary and conventionalarrangement by which ideas were conveyed. Morse, and the
world kmowing already that the flow of a current could be
interrupted and renewed, invented a certain order of interruption and renewals which would produce certain signals, the
meaning of which could be fixed by agreement. This was an
VOL. cxxv-14

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

artificial thing, and as such signals could be indefinitely varied.
and the doing this was wholly the conception of his mind, he
was given a patent for breaking up a current into any recognized succession of interruptions and renewals.
But the undulations of a current in the act of transferring
mechanical movements of air particles is a natural system.
Nobody wants it to undulate. It will undulate automatically
when spoken to in certain right ways -of which Bell has one
and the defendant another. The discovery of this fact belonged to the same class which the biologist makes, when,
looking more and more closely into nature, he learns the
process of ovation and germination.
To allow a.patent claim for such a discovery might be likened to a clain'for raising wheat by the germination of the seed:
leaving miankindfee to produce wheat by all other methods!
[The FiMFft as a Process Claim.
The argumntsfor sustaining the fifth as a claim to the
.process of trahsmitting sounds by causing electrical undulation; without reference to the means, has -no support in the
doctrine of Tilghman 'v. Proctor, or any of the process cases.
:Mr. Lowrey argued, that in all the cases upholding a claim
for a process, the process was one capable of being sensually
perceived, verified and proved by oath -not as a matter of
opinion, but as a matter of fact. That the process of transmission by undulations is plausible, and probably true; but is
not proven; that we have merely adopted a term to signify
something which happens, but the true nature of which remains as yet undiscovered; that the plausibility of the theory
implied in the name, cannot justify a court of law in treating
the theory as a proven fact, and sufficient basis for legal judgment affecting rights ; that the theory of Sir Isaac Newton concern ing the emission of light was no less plausible and remained
for generations the accepted theory of the scientific world; yet
now it is without a single believer. In the Tilghman case, for
instane, the specifications say: "My invention consists of
(1) a process for (2) producing free fat acids," &c.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Lowrey's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

Suppose the inventor had surmised some hidden chemical
action as being a step in the operation; and, having obtained a
patent for producing, etc., by causing that chemical. operation,
had insisted upon preventing all persons "from producing free
fat acids," etc., by any means whatever, on the ground that the
fact of production proves that his unseen and patented chemical process has occurred. We should then have a case analogous to this.
But that is not the case of Tilghaan v. Proctor, 102 U. S.
707.
In Tilghman's specification the process is set out as follows:
"I subject these fatty oily matters to the action of water at a
,high temperature and pressure," etc.
The court in interpreting the patent, says (p. 708) : that it
"is for a process of separating their component parts so as to
render them better adapted to the use of the arts."
The claim was the manufacturing of fat, acids and glycerine
from fatty bodies, by the action of water at a higk temrperatuzre
alndressure.
There was a process, all of which lay within ordinary means
of observation and verification; being thus wholly unlike in
material respects to the supposed process of creating undulations in a continuous current, which is Bell's claim.
It is believed, therefore, that so much of the fifth claim as
by any construction is capable to be extended to the transmission of speech, should be expressly limited to what is accomsound before
plished by uttering -" as herein described "-the

do, I shall then endeavor to take up his patents and consider
the construction of his patent in view of his work. After
which will follow the discussion of some questions relating to
the validity of those patents.
]Prior to the autumn of 1873 Bell had become impressed
with the importance of discovering a means to enable telegraphic companies to transmit more than one message at the
same time over the same wire. Ile had formed some theories
of his own on the subject of multiple telegraphy (as we call
that branch of telegraphy by which many messages may be
transmitted over one wire at the same time) and his thoughts
and theories led him to the subject of the harmonic telegraph;
that is, to use a transmitter which should vibrate at certain
specified rates per second, and, by means of electrical currents,
cause the receiver to vibrate at the same number of rates per
second; and then those receivers, acting through an old law,
well known to musicians, would each pick out the number of
vibrations, or the rate of vibrations, which was sent by the
transmitter attuned to their own tune, and not attuned to any
other. While thus occupied, he fell in with the Bourseul
article. It taught him, as Mr. Lowrey has already explained,
that if you make a sound upon a diaphragm, you set that diaphragm into vibration, and thereby cause it to interrupt a current of electricity, making and breaking the current, and you
will obtain at the other end of the line vibrations which will
correspond. at least in rate per second, or in pitch of the sound,
to the vibrations of the transmitter, and of the sound actuating the transmitter. Bourseul had stated his belief that upon
that principle an electric transmission of speech could be
secured, although he had not secured it himself, as appears by
the article. He no longer had to beat his own way for the
discovery, or to think of the law; for Bourseul's article pointed
out the law to him; and the great law, the foundation law of
the whole science and art was simply this, that you must have

OCTOBER TERM,

Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

a transmitter at one end - a connecting line- and a receiver
at the other end; that you must have your transmitter so
arranged that it would vibrate in exact response to the vibration of the sound waves; and that you must connect your receiver to it by currents so operating that the receiver would
vibrate in the same exact relation to the sound waves. Then
you would produce the same vibrations in the receiver that
your sound produced in the transmitting diaphragm. You
must necessarily have precisely the same sounds. That was a
statement of the law of the telephone.
Before the winter of 1874-5, certainly before February,
1875, he had become acquainted with Reis's inventions. From
this source, also, he learned that you must primarily use a
diaphragm, a vibrating disc or membrane, so arranged that it
would take up and respond to all motions of the air, and he
further learned: (1) That you must have a receiver which will
execute vibrations identical with the air vibrations made at the
transmitter: (2) That the mechanism must be arranged so as
to produce both the rate of vibration, and the varying amplitude of it, in order to transmit speech: and (3)That Reis had
endeavored to carry out these principles in the construction of
his apparatus.
lie further learned from Reis to represent this mathematically, by drawing curves representing the sounds. He found
in the articles of :Reis full mathematical curves representing
the various vibrations. He found the different parts of the
curves described. He found a zero line representing the air as
still, and rises of the curve above that zero line representing
.the condensation, or the forward movement of the air particles, forcing them a- ong each other, and then the descent of
that curve line below the zero line representing the rarefaction
of the air below its normal point, and so on. He also found
that iReis had represented composite curves, made up of other
curves, to show how various sounds could be made, and that
they would all coalesce and form resultant curves, which can
be represented in the same way or by algebraically adding
those curves -adding both together when they are both plus,
sul tracting when some are minus, and adding when both are
minus. Reis states this general principle very clearly thus:

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Hill's Argument for P'eople's and Ovcrland Cos.

Every sound and every combination of sounds, on
strikino our ear cause vibrations of the drum of the ear that
may be represented by a curve.
, coD. The course of these vibrations simply gives us a
conception (appr&iation) of the sound, and every alternation
changes the conception (apprfciation).
"As soon, then, as it is possible to produce, anywhere and
in any manner, vibrations whose curves shall be the same as
those of any sounds or combination of sounds, we shall receive
the same impression as that tone or conmbination of tones
would have produced on us."
This wis the general information which Bell had when he
.entered upon the study of the possible transmission of speech
vibrations of sound. By these publications his vigorous and
logical mind was directed to the very-point to be investigated;
the air vibrations, the motions of the particles of the air in
the transmission of sound. Bourseul had not accomplished this
transmission. The results achieved by Reis were defective.
Consonantal sounds had been satisfactorily transmitted ; vowel
sounds not so well; words indistinctly.
Bell was well acquainted with the scientific theories on this
is caused by vibratsubject. Sound created by vocal organs vibration

it is, a back-and-forth movement. All sound consists primarily in the movement of air particles forward and back
from the source of sound. Without this vibration there is no
sound. The rate at which the air particles travel back and
forth - that is, the number of movements per second - determimne whether the sound is high or low. The upper notes
of Patti, for instance, vibrate the air about fifteen hundred
times per second; a heavy basso note about eighty tims per
second. One further characteristic, namely, the force or the
distance through which the vibration occurred, distinguishes
one sound from another. This difference in violence, in amplitude, determines the loudness of the sound.
Bell hmew this, and understood that in order to reproduce
a sound at a distance he must reproduce the vibratior and
must have the power to vary and copy both its rate and its

OCTOBER TERM,. 1887.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

amplitude. Those three characteristics, he said, constitute
every sound; their difference represents the difference between
one sound and another, and therefore I must reproduce those
characteristics at the other end of the line.
This theory drove him to one particular kind of electric current-the induced magneto current. Reis had endeavored to
copy those vibrational characteristics in his receiver, but had
not thought of copying them in the current between the transmitter and the receiver. Bell saw that in order to copy them
in the receiver, they must be got into the current which was
the connecting medium. That led him to the magneto current, because that is the only form of current in which an electrical copy of the movement can be obtained. He saw that
if he'could take an armature, attach it to the diaphragm, and
place it in front of an electro-magnet, and then speak to the
diaphragm, that armature would be set in vibration, and the
vibration would necessarily correspond to the sound waves, to
the movement of the air particles back and forth, in every
respect; and that, as it pushed the current, as long as it was
moving in one way, and with violence proportioned to the
violence of its movement in that way, and pulled it when it
was moved back the other way, the current would necessarily be an exact copy, in electricity, of the aerial movement,
and hence the receiver at the other end of the line would
respond (being pulled by the current, or pushed by it) exactly,
by copying the motions of the transmitting diaphragm, if the
apparatus were properly constructed. As early as the autumn
of 1874, as he tells us, 4e conceived, in a crude way, of the
apparatus which he shows in -ig. 7 of his patent. But he
thought that the movement of the armature by the infinitesimal changes of air in the sound waves would be so small that
the inductive force created on the line would, not amount to
anything. He was so well satisfied of this that he did not
take the trouble to find out how he should attach the armature or connect the diaphragm.
On the 2d of June, 1875, while experimenting with his multiple telegraph, he obtained an accidental result in the transmission of sound, which induced farther experiments in that

direction. Instruments substantially like those in Fig. 7 of
the patent were constructed; and he suspended other work in
order to see whether he could create a vibration which would
be sufficient to reproduce the same motions at the other end
of the line. The experiments continued through July, 1875,
and resulted in failure. The experiment in which he produced"
for the first time distinctly audible effects through this apparatus was made in April, 1876, after the date of his patent.
The whole history of his experimentation before the issue of
the patent is condensed into the month of July, 1875; and if
your Honors can determine what he did in that month, you
will have determined exactly what he did prior to the date of
his first patent.
His letter to Hubbard of August 14, 187.5- shows that he
had abandoned the experiments, disgusted and disheartened:
He says: "On glancing back over the line of electrical experiments, I recognize that the discovery of a magneto-electric
current generated by the vibration of the armature of, an
electro-magnet in front of one of the poles, is the most important point yet reached. I believe that it is the key to still
greater things. The effects produced, though slight in themselves, appear to me so great in proportion to their cause, that
I feel sure that the future will discover means of utilizing currents obtained in this way on actual telegraph lines. So
important does it seem to me to protect the idea that I think
some steps should be taken immediately towards obtaining a
caveat or patent." For what? "For the use of a magnetoelectric current, whether obtained in the way stated above
(by the vibrati6n of permanent magnets, in front of electromagnets) or in any other way. I shbuld wish to protect it
specially as a means of transmitting simultaneously musical
notes differing in intensity as well as in pitch. I can see
clearly that the magneto-electric current will not only permit
of the actual copying of spoken utterance, but of the simultaneous transmission of any number of musical notes (hence
messages) without confusion."
Then, further down, he says: "When we can create a pulsatory action of the current," - he had not then created it, -

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

which is the exact equivalent of the aerial impulses, we shall
certainly obtain exactly similar results."
Then he ends the letter with this: "Don't you think it
would be well to take out a caveat for the use of the magnetoelectric current? In its present undeveloped state, it might
be unwise to let Gray know anything about it, unless, indeed,
we could secure the principle of it in a patent." Thus he
announced his purpose in advance to patent the principle without waiting to invent the mechanical naeans for its. application.
In December, 1875, he went to Canada to induce Mr. George
Brown of Toronto to take out in Europe patents for the invention which he was to patent here. Upon the 28th of
December he gave Brown a memorandum on which he had
made a sketch of which the following is a fac-simile.

,"

Your Honors will see that the sketch is a copy of Fig. 7 of
the patent. This is an admission that at that time he had
not been able to obtain a word of articulate speech. He had
heard nothing himself; his electrical assistant had been able
to hear only faint sounds.
Now,we have got down to the point where Mr. Bell got a
patent. We have found what he-did and what he did not do,
what he thought was the true plan or principle of a telephone
and the only plan at the time of taking out that patent, and
now we have got the patent. - Let us see what that says.
This patent describes two inventions. It is entitled, "A
patent for an improvement in telegraphy," and I think there
is considerable force in the argument that the entire patent

TELEPHONE CASES.
*Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

may be construed as a patent for multiple telegraphy. But I
shall assume the most favorable construction that I can possibly place upon the intention, the meaning of Mr. Bell, in procuring this patent, - a construction that is substantially the
construction of his counsel, so far as the facts and the language of the patent are concerned, -and shall endeavor to
show that upon that assumption it is limited to the magnetoelectric current, and the magneto-electric apparatus described
in it. The patent contains long statements as to undulatory
currents, for the purpose of operating multiple telegraph
instruments. Multiple telegraph instruments have nothing
to do with the quality of sound, nothing to do with the form
of the vibrations. It is sufficient for multiple telegraph purposes that there be a vibration at such a rate per second.
That we all agree to. Hence so far as this patent discusses the
form of the sound waves, or the form of the electric movements, that is distinct from multiple telegraphy.
The patent describes or refers, first, to some prior inventions,
for which he had filed applications for patents before. It then
states the advantages, derivable from the undulatory current
generally, advantages that belong to multiple telegraphy. It
states five advantages, all five of them being multiple telegraph advantages, having nothing to do with the transmission
of speech - but all having reference to his multiple telegraph;
and I assume for the purposes of this discussion that he had
sufficiently demonstrated his multiple telegraph to be able
-to patent that. Then he states certain electric facts and
describes his multiple telegraph apparatus. He had exhibited
it, particularly in Fig. 5 of the patent drawings. He had
exhibited one of his multiple telegraph instruments separately.
In Fig. 6 he had shown how he coupled them together on the
line in pairs, so that they would send more than one message
over the wire at the same time. He states here exactly the
theory why they will do it: they will do it by undulatory
current represented by curved lines. in his prior applications
le says his currents were simply make and break currents,
which could not be represented by curved lines. They were
represented by dots and dashes like the M[orse alphabet. Now

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
M1r. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

he does not, eVen. for his multiple telegraph purposes, propose
to break the current, but he proposes to vary the force of
it or strength of it for his multiple telegraph purposes. He
proposes to undulate the current, cause it to vibrate, but make
those vibrations continuous. In that way the movements will
be represented by curved lines and the movements never will
overlap or interfere with each other or suppress each other.
There may be half a dozen of those movements, each represented by a curved line, and the united result of, all of them
on the line will be represented by a single curved line, which
will be the resultant of the other curves. He explains that
theory very fully, and then he describes his apparatus at
Fig. 1, which he is apparently attempting, to show as an
apparatus for copying in electricity the movements of the air.
I assume for the purposes of this discussion that Fig. T was
an attempt to represent an apparatus, a diagram of the apparatus that he had tested the gummer before, and was intended
to illustrate his sound copying theory, and the patent states
clearly his sound copying theory and claims that theory, that
principle, as he had proposed to do in his letter to Hubbard.
He says, "It has long been known that when a permanent
magnet is caused to approach the pole of an electro-magnet a
current of electricity is induced in the coils of the latter, and that
when it is made to recede a current of opposite polarity tothe
first appears upon the wire." The polarity means a current of
an opposite direction appears on the line. "When, therefore,
a permanent magnet is caused to vibrate in front of the pole
of an electro-magnet, an undulatory current of electricity is
induced in the coils of the electro-magnet, the undulations of
which correspond, in rapidity of succession, to the vibrations
of the magnet, in polarity to the direction of its motion, and
in intensity to the amplitude of its -iI-ation."
And further on he says, "Electrical undulations induced
by the vibratiouL of a body capable of inductive action"can be represented graphically, without
inductive vibration
error, by th6 same sinusoidal curve-which expresses the vibration of the ihducing body itself, and the effect of its vibration
upon the air; for, as above stated, the rate of oscillation in
-"

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

the electrical current corresponds to the rate of vibration of
the inducing body-that is, to the pitch of the sound produced. The intensity of the current varies with the amplitude
of the vibration, that is, with the loudness of the sound; and
the polarity of the current corresponds to the direction of the
vibrating body-that is, to the condensations and rarefactions of air produced by the vibration. Hence," he says, for
these three reasons, "the sinusoidal curve A or B, Fig. 4, represents graphically the electrical undulations induced in a circuit
by the vibration of a body capable of inductive action.
"The horizontal line aief,etc., represent the zero of current.
The elevations b b 6, etc., indicate impulses of positive electricity," - electricity going in one direction on a lifie, - "the
depressions o co, etc., show impulses of negative electricity," the current going the other way, - "the vertical distance b d
or of of any portion of the curve from the zero line expresses
the intensity of the positive or negative impulse at the part
observed, and the horizontal distance a a indicates the duration
of the electrical oscillation."
Now, there could be no clearer statement than. that, that
this vibratory current, tnis undulatory current, is to have
three characteristics. It necessarily has three characteristics
when it is excited by the induction of a vibrating body of inductive metal. And further, that that current itself and that
alone can be represented by curves which contain elements
representing those three characteristics. No other currents in
the world, no variable resistance current, no current such., as
comes from the IReis instrument, or from the Blake transmitter, or from a wire dipped in liquid, could possibly contain
those three characteristics:, because a variable resistance current does not flow back and forth on the line, does not change
polarity; but simply moves in one direction, always on the
line. The description which he gives of this undulatory current, with its three characteristics, is therefore necessarily limited to the one magneto-electric current, and cannot be applied to the variable resistance.
Having made those statements about the character of the
current, he proceeds to describe the instrument, Figure 7,

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

which our friends tell us is a telephone instrument, and which
I admit is a diagram placed there to illustrate this theory of
his about these back and forth currents, the principle which
he is trying to claim, as he said in his letter of August 14th.
He says:
"The armature o, Fig. 7, is fastened loosely by one extremity
to the uncovered leg -d, of the electro-magnet b, and its other
extremity is attached to the centre of a stretched membrane a.
A cone, A, is used to converge sound vibratiois upon the
membrane. When a sound is uttered in the cone, the membrane a is set in vibration, the armature c" - you will see this
is a magneto-electric device, it is an induction device, worked
by an armature as a power- "the armature c is forced ta
partake of the motion, and thus electrical undulations are created upon the circuit E b cfg. These undulations are similar
in form to the air vibrations caused by the sound" - there is
a controlling and decisive statement in the patent bearing

upon the construction of the patent. "These undulations are
similar in form to the air vibrations caused by the soundthat is, they are represented graphically by similar curves that is the reason why he calls them similar in form.
There is no controversy here as to the first four claims.
The fifth, which the other side says is a telephone claim, and
which I regard as a claim for the use of the magneto-electric
current, is as follows:
"The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or
other sounds telegraphically, as herein described, by causing
electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the.
air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds."
He could not claim in that claim all undulations. That,
would be equivalent to the eighth claim of Morse, which this.
court refused to sustain, for electric currents were known. He
could not even claim that it was any particular kind of electric
current. It must be defined. This court would never allow
any man to claim an electric current produced by any apparatus, unless he defined that current specifically by its very characteristics,- so that it could be distinguished from all other
currents. Now, by what characteristics did Mr. Bell define.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

that current? He did define it. Why, he says, it is "by causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of
the air accompanying the vocal sounds." That is the kind of
current. This current, produced by substantially this apparatus, must be a current which is in undulation, and the undulations must be similar in form to the air movements. When is
a current similar in form? "Similar in form" means that the
electrical undulations vibrate forward and back on the line
just as the air particles vibrate forward and back; that they
vibrate forward and back at the same rate per second, and
that they vibrate with varying amplitude, back and forth, just
the same. When they do that they can be represented graphically by the same curve. When they do not, they cannot.
When they do it they come within the terms of his claim;
when they don't do it, they don't come within the terms of
his claim. The claim is a claim for a current. The specification describes a current, describes that form of current having
those three characteristics. It is that current, when created
by that mechanism or its equivalents, as shown in Figure 7 -

that inductive mechanism.
There is no difference between counsel as to the meaning of
the terms employed by Bell to describe the currents. An
intermittent current is normally constant on the line, flowing
in one direction from a battery. If at some point you break
that wire and then holdl it in your hand or attach it to a key5
so that you can change it and connect it, you will break the
current, you will create current impulses which are separated
by little intervals of non-current, and that is what he calls the
intermittent. 'He distinguishes the pulsatory current thus.
Suppose you take the same continuous current, and attach in
some way another battery, or some other means of increasing
the force of the current, by which means you increase it in
stantly, not gradually, so that, when you touch a key you
throw on that current, which is already moving over the line,
a sudden electrical impulse, and that continues until you raise
the key, and then it instantly stops, that would be what he
calls the pulsatory current. The intermittent is a broken current; the pulsatory a suddenly increased or decreased current

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

without change of direction; the undulatory current is a gradual change, represented by a curve.
Undulatory currents may be of two kinds. They may gradually change without reversing the polarity, without changing
their direction. For instance, a current that is an intermittent
current, if you take off the intermitting apparatus, and simply
apply something which would gradually change the amount
of the current; for instance, suppose you passed it through a
wire, dipped through a liquid, having a liquid in the circuit,
then when you raise the wire, so that the current has to travel
a long distance through the liquid, you get a good deal of resistance, the current would not go so freely through the liquid.
If you gradually depress the wire, the current has a shorter
distan to travel through tie liquid, it goes through more
freely and it will increase the current. That would be graduallV done, but it would be all in the same direction. On the
other hand, if you take an electro-magneto apparatus, take a
body of inductive material and vibrate it in front of the poles
of an electro-magnet, when it is magnetized and in a circuit,
then you get another form of undulatory current, not the
variable resistance form, which is always going in one direction, and simply increasing and decreasing in quantity, so as
to undulate in that sense- not that, but you get another form
of undulatory current, to wit, a current that vibrates in direction as well as increases and decreases in electro-motive force;
like the waves of the sea beating against a rock. There is an
undulation and a constant propulsion and retraction of water
against a rock, forward and backward. And while he describes in this patent that all forms of undulations may be
used, it does not make any difference what kind of undulatory
current it is, whether it is the variable resistance current or
this magneto current, so far as multiple telegraph purposes
are concerned, yet only one of those forms can be used for
sound copying.
The effects of electrical currents closely resemble the effects
of fluids in motion. The water in a waterpipe coming to a
common washstand can be turned on or off, or the amount of
its flow regulated bt turning the spigot. No reversal of direc-

TELEPHONE CASPQ
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

tion of the water in the pipe takes place. It flows in one
direction from its source to its place of discharge. If I alternately turn it on and off, I produce an intermittent current.
If I close it gradually and partially, and then open it in the
same way, I make a current with a variable resistance. When
I turn the valve around so that there is a straight hole through
the valve, then the current runs through with its full force,
there is nothing interposed in its way. When I turn the valve
around so there is no hole at all to it, tii, n the resistance is
such as to shut the current off altogether; but when I turn
it partially around, the fluid cannot get through, it is partially
cut off. There is a resistance interposed. In the variable
resistance transmitter, there is just such a gate. I might liken
it to one of these doors which open here. A current of wind
is flowing in the summer season through these doors and is
refreshino us with its coolness. The servant stands by the
door and opens that door and lets more of it flow, or closes it
to let less of it flow. He varies the resistance to the current,
but more or less flows through. Now, with the electrical conduit, where the wire represents the pipe or the doorway, and
where something is interposed that represents the door or the
cock in the pipe, we have precisely similar operations. Let us
take the Blake transmitter as an illustration. In the Blake
transmitter we have a wire coming up to the vibrating diaphragmn, running over on the diaphragm to the centre or running through a spring which is operated by the diaphragm, to
the centre of the diaphragm ; there it has contact with a piece
of carbon and from the other side of the carbon there goes off
another wire that goes to the line. The current comes in from
the line and comes around through the diaphragm to that
piece of carbon, struggles through the carbon, because carbon
is a resistance to it; carbon is not a good conductor, the current has difficulty in getting through. if the carbon was too
thick it would have great difficulty; the carbon has to be proportioned so as not to offer too much resistance; but the
current meets and struggles through that carbon and goes off
the line. Now the nature of carbon is such that while it is true
that in its normal condition and not under 1resstpre, it offers a
VOL. CXxvi-15

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

very considerable resistance to the passage of the current, to the
flow of that current, just as the valve would when half closed,
yet if we press that carbon a little it brings an infinite number
of molecules in such a relation to each other, that the current
leaps through it more readily. The slightest pressure on it
will enable the current to pass through more easily than it did
before the door was open. The door is opened in the carbon
telephone by pressure upon the carbon, and the current passes
through without obstruction, and it is opened by the slightest
movement upon the carbon.
[In response to a request from the bench, -Mr. Hill here
explained how it was that the Blake transmitter operated
differently in principle from the original transmitter of Bell,
and continued:]
Bell's counsel agree that he contemplated that the electrical
movements would be an exact copy of the movements of the
air particles. He worked out by a line of reasoning, that such
must be the form of current. Though his experiments failed,
he still remained of that opinion. Writing to Hubbard he
said, "If we can get the exact equivalent of. aerial impulses
we shall certainly get exactly similar results; therefore we
must patent or caveat this magneto-electrical current " saying it five times over, limiting it every time by the
"magneto-electric," no other form; then going to his patent
and describing why it is limited to the magneto-electric;, it
must copy the form of the air vibrations, he says in his claim;
and explaining on the page before that what he, means by
copying the form. It must copy the form when you can
describe its movements by graphic descriptions which will be
the same; going back four pages and stating when you can
graphic curves which will be the same, to wit,
describe it in,
when it moves back and forth, we have a clear statement
in his.patent that the 5th claim of the patent is limited to that
specific form of current, the magneto-electric current. In
other words, that the patent is and was for precisely the
thing that he stated in his letter of August 1-, 1875, that
he was going to make it- a patent for the use of the magnetoelectric current, and nothing else. INow does that patent cover

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

the defendants' instrmnents here, or any of them? The defendants' instruments are all variable resistance instruments; they
are all carbon instruments, in which the current is varied in
amount as it passes through the line, but not in direction. Are
those instruments covered by this claim? How can they be?
How can you read that patent, in view of its expressed terms,
so as to nake it cover a current which has not the three characteristics that are stated in the patent to be all equally essential? Suppose we take the current of the variable resistance
and compare it for a moment with what Mr. Bell states of the
current here. You lve a current which moves straight along
in one direction; a little more current is thrown on a line at
one movement and a little less at another, but it is moving
straight in one direction. Is there anywhere in this patent a
statement that such a current as that can represent graphically
by the same curve the motions of the air in the air movements
of sound? Nowhere. The only statement in this patent that
electric undulations are capable of being represented graphically by the same curve as the movements of the air particle,
is made of the magneto current, confined to that; not only
confined to that, but the reason is given why, and that reason
applies only to that. That reason not only does not apply to
the variable resistance current, but it excludes it. They can
be represented graphically, because they .have three characteristics, and the variable resistance current has not the three
characteristics. Moreover, not only is the current different,
but the modus o)el'atdi of the mechanismn. The mechanism
itself is structurally different, but its modq'is operandi is also
differeut.
In Mr. Storrow's argument, it is stated very clearly that with
a magneto-electric apparatus, your current and your variations
of current all depend on the motion of the apparatus; on the
motion of the diaphragm, not on its position. Well, is that
true of the variable resistance current? No; it is exactly
untrue; precisely the reverse is true of the variable resistance
current. There, the variations in the current, the amount of
current flowing, depend upon the position of the diaphragm
and not on its motion. I want to nmke that clear, because

OCTOBER TERMI, 1887.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

that is a directly opposite mode of operation of the apparatus.
You have an armature vibrating in front of the pole of an
electro-magnet and it is the motion of the armature which
creates the current.
In the Blake transmitter, the present telephone in use, we
-vary the resistance by pressing on the carbon. The diaphragm
is arranged to press against the carbon, and as it presses it the
current then can pass through the carbon freely. When the
compression is removed and the carbon restored to its natural
condition it will partially obstruct the current, so that the
current has difficulty in getting through. Then as the dinphragm vibrates and varies the pressure it varies the amount
of current passing through, because at times the current is
resisted, and at other times the pressure of the diaphragm
upon the carbon button takes away the resistance. Bell has
got to have a metal diaphragm there and operate by induction,
by the motion, and make the current. This diaphragm may
be made of paper. I could use even this blotting paper for a
diaphragm in this form of telephone. The material is of no
consequence whatever. The mere pressure on that carbon
button is the thing that does the whole work of varying the
resistance of something that is already moving through that
circuit. In the Bell telephone it is this movement that creates
that something through the circuit. In the carbon telephone,
the Blake transmitter that is in common use, that something
is not created by the motion of the diaphragm; it is created
by a battery down under that table. The diaphragm simply
opens or shuts, more or less, the gate through which that something flows at this point. That is the difference. With the
Bell telephone the position of the diaphragm is nothing;, it is
the motion of the diaphragm that does everything. When the
motion is taking place the current variation is taking place;
the current is being excited, just according to the motion.
When the motion of the diaphragm stops the current stops;
there is no current; that ends the current; it is done; it disappears. Now, how is it with the carbontransmitter - the
variable resistance transmitter, I mean by the carbon trans.nitter. It is one form of variable resistance transmitter. How

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

is it with this? The motion of the diaphragm has nothing to
do with it. It is the position of the diaphragm only that does
the work; that controls the amount of current, not the motion
of the diaphragm. Now you see that diametrically-opposite
is the principle of operation, mode of operation, in those
machines. In the one the motion is everything. It is the
moment of motion; it is the act of motion that does the work.
In the other it is not the act of motion; it is the position of
the diaphragm. Get that diaphragm into that position by
any means whatever, whether by sound waves or by a screw
or a lever or your hand, and hold it there, and the effect will
go on as long as that battery lasts.
There is nothing in the motion of the diaphragm that is
peculiar to Mr. Bell, or any invention of his. -What Bell did
was to find a particular way of getting his diaphragm to do
that work and do it on a particular plan, describing it and
limiting himself to it. His theory, as he describes it, consists
in making it produce certain movements of the current which
can be represented graphically by certain curved lines, and
those graphic lines, graphical curves, will correspond exactly
to the lines of the air vibration. That is true of his current,
because he has, in the motion of his current, every motion of
the air wave. But when you take the variable resistance current and undertake to represent it graphically by lines, you
find that those parts of the curve which, with the Bell instrument, were beyond the zero line, are with the other instrument
up above the zero line or down below the zero line at the farthest limit. In other words, you have not the same curve.
Yet he has told you in this patent that you have got to judge
of similarity or non-similarity of the electrical movement -to
his claim here by the graphic curves which represent it; if the
curves are not the same the things are not the same.
I now come to another branch of the case. The following
passage in the patent of 1876 does not appear to be ir harmony with any of its surroundings. "Electrical undulations
may also be caused by alternately increasing and diminishing
the i'esistance of the circuit, or by alternately increasing and
diminishing the power of the battery. The internal resistance

of a battery is diminished by bringing the voltaic elements
nearer together, and increased by placing them farther apart.
The reciprocal vibration of the elements of a battery, therefore, occasions an undulatory action in the voltaic current.
The external resistance may also be varied. For instance, let
mercury or some other liquid form part of a voltaic circuit,
then the more deeply the conducting-wire is immersed in the
mercury or other liquid, the less resistance does the liquid offer
to the passage of the current. Hence, the vibration of the
conducting-wire in mercury or other liquid included in the circuit occasions undulations in the current. The vertical vibrations of the elements of a battery in the liquid in which they
are imuersed produces an undulatory action in the current by
alternately increasing and dimninishing the power of the battery."
All that matter stands by itself in the patent. The fourth
claim of the patent, which is based upon it, stands by itself,
disconnected, as it were, from the other things; not the same
theory running through it; not the same form of current. If
it is not in harmony with its surroundings in the patent, let us
look in the record to find, if possible, an explanation.
While 'Mr. Dell was preparing his specification for the
American Patent Office, being very desirous of taking a patent
in Europe, and especially in his own country. England, where
he conceived the invention to bo equally as valuable under a
patent as here, he sought, in t.e atitunmn of 1875. to interest

about the 24th day of December, and arrived in Toronto
about the 28th. On that evening he had an interview with
Mr. Brown. On the 29th the negotiations were concluded,
Brown agreeing to take an interest, and to go abroad and take
out patents there, furnishing the money to pay all expenses.
Bell returned and put the finishing touches to the specification
between the 1st and 10th of January, 186. On the 10th
Hubbard took the rough- draft to Bell's solicitor in Washington. On the 16th or 18th he wrote Bell that no changes
were necessary, and on the 18th the solicitor sent Bell a fair
copy engrossed for signature. Bell swore to it on the 20th,
and returned it at once to be filed in the Patent Office.
Brown arrived in New York about the 25th of January. Bell
came there to meet him. Hubbard and Pollol, the solicitor,
also came on to New York from Washington, the latter bringing with him the copy of the specification which had been prepared for filing in the Patent Office, and a fair copy of the
same to be given to Mr. Brown. So that it appears from the
evidence that on or about the 25th of January, Mr. Bell, Mr.
Brown, Air. Pollok and Mr. Hubbard were together in New
York with the specification prepared for Mr. Brown'to take
to Europe, and the specification that Mr. Pollok had in his
hands at Washington preparatory to filing it in the Patent
Office.
[The copy which Mr. Brown had is set forth supra,pp. 88-96.]
All the evidence to which I shall refer in this connection is
the complainants' evidence drawn out on cross examinations,
and documents drawn from them or their counsel, put in at
different times in the progress of the- case, without either party
seeing the connection of those documents with each other. I
drew them out and put them in because I saw that some of
them had some reference to these proceedings, and that they
might prove to be important. But I did not appreciate the
meaning of their contents when I put them in evidence, and I
presume the same is true of the other side.
[Here a discussion ensued upon the propriety of this lin6 of
argument, and Mr. Hill being questioned as to the point he
was seeking to establish said:]

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
31r. Mirs Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

Mr. Bell has testified over and over again that there was no
change made in the specification which he filed in the Patent
Office, from the time the document went into Mr. Pollok's
hands on the 10th of January, 1876, until the time of its filing
February 14th. It was sworn to on the 20th of January, 1876,
and after that date, as was held in the Tanner car-brake case,
after the date of its filing in the Patent Office, it could not be
changed lawfully without a new filing, a new case, a new oath,
and a new application. After the 20th January it could not
be changed so as to introduce a new invention without a new
oath. The evidence, as we contend, is that a change was made
after that time. I shall endeavor to show that it must have
been done after the 20th of January, after the oath of the
American specification was taken. Mr. Bell has further stated
that the specification: which he swore to on the 20th of January, was the same specification without any change of phraseology, that he had sent to IPollok on the 10th of January, and
of which -Mr.Poliok had made a fair copy and returned it to
him on the 18th to be sworn to. I will give you the history
as briefly as I can.
I am not impeaching this patent for fraud, by way of setting
up fraud as a defence in the answer. If we had set up in our
answer in this case that the patent was obtained by fraud, that
answer would be demurrable. There is no doubt about that.
If we had attempted to introduce evidence on the part of the
defendants to prove that fraud, that evidence would have been
objectionable and would have been stricken out. The government alone can bring such a suit. But that is not the point.
We stand upon another point, and if it is not correctly taken I
have nothing further to say. It is for your Honors to aicide.
We have not raised that question in the answer. The complaina-nts have come into a court of equity, producing a title
deed, producing their evidence showing how that deed was
obtained, how that deed was made, what it stated, wLat it was
for, what it intended to convey; and in their evidence in support of their own title they have proved, as we submit, the
fraudulent character of *thattitle deed. If they come in here
with that title deed and show by their own evidence that the

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

deed is fraudulent, then I apprehend that in a court of equity
they have not the standing which would entitle them to protection.
[One of the Justices having expressed a desire to hear the
counsel on the line of argument he had marked out for himself, he was directed to proceed, and he continued :
It appears, upon examination of the George Brown specification, that it had been carefully compared with the American
application, and in many matters changed, in order to make it
correspond. [Mr. Hill here reviewed the changes, which
appear in the copy printed sipra, pages SS to 96.] Now
when we come to compare the document which Mr. Bell sent
to Europe cotemporaneously with his sending the document
to Washington to obtain a patent upon this invention, we find
that in this document which departed from New York in the
last week in January, and which, therefore, was not accessible
to Mr. Bell to change after that date, which was not accessible
for interpolation after that date, there is not one word about
a variable resistance current,-a liquid transmitter, or any. other
method whatever except the induction telephone, the magneto
telephone, with its back and forth current. But in the document which remained in this country, which went to the
Patent Office and became accessible to -Mr.Bell's attorneys at
Washington, and remained accessible to them, there appears
another and second invention of equal importance with the
magneto telephone invention, to wit, the invention of a variable resistance telephone. The question is, how did that get
in there; when did that get in there; where did it come from?
As I remarked once before, if we look at the history of 1Mr.
Bell's operations, we fail to find it. Up to that point not a
word, not a thought can be discovered in Mr. Bell's history,
with the severest lights that can be thrown upon it, of the
idea of any of these mechanisms that are specified in that
patent - a wire dipping in liquid, the vibrations of a wire,
the vibrations of the elements of the battery to and fro, up
and down in the current, or anything of that kind. They
suddenly appear full blown in the American specification.
But there is more than that. That is not all. In the paper

OCTOBER TERMK, 1887.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

sent to Europe there was an express and positive declaration
to the effect that the variable resistance current could not
be employed for this purpose-not in those words, but in
equivalent words.
And further, there is an important statement in the Brown
specification which is not in the American application. The
original statement in the George Brown paper was this:
"Undulatory currents of electricity may be produced in many
other ways than .that described above, but all the methods
depend for effect upon the vibration or motion of bodies
capable of inductive action." At some time that expression
was stricken out from the Brown copy, and the following
substituted for it: "There are many other ways of producing
undulatory currents of electricity, but all of them depend for
effect upon the vibration, or motion of bodies capable of
inductive action."
This is the same statement in different terms. In the
American specification theword "dependent" is substituted
for "but all of them depend for." That substitution means
this. With this statement in the George Brown copy it
would be an impossibility to proceed to set forth immediately
afterwards that this effect could be produced by a current
that was not induced by the vibration or motion of the body.
The statement is here that all the ways depended, every way
known to Mr. Bell when he wrote that statement, depended
for effect upon the vibration or motion of bodies capable of
inductive action. He knew of no other way. Now he toned
that down to this statement: That there are many ways
dependent upon the vibration or motion of bodies capable of
inductive action; but there are, he proceeds to describe, many
other ways not dependent upon it. It is not inconsistent with
the immediate description following in the next line, if you
please, of other ways .not dependent. There are many ways
dependent; there may be many ways not dependent. But in
the George Brown specification the statement was emphatically and positively that there were many bther ways, but
all of them dependent. There was no room, then, for the
description of any other way of doing it. That is one of the

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. 11ll's Argument'for People's and Overland Cos.

significant changes between the George Brown specification,
which was sent to Europe after the American sl:ecification
was sworn to; a change from an expression which excluded
by its terms a variable resistance current, and made it
improbable that it could have been thought of, to the flexible
statement in the American application.
If this variable resistance description was not in the American specification on the 25th of January, when that copy was
sent to Europe by Brown, then, according to his own testimony, it was not in the American specification when it was
filed. If it was in the American specification on the 25th of
January, when he was about to send to Europe and obtain a
patent there, it is absolutely inconceivable that a copy could
have been handed to Brown, and that Brown could have been
allowed to depart for Europe and patent one-half of the invention there without the other half, and with that explicit
statement that the other half was not patentable.
Now how could Bell learn of this e Where did this knowledge come from Is there any source from which he could
have derived this information prior to the issue of the patent,
and been able to interpolate those words.e
On the 14th of February, 187, 11r. Elisha Gray filed a
caveat in tile Patent Office. See sujqra, pages 77-S8. That
caveat described the variable resistance current. The transmitting apparatus is what is called a liquid transmitter. Your
Honors will find in the drawing in the lower right-hand corner a picture of the transinitter. It consists of a cone or box
to speak into, closed at the lower end b1 ' a flexible diaphragmi,
which would take up the vibrations of the air. and a wire cxtending down fronm that diaphragin into a cup of li( 1ui(I below.
That wire and diaphragnl of the transmitter were in the circuit, so that the current cane in throug.l the side of the transmitting box and ran down that wire into the liquid. The
current comes in through the wire to the side of the transmittinG cone. You will notice a screw binding-post, as electricians
call it (a little screw that runs into a post, called a bindingpost, because it binds the circuit wire to the instrunient), at
the left-hand side of the transmitting instrument.

The wire

Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

comes in and is attached to the binding-post making the electrical connection. I think you will see dotted lines running
down to show how the circuit of wire is made. The connection is with a little wire at the centre of the diaphragm that
extends down into the liquid, so that the current coming into
the line would enter the binding-post, run across to the central wire, and down the central wire to the liquid. Then at
the bottom of the cup you will notice another binding-post,
through which the line goes off. The current coming to the
transmitter passes through the, binding-post, down the centre
line into the liquid, passes through, the liquid, goes to the
lower binding-post and there passes off the line, and goes to
the receiver at the left hand of the drawing, the upper figure.
A wire goes to the receiver, and runs down to the ground to a
ground plate. The circuit is completed through the ground,
and goes back to the ground plate at the right end of the
drawing. Then it runs up on its way to the transmitting instrument; it passes through the apparatus that is represented
by little parallel plates, some of them longer and some of them
shorter. They indicate the battery. That-is the conventional
method adopted by electricians to indicate a battery. The
variable resistance is produced by the fluid, and takes place in
this way, and I ask your Honors' particular attention here.
The liquid which Mr. Gray describes I ask your attention to,
because it has some bearing on the question. That liquid was
water. Water is a conductor of electricity. Electricity will
pass through it. It will not interrupt a current of electricity.
The current will pass through it, but it, gives a certain resistance to the circuit. The current does not pass through it
readily as it does in the'case of a copper or"iron wire. Electricity will travel very easily over an iron'6-r copper wire. '-It
seems to pass through it as water would pass through an open
tube. Hence, the current coining th'ough this line over the
copper or iron wire, and coining to the transmitting instrument and passing down through the-wire at the bottom of the
diaphrhagm into the liquid, passes freely and easily until -it gets
to the liquid, and then it has to pass through the liquid. 'But
the liquid is something that it cannot get through, so easily.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

The liquid obstructs it. It has had an open field, but now it
has got into the underbrush, so to speak. It has to force its
way through the brambles, and it has to exert more force as
it meets with more opposition. The theory of this liquid
transmitter is this: That by attaching that little wire which
dips down into the liquid to a diaphragm, then the sound
spoken to the diaphragm will vibrate the diaphragm, causing
the wire to rise and fall in the liquid.. As the wire drops
down it brings the good conductor nearer to the lower wire,
and makes a shorter path of liquid for it to travel through.
As the diaphragm rises up it pulls the wire up and makes a
longer path of liquid for the current to travel through. Hence
the current travels more easily through that liquid when the
wire is depressed and when the diaphragm is vibrating down,
because it has less distance to travel through the bad conductor; and it travels with more difficulty through the liquid
when the wire is up, because it has a greater distance to travel
through the bad conductor, But it travels all the time just
the same. It is only a question how much of it will go
through when the wire is up; some of the current will go
through and go off the line all the time, and when the wire is
down more of the current will go through. It does not
change the direction of the current. The. current is going in
one way all the time. It simply changes the quantity that
goes in that one way. The vibration of the diaphragm makes
the wire go up and down in the liquid, but it does not vary the
direction of the current at all. It simply varies the quantity.
Allow me here to call attention to the fact that there are
three ways by which a vibrating diaphragm influences the
character of the current on the line. The first way is that of
Bourseul, published in 1854, by which the vibrating diaphragm
comes in contact with the erid of the circuit wire and breaks
comes in contact the current coming
the contact. When it.
through the diaphragm goes to the wire and passes along it.
When it breaks the contact the current cannot get across and
it remains on this side. That mode of vibrating the diaphragm
into and out of contact with the end of the circuit wire
makes a broken, a make and break current, an intermittent

238

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. l1ill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

current, if you pleas6; but it is the vibrating diaphragm which
does it in that case. That is one of the currents made by
vibrating the diaphragm. In Mr. Bell's patent the vibrating
diaphragm is provided with an armature of inductive material.
That was Ar. Bell's thought. That armature of inductive
material must be placed in front of an electro-magnet or its
equivalent, which is a necessity with that form of instrument.
Now, when you vibrate the electro-magnet, the motion of the
armature, the inductive material forces a current one way and
draws it back the other as it vibrates. That is the second way
by which a vibrating diaphragm can control the current on
the line. There is a third way, and that is the way of Gray's
caveat. There is no inductive material about the diaphragm.
There is no electro-magnet present. It is not needed. You
do not depend upon induction. You depart from the principle altogether, just as Bourseul had suggested in 1854. You
simply extend the circuit wire from the diaphragmldown into
that bad conductor, the liquid, and vibrate it up and down in
that poor conductor, changing the quantity of current, but not
changing the current, nor reversing or alternating it. That
was the third wa,. Those are the three ways of controlling
the current by the vibrations of the diaphragm, and e4ch
differs in principle from the others.
The Bourseul way involves one principle; the Bell way another; the Gray way a third. There are three independent ways
of doing it, involving different mechanism, different modes of
operation, and producing different current effects on the line.
In the Bourseul case it is a broken current; in the Bell ca ge
a back and forth current; and in the Gray case a currel t
o'oinzo in one direction all the time, simply.changingineutitv from time to time.
iNow how could Gra,'s caveat, which was a secret documer
in the Patent Otiee, become known to Bell before the interference on the 19th of February? The variable resistance
passage was in his application on the 19th of February. If
it was not there on the 14th, and was there on the 19th, how
could lie have known about the Gray caveat between those
dates ?

TELEPHONE CASES.
ir.

Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

The complainants' evidence on another subject furnishes
some light on this one.- On the 19th of January, 1875, Gray
filed two applications for multiple telegraphy, and on the 23d
of February, 1875, he filed a third application. On the 5th of
March, 1875, Bell wrote a letter to his parents in which he
said: "In regard to the patents, my lawyers found on examination at the Patent Office that I had developed the idea so
much further than Gray had done that they have applied for
three distinct patents, in only one of which I come into collision with Gray. The first patent covers the principle of' multiple telegraphy, basing my claim upon the instruments exhibited. The second patent covers the- principle of using an
induced current so as to permit a single wire to be employed.
The third patent is for a vibratory circuit-breaker for the
purpose of converting the vibratory motion of my receiving 2instrument into a permanent make or break of a local circuit. '
He describes how this can be arranged so as to make an
"autograph" telegraph. Then he says:
"My lawyers were at first doubtful whether the examiners
would declare an interference between me and Gray, as Gray's
apparatus had been there for so long a time. They feared I
had but a poor chance, and my spirits at once fell to zero.
They said it would be difficult to convince them that I had
not copied. When, however, they saw the 'autograph' telegraph developed from the idea of that of multiple telegraphy,
they at once said that was a good proof of independent invention, as Gray had no such idea. It further turned out that an
examiner in the Patent Office (not, however, of electrical
inventions) is a deaf mute, and knows me personally and by
reputation, and could surely vouch for -the. fact of my being
incapable of copying Gray."
Now on the day that that letter was written, Gray had no
patent on multiple telegraphy. The things which were examined in the Patent Office were his applications, which were
required by law to be kept secret. Thus it is clear that at that
time Bell's solicitors had access to the secret archives of the
Patent Office, learned exactly what Gray had done, and were
able to compare what Gray had done, as shown by those

OCTOBER TERM,

papers, with what Bell claimed to have done.
ot only did
they find that they, could compare Bell's papers with Gray's
in the Patent Office, and find out just how much further Bell
had gone than Gray claimed to have gone, but they directed
Bell at once to file three applications in consequence of that
information. They found, he says, that he had developed the
idea so much further than Gray had done that they had applied for three distinct patents, using the information to direct
and control Mr. Bell's operations in multiple telegraphy matters. That was the use they made of it. Now, it appears
from Mr. Bell's statement in evidence that he did file three'
applications. The first of those three applications was filed
on the 25th of February, 1875, two days after Gray's application was filed. How instantaneous was the knowledge which
they obtained of Gray's papers! Gray's last application, the
most important one, filed the 23d of February, and 2fr. Bell,
in the Patent Office for the purpose of interfering with that
application on the 25th of February; and with the admission
here that in the interval the attorneys had obtained the
knowledge from Gray's papers and had caused him to file
these applications to meet them. He describes various inventions, and then down at the bottom of the page he makes a
further statement to show that he knew from those papers
what Gray had done.
"When, however, they saw the autograph telegraph developed from the idea of that of multiple telegraphy, they at once
said that was a good proof of independent invention, as Gray
had no such idea."
How did they know? They could not tell; they could not
know it without an examination of Gray's papers. But they
did not have even to go to the Patent Office to get inforination, for in the same letter Bell says:
"Another fortunate circumstance was this. That the very
examiner into whose hands this will come happened to be in
Mr. Pollok's office one day when I called, so that I had a long
interview with him, in which I explained everything to him,
and I can't help thinking that he must have been convinced of
my independent conception of the whole thin&."

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

After the issue of his patents Bell endeavored to mislead
Gray about the proceedings at the Patent Office. In a subsequent correspondence between them. Gray wrote Bell about
his caveat. Bell replied: "I to not know the nature of the
application for a caveat to which you have referred as having
been filed two hours after m.y application for a patent, excepting that it had something to do with the vibration of a wire in
water, and therefore conflicted with my patent. Mly specification had been prepared months before it was filed, and a copy
had been taken to England by a friend." There is an admission that the copy given to Brown was a copy of the application
on file in the Patent Office.
The subject matter in controversy between Bell and Gray
was this variable resistance, and the only subject matter in
controversy. Mr. Bell writes to -r. Gray trying to convince
him that that subject matter belonged to him, Bell, and he
makes this statement: "I did not know anything about your
caveat, except that it had something to do with the vibration
of a wire dipping in water. My specification had been pre.pared months before it was filed" - months before the 14th
of February, 18716 -" and a copy had been taken to Europe by
a friend." What is the intimation to Mr. Gray? The intimation is, "It is of no use for you to contend about this variable
resistance. It is in my patent. I can prove that I had it
months and months before my application was filed, because
I can prove that my application was made, written, months
before it was filed, and I can prove it by the copy taken to
Europe." But he could not prove it by the copy taken to
Europe. That copy did not contain the subject matter in controversy between Mr. Gray and Afr. Bell. The copy had not
a word in it about variable resistance. What was the assertion
that Mr. tell was making to Mr. Gray as a matter of fact?
Was it true or was it false ? If this statement was true, then
it is true, that the paper taken to Europe by George Brown
was a copy of the paper filed, and the specification as filed did
not contain the variable resistance. If that be not a fact, then
the letter is to all intents and purposes, as well as in terms, a
falsehood, stated to Mr. Gray to mislead him. There is no

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.

escape from that alternative. When Mr. Bell said that he had
prepared it months before it was filed, and a copy had been
taken to England by a friend in order to mislead Mr. Gray
and induce Mr. Gray to abandon his claims to it; then it is
either true that the copy which was taken to England by a
friend was a copy or it was not a copy. If it was a copy of
the specification (we know what it was) the specification as
filed did not contain the variable resistance. If it was not a
copy this statement to Gray was false, for the purpose of
deceiving him, and inducing him to abandon his claims.
But it may be said, if this was interpolated in the application
of Bell, how could it have been interpolated? Why, the application on file was composed of a number of sheets fastened
together by paper fasteners in the usual way. All you have
to do, is to straighten up those paper fasteners, pick out the
sheets, remove them, and substitute other sheets, or any material you want to put in. If you have access to the Patent Office,
as these parties had with the Examiner there, it is a matter of
a few minutes' work to go in there any evening after the clerks
have gone, take any papers out and substitute any other papers
in their place. Could they do it? Were they in a situation to
do it? Wihy, this original copy is proved by Mr. Bell to have
been made by his sclicitors (the copy that was filed -in the
Patent Office), prepared at their office, written by one of their
clerks; and thirty days afterwards it was just as easy for them
to have taken that application and have other sheets written
by the same cleik and substituted in it, as it was to put the
original in. So that the road was open, the means were all
there; the parties, as we know by the transactions of the year
before in reference to Gray's pending application, were the
very parties to carry out such projects.
[Mr. Hill closed by reviewing evidence in the record which
he contended showed the subsequent conduct of Mr. Bell to be
consistent with this theory:]
MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY: Your point I understand to be this:
That the true construction of Bell's patent, so far as you deem
it valid, and not claiming a mere principle, is a patent for a

was in fact invented by Elisha Gray. The charge is competent under that issue, and must be passed upon.
They characterize the charge by the severest language, and
they accompany it with protestations of the sense of responsibility under which it is made. They do not overstate the
gravity of the crime if it has been committed, nor the awful
responsibility which rests on them if the charge shall turn out
to be false, and without justifiable foundation. But the brief
filed in this court contains the first intimation ever made in
this long litigation that such a charge was thought of. Under
these circumstances, strained inferences, or the absence of
specific disproof in the record, cannot establish so foul a crime;
and our opponents pretend to nothing else to rest it upon.
But fortunately there is that in the record which conclusively
disproves it.
This charge, contained in the briefs signed by Xlb. Hill and
his partner, Mr. Dixon, is, that the application sworn to by
Mr. Bell, January 20, 1876, and filed in the Patent, Office
February 14, 1876, contained no reference to the liquid transmitter, but was limited to a magneto telephone, operating,
they say, by what they call a to-and-fro or wiggle-waggle
current. They charge that within four days after the application was filed, Mr. Bell's solicitors obtained dishonest knowledge of the contents of Gray's caveat, which described a liquid
transmitter; that thereupon, they, in Mr. Bell's absence, and
without his knowledge, stole Bell's application from the Patent Office, dishonestly rewrote it or part of it, inserting a description of a liquid transmitter learned from Gray's caveat,
adding a claim based thereon, and dishonestly replaced in
the files the application with these interpolated sheets.
To understand the relation of the liquid transmitter part to
the rest of the patent it should be stated that Mr. Bell first invented the "method" specifically described in his. patent and
in his fifth claim, and de.vised the "magneto" form of speaking telephone to embody it. They confess that his original
application, by Fig. 7 and the letter press connected with it,
described this magneto telephone and the novel method or principle by which it transmits speech, and contained his present

TELEPHONE CASES.
Air. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

fifth claim which is in terms for that "method." No attack
is made on his originality as regards this, and the fifth claim is
the only claim sued on. The liquid transmitter part of this
patent is the sole subject of this charge. That part describes
an alternative, or, if you please, an improved type of apparatus embodying the same "method" and principle, and claim
4 is a special claim for this particular modification. But the
liquid transmitter as a form, is too inconvenient for practical use.
As matter of law it is not needed to sustain the broad claim 5.
The only use we make of its description in the patent is to
base upon it the merely cumulative argument that the existence of an actual intention not to limit claim 5 to the magneto
form is not an open question, because the patent itself points
out that there are alternative forms.
I return now to the charge that the liquid transmitter part
was copied from Gray's caveat -for that is the extent of the
charge.
Gray's description calls for the use of water or some liquid
of "high" electrical resistance. The description in the Bell
patent specifies "mercury or some other liquid;" m6rcury is
a liquid of "low" electrical resistance. They say that the suggestion of mercury, or any "low" rtesistance liquid, involves an
electrical impossibility or absurdity proving that a good electrician like Mr. Bell never could have written that description,
and that it must have been written in by some ignorant person - they say by his solicitors - presumably ignorant of electrical science, and without his knowledge. How or why a
copyist could have made such a change they do not, however,
and cannot, suggest. They say that this interpolation could
not have been made except between February 14 and 19,1876,
because two independent official records in the Patent Office
show that these clauses were in the application on February 19;
and that is true. They agree that this proves that Mr. Bell
could not have committed the alleged crime, for he was not in
Washington during the whole of that month until February
26th. They aver that when he came to Washington, on February 26, he was informed of the forgery his solicitors had
committed in his behalf, and joyfully ratified it; that he then

went to the examiner's room to look- over the application; by
permission of the examiner sat down to make in pencil various
purely verbal amendments of no importance; and that while
making these he perceived that his solicitors had made their
interpolations so clumsily that they had left in a part of the
old specification which was specifically inconsistent with the
liquid transmitter clauses ; that he thereupon drew his pencil
through the olbjectionable words, and, in pencil, interlined others
consistent with the liquid transmitter, and wrote many other
pencil emendations, thirty-eight in all, making the paper read
as it now does in the patent; and.that the specification issued
in the patent is this twice-forged and corrupted paper. That is
their story, and each one of these steps is a necessary part of
it, cohstructed to account for some existing fact which they
find they cannot dispute.
They are met at once with the fact that the original application now in the fies of the Office, a photograph of which,
taken in October, 1885, is in the case, is exactly, letter for
letter, like the specification in the patent which was printed
and left the Office March 7, 1876; and that that original
paper now on file has every word fair-written in ink, without
any sign or indication of any pencil interlineation, whatever,
and without any place where any interlineation or change could
have been made. To this they reply that the present clean
paper is itself a forgery, -for if it is not, it absolutely destroys
their charge of interlineations. They say that the Bell company in April, "879, procured a certified copy which showed
all these mutilations, and that soon afterwards *r. Bell, or
some one in his interest cognizant of what they aver had been
done, perceiving that its condition would disclose the alleged
fraud, stole the supposed interlined and altered specification
as it then existed in the files, rewrote it, making a fair, clean
paper in ink, and placed this in the files as if it were the
original;, and they say that it is because of this third forgery
that the paper in the files reads to-day in fair writing like the
1876.
specification issued by the Office in March,
They are again met by certain facts. One is that the
employment of some kind of a variable resistance (a liquid

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's. Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

transmitter is one well-known instance of variable resistance)
was in Mr. Bell's mind as a device to be employed in the
transmitter as early as May 4, 1375, nine months before the
Gray caveat existed, and was disclosed by him in a letter of
that date which is in the record. They are also met by the
fact that the character and structure of Mr. Bell's liquid transmitter is as different from that of the Gray caveat as one
liquid transmitter can be from another; and by the further
fact that, instead of the use of mercury being an electrical
absurdity, it is a fact proved in the case that Mr. Bell actually
made a mercury transmitter, and that it talked, while there is
no evidence whatever even tending to show that the water
transmitter of Gray ever did or ever could talk, the only proof
touching the subject being that the one he tried to make in
the summer of 1576 would not talk at all. Thus the idea of
employing a variable resistance transmitter was expressed by
Mir. Bell in writilig nine months before Gray thought of the
subject, and the form in which M1r. Bell embodied it was so
strikingly different from that of Gray as of itself to prove
originality and disprove copying. So Bell already had the
idea, and did not copy the form. They are met by the further
fact, stated in their brief, that the file of the Bell patent was,
in 1879, well known and had been examined by many people.
Indeed it is an essential part of their hypothesis that it was
read and handled so much that many pencil marks which they
aver were there in 1870, and were not there when a certain
certified copy was made in April, 1879, bad been entirely
obliterated by handling. According to their story, there were
thirty-eight different passages altered in pencil. It is impossible that such a peculiar and well-known paper in such an
important case could have been at that time replaced by a
clean Copy, all written in ink, without at once attracting the
attention. of the official in charge of the file, and all of those
who had occasion to examine it; and it is certain that any
man must have known that such a substitution could not be
concealed, but would at once draw attention, and therfore
that no man would have attempted it.
These considerations, the infamous character of the act

OCTOBER TERMI,

Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

alleged, and the fact that no evidence supports it, dispose of
the charge thus tardily made.
They say, however, that one piece of evidence does support
it. They refer to a dertain certified copy of the application
procured by the Bell Company from the Patent Office April
10, 1879, soon afterwards filed in tle Circuit Court at Boston
and printed in the summer of that year in the Dowd case, the
printed record of which was, by stipulation and for convenience, introduced into or reprinted in the other cases before
this court. They aver that that certified copy (here called the
:Boston exhibit) had thirty-eight erasures or interlineations,
indicated, as there printed, by parenthesis marks or by redundant words on the printed page; and they allege that that
paper shows that when that certified copy was made, on April
10, 1879, the original was in that interlined and altered condition (because the habit of the Patent Office in making a copy
of a specification is to make it, as near as may be, in facsimile) and that the clean paper now in the files must therefore be a forgery. That is the ground, and the only specific
proof on which they assert this forgery. One answer to that is
that this copy of 1879 was originally put in evidence by Mr.
Bell himself, as part of his own deposition, and it is impossible
to believe that he would have voluntarily put into the case conclusive evidence of these interlineations just at a time when,
according to our opponents' story, he and his associates were so
terrified at the prospect of the alleged interlineations being
known that they were perpetrating a third forgery to conceal
them. They do not produce the original certified copy of
April 10, 1879, but rely on what they assume to be a correctly
printed copy of it in the printed transcript.
Our opponents point to another circumstance. It appears
that in the fall of 1875 Mr. Bell prepared several copies of an
early draft of the specification in the condition in which it then
was. One of these copies so written by Mr. Bell was aftefwards much altered and amended by him; the changes were
completed about the middle of January, 1876, when this particAlr paper went to Washington; and a fair copy of it as
amended, made in his solicitors' office at Washington, became

F

Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

the application sworn to in Boston, January 20, and filed February 14, 1876. Another copy of the early draft went to Mr.
George Brown of Toronto, who, on January 25, 1876, took it
to England with several other specifications of Mr. Bell, intending to take English patents on all of them. Mr. Brown
did not take out any English patents whatever, but brought
back the papers with him, and in the fall of 1878 Mr. Bell
obtained them from him and himself offered them in evidence.
The specification as it now appears in the fies, and the patent
as issued in 1876 (both exactly alike), differ from the George
Brown specification, in that they contain the liquid transmitter
clauses and also vary in thirty-seven or thirty-eight other passages from the George Brown specification. Attention was
not called in taking testimony, nor at the trial below, to these
differences, but r. Bell, in giving a history of his work, stated
that he repeatedly corrected and altered and improved his
American specification up to the last moment, and did not complete his amendments until just as he sent it to Washington in
the middle of January, 1876. Nor is there any specific testimony as to when he last touched pen to the George Brown
specification. The proof is that he prepared it in Odtober and
November, 1875, and that on December 29, in pursuance of a
previous verbal understanding of September, 1875, he made a
contract with George Brown which required him to at once
furnish the specifications. He testified that he began to prepare the specification for Brown early in October, 1875, and
that he furnished it to Mr. Brown between the date of that
contract and January 25, 1876, when Mr. Brown sailed for
England. He did not remember during which part of that
period the specifications were furnished, but the just inference
is that it was a day or two after the contract, because they had
been prepared some months previously in order to be furnished,
and he agreed to furnish them at once, as Mr. Brown was
expecting to immediately sail for England, and he returned
from Toronto to Boston instantly upon the execution of the
contract. There was nothing in the case which seemed to
make the precise date material. The fair conclusion from the
testimony is that immediately after signing the Brown contract

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

of December 29, 1875, he furnished the specifications which he
had had on hand two months for that purpose just in the condition in which they had been, -a rough paper with many corrections and interlineations, which is the condition of the
paper, now an exhibit in the case; that he continued to improve and amend the American specification, and, after he had
parted ;ith the Brown one, during the ensuing two weeks
before :the American specification went to Washington, wrote
the liquid transmitter clause into it. This is corroborated by
the fact that a sworn paper filed by him in the Patent Office
in 1878, states under oath that the precise form known as the
liquid transmitter was devised by him in the first half of January, 1876, though the idea of employing some form of variable
resistance as distinguished from the magneto transmitter bad
been expressed by him in a letter of May 4, 1875. The date
thus stated for the liquid invention is between the time when
we believe he furnished the drafts to Mr. Brown, and the day
when he sent his last corrected specification to the solicitor at
Washington. It is impossible therefore to draw from the
George Brown papers any inference unfavorable to Mr. Bell.
To support their charges, our opponents have really but one
piece of evidence, and that they rely on and have argued at
great length in their brief. The printed copy of the Bell file
found in the printed Dowd record, and reprinted in some of
the other cases, contains thirty-eight instances of what appear
to be inferlineations or cancellations.
Thus one paragraph as there printed reads: "The duration
of-:the sound may be used (made) to indicate (signify) the dot
or dash of the Morse alphabet, and thus a telegraphic despatch
may be indicated (can be transmitted) by alternately interrupting and renewing the sound."
.They argue that this paragraph was written in the application as filed with one set of the synonymous words, e.g. "signify," regularly written in ink; that afterwards that word was
cancelled by drawing a pencil mark through it, and the other
word, "indicate," interlined in pencil; and that the printer
printed both in the same line. There are thirty-eight passages
which they point out as containing such changes. Among,

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argumept for American Bell Telephone Co.

such supposed interlineations or alterations, generally indicated
(but not always correctly) by parenthesis marks in the printed
copy, are the clauses about the liquid transmitter, which are
included in parenthesis in that Dowd print. Now, it is found
in every one of these cases of a duplication of words, e.g.
"indicate (signify)" etc., that on6 of the two words is tho
word of the patent as issued, and the other word is the word
of the older George Brbwn specification. Our opponents say
that this arose in the following way: That the application filed
by Mr. Bell February 14, 1876, was an ink copy of the George
Brown specification; that after it was filed he dishonestly
altered it by pencil cancellation and interpolation, between
February 27 and -March 3, and that this altered copy became
the patent; that the cancelling marks have been rubbed out
by constant handling of the paper before April, 1879 (and it
is an essential part of their hypothesis that the alleged cancelling marks were thus accidentally obliterated), while by some
curious freak of nature every one of the interlineations remained, so that both sets of words appeared in the certified
copy made April 10, 1879. From this they argue that the
application as filed was a copy-of the George Brown specification, and did not have the liquid transmitter part in it, and
that that was interpolated afterwards in the dishonest. and
criminal manner alleged.
It may be assumed that the printed paper in the Dowd
record which contains the duplication of words, one of which
in each case is that of the George Brown specification, and
the other of which in each case is that of the patent, could
not have come into existence except by the act of some one
who had both sets of words before him or in his mind, and
was interlining one set into a paper which originally had the
other. But whether the person had the George Brown form,
and interlined the words of the patent, or whether he had the
form of the patent and interlined the George Brown words,
the paper would equally have the same two sets. The original paper itself, however, would show which he was doing. If
he had a. paper ink-written in the words of the patent, and
was - interlining the George Brown words, so as to show

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
31r. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

them also, then, in the actual paper, the words of the patent
would be found regularly fair-written in ink, with the George
Brown words interlined; if he were writing with pencil on
a fair copy of the George Brown draft, to make it read like
the patent, then -the George Brown words would be fairwritten in ink and the words of the patent interlined. Now,
the copy, a _printvd, does not show in which of these two
ways the duplication occurred. The original exhibit itself,
filed in Boston, would show the fact, but they do not exhibit
that to the court.
The truth about it is simply this: The certified copy of the
application, procured April 10, 1879, by the Bell company,
was a fair-written copy in ink, and that ink writing reads letter for letter, word for word, line for line, and page for page
(it is the custom in the Patent Office to copy applications in
such fac-simile) like the application now on file, a photograph
of which is furnished to the court. Counsel for the Bell company, in preparing -the Dowd case in 1879, took that certified
copy, which was procured for his office use, and, with the
George Brown specificatibn beside it, proceeded to compare the
two, to learn for himself the progress between -November or
December, 1875, when the one was completed, and January
20, 1876, when the other was sworn to. For greater convenience, he made memoranda of the differences of the two in
pencil on the certified copy itself, by generally making pencil
parenthesis marks around the words in the certified copy
which were not in, or had no corresponding phrases in, the
George Brown draft, and interlining in pencil, on the ink-written certified copy, George Brown words which were not in the
certified copy. Subsequently, that certified copy was put in
evidence in the Dowd case, without remembering to rub out
the pencil marks. It was printed in the Dowd case, - not
under the supervision of counsel, but by some one else, who
printed the pencil marks and all, and the printer added some
other parenthesis marks, according to his own notions. As
the Dowd case was not argued, the attention of counsel was
not called to the accident. Several hundred pages of the
Dowd printed record were, put into the Drawbaugh case and

other later cases for convenience, by stipulation, these among
them, and were there reprinted, and- the accidental error still
escaped notice. In February, 1886, however, counsel for the
Bell company noticed the error, and at once wrote to the
counsel for the Drawbaugh company that that paper was incorrectly printed in the Dowd record, saying, "there were
some pencil marks on the copy that went to the printer in the
Dowd case, with brackets, etc., and that got reproduced in
your case." He asked that a new and correct copy be substituted and printed. This was agreed to in writing, a correct
copy was printed by the defendants, and is a part of the
record, and a further stipulation was made that the court, for
greater accuracy, might refer to the originals.' The original

of this paper is part of the files of the Dowd case, in the
Circuit Court in Boston, where it has been since 189. The
clerk of that court is in this court room, with the paper in
his possession, and I ask that he hand it to the court, and that
the court examine it.
[A discussion ensued, and the court decided that under the
stipulation this could be done, and the clerk .handed the original to the Chief Justice.]
That paper, now in the hands of the court, shows this state
of facts. It is asserted by my opponents as the basis of their
hypothesis, - and it is true:- that the ink-written part of
that Boston exhibit is a fac-simile of all that was in ink in the
original application. Now what was in ink in that original
application? It appears that the ink-written part of that
Boston exhibit is in the exact words of the patent as issued,
and that its ink-written part is exactly the same. as the
paper to-day in the files of the Patent Office. Its ink part
is a fac-simile of that paper, - the same words, the same
words in each line, the same lines on each page. Particularly
the words which are in the patent, in the application on file
at the Patent Office, and in the Boston exhibit, but are not
in the George Brown draft, including the passage about
the liquid transmitter, are fair-written in ink in the Boston
exhibit, and generally (in the original Boston exhibit) have
parenthesis marks around them in pencil. The words of
the George Brown draft, which are not in the patent, are
not in ink in the Boston exhibit, but are interlined in it
with pencil. And the Dowd print is a copy of this paper,
ink, pencil, and all, with a few typographical errors, but with
the words priuted consecutively, so that it does not show what
is interlined and what is fair-written.
This will be better understood from examination of one
passage by way of illustration.
From the Boston exhibit as printed jn the Dowd case:
"The duration of the sound may be used (made) to indicate
(signify) the dot or dash of the Morse alphabet, and thus a
telegraphic despatch may be indicated (can be transmitted) by
alternately interrupting and renewing the sound."

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

Fac-simile from the Boston exhibit.

The words regularly written in the line are all in ink, and
are the words of the patent. The words interlined are in pencil, and are the George Brown words. The parenthesis marks
are in pencil and inclose words which' are not in the George
Brown draft. The paper itself absolutely proves, therefore,
that the original specification was written in ink just as it
now stands in the Patent Office, and as it was copied into the
patent March 7, 1876.
The stress of the argument 'for the Drawbaugh and Overland companies on this point turned on one particular passage.
The George Brown draft, made in-November, 1875, described
various instruments which would produce the patented undulations, but all of them did it by "inductive" action. The
patent as issued states that they can also be produced by varying the resistance, which is not an "inductive" action. One
passage in the George Brown draft reads:
"There are many ways of producing undulatory currents of
electricity, but all of them depend for effect upon tlie vibrations or motions of bodies capable of inductive action."
Our opponents argue, and rightly, that an inventor who had
described the variable resistance liquid transmitter contrivance
in his specification would not write in it that "all" of the contrivances depended on "inductie "'action.
The patknt, on the other hand, reads:
"There are many ways of producing undulatory currents of
electricity, dependent for effect upon the vibrations or motions
of bodies capable of inductive action."

'256

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for. American Bjell Telephone Co.

That statement is true. It is followed by the examples of
"'inductive" *ontrivances which are named i: -the George
Brown draft and which are "dependent" on inductive action,
and, after .them, there follows in the patent the description of
the variable resistance liquid contrivance, which does not
depend upon inductive action.
Our opponents argue that the change in this passage from
-" all of them depend," found in the November, 1875, George
lBrown dh'aft, to "dependent," the words of the patent, marks
the instant when Mr. Bell put the liquid transmitter into his
:specification.. We agree with -them. When was it?
T-hey say that the application, filed February 14, was in the
George Brown language: that between February 15 and 19,
Mr. Bell's solicitors stole the liquid transmitter from Gray's
caveat and wrote it into Bell's application, but-did not observe
this telltale statement on another page of the paper. But
Bell, they say, re-reading the dishonest specification on February 7, perceived. this proof of the dishonest interpolation,
and, ir pencil,-changed "all of which depend" to "dependent." The Dowd print again does not show what is in ink
and what is interlined in pencil, but the original Boston exhibit does. Here is a fac-siinile from it, the interlineation and
-thecancellation of "ent" being in pencil:

.Their contention is that what is in ink in the Boston exhibit
constituted the application before Mr. Bell could have dishonestly toi.hed it, and exactly as it remained on April 10, 1879.1

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

They are right in that. So the very paper to which they
appeal proves upon their own theory, when the original is
looked at, that this telltale phrase which establishes the contemporaneous presence of the liquid transmitter clause was in
the application as filed February 14, 1876, and was written
before the Gray caveat existed, and was not interlined by
Mr. Bell afterwards. The whole story of forgery by the
solicitors and interpolation by Mr. Bell is disproved the
moment the paper they rely on is looked at. Their infamous
charge of fraud is not only false, but it is based on the errors
of a printed copy after they had been warned, and had
agreed, that that copy was a misprint and contained those
very errors in printing.
TLie ease at large.- Eleven years ago Mr. Bell-asserted that
he was the first inventor of the electric speaking telephone
and claimed for his invention and for his patent the same
breadth and scope we insist upon. The Patent Office and
many Circuit Courts have examined those claims in the
most exhaustive and protracted litigation to which any patent
ever gave rise. All his claims have invariably been sustained.
Every tribunal in the Patent Office, and twelve judges in six
circuits have entered judgment in his favor. The record before this court consists of twenty-two printed volumes, containing all the testimony in all the cases ever tried under this
patent which have reached a final hearing. Some of these
cases -

as the Spencer and Dowd cases -

have not been ap-

pealed, but their whole record has been put by our opponents,
with our consent, into other cases which have been appealed.
In the same way, substantially all the evidence that the Patent
Office passed upon in the interferences between Mr. Bell and
various claimants of his inventions is in these records. All
these courts and the Patent Office, and every tribunal anywhere in Christendom before whom the question has come
whether Mr. Bell was the first invenltor of the speaking teleThe brief of his partner, Mr. Dixon, pp. 217-230, is also based on the
assumption that the 1879 copy is a fac-simile of the actual paper thus
existing on the files in respect of what is fair-written in ink and what is
interlined in pencil.

phone, both in this country and abroad, has always decided
that he was.
Vhat the -ElectricSpeaking Telephone is.- Here is a string
telephone, a contrivance at least two hundred years old. It
consists of two tin tubes, A and B, generally two or three
inches long, each with bladders, 0 and E, stretched over one
end. A string, D, has one end-passed through the centre of
each diaphragm, and tied with'a knot inside. The instruments
are drawn apart until the string is stretched tight. A person
speaks into one tube, as A, and the listener who places the
other tube, B, to his ear, hears what is said. The sound vibrations produced by the voice in A cause its diaphragm to copy
their vibratory motions. As this diaphragm C in its vibrations tugs at or relaxes the pull of the connecting string D,
it pulls and relaxes alternately the diaphragm E, and thus
compels it to copy the motions of the diaphragm 0. The

diaphragm E, thus vibrating to and fro, throws the air inside of the tube B into the same vibrations, and those vibratory motions in the air strike upon the drum of the listener's
ear. As the sensation of sound is due to vibrations in the
air, and as the difference between one sensation and another
is due to the difference in vibrations, it follows, and is a wellknown fact, that the utterance of one word produces one
particular set of vibrations, which, falling on the ear of the
listener, produce the sensation of that word, and the utterance of another word produces a different set of air vibrations which, acting on the listener's ear, excite "in him the
sensation of that different word. In the case of the string
telephone the vibrations excited in the air by the word "yes"
in A cause similar vibrations to take place in the diaphragm

consequence is that the air vibrations in B which impinge on
the listener's ear are not only caused by the voice of the
speaker, but they are the sarne i2 "kind" or characteras the
vibrations made in A by the speaker's vocal organs. The listener at B, therefore, acted on by vibrations exactly like those
in A, is conscious of the sensation of the same word that he
would be conscious of if he listened at A.

Mechanically, this contrivance consists of two diaphragms
made to vibrate at stations distant from each other by causing
the movements of the one to compel the other to copy the
motions of the first. That when the second diaphragm was
compelled to copy the movements of the first in all respects,
the word uttered against one would be heard to proceed from
the other, was thus a fact long known and used. No one in
our time can claim any originality for discovering that.
What makes the second diaphragm copy the vibrations of
the first is the ,nechanical connection by a string or wire.
These instruinentg are called "mechanical" telephones, or
"string" telephones If, now, electricity can be employed to
make the second diaparagm copy the motions of the first, we
shall have an "electrio" speaking telephone. The problem
left for the inventor of the first "electric" speaking telephone
was, to discover how electio T could be employed to establish that connection and make the motions of the second diaphragm copy those of the first. That was his whole problem.
The invention consists, therefore, in finding out how electricity
can be used to accomplish that purposQ. To state as iReis, an
alleged anticipator of Bell, did, that if he could by electricity
make a distant diaphragm copy the motions of one spoken to
he would reproduce the sound, was not a statement of an
invention, but a statement of what everybody knew was
desired but had not been invented.
To produce at the ear of the listener, whether he be within
earshot or at the end of a telephone line, the sensation of a
particular word uttered by the speaker, it is not enough that
the voice of the speaker at the sending station should produce
some vibrations at the receiving station; it must there produce vibrat~ons which shall have the characteristic motions

belonging.to that particular word as distinguished from those
which belong to any other word. "Sound waves," as they
are generally called, consist of zones of alternate condensation
and rarefaction, produced at one place and:propagating themselves onward. These condensations and rarefactions, however, are directly due to extremely short (perhaps 0.00001 of
an inch), to-and -fro vibratory movements of the air particles,
and it is usually more convenient to study those motions
directly. Sonorous vibrations may vary, and therefore differ
from each other, in several respects. The length of the path
over which the vibrating air particle passes in its to-and-fro
motion, or, as it is called, the ampitude of the vibration, may
vary; the time occupied in passing over its total path from
the beginning of one swing back to its starting point, or
the number of times it will pass over it in- a second,
called the rate ok period of vibration, may vary. The amplitude of the vibration determines the loudness of the
sound; the rate, period or frequency of this vibration determines the pitch of the sound. But the differences between
one word and another, or between the sound of a flute
and of the human voice, for example, are not differences
of loudness nor differences of pitch. The third characteristic of sound, which ena:les us to distinguish sounds from
each other and recognize them, independently of pitch and
loudness, is called "quality," a word here used with a specialized, technical meaning. It includes the difference between
articulate sounds or different words as part of it. It depends,
not upon the length of the path of the vibrating particle, nor
on the frequency with which it passes over that path, but
upon the manner in which itperforms its journey. If it were
to start from a definite point at a definite time, and return to
the same point at the end of a definite time-that is, if it
were strictly limited as to the amplitude and as to the period
of its complete vibration -it
might (and does) pass over that
path in many different ways; it may move at first fast, then
slow, then perhaps return a little, and then go on at a different
speed, and still reach the same goal at the same time. It is
the difference in the manner in which it performs its journey,

TELEPHONE CASES.

Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

as distinguished from the length of its journey, and from the
time occupied, which gives rise to difference in the "quality"
of the resulting sound. To produce the sensation of a word
by vibrating at a distant station the diaphragm of a telephone, it is necessary, therefore, to make that diaphragm perform vibrations which, in their "character," as it is called, as
distinguished from their frequency and their amplitude, correspond to that particular word. If we know how to produce
this kind of control over the vibrations at the distant diaphragm, we shall know how to transmit speech; if we do not
know how to do it, then we shall not know how to make a
speaking telephone.
The invention of Mr. Bell consisted in finding out how to so
employ electricity that not only would the voice of the speaker
produce some vibrations in the moving part of the distant instrument, but would produce vibrations which in, tlher character or "kind" would copy the movements caused in the air by
the utterance of whatever word might be spoken for the
moment at the transmitter.
There had long been known an instrument called the ]Reis
telephone, in which words uttered into the transmitter did, by
means of electricity, produce motions in the receiver. It was
the most advanced instrument in those arts to which the speaking telephone pertains. But the motions thus produced in the
receiver of the Reis telephone copied those of the transmitter
only as respects the characteristic of period or frequency. The
same number of complete swings as were performed by the
transmitter at one end were performed by the receiver at the
other, but the characterof the swings at one end did not control the "character" of the vibrational swings at the other.
That characteristic of sound which depends upon the number
of vibrations per second, to wit, musical pitch, was therefore
reproduced by this instrument; but the characteristic of sound
which depends upon the characterof vibration, or, as it is technically called, "forn," of vibration, to wit, " guality," including
those peculiarities which constitute articulation, was not reproduced by this instrument, and Could not be reproduced by any
instrument' operating upon its principle. The distinction be-

tween this old musical telephone an4 the speaking telephone
described in the Bell patent, consist, therefore, essentially in
the difference of method or principle employed as well as in
the difference in the kind of result produced. The method of
Reis secured correspondence in frequency of vibration or pitch
of soiund, but did not secure, and could not secure, anything
else. All the experts on both sides agree that this method
was absolutely inadequate for speech, and was not only inadequate, but, while that method was being employed, the method
adequate for speech could not be used at the same time in the
same instrument.
It is obvious that that which particularly made Mr. Bell's
instrument to be an" elecs'ic speaking telephone was some
electrical action not exhibited in the operation of the previous
instrument which enabled it to control the character, as distinguisbed from the mere frequency, of the vibrations of the
receiver diaphragm. In that electrical action will be found,
therefore, his most, important and characteristic novelty, and
his leading patentable invention.
To signify that characteristic of sonorous vibration which
gives rise to "quality " of sound as distinguished from loudness
or pitch, the patent employs some technical phraseology of
long known meaning. It is the habit of physicists to represent
sound vibrations in a sort of graphic shorthand way by drawing curves which are not drawings of the movements actually
made by the sounding body, but which are a graphical representation of a mental conception of the character of those
movements. In the same way, the height of the thermometer
or barometer at successive times, or the price of stocks or gold
or cotton, is represented by curves which to the instructed
mind tell a long story at a glance. From this habit there has
arisen a scientific slang or technical term, -"form of vibration." It is used because each different "character" of vibration
is represented by a particular characteristic of the curve which
typifies it, and this particular characteristic, although it is not
the only one shown in what would popularly be called the
"shape" of the curve, is scientifically recognized as constituting what is called in acoustics its "form."
Helnholtz, and

all the other standard writers for many years before the Bell
patent, employed the phrase "fon'i of vibration" to signify
that characteristic upon which "quality" or articulation depends; and the Bell patent, adopting this established use of
the word, employs it to signify the reproduction of that particular characteristic of vibration.
By a form of speech which is adopted in science and is scientifically correct, the lines which thus graphically express the
idea of sonorous vibrations are called curves, although to the
eye they look jagged and sharp. The following cut is taken

that is, K and K, the two parts of the key, are out of contact,
and no current can flow from the battbry. If the key K is
depressed, so that it touches the end of the wire K', then the
current flows from the battery B through K, K', through the
"line," through the receiving instrument E, down to the earth
or "ground" at G', through the earth to the other "ground,"
G, and up to the battery again. If the key K is raised, the
electrical connection is destroyed by what is called "opening"
the circuit -that is, opening the wires apart - and no current
passes. The receiver E consists of an electro-magnet. That is
composed of two small cylinders of iron, around which are
wound coils of wire which form a part of the electric circuit.
When the key K is depressed so as to touch K', and the current
flows, it passes through these coils. That makes the cores
inside the coils (shown as little cylinders protruding from
their upper ends) to be magnetic while the current flows, and
that pulls down the flat piece of iron or armature, A, iiuspended above those cores by a spiral spring S, and holds it
doWn so long as the current flows. When the key K is raised
to its position shown in the cut, the current is ",broken" and
no longer flows, the cores of the electro-magnet cease to be
magnetic, they no longer attract the armature A, and the
spiral spring draws it up again. Each time, therefore, that
the key K makes contact with its anvil K' the armature A is
pulled down; when the key K is lifted up, the armature A

ausical or "pitch" telephones. - If now the key K be connected with the centre of a horizontal diaphragm which is
vibrated by a sound, it will move up and down, and the parts
can be so adjusted that when it moves down it will make contact with K' and let the current flow, and when it moves up
they will part contact and interrupt the current; each up and
down motion of this diaphragm will thus cause an up and
down motion in the armature A of the receiver. As many
times as the key K vibrates up and down under the influence of words or other sounds, it interrupts the current at
K K', and therefore just so many times will the armature A
vibrate up and down. The vibrating armature, A, will give
forth a sound the pitch of which will depend upon the number of its vibrations per second, and as that number will agree
with the number of interruptions of current caused by the
vibrations of the diaphragm to which K is attached, it follows
that that characteristic of the sound acting on the diaphragm
and attached key at K which depends solely upon the number
of vibrations will be reproduced by the vibratory motions of
the armature A: That characteristic consists simply in musical pitch. This circuit-breaking machine, acting on the receiver
by an interrupted current, will reproduce the musical pitch of
the sound. But it will reproduce no other characteristic; it
cannot therefore' reproduce speech.

piece of soft iron, c (A), called the armature. The lower end
of c (A) is fastened by a stud to the centre of the diaphragm
a ( D. The arm d (E) is of iron, and carries an electro-magnet
b (H), consisting of a small core or cylinder of iron, the end of
which is seen projecting towards c (C in the section), wound
round with a coil of wire (H in the section). The receiving
instrument L is the same as the transmitting instrument, except
that for convenience the cone tapers down from the diaphragm
to the small end which can enter the ear of the listener. When
any sound is made into the cone A, its diaphragm a (M), is
caused to, vibrate in accordance with the particular sound
uttered, just as in the case of a string telephone. The arma-

of that motion. When so vibrating it moves to and fro in

electricity constantly passing through the whole apparatus
from the battery shown by the cross-lines below b.
It is a fact in electricity, discovered by Faraday about 1831,
that when an armature is moved in front of such a magnetized
electro-magnet, that very motion itself generates (" induces"
is the technical word) in the coils of the electro-magnet electrical disturbances which are shown as currents in telegraph
wires properly connected, and that these disturbances or currents correspond to the movements of the armature in duration,
in direction, and in strength. While the armature moves, these
"induced" currents, as they are called, flow; when the armature, instead of moving towards the core moves away from the
core, the direction of the so-called electrical flow is reversed.
When the armature moves violently, the electric current is violent; and when gently, the flow is gentle. While the armature c (A), is made to vibrate to and fro in front of this electro-magnet by the action of sound vibrations or waves on the
diaphragm, electrical disturbances or currents are all the while
caused, but these vary from instant to instant as the motion of
the armature varies, and, therefore, the variations in the flow
correspond to the variations in that movement, in duration,
in direction, and in violence. In accordance with the habitual
usage of science, they may be, and are properly said to be,
copies of the vibrational movements of the armature; that is,
every change in one produces a corresponding change in the
other.
When this current, varying in accordance with the sound
waves that act on the transmitter, reaches the electro-magnet
f of the receiver, it acts upon the core of that magnet, in front

of which is the -armature A. The current from the battery
always keeps that core somewhat magnetic, and therefore

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

always pulls the armature A towards the little cylindrical core
projecting fromf. If the magnetic pull of f be increased, the
armature A, and consequently the diaphragm i attached to it,
is drawn nearer to f; if the magnetic pull be relaxed, the
elasticity of the diaphragm draws A back again. Every variation in the magnetic strength of the core produces, therefore,
a motion in the armature A and attached diaphragm i. It
not only produces some motion, but produces a motion which
corresponds at each instant with the variations in the magnetic strength of the core. The greater these variations, the
more violent the motion; when the magnetic strength increases, the movement of the armature is towards the electromagnet; when it decreases, the movement is in the other
direction. The currents produced in the manner already stated,
and varying like the sound waves of the sound uttered into
the transmitter, reach the receiver electro-magnet f, by viriue
of the well-known fact that every electrical change produced
at one end of a telegraph wire is instantly felt in every part
of it. These currents, corresponding to the sound waves
which act on the transmitter, are added to the general and
steady current from the battery, so that the total actual
current passing through the electro-magnet of the receiver is
now stronger, now weaker, in exact accordance with those
sound waves. - The stronger it is, the more magnetic is the
coref; the weaker it is, the less magnetic is that core; and as
the movements of the armature h depend upon and correspond
to and copy the magnetic changes of the core f, 'and as
these magnetic changes are due to and correspond to n d copy
the changes in the electrical current, so it follows that the
vibratory movements of the armature I and attached diaphr.agm i of the receiver copy the changes in the electrical
current. Every variation in that current produces not only
some variation, but a corresponding variation in the vibratory
motions of the armature A and diaphragm i.
It is evident upon reflebtion that all this correspondence
between the movements of the diaphragm a and armature c
of -the transmitter and the currents its movemnefits cause, and
this correspondence between those currents- a.d the move-

ments of the armature A and diaphragm i of the receiver L
which the currents in turn produce, holds not only for the
greater and general disturbances and changes, but for each
minute variation or variety of them. The consequence is that
in this apparatus the electrical changes are copies of the sonorous movements at the transmittingend. The sonorous movements at the 'eceiving end are copies of these electrical changes.
They are therefore copies of the sonorous movements at the
transmitting end of which these electrical changes themselves
are copies. The final consequence is that the vibratory movements at the receiver are the same as those in the transmitter,
not only as respects general frequency, bat as regards all their
characteristics; and the result is that the sound which actu-.
ates the transmitter is reproduced and heard to proceed from
the receiver with all its characteristics, and not with the
.characteristic of its pitch alone. This instrument, therefore,
is an instrument which can reproduce not merely the characteristic of pitch, but all the characteristics of sound; or, to
state it in a more ordinary, concrete form, it will transmit not
only musical notes but "noises and sounds of all kinds."
That is the telephone Fig. 7 of the patent, usually called
the magneto telephone.
Comparing this with a string telephone we find that we have,
in each, a diaphragm spoken to at one end and a diaphragm
listened to at the other, and that, in each, speech is transmitted
because the motions of the latter are copies of the motions of
the former. But in Wr. Bell's telephone we have got rid of
the mere mechanical connection or link formed by the string,
and have employed electricity to connect the two. The knowledge how to use electricity for this link constitutes the invention of the electric speaking telephone.
It will be observed that, in the nature of things, the movements of the receiver copy the electrical changes which produce them, and necessarily must copy them, in any receiver
where the attraction bn the elastic diaphragm varies with the
amount of electricity which arrives from the transmitter. Any
form of instrument of which that holds true can therefore be
substituted for Mr. Bell's precise structure without changing

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

the apparatus as a whole, or its mode of operation, or its
result. Those motions at the receiver are like the sound
waves uttered into the transmitter, be6ause the electrical
changes which move the receiver, and which therefore its
motions copy, are themselves copies of the sound waves uttered into the transmitter. What makes this apparatus to
be an electrical machine is the employment of electricity in
some form; but what makes it to be an electrical speaking
machine is the presence, not only of s'ome electrical current,
but of an electrical current which copies the sonorous movements of the transmitter in those characteristics on which
"quality" or articulation depends. In other words, in the
figurative language of science, the electricity is here moulded
into the form of the sound waves, and when that feature is
present in the operation of the machine, speech will be transmitted; when it is not present, speech will not be transmitted.
It is present in this apparatus of Mr. Bell's; his specification
contains the first description of any apparatus which was ever
intended or adapted to embody this idea and the first suggestion of the idea itself. This correspondence between the electrical current and the sound waves acting at the -transmitting
end, therefore, is exactly that which makes Bell's instrument a
speaking telephone, and which, beyond any peculiarities of
structure, distinguishes it in principle and idea from anything
ever known before.
The Bell patent points out that this is the distinctive characteristic to which the new result is due; and claim 5 of the
patent in terms secures to him this "method" as the means
for the desired results.
The following is the description in the patent. After describing the use of one specified undulatory current apparatus,
(Fig. 5) for the purpose of harmonic telegraphy, the patent
says:
"I desire here to remark that there are many other uses to
which these instruments may be put, such as the simultaneous
transmission of musical notes, differing in loudness as well as
in pitch, and the telegraphic transmission of voices or sounds
of any kind."

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

He then proceeds to state how this latter result can be accomplished.
"One of the ways in which the armature a, Fig. 5," [the
telegraph instrument], "may be set in vibration, has been
stated above to be by wind. Another mode is shown in
Fig. ',whereby motion can be imputed to the armature by
the human voice, or by means of a musical instrument.

"The armature c,Fig. 7,is fastened loosely by one extremity
to the uncovered leg d of the electro-magnet b, and its other
extremity is attached to the centre of a stretched membrane
a. A cone, A, is used to converge sound vibrations upon the
membrane. When a sound is uttered in the cone, the membrane a is set in vibration, the armature o is forced to partake
of the motion, and thus electrical undulations are created
upon the circuit E b ef g. These undulations are similar
in form to the air vibrations caused by the sound: that is,
they are represented graphically by similar curves. The undulatory current passing through the electro-magnet f, influences its armature h to copy the motion of the armature c.
A similarsound to that uttered into A is then heard to _proceedfrom L. "
"Claim 5. The method of and apparatus for transmitting
vocal or other sounds telegraphically, as herein described, by
causing electricalundulations, similar inform to the vibration&
of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds, substantially as set forth."
Professor George F. Barker, expert for the Overland company, characterized the invention very happily. He was of
those who witnessed Mr. Bell's exhibition at the Centennial.
He spoke of the interest excited by "the remarkable result"
and their astonishment at hearing "for the first time the trans-

mission of articulate speech electrically." He added :"The
mode of operation of the instrument was obvious at once as
soon as it was exhibited. It was one of those marvellously
simple inventions that causes one to wonder, on seeing it, that
it had not been invented long before."
Every speaking telephone used by all the defendants differs
from every instrument before the Bell patent, and resembles
the instrument of the Bell patent, in that it has these electrical
changes which are copies of the sound waves. It transmits
speech because it has them. That principle, that "method,"
and that mode of operation first came into the world in Mr.
Bell's instrument and by the description in his patent. His
was a speaking telephone because it had it; previous instruments could not be speaking telephones because they did not
have it. It is in the defendants' apparatus, and it is because
they have it that their instruments talk.
,
These electrical changes are not something that existed in
nature and 'he found. He first created them. They are not
the "result" which Mr. Bell sought to attain; the "result"
is the transmission of noises and sounds of all kinds. They are
the essential means to that result; and they are novel. The
defendants' instruments owe their capacity to transmit speech
to the employment of that means which is in common between
them and Mr. Bell, and is not in common between them and
any one who preceded Mr. Bell. There is no better test of
infringement. tlowe v. .Morton, 1 Fish. Pat. Cas. 586, 588.
To this, Dolbear makes an objection. He says Mr. Bell
cannot cover "all" ways of transmitting speech. We reply
that our patent does not cover "all" ways, but 'only our
way. "But," rejoins Mr. Dolbear, "I cannot find any other
way, and I do not believe any other is possible. Your patent
only appears to cover one way; yet, if there is no other way,
you cover all ways. O'Reilly v. Yorse, 15 How. 62, does not
permit that."
In deciding the Dolbear case at the circuit, Mr. Justice Gray
answered this argmnent. He said:
"The evidence in this case clearly shows that Bell discovered
that articulate sounds- could be transmitted by undulatory

TELEPHONE CASES.

vibrations of electricity, and he invented the art or process of
transmitting such sounds by means of such vibrations. - If that
art or process is (as the witnesses called for the defendant say
it is) the only way by which speech can be transmitted by
electricity, that fact does not lessen the merit of his invention
or the protection which the law will give to it."
It is said in defence that the Reis circuit-breaker and several
old instruments can qow be compelled to so operate as to produce this peculiar character of electrical disturbance, and if
they produce it they will talk; and that speech can now be
transmitted by -talkingto a Morse or a House telegraph. But
that is not material, if true. If Mr. Bell in IS76 had said: "I
,can make the Morse telegraph perform a new kind of operation, and produce a new kind of electrical changes, and by so
doing I can transmit speech," and had told how, he would have
improved the useful arts by inventive genius; he would have
made a patentable invention. Ile could not patent the machine, for the Morse telegraph was old. ie could patent his
new mode of electrical operation, and that mode of electrical
operation could only be described by pointing out the essential
difference between the electrical changes that Morse produced
and the electrical changes that Bell produced.
This court has given a perfect description of such an invention in the Fat Acids case (Tilkrna&v. Proctor, 102 U. S.
707). A man, said the court, may have a patent for "the means
by him invented and described," and those means need not be
a machine. What is the difference between a machine and a
process'? "A machine," said this court, "is something visible
to the eye, the object of perpetual observation. A process is a
conception of the mind, known only by its results wheD, being
executed or performed. Either may be the means of producing a useful result." Either, therefore, may be a patentable
means. When my opponents say "What, patent a conception?
Patent a result? Patent an operation which you cannot know
except by its results ?" the reply is obvious.
An inventor, until he has not only got a conception, but has
described how that conception can be so applied and employed
as to lead to a result, - "be known by a result," - has not

made his work a part of the useful arts; has not come within
the language of this court; nor within the domain of the patent law. But when he has entered into the useful arts, and
thereby got within the domain of the patent law, then one
must be very blind and very narrow-minded who can see
only the machine visible to the eye, and not the conception
which gives life to it. That is the lesson of the Fat Acids
case.
Is there any better statement of the great inventions that
have improved the useful arts, than "a new idea introduced "?
In the Clay case, the defendants' counsel below said that this
whole Bell patent and all the stories its counsel told about
it were pure pieces of imagination; that they were asking the
court to base its decrees upon nothing but imagination. "Why,"
said he in substance,!"they talk about a 'form' of electrical
undulations, and they say that there is a 'form' of electrical
disturbances in their instrument, and the same 'form' in ours,"
and he pulled a piece of crooked wire out of his pocket, and
said, "I can see the form of this, and if a man brings me
another one I can see the form of that, and if the form of the
electrical 'undulations is the same in those two instruments,
why does not the Bell company pull them out and put them
on the table, that the court may compare them?"
Apply that criticism to the great invention of Faraday which
he described in his imaginative phrase "Lines of Force;" apply
it to the decision in the Fat Acids case; it only destroys the
critic. What is there so real, so enduring, or so useful as
a new idea so stated that it can be employed and lead to a
practical, useful result? There is no better statement of a
great patentable invention- a new idea so stated that it can
be employed and lead to a practically useful result; a new idea
harnessed into the service of man. The harness is indeed
requisite to use the idea, but the great thing, and the fruitful
thing, is the new idea which is brought in.
The Patent Act, in express terms, says that the inventor is
to describe his machine, and "the principle" thereof, "by
which it may be distinguished from other inventions." The
"principle" is the distinguishing characteristic in the patent

law.

The Act again formulates this idea still more explicitly.

He is to describe, says the Act, "the best mode in which he
has contemplated applying that principle," implying that there
may be modes of application not described. And, with that

This court has often spoken of the value of the mental idea
which lies behind a particular machine, the first of its class in
the arts. Bisehqf v. lMethered, 9 Wall. 812. There is no
illustration of that better than Faraday's great discovery that
waving a magnet in front of an electro-magnet or a wire,
generates electrical currents. That magnet, moved by his
hand, was the first magneto machine that ever was. He discovered that fact; but that fact was only a small part of what
he discovered. Bie discovered the relation between, the motions
and the currents, and he expressed that relation by a figure of
speech - by the phrase "Lines of Force." If he had died on
the day after he had so announced that discovery; the world

would have been as much indebted to hin as it is now. For
though he had not then worked out all of its results, he
had given the rule for doing it. Every man who makes a
dynamo machine to-day, in calculating its form, its proportions, and its parts, to fit it for the particular use he wants,
not only avails himself of the fact that Faraday discovered,
but of the rule that Faraday laid down for all future constructors. He did the work of the originator as distinguished
from the work of the improver.
So it is with this specification of Mr. Bell. It certainly
-described one speaking telephone. But its greatest merit was
that it also laid down the rule for all future speaking telephones. It said, - get into the operation of your machine
this *hich never was in any machine before, and get it in in
-accordance with a particular rule which it stated. Every man
who has endeavored to improve the speaking telephone since
that time, has endeavored not only to avail himself of the fact
that Mr. Bell found, but has endeavored to conform more and
more perfectly to the rule which Mr. Bell laid down.
One of my opponents said that it seemed to him that this
whole telephone system was like a pyramid balanced on its
apex; that this vast system all over the world to-day was
based on this one little imperfect machine in the Bell patent.
"Great oaks from little acorns grow," answers the nursery

variations of strength corresponds to those vibrations, may be
patentable themselves as improvements, but 'would still give
an apparatus which as a whole employs Mr. Bell's method.
The microphone transmitter is such a variation of form. The
strength of an electric current can be varied by varying the

electric energy poured into the circuit, or by varying the
obstruction or electrical resistance which that energy has to
overcome, just as the flow of gas in a pipe can be varied by
varying the pressure at the gas works, or by turning more or
less the cock which obstructs and regulates the flow. In the
case of electricity the relation is simple, and was ascertained
and expressed by Ohm (whence it is called Ohm's law) in the

The "microphone" is an apparatus which so varies the

device exhibited for this purpose by Emil Berliner
in his caveat of April 14 and application of June
4, 1877. The line D represents a diaphragm, shown
edgewise, supported by a framework at its edges. C ;
is a pointed "electrode" or wire-end held in contact
with the central part of the diaphragm. The current
from the battery B goes by the wire to the diaphragm D,
thence to the electrode C through the point of contact, thence
through the receiver R (a Bell receiver, essentially like L of
Fig. 7, but in the improved form of Bell's second patent).
When the diaphragm D is vibrated by sound waves it moves
towards the electrode C, or in the opposite direction. A movement towards C increases the pressure at the point of contact,
and a movement in the opposite direction diminishes it.
In an uncut wire the electric current (the phrase by which
the phenomenon of the propagation of electricity is expressed)
passes from molecule to molecule with ease. If the wire be
cut, and the two ends placed in contact, it will still pass, but
less freely than before, because the union of the molecules of
the two severed ends is less perfect than in the urncut wire. If
the two ends (or "electrodes") are firmly pressed together,
the union is more perfect, and the current experiences less resistance and is less enfeebled than if they touch lightly. This

was a fact well known before the Bell patent, though such
variations in pressure had never been directly utilized. In our
microphone, therefore,, the vibrations of the diaphragm will
produce variations of pressure at the contact, and consequent
variations of electrical resistance, and, consequently, corresponding variations of current.' This microphone may therefore be substituted for the transmitter A of Bell's Fig. 7,
and the vibrations of its diaphragm, like those of the diaphragm of A, will produce electrical undulations similar in
form to the actuating air vibrations. The same effect will be
produced on the receiver as in Fig. 7, and the word will be
transmitted 'by the method of the patent.
The. chief mechanical essentials of the microphone are,
(1) that there shall be no substantial break of contact, such as
would be caused by the diaphragm vibrating entirely away
from the electrode; (2) that variations of pressure shall be
V
developed to as great an extent as possible; (3) that
the variations of electrical resistance shall directly and
uniformly correspond to the variations of pressure.
Berliner's first papers show the electrode C made of
German silver or other metal, and held rigidly, while
the diaphragm was much strained, so that its excursions
would be 'very small. Edison, who invented the microphone independently, showed in his application of July
20, 1877, a fQrm indicated by this diagram.
The electrode C is mounted on the end of an adjustable
spring E, strained by the screw F to press towards the diaphragm. Afterwards he discovered that it was better to give
a notable weight to a spring-carried electrode, 0, because, while
the spring gave an automatic freedom of adjustment, the inertia of the weight furnished a mechanical resistance which developed a large variation of contact pressure. He also in his
application of July 20, 1877, and in a previous newspaper publiIt is a well-known law of electricity that electrical variations produced

cation, pointed out that carbon was the best material for one
or both of the variable pressure electrodes. The reasons are
that with carbon the range of variation of pressure without
sudden break is greater, and the variations of electrical conductivity correspond more closely and evenly to the variations
of pressure than when the usual metals alone are employed.
Early in 1878 Professor Hughes, in England, independently
invented the carbon microphone in a very simple but excellent
form, and gave it its name, "microphone." Finally, in the
summer and fall of 1878, Mr. Francis Blake, formerly an officer in charge of the electrical determinations of longitude for
the United States coast survey, and now a director of the Bell
company, invented the highly organized Blake transmitter.

All these inventors did, in fact, make their microphones

waves. They do produce such undulations, and for that
reason their use has always been decided to infringe Mr. Bell's
fifth claim.
MIr. Bell, moreover, in the patent itself, stated explicitly that
the described variations of current could be produced by varying the electrical resistance instead of employing the magneto
transmitter particularly shown, and he indicated a type of
instrument (the liquid transmitter) which could be used to
vary the resistance.' It is, however, the microphonic form of'
variable resistance instrument which is now generally commercially used. The Bell patent covers the use of a telephone
apparatus which employs a microphone for its transmitting
member, because the novel variations of current which constitute the essence of the Bell invention are employed as the
essential means of transmitting speech by the microphonic
form, as well as by the magneto form; and if Mr. Bell had
described nothing but the magneto form, his claim would
have that breadth. That it does have that breadth, however,
is put beyond discussion, for the patent itself states that for
its purposes the -ariable resistance mode is the equivalent of
the magneto mode.
The following is the usual commercial form of the Bell
magneto instrument invariably used as a receiver, and to some
substantial extent also used. as a transmitter:
I After describing the magneto or "inductive" plan the patent says:
"Electrical unduhitions may also be caused by alternately increr3ing and
diminishing the resistance of the circuit. . . . For instance, let mercury or
some other liquid form part of a voltaic circuit; then, the more deeply the
conducting wire is immersed in the mercury or other liquid, the less resistance does the liquid offer to the passage of the current. Hence the vibration of the conducting wire in mercury or other liquid included in the circuit occasions undulations in the current."
Claim 5 was for his "method" as a whole. Besides that, he had one
special and subordinate claim (3i) for the inductive mode of working that
method, and another special and subordinate claim (4) for the variable
resistance mode of working it.
Claim 4. "The method of producing undulations in a continuous voltaic
circuit, by gradually increasing and diminishing the resistance of the circuit or by gradually increasing and diminishig the power of the battery,

The origin of the Elebie .peaking Telephone. - There are
more than half a million of these telephones in daily use.
They are so simple that anybody can make them, and anybody can use them. Where did they come from? Trace back
the history of each one of them. Go to the man who made
it, and ask him where he learned how an electric'telephone
must work in order to speak. Go to the man who put the
last improvement into it, and ask him where he found a speaking telephone to improve, and where he learned the rule to
improve it by. All these lines of search end in one man.
Whatever anybody did or did not do secretly in his workshop before Mr. Bell's time, it is nevertheless a fact in history that every speaking telephone at work in the world traces
its origin right up to Mr. Bell. No man ever used, and no
man offered for use, any instrument for the purpose of transmitting intelligence by word of mouth for any practical or
useful end, before-Mr. Bell. There is no such pretence. Yet
it is an invention which once known could not be kept secret,
and when offered, every one wanted it.
There is no better way to find the origin of so striking
an improvement in the useful arts, than to ascertain where
it was that everybody learned it. When 'Mr. Bell exhibited
his instrument at the Centennial, all the learned men and all

the practical men, said, "This is a new and unheard-of thing."
They did not say he had got a new way of doing 4n old thing;
they said that the transmission of speech at all by electricity
.
was a novelty. They went further than that. They said, "We
know Reis and his publications; we know that the community
got no speaking telephone from his work. Now that Mr. -Bell
has told us the true way, we see why his predecessors failed."
This was the verdict of Professor Henry and his fellow judges
at the Centennial, of the British Association, the American
Academy, the Society of Telegraph Engineers, the French
Academy of Sciences, of an assemblage in New York of all the
men most prominent in commercial telegraphy and in science.,
No man denied it until the great commercial success of Ar.
Bell's invention aroused infringers to assert in 1881 that publi-.
cations in which no man up to that time had ever found a
speaking telephone, could now be sworn to by experts as
containing one.
The .Reis Telel)one. - Philip Reis, in Germany, attempted
about 1855 to make an electric speaking telephone, and in 1861
first exh'.bited it and described it in print. From 1861 to
1874, he brought it extensively to the notice of scientific
men and the public by exhibitions before scientific societies
in Germany, and before the British Association in England.
It was exhibited to the American Association in 1869 and
1870. In 1863 he advertised his instruments for sale, and,
until the present time, they have been on sale by the principal

from the form he adopted in 1863. He stated in his advertisements that that form satisfied all his expectations, and that
with it unskilled persons could repeat all of his experiments.
From 1861 until these suits began, the structure and operation
of the apparatus were described by Reis, by Koenig and the
other makers in their catalogues, by the principal standard
.writers on electricity and acoustics, and in the scientific-and
other periodicals. The instruments themselves were found in

TELEPHONE CASES.
Air. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

the cabinets of the Smithsonian and other institutions. His
work, therefore, whatever it was, was perfectly well known.
The best instrument makers applied their skill to the construction of his machine in accordance with his directions, and eminent scientific men personally experimented with it and publishtd their results. Fifty such publications between 1861 and
1877 are in the record. If the thing was not known as a
speaking telephone, it was not because it was not known, but
because it was not a speaking telephone.
We assert that it was simply a circuit-breaking contrivance
such as we have already described, reproducing the musical
pitch of sounds, but not reproducing "quality" or articulation.
The actual standing of the instrmnent in the hands of the
community is conclusive. Reis's own publications and conduct
express that standing. In the prospectus furnished with the
completed instrument of 1863, and from 1863 until his death
in 1874, he advertised it as a contrivance which would reproduce the pitch of sounds made by the voice or any musical
instrument, but did not pretend or suggest that the listener
could ever recognize words. It was never offered, nor bought,
nor attempted to be used by any purchaser as a speaking telephone, but only as a philosophical toy for the reproduction of
pitch. This is not controverted. When Bell exhibited his
apparatus scientific men hailed it as the first speaking telephone, and contrasted it with the Reis, saying that Reis tried
to make a speaking telephone, but only produced a musical
telephone or pitch trafismitter. Neither Reis's well-known
actual work nor the many publications about it ever did in
fact give the art of transmitting speech to the community.
Reis did not pretend that they would. There can be no higher
proof of their insufficiency in fact and in law.
The history as read in the publications themselves by the
unscientifie'reader is equally conclusive. In 1861 Reis made
his first public exhibition and lecture. Of this there are two
accounts. One, published in the local papers at the time, said,
"Up to the present the reproduction of the tones is indeed
weak and words cannot be reproduced. We leave here the
question as to whether this hereafter will be successfully
accomplished."

OCTOBER TERML 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

Some months later Reis wrote out his lecture and published
it. He said that he had hoped. to transmit speech, but had
been disappointed, adding: "Hitherto it has not been possible
to reproduce the tones of human speech with a distinctness
sufficient for every one. The consonants are for the most part
reproduced pretty distinctly, but the vowels are as yet not in
an equal degree." That is the strongest statement Reis ever
made. Subsequent experience led him in all his later papers
to claim for it the transmission of pitch alone.
A writer, during the next year (1862), professing to speak
of trials by others heard of at second hand, and not trials by
himself, said that "the experimenters could even reproduce
words, although indeed only such as had been often heard by
them." This is the only intimation anywhere in literature, of
the transmission of a single word. *It is not legal evidence of
any such fact. Seymour v. _Xe C'ormick, 19 How. 107. Experimenters with telephones know what tricks imagination plays,
and it appears specifically that upon the occasion referred to
the circumstances were such that the transmission of words
was impossible, for the listeners are shown by the publication
itself to have been at such a distance from the instrument
that only the loud, inarticulate sounds due to circuit-breaking could be audible.
On the other hand, the apparatus was universally called
"The music teleograph"; no other writer out of the fifty, including Reis in his later writings, hints at the transmission of
words, while all those who speak from personal experiment
say that it was impossible to transmit them. Thus X -r. Quilling published in :May, 1863, the results of actual experiments
by Reis which he had just witnessed, saying: "It was not
possible with the present construction of the apparatus to
transmit spoken words." Pisco, in his standard treatise on
"Acoustic Apparatus" (Vienna, 1865), says, as the result of
a long series of experiments with it, that "the only meang
for the transmission of speech is the old speaking tube." Xr.
-Ladd,a celebrated instrument maker of London, having experimented with an original Reis instrument, under Reis's special instructions, before the British Association in 1863, reports

TELEPHONE CASES.
Air. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

that it will only transmit "musical notes and sounds." E.uhn,
in Handbuch der Angewandten Elektrioiiftslehre(1865), says
that he has experimented with it, but "a reproduction of the
words spoken into the telephone with or without variation of
pitch was audible at the receiver only in a corresponding noise
(entqprechendes Gerdusch), while a discriminate perception of
single vocal sounds, syllables or words could not be had."
An elaborate series of experiments with it were carried on
by Reis and Professor Buff of Giessen, in the laboratory of the
latter in 1863-4. In September, 1864, Reis exhibited it in
that laboratory to the physical section of the German Society
of Natural Sciences. His lecture was not published, but wab
followed on the same afternoon by a lecture by Professor Buff;
this was published at once in Annalen der chernie aqvd 2/harmacie, 1864-5, iii, Suplernentband, p. 134. In it Professor
Buff says of the Reis:
"The arrangement is such that the skin which vibrates in
equal periods with a source of sound acting upon it serves as
a means for interrupting the electric current, which, at a distance, circulates around an iron wire, the ends of which are
clamped upon a resonating plate. Unfortunatel r by this
otherwise ingenious arr ,ngement, the pitch only of musical
tones within several octaves, but not the quality ( Wollaut) of
the same could so far be transmitted through wire circuits."
All this agrees with the actual history of the instrument in
th6 world. The strongest pretence in favor of Reis is that
.since these suits were brought some men have been found to
testify in them, from a mere memory twenty years old, that
they think they heard words at some private experiments
which were never published. The worthlessness of such
"memories " is shown by the fact that one of the most respectable of those persons-a professor at Heidelburg, says
he remembers that at the occasion of the Buff lecture just
quoted the audience were aroused to a high pitch of enthusiasm by the transmission of speech which the contemporaneous publication of course disproves. But there is not a pretence that the instrument, widely as it was known, was ever
in fact a speaking telephone in the hands of the community.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.

286
'Mr.

StoiTow's Argument for imerican Bell Telephone Co.

This was summed up by the court in Ain. Bell T. Co. v.
pencer, S Fed. Rep. 509, as follows :-"Reis appears to have
been a man of learning and ingenuity He used a membrane
and electrlodes for transmitting sounds, and his apparatus was
well known to curious inquirers. The regret of all its adfnirers was that articulate speech could not be sent and received
by it. The deficiency was inherent in the principle of the
machine. . . . A century of Reis would never have produced a speaking telephone by mere improvement in construction."
The-only method and mode of operation disclosed by the
Reis publications is simple circuit-breaking, which will transmit pitch, but not quality or articulation.
A scientific examination of the published description shows
that the Reis apparatus was not a speaking telephone, because
the principle and mode of operation embodied in it are incapable of transmitting speech. Every publication stated that it
was sim)ly a circuit-breaker interrupting the current with a
frequency corresponding to the pitch of the sound acting upon
it. No other kind of operation is anywhere suggested or
hinted at. Reis himself stated that such was his idea, such
his intention, and such the actual operation of the machine in
his hands. In his description of his latest form he said that
this was "the principle that guided" him, and that he had
carefully "proportioned" the tension of the diaphragm and
the weight of the "hopping" piece to that end. Now this
proportion is the mechanical element which determines the
nature of the operation which will be performed under the
influence of any given strength of sound waves. If the membrane is delicate so that it vibrates freely, and the "hopping
piece" is light, the latter will be thrown up into the air and
thus break the contact and interrupt the current. The contrary qualities will leave the vibrations insufficient to do
this and the unbroken but varied current of the microphone
will be produced. Indeed, an efficient production of vauiaians
as well as the prevention of breaks, requires a certain mass in
the loose electrode. Now Reis made his membrane of thin
sausage skin and gave to his free electrode a weight which

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

represents the inertia resistance of a mass of 10 grains. The
modern microphone employs a sheet iron diaphragm and a
mass usually of 15 to 100 grains. Reis, moreover, expressly
directed that the applied sounds should be "sufficiently strong."
This will be more clearly understood when the Reis instruments are described.
The actual proof afforded by the publications (besides the
unanimous express statements to that effect) is positive that
such was the operation of the instrument in fact. Some
experimenters describe the chattering noise of the "hopping"
piece caused by alternately parting from: and again striking
the other electrode at each vibration. Others mention the
continual presence of the "circuit-breaking" spark at the
place of contact,- a sure proof of interruption of current by
break of contact. The descriptions of the experiments say
that they were made with the receiver on a table, and that
several persons heard it at the same time. Now, a circuitbreaker will readily produce a musical note loud enough for
this, but the delicate changes of current which transmit speech
are absolutely and physically incapable of yielding any sbund
which would even be audble from a Reis receiver. under such
circumstances. Those experimenters who thought that they
thus occasionally heard a familiar word are necessarily the
victims of their imaginations.
Every expert of our opponents who testified about the Reis
was forced to admit, in terms, on cross-examination, that such
was the only operation described; and also to confess that it
is absolutely impossible to transmit speech by that kind of
operation. Th6 reasons for this have been already explained.
This fact is of itself fatal, for, as Reis's work was done in Germany, his mere work cannot, under our statute, defeat a
patent. -TheReis defence must rest on the publications, and the
moment it is confessed that when following them speech cannot be transmitted, conitroversy is at an end. And if the Reis
apparatus, adapted to readily operate in the way described in
the IReis publications, will not, when so operated, transmit
speech, it cannot anticipate a patent which describes a mode
of operation by which speech can be transmitted, and which is

OCTOBER TERM,

Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

diametrically different from the mode of operation stated by
Reis.
Their only ground rests on the assertion that the Reis apparatus can to-day be made to transmit speech if the method of
the Bell patent be applied to it. This possibility was never
suggested until 1880, when the Bell patent was four years old.
If this were true it would only show the perfection and the
novelty of Belrs new method or mode of operation, which,
when applied, would enable that which never had been a
speaking telephone, to at once transmit speech. But it is not
true. The Reis transmitter can, by great care and practice, be
compelled to perform the Bell operation and thereby produce
the Bell current to a feeble extent, but the Reis receiver, which
is good enough for the coarse changes of his circuit-breaker, is
too unsensitive to yield any intelligible results under the influence of such delicate und-datory currents as the Reis transmitter can be made to produce. This was the state of proof
made by Professor Henry Morton, defendants' expert ipX A flcer's case, and repeated by him as expert for the JOfolecular
and Overland companies in their cases, now before this court.
In Dolbear's case, the next after S)encer's, the defendants
produced from Germany an exact fac-simile of an original lReis
apparatus, and asserted that it would talk. Challenged to
repeat their tests in the presence of witnesses, they did so on
two successive days, the defendants themselves, by their experts,
doing the talking and listening, but with a shorthand writer
stationed at both ends. Upon comparing the results, it was
found that out of about 150.0 words uttered into the transmitter,
the listener thought he heard 26, and out of these 26, 18 had
not been spoken.
Whenever later experts undertook to say that they could
talk with the Reis instrmnent, we challenged them to repeat
their tests in the presence of witnesses, "as was done in Dolbear's case," and every one of them declined the challenge;
while Professor Morton, for the defence, had to admit on the
witness stand in the .Alolecetda, and Overland cases that after
repeated trials, extending over several years, he found himself
unable to understand anything with the Reis apparatus as a

TELEPHONE OASES.

whole. It is also a fact proved in the case by the defendants'
experts on cross-examination that the genuine Reis apparatus
at the Smithsonian, when used as a whole, cannot talk. Ilt
apparatus was purchased by Professor Henry himself in 1bY4,
shown by him to Mr. Bell in 1875, yet in his Centennial report
of 1816 lie officially declared Mr. Bell's instrument to be the
first speaking telephone ever known, - styling it "the greatest
marvel hitherto achieved- by the telegraph;" "an inventi6n
yet in its infancy."
When any witnesses have testified that they got speech with
a Reis instrument, it has been made substantially apparent in
one way or another that they did it by altering the apparatus
so as to prevent it from performing the Reis circuit-breaking
operation, and compel it to perform the Bell current-varying
operation. A slight physical change may suffice for that purpose, but any such change, or attempt at it, falsifies the instrument. The fact is that by the aid of knowledge acquired from
the Bell patent, the Reis telephone can be made to perform the
operation of that patent to some slight theoretical extent. But
even then it is so ill adapted to that operation, for which iReis
never intended it, and is so well adapted for the circuit-breaking operation for which Reis did invent it, that when the
attempt is made to compel it to perform the Bell operation it
does it so imperfectly that no intelligible speech results.
[In the course of this argument the various Reis publications
were examined in detail and illustrated by some experiments
performed in court.]
Reis nade three forms of apparatus which he publicly described. The first two (1861 and 1862) were purely experimental and it is not known that more than one of each was
constructed.i The third, made in 1863, was adopted by him
as his final form, put on sale as a pitch transmitter, and continued to be the only form used by him .until his death in
November, 1874. It is shown in the following view of the
whole apparatus (a fac-simile of the cut forming part of the
advertisement he published from 1863 until his death). The

outline diagram below shows the working parts of the transmitter.
The transmitter A consists of a hollow box about four
inches square and deep. The top or cover is pierced with a
round hole over which is stretched a membrane diaphragm
about 1j inches in diameter. To this is cemented a strip of
flexible platinum foil (H in the diagram). A piece of brass
( a, b, in the cut; 0, C' in the diagram) shaped like two sides
of a right-angled triangle, is provided at the angle and at each
extremity with a little leg made of a small pin of platinum,
so that it can stand on the three like a tripod. Two of these
legs (at a, b, in the cut; E, E' in the diagram) rest on the
frame of the instrument, while the third, placed at the angle,
rests on the spatula-shaped end of the platinum foil, H, at the
centre of the diaphragm. The instrument is so connected with

a battery 13, that when at rest the current flows to the foil at
G, through the foil II, to the platinum leg resting on it at F,
through one branch C', of the angle piece to its leg at E,
which is connected (usually by standing in a cup of mercury)
with a wire leading back to the battery. The receiver (0 of
the view) is included in this circuit. If the angle piece be
lifted from the foil the circuit is interrupted -" broken and the current stops.
Sound waves from any. source that is vigorous enough
enter the hollow box through the tube shown at the side.
They throw the diaphragm into vibration, the angular "hopping piece" is thrown into the air, like a boy tossed in a
blanket, the electrical connection between it and the foil is
broken, and the current is interrupted, to again frbw when the
hopping piece falls back into place. Thus at each vibration
the current is once interrupted. This intermittent current,
passing to the receiver, compels it to vibrate once for each interruption, that is, the same number of times per second as
the diaphragm of the fransmitter. The pitch of the resulting sound is therefore the same as the pitch of the sound
which acts on the transmitter.
Reis in his lecture of 1861, speaking of his first form (the
bored block, p. 11, sqn'a), says "each sound wave causes a
breaking and closing of the current" and therefore the receiver
"gives a tone whose pitch corresponds to the number of interruptions in a(given time." The only description of the next
form (Legat article, Jow-nal of the German-Aaut'iaib Telegraph Asoeiation, vol. 9, p. 125, 1862, on p. 33, supra) says,
"at each condensation of the air in the tube the circuit is opened
and at each rarefaction the circuit is closed." In his printed
advertisement of his perfected instrument of 1863 (the hollow
box form shown in the cut on pp. 60, 290, supra), Reis offered
it purely as an apparatus for scientific experiment in the reproduction of pitch. He says of it: "I am now able to offer
an apparatus which satisfies my expectations and with which
every physicist will succeed in repeating these interesting experiments," etc. What that instrument would readily and
habitually do in the hands of any user was therefore all that

he expected of it or had accomplished with it. Describing
the operation he says, "for every full vibration the circuit is
onbe opened and again closed and thereby are produced" in
the receiver "just the same number of vibrations-"
In a letter sent to Mr. Ladd, July 13, 1863, instructing him
how to exhibit to the British Association the telephone Ladd
had purchased of Reis a few days before, Reis writes in English (Journal Soc. Tel. Engrs., 2 arch, 1883): 1 "It. was no
hard labor, either to imagine that any other membrane beside
that of our ear could be brought to make similar oscillations,
if spanned 2 in a proper manner or to make wue of these oscilZations for the interruption of a galvanic current. However,

these were the principles which guided me in my invention;
they were sufficient to induce me to try the reproduction of
tones at any distance. It would be long to relate all the
fruitless attempts I made, until I found out the proportion
of the instrument and the necessary tension of the membrane.
The apparatus you bought is now what may be found most
simple and works without failing when arranged carefully in
the following manner.
"The apparatus consists of two separate parts, one for the
singing station A, and the other for the hearing station B."
"If a person sings at the station A, in the tube x, the vibrations of air will pass into the box and move the membrane
above, thereby the platinum foot 0 of the movable angle will
be lifted up, and will open the stream [of electricity] at every
condensation of air in the box. The stream will be reestablished at every rarefaction. In this manner the steel axis at
station B will be magnetic once for every full vibration," etc.
So, according to his own statement, "theprinciples which
guided me in my invention" were "the interruption of the
current" by throwing up the hopping piece so that it parted
contact. Observers published that they noticed the chattering,
noise made by these" blows and the "circuit-breaking-spark"
which resulted. *

Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

Reis so constructed his machine as to insure this circuitbreaking operation. 'We have already pointed out (p. 286,
sapra) that whether the circuit-breaking operation or the new
variable-pressure microphonic operation is performed depends
upon the relation between the force of the sounds applied, the
delicacy of the diaphragm and consequent freedom and violence of its vibrations produced by those sounds, and the lightness of the hopping-piece. " Now Reis employed a diaphragm
of thin sausage skin, says that the tension he gave even to
this delicate membrane, and the proportions he gave to the
parts, were essential, and expressly directs in his published
directions for use that the actuating sounds are to be "sufficiently strong." These directions, contained in papers which
state the circuit-breaking operation and none other, are statements that the structure is to be such as will insure that
operation; and when these directions are followed, that operation invariably results. The modern microphone, on the
other hand, restricts the range of vibration of the diaphragm
by making it of sheet iron, or wood, or cork, and sometimes
by dampening springs and other devices; increases the weight
of the free electrode so that, instead of a weight of 18 grains
distributed in such manner as to give an inertia resistance of
10 grains, which Reis had, an inertia resistance of 75 to 150
grains is now employed; while the voice is generally applied
at four or five inches from the diaphragm.
As the operation depends upon a due "proportion" between
the mass and the force acting upon it, some experts for the
infringers, departing from the "proportion" "determined" by'
Reis, to nmake it break "without failing," have so altered the
proportions that it will not break and will thus serve as a microphone. They have thus altered the proportions between
the forces and the resistances, in order to introduce new relations of the parts when in action, to thereby set up a new mode
of operation, and by it produce a new result. No ingenuity of
experts can state the case otherwise.

the efforts'of the men examined had all been directed, after
their minds were fully informed of Betts's invention, to endeavor to strain the description of Dobbs, so as to include in

something which should approximate to the invention of

In .JotCormic, v. Talcott, 20 How. 403, 409, this court spoke
of such depbsitions as "the opinions (the reveries they may often

Bell. The moment Mr. Bell's invention became known, it
was contrasted with the well-known Reis telephone, and all
the learned societies agreed that Mr. Bell had introduced an
entirely new mode of operation, and thereby accomplished
a new result.
Professor Henry, in 1875, with a Reis instrument actually
before him, praised Mr. Bell for his untried undulatory-current
idea as the frst clue to the transmission of speech, and in his
Centennial report declared the transmission of speech at all to
be an absolute novelty.
In 1877, Professor Barnard, President of Columbia College.
and other scientific men, declared at a public meeting that the
name of Mr. Bell would be handed down to posterity as that
of "the inventor of the telephone"; and all the experts for
the defence admit that, until they were employed by the
infringers, they believed Bell to be the first inventor of the
transmission of speech. Dolbear himself, in his published
book on the telephone, says that Bell's 11was the first speaking
telephone that was ever constructed."
In 1877, Mr. Preece, the electrician at the head of the En'glish Postal Telegraph, explained the telephone to the British
Association. He asserted, and that body agreed with him,
that the Reis machine '-as a mere musical telephone, and the

report adds, "the interest in the subject culninated on the
arrival of Professor Graham Bell, the inventor of the talking
telegraph."
On October 31, 1877, the English Society of Telegraph
Engineers, the most eminent electrical society in the world,
held a special meeting "to welcome Mr. Bell to England,"
and to hear from Mr. Bell his account of. what its president
styled "one of the most. interesting discoveries of our age."
Mr. Latimer Clark, an eminent electrician, offered the vote of
thanks to Mr. Bell, saying, "There has never been a subject
brought before us since my connection with this society, and
that is from its beginning, so interesting or so important as
the one we have heard this evening, orone which will form
a greater epoch in the history of electricity."
When the microphone was offered to the English public by
Professor Hughes, in 1878, he, in his communication read by
Professor Huxley before the Royal Society, and the other
gentlemen who described it, declared that Reis merely produced music, but thtt Bell, by the correspondence of form
which he introduced into the current, "reproduced all the
delicacies of the human voice."
The French Academy of Sciences publicly expressed the
same views, and on their recommendation Mr. Bell received
the great Volta prize.
The Government of Reis's own country, Germany, indeed
refused M1r. Bell a patent, as their patent law required, because
lie had himself published his own invention before he filed
an application. But through its patent office it has declared,
after two years' study, that the Reis was a mere circuitbreaker, and not a speaking microphone. It did this in terms
in the patent granted in Germany to Liidtge for a microphone, on an application filed January 12, 1878. It has since
sustained that patent on the ground that the speaking microphone (which the Reis was, if it was a speaking telephone at
all)-had never be6h described in Germiany before that application.

to study with peculiar care the nature of articulating sonorous
vibrations. The effort to construct for himself Helmholtz's
electrical vowel apparatus induced him to devote attention to
electricity, and he made some important inventions in a new
form of multiple harmonic or musical telegraph. In 1874, he
thought out theoretically the speaking telephone in the form
of Fig. '7 of -his patent, such as has been described. It seemed
to him, however, considering the feeble electrical forces due to
currents generated solely by the action of the voice on that
instrument, and comparing them with the forces needed to
operate the most delicate instruments theretofore known, that

have been
an empty frivolity. They themselves aver that the magneto

is a practically worthless contrivance; and although this is
not true, it
is nevertheless a fact that the microphone has supplanted it
in connercial use; and their claim is that Reis invented the microphone
long before
Mr. Bell was heard of. The construction of an inferior form of
an existing
instrument wolild not make Mr. Bell illustrious, nor lead that great

the electrical operation and consequent results at the receiving
end, though necessarily perfect in kind, would be too feeble to
be of practical utility: But the idea had taken firm possession
of his mind. In March, 1875, he saw Professor Henry at
Washington, and explained his views to him. He wrote to his
father and mother a few days afterwards, describing that interview, saying (the capitals and italics are in the original):
"I felt so much encouraged by his interest, that I determined to ask his advice about the apparatus I have designed
for the transmission of the human voice by telegraph. I explained the idea, and said, 'What would you advise me to do;
publish it and let others work it' out, or attempt to solve the
problem myself ' He said he thought it was the germ of a
great invention, and advised me to work at it myself, instead
of publishing. I said that I recognized the fact that there
were mechanical- difficulties in the way that rendered the plan
impracticable at the present time. I added that I felt that I
had not the electrical knowledge necessary to overcome the
difficulties. His laconic answer was, ' GET IT.'

is unfortunately one of

the cui bono people, and is too much in the habit of looking at
the dark side of things. Such a'-chimerical idea as telegraphing vocaZ sounds would indeed, to most minds, seem scarcely
feasible enough to spend time in working over. I believe,
however, that it is feasible, and that I have got the clue to the
solution of the problem."
It further appeared that at that very interview Professor
Henry showed him a Reis telephone, bought the year before
in Paris. He had the clue, and left Professor Henry's room
with a confirmed certainty that he was not fighting against a
law of nature, and therefore that success was only difficult,
and not impossible. Within a year from that time his patent
had issued, and presently Henry, who had approved his conception, publicly proclaimed his success. Since in so short a time
he went so far, it is impossible to criticise his methods of work
or to accuse him of want of diligence.

OCTOBER TERAL 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

In performing, on June 2, 1875, an experiment with a new
form of multiple musical telegraph which employed two reeds
or springs vibrated in front of an electro-magnet, like Fig. 5
and Fig. 6 of his patent, one of the springs was accident1ly
knocked, and thus set in vibration.' He found that this slight
vibration produced a sound from the spring of another instrunent connected in electrical circuit. With another man the
trivial accident might have passed unnoticed. But he instantly
joined it with- his older thoughts. The marriage was fruitful
and the speaking telephone was born.. It thenceforth needed
oInly nurture. It at once struck hhn that if he was right in his
observation of this accident, then the feeble vibrations of a
spring in front of an electro-nmagnet had developed sufficient
electric currents to produce audible sonorous effects at a distance. He repeated the experiment for an hour or two, and
sanguinely satisfied that his former fears about the feebleness
of the currents were ill founded, he instantly gave orders for
the construction of a speaking telephone with a membrane
diaphragm, such as he had conceived and described eight
months before to his friend Professor C. J. Blake, of Boston,
and to others, two of whom have testified to his description.
The instruments were ill-made, and broke to pieces at the first
trial. He repaired them and tried them again. 2 His success
was indifferent. It is not certain whether a single word was
intelligibly understood. Nevertheless, his study of the subject
and his experiment proved absolutely that the most he had to
contend with was a question of workmanship or technical mechanical skill and nicety in the construction of precisely such
a form of apparatus as he had made; and it has so turned out.
He was in great trouble financially, and in some other
ways. He pawned his watch and borrowed of his friends,
and for a time was heart-broken for other reasons. He was
in no condition to go into elaborate experimenting, but he
crystallized his ideas into a letter which he wrote August 14,
1875 (presently to be quoted), and in which he stated his purThe instrument is shown on p. 305, infra.
" The instruments are shown on p. 321, infra.

pose as the ti'ansmission of speech, and also the transmission

of many telegraphic messages simultaneously over a single
wire, described his "method" of electrical undulaticns similar
to sound waves, and all the results that would flow from their
employment, and debated with his correspondent whether he
should file a caveat or take a patent. Afore mature reflection
determined him to the latter course. He drew the specification and claims, every word of which, as they stand in the
pgtent, are his work, and the patent issued.
I will assume that the pair of instruments he had made
never yielded an intelligible word, but still the question of the
validity of the patent does not depend upon previous experiments, but upon the sufficiency of the description. If the
instruments of the patent will talk, will transmit vocal and
other sounds so that the listener can know them apart, know
each for what it is, doing all this ia t&vmode pointed out, the
patent is good; if they will not, then it is not good. Mfr. Bell
was so thoroughly convinced that he was right, that he determined to run the risk, and did. If lie had died the moment
after he wrote the specification (lie wrote it all himself), without ever trying the experiment again, and that specification
had gone to the world as a publication, the world would have
had a speaking telephone. It would have had a rule by which
to make all speaking telephones. Yo one after such a publication could ever have taken a patent. as first inventor of the
speaking telephone.

the Reis telephone, and compared them, and performed some

so called; but a current may be at this moment of one

strength, and the next moment of a different strength; and
if those successive strengths at successive instants bear to each
other the relation which is expressed by a curve known as an
undulatory curve, then for convenience the current is spoken
of as an "undulatory" current. That does not mean that
the current has waves on it like the waves of the sea; it
means that at one instant it has one strength, and at a succeeding instant another strength, and that the relation of its
strength at one instant and its strength at another, is expressed by a curve of an "undulatory" character, as indicated
by the diagram on p. 301, infra. This phrase is borrowed
from the language of acoustics. Physical vibrations which
take place in the air, or in any mechanical medium transmitting sound, have many differences, but they all have in common one peculiarity which comes from the nature of the
physical medium in which they take place. Every medium
which transmits sonorous vibratory physical motions possesses
both elasticity and inertia, and the peculiarities which the elasticity and inertness of a medium impress upon vibrations which
take place within it consist in a certain gradualness, as distinguished from abruptness, of change. Although many of
these changes, when exhibited by curves, sometimes seem extremely abrupt and sharp, yet, from their essential nature
they are known as gradual, undulatory, or wave-like; or more
specifically, to use a still more technical term, "sinusoidal the mathematical name of the curve which, either simple or
in various combinations, expresses the free vibratory movements of elastic and inert bodies, and therefore all sonorous
vibrations. An air vibration may be simple, such as is produced by a tuning fork; it may be extremely complex, such
as is produced by the human voice or the violin. But whether
simple or complex, the nature of the medium in which it takes
place makes the mathematical statement of the character of
the vibration necessarily capable of representation either by a
simple sinusoidal curve, or by a line which though curiously
curved, and apparently ragged, is nevertheless made up of
certain combinations of simple sinusoidal curves.
All changes, whether in vibrations of the air, or fluctuations

in the height of the barometer or thermometer, or of the
tides, at successive hours, or in the strength of an electric current at successive instants, are often represented to the eye by
such curves, which are used as a graphic shorthand representation of ideas and relations which would otherwise be expressed
by pages of words. In Mr. Bell's patent they are so represented. The intermittent current is conventionally represented
by a series of blocks, as A B in the upper line of this cut:

This does not mean that there are on the line at a:,y one
instant a succession of spurts of electricity - electricity at
some parts of the line and not at others. It means that for a
period of time represented by the length of one block, there
is, all over the line, a current whose strength is represented
by the height of -the block; and that after that, for a period
of time represented by the blank space, there is no current at
all anywhere. That phenomenon is called an intermittent
current.
If, now, the current varies, so that at one instant it is of a
strength represented by the height of the line E, in the lower
diagram 0 D, and at the next instant by a strength represented
by the length of the perpendicular line F, and so on, and the
variations of strength, or the curve which represents those
variations by joining the tops of those lines, are "undulatory"
in their character, then we speak of that current as undulatory, because of that variation in its strength at successive
instants. Those are the symbols that are used in the patent.
Any succession of strengths of current can obviously be
represented by drawing perpendicular lines of relative lengths,
E, F, G, etc., representing the relative strengths at successive

instants.. Joining the upper ends of those perpendiculars,
when they are taken very close, as betw;een K L, givws a
curved line whose contour represents, to the trained eye, the
succession of lengths or strengths. From this graphic mode
of expressing the facts arises the phrase "form" of current
variations, or in abbreviation, "form of current." signifying
the current whose changes are represented by a curve of a
particular form.
An amendment to the application originally filed in the
Patent Office was made by the usual correspondence; but it
was merely explanatory and surplusage. It is entirely immaterial. That I may be free from criticism on that point, I
shall read only those parts of the specification which stand in
the patent itself exactly as they stood in the application originally filed; and my case may stand on that.
Mr. Bell, for some years before he took this patent, had
been at work on a multiple telegraph which operated by the
production of sounds of certain musical pitches, produced by
circuit-breaking and by intermittent currents. They were like
the circuit-breaking and intermittent currents of Reis, and they
produced musical pitch just as the iReis did, although Mr. Bell
worked his machine by mechanism, and not by the voice. His
present patent, the contents of which are a picture of several
years of his work and of the growth of the ideas in his mind
during that time, begins by referring to his former circuitbreaking multiple t6legraph, and states that he proposes to
discard the instruments previously used in it in favor of a
new kind. He says that he finds some advantages in the use
of a current which is not chopped up into chunks, but varies
its strength in accordance with the law of sound waves,that is, a current which is not "intermittent." but is "undulatory," - and he proceeds to state some advantages from the
one kind of current rather than the other.
It is true that every sonorous movement of the air is "undulatory"; but it is net every sonorous movement of the air
which gives rise to speech. That comes only when the undulations are of the peculiar kind or "form" belonging to the
spoken word. Speech is not the necessary result even of

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

aerial undulations, and it would have been untrue to say that
speech would be one of the results of an undulatory current.
Therefore Mr. IBell, in speaking in general terms of the advantages which flow from the use of a current, undulatory as cistinguished from intermittent, in its character, but irrespective
of the form, of the undulations, named certain advantages and
did not include speech among them, because the statement
would have been untrue if he had included it. His multiple
harmonic musical telegraph, Fig. 5 of this very patent, is
worked by currents which are "undulatory," but which are
not of the "form" requisite for speech, and which therefore
do not yield speech. This same statement which I am making
is found in substance in the letter written by Mr. Bell to Mr.
Hubbard, August 14, 1875, six months before he filed his application. He says that the advantage of the undulatory
current is that by its employment, whatever sonorous effects
can be produced in the air can be produced by electricity.
Musical sounds can be transmitted; many musical sounds at
the same time can be transmitted; and by giving the undulations the Proper form, speech, and indeed the utterances of
several speakers at the same time, can be transmitted. He
wrote in that letter (the italicsare in the original):
"I can see clearly that the magneto electric current will not
only permit of the actual copying of spokenuutterances, but of
the simultaneous transmission of any number of musical notes
(hence messages) without confusion.
"When we can create a liulsatory action of the current, which
is the exact equivalent of the aerial impulses, we shall certainly
obtain exactly similar results. Any number of sounds can
travel through the air without confusion, and any number
should pass along the same wire.
"It should even be possible for a number of spoken messages to traverse the same circuit simultaneously, for an attentive ear can distinguish one voice from another, although a
number are speaking together."
If two tuning-forks of different pitches are sounding separately, we are affected by the sensation of sound, but what we
perceive is not one sound, the mean of the two pitches; we hear

OCTOBER TERINI, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

each sound separately. The vibrations made by one fork, and
the vibrations made by the other, different as they are, travel
through the same air. In a mechanical sense, they coalesce
and combine into one complex vibration, yet the ear unconsciously analyzes them out again as separate sounds. This
which can be done in the air, M2r. Bell says, can be done by
his undulatory current in electricity; and that is true. But he
can do more than just that. As the voice in uttering a word
produces a peculiar "form" of undulation, which gives rise to
the sensation of that word a. one sound, -- no matter though it
be in itself capable of scientific analysis into a principal and
subordinate set of vibrations, expressed technically by the
phrases "fundamental" tone and "overtones," combined and
blended together, -so
an undulatory current whose undulations are due to the voice,,and are copies of its aerial impulses,
can convey the complex undulations of a particular spoken
word and yield the same result at the distant end. The conception which possessed Mr. Bell at that time was of electrical
variations of current which were to be just like the sound
waves, and which therefore could serve all of the same purposes.
They were to transmit many messages by many
pitches; spoken utterances; many spoken utterances, simultaneously; according to their combinations and forms. lie was
possessed with the idea of moulding or forming the current so
that it should be like sound vibrations generally, and also in
a given case like any particular sound vibrations that he wished
to reproduce by it. That is the substance of his patent.
That is the cardinal key and idea of his whole patent. It
was an idea wholly novel in science and the arts.
lie illustrates his plan first by describing what takes place
when the old '"intermittent" current is us6d. Then he refers
to what takes place when any sim2le undulatory current is
used, and says that he cannot describe it better than by showing its likeness to sonorous vibrations in the air. Then he
points out what happens when two independently created sets
of simple electrical undulations are thrown upon the line wire
at the same time, and points out that their effect in the total
electrical current, and in the resulting sounds, is just like the

TELEPHONE CASES.

effect produced by tuning-forks sounding simultaneously. The
patent expresses this as follows:
"The combined effect of A and B. when induced simultane-ously on the same circuit, is expressed by the curve A + B,
Fig. 4, which is the algebraical sum of the sinusoidal curves
A and B. This curve A + B3 also indicates the actual motion
of the air when the two musical notes considered are sounded
simultaneously. Thus, when electrical undulations of different
rates are simultaneously induced in the same circuit, an effect
is produced exactly analogous to that occasioned in the air by
the vibration of the inducing 1;dies. Hence, the coixistence
upon a telegraphic circuit of electrical vibrations of different
pitch is manifested, not by the obliteration of the vibratory
character of the current, but by peculiarities in the shapes of
the electrical undulations, or, in other words, by peculiarities
in the shapes of the curves which represent those undulations."
These are his leading ideas. Now he proceeds to apply
them. Ile says in the patent:
"In illustration of the method of creating electrical undulations, I shall show and describe one form of apparatus for
producing the effect."
He then describes his harmonic telegraph, Fig. 5, consisting
of the instruments here shown. The diagram is from the
patent and shows the connection of the two in circuit. The
perspective view is from one of the actual harmonic instruments he was using when he made the discovery of June 2,
1875.

When the armature c, which is a steel spring, vibrates, it
produces in the air a simple undulation of a definite rate, and
by the generation of magneto electric currents, as exTlained
on pp. 265-9, supra, it produces on the wire a simple electrical
undulation of the same rate; that, passing through the wire e

to the receiving instrument, and operating on its electromagnet, there causes its attuned reed A (the two instruments
are just alike) to perform the same simple vibratory move-'
ment, and the same simple sound is heard. The patent describes how several sets of these can be connected with the
same wire-(as in Fig. 6 of the patent, p. 5, supra), and several
notes produced at the same time from several different attuned reeds of several receivers, just as in the case of two
tuning-forks in the air. It then shows that if you break up
each set of notes into longs and shorts, you can telegraph
the Morse alphabet by each set, and thus send two or more
Morse messages at the same time over the single wire. The
patent concludes the description just stated by saying :
"The duration of the sound may be used to indicate the dot
or dash of the Morse alphabet, and thus a telegraphic despatch
may be indicated by alternately interrupting and renewing the
sound.
"Hence, by these instruments two or more telegraphic signals
or messages may be sent simultaneously over the same circuit
without interfering with one another."
The patent has now described the multiple telegraph, and it
makes no further reference to that in the rest of the specification. It next advances one step further. It states that these
electrical undulations, generically like sound waves, and available for pure musical tones when they are of the simplest form,
can be used for other special results, and for special sounds,
when they copy ipecial sound waves:
"I desire here to remark that there are many other uses to
which these instruments may be put, such as the simultaneous
transmission of musical notes, difering in loudness, as well as
in pitch, and the telegraphic transmissiono noises or sounds
of any kind."

He then proceeds to describe Fig. -7(cut on p. 309, ind),
a different instrument from Fig. 5, and intended for this latter
and different purpose. Some of the experts for the defence
have said that they find first in this patent a multiple telegraph, Fig. 5, which is true. Then they say that because Fig.
5 is a multiple telegraph, they have a right to assume that

TELEPHONE CASES.

Fig. 7 is also. But the language of the patent itself is explicit.
HIavinogdescribed the multiple telegraph, Fig. 5, it passes from
that subject entirely, and then, going to Fig. 7, it says that that
is intended for - other " uses, to wit, not merely the transmission and reproduction of pitch; not merely the reproduction
of differences of loudness, as well as of pitch; that is, not
merely the reproduction of musical tones, differing both in
loudness and pitch, but "the telegraphic transmission of noises
and sounds of any kind." This languare is expressly used to
distinguish the transmission of the characteristic called pitch,
and the transmission of the characteristic called loudness, from
the third thing which goes beyond all that, -the transmission of
"noises or sounds of any kind;" which means their transmission in such a way that they can be distinguished from each
n'n(l of sound from
other bv that which distinguishes one
another kind, and which, moreover, is something in addition to
mere pitch or mere loudness. That is, lie expressly contrasts
the transmission of noises and sounds of all kinds, with the
transmission of musical notes, and mentions it as something
going beyond the transmission of musical notes.
This is again made clear by his description of the apparatus,
for that shows new features introduced into Fig. 7 to fit it for
new functions, leading to a new kind of result. First he
describes the tuned-reed instrument, Fig. 5, to be vibrated
meclmnically; that necessarily causes its own pitch to be
reproduced. That is the transmission of pitch simply. Then
lie -says that that instrument, used differently, will also transmit loudness. In the particular case where you control the
violence of the vibration of the transmitter reed, you will
control the loudness of the sound at the further end. The
patent states this as follows:
"When the armature c Fig. 5, is set in vibration, the armature 71responds not only in pitch, but in loudness ...
"When c vibrates forcibly, the amplitude of the vibration of
7 is considerably increased, and the resulting sound becomes
louder. So, if A and B, Fig. 6, are sounded simultaneously
2
kA loudly and D softly), the instruments A' and A repeat
2
loudly the signals of A, and D' B repeat softly those of B."

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

He has thus described how to produce a sound of the desired
pitch. Next he has described how to control loudness. Finally
we come to the third purpose stated, to wit, the transmission
of "noises and sounds of any kind." Fig. 5 cannot do that, or
at least not normally or effectively. The vibrating parts are
tuned reeds, or tuning-forks, and the very essence of such an
instrument is that it can be relied upon always to vibrate in
its own way, and will not vibrate in any other. It therefore
.cannot copy "any" kind of vibrations, which must be done in
order to produce "any" kind of sound. To accomplish that,
the strong will of the instrument must be overcome, and it
must be made subservient to the will of the operator, or rather
to whatever may be at the moment the movement of the air
partices set in vibration by his voice or by any other, kind of
;sound to be transmitted. To accomplish this, Mr. Bell says
that instead of having a spring arinature (c)
which can vibrate
-only in one way, he will out the spring (he describes it as a
,clock spring which is a thin and light piece of metal), and put
.a hinge in its place and attach the whole to the diaphragm of
a lover's telephone, which we know can vibrate in any way, in
response to any kind of sound. He will then have got the
mechanical conditions essential for the reproduction of "any
kind" of sound. The patent then explains that when the
transmitter of an apparatus of this sort is thrown into vibration by the sound waves - sound waves produced by the utterances of the human voice are the particular kind mentionedit will produce electrical undulations on the line; and the
electrical changes produced will not only be "undulatory," but
they will be of the peuliar kind of undulations belonging to

the sound uttered. Or, to state it in the then known language
of acoustics, they will be "similar in form" to the air vibrations
caused by the sound. These electrical undulations go over the
line, and when they ieach the receiver they, by reason of their
peculiarity of form, influence the armature of the receiver to
.copy the motion of the transmitter in the manner stated on pp.
267-270, supra; and the result, he says, is that a similar sound
.to that uttered into the transmitter is then heard to proceed
-from the receiver. The paragraph is:

TELEPHONE CASES.
3r. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

"The armature c, Fig. 7,is fastened loosely by one extremity to the uncovered leg d of the electro-magnet b, and its other
extremity is attached to the centre of the stretched membrane
u. A cone A is used to converge sound vibrations upon the
membrane. When a sound is uttered into the cone, the membrane a is set in vibration, the armature c is forced to partake
of the motion, and thus electrical undulations are created upon
the circuit B b efg. These undidationsare sirnilar inform to
the air vibrations caused by the sound; that is, they are represented graphically by similar curves. The undulatory current
passing through the electro-magnet f influences its armature
h to copy the motion of the armature c. A similar sound to
that uttered into A is then heard to proceed from L."
This apparatus produces this result by the employment of
electrical changes which are undulatory in their character;
but it produces it, not simply because they are undulatory in
their character, but because they are of the precise "form"
of undulation which belongs to the sounds uttered into the
transmitter. That "similarity of form" is essential to .the
result, and as it is the most striking novelty, he thus summed
up the whole invention in his claim:
"5. The method of and apparatus for transmitting vocal or
other sounds telegraphically as herein described, by causing
electrical undulations similar in form to the virations of the
ah- accompanying the said vocal or other sounds, substantially
as set forth."
"We cannot find that in any publication before Mr. Bell's
time," say even all the defendants' experts. "So marvelously
simple that the only wonder is that it was not known before,"
says Professor Barker. "I cannot transmit speech without
that," says Professor Dolbear and his experts. That is the

OCTOBER TERMI,

Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

novelty. It is not only a novelty which distinguishes Mr.
Bell's apparatus from what preceded him, but it is the novelty
which makes it to be a speaking telephone. It is the very gist
and soul of this invention.
The defendants' expert Professor George Barker, who witnessed Bell's exhibition at the Centennial. testified on crossexamination:
"I was greatly astonished and delighted to hear for the first
time the transmission of articulate speech electrically.
"I cannot speak of the others present. Perhaps very naturally their interest in the remarkable result that they had just
witnessed led them to question Mr. Bell in regard to the theory
of the telephone. As for myself, the mode of operation of
the instrument was obvious at once as soon as it was exhibited ; it was one of those marvellously simple inventions that
causes one to wonder, on seeing it for the first time, that it
had not been invented long before."
And yet the defendants want this court to believe that the
result was old, instruments for producing it were well known,
and that the operation stated is so purely imaginative that it
is not statable and ought not to be accepted or believed.
The experts undertake to say that they would like to have
the court believe that this patent is only for a telegraph, because the claim itself says "transmit vocal sounds telegraphically" which ex vi ternini, they say, means by a Morse telegraph. Even their verbal criticism is absurd. The record
contains many cases of the use of the phrases "telegraphic
transmission of sounds" - and "vocal sounds," as applied to
the speaking telephone by men of authority as writers. It
appears from Mr. Bell's own letters before the patent, that
"the transmission of vocal sounds" was the phrase which he
generally used to express the transmission of speech. Sir
William Thomson's formal report on Bell's speaking telephone at the Centennial, and Professor Henry's official report,
both spoke of it as a form of "telegraph." They say that
the transmission of speech by it was "the greatest marvel
achieved by the electric telegraph." President Barnard, of
Cohimbia College, one of the Centennial judges, wrote of it

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

as "your plan of telegraphing vocal sounds." .The old string
instrument does nothing but transmit speech, and yet it is
called the "lover's teleg'aph." The patent is in terms for the
transmission of "noises or sounds of any kind," and the particular kind which is mentioned in illustration are the utterances of the human voice. The operation described will
transmit noises or sounds of any kind, including speech (not
speech exclusively) because, by natural laws, the apparatus,
if sufficient for "any kind" of sound - the language of the
patent -will transmit all; and a statement that it transmits "speech"- would be less comprehensive and less true.
Every court has so decided.
Yet some of the experts have labored to make the court
believe that under that language he meant to include not
"other" uses than the multiple telegraph, nor utterances of
the human voice as everybody understands them, but a contrivance for multiple telegraphy alone, excluding those utterances
of the hmnan voice which distinguish articulate speaking man
from the gibbering brute. But even the Gray caveat, which
is set up as a model, uses the same language - "transmitting
vocal sounds." It adds the clause, "It is obvious by this
means that oral conversation can be transmitted." It is
obvious, and no man could become the inventor of the art of
transmitting speech, or ever even an improver in that art, by
reprinting Mr. Bell's specification and adding this "obvious"
conclusion in terms.
One of the defendants' experts (Dr. Channing), having first
said that he could not find better language than the fifth
claim of the Bell patent to express the operation -by which
the telephone - transmits speech, afterwards criticised it, but
finally had to say again, after eight years' study of the
telephone, "No better form of expression occure to me at this
moment as a general statement."
The fifth claim is the only one sued on, but the third and
fourth hel l) to show its meaning and scope. Claim 3 is for
producing the undulations by the magneto mode; claim 4 is
for producing them by the variable-resistance mode. But
claim 5 is not a claim for producing them by any particular

mode. It is, as the Molecular brief well says, "for transmitting speech by means of them" .when they are of the particular form specified. Claims 3 and 4 are for producing them
in -the machine, as means to be there used; but claim 5 is for
transmitting speech by this means. They are the means, the
novel means, and the effective means.
-To this claim our opponents object that it specifies a,
mere conception - a law of nature - a mere idea. But that
idea was the idea which-gave birth to the speaking telephone.
There were no speaking telephones before, because the world
did not have that idea. Every speaking telephone since then
has been the embodiment of that idea.
Watt's invention of the steam engine, or rather Watt's
imprOvement in the steam engine, consisted simply in telling
the public that instead of squirting cold water into the cylinder to condense the steam, they should let the steam escape
into a separate box and squirt the water into that. "Because," said he, "squirting cold water into the steam cylinder
cools it down, and when you next let the steam in you use a
great deal of steam in simply heating the cylinder up again.
So, have one hot chamber for a working chamber, and keep
that hot, and let the steam escape into a cold clamber when
you want to condense it, and keep that chamber cold." His
patent had no drawings, and so far as this invention was concerned gave only the rudest description of an apparatus, which
was found so imperfect in practice that it was of very little
use. But, with the idea once stated, a good engineer could
make a working machine. The infringers answered to his
patent, "This is perfectly obvious; you have only stated an
idea -a mere law of nature." But the judges said, in substance, "This man has created the steam engine that everybody wants, &nd the statement that he has made was all that
was needed to enable people to make this engine. He has
not only made his own very wretched form of engine,"indeed, he never made a working engine before he took his
patent, -

"

but he has given the rule for future steam engines.

If such an improvement cannot be encouraged by the protection of the Patent Law, then there is no Patent Law." And

so every form of engine which embodied that idea was held
to infringe.
Fifty years ago appeared another great invention -the
Neilson hot blast. To smelt a ton of ore in a blast furnace
requires about two tons of air to be blown in. It requires
more fuel to heat that air than to heat the ore; and blowing
in that vast amount of cold air cools the furnace and leads to
very great difficulties. Neilson said, "Why don't you blow
the air in hot?"

That was the invention -that

was the

whole of it. Of course he had got to do a little more; he
had got to tell them how to heat the air. "Why," said he,
"build a fire around the pipe between the blowing engine and
the furnace. Indeed,.enlarge the pipe over that-fire into a
large receptacle, in proportion to the amount of air you want
to get through; then the air will stay there longer and get
hotter." That was the whole patent. No man who knew
that the vapor from a still is 6ondensed by pouring cold water
on the pipe, or had seen the surface condenser of Watt's engine,
would pretend that Neilson's contrivance as a mere machine
for changing the temperature of the inclosed gas had invention enough to sustain a patent. Blowing a hot blast into
a smelting furnace was his real invention. "A law of nature," everybody said. All the old women in England heat
their teapots, so as not to cool the water when they pour it
in to steep the tea. "As for your machine," said the iron
makers, "a large receptacle to pass the air through is practically worthless. We shall build T fire around the pipe itself
without any receptacle, letting the pipe take a good many
turns backward and forward in the fireplace like the worm
of an old still." "But," the court said, "you avail yourself
of that idea which Neilson first introduced into the arts. His
form was operative enough to sustain his patent, and you adopt
yours not because it does not heat the blast, but because it
heats it hotter." Their form was a great deal better than his.
That is always the case with great originators. The next man
who comes along and uses the brains of the first as a stepping
stone will go far beyond him. The first Watt steam engine,
the first Neilson hot blast contrivance, the first Morse tele-

graph, the first Howe sewing-machine, the first Bessemer
plant, were not worth having in a commercial sense; indeed,
all the users of the fist Bessemer plant threw it away, because
they could not make i work successfully. But the great inventor opened the door. All that the others had to do was
to enter the new house and make it more comfortable.
Infringement.- It has been apparent that if the Bell patent
be limited to the particular form of Fig. 7, and to the use of
its method only wihe? practisedwith a magneto tramnsmitter, no
defendant infringes the first patent for all use microphone
transmitters. But if it has the scope we have asserted for it,
the defendants'cannot successfully deny infringement.
To this Dolbear's form of apparatus is no exception. He
uses a microphone transmitter and a "condenser" receiver. He
and his experts agree that his transmitter produces the undulations of the patent, and that it cannot transmit speech unless
it does. They say in terms that so far as the tbansmitter goes
their apparatus is, Bell's Fig. 7. But they insist that the difference iu the receiver, and the changes of arrangement incident
to that difference, relieve them.
Electricity has two long-known properties. When it flows
around a piece of iron it makes that piece attract a plate in
proportion to the amount flowing at each instant. When it
flows into a piece of iron, it makes that piece attract a plate in
proportion to the amount which has flowed into the plate and
is in it at each instant. Bell used the first property to attract
his plate; Dolbear used the second. But the novelty which
makes the plate of the Bell receiver and the Dolbear receiver
talk is not merely that the electricity produces an attraction
propprtioned to its amount, but that the amount of electricity
sent from the transmitter to act on whatever receiver be placed
at -the distant end, varies in accordance with the rule laid down
by Mr. Bell as constituting his method. The Dolbear talks
because it follows this rule.
Indeed, if a Bell receiver be connected with the Dolbear line,
the same electrical undulations- sent from the Do1bear microphone transmitter will make the Bell receiver talk by one of
its iroperties, and the Dolbear receiver talk by the other of

TELEPHONE CASES.

its properties. Both employ the electrical undulations of the
patent. In one their special and novel characteristics manifest
themselves to the ear by one well-known property, and in the
other by another well-known property. Dolbear's defence
reduces itself to the same kind of attempt to narrow the
patent which the other defendants make.
B'eako and Dead-Poins.- Some of the defendants' experts, particularly Messrs. Young and. Brackett, of Princeton,
and Professor Sylvanus P. Thompson, of Bristol, England,
(whose deposition was taken in this case,) used language which
was intended to induce the court to believe that the microphone transmitter used bi, the defendants produced interruptions in the current; they insisted that the fifth claim of the
Bell patent was technically limited to currents that were
strictly continuous; and upon this they founded the argument
that by reason of the alleged breaks in the current these
microphones were taken outside of the Bell patent, and that
the use of these instruments did not infringe..
To this there are several answers. One is, that the experiments and reasoning detailed in the testimony of Professor
Cross and Professor Wright, experts for the Bell Company,
prove that speech cannot be satisfactorily, or even intelligibly,
transmitted by any instrument actuated by the voice, which
causes breaks in a battery circuit (and a microphone is always
necessarily placed in a battery circuit) as often as even once in
each complete vibration. Another answer is, that if the averments of defendants' experts as to breaks 'were true, their
current would still be substantially ]\fr. Bell's current, because
it would possess, as the essential characteristic which enables it
to transmit speech, that characteristic which MUr. Bell introduced into the current and described and claimed in his patent.
There is nothing in the phraseology of the Bell patent
which limits it to strictly continuous currents. The word "continuous" does not occur in the patent. Continuous currents
were old in telegraphy, and the patent itself points out and
discards one kind of continuous current which it calls a "pulsatory" current, and which will not transmit speech. The
patent makes the test of the described current to be its

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.

Mr.

Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co

conformity to sonorous vibrations in the air. Any phenomena

which axe common to that current and to sonorous vibrations,
and to which the term "break" may be applied, would therefore, if found in the defendants' current, be an element of
similarity, and not of dissimilarity. Furthermore,,ny breaks
which occur, if they are not sufficient to destroy speech,- as
when they occur between words, or at the dividing line
between one vibration and another, - if they can occur then
without the destruction of speech, -would be negligible, and
would not prevent the current in which they occurred from
being substantially 11r. Bell's current. An outline of a pure
curve may be substantially made, both in fact and in the
patent law, by a dotted line, or by a broken line made as by
the cross-stitch of worsted-work, or like the contour of a polygon of a great number of sides. Winans v. Denmead, 15.
jHow. 330, 344; roes v. Hamilton, 92 U. S. 430, 432.
Again, the distinction between the current of Mr. Bell and
the current of iReis is, that Bell impressed upon his current
those peculiarities of vibration which constitute "form" and
give rise to "quality." It is absolutely certain that the current, which is the sole connecting link between the transmitter
and the receiver, cannot convey these peculiarities from the
transmitter to the receiver unless they are impressed upon it;
they must be delivered to the messenger which is to carry
them, or they will not be carried. Mr. Bell's invention and
patent cover the use of a current upon which those peculiarities have been impressed, no matter what type of instrument
be used as the transmitter to impress them. If it were true,
as we believe it is not, that the microphone impresses them
upon the current with substantial efficiency by means of a
series of modified and modulated breaks (entirely different
from the single, simple break of Reis) the current would be
none the less substantially Bell's current, and infringe his
patent.
Finally, it is clear that the statements of the defendants'
experts on this subject turn chiefly on the ambiguous use of
language. Thus, Professor Thompson, on cross-examination,
admits that he means by "breaks" partial breaks over only

TELEPHONE CASES
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

part of the surfaces in contact; breaks which, while they
weaken the current, do not entirely stop it; and Professors
Young and Brackett adopt that statement as probably a correct explanation of the operation of the microphone. Dr.
Cresson, in the Clay case, points out that in the to-and-fro
motion of the air particle, as in every vibratory motion, there
must be an instant of rest.or no motion, or, as it is more properly called, a "dead point," when the particle, having moved
in one direction, turns to move back in the other. The diaphragn of the telephone, he says, has these same inistants of
rest, and thus produces instants of no current in the line which
connects with the receiver in the simple magneto apparatus, or
in the microphone which uses an induction coil. But he was
forced to confess that this phenomenon, by whatever name it
may be called, occurs at each extremity of each complete vibration of the air particle, and at every subordinate change or
reversal of the motion, and that its occurrence, therefore, in
the current is an instance of resemblance and not of divergence.
Th7e second Bell jpatent, -Yo. 186,787, of Janualry30, 1877.The patent of March 7, 1876, was for a "method" and for the
first instrument which embodied it. This second patent is for-improvements of detail in the structure of that magneto' instrument.
The first patent showed the multiple telegraph instruments
Figs. 5 and 6. This apparatus required for each set (1) two
instruments specially adapted for a particular musical pitch;
(2) that each pair, though at distant stations, should be always
kept tuned in unison. (3) According to it, Fig. '(, an entirely
different instrument, was required for speech. The second
patent showed Fig. 7 so improved that (1) it would transmit
speech better than before; (2) the same instrument that served
for speech would also, and without tuning, serve for the mul'tiple telegraph and for all pitches; (3) the battery of the first
patent could be dispensed with.
The leading features introduced by this second patent are:
(1) The use of an iron diaphragm in both transmitter and
receiver, instead of a. diaphragm of membrane with attached
.armature;

I OCTOBER TERMI, 1887.

(2) The employment in the telephone of a different form
of magnet combined with the other parts, giving much better
results;
(3) New shapes of air spaces and casings which ward off
extraneous and disturbing vibrations, and preserve the desired
sound waves from distortion or weakening;
(1) The employmeat of a permanent magnet instead of a
battery to magnetize the cores of the electro-magnets.

Elisha Gray did upon two or three occasions, before 1876,
experimentally, combine a sheet of iron and a magnet. It is
clear that -Gray used his sheet of iron-it was the bottom of
a tin wash-basin or a tin cup - as an acoustic ieflector or resonator to increase the well-known sound produced by the
magnet itself (the so-called "Page effect "), and never thought
of claiming for his contrivance any magnetic co-operation until
long after he saw Bell telephones in commercial use. But
apart from that, their work ranks as abandoned experiments.
They did not use the contrivance in a speaking telephone, and
did not make any attempt in that direction. On the contrary,
when speaking telephones became known, both of them announced the opinion (Gray in his caveat) that for the feeble
forces available in the telephone a delicate membrane like
goldbeater's skin must be employed. Their contrivances were
purely experimental in the strictest sense, used two or three
times for entertainment merely, with circuit-breaking tuningfork transmitters, to produce loud musical sounds by a powerful intermittent current, never supposed by either maker to be
of any use, mentally and physically thrown away, abandoned
and lost, or some of the parts only preserved by accident.
Professor Pickering placed a magnet, temporarily, in front
of a tin box, and has never made any claim to the invention.
Mr. Gray claimed it only when the Western Union Company acquired his pretensions in the fall of 1877 and set
him up as a "prior inventor." He did not describe that receiver in his caveat and had forgotten it until he joined the
infringers in the fall of 1877. It remained for Mr. Bell to
discover and to utilize the marvellous sensitiveness of a disk
of sheet iron supported at its edges.

net per se was old. But -it had never been used to produce
sound; it was net used or considered useful for any such
operation as it performs in the telephone; and the reasons
which make it a desirable form to combine with a diaphragm
in a telephone are far outside of the ordinary knowledge of an
electrical workman. Claim 5 is not for this magnet. It is
for making a new form of speaking telephone which has
this magnet as one member.

Bell's EnglishPatent.-The inventions of this second patent
were patented in England. The English patent was applied
for December 9, 1876. The United States patent was applied
for January 15, 1877, and was actually issued January 30,
1877. The English application was not completed by the
filing of the full specification, -the question of granting the
patent was not passed upon by the law officers, and the patent
itself was neither written, signed nor sealed, until after May
1, 1877. The invention therefore was not "patented" in
England at the time the United States patent was granted.
Mvr. Bell could not, in January 1877, state the English patent,
which did not exist until some months afterwards.
It is immaterial whether the English patent was then
granted or not, because, it has not yet expired, and upon
either view the American patent is still in force.

Mr. Bell exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, in June, 1876, the following speaking telephones.
Two memrnrane diaphragm magneto instruments, capable
of use either as transmitters or receivers, but in fact used as
transmitters at the public test on June 25, 1876. The base
is of black walnut, the frames are of brass castings, and the
cones are of japanned tin. They differ only in that one has
a single bar electro-magnet and the other a horse-shoe or
double pole electro-magnet. The section is drawn to scale,
one-fourth size. The membranes are three inches in diameter.

The receiver used at the Centennial consisted of an iron tube

as the diaphragm. Inside the -tube was a soft-iron core 0,
around which was the coij H. A battery of several cells was
placed in circuit. The core C was in contact with the iron
bottom of the iron tube E, which thus itself became magnetic.

The first infringement was that of the Western Union, in
18'78, and formed the subject of the Dowd suit. The next was
that of the Eaton Company (Spencer case) in the summer of
1880. It was in that suit that it was first alleged that Reis
invented the speaking telephone. At that time there were
140,000 speaking telephones in use under license from the Bell
Company.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Ker's Argument for Clay Commercial Telephone.

Mr. William W. Her for the Clay Commercial Telephone.
It is alleged in the bill of complaint that the American Bell
Telephone is "a corporation duly established under the laws
of tho Commonwealth of Massachusetts." This is a descriptive allegation. If a descriptive allegation is not proved as
laid, it is a fatal variance. 1 Gr. Ev. 82, ยง 64. To prove the
incorporation, the complainants offered in evidence a special
Act of the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
It is entitled "An Act to Incorporate the American Bell Telephone Company." The name of the proposed corporation is
not mentioned in the body of the act. When a corporation is
erected, a name must be given to it, and by that name alone it
must sue and be sued, and do all legal acts. Such name is the
very being of its constitution. The name is the very knot of
the combination, without which it could not perform its corporate functions. Bl. Com. Book I. ch. 18; Angell and Ames
on Corporations (10 ed.), ยง 1; Dartmouth College v. Wfoodward,
4 Wheat. 518, 636. The act is entitled, "An Act to Incorporate
the American Bell Telephone Company." The title cannot
confer the name American Bell Telephone Company upon the
corporation. Potter's Dwarris Stat. 102; Sedgwick Construction of Statutes (2d ed.), pp. 39, 40; .lills v. Wilkins, 6 Mod.
62; Hadden v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 107; Coal Company
v. Slifer, 53 Penn. St. 71 ; Union.PassengerRailway Company's
Appeal, 81 Penn. St. 94. , The special act, offered in evidence,
enacts that Bell and his associates may associate themselves,
and "organize a. corporation according to the provisions of
chapter 224 of the act of the year 1870, and the acts in
amendment thereof and in addition thereto." Chapter 224 of
the act of 1870 and its amendments are now known as chapter
[06 of the Public Statutes of Massachusetts, and so much
thereof as relates to this question is as follows:
"Section 4. Any such number of persons as is hereinafter
provided, who associafe themselves together by such an agreemnent in writing as is hereinafter described, with the intention
of forming a corporation for any purpose hereinafter specified,
upon complying with the provisions of section twenty-one,
shall be and remain a corporation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Ker's Argument for Mlay Commercial Telephone.

"Section 16. Such agreement shall set forth the fact that the
subscribers thereto associate themselves together with the intention of forming a corporation, the corporate name assumed,
the purpose for which -it is formed, th6 town or city, which
shall be in this Commonwealth, in which it is established or
located, the amount of the capital stock, and the par value
and number of its shares.
"Section 17. Any corporate name may be assumed which
indicates that it is a corporation, and which is not in use by
an existing corporation or company; and the name assumed
shall be changed only by act of the General Court. If organized for the purposes mentioned in sections 9 or 10, the words
'co-operative' or 'fishing,' respectively, shall form part of
the name."
To further prove the act of incorporation, complainants
offered in evidence a certificate, under the seal of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, certifying that
.W. H. Forbes and ten other persons had associated themselves
under the name American Bell Telephone Company, with a
capital of seven million three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The special act does not give the persons named in it
power to assume a name. It gives them power to organize a
corporation. The assumption of a name was not one of the
incidents which attached, even by implication, to the powers,
purposes, or objects stated in the act. We are to look at
what the Legislature actually did, and not what it intended to
do. The act was a grant from a sovereign power, and is to be
taken most beneficially for the sovereign, and against the
grantee. 2 Black. Com. 347; Potter's Dwarris on Statutes,

Commonwealt. v. Erie & Nfortlheast Railroad Co., 27 Penn.
St. 339; S. C. 67 Am. Dec. 471. The special act was a
later one. It does not incorporate chapter 224 in its provisions. It refers to chapter 224, by enacting that Bell, and his
associates might "organize a corporation according to the
provisions of chapter 224.' The powers conferred by the.
special act are limited to the precise language used. The language confers no authority upon the Secretary of the Coin-

monwealth to issue such a certificate as has been offered in
evidence. CommonwealtA v. Railway Co., 52 Penn. St. 52;
Bowling Green &c. Railroad Co. v. Warren, County Court, 10
Bush, '711; Mbll, v. Paige, 1 Pick. 43; _Farmers' Loan and
Trust Co. v. Carroll,5 Barb. 613; Angell and Ames on Corporations, ยงยง 81, 111. The Bell Telephone Company of Philadelphia is one of the complainants mentioned in the bill of
complaint. It is described as "a corporation duly established
under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania." Although,
under the pleadings, the complainants were bound to prove
the existence of the corporation, yet there was no act, law,
charter, or evidence cffered to prove that such a corporation
ever did exist.
Mr. Ker also contended that the evidence showed that the
complainants were not entitled to maintain a suit alone against
the respondents; that Bell was not the original inventor of the
inventions described in the patents; that material parts of the
invention had been described in printed publications prior to
the granting of letters patent; that the claims in the patent
were not warranted by the descriptions and specifications set
forth in it, or by the proofs and evidence; and that the apparatus was inherently unfit for telephonic purposes in the
transmission of articulate speech.
Mr. Don X Dickinson for the People's Telephone Company (the Drawbaugh Case) and for the Overland Telephone
Company.
Two leading judgments of this court settle the rules applying
to the issue of priority of invention between Bell and Drawbaugh. These are Gayler v. Wilder (the Fire Proof Safe
Case), 10 How. 4-71, and Coffin v. Ogden (the Reversible Lock
Case), 18 Wall. 120.
The simple question is, did M r. Bell or Mr. Drawbaugh first
conceive and apply the principle of the telephone and "clothe
the conception in substantial forms which demonstrated at
once its practical efficacy and utility?"
The principle is, that of transmitting articulate speech upon

wires by a continuous electric current, with the addition of
means to cause incidental undulations of the current corresponding with the incidental tones of the human voice.
When applied in the electric speaking telephone the practical result is, that the same air vibrations set in motion by the
human voice, and producing sound by their impact upon the
tympanum of the ear, are repeated with comparative exactness
upon the tympamim or diaphragm of the transmitting instrument, are then by the process carried to a distance, and there
with equal exactness repeated upon the tympanum or diaphragn
of the receiver, and thence again repeated upon the tympanum
of the listening ear.
The issue of fact here has been heard and decided upon the
merits but once in any court below.
There was no hearing of this defence betore granting tne
preliminary injunction in the Circuit Court for the Southern
District of New York; and the Circuit Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania-Judges McKennan, Nixon and Butler sitting -refused a preliminary injunction after full hearing
deferring decision until a final decree should be reached on
pleadings and proofs in the Southern District of New York.
So that the only judgment of any court which needs to be attacked by or which can be said to be adverse to this defence is
that of the learned judge of the Circuit Court for the Southern
District of New York which is printed in this record.
Our positions may be summarized as follows:
The defendants' testimony-in-chief, excluding Drawbaugh's,
is of such positive character, relating to exceptional and unusual facts; is so copious from many and widely disconnected
sources, and withal so consistent and harmonious, that, in the
language of the learned Judge below, it "is suft~ientlyformidable to overcome the legal reeumption, of the validity of the
comrplcinant' _patent."
The complainants' proofs in reply, do not, under the settled
policy of the law of evidence, create a flaw upon the face of
the case made, much less destroy it.
Case authorities to the point, that doubtful direct testimony

thrown by evidence of his inconsistent conduct, fraudulent
fabrications or evil tendencies, have no application in weighing
direct evidence of the higher order presented here. If it had
been shown that he was a rogue and a falsifier, Drawbaugh
would not be beyond the pale of the law for the protection of
inventors, if the evidence otherwise established his claim to an
invention.
But Drawbaugh's story, his character and conduct, and the
conditions in which we find him, are all consistent with, and
corroborate, the case otherwise made.
In this regard every premise of the opinion below, upon
which this decree rests, is at fault. These premises are:
(a) That a man of Drawbaugh's education and environment
could not have invented the telephone.
(b)That a man who busies himself with minor "mechanical
contrivances" could not have produced a great invention. In
other words, a great discovery in physics could not be made by
a man unless his mind had always been on great discoveries;
an a priori argument that to establish a claim to a great invention, the claimant must show some previous invention
approximately as great.
(o)That the issue of an advertising card, to the farmers,
millers, mechanics and housewives of a country village, soliciting trade for his shop, is an admission that he was not working upon and had no telephone at a period when seventy
unimpeached witnesses, and himself, testify positively that he
had the telephone, and that he was so working at that time.
(d) That Drawbaugh fabricated the story of his poverty,
when the court records of his judicial district show judgment
after judgment against hhn, on claims for the necessaries of
life, medical attendance for his fatally ill children, and for the
roof that covered his head; and when the community in which
he lived corroborates the record.
(e) That Drawbaugh was a charlatan, because a provincial
scribbler was florid in the style of a printed notice of him.
(V) That Drawbaugh and these witnesses, when they say
that they talked through the more or less crude instruments
made prior to 18*75, falsify or are mistaken in their statements
on the following grounds:

โข339

OCTOBER TERM, 187.
Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

Some of the original parts have been lost or worn out, two
sets of reproductions were made, both in exact correspondence
with the original machines, and when tested at different times,
one set being older and shaken out of adjustment, did not work
perfectly; though the other with accurate and firm adjustments, stood all the tests as practical telephones.
The earliest possible date at which Bell's conception of the
magmeto instrument can be fixed is June 2, 1875.
Then from an accident in his experiment to the "Spring"
instrument he was led to prepare a sketch for M:fr. George
Brown of Toronto. This sketch as her testifies was of his instrument of July, 1875, which was the result of experiments
following and caused by the accident of June 2, 1875. He
his own hand: "1.Fbrstatplaced upon the sketch the words in
i
tempt to transmit tie Ibeman voice.
We present a history from the first idea conceived by Drawbaugh, of transmitting articulate speech over a telegraph wire
in 1859-60, through various experiments by which the conception finally took on mechanical, though rude forms, and
became of practical use, down to the finished and nicely
adjusted mechanism; all prior to this as the date of Bell's
invention.
This history rests for its general truthfulness, and for the
accuracy of its details, not upon the testimony of interested
witnesses; not upon the testimony of one, two, six or a dozen,
but upon the direct and positive testimony of an entire community, and of the frequent and occasional visitors to that community, representing all classes of citizens, in every trade and
occupation.
Over two hundred persons testify to knowledge of Drawbaugh's telephones as an accomplished inlention prior to the
date of Bells.. Over seventy talked through the machine.
Over one hundred and thirty saw the machines, and most of
these identify instruments.
There is nothing of inherent improbability in the proposition that so many people of various occupations and employments can give direct testimony in this case, as the fact comes
in naturally, and is conceded on all sides, that in the country

TELEPHONE OASES.

village of Eberly's Mills, well known throughout that part of
the country, Drawbwugh's shop was a common resort for
many people of the village and of the country side, and it
was a place to which visitors were frequently taken as a place
of local note, while Drawbaugh himself was considered a
remarkable man among the people.
The great mass of evidence for the defence is essentially
not of a class frequently criticised in such cases as being dependent upon the memories of illiterate or careless witnesses
as to conversations, statements, or even plans and specifications with or submitted by an alleged inventor at some former
time; but on the contrary is that kind of testimony which in
every branch of the profession is admitted to be even superior
to that of a mere learned or scientific person, where it bears
upon the practical truth of novel results and effects as facts.
There is no room for mistake.
It cannot be conceived that any honest witness could have
made a mistake, or that his memory could be beguiled by
imagination, "wrought upon by influences to which his ears
were subjected," as to his having done so marvellous a thing
as conversing through a machine and recognizing the tones of
a human voice, at a distance over telegraph wires, at the time
in question.
In the condition of the art, and of their knowledge at the
time, a greater proportion of such witnesses would be impressed by such a fact as by a miracle.
So strong and vigorous was this class of testimony that the
court below was constrained to hold as we have seen that
"the case made by these witnesses is sufficiently formidable
to overcome the legal presumption of the validity of the
complainants' patent."
It is true that in all branches of jurisprudence instances are
frequent in the cases, and illustrations common in the books,
of the fallibility of direct testimony, from honest mistake.
Such instances and illustrations occur and are drawn,
throughout the history of the law of evidence, from one
general class of oral testimony.
It is that which depends for credence upon the unaided

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and OverLand Cos.

memory of the witness, in relation to some ordinary thing,
not unusual, unnatural' or striking, in and of itself. Thus, the
testimony of an honest witness to the fact merely, that at a
.certain time and place, he saw two individuals together might
be successfully assailed, while the statement of the same witness that he saw them together, and saw one of them strike
the other or shoot the other, would be invulnerable.
So, by the same rule, direct testimony by the average witness as to ordinary conversations or statements at a distance
of time, may be as unreliable as his recollection of the contents in detail of a letter, which, intrinsically, or to the witness, was of no particular interest; in both instances becoming
less reliable in proportion to the lapse of time. Such evidence,
while it may be competent, has little weight.
So, memory of such witness as to statements, and plans and
sketches of inventors in ordinary machinery, or extraordinary
machinery used for ordinary purposes; and even aa to the
parts and adjustment of the mechanical parts of such
machine..
The history of patent litigation, judgments of courts in
such cases, and the complainants' brief below and here, teem
with modern instances of the application of proper caution
and of absolute decision against this kind of direct evidence.
It is doubtless true that the misty and lineless impressions of
men, especially of the unskilled and unlearned in the art,
might easily be beguiled by subsequent events, interest or
influences, into giving out a seemingly honest but mistaken
description of well-defined parts and accurate adjustments.
Strong circumstantial should overcome direct evidence in such
cases, as in the Howe ew'ng -Aachine .Cae, 1 Fish. Pat.
Cas. 162.
But the testimony here attacked is as far beyond the range
of that doctrine as the target of a Columbiad is beyond, the
range of a bird gun.
Other and equally well-settled rules apply; if the circumstances narrated were likely to attract the attention of a person "in consequence of their importance, either intrinsic or
with relation to himself, doubt is resolved in favor of the
memory of the witness."

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

It is said of the King of Siam that he believed everything
the Dutch traveller told him, until he said that in Europe the
water in winter became so solid that men and even elephants
could walk upon it. This, his majesty said, was impossible,
and at once accused his entertainer of lying. (Locke, on
the Human Understanding.) There can be little doubt that
after the .interview, the monarch's memory remained good of
the fact that he had been told of this thing, and he would
have remained a good witness to that particular part of the
conversation for the rest of his life. If, in addition, he. had
been, for the first time, brought to view and test the ice of a
frozen river in a country-where water sometimes freezes in the
season of winter, his testimony, at any subsequent period, that
the water was frozen on the particular day of his view of the
wonder, would be worth that of a hundred residents of its
banks who should testify from mere memory, that the river
was or was not frozen on that day.
In this case we have hundreds of witnesses whose circumstances and relations are in perfect harmony with the theory
that they could have seen and heard the thing alleged if it
had occurred; each individual describing either the knowledge
of his own senses of a result, or of the hearing of a result,
which, if in fact it occurred, or if in fact he heard of it, was
the most startling and unheard-of thing in all his experience.
To him it was a sharp and vigorous departure from the course
of nature; becoming known of men, this thing equally moved
and astonished the civilized world. As put by the learned
Judge below, "a result of transcendent scientific interest,"
and the greatest by far of all the marvels of the electric
telegrap.
Imagine a suit for an infringement against Fulton, and the
testimony of a witness that he was on board on the trial trip,

he was beguiled by his imagination into honestly thinking
that he saw the boat propelled against the current by steam
or by unseen forces!
In the then state of knowledge, especially in the community of Eberly's Mills, the transmission of the voice by wire,

and of the tones of the voice by-electrical machinery beyond
ordinary hearing distance, was to present such a marvel as to
challenge attention in the very nature of things.
It was not merely a wdnderful mechanical contrivance like
the sewing machine, which accomplished the seemingly improbable combination in mechanics, which could perform rapidly and perfectly a familiar work; but this was an unseen
and mysterious cause, whose processes wkre not discoverable
to the vision, whose force seemed rather of the unnatural, and
whose.'esuZts alone impressed the mind and memory.
No detail of mere machinery or adjustment needs to be
remembered. If the machine talked, and the witness heard
it, there can be no doubt of the accuracy the impression made.
If the machine talked, we might well dispense with the fallible memory of some unlearned and unskilled witnesses as to
the mechanism employed, because we know that the appliances used in the magneto and variable resistance instruments
were the invention here iii issue, as none others would or can
transmit articulatd speech by the electric current upon wires.
This brings, us to another oft-repeated criticism of several
individual witnessesi for the defence. If the shrewdest and
most able cross-examinition could lead a witness to say that
he had seen and talked through a certain instrument of the
exhibits in evidence, identifying it, when it could be argued
that at the exact time of the act the particular instrument
identified was not perfected or in use, according td the testimony of Drawbaugh, or some other witness, the learned counsel profess themselves satisfied,- and urge the court to agree
with them, that the testimony is quite demolished. Their theory as to the fallibility of honest, direct testimony, give. by
the unskilled and unlearned, as to the existence of the machines, here disappears, and in its place we have the proposition that these particular witnesses are wicked falsifiers; and
this, of ignorant-men and women, fl Pennsylvania farmers, guIlible now, and gullible then," 'as counsel are pleased to call
them.,
While we have -the testimony of the learned, as well as of

strongest possible corroboration of their statements, and the
strongest -possible contradiction of the complainants' position
(that these many witnesses either falsified wilfully, in concert,
from corrupt collusion, or from the unconscious effect of consultation or "village tavern gossip "), that they do not agree
in their memories of the, to them, novel parts of the instrument; or are at fault or are mistaken as to the identity of the
instruments, or of the difference between the carbon or variable resistance machines and the magneto machines.
They are agreed in memory of the great, conclusive fact,
that this machine di&talk.
Running through the testimony from the population at and
about Eberly's Mills, and its frequent visitors, we find repeated
and constantly appearing support of the main facts testified
to, in perfectly natural and consistent collateral matters.
For instance, we find the unlearned and unskilled remembering well the talking machine, when clothed in the familiar
garb of a tin mustard box or common glass tumbler, and forgetting other details; we find others remembering the instruments with any peculiarity about them, like the spiral 'magnet,
better than they can recall other parts, as that particularly
struck their attention, and naturally would do so; we find the
blacksmith remembering the shape and position of the permanent magnet witu which he is familiar, and forgetting all
about the electro-magnet, of which he knew nothing; we find
many remember the common horse-shoe magnet as used, because they knew before what it was. We find a farmer, like
Fetters, recalling all the details for applying electricity about
the machines, but cease to wonder at his accuracy, when we
find that the -farmer had at some time before greatly inter
ested himself about practical electrical machinery. We find
the more familiar in such matters giving more details; the
totally ignorant in such matters giving no details at all. The
very diversity of detail, the absence of concurrence in circumstance, in occasion, and in time, presents this mass of testimony as impregnable against the complainants' theory, that
it is the product of consultation or of prearrangement.
Neither their sharpest cross-examination, nor their swarm

hint of it, even in the conversations with his co-conspirators;.
yet if he has, the secret agents of the complainants, among the
friends and neighbors of the conspirators, have not found it,
out. The breaking down of two or three, and no more, of thewitnesses called upon the question of dates, strongly aids in
the demonstration that the mass are unshaken in their testimony. It is rather further evidence that we have called the.
population to testify, and that in every community there are.
one, two, or three, covetous of the ephemeral distinction of the.
witness-stand, of the importance of figuring in a case of so much

Care has been taken, however, in summoning witnesses to,
testify, to call no man whose character or whose word could
be successfully impeached by any methods known to the law.
And it.is remarkable, we submit, that in a case of this magnitude, with every means and resource at their command, the
complainants, after years of effort and search in near and in
the most remote paths, and in every collateral by-way, now
rest the charges of conspiracy and of gullibility against these
witnesses, only upon the bare statements of counsel. The
lives of all the witnesses are clean, their characters for truth
and veracity unassailed, and the evidence of any attempt to
influence the memory or the impressions of any man calle,
cannot be successfully pointed out in this record.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

We submit in our brief an analysis of the testimony, and
call particular attention to the absolute certainty of the dates
as fixed by collateral matters in every instance.
Complainants' Testimony.
As tending to show that Drawbaugh did not invent and use
in his shop the electric speaking telephone, as testified to by
the witnesses for the defence, the complainants introduced
forty-eight witnesses from Eberly's Mills and from various
parts of the United States, who are put upon the stand for the
purpose of showing that they never saw the machines in his
shop, and never heard them sjoken of.
We shall see that of these but ten stand the test of crossexamination and rebuttal, even as to the point to which they
testify; while the ten are disposed of on other grounds.
Among these witnesses, the first and most important, and one
whose means of knowledge and relations with Drawbaugh are
claimed to strengthen complainants' theory more than any
other witness, is Theophilus Weaver.
He describes himself as a "solicitor of patents, patternmaker, builder, and experimental machinery manufacturer,"
and as "counsel in patent cases."
He testifies that he had acted in getting up specifications for
Drawbaugh in various minor inventions, and, in a word presents himself as the man to whom Drawbaugh would most
likely make known his telephone inventions, if they had
existed. He then proceeds to testify, in chief, that he never
knew that Drawbaugh bad invented a telephone until the first
half of 1878, and then it was a mere device to be connected
with a clock, "to announce the hours vocally."
It transpired in his cross-examination that he had been
employed by the complainants to get up testimony in the
neighborhood, and to influence sentiment in the community,
and had been so employed by an agent of the complainants,
who was visiting the vicinity under an assumed name. It also
appeared that he was not on good terms with Drawbaugh, for
the reason that he, the witness, had grossly betrayed Drawbaugh as a client in a patent litigation, and had also attempted

340"

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
M1r. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

to pirate the invention himself by applying for an "improvement" upon it. He then endeavored to betray the person to
whom he betrayed Drawbaugh. We cite the pages bf the
record to these points.
The cross-examination shows conclusively that this man has
little notion of honor, and no regard for his word. It was a
common practice with him to act as counsel or solicitor for
mechanics, and others seeking patents on inventions, and then
appropriate to himself the knowledge thus obtained in a professional capacity, by patenting "improvements" upon thep.
The man paints his own character clearly, and stamps his
own testimony as unworthy of credence; a man of doubtful methods and of an easy conscience, we find him the accredited agent of the complainants, and he stands at the threshold
of their testimony.
Complainants also called David A. Hauck in the same line
of negative testimony. He is the person with whom Drawbaugh had the suit in which Mr. Weaver was counsel, above
referred to. It appears clearly, from his cross-examination,
that he was adjudged, both by the Examiner of Interferences,
and subsequently upon appeal by the Board of Chief Examiners, to have made grave misstatements. Both these tribunals
found not only that he had done so as to the facts in the
case, but that his statements upon filing his application for a
patent had not been true; that he was not at all the inventor
of the faucet in.controversy, but had it from his opponentDrawbaugh. He testified that, although frequently in Drawbaugh's shop, he had never seen any talking machine .and
never heard of one.
Without regard to the personal feeling or the character of
the witnesses, especially in view of the fact that they contradict
an exceptional number of men and women testifying as strongly
to the memory of a positive and wonderful fact, we urge that
this case affords an exceptionally striking illustration of the
wisdom of.those settled legal rules for valuing evidence, which
give great weight to positive, and little weight to negative
testimony.
This court has said of this rule, in Stit v. lluidekopem'a, 17

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickinson's Aigument for People's and Overland Cos.

Wall. 384, 394: "The court charged the jury, that 'it is a rule of
presumptions, that ordinarily a witness who testifies to an affirmative is to be preferred to bne who testifies to a negative,
because he who testifies to a negative may have forgotten. It
is possible to forget a thing that did happen; it is not possible
to forget a thing that has never existed.' We are of the opinion that the charge was a sound exposition of a recognized
rule of evidence of frequent application." See Collection of
Cases, 141 U. S. Dig. 642; Gilbert on Evidence, 140; 1 Stark.

Ev. ยง 32.
While no person possessing a memory could well forget having talked through one of these machines at the time in question,
yet it may be true, that persons called to testify (as they are)
that they never heard of it years before, or did not see it, tell
the truth, from lack of opportunity to see or hear it. A very
few, honest and disinterested, may be an exception to the rule,
and may have actually forgotten the conversation or the view..
The differentiation in the ability of persons to recall facts,
or impressions from the eye and ear, of things and conversations
not in and of themselves remarkable, is a matter of common
observation. In respect of this, may be considered the difference between the man of many affairs and the man of
few; between the man of mental occupation and the man of
other pursuits; between the man devoted to his own interests
and the man interested in the affairs of his neighbors; and,
finally, the difference of age and temperament which affect
the proposition, that all men having seen or heard of a thing
likely to make a greater or less impression, as men may vary,
all would remember it.
And, too, the average lay mind has never yet comprehended
that "don't remember" may not be resorted to in cases of
self-interest; to avoid enmity, or to please a friend; or that it
can amount to perjury or any wrong. Upon that answer no
prosecution for perjury ever did stand, because of the practical
impossibility of proving of the particular witness that his power
of memory was equal to that of other men. No physical or
psychological research, and no expert, could afford the proof,
whether h- in fact did remember; and witnesses are more

Mr..Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

easily influenced not to remember, as has been done according.
to the evidence in repeated instances, as shown by the record.
The usual question put to these witnesses was substantially
as follows: "If Mr. Drawbaugh, for five or six years before
speaking telephones were heard of elsewhere, had at his shop
-a talking machine, by which people at different places could
carry on conversation with each other along a wire, and had
frequently shown it to people, and had had them carry on conversation over it, so that they knew that it would do what he
claimed for it, and had represented that it was going to supersede the telegraph, do you think you would have known of
it?" And so the witnesses are made to swear, not only to
the premises and conclusion of the syllogism of counsel, but
also fo his syntax and rhetoric.
There is one consideration appearing in complainants' own
proofs that is at once conclusive against the value of this testimony. With a few exceptions, the entire number of witnesses
are offered to give testimony tending to show:
(1) That the telephone never existed in Drawbaugh's shop
prior to the Bell patent; and
(2) That it was not heard of in the community prior to the
Bell patent.
With the few exceptions, to which we shall refer, the witnesses testify not only that they did not hear of the machines
or know of them from 1867 to 1876, but go further and extend
the period to 1878 and 1879 and 1880; so that by fixing the
dates, the strength of their testimony is no greater to the point
that the machines did not exist up to 1876, than that they did
not exist in the later years mentioned. If not seeing or bearing of them establishes that they were not there up to 1876,
the not seeing or hearing of them by the samp witnesses in the
same circumstances and conditions, in 1877, ,1878 and 1879,
would establish that they were not there in the latter years;
but we have from the mouths of the complainants' own witnesses offered to prove that Drawbaugh's later machines could
not have been constructed as early as 1876, because he showed
the earlier ones, that there can be no question that at the
earlier dates of 1876, 1877 and 1878, machines were in the shop

Afr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

in such a condition that they were perfect telephones, though
in ruder forms than the later ones.
(Counsel here read at length from the testimony of complainants' witnesses, in illustration.)
As an illustration of the unsafety and utter worthlessness of
this negative testimony, that of Nesbit is cited. He was called
to prove that Drawbaugh did not mention-telephones in 1878.
Nesbit was there for the purpose of getting materials for an
historical sketch of Milltown. In connection with his testimony
the history compiled from the material was introduced, and it
was silent as to the telephone, although treating quite fully of
Daniel Drawbaugh. Upon the production of a manuscript
made by Hull at the very same visit N6sbit made, it was shown
conclusively that Drawbaugh did mention the telephones, both
carbon and magneto, as his invention ("two kinds of telephiones"). This manuscript is shown in the cross-examination
of Nesbit, and then, on the demand of counsel, the complainants were obliged to put in another copy of the same history,
which contained an appendix, with the substance of Hull's
manuscript statement about telephones.
This testimony proves something else besides the unreliability of negative testimony.
Nesbit was an intelligent and honest man, telling of a comparatively recent visit, and had it not been for this manuscript
his testimony would have stood to the effect that Drawbaugh
Aid not mention telephones, and that he, Nesbit, did not hear
of them there. It appears with perfect clearness that the
agents of the complainants over and over again interviewed
persons in Eberly whose memories were positive against their
theories, and then failed to call them.
In this connection the history of the two Gregorys is interesting. One of the sharpest criticisms made upon the Drawbaugh defence at the first hearing was that those engaged
about the shop with Drawbaugh, as workmen, were not
called, and that it followed from the defendants' failure to
call them, as well as by the testimony of Jacob Carnes, a
workman for the complainant, that Drawbaugh's statement
and the story of the witnesses for the defence were incredible,

Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People'ยง and Overland Cos.

beqause the very workmen about the shop did not know of his
telephone.
Before the second hearing in the Overland case, Emanuel
Gregory, a member of th. Drawbaugh Manufacturing Company in 1870, and his son, who worked in the shop in 1870,
were found living in Massachusetts. They both of them testified they had not been in the State of Pennsylvania from the
10th day of December, 1870, until the day when they gave
their testimony. They further testified that while at work in
the shop with Drawbaugh they had many times talked
.through the telephone with him and aided in his experiments.
It appeared further that they had been, visited by the agents
of the complainants, and had made their statements to them
in regard to this matter before the first hearing of the cause.
Of this, class of witnesses, that which seemed to the Circuit
Court to be most conclusive agqinst the defence, is that of Mr.
James P. Matthews, managing editor of the Baltimore Amerioan.-He has the place of honor in th'e opinion; as the court
observed, "with a memory unusually retentive and active,"
and as "a careful, conscientious man."
- He testifies that he went to the shop of Drawbaugh especially to see the electric clock in April, 1878, and he made
some brief notes of what he learned, and subsequently wrote
from them an article for his paper, published Vovember 28,
1878. His testimony is chiefly to the point that he understood from Drawbaugh, at the intetview in April, that, while
he had experimented somewhat upon telephones, yet he never
expected to transmit articulate speech, and that he saw there
"no telephone, and nothing that looked like a telephone."
This testimony is of the same class as several newspaper articles of 1878, tending to show that Drawbaugh was merely experimenting. The article in question is a tissue of errors in its
conception and description of the clock which it purpoits to
describe, and would of itself stamp that portion of the evidence as without value. The witnesses subsequently wrote a
letter (Appendix, Add. proofs, p. 776) to complainants' counsel, called out in the argument below, in which he says: "I
ought to have said in my affidavit, and in my subsequent ex-

amination, that at the time of the interview I had probably
never seen a working telephone, and knew little or nothing
about its mode of operation. The impression in the newspaper
paragraph referred to may have been modified, colored or
changed by conversations with other people on the subject
after the interview and before the article was written." ie
further states in his letter, that, "the two wooden hemispheres," which he testified that Drawbaugh showed as parts
of the telephone, and had been in his hands, he was mistaken
about, and he cannot say whether Drawbaugh touched them
or said anything about them. Further: "My recollection of
the whole transaction is so vague that I never ought to have
ventured to say anything about it, and the portions of my testimony relating to this matter certainly ought not to be considered by the court in making up its decision." He had testified that his impression was that Drawbaugh had entirely
thrown aside telephone experiments; but he is contradicted in
this by the complainants' own witnesses, Shapley, D. A. Landis,
0. A. Landis, Orlando Kanney, A. L. Rupp, Geo. 0. Rupp,
Henry IR. Mosser and Theodore Grisinger. If this were not
enough as to the testimony of this witness, held by the court
below to be of sufficient importance to figure as a chief factor
in the destruction of the defence, we now quote from the complainants' own brief in the court below, bearing in mind Matthews' testimony is material and competent only as showing
there was no telephone at Drawbaugh's shop in April, 1878,
and that all there ever was of it was futile experiment, as follows (Brief below, p. 20):
"Our belief is that the tunzblei' instrument was Xrst made as
an electric speaking telep)hone in 1877-8; they could say no
less, as their theory had been, and their witnesses had sustained it, that the electric telephone was there not only in the
winter of 1877-8, but also in October, 1876.
It is evident that the complainants were not seeking the
truth so much as witnesses to sustain their theory, and that
even for this purpose negative testimony is obtained not as
representing the knowledge of the community upon the subjects testified about, but, after being carefully culled and

Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

selected, because it was thought, from the lapse of memory,
from susceptibility to influence, or from other cause, the witnesses would be able to say, at least, that they had not seen
th6 telephone, in such language as might be put into their
mouths under the manipulation of shrewd examiners. The
whole of it should be laid oui of consideration.
The testimony of Kieffer and Wilson, persons to whom
Drawbaugh had shown other inventions, and to whom he
talked about his electrical business, standing by itself, has
force; nevertheless, they are negative witnesses, and they cannot stand against the positive testimony of men who saw and
talked through the telephone, remember the words, and identify the instruments.
Still, it is conceded that such negative testimony as Kieffer's
and Wilson's and Lloyd's, unexplained and unanswered, would
have greater value than that of ordinary negative testimony,
and the Circuit Judge has given it almost controlling weight,
because they were men with whom Drawbaugh had conversations about other inventions -and electrical experiments, and
because he did not speak of the telephone to them, and to
whom it is assumed he would open his heart freely on the subject. As stated in the opinion in this connection, naming these
witnesses with Weaver and Hlauck (supra): "1The proofs show
that during the years from 1868 to 1878 he did not attempt to
avail himself of opportunities for demonstrating his invention
and bringing it to the notice of his friends, who were peculiarly qualified to appreciate it and were favorably circumstanced to assist him."
Without referring to the possible effect of influence upon
the memories of these witnesses and complainants' influences
upon all, we propose to show right here the radical error of
this proposition, and to show by positive testimony that it
has no material basis to rest upon.
Mr. Kieffer, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Lloyd resided at Harrisburg, and were men of character without doubt. David A.
Hauck resided at Mechanicsburg, and did not know Drawbaugh
until he went to Eberly's Mills in the spring of 1873, for the
Hauck Manufacturing Company. He is the witness heretofore discussed as having a litigation with Drawbaugh.

TELEPHONE CASES.
fr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

We reply as follows:
1. By the testimony of men of equal or of higher standing
than these who figure in the opinion, who were more intimate
and more likely to be applied to by Drawbaugh, that he did
repeatedly apply to them and explain his invention to them;
and,
2. As one reason why he did not speak of the telephone
to the witnesses named in the opinion, or apply to them for
help, that he was laughed at, derided and denounced as crazy
by those men who knew him best, and were of as high character as those to whom he did not apply.
[Counsel here read from the testimony of twenty-seven
witnesses on the first point and of many others on the second.]
We suggest that it would be presumable on such proof,
aside from other reasons going to rebut this testimony, that
the three or four witnesses testifying that Drawbiugh did not
-speakto them were omitted by him, because of discouragement
or diffidence or experience of repeated rebuff, rather than that
the positive testimony of himself, and of so many witnesses of
-character, is wickedly false.
Even Drawbaugh and his witnesses should now and then
have the benefit of the old-fashioned, and still not obsolete,
presumption, in favor of truth and honesty.
It was said by the learned Circuit Judge, that it was incredible that the statement of the witnesses could be true -that
they could remember the words that they heard through the
telephone.
We respectfully submit, that the criticism would be an apt
as it is a usual one, if made of ordinary conveesations, when
the witness, after a long period of time, attempts to give the
-exact words; but, when a man is relating an exceptional experience, an astonishing result, a mystery connected with
spoken words -it would be more incredible if he did not remember it.
Decrees and judgments cannot be based upon such reasoning, or against such testimony as we present, and they have
not been.

the testimony, but to the somewhat vague and ill-defined
theory of the inherent incredibility of the defence, and especially of the story of Daniel Drawbaugh himself.
We defer a discussion of the overwhelming evidence adduced and remaining uncontradicted in support of the priority
of Drawbaugh's conception and invention, to consider somewhat the story of Drawbaugh as given in evidence, and Drawbaugh himself.
1 now call Attention to -DanielDrawbaughas a Witness.
At the outset, in considering Drawbaugh as a witness, there
can be no question but.that his history of himself and of his
experiments and labors upon the electric speaking telephone
from 1860 to 1879, inclusive, must be either a truthful statement, or one manufactured, in general and in detail, by a
wicked mind; a mass of irredeemable perjury from beginning
to end; and yet, none of the legitimate methods known to the
profession but have.been applied in this case, and no resource
has failed to bring these methods to bear for the purpose of
breaking down that testimony.
Upon the courso and paths of his life, and his relations
and dealings with all men from his boyhood down to his fiftyeighth year, the complainants have focused a light which has
made luminous every detail.
Presumably, if his testimony could have been impeached,
either by attacking his character or contradicting his statements by the direct testimony of others, it would have been
resorted to. But we find that notwithstanding his difficulties,
lawsuits, and controversies -with men, by the testimony in behalf of the complainants, as well as of the defendants, that he
bore a character, and had a life record, whose honesty and
truthfulness could not be assailed. All bear testimony to his
steadiness, his industry, his enthusiasm in physics, and especially in electric science. The worst that any man ever said
of him was that he was crazy on the subject of the talking
machine.
The record is full of evidence of the employment of
"agents" from the community by the complainants in a

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickinson's Argmment for People's and Overland Cos.

search for matter wherewith to attack him. So that on the
theory of the complainants and the theory of this decree, the
wickedness and devilish cunning by which he sought to impose a fraud upon the public and to work out a great robbery
must have been conceived after the publication of Bell's invention in 1876 ; and to further the scheme, that this witness
fabricated a history in every detail and incident bearing on
the controversy, covering a period of twenty years and over.
Ile must have made and partially made telephones, having
the necessary and harmonious appearance of age, of the most
ingenious description, and prepared his story in that regard to
stand the most scientific cross-examination in every detail,
aided by trained experts.
While it may be true that a man may become suddenly vile,
and change and radically contradict the evidence of the course
of his life, and while there may be one or two or three illustrations of such monstrosities in the history of human nature,
yet it has never been true in the history of jurisprudence that
a fabricated story, lying in its general plan and lying il its
detail, covering a long period and a series of transactions, could
stand the tests applied to it in the courts of justice.
Drawbaugh's testimony covers 332 pages of closely printed
matter in this record, of which 180 pages are cross-examination, and we think it may be said that the complainants commanded every available resource and all the ability and
knowledge, both scientific, legal and common, in this work
that could by any possibility be put into an attempt to break
a witness by cross-examination.
A careful reading of this testimony, it seems to us, is convincing of itself and by itself of the truth of the story. The
very faults of his memory, the immaterial contradictions and
changing of immaterial dates only go to strengthen the conviction that the history as related is genuine and truthful. It
is without a trace of the inflexibility which characterizes fabrication. The man that speaks is in harmony with 'the history
of the man's character as related; in harmony with all
knowledge of the honest, ingenuous, open-minded genius, as
portrayed by the account of his life.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

He will not corroborate Eberly, a preceding witness, as to
a conversation in 1861-64 which was greatly in his favor, for
the reason that he "cannot remember it."
He will not corroborate Lowrey's testimony that he was.
shown the cup instrument by Drawbaugh at an early time.
He says: "I have been trying to recall it, but I cannot."
If he were cunning and corrupt, he certainly could, when
examined in 1881, have been able to describe a rude receiving
instrument, as he had described a rude transmitting one. Yet
he says he cannot remember the first experiment in receivers,
because there were so many different attempts and trials (11
Defts., p. 760), and so the instances of fairness occur throughout his testimony.
Drawbaugh not a -Learned 'an.

It is said by the complainants that Drawbaugh was not a
learned man, and among the arguments to support their
theory of inherent incredibility, they say in effect that in the
nature of things, no one but a scientist from the curriculum of
the schools could have invented the telephone; that it was
beyond his mental grasp; and it is said to sustain this proposition, that his inventions were of barrel machinery, jig-saws,
nail-plate feeders, measuring faucets, and sundry electrical
contrivances; or, as suggested by counsel, "mere mechanical
contrivances and improvements;" and the fact of his busying
himself with other inventions in mechanical contrivances is
further used in support of the theory of inherent incredibility,
as showing that he could not have conceived or had his mind'
upon so great a discovery as that of the transmission of
articulate speech.
So far as the learning is concerned, we believe it can beshown that successful inventors axe not the product of the
universities, but of natural conditions and of tendencies common enough in American civilization. The tendency here is
to learn and advance by experience. American genius cannot
be said to be produced, though. greatly aided, by school training and discipline. Genius is innate, and the man possessing
it. who, even without books, learns of a natural principle or

can portray upon the human mind the impression of a landscape that the actual view will give. No mere theory, though
learned in all its technical formule, can give the accurate and

Humboldt, in his "Personal Narrative of Travels in South
America" (1799-1804), vol. 2, Bohn's ed., p. 111, says: "We

men in Europe possess. All these articles had not been purchased in the United States; they were the work of a man
who had never seen any instrument, who had no person to.
consult, and who was acquainted with the phenomena of. electricity only by reading the treatise of de Lafond and Franklin's Memoirs. Sefior Carlos del Pozo, the name of this enlightened and ingenious man, had begun to make cylindrical
electrical machines by employing large glIss jars, after having
cut off the necks. It was only within a few years he had
beefh able to procure, by way of Philadelphia, two plates, to
construct a plate machine, and to obtain more considerable
effects.

which appeared to be copied from his own."

did nothing.

Michael Faraday was the son of a blacksmith, and a bookbinders apprentice. After attending four lectures of Sir
Humphry Davy, he gave his attention to practical experiments with electricity. J. Clark Maxwell, Professor of Physics, Cambridge, says, of Faraday's "Experimental Researches,"
resulting in the discovery of the induction current: "It was at
once made the subject of investigation by the whole scientific
world, but some of the most experienced physicists were unable
to avoid mistakes in stating, in what they conceived the more
scientific language than Faraday's, the phenomena before
them."
3faxwell on Electricity is largely devoted to reconciling
the practical methods of Faraday with the theories of the professors,
Hugh Miller's great conceptions took form when, without
education, he was working as a laborer at the Cromarty stone
yards.
Ampere worked out difficult mathematical problems with
sticks and stones before he had learned the names or forms of
figures.
But, says the court below, "Drawbaugh was not only untutored, but he was isolated by his associations and occupation
from contact with .men of advanced science;" and on such reasoning it is found that he must be a swindler, because he dares
to pretend that he invented the telephone.
But it is said Drawbaugh busied himself with mechanical
contrivances of comparative insignificance.
In 1793, Robert Fulton conceived the idea of propelling
vessels by steam, and we find, by a reference to his life (C. D.
Colden, 1817): "His time was also much engrossed by devising a method of superseding the locks of canals by a plane of
double incline, on which he obtained a patent in 1794. In the
same year we find him obtaining patents for flax-spinning and
rope-twisting machines and various other mechanical inventions," bearing upon the construction of canals. In 1797 he
went to Paris and resided thereseven years, during which time
he projected the first panorama ever exhibited, and made important experiments in submarine explosives. It was not until

1806 that he made his successful experiment in propelling vessels with steam in America, and not until 1809 that he took
out his first patent.
Guttenburg, pending the tardy recognition of his discovery
of the art of printing, was engaged upon inventions for new
methods of polishing stones, and manufactured looking-glasses.
Franklin found time to acquire something of income from the
printing-press invention, from improvements in stoves, "Poor
Richard's Almanac," and various other contrivances.
Again, the attack is made upon the credibility of this story,
upon the ground that such an invention would have been
widely known, and would have commanded all the resources
necessary to present it to the public. The great success of
Bell after the exposition of 1876 is cited as an illustration. We
suggest the marked contrast between the presentation of Bell's
alleged invention, under the sanction of international commissioners, framed in the authority of the World's Exhibition at
Philadelphia, and the invention of Drawbaugh, in the lowly
village shop of Milltown, in a by-way not merely of the world,
but a by-way of the State of Pennsylvania, and a by-way of
County of Cumberland. We submit that the complainants
can take nothing of benefit from the fact that such men as
lived in that community, and such men as passed that way,
should not care to invest in any telephone, which seemed a
mystery and a novelty, but of no .practical utility to the learned
and the rich of the great cities, long after Bell's patents were
issued.
Morse conceived the idea of the electric telegraph on the
packet ship Sully, in 1832, and on that voyage made his
rough drafts of the apparatus. For twelve years thereafter
he struggled with poverty to perfect his invention, and to secure any consideration for it. During this struggle he denied
himself the common necessaries of life. Not until 1836 was
he able to exhibit it to his friends. In 1843 lie got it sufficiently before the public to secure an appropriation, and it was
used for the first time on the 24th of May, 1844.

failure to get friends or capital interested in the sewing maVOL. cxxvi-23

chine in this country or in England. He never advanced to
fame and fortune until his controversy commenced with
Singer.
"And yet," says the learned court, following the theory of
counsel, _,such an invention is of a kind well calculated to excite public interest and to impress practical men with a quick
appreciation of its commercial importance and its pecuniary
,value,

and its efficiency and importance as a factor,

in human intercourse could have been demonstrated to the
public without appreciable inconvenience or expense. Drawbaugh fully appreciated its importance and value. He had
the means to patent it himself, and friends to assist him in
introducing it into public use. He had the talent to induce
others to invest in his invention."
No better answer can be found than in Bell's own case.

ExcetionaZ Treatment of the -Defence.
Now, what is there in this case that so distinguishes it in
the domain of judicial investigation as to require a reversal of
settled rules of evidence ?
Direct and positive affirmative evidence, unimpeached and
uncontradicted, seems to have failed of legal virtue when applied to this particular controversy; and the rule as to presumptions is so radically altered that the testimony of four
doubtful witnesses, that they did not hear of a fact - nay,
that they did not remember hearing of it - shall be received
as finally closing the door against the possibility of its existence, and against the recognition of all direct and positive testimony of twenty-seven equally credible men and women, that
they actually did see and hear of the thing.
Yet, we are told that if "he" (Drawbaugh) "had a practical telephone to exhibit, he would have selected just such
men" as Kieffer, and Wilson, and Lloyd (who was "taken
good care of," Complts., 1, 480); and Hauck (who was Draw-

baugh's enemyand of doubtful veracity), "to demonstrate it
to them and to enlist them to demonstrate its utility and value

to the public."

And although he did apply to twenty-seven

others, it is conclusively assumed that he did not have a telephone, because he did not apply to these four gentlemen. As
well might it have been assumed that Howe did not invent the
sewing-machine, because it appeared after repeated attempts
among- his nearest friends, after suffering contumely and reproach in these efforts, that his heart and courage so failed him
that he ceased his applications and departed for.England without risking further coldness and refusal.
But it seems that this case is not only sui generis in jurisprudence, but the ordinary experience and history of human
nature, of men's motives, of men's probity and intelligence,
can teach us nothing by which to judge of Daniel Drawbaugh
"and the cloud of witnesses who corroborate him." Although
the biographies of science are full of instances of great discoveries by men of little or no scholastic discipline and who have
had no contact with scientific men, yet as Drawbaugh was not
a college professor, but a common citizen of Milltown, where
he seldom met learned physicists, he could not by any possibility have invented the telephone.
Although the greatest inventors and discoverers, from the
earliest to the latest, h ave either died in poverty or succeeded
only after long failure to obtair recognition of their discoveries, and year after year have suffered every discouragement
and the greatest distress; although this has been a common
experience even at the most learned and wealthy and enterprising of the world centres; yet, because Drawbaugh, in the
little village of filltown, could not at once command recognition and influence and capital for the new machine whose uses
were unknown, "this story must be a fabrication from beginning to end,' and the learned Circuit Judge.so holds.
And because a community corroborate him, it must be a
population.of knaves or fools. Even the fact that his fertile
mind has produced many other inventions of less note and importance, this very evidence of a mind active in the direction
of invention is turned into testimony that greater discoveries
are beyond his scope.

OCTOBER TERM,

1887

Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

The logical conclusion of all this reasoning must be, and by
the opinion of the learned court is, that Drawbaugh himself
is the malign necessity that demands a new and a special law
of evidence and a reversal of all the commonly received notions
of human nature to fit this case.
If his story be false, he has built a colossal structure of fiction. The lies in it are bricks in a great building for number,
and a flaw in one would bring destruction to the whole.
As the complainants' whole theory and the decision of the
court below rests upon the basis that Drawbaugh is a fraud,
and has had the ingenuity to set up the story and the influence to get it so overwhelmingly corroborated, we submit from
the record a brief sketch ofDaniel DrawbaugA's History, Surroundings and Testimony.
If a charlatan, as he is set down by the court below, unlike
his kind, he has not led an itinerant life. All that can be
told of him from boyhood to age, all the evil or good that is
known of him, all the evidences of character that a man leaves
in the places that have known him, all the impressions which
the course and methods of life of men place upon their environment, exist and are written of Drawbaugh in one place and
upon one community.
The story from his earliest to his latest years is a very simple and homely one. If it be true that he developed into a
Machiavelli in his fifty-third year, the incongruity is worth
consideration from the moral philosophers.
Born in 1827, he has passed his life in the small village of
Eberly's Mills, or Milltown, in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. It is three miles from Harrisburg, and the centre of a
farming community. He attended the common schools part
of five winters, and in his early years was a reader of The
Scientific American, when he could afford to pay his subscription; his scientific library consisted of Comstock's Philosophy,
Youman's Chemistry, and two volumes of Tomlinson's Cyclopoedia, of Useful Arts, together with'a publication on the
International Exhibition of 1851.
Before the spring of 1860 he attended a course of lectures on

TELEPHONE CASES.
Air. Dickinson's Argunent for People's and Overland Cos.

physics by Professor S. B. Ileighes, now Principal of the State
Normal School, and for seven years professor of physical science at the York Collegiate Institute. During his attendance
upon these lectures, we have it from Professor IHeighes that
Drawbaugh was giving attention to electric science, and the
professor remembers distinctly that even at that early time he
had conceived, and talked of, "seaking through a telegraph
wo're by electricity."
The same witness remembers distinctly, and fixes the date
positively between 1871 and 1874, that Drawbaugh showed
him Exhibit "0," and told him that the voice produced "pulsations" upon the machine. It is undisputed that at that early
time he was experimenting with electricity. Complainant&
witness G. W. ileighes says: "He was an enthusiast on the
subject of physics at that early time." He was familiar with
the Everett acoustic telegraph and with the Leon-Scott phonautograph from about 1863. "The subject of electricity
seemed to be his hobby."
He was a person of remarkable ingenuity and skill. At the
age of thirteen he made a rifle for Daniel Balsey, and at a later
period was remarkably skilful in wood-working. At the age
of twelve he made a part of a clock. At the age of sixteen he
manufactured a small steam engine, an automatic machine for
sawing wooden felloes; the last being his own invention. In
1857-1859, he constructed and operated a photographic apparatus, making even the lenes himself. He made for his own
use a solar transit and a machine for wrapping electric wires.
He made his own galvanometers. Of his skill as a workman,
complainants' own witness and his enemies have nothing but
praise. Very few men would venture to offer advice to him,
and he was applied to by others to invent, and did invent
machines for them-the tack machine for Patton; the paperbag machine for Sengiser; and a great many other machines
for the pump company and for the axle company. A number
of his inventions are enumerated in Dfts., vol. 2, pp. 895,
1061, 1062.
"He was a great mechanical genius" (Complts., vol. 2, p.
1550) and "a great inventor." (Id., vol. 1, p. 864.) All the

witnesses concur as to his sobriety, his truthfulness, and his
incessant and tireless industry, and his labors, extending far
into the night.
He was careless of his own interests and generous and kindly
in his nature. His children were sickly and died, and his wife
made constant opposition to his schemes, as tending to take
his attention from providing his family with the necessities of
life.
The story of Mrs. Drawbaugh presents a picture of the man
as he appeared in domestic life, so naturally drawn by this
plain woman, that it carries conviction of its truth in every
particular. He was negligent in money matters, and when he
,had money "he would give away the last cent." She refused
to sign the deed when Drawbaugh wished to sell their little
home, to put money into the talking machine. There is a
vast amount of testimony as to his poverty, in addition to
Mrs. Drawbaugh's, abounding in illustrations, to which we
only briefly refer. [Counsel here cited and referred to a mass
of testimony as to Drawbaugh's financial condition.]
lNotwithstanding the undoubted testimony that his wife
refused to join in utilizing the equity in the property to raise
money to put into the talking machine, it is gravely urged
against Drawbaugh that his story is improbable because he did
not sell the homestead to. raise money to introduce the telephone.' But the court below says, in effect, that the story of
his poverty was a fabrication formulated in the answer. The
answer was "formulated" and fied in January, 1881. The
complainants' witness, Matthews, of whom the learned Judge
speaks most approvingly in the opinion, in his Baltimore American article, in speaking of the impression made upon his mind
by a visit to Drawbaugh in April, 1878, says: "This unlettered
mechanic came very near anticipating Edison and Bell in the
invention of the telephone. _]rothing but Ai]spovertyprevented
hin mefrom conducting his exerim-en& to a successful issue."

And the court below says that Drawbaugh is "dishonest"
in his pretence of poverty.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

Was .Drawbaugk a Charlatan?
The able opinion of the Circuit Judge is exhaustive in its
treatment of Drawbaugh as a conspirator, a perjurer, and a
general fraud.
We have discussed the evidence upon which this theory
rests, with the exception of that on which this charge rests.
It is found in J. C. Nesbit's testimony in "The History of
Cumberland County; Pennisylvania, by Rev. Conway P. Wing,
D.D., and others, 187i9," published by the Herald Printing
Co., of Carlisle, Pa., and containing at page 200 of said publication an article headed "Lower Allen Township, by H. C.
Nesbit."
The court assumed that the biographical sketch was written
by Drawbaugh himself; but it appears distinctly on the defendants' cross-examination of the witness and the production
of the original manuscript, which was under the control of
the complainants, and not by them at first produced, that it
was -inthe writing of Hull. It even left the date of Dratvbaugh's birth blank, which was supplied in the published
article.
Now, the main facts in this biographical sketch are undoubtedly truthful, as is shown by the whole record here. The
florid style of the article, on which alone the charge of charlatanry is based, is evidently that of the provincial newspaper
man, and entirely foreign to Drawbaugh's. It abounds in
terms not possible to Drawbaugh, as shown by his simple
methods of thought and expression in the 332 pages of his
deposition, which conclusively answers this last attempt to
picture his opposite as Daniel Drawbaugh.
We now submit a Brief &Tetc? of the Coneytia.. and
Progress of .Drawbaugh's Telephone.
He himself says he cannot remember the date when he began to study the subject, and that "it was a long while ago."
He had experimented with the vocal organs by placing'his

tions in solid substances, he had learned by noticing the effect
upon the surface of partitions, and by experimenting in the
effects produced by extending a light woodbn bar between
partitions, and then by causing a vibration upon one .partition,
discovering that the bar transmitted the same vibration to the
opposite partition. He pursued the principle always, that the
current must not be broken, and from the first his conception
was of a continuous current.
His idea of pulverized matter is, in this connection, interposed in the current, not breaking it, but causing a greater or
less flow, as the particles form a greater or less resistance to
the passage of the current, as they might be pressed together
with more or less force. He speaks of conversing with medical students at Washington, D.C., about the transmission of
sound as long ago as January, 1861, the date of the visit being
fixed positively by a receipt taken in Washington, and states
that he then had his mind employed on the subject.
Henrr B. Averly testifies that between 1S61 and 1864, and
during the wax, Drawbaugh, in the mill office (Averly's grist
mill), in the ,presence of several witnesses, including the witness, spoke of attaching an instrument to the office in the mill,
by which he could hear all that was going on there without
leaving his house. Averly moved away in 1873, in May, and
has never been to the county since, and Drawbaug moved
out of that house in April, 1868, and never again lived in it
while the witness was a resident of Cumberland County.
In the argument below, counsel for complainants said of
David Stephenson, resident of Harrisburg, that he was a
machinist, and "worked for and with the Faucet Company (of
which Drawbaugh was superintendent), as a maker of patterns, in 1867 and 1868, and that he and Drawbaugh had
many and intimate relations with each other ever since. They
appear to have been partners or jointly engaged in the manufacture of certain pumps. He has been and still is a friend of
Drawbaugh's. Now, here is a machinist and a machine-shop
*man, a keeper of machinist's supplies stores, intimate with
Drawbaugh, having worked for him in his shop - quasi-partners. . . . If there was a telephone there, he must have

.known everything about it; but they did not put him upon
the witness-stand." In the additional proofs taken in the Ovelland case, this gentleman, who is highly spoken of, was put
upon the witness-stand, and he testifies that he did know all
about Drawbaugh's Electric Speaking Telephone; that Drawbaugh showed it to him while Drawbaugh lived in that house
close to the grist-mill, during Drawbaugh's first occupancy of
that house, which occupancy terminated in the spring of 1868.
He shows that Drawbaugh repeatedly experimented with the
instruments, with his assistance. He shows that the instruments
were connected by wires, and that the wire came from the
outside of the building from a porch, and that the wires ran
zig-zag (back and forth) "to give length to the wires," and
that Drawbaugh told him that it was operated by electricity.
He talked through the instrument from one room to another.
Later, in 1874-5, he says : "He sent me to the cellar, and
after giving me a small instrument in my hand, he suggested
that he would go on to the upper floor and speak to me and I
should let him know what he said, and how distinctly I heard
it.

.

.

.

I heard him speaking in short sentences and sing-

ing, and then went up-stairs and met him coming towards me,
and told him what he said. I heard him very clearly, and I
didn't miss any words in repeating what he said, excepting his
singing; I didn't repeat that."
Q. -" How did the sounds, heard through the machine that
day, compare in loudness and distinctness with those which
you heard through the old machine at the shop at the gristmill, as you have testified ?"
A. - "With more force and clearness at that last time."
He is corroborated as to the later dates by his daughter.
We have the testimony of Prof. Samuel B. Heighes as to
Drawbaugh's great interest in physics and particularly in electricity, and of his talking of speaking through an electric wire
by electricity in 1859 and 1860, and witness saw the telephone
there in 1871-4. And we here refer to the testimony of many
other witnesses of a similar character.
The story of Drawbaugh, and of the record, overwhelmingly
corroborated by the witnesses for the defence, is as follows:

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.

Teacup transmitter and receiver, 1866 and 1867.
Tumbler and tin cup and mustard can (" F" and "B "), 1867

Improvement upon "B" (" C "), 1869, 1870.
Further improvement upon " C" and the more perfect magneto instrument "I," 1870, 1871.

"H " August, 1876.,
"J," "K," and "P," 1878.

With the exception of the old teacup transmitter (2 D. p.
7 5 6), representations of all the instruments are in evidence, in

whole or in part; parts of those produced prior to the instrument "I" of 1871 being in evidence, and "I" with all thereafter produced being in evidence in their entirety. The
temporary experimental structures, the changes in parts and
constructions, great and small, in working out the great discovery are not here, and of the thousand and one efforts made
in the progress of the invention there is no memorandum. We
submit it is not to be conceived that any mere memory could
recall them.
Faraday's experiments, which resulted in the discovery of
the induction current, marked an era in electric science, and to
reach it he experimented from 1824 to 1831. He kept a record
of his experiments. Had he not, imagine Faraday at a period
subsequent to his discovery attempting to give from memory
the first and second, and the myriad of other things, and details small and great, the smallest of the greatest results, and
the greatest of the smallest, during these years leading up to
the result. And yet, one of the strongest criticisms of Drawbaugh appearing in the arguments of counsel, and even in the
opinion of'the learned judge at circuit, was that he was unable
to describe all of his first experiments.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

In the series of instruments and drawings produced, the
development from one to the other appears to have been perfectly natural, from the loose, pulverized, low conductor, to
that of the closely confined, so that the pressure might be rendered more easily adjustable; the evolution from the first rude
instrument sketched in Drawbaugh's testimony just referred
to, to the tumbler transmitter "F." In this also is seen the
progress to the wooden cover and mouthpiece upon the diaphragm, in which the membrane diaphragm had given place
to the metal one.
In experimenting with the receiver we find him abandoning
the unnecessary parts in the tin can " B," as from the latter
is evolved the later and more perfect instrument. Upon
using " C ," and finding that it would transmit, though feebly,
using " B" as a receiver, he then places a permanent magnet
against the heel of the electro-magnet and finds a great inprovement, and Exhibit "C" as a transmitter is the result.
In the next improvement in this machine he incloses the
parts, and, of necessity, makes them compact. The experimental magnet is then arranged, and from this comes Exhibit
" I" with its several improvements, until Exhibit "A" is the
result; later "0" and ' I I," still having a large diaphragm,
were observed to give out a false vibration, and then he conceived the idea of dampening.them to prevent the false vibration, by means of an adjustable rubber pad, and then moved
the mouth orifice to one side and applied the- dampened pad
and screw. This not succeeding, he then determined to reduce
it in size, and found the best results. After having made crude
instruments to test and settle the matter, and finding his conclusions verified, he reconstructed the two into two compact
working instruments, 11D" and "1E,"in February, 1875.
From the time of his discovery that the instrument "B," as
improved in "C," would act as a transmitter by application of
the permanent magnet, he had thus far proceeded directly in
the line of improvement of the magneto transmitter, and had
done nothing with the carbon instrument, although he used it
quite commonly in connection with his other experiments. At
this period, in 1875, he turned his attention again to "F," the

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.

carbon transmitting instrument. He experimented, with carbon, and Halsinger saw him baking carbon composition into
cakes. After experimenting with these cakes in the trial tumbler instrument he rearranged them and produced Exhibits
""L"and "N," and combined in them the receiver and transmitter. Then he constructed a pair of transmitters with hard
carbon, without combining the receiving mechanism in the
same instrument, and from this we have "G" and "0."
. In connection with the later instruments there is a piece of
testimony that seems to us conclusive in favor of Drawbaugh,
upon the question of his ability to invent the telephone, and
in favor of our theory of the gradual progress of his experiments from the crude instrument, patentable and a speaking
telephone, to the perfected and nicely adjusted one.
It is a matter of history, as well as in the record, that the
Blake carbon transmitter is in use upon most of the Bell instruments at this time. Blake's sworn statement in the Patent Office, in an interference, shows that he never even conceived the Blake transmitter invention until after July 4, 1878,
and that he never made a Blake transmitter until late in the
fall of 1878. The other side have put in evidence Blake's
patent, which was not granted until long after the date of the
commencement of this suit, so that by law and by the rules of
the Patent Office, Drawbaugh could have got no knowledge
from it. It is further in evidence in complainants' testimony,
that the Blake transmitter instruments were not put into use
until the spring of 1880, and that the telephones in use prior
to that time, were of a form known as the "1Phelps's Snuffbox" instrument, and the "Crown " and "Pony Crown " instruments, so that it is not possible, under any conceivable
.circumstances, that Drawbaugh could have derived any ideas
from the Blake transmitter as early as -fay, 1878. Drawbaugh's perfected carbon instruments " N" and "1J," as shown
by Stees and Johnson, who testify in the most minute, circumstantial and positive manner, corroborating Drawbangh in his
testimony, were taken to the office of William J. Stees, in
Harrisburg, in 1878. They fix the tine -absolutely beyond
doubt, as the 10th day of MLay, 1878, and that the instruments

remained at Stees's office several months. They both identify
the instruments positively, and testify that while they were
at the office they put them on the telephone line and tallied
through them, and that they worked admirably; that they
saw the instrument, Exhibit "5J," and recognize the parts in it
just as shown in the exhibit; and Stees further testifies to the
important fact, that while the instrument "J" was at his
father's office, he took it in his hands to carry it across the
office, in order to change its location, when his father accidentally ran against him, and he dropped the instrument, and
that he discovered at that time that the small, hard carbons
which the instrument contained had become loose and fallen
out.
William J. Stees is the gentleman who, the complainants
show, introduced Drawbaugh to the Western Union Telegraph
office, to look at a telephone, and was accidentally killed at the
very outset of taling defendants' testimony in the case.
Drawxugh was seen by Some of the Witnesses working with
the Earlier.Xachines,after the Perfection of the Instr ments
"1)" and " A" on other earlier .Magneto Instruments. The
Explanation is a simple one.
Some of the witnesses testify to seeing the tumbler "F"
and the tin can "B" as late as 1877. But the fact loses all
force against the defence, when it appears indisputably proved
and is beyond the ability of conspiracy to have fabricated, that
Drawbaugh, on discovering that the magneto receiver "B,'
as improved and organized in the improved "0" in 1870,
would serve as a transmitter, temporarily abandoned the variable resistance transmitters "F" and "B," and did not return
to experiments and progress on them till 1875. -From them,
through a series of experiments and improvements, came finally
the perfect carbon instruments taken to Stees's office in 1878,
above referred to.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

Of the Comment that ]Dawbaugh was still expeerimenting, and
said the ]fachine was not _perfeet, at times when defendants'
evidence shows that he had accomplished the invention, we
say:

Aside from the fact already shown, that he was at work on
the magneto and carbon instruments at different times, there
is a very simple answer which appears incidentally and naturally throughout the record. No effort was made to bring
it out, and it appears in the testimony of witnesses, as in that,
of Drawbaugh, without consciousness on their part or his, that
it was of any special consequence.
It is this: That the instrument in his view "was not loud
enough for practical .purposes" unless it would talk, without
holding to the ear, and convey the sound as far as ordinary
speech. He wanted it to talk out as a man talks.
As George Free puts it of his conversations with Drawbaugh in 1876, 1877, 1878 and 1879: "He told me that he
wanted to accomplish, and could do it, to make a machine
that you could stay in one corner of the room, and putting the
machine in the other corner, and hear as distinctly as putting
it to the ear," and that Drawbaugh told him that he had not
done it yet, but "I am working at it, and I am going to get
it accomplished."
When that journal of civilization, the lSew York Tribune,
thought the only use of the telephone would be for "diplomats and lovers," when the Scientific American summed up
the public opinion of it as "a beautiful scientific toy," when
Gardner G. Hubbard, a telegraph manager and Professor
BelPs financial backer, "did not then believe the transmission
of speech could be made commercially valuable," when all his
friends laughed at him, it cannot be wondered at that Drawbaugh, in the little village of Milltown, years before, should
not have realized that his instrument had reached practical
perfection, when it would talk only by holding the receiver to.

Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

Of the Criticism that Drawbaugh,did not make knowm his
Invention to his Associates in the Shqps where he worked,
we say :
This charge, like many others, has nothing to rest upon.
The Axle Company carried on business at the shop now occupied by Daniel Drawbaugh. It was composed of M. M1.
Grove, Wilson Baer and Captain J. A. Moore. It commenced
on the 23d day of December, 1874, and dissolved on the 29th
day of February, 1876. All three, Baer, Moore and Grove,
testify to their knowledge of the talking machine during the
operations of the company, and as we have seen, Drawbaugh
applied for assistance to all of them.
Of the old Faucet Company, which commenced business in
1867, the secretary and treasurer, Dr. N. B. Musser, is dead;
but it appears by the testimony of 'Prof. Samuel B. Heighes
that Musser was with him at the examination of the talking
machine in May, 1872. Musser was his brother-in-law. W.
R. Gorgas, a bank clerk, now thirty-three years of age, residing at Harrisburg, testifies to the fact that the Faucet
Company was a failure financially; that he left the shop in September, 1869, and took very little interest in the affairs of the
company. He is not called by either party on the point of
knowing anything about the talking machine. He testifies
that he was sick of patent rights through the failure of the
Faucet Company. He remembers that Drawbaugh came to,
him and wanted him to take a half interest in some invention, he forgets what; but as the witness had lost about $4000
in the old company, he "had had a surfeit of it and didn't pay
any attention to it."
John F. Hursh was a member of the old Faucet Company
until 1871, and he testifies that he didn't know of the talking
machines. For the value of his testimony we have no comment to make, save to cite his manner of testifying.
Jacob A. Shettel, a member of the Clock Company, testifies,
and fully and positively corroborates Drawbaugh.
Emanuel A. Gregory, a member of the old Faucet Company,
and his son Joseph, who both worked in the shop, fully and
positively corroborate Drawbaugh.

OCTOBER TERMI,

1887.

Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

John C. Schrader and E. B. Hoff man, and David Stephenson, before referred to, connected with the Faucet Company,
give the strongest possible testimony for the defence.
Tn the Axle Company, the work was largely done by Daniel, If. K. and J. B. Drawbaugh. Daniel Fettrow, John Wolf
and Augustus Kahney, all testify to a perfect familiarity with
the work on the machines and the machines themselves.
Theodore Grisinger (1 Comp., p. 511), a member of the
Clock Company, testifies for the defence. The Clock Company
started in the spring of 1878. He testifies to a conversation
with Drawbaugh in the spring or summer. The tendency of
his testimony is to show that there was no telephone there,
and that Drawbaugh was merely experimenting; inasmuch
as he swears he did not see Exhibits "F" and "B," and
swears that, as a fact, he could not have seen them and forgotten them, while we know that they were there, from the
complainants' testimony, and they are admitted to have been
there in 1876 and 1877, as we have seen, we submit his testimony is of no weight. HIe did see two telephones at some
time, and says that he has seen Exhibit "A " somewhere, and
must have seen it at Drawbaugh's shop.
The other member of the Clock Company is dead.
Jacob Carnes (Comp. 1, p. 883), worked in the machine shop
at Eberly's M[ills for the Drawbaugh Manufacturing Co., from
1868 to 1871, and boarded in Drawbaugh's family. He testifies that he did not see any telephone and never heard that
one had been invented _revious to 1880. He is thoroughly
contradicted by Mrs. Margaret Brenneman (D. Surreb., p. 103),
who lived in the family at the time Jacob Carnes was a
boarder there, and she is corroborated by her mother, :Mary
M. Darr (Id., p. 109), and by John C. Schrader, who boarded
with him, su2ra. Of course, his testimony is absurd, because
it is beyond question, and is admitted on all hands, that all
the telephones were made prior to 1880.
Defendants' Testimony.

of the community at and about Eberly's Mills, of the visitors

period of Drawbaugh's history of his invention of the telephone, and of the various stages in its improvement.
.E'phraim 1?. ffoldinger and his Publiatian of a Card for
Drawbaugh, not including in its List of Inventions the
Talking -Machine.
He was a newspaper man and a job printer and lived at
Eberly's Mills from September 13th, 1873, to November 27th,
1876, but was never there after he moved away, at the latter
date. During this time he was much at Drawbaugh's shop,
and assisted the latter a great deal in experimenting. He
identifies a large number of instruments as having been seen
by him at Drawbaugh's shop, to wit: "A," "B , " "D," "E,"
"F," "I," and testifies that he had helped to experiment with
all of them. I{e describes the experiments at length.
This witness was called by the complainants who proved
by him that he had published a card for Drawbaugh, before
June, 1874, containing a partial list of inventions and not
mentioning the telephone. This card figures in many places
in complainants' brief, and seems to have taken up considerable space in the opinion of the court, and here it is:

We say of it :
(1) It was prepared by lifolsinger, without Drawbaugh's
supervision, and as a sort of return for Drawbaugli's aid to
him in getting him assistance to start a newspaper. It bears
internal evidence of inaccuracy in describing inventions of
Drawbaugh's, notably in its description of the electric clock.
(2) Itp-'urportsonly to give a list of patented inventions. -It
omits the stamp canceller, the siphon pump, the machine for
wrapping wire, the weather indicator, the gas governor, the
automatic boiler feed, all proven by complainants as before
that time. It inaccurately gives as patented some things not
patented; but Rolsinger knew well that the telehone was not.
(3) It purports to give a list of those things likely to.bring
money-earning business from the surrounding neighborhood,
in practical every-day tools among the people where the carct
was issued. The only electrical machine mentioned is referred
to with a special emphasis on its simlicity and the absence
of a battery, thus giving assurance of a practical machine foi
practical uses among the country people.
(4) As a card issued to farmers, milmen, and hOUSeWives
m ]MIto~vn, the advertisement for sale of a double machine
for telephoning would have been absurd.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

(5) It was early in 1874, and Drawbaugh had no telephone
machines ready for sale, and the card purports to advertise
only for sale to the class of people about there, and it omitted
the gas governor and wire wrappers and the stamp canceller,
for the same reason, i.e., such people did not use them.
(6) As Drawbaugh was then experimenting to make it
"talk out," and had not patented it, but was negotiating to
get financial aid in the enterprise, he would not care to advertise to patent pirates the matter of his greatest work, to no
good purpose.
(7) Drawbaugh was said to be a fool and insane at the same
time on account of his devotion to his invention; his labors
had come to be unremunerative, and his object was, as shown
by his moving to Mechanicsville, the next year, to get everyday work, and let the people know he was doing it without
calling marked attention in that community to his "hobby,"
and the subject of adverse criticism, which was notorious,
among the people whose custom he sought by the card.
(8) Holsinger talked through the, to him, perfect, because
finished, machines "D" and "E" (not finished until February,
1875), in the summer of 1875, a year after the card; and the
"Experiments," as he calls them, of 1874, were with the rude
F , "B " and '. ).)
and unclosed machines
Finally.- After this testimony, and after his memory was
refreshed by the card, the witness distinctly and emphatically
states to the complainants that his testimony for defendants,
as just analyzed, is correct, and says his memory is unchanged.
Any one of the foregoing reasons is a more complete explanation of the card, than the assumption that this reputable and
unimpeached citizen and the host of corroborative witnesses are
perjurers, or that Drawbaugh did not advertise the telephone
because he did not have it.
Date&
Of the witnesses, all, with the exception of those where later
dates are given (eight), give their testimony as to having seen
or talked with the machines prior to June 2, 1875, the date of
Bell's invention; and in every case the testimony shows that

OCTOBER TERMI, 1887.
Air. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

the date has been fixed accurately by collateral and convincing
circumstances. To illustrate, the dates are as accurately fixed
in a great majority of instances as in the case of ex-Congressman Haldeman, of Harrisburg. But to corroborate the 11ates
we call a number of witnesses, who testify as to being told of
the machines and of the common report of the machines at the
dates which the foregoing witnesses have fixed as the time they
saw them; and this latter class of witnesses as accurately fix
the dates. There would seem to be no possible collusion here,
as when a witness has testified to a collateral fact, we have in
almost every instance called a stranger to the witness, giving
the direct testimony, to establish the date of such collateral
fact.
To'illustrate the method of fixing these dates, Spafford and
McHenry, and Bricker, were commissioners appointed under
an act of the Pennsj'lvania Legislature, of April 3, 1869. Having filed their report of the complete adjustment in the Court
of Common Pleas of Clinton County, Kovember 1, 1869 -a
certified copy is shown in this record. They never saw each
other after this survey was completed until they met in Harrisburg to testify in this case - Bricker, Spafford, McHenry.
Spafford and McHenry were persons of high standing in the
community, and were personally named in the act of April 3,
1869, as commissioners for this important work. Spafford and
McHenry were never in Milltown, but heard of Drawbaugh's
talking machine from Bricker in October, 1869, while adjusting
the Clinton County line, and it was talked of fully by the
commissioners at the time. Bricker got his information with
regard to it from Henry Drawbaugh at Newville.
Bblye, Brenziger, Goldsmith, Irwin, McGraffic, Stackpole,
John H. Updegraff, Mrs. Fry, Mr. Hake, Mr. Young, Mr.
Strouse, and Mr. Weaver fix the date of Dr. C. E. Updegraff's
visit at May 1, 1875, and the dates are fixed by these witnesses
conclusively by- fixing the time of the visit %ndthe place they
started from in Harrisburg and the details of the visit, through
the records of the Odd Fellows' lodge, of the places they were
boarding in, and by the testimony of fellow-boarders, and of
their talking of the talking machine on their return.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickinson's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

The witnesses for the defence who saw and talked through
the machines, identify them as of dates in harmony with Drawbaugh's testimony as to making them; which, according to the
latter's testimony, in the succession already shown, down to and
including "D" and "E" (which are conceded by the other side
to have been perfected machines), and all prior to March, 1875.
Tke New York and Philadelphia Tests of the Reproduced
Tumbler Instru'ment "F" and the Tin, Can Instrument
" B," and the. -Magneto Itnstruments " C" and "I"
A number of -the original parts of these instruments exist
and axe in evidence, and from the parts and from the testimony
of Drawbaugh and other witnesses describing them, reproduced
instruments were constructed, in order to show the court how
they appeared and acted, when completed in all their parts.
Of the reproductions, "F" was the only one of the four which
was a carbon instrument. It is in evidence that they had been
made some time before the New York tests, and had been very
roughly handled, and their adjustments were in a loose and
shaky condition. It is said that these instruments failed to
operate successfully in the New Ybrk tests, although they all
transmitted words, and even sentences. The court below lays
great stress upon the failure of these instruments to do satisfactory work in these tests. The instruments were again
reproduced and properly adjusted at Philadelphia, and worked
perfectly. It was impossible for the.coinplainants' experts to
find any difference between the reconstructed and adjusted
machines tested at Philadelphia and the description of them
and of their parts and adjustment, as given by Daniel Drawbaugh in his testimony in 1882. It is difficult to see how the
criticism could be justly made that the witnesses who testified
that they talked through these old instruments, as they originally existed, must have falsified, because of any failure of the
New York tests on the reproduced instruments, in the light of
these considerations and in the light of the complainants' own
testimony. In the original case, complainants' expert, Mr.
Pope, testified, agreeing with the defendants' expert, Mr. Benjamin.

OCTOBER TERM,

1887.

Mr. Edmunds's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

It is difficult to see wherein the essential parts of these
machines differ, and it is perfectly plain that the New York
tests failed of perfect action from the rough treatment the
machines had had, and from having been shaken out of adjustment. Complainants' witness, Professor Wright, of Boston,
in his notes of the tests of the instruments used in New York,
states the results as follows: "' F,' reproduced as transmitter;
Drawbaugh talking, Tisdale receiving- heard very well;
understood very well, numerals counted, and conversation."
Whatever instruments were used by complainants' experts,
Pope, Cross and White, in their private tests, were not put in
evidence, and they were unable to say they were reproductions
of the instruments used ai New York and Philadelphia, and
they'never tested the reproductions used by Professor Barker
at Philadelphia.
.1'. George F. Edmunds for the People's Telephone Company, and for the Overland Telephone Company.
The court below was right in its theory in the treatment
of this cause, and that theory was that either this method of
transmitting speech through a wire, and by what are called
electrical contrivances, actually existed at the time that the
defendants' testimony in the court below said that it did, or
the whole of the defendants' testimony is false.
After the utmost inquiry and the utmost contrivance and
ingenuity that could be brought to bear, it was found by the
court below, that these machines, which were said to have
been used and practised by Drawbaugh, were in substance
and fact the same sort of contrivances for transmitting articulate sounds through an iron or copper or any other metallic
wire, as those of IMr. Bell, and therefore, as the court below
held, there was only one way to get rid of this cause below,
and that was to find that the story that was told by Mvi.
Drawbaugh, of himslf and of his work, and the story that
was told by his neighbors and visitors and the great mass and
cloud of witnesses that came from that community, was untrue, and that, so far as this part of the case is concerned, is

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Edmunds's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

all there is to it; and that is exactly what you have got to
do when you study this testimony-what Judge Wallace did.
You must adopt his theory, which I will state a little later
on, and hold that the whole of this thing that was said to
have existed on the face of the earth from 1868 or 1869 down
to 1875 and 1876 and thereafter (I suppose poor Drvawbaugh
had a right to go on with what he had, although Bell had
come on the scene) is a pure fabrication, a pure illusion. I
don't mind about epithets; you can call it illusion, delusion,
fabrication or anything else. The question is whether those
things took place on the surface of the earth at that time. If
they did, then, confessedly, according to the finding of Judge
Wallace below, and according to the arguments of our learned
friends on the other side, if those things took place that were
said to have taken place prior to the date of this patent, as
this testimony tends to show, with whatever of imperfection
this witness or that witness may be found to have been guilty
of, either purposely or otherwise, then Mr. Bell's case as a prior
inventor and as entitled to prevent the use of these machines,
that are said to have been invented by Drawbaugh, has no
place in this court.
It is not the question that you are now to pronounce upon,
whether Mr. Drawbaugh shall have a patent for a particular
thing. It is the question of whether he or those who have
taken up his cause shall have a right to use their instrumentsagainst the intervention that you are called upon to make because Bell is a favored and prior inventor; and therefore it is
-of no consequence whether Drawbaugh has an application for
a patent now pending, or whether he ever made an applicatioh
or thought of making an application for a patent.
The point is whether Mr. Bell is entitled to stand upon the
law of Congress which says that if he is the first and prior
inventor of a useful invention, and has made a proper application in a proper way for its exclusive possession and use, he
shall have it. That is all. So that, what is to become of the
Drawbaugh invention, or the Gray invention, or the whosoever invention as it regards a monopoly to be obtained through
the Patent Office has nothing to do with this case at all.

OCTOBER TERM,

1887.

Mr. Edmunds's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

Now, let us siee if, we can find out, according to the ordinary
and universal principles, and practice and experience of mankind, whether we can believe anything in respect of an alleged
historic event, that is said to have occurred, before fame had
glorified some later discoverer. Let us see what a telephone
is. It is a contrivance for transmitting speech. When the
air is fair, as it is to-day, it is an amazingly good one. You
and I talk to our grocer, or our doctor, or whatever, and it is
extremely convenient. There comes around a sudden change
of weather to-night, and to-morrow morning, I try to talk to
my grocer and my butcher, and I tell him I want lamb, and
he says, "Is it beef you want? " The thing is out of adjustment, and after trying and trying and hearing a roar in your
ear -'iand somewhere in some of these books there is stated
that in these earlier times (supposing it is not all a lie and an
invented lie) that was just the thing that happened in one of
these ancient Drawbaugh contrivances; that one witness who
put his ear to a thing, instead of hearing a voice, heard a roar.
Well, we have all.heard a roar, and are inclined to tear the
thing down and throw it out of the window, and send it down
to whoever is chief of the performance here (and a very good
fellow I believe he is), and ask him to refund our money. The
thing won't go. You are in immeasurable wrath and indignation. But when you come to look at this telephone you find
that, on the whole, it is an extremely useful, an extremely ingenious, an extremely valuable invention; but when you find
it out are you to say pos hoc ergo propter hoc ?
Are you to say that nobody ever did anything of that kind
before, for tho simple reason that somebody who finally got
force enough, with capital behind him, with science as his
handmaid, with the stress and urgency of competition in telegraphy, like the Gold and Stock Board in New York and The
Western Union Telegraph Company, struggling for the ascendancy in the best means of communication, hesitating for
a year or two before they believed the thing was of the least
possible consequence -are you therefore to say that every manwho lived in this neighborhood in Pennsylvania, and that this
old unlettered man, whose life had been pure from beginning
to end, are liars?

TELEPHONE CASES.
Air. Edmunds's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

There is nothing else, in my judgment, in this case, on the
point I am now speaking of, except that we take up what has
at least come to be a famous and accomplished fact, and say
that everybody ought to have known it before, and that if
anybody had known the fact before and could not make anybody else believe in it, it must be a lie. Now I deny that proposition. It is against human experience; it is against human
morals; it is against every principle and test that we apply to
the beidf that we are called upon to express one way or the
other in respect of human testimony.
Now, therefore, I want to ask your Honors, in the brief time
that I have - and I shall not refer in detail to this testimony,
but I wish to ask you to explore and to read this testimony
both of the complainants and of the defendant, in this People's
case and the Overland case, which brings in some later testimony- to read this evidence and see whether you can say as
Judge Wallace did, that one single part of the evidence,
namely, the statement of this poor old inventor himself, is a
fabrication, and that other parts of it, as to events that they
say took place on the earth before this patent of Arr. Bell was
applied for, were pure delusions, and that the testimony of
scores and scores of men and women having no common concert (unless it is brought about afterwards by a conspiracy
that involved every one of them) was a fabrication or a delusion.
If we were to carry ourselves back, if you please, and to try
this case as it might have been tried if the law of Congress
had been a little changed, so that instead of having an appeal
to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on a'refusal
of the Commissioner of Patents to grant a patent, we had an
appeal to this court; if Drawbaugh, sorrowful and sick and
miserable and harried by judgments and creditors and delusions and crazinesses (as some of these witnesses say about this
very thing, which I shall come to presently again) had applied
for a patent before Mr. Bell had appeared on the scene at all,
and the Commissioner of Patents had said, "I won't grant you
this patent, not because of anybody or anything else, Reis, or
a string telephone, or whatever, or a harp of a thousand
strings" -that
my brother on the other side will delight

your Honors' fancies with, if he does not convince your judgment, -" I will not grant you this telephone because it is of
no practical use; it is not a? useful invention. You have got
a toy. You have got a demonstration of what is called a scientific fact. You have got a thing here which, when a person
speaks into one hole, at one place, another person can hear it
at another. Of what consequence is that? No possible consequence to humanity." Just as Orton thought; just as everybody but Pope- who had a vision of the future that none of
the business men, who had money and who had enterprise
and who had ambition and who had competitions, could be
made to think, for a whole twelve months or more, of this
very Bell apparatus, thought. The Commissioner of Patents
says, "I won't grant you this patent." And now we appeal
to this court, and not to the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia; and we come on here with this proof, and we show
to your Honors, by this same set of testimony, and with all
the counter testimony, that there are five per cent of that
whole community, called as witnesses- and I think that is a
fair statement; call it ten per cent if you please, or twenty who say, "We were around Drawbaugh's shop all the time
and never heard of such a thing;" but there is your ninety
per cent or eighty per cent or seventy per cent or sixty per
cent who say, "We saw and heard that thing go." Well,
you say, "It must be proved, upon all human grounds of considering testimony, that that thing did happen - that you
have got a contrivance that will do that thing."
.Now you have got over that point. Now, if you had heard
that testimony pro and con - taking it all, before fame had
lit its lamp and flamed it over this world, could there be a
doubt that you -would say that that thing did exist, and that
Drawbaugh did it? It is impossible to deny it. Then you
would come to the second question: "Well, what of it?"
That is just what these wise and prudent and urgent and
ambitious and learned and critical men said - all but Pope for a whole year after Bell had brought his operation of 1877
to public and commercial view, and was refused, because, although they admitted it would exist and did, exist, yet it was

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Edmunds's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

of no consequence. And it would have been open to question;
and if I were sitting in your place in 1875, when this testimony hadbeen presented on appeal from the Commissioner of
Patents to me, sitting where you are, I am very much afraid
that I should have thought-as I believe you all would have
thought, as Orton thought, and as the Stock Exchange thought
at New York, and as everybody else thought at that period
of time, "We cannot grant this patent, because it is a mere
toy." It is like the gyroscope, which flies in the face of all
natural ideas of gravitation, as we all know. What of it?
Is the gyroscope a useful invention for the practical purposes
of humanity? Everybody knows it is not. It is a very useful and ingenious thing, as illustrating a law, and nobody
knows what that law is to this day; that is an unseen
force or combination of forces that nobody can understand;
that violates all our common sense about the laws of gravitation; and that is, that you put a wheel into motion, and
although it may lean way over there [indicating], and may
weigh five thousand pounds, it won't fall down. Well, what
good is that to mankind in a practical sense? So I say, if we
carry ourselves back, as I think most sincerely we are bound
to do, when we are trying to find out the truth, to see what
we should have said in 1875 if the whole of this evidence had
been presented to us then as to what Drawbaugh had done,
we should have said, "It is plain beyond all possible dispute
that he has done that thing;" and we should have been most
likely to say, sitting on an appeal from the Commissioner of
Patents, "We will not grant you a patent because it is not a
useful invention. It is a mere toy or a mere illustration of
an interesting circumstance in the law of the vibration-of the
atmosphere; but as a useful invention that is to be applied to
the common purposes of mankind (which is the theory of the
patent laws) it has no place here."
Now the question, therefore, is whether this evidence proves,
and proves to a demonstration, and proves more and more by
the circumstance that there is counter evidence, that this witness is mistaken in his date, and that that witness is mistaken
in the identity of the particular instrument that is called to his

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Edmunds's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

attention, proves more, and more from that circumstance, that it is not this conspiracy which involves two hundred or
more people, of all walks of life in this town in Pennsylvania.
And as I think, the key to the whole of it is (the circumstance that I have been so shortly commenting upon) that
at the time when this invention was being carried forward
by this man, nobody believed it was otherwise than the idea
of what is now called a crank. Some people - because
people, differ in their emotions and their sensibilities and
their perceptibilities - said, "It is impossible. I wont go up
and see it," as the Jews did, I believe. When sceptics scoffed
and hooted all they could say in answer was, "These things
we saw, we heard; we saw the sick healed; we saw the eyes
of the blind opened," &c. Nobody believed it. That would
dispose of one class of these witnesses, who said it was impossible. The other. people said, "What of it? What good will

as I say, when Mvir. Bell's final and real patent was obtained
and had got through a year of struggle, the thing discovered,
either by Gray (as I believe) and absorbed, to use a moderate
expression, by some of the occult contrivances of the Patent
Office, without the personal combination of Mr. Bell himself,

does describe a device that will do that thing. That having
been done, it takes a year or more before he aid all his coadjutors, he and they with millions of capital and enterprise and
ambition behind to push it forward, and not an over amount
of scruples before to retard it, can bring it to be believed in
and invested in and operated by the public of the United States
as a useful invention. It turns out to be useful.
Now they tell us that that staggers human experience; if I
substitute Drawbaugh's name for Bell's my learned friends say
it staggers human experience; you cannot do anything of that
kind. If Drawbaugh had done the same thing that Bell had,
in the same time, you would -have believed the whole thing
was a conspiracy and a lie- and that the thing did not exist
now. You would not have believed the evidence of your
senses; yet in Bell's case it -took a year or more to persuade
anybody-people who, with money and with capital and with
ambition and with competition to contest for the best means
of monopolizing the interchange of communication across this
continent and everywhere else, to think it was of the least
possible consequence. Now, may it please your Honors, is not
that a commentary of some weight upon the audacity (and I
use that in its best possible sense) of the gentlemen on the other
side and the learned Judge below, in the treatment of this sub
ject. Judge Wallace was even Wiser than they, under the
impress of his considerations, in finding a means of getting rid
of this proof of what had taken place. I am not now, you
understand, on the question of whether Drawbaugh's contrivances, if they. existed, were the same contrivances as Bell's.
That you will come to understand, if you have not already. I
don't suppose there is any question about that, but no matter
for that. Judge Wallace's only way out, under whatever
intellectual or other impression of this tide-wave of What had
come to be a famous discovery, was this. It was, as he saw,

only refer to it because it is the best possible and the strongest
presentation of any grounds .upon which you can say these
things did not exist and happen as they are related to have
existed and happened - he says: Why, here is a whole community, a well-ordered, respectable, quiet body of people, engaged in every occupation of life that makes up a well-ordered
and respectable community. Out of these, within the circuit
of the geographical limits where an inconspicuous or crazy or
inconsequential, not useful but interesting contrivance had been
discovered, witnesses are called upon, one by one, to state what
they remember. They say with endless iteration, - but not
repetition of the same date and circumstances and event, which
would give some ground to say, "Why, there must have been
a convention to see this thing, or else the whole thing is in
some way a delusion or fabrication," --but week by week and
month by month, as the ordinary events of a social and respectable and well-ordered community made it happen that
one or the other of its members should go to that place, they

hear and speak to a person in a distant room by applying their
mouth to one and their ear to another, as the case might be (I
am not going into the details), and therefore, as they say, they
saw the thing and they heard the voice. How are you going
to disbelieve it? Why, Judge Wallace says that the only way
you can -possibly disbelieve it is to believe that the man - now
I state this strongly; I exaggerate, and logically exaggerate,
merely to show you the absurdity of the proposition - Judge
Wallace says, "You cannot believe anything of that kind, because there was not any such fellow as Drawbaugh; there was.
not any such shop."
Now, as I say, I have exaggerated that; but logically he
says: "I cannot believe all that these people, of unquestioned
respectability, and in every walk of life, say that, they saw
and heard before the great dividing line of fame and no fame
(which is a great dividing line) had been drawn in 1877 or
1878, or whatever the time was; because, if I take Drawbiaugk alone ar.d there had been no other witness in the case,

I should have said, it is absolutely incredible that Drawbaugh
could have done that thing." Now, that is the honest logic,
if your Honors will read that opinion, and the honest statement (although I have paraphrased it) of the judgment of the,
court below; and I repeat that it is the best ground on which
the complainants' case-below and the appellees here
be
put. Now it is, I confess, a little bit new, and I shall speak
of it with reserve and modesty, that a judicial tribunal should
so reason. To illustrate; as in a ease of treason, for instance,
where the Constitution requires that nobody shall be convicted
unless upon the evidence of at least two witnesses, where the
first witness to prove the treason who was vars inter 2artes,
says, "I was a coadjutor in this treason of the respondent,"
and himself tells the story; the Judge charges the jury,
"Why, this man's story, this coadjutor in the treason, this.
accomplice, I should not believe if he told this story alone. I
don't believe he was there, if I took him alone, at all. The
whole of his story standing alone would challenge my disbelief, on his own statement, instead of my belief. Therefore,
gentlemen of the jury, although there are two hundrdd people
who came together, a ba:.d of patriots, rushing to the scene
of the corpus delicti, who swear that they saw this man engaged with the respondent in committing this act of treason,.
they are not to be believed; they are acting under a delusion,
because if I had that fellow alone, I should think he was a
liar and a scamp." Now, what kind of logic is that? What
kind of morals is it? What kind of philosophy is it? What.
kind of persuasion is it to the constitution of the human mind
to believe or disbelieve any evidence? I need not say that it.
is perfectly absurd, and yet I repeat with emphasis and deliberation that that .is the ground, stated ground, upon which
the court below held that the Drawbaugh contrivances, machines, instruments, operations, facts, _iever existed on the
surface of this earth until after - never existed at all, because
nobody contends that these events took place that are described by the witnesses after 1817 and 1878.

become of this cause, which, compared to the infinite meas-

ures of justice, is a small one, great as it is, that your Honors
will not commit'yourselves to any such theory of the weighing of human testimony as that. But that is what it is. I
have not overstated it., Read his opinion. But now let us
see how they treat Drawbaugh alone. Let us suppose now
that this invention was not famous, and that the millions
behind and the millions before, and the great light at night
and the cloud by day to lead us did not exist, and we were to
look at it as a simple fact; what would you believe then?
Suppose it stood on the testimony of this old man alone?
Because I don't mean to leave IMr. Drawbaugh in the category
in which Mr. Justice.Wallace left him.
It has generally been supposed, perhaps erroneously, that
the whole life and conduct of a man, when he gives testimony
about any event that he says he knew about and that he did
himself and that was within the category of human possibilities, and not against a law of nature, - when you would say
he was crazy, insane, and therefore, although perfectly honest,
be considered, and, if his course
not to be believed, -would
of life had been such as to show him, as we are all shown,
whether Judges or gentlemen at the bar, or bystanders or
suitors or whatever, to be honest, he would be believed. Now,
how are you going to tell whether a man is an honest man or
not? How are you going to find that out? All that we can
judge by, as we have not omniscience and do not know the
secret hearts of men, is the life and conversation of the person
in question. If a man is brought on, the stand to testify, of
whose career for, twenty or thirty or forty years, the twelve
men in the jury-box and the three or the five Judges on' the
bench, as the case mauy be, at a nisi prius trial, know without
any proof wyhat his reputation is in the community; that he
has been a gambler; that he has been an immoral man; that
he has been averse to everything that upholds the good order
and morality of the community; in other words, that his
color is bad, without referring to specific instances; if a man
of that kind comes up to testify, and although he may say
something within the ordinary course of human nature, if it
is disputed, you doubt it. That is the law by which you

TELEPHONE CASES.
2Mr. Edmunds's Argumient for People's and Overland Cos.

measure men. Now, take it on the other hand. Suppose,
respecting the same event, a fact that could exist, not a statement that showed that the man must be iiisane, poor fellow;
whose life from his birth to the day of giving his testimony
has been pure; has been upright; has been respected; and
that in the whole forty years that he 'had lived in that community never a shade or a suspicion had touched it; and he
tells you a tale of an event that he himself was the doer of,
and which is within the range of sanity; would you believe
him, although two years, five years, ten years after, a scientist,
glorified by capital and by fame, had said, "I have done that
thing, and therefore* you could not have done it before."
That is a statement of this case as applied to the testimony of
Drawbaugh himself, if you take him alone. And you have
refused to uphold many and many a patent in this court as
you ought, upon testimony more slender than would be the
testimony of this honest old man himself, if it stood alone.
And yet he is surrounded and fortified br scores and scores of
honest and respectable people, whose characters are not impeached any more than his is, who say that they saw and
heard that thing'done before this dividing line, about which
there can be no mistake, between the glorified fame of Bell
and his coadjutors, and what preceded it.
So that I submit, if your Honors please, you are to be governed in reading this testimony. by this test; and. that is the
test to which I appeal; oply read it with all its drawbacks and there are drawbacks which my learned friend on the other
side will present; drawbacks Which I say, according to all
human experience in finding out truth, fortify rather than
diminish the force of the evidence in favor of this invention of
Mr. Drawbaugh. Taking all that in, if you act upon the principles which have been common to intellectual operation for a
thousand years and must always be, if you. seek for the living
truth, as you do, and unless you r~verse all the principles of
finding that have ever guided you before, you cannot fail to
say that it is proved that this old man, in that obscure place,
where the forces of nature are just the same as they are at
Beacon Hill in Boston, that this old man in that obscure place,

did do the thiing that Mr. Bell did, at some time in 1876 or
1877, for this purpose I do not care which.
Something has been said about Gray's having applied for a
telephone patent in 18,16, the same day that Bell did; there is
no claim that Gray stole it from Bell; he, therefore, as all
agree, invented, a telephone cotemporaneously with Bell; so
it was not, after all, impossible that any mind save Bell's
should have made this discovery. But I will not dwell on this
line of argument, because I cannot take up your Honors' time.
What I have said is, to my mind, the key to the whole thing
on the question of priority. Perhaps something ought to be
said for a single moment, about what the court below said in
respect of the intrinsic impossibility of Drawbaugh's having
done this thing. Perhaps it is not necessary, because the
court below was obliged to find (to pursue his own logic) and
refer only to the intrinsic, as he thought, impossibility of
Drawbaugh's being capable of prophesying among prophets,
or of good coming out of ,Nazareth, or whatever, upon the
ground that Drawbaugh was a pure liar; that he was a perjured scoundrel, weak, feeble, but pernicious, to use a phrase
which I hope will not offend this administration, pernicious in
having sold himself to a band of adventurers who are trying
to do exactly what Mr. Bell and his band of adventurers have
been trying to do, and that is to make something out of an
invention; because when you come to the question of adventurers and epithets, of course one invention is just as good as
another, whether it be.a new one or an old one; everybody
goes into it who thinks he can make anything out of it. Now
to fortify his notion, JudgeWallace, feeling evidently that the
ice was a little thin that he stood on, in respect of these
methods of weighing testimony ahd finding out truth that I
have referred to, rather steadied himself as a man on stilts
does with a long pole, to keep from falling over -on the idea
that it is intrinsically impossible that Drawbaugh could have
had puch a conception. Why ? Because it required what is
called scientific training. It required costly and particular
apparatus. It required scholasticism, and a long drawn-out
and drawn-up consequence of study, from step to step, that

TELEPHONE CASES.

should have at least brought him, as the Judge thought M r.
Bell had been brought, to the point where this crowning glory
of discovery would have come. In other words, it was logic;
step by step of a logical proposition; and nobody, therefore,
could discover what was before an unseen force of nature, always existing - how many more there are that are yet to be
discovered, if your Honors please -but not one of them, to
this day, has ever been discovered by such logical steps as
Judge Wallace thought were necessary a man should take
to do. There is Mr. Bell himself, struggling and hoping, as
people do, for the philosopher's stone, exhausting all the
sources year in and year out of a trained and philosophical
and scientific mind, with every adjunct that scholarship and
research and history could give him; and he finds the philosopher's stone, which is to turn everything into gold. He was
struggling and struggling to do something which he could not
reach. How did he get it at last? Accidentally-in the
sense in which I use the word accident. A particular amount
of tension in a particular set of mechanical contrivances happened to be such that, finally, struggling away, they heard a
word; and then for weeks -I
am not now stating th is, you
understand, with precision, to illustrate what I say - they had
heard one sound and there was hope. Now, it was not logic
that did that. It was not logic that led Franklin to put his kite
up in the sky. It was not logic that has led anybody at least
to discover anything. It is not training that does it, although
training is useful; the man is better equipped. The soldier
can fight better who has a multiple discharge gun than the
man with equal courage and bravery who has only an old
musket; but they are both true patriots, and they both have
the same intrinisic force and capacity to do. One has better
implements; that is all. Now, what is the history of this sort
of thing? How many instances there are!. I might take all
the time that is left to our side to tell you, and tell you rightfully, not speaking out of the record -because I believe you
have decided after great consideration, that the court may*be
supposed to have some general knowledge of human events
without its being printed and sent up to you by the clerk.

Suppose you take Columbus to begin with. His instance is
so familiar that it is useless to refer to it. Suppose you take
Arkwright, the great, English inventor of the cotton spinning
machinery; was he a strident, a professor, a teacher, of any
kind df science? Not a bit of it. He was a barber. Suppose
you take Watt, another Englishman, who, I believe, is somewhat famous, and who, perhaps, may be referred to without
violating the proprieties, although his name is not mentioned
in the record. 'What was he about? He, like poor old Drawbaugh, wis engaged in his youth, when he was fourteen, in
inventing an electrical machine; for aught I know it may
have been this electrical machine; because this telephone is
an electrical machine, and nothing else. He was doing that
very thing when he was a mere lad. Where was his scholasticism, his great accumulation of all the scientific knowledge
and facts that had been discovered in natural history in the
centuries before? I can run down, may it please your Honors,
through Fulton, and Whitney, the cotton-gin man; and what
was he? A man skilful in mechanics? No; he was a lawyer
in amnobscure country town in Georgia, living on a plantation,
and I 'believe teaching the children - teaching the children
of some planters, who were great people in those days; and
it was suggested to him what 'a great thing it would be if you
could only find out a way to get rid of the seeds in the cotton
and separate the fibres from the seed. This lawyer invented
the cotton gin. tOp start my brothers on the other side' and'
say, as Judge Wallace said below, "Why, it is utterly impossible. This man was bred to Blackstone and Coke; what does
he know about the method of separating the seeds of cotton
from the fibre?" Suppose somebody in a distant part of the
country, three 'or Tour or five years afterwards, this obscure
thing down there working well, should say, "It is impossible
to believe this' man Whitney who swears, and the men on his
plantation who swear, that they had a cotton gin worling
there for five years before an application was made in Mississippi, by somebody, or in Louisiana, Where a great syndicate
had been gotten up,to exploit a cotton gin that had been

illustrations which demonstrate -and I am ashamed to take
your Honors' time even in referring to it -that the history
of human exTerience from tle beginning of time that we have
any record of, down to this day; from the time, as I believe,
the Bible, or some other good book, tells us that Tubal Cain
invented the art of playing the flute, the first musical instrument, it is said, that ever was made, down to this day -shows
that the correlation between what we call scientific knowledge
and education and the discovery of these important forces of
nature, and their application, has n6 connection whatever;
and that it is more often than otherwise that the obscure
genius whom God made and whom the schools did not make,
and the obscure mechanics, most of whom unhappily have
never got the benefit of their inventions, have been, men who
have brought to the knowledge of mankind most of the things
which we now consider to be the most useful to us. Therefore, I say, without going, as I said, in the time that mast be
left to 'my fellows = without going into the question of the
identity of these machines; without going into the utmost
gravity of that question about what happened between the
time when the application of ALL. Bell as formulated and put
into the hands of Mr. Brown, was filed in the Patent Office,
and on the same day with Mr. Gray's caveat describing what
he would (to and what happened thereafter; and without
going into the questibn of the effect of these claims, in respect
to their validity and scope and so forth, I must say that in
respect of the topic I have called your Honors' attention to,
that it is the end of this case: If your Honors will take this
testimony as to what took place in an honest and respectable
community in Pennsylvania for years and years, year in and
year out, proved by the whole body of the community, of
every calling, in support of this honest old man whose career
is not questioned as a man of purity of life, of uprightness of
character, although poor and sorrowful, there is an end of it.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

.Xr. James JJ Storrow for the American Bell Telephone
Company in reply to the arguments about the Drawbaugh
defence.
The story as told.- Drawbaugh's story and the recollections
of his witnesses, if they are reliable, come up to this : That for
eight years before the Bell patent he had electric speaking
telephones at his machine shop at Eberly's Mills, three miles
from Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, and with them
transmitted speech so well that the common country farmers coming there could and did use them, speak into them, and
understand all that was said; and that this was known to
hundreds of persons, in Harrisburg and all that part of the
country. If that is not true in the fullest sense, then the testimony of himself and his supporting witnesses tells a false story.
Yet it is a part of his history, put into the answer, testified to
by himself, agreed to by every one of his witnesses, that not
one of' his telephones was ever used for any useful purpose
whatever. He never actually took one outside of his workshop
until long after the Bell patent. He never offered a single
one to a human being to use, and not a human being had ever
asked for one to use, when this suit was brought in October,
1880, long after the Bell instriuments had gone into extensive
commercial use. He did not himself, even, apply them to any
useful purpose. They were not arranged so that he could
speak to his workmen from his office, nor call from his shop
to his house. -According to his own story, they were kept in
a box, and all he ever did was to take them out from time to
time and connect thento wires running from one part of his
shop to another merely foqthe purposes of experiment, or to
gratify curiosity. It is thus a part of the case which he asks
the court to believe that these instruments, for eight years
before the Bell patent, were known to hundreds of people, and
were matters of common talk all over his county and in Harrisburg, the capital of a great state; yet it is another part of
his story that this great invention, perfected, they say, in his
shop and thus made known, never led to the use of a telephone
by any human being; though it is also a part of their story

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

that he recognized that the invention was of surpassing interest
and enormous value -sure to bring fame and fortune to its
makers. They say in their answer that nobody had ever
transmitted speech, even up to the time their answer was
filed in January, 1881, "by reason of any information derived
from Drawbaugh," and that all the telephones which had been
used in the world were the result of "independent inventions
by other persons," and were not due to Drawbaugh.
It seemed to us impossible that a practical telephone, successfully operative, could have been known to that community,
within three miles of Harrisburg, for eight years before the
Bell patent, and left no mark. Mr. Bell's feeble instrument at
the Centennial made him instantly famous all over the world.
As soon as he offered his telephones to the public they went
out by the thousands, and all men since have been trying to
infringe his invention. Such an instrument, so easy to make
when once it has been invented, so cheap, so simple, which
everybody could use, so interesting in itself and of such obvious
utility, could not help publishing itself if it existed. It is obvious that this must be so, and the experience of Mr. Bell shows
that it was so. Judicial experience has taught the courts that
there is no better test of the existence of such an invention.
To make out this story, its propounders rely upon absolutely
nothing but the deposition of Drawbaugh himself and the mere
bare recollections of ignorant countrymen, no one of whom had
the least idea even of the lnechanical structure of the instruments which they say they saw, and which none of them
took any interest in. There is not a scrap of paper nor one of
the events which would necessarily arise out of the existence
of such instruments as he says he had, to confirm the story.
Nothing but bare recollections are produced for Drawbaugh.

newspapers a proclamation that they had a vast number of

affidavits to support their claims, and a "cash" capital of five
million dollars, and "within sixty days would drive out all the
telephones in the market, save the one they held, or else compel the Gray, Bell, and Edison lines to pay the new company
a munificent royalty." That was the first time the world at
large had ever heard that Drawbaugh had a telephone, or that
he claimed to be the inventor. The "cash" capital was a,
humbug-there was none. The sixty days was a humbug;
for they were enjoined on their first telephone, and have put
out none since. -Was the rest of their story any better?
They were promptly sued (October 20, 1880), and a preliminary injunction granted. When they came into court, it
appeared from their testimony that they had not used, and
never proposed to use, Drawbaugh telephones. Marx, Wolf,
Loth, and Klemm formed their association before they had
heard of Drawbaugh, intending to use telephones of a form
devised in 1879 by Klemm, one of their number, and those
were the only telephones they had employed. They were early
advised that they plainly infringed the Bell patents, and that
they could not prosper unless they could find not only a telephone, but a "prior inventor." Whereupon a gentleman in
Washington who had been counsel for Drawbaugh sent them
to Harrisburg. They found that a few days before their visit,
Chellis, keeper of a 99-cent store in Harrisburg, and Mr.
Lysander Hill, and Mr. Tacobs, then counsel for Drawbaugh
and Chellis in litigation about a molasses spigot invented
by Drawbaugh and now counsel in this case, had acquired
Drawvbaugh's pretensions by a contract for which they paid
him nothing; so the syndicate bought from them. The only
contribution, therefore, the world has received from Drawbaugh consists in depositions furnished by him to help these
infringers in a career of infringement they had embarked
in before they heard of him.
The story told in their-answer is that' telephones made and
used by Drawbaugh for communicating "between distant
points" in and before the year 1874, are "still in existence,
and capable of successful practical use." All of this is untrue.
"Distant points" dwindles to fifty feet between one part

of his workshop and another as the only use pretended, and
the exhibits produced are so destitute of working parts that
it 'is impossible to transmit any sound with any pair even
alleged to have been made before 1875. To attempt to
transmit any sounds whatever, therefore, with any instruments
like those which he says he had before the close of 1874, "reproductions" must be made; and the essential working parts
for those reproductions cannot be now constructed, nor their
original character learned, except from Drawbaugh's own deposition. For not one of his witnesses knew, or had the intelligence and skill to know, how the instruments were constructed, still less the nature of the operation they performed.
Drawbaugh has taken in ths case about four hundred depositions, and we have taken two hundred, scattered along
through nearly four years of preparation bf the case. The
first testimony was taken, and his exhibits first produced, in
April, 1881. Drawbaugh's own deposition was begun in
December, 1881. The proofs were closed in June, 1884. The
case was decided in favor of the Bell patent at the circuit,
December 4, 1884. All the testimony had been stipulated into
the Overland case, then pending, and as the proofs in that
case were not closed, the Drawbaugh Company took in that
case more testimony about Drawbaugh after the first decision.
That was laid before Judge 'Wallace by consent, and argued
to him in December, 1%85, when he affirmed his former conclusions. Thus, the defendants not only had every opportunity
to take testimony during the progress of the case, but after it
had been decided, by the accident of another case pending,
they were enabled to take more testimony. If proof existed,
they could then have rebutted every conclusion drawn by the
court. That they did not even attempt to do that, except in
two particulars where they broke down in a manner which
destroys the moral character of the defence, is conclusive that
no fact or proof exists which can control that decision.
The Drawbaugh Company have made a show of a large
number of witnesses, but the mere oral testimony alone, considering the character and standing of the witnesses, their
relation to Drawbaugh and their means of knowledge, is much

stronger against Drawbaugh than it is in his favor. KBut such
a case as this does not turn on oral recollections. In Atlantic lVorks v. Brady, 107 T. S. 192, and many other decisions
spread in our brief, the rule has been d down from the time
of Vhitney's cotton gin until now, tnat upon a claim made
late, after a patent has gone into extensive use, when its profits offer a great temptation, when the invention itself is one
which, whenever made, necessarily appeals to the curiosity, to
the desire, to the convenience, to the wants of every one, mere
oral recollections never yet established a case. The court
looks at the probative effect of the man's acts. If the invention
is one which in its nature publishes itself, then, if the marks
of publication are not found; if the invention is one which goes
into use of itself, and marks of use are not found; if it is one
calculated to affect the action of the community, and indelible
marks in the community are not found, -the courts do not believe the story. If they cannot read the telephone in the
events of his life, they will not accept it from his deposition.

The rules of law go further. If the evidence which the
enormous record of this defendant presents does not come up
in quality as Well as in quantity to what his story would
afford if true, the record does not tend to prove that story, but
disproves it. If the testimony taken as a whole substantially
falls short of what the story, if true, would afford, it disproves
the claim. Lord Mansfield said: "Evidence is to be weighed

The lines of proof which arepossible,and which the story if
true must furnish, contrast wi the proof presented by the
clairnwnt.- There is much proof in our favor from the recollection of reliable witnesses. But the Bell Company can rest its
case on Drawbaugh's history and the knowledge of his intimates as proved out of the defendants' own record, chiefly by
his cross-examination, and by unassailed contemporaneous writings. Drawbaugh has not presented a single sketch, letter,
memorandum or piece of paper of any kind to connect his
name with the speaking telephone in any way, until the time
when he was avowedly making improvements on the Bell telephone in 1878, after that instrument had got into extensive
commercial use. From that time on, written and printed
contemporaneous proof of what he was then doing is abundant. If he had had speaking telephones before that, it would
have been equally abundant earlier. The Bell Company, however, have found considerable written and printed contemporaneous evidence directly and specifically showing what Drawbaugh was doing, and what he invented during the ten years
before the Bell patent; and each one of these papers, all
acknowledged by Drawbaugh to have emanated from him, aL-s
specifically inconsistent with his pretensions. Two of them
are lists he published of his inventions, complete and inchoate,
with no telephone among them. Against this, it is on such
bare recollections as have been indicated that he relies to
prove both the fact of a telephone and the date of the fact.
Remains of instruments.- They produce also certain remains of instruments, but all those alleged to have been made
before the Bell patent are so far destroyed that, with the
exception of a pair of magneto instruments, D and E, alleged

to have been made in February and Mfarch, 1875, no sound of
any kind can be transmitted by any seb of them. The structure of the most essential working parts, and the capacity of
all previous instruments, depend solely upon his memory.
Not a single witness ever understood, of had the capacity to
understand what their structure was, and, if they are to be
restored, the restoration -vill depend upon the uncorroborated
and unchecked testimony of Drawbaugh alone.
In the great sewing machine case, tHowe v. Underwood,
1 Fish. Pat. Gas. 160, remains were produced, and from them
the experts testified'that they concluded that the originals
must have contained certain other parts 3vhich no longer
existed, and that from the indications given by the remains
they could reconstruct the machines as Cuvier reconstructed
an extinct animal from a few bones. Judge Sprague replied
that Ouvier's conclusions were based on the rightful assumption that the extinct animal was the perfect work of a perfect
creator; but to assume that about the destroyed machine
was to assume, and not to prove the case.

this screw is faced with a soft rubber cushion, I. These instruments have, however, a radical defect in the manner of
mounting the carbons, which makes them practically poor
instruments. It is precisely the defect (too great rigidity in
the supports, for the rubber does not practically yield) which

alleged to have been made in the summer and fall of 1876,
which, so far as ordinary obsemvation goes, appears to be an

almost exact copy of the well-known and highly organized
Blake transmitter in every detail of form, as well as in all its
principles. This was followed by J, P, etc., none of which,

that 1876 was his high water mark.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrov's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

The later instruments, D and E, G and 0, H=and the subsequent ones are of admirable mechanical construction. He
made them himself. They show that he was a very fastidious
workman, with ample facilities, which indeed he had in his
own workshop. If any of his earlier instruments are riude, it
is not because he lacked skill, materials or facilities for making
good ones.
His story is, that he made his broken tumbler instrument F
and tin can instrument B in 1867. According to his own
witnesses, these were the instruments he habitually showed to
visitors for nine years afterwards, and through which they
say he transmitted perfectly intelligible speech without any
trouble whatever during each of these years. His own testimony is that his rude broken tumbler F was believed by him
to embody this great invention. But he never made another carbon telephone, nor attempted to make another carbon
telephone, nor any other variable resistance telephone until
1876, nine years later. His story further is, that from the
time he first made F, "his whole heart and soul were on the
telephone," and all the time he could spare from supporting
his family was devoted to work on it. That story is not true.
The exhibits themselves disprove it. It is impossible that
such a workman as he is, with his facilities, would have kept
for years, or even for a week, a broken tumbler and a rude
tin paint-pot as his sole embodiment of this wonderful invention, if they embodied it to such an extent as even to promise
success. The fact of the extreme rudeness of these instruments
and all others that he is said to have made down to the time
of the magnetos D and E, - a period of eight years, according
to the dates alleged, -when compared with his skill and facilities as a mechanic, shows that up to the time he made better instruments, (whenever that was) he had not got beyotL
rude and unfruitful experiments which did not encourage him
even to spend a day or two in remaking the instruments in a
workmanlike shape. The remains prove more than that.
They not only show that his enterprise remained in that experimental and unpromising condition (whatever be their date),
but by their paucity and their rudeness they absolutely falsify

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.

all those years he thought of nothing and worked at nothing.
but the speaking telephone. For all the instruments he attributes to that period (1867 to 1876) would not account for
a week's work.
[Mr. Storrow then pointed out a number of details in these
instruments which, he argued, showed that even if the working parts were what Drawbaugh described, still the structure
and arrangement of the machines as a whole were so extremely bad and inconvenient that it was impossible to believe
that a good mechanic like Drawbaugh would have kept a
promising invention in such a shape without at once introducing the obvious modifications necessary to have fitted the
instrUments even for comfortable experimenting.]
Drawbaugh called fifty-one witnesses (and no more) who
professed to have heard speech at his shop before the Bell
patent,' through the exhibits produced.
String tekeyones. - There is abundant proof from statements
contained in questions put by Drawbaugh to one of the complainants' -witnesses and the answers elicited, corroborated by
pregnant circumstances, which slhows explicitly that as early
as 1872 or 1873 the string telephone was seen in use in the
village, at least in the shop of Drawbaugh's brother, across the
street from Drawbaugh's house; while several others of Drawbaugh's own witnesses distinctly and unequivocally state their
recollection that. the instruments they saw at Drawbaugh's
shop, and styled his "talking machines," were-string telephones.
Judge Wallace decided in his opinion upon the first hearing
that it was proved that there were string telephones in the
village and at the shop at that time. Subsequently, Drawbaugh took more testimony in the Overland case, and submitted it to the court a year afterwards; but this later testimony,
instead of attempting to rebut the existence of string telephones, only affirmed it. It must therefore be taken as a settled
fact in the case that, at least as early as 1872, there were string
telephones in the village and at his shop. It is a fact in
the case that at least as, early as 1869 string telephones were
publicly known in this country.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argmunent for American Bell Telephone Co.

Tests of the D)rawbcntgk exldbits.- Drawbaugh had fifty-one
witnesses who swore to speech through his instruments before
Bell's patent. But, evidently doubtful about the value the
court would attach to such witnesses as he produced, he undertook to prove by one expert witness, as an independent proposition, that telephones made as he swore his were made would
to-day transmit speech. He so asserted in terms in the answer
filed, and after the taking of testimony had begun in this case
he made with his own hands, and with the assistance of his
brother, at his OVn shop, what he said were "reproductions"
of his alleged early instruments. ie tested them and afterwards put them in evidence as correct reproductions. He then
called a professional expert who testified that he had tested
these reproductions with Drawbaugh and that they were
"good, practical, operative speaking telephones," while Drawbaugh himself testifies that with the first and most imperfect
of the alieged originals -the tumbler F and the tin can B
-he and the neighboring farmers could without trouble transmit whole sentences, spoken, or read from a newspaper, as
early as 1868, and that each subsequent set of instruments
were better than the first. Believing the instruments, even as
he described them, to be incapable of such results, we challenged his expert to repeat in the presence of witnesses the
tests he said he had made with the "reproduced" or original
instruments. Choosing their own time and place, three days
were occupied in New York, in March, 1882, in testing them,
the defendants selecting a skilled person to speak, and another
skilled person to listen, the Bell company merely insisting that
shorthand writers should take down what was said at one end,
and what the listener thought he heard at the other.
It was specifically proved, and was not denied by any' witness, that the instruments offered and tested by Drawbaugh as
"reproductions" were much better in their details than the
originals of which the remains were produced ever could have
been (according to what remained), even assuming that Drawbaugh's statement was to be taken implicitly for the original
structure of those alleged parts of the originals which do not
exist. It was also mroved that the circumstances under which

OCTOBER TERm, 1887.

the exhibits were tested in New York were vastly more favorable than anything that could have existed at Drawbaugh's.
workshop, where the instruments were said to have been used
by unskilled farmers in the midst of moving machinery. The
result with the alleged reproductions of the alleged early instruments (especially F and B) was, in the language of their
own expert, that all they got was "a sound, and now and then
a word." Sentence after sentence, of from ten to thirty words
each, were spoken into the transmitter and nothing recognized.
With all these aids hardly one word out of a hundred was recognized when the tumbler transmitter F and the tin can receiver B, in the "reproduced" and improved forms, were used.
In fact, when words and irregular numbers were spoken into
that 'nstrument, out of the few words and numbers which the
listener at B thought he recognized, more than half had not
been spoken at all. Later instruments did somewhat better.
But half the witnesses, including Drawbaugh, had sworn to
perfectly intelligible speech through F and B, and the tests
proved this pair, even in the improved form of 1882, and with
the aid of improved conditions, to be absolute failures. The
result of this test was, that if these instruments had existed
at his shop exactly in the form in which Drawbaugh says they
did, not a word could have been heard by his countrymen witnesses under the circmnstances narrated by them. With the
utmost allowance in their favor, the whole story told by him
and his witnesses, of the successful transmission of speech at his
workshop during a series of years, is thus physically proved to
be necessarily and absolutely false. In Ely v. Atonson, .anufackt/ring Co., 4 Fish. Pat. Cas. 79, Judge Sprague, speaking
of the sewing machine case, stated the result of such a test.
He said: "The stubborn fact that Hunt's machine would not
work, and that Howe's would, made the oaths of the witnesses
as inoperative as the mackine."

This result agrees with the conclusions drawn from Drawbaugh's history 'as discovered from his own deposition. Iis
story, as he proffers it, is of admirable speaking telephones
in 1867 or 1868, and nine years subsequent devotion to them,
with no thought of anything else. His witnesses, as a class,

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

swear to that. The fact turns out to be that his present socallcd "reproductions" of what he says were his instruments
show that. if he had them he never could have got any even
seriously encouraging results. The exhibits themselves, by
their rudeness and fewness, show that he never got anything
with them whatever which encouraged him to remake them
in better form, as so skilful a workman would have done;
while the history of his life, shown by his cross-examination,
discloses that the years in question were chiefly occupied with
experimental work of a totally different character, such as
the construction of electric clocks and a large number of othe r
contrivances. It shows that this other experimental work,
which his witnesses do not remember, but which he narrated
on -cross-examination and which is abundantly proved, occupied necessarily so much of his time and attention as to totally
disprove his carefully sworn story of absorption in the telephone. The appearance, therefore, of the exhibits themselves,
the performance of his so-called "reproductions," and the
proved .and admuitted occupations of his life, not only disprove
the existence of successful telephones at his shop, but they
absolutely destroy the picture of his life and work which he
and his witnesses have sworn to, and therefore show them
unworthy of credit. The truth is that they have now transferred to the telephone their memory of work which was
really on these other contrivances.
The opinion filed by Judge Wallace in December, 1884,
insisted very much upon the total failure of these New York
tests. All the Drawbaugh testimony was also part of the
record in the "Overland" case, and as that case did not come
up for argument until a year later, Drawbaugh employed the
interval in taking more testimony to rehabilitate his story.
During that time he made great efforts to construct sone
more so-called ."reproductions," and to find out some way to
make them talk. A new set of instruments were offered as
new "reproductions"; the expert who had made the former
tests was discarded; a new one, entirely ignorant of the case,
was employed; and with these new. so-called "reproductions"
the new expert had not the slightest trouble at Philadelphia,

in February, 1885, in transmitting whole newspaper paragraphs without losing a word.
No attempt whatever was made in the testimony to explain
why his "reproductions" tried in New York in 1882 were
total failures, and his so-called "reproductions" tried at Philadelphia in 1885 were perfect successes. Drawbaugh did not
himself go on the witness stand after his first deposition in
January, 1882, nor permit his former expert to: nor did he
attempt to explain how it was possible that his instruments
of 1867-8 could have talked as perfectly as those of 1885,
and yet never led to any practical use or to a patent.

This second test at Philadelphia was simply a piece of
fraud. His original story'was that the electrical palt of his
tumbler instrument F consisted of a cell or box, E, G, d, (sufficiently illustrated by 0 d C in the illustrative diagram,) not
far from the size of a half-dollar, holding carbon powder, (d in
the tumbler, P in the illustrative diagram,) with a plate or
plunger of metal E resting on th., carbon, and connected by
a rod e with the centre of a diaphragm. The theory is that
as the plunger vibrates up and down under the influence of
sound waves applied to the diaphragm, it will compress the

carbon powder more or less, and thus vary the electrical
current which passes through the powder. It is essential for
this operation that the bottom of the plunger should touch
very lightly on the top of the carbon powder, but should
never part contact from it for an instant. The fatal defect
of such an arrangement (whenever Drawbaugh made it) is
that the up and down vibration of the plunger shakes and
packs down the carbon, so that, if the touch be delicate
enough at the outset, a number of vibrations less than those
needed to make a single syllable (15 to 20) generally pushes
away the powder, and the plunger parts contact with it at the
top of the stroke, and articulation becomes impossible. This
trouble was found in New York, and is practically inseparable
from this contrivance, so arranged.
Some years after the BEhU patent, Henry Hunnings, an
English inventor, exTerimenting with the carbon powder
telephones of Edison and others, found tha' if such a
cell were tipped up so that it was perpendicu-lar, as in this diagram, or at an angle say of 45
degrees, the action of gravity would make the a.P
powder, by its own weight, constantly keep
e
against the vibrating plate or plunger, and there /
would be no break of contract. This effect would

and dry, like the sand in an hour-glass. If it

by tapping it. The Hunnings transmitter, so made, is one of
the most powerful, transmitters known. It is described in his
patent No. 250,2'1, Nov. 29, 1881.
Drawbaugh made his tumbler talk at Philadelphia by putting the Runnings invention inside of it.,
His "reproduced F ' is shown in the cut, with the cell horizontal, as it would be when the tumbler stood on its base. He
testified in terms, that he always so used it. That such was
his chosen position for it is also shown by the fact that in the
New York tests he so used it, placing it on a firm support
where it could not receive the slightest jar. In the New York
test the utmost care was taken to guard it from the slightest

disturbance.

To walk across the room threw it so out of con-

dition that it would not yield a word, and Drawbaugh's expert
declared that this test of it was "a constant struggle for adjustment."
But in Philadelphia the new "reproduced F" was held in
the hand at an angle of 45 degrees. Not the least pains was
taken to hold the instrument still. It was freely moved about,
and the new expert, who had never read the testimony and was
himself imposed upon, ingenuously said that its condition was
improved by tapping it. The powder used at Philadelphia
was granular, while that described by Drawbaugh and that
used at New York (prepared by Drawbaugh himself for that
test) was fine and unctuous like flour. The Hunnings conditions of use were thus provided at Philadelphia. They were
not present, in New York, where Drawbaugh had only his
own knowledge to guide him.
The Hunnings arrangement requires obviously that the
plunger E should fit tightly enough to prevent the powder
from seriously shaling out when tipped up, while in the Drawbaugh form, held horizontally, no fit is needed. In the Philadelphia "reproduced F" of 1885 it did so fit. In the
"reproduced F" of 1881 it did not. The original tumbler
had no cell when produced, and the remains showed that the
cell Drawbaugh described never could have formed part of it.
But whether it did or not, the rude alleged original plates produced are so uneven and irregular in their contour that they
would have let the powder escape in a few moments.

directed, hardly a word ever got through. When tipped as
Hunnings directed, it talked well -just as it did in the Philadelphia tests. This we proved; and they took no evidence to
refute it.
The success of the new tests at Philadelphia, therefore, was
due to the fact that Drawbaugh stole the Hunnings invention
and put it inside his tumbler. Where did he learn it?
The New York tests of the Drawbaugh instruments were
made in March, 1882. The vast significance of their failure
was at once recognized, and was pointed out by our experts.
The defendants took testimony for two years after that, but
they never attempted any more tests, nor introduced any more
testimony to establish the capacity of the so-called "reproductions." The proofs were closed in June, 1884. During the
oral argument before Judge Wallace in October, 1884, and
after our opening argument had exposed the proved incapacity
of these instruments, they offered for the first time to bring into
court and publicly try new "reproductions" and to show that
they would talk perfectly well. That offer was refused on
the ground that it was an attempt to introduce new evidence
during the hearing. Afterwards, in the "Overland" case, at
Philadelphia, in February, 1885, they did produce those new
so-called "reproductions" and tested them. They talked as
the defendants said they would, and we discovered that they
had then in effect concealed the Hunnings invention inside
their tumbler. We found out how it got there. The Hunnings invention belonged to the Bell company, and they had,
in 1882, carried on a long series of experiments with it. After
the time when Drawbaugh closed his testimony in June, 1884,
not attempting to repeat his tests with his alleged "reproductions," and before the time when he offered new "reproductions" before Judge Wallace in October, 1884, and
tried them in Philadelphia in February, 1885, he had hired
from the Bell company's employ one of the men who had
elaborately experimented with the Hunnings invention in the
Bell company's laboratory. That person was proved to have
been one of those who brought the new "reproduced" instruments to the new expert to try. On this testimony, at the

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storro-;w's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

second hearing in November, 1885, Judge Wallace, as matter
of fact, found that the success of the second or Philadelphia
tests had been obtained by concealing the Hunnings invention
inside the Drawbaugh exhibit. This disposes of the character
of the instrument and of the moral character of the case.
Drawbaugh cannot complain of the original reproductions.
He testified that he made them himself in the summer of 1881,
and that he and his experts tried them in December, 1881, before
they were put in evidence. Then he put them in evidence, as
part of his own deposition, and svore to them as true reproductioris in January, 1882. The tests in New York were at
the end of farch, 1882, three months after they were put in
evidence. Liberty was given to him on the record to repair
any accidental injuries that they might have suffered; and he
did so before the tests. iHe never during the subsequent two
years of testimony complained that he could have made better
"reproductions," nor did he offer to present new ones and try
them until after he had hired from the Bell company's laboratory their workman 'Who was familiar with the Hunnings invention.
Ear-ma'ks of copying. - Comparing the modern "Blake

arrangements of the parts, even in immaterial matt--rs, appear
to be the same. But the most important feature in the Blake

element of a notable inertia.' The Drawbaugh instrument
H had the same spring, with the same brass cup on the end
of it,2 and the same bit of carbon held in it in the same way;
but while the two were thus the same, so far as the eye of an
observer could notice, the fact was that the unseen weight inside the cup, which made the soul ,of the invention in the
"Blake," did not exist in the Drawlxugh. It is a case of unI See the description-and cut of the Blake, p. 279, supra.

Another -important feature of the "Blake" consists in a
spring which holds the diaphragm in place, for the purp9se of
getting rid of screw fastenings around the edge of the diaphragm, in order to leave it more free to vibrate. Drawbaugh
has the iron framework to support the diaphragm, and the
spring pressing on the latter, but has clamped the diaphragm
at its edge, and thus the chief purpose and function for which
the spring was introduced by Blake, is excluded by Drawbaugh,
and the Drawbaugh instrument is just as good without it as
with it ;-another feature which proves the whole instrument
to be the result of unintelligent copying and-piracy.
iDrawbaugh's instrument H was not produced in evidence
until 1881, two years and a half after the Blake instrument
had gone into commercial use all over the country.
It is also a significant fact that the order alleged for Drawbaugh's exhibits is an epitome of the order in which the several inventions were published by others. Bell's first instrument was described in the papers as made of a 'tin can and
bladder; such was Drawbaugh's B. His next was the large
horse-shoe magnet instrument; such was Drawbaugh's 0.
Then Bell introduced the short core and coil, the metal diaphragm, and thin air spaces; Draw augh's D and E have
these. The first public notice of a carbon battery transmitter
described it as made with powder. Then Edison and Berliner
used hard carbon contacts; then springs, &c., were added,
until the Blake transmitter was reached. Drawbaugh's F, G,
0, and H repeat this order. In short, all this psychological
proof is that he copied, and the character of his deposition
p.415, infi'a) singularly confirms this. Bare memories of
-dates must overcome all this to make a case for him.
Drawbaugh's own testimony is that while his tumbler F, and
tin can B, were the first ones, he, within a few years after, replaced them by somewhat better instruments, C, I, and having made the better ones, the tumbler and tin can were thrQwn
aside, their bladder diaphragms eaten off by mice and never
restored; and that if he ever showed them to any one after

that, it was as mere wrecks and curiosities, and not as working
instruments. It could not have been otherwise if there be any
truth in his story of progressive improvement. Now it is
abundantly proved by a number of the best of his own witnesses that the tumbler and tin can were exhibited by him, in
working order, and used, at his best instruments at a considerable time after the Bell patent. Such exhibition and use of
them at that time, necessarily, and according to his own story,
disproves the existence at that time of the far better instruments. which according to his pret~nces then existed.
Drawbaugh's ocaupation and the Mistory of his life. We have learned this from his cross-examination, from certain
papers put in on his cross-examination, and from some record
evidence. The story told in his answer and in his direct testimony is, that be made the invention and embodied it in a successful working form as early as 1867, (and large numbers of
his witnesses alleged that it was looked upon as a great invention which would supersede the telegraph and make him
the richest man in the country if he could complete it); but
that it never got into use anywhere outside of his shop. The
failure to get it into use, or to have it patented, or protected by
caveat, is said to be solely because of his abject poverty and
his "utter want" of proper tools and facilities for making telโขephones for use. He recognizes that the fact that the invention never went into use or was patented is fatal, unless explained, and he makes no other attempt to reconcile the fact
and the story. The answer formulated that excuse, and he
and others testified in support of it. His history destroys that
pretence, and his whole story falls with it.
He has been -allhis life a professional inventor and patentee.
.He says that he has made over fifty inventions and patented
a dozen. He never had any trouble in getting his neighbors
to advance the money for experimental and Patent Office expenses. During the very years under inquiry, between the
time when he alleges he first got speech in 1865 and the date
of the Bell patent in 1816, he took out a number of patents,
and his neighbors and friends contributed over $30,000 in actual money, chiefly to exploit certain of his inventions and

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephne Co.

to patent them; and in mall part to exploit the inventions of
others in his shop, under his direction.
In O'Reigy v. -o.ose, 15 How. 62, 111, this court said that
no man could make an invention like the telegraph without
an accurate knowledge of the scientific facts which were to be
employed in it. That is still more true of the telephone. Yet
Drawbaugh's story is that without education, indeed absolutely without that knowledge which is as'necessary as tools
and materials for the originator of these instruments, he made
all the inventions embodied in the magneto telephone, in the
carbon telephone, and in the microphone; that he made the
discoveries of Helmholtz as to "iquality"
of sound, (though indeed his deposition shows that he has not the slightest knOwledge on that subject,) and the discoveries of Faraday about
magneto induction, as well as the 'invention of the speaking
telephone itself. And yet when on the witness -stand he is
asked to 9tate his knowledge of acoustics, all that he knows is
that the pitch of a sound depends upon thb number of .vibrations. What constitutes "quality" or articulation, the very
foundation of the speaking telephone, is something that he
has not the remotest idea of. He further pretends to have
made for himself, independently, some of the most striking
inventions of modern times. He led his neighbors to believe
that he invented Bain's electric clock, the automatic fire alarm,
the Siemens and Halske magneto key, the Casali autograph
telegraph, the Wheatstone alphabet telegraph, the Giffard injector, andother known things. In short, he pretends to be,
and by these false pretences made his neighbors believe that
he was, a genius far beyond any that the world has ever
seen. All this was humbug and deception, and he knew it
was.
Drawbaugh's deposition is a very extraordinary one. The
invention he was to testify to is one which above all others
never'could have been arrived at by accident, but must have
been the result of abstruse scientific reasoning and thought.
Yet his deposition reads like.that of a stranger. Instrument
after instrument, already sworn to by others, (for he was the
last witness called on their testimony in chief,) was put into his

416"'

hand, and he was asked, generally by leading questions, when
he made it. -But from the beginning to the end of his deposition, which occupied thirty-two days, he n6ver but once undertook to make any statement as to the origin or mental
growth of his conception, or as to the principles involved. He
was once asked how he came to employ the principle of variation of pressure in the carbon telephone, which he says was
the first one he made, and he replied that he did not know
whether he discovered that principle, or heard of it from
some one else, or read of it. He testified: "I don't remember
how I came to it; I had been -experimenting in that direction;
don't
I don't remember of getting at it by accident, either -I
remember of reading it; I don't remember of any one telling
me of it; I don't suppose any one told me." Re could not
tell how any idea came to him, and the moment he was
pushed as to the origin of anything, he resorted to the stereotyped answer of Queen Caroline's valet, "I do not remember."
An inventor who had made so absorbing and thoughtful an
invention could not have left out the heart of his story if he
had tried to.
Laying aside the speaking telephone in dispute, it is proved
that every one of these old inventions which he made his neighbors believe originated with him, was well-known and published in the books years before he pretended to have touched
them. He got his chief reputation in his county by producing
an .electric clock, about 1872-5,--as if he were the first who
had ever made one, -for the men to whom he sold the clock
invention testified that they so believed. Just such clocks had
been known for twenty years, and we found in his possession,
and made him produce on cross-examination, an encyclopodia,
published in 1852, with a full description of one, from which
he-had varied only in insignificant details of no importance.
Upon the strength of these alleged inventions, he got his
neighbors to advance their money to. patent his clock, among
other things. His'whole life in his community was that of a
charlatan and impostor, and he made all his neighbors believe
that he was the first inventr of these various contrivances,
as firmly as any of thein pretend to believe that he was the

TELEPHONE CASES.
Air. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

first inventor of the telephone in dispute. So, when the
present people, Chellis and others, asked him to let them
set him up as a prior inventor of the telephone (for he never
made such a claim for himself), their scheme did not startle
him, for he did not realize how much more serious it was
than the pretences which he had often put forward. So he
became, at first a mere tool in their hands, and afterwards
interested enough to work on his neighbors and talk up
his case to make witnesses.
It is proved, chiefly by his own cross-examination and by
some contemporaneous newspaper accounts of his work, that
from 1865 to 1876 he spent more time and money on these
various experimental gimcracks than would have been needed
to have made a hundred telephones if he had known how to
make them, or to patent them if he had had them to patent.
Yet he swears that during all those years he could think of
nothing but the telephone, and his compurgators all testify
that they never saw him at work on anything else. The admitted facts show that that story is, on his part a fabrication,
and on their part either a fabrication or the result of ignorance, stupidity, and forgetfulness, acted upon by his personal
influence, village gossip, and local feeling. In Wood v. Cleveland Rolling .Mills, 4 Fish. Pat. Cas. 550, Swayne, J., said:
"The confidence of the attacking witnesses is often in proportion to the distances in time. Their imagination is wrought
upon by the influences to which their minds are subjected, and
beguiles their memory."
His only excuse for not patenting or making instruments is
his "utter" want of tools and his "miserable poverty"
This
part of his story is a deliberate artifice. About 1865 he devised an alleged improvement in machinery for nail making.
He had no trouble in getting partners to advance him money
to experiment with it, and he took out two.patents in 1865-.
His partners put in several thousand dollars. One of them
was Governor Geary of Pennsylvania, and that partnership
continued at least until Governor Geary died, in 1813. It is
of course impossible that, with Governor Geary for a partner,
this man could have had, for six years, within eight miles of
VOL. cxxVi-27

IOCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

the capital of Pennsylvania, practical speaking telephones
which he was anxious to introduce to the' world and to patent,
and to do which he only wanted fifty dollars. Yet he does
not pretend that he ever brought such an invention to Governor Geary's notice. If he had had them, the governor would
have known of them, and the public history of the telephone
would have then begun.
About 1865-6 he invented an improvement in molasses

faucets and pumps. He had no trouble in getting his neighbors to raise over $20,000 in cash to enable him to experiment
'with that invention, to patent it (November, 1866), to fit up
a machine shop to manufacture the articles, and to make him
their master mechanic, That machine shop, stocked with from
ten to fifteen thousand dollars' worth of tools and machinery,
and run by water power, has been at his disposal, free of rent,
for his own work, from 1867 to the present time.
It has been proved from his own deposition that during the
ten years before the Bell patent he actually received in cash
at different times more than $10,060. as his own money; yet the
truth of his whole story rests on the assertion that he never
could find fifty dollars to get a patent for the telephone, nor
materials with which to make a few for sale. His partners
in this faucet and pump company, which they afterwards (in
1869) turned into a regular corporation under the laws of
Pennsylvania, with a capital of $20,000, and called the " Drawbaugh Manufacturing Company," not only made these faucets
and pumps, but they made several other things that he had
invented, and when they found that their work was slack they
asked him to furnish any other inventions which he had, or
to make some new ones, to enable them to employ their
machinery and capital. They had a number of meetings for
the purpose of examining into the various things he offered
them, and after finding nothing which they thought worth
taking up, they employed him to make some new inventions
for that purpose. This appears from the corporation records,
and his own proofs. This partnership and corporation lasted
six years, until July, 1873. It is a part of his story that
during all this time he had practical talking machines; that

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

he believed the invention to be the most important of his
generation and full of profit for its maker; that all he wanted
was fifty dollars to patent it. Yet it is a proved and conceded
fact that during all that time he never asked his company nor
a single one of his partners to invest any money in the alleged
telephone. He never showed it to any one of them, and not
one of his partners during all those years ever heard of such
an instrument. With the exception of a possible suggestion
about some kind of undefined knowledge in one of them who
is dead, it is not pretended that any of them even heard of it.
More than half of them have been on the witness stand and
have so testified, and the fact that Drawbaugh under these
circumstances did not call the others, his friends and neighbors, is conclusive against him. He does not name them when
asked to specify the persons to whom he applied for aid, and
he does not testify that he ever showed it to any of them.
The same is essentially true of all the workmen. Out of
eighteen or twenty employed there he has found one or two
who say they think they saw a broken tumbler on the bench
in his shop while they worked there, but never tried it; and
that is all.
The fact that an invention of so startling a nature, which
according to his story he described and showed freely to every
one and made the chief work of his life, never was known
to a single one of his partners, and, without any pretence of
exception except such as ip found in the memories of one or
two men, was never known to any of his fellow-workmen,
working in the shop where he pretends he always kept and
tried it, is absolutely conclusive against his story. In the case
of his partners it is not merely a question of memory. They
were men of means, -the poorest of them worth about 830,000,
and the richest about $90,000. They were old personal friends
of his, with sufficient confidence in him to embark their money
on his inventive skill, and to ask him for more inventions
when they had exploited those he had. It is impossible that
he could have had this invention without their knowing -it,
and it is impossible that they could have known it and the
unused.
invention remained unpatented and

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

In 1873 to 1876 he was particularly experimenting with a
telegraphic key, of a kind which he pretended was new, but
which had in fact been known for a dozen years. He made
two of them, costing him more labor and trouble than a dozen
copies of his telephone would have cost him if he had had any
to copy. He carried these telegraph keys to a telegraph
office and got leave to try them, and carried one to Harrisburg and publicly exhibited it, and called in two of his personal friends -the telegraph superintendents of the Pennsylvania and the Northern Central Railroads -to see it, at a time
when he says he had perfect speaking telephones and was
anxious to try them on an actual line. Yet, with this opportunity, he confesses that he never exhibited his telephones nor
sought to try them outside his shop, nor-informed those to
whom he showed his telegraph key that he had such a thing
as a telephone.
The pump and faucet business of his company was bought
out in the summer of 1873 by Hauck Bros. & Co., and David
Hauck, an extremely clever master mechanic, carried on that
business during parts of the next two years in Drawbaugh's
shop, working generally in the same room with Drawbaugh.
In the summer of 1879 Drawbaugh and this David Hauck got
into an interference in the Patent Office, on the subject of
another improvement in molasses faucets. They took testimony, Drawbaugh's financial backer (Mr. Chellis) and counsel
(Mr. Jacobs) being one of his present backers and one of his
present counsel. They conceived that it would be desirable
to prove in that interference that Drawbaugh was a man intellectually capable of making an invention. So they asked David
Hauck and his brother whether, while they worked in Drawbaugh's shop, Drawbaugh was not very friendly with them
and very free in telling them about all his inventions; they
replied that he was. They then asked David Hauck -these
were Drawbaugh's own statements put into the form of questions by his counsel -whether Drawbaugh was not a great
inventor, and David Hauck answered that according to his
knowledge of Drawbaugh he was a copyist and an improver
of details, but not a man who either originated anything or

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

who carried any invention to successful completion. Nettled by this answer, Drawbaugh then interrogated Hauck
seriatim, - Did not Drawbaugh invent the electric clock? &c.,
&c., naming a number of other things, to each of which Hauck
replied that those were old inventions, and all that Drawbaugh
did was to modify the details. Yet during this long examination they never once put to Hauck the question, which would
have been decisive if they 6ould have put it,-Did he not know
that in 1873 and 1874 and 1875, when he worked in Drawbaugh's shop, Drawbaugh had electric speaking telephones
which could be readily talked through? No speaking telephone was alluded to in the list of inventions that Drawbaugh
then recited in his questions to Hauck. Yet this man worked
during the three years before the Bell patent in the very
room where Drawbaugh says he showed his telephones freely
to every one; and Drawbaugh began by proving that he freely
showed all his inventions to Hauck. This interrogation was
in May, 1879.
When Drawbaugh himself testified a few weeks later,
Hauck's counsel asked him in substance whether he was not
a man who simply picked up and attempted to improve other
men's ideas, but carried nothing to completion, and then
pushed him to name everything he had ever done which
resulted in any successful invention. Drawbaugh enumerated
a number of things, but did not name the telephone. The
same questions were put to Drawbaugh's brother, who is one
of the principal witnesses on his behalf in this case; and he,
in like manner, enumerating those things which he thought
would conduce to his brother's glory, did not mention the
telephone.
Here, then, we have Drawbaugh's
solemn written statements, the year before this controversy began, as to the inventions on which he wishes his fame to rest. He made them,
both in his questions to Hauck and in his own answers, and
for the avowed purpose of making the best- show he could.
The telephone is not in his list.
There is also other contemporaneous written evidence of the
same kind. In the summer of 1874, and again in the summer

That was not a list of things "patented," because half of
them were not then and never have been patented. It was
not a list of things that he was making for sale, because he
wras not making more than two or three of them for'sale, and
all the patents that he had taken out were sold. It was not
even a7list of inventions he had completed, for his clock was

then in an inchoate state; he had one experimental working
clock model; but his first finished clock was made in 1877.
It was a list of the devices and inventions, complete or incomplete, on which he chose, in the summer of 1874 and the
summer of 1876, to rest his claim to be an "inventor." He
printed and distributed three hundred of these cards. There
is no speaking telephone in that list. And yet, according to
his story, he then had in his shop telephones perfectly fit for
sale, and as highly refined and as perfect ts those now in use,
made no secret of them but publicly showed them, and believed
them to be the most important invention of his time.
That card has another unpleasant effect on Drawbaugh.
In the faucet interference testimony in 1879 he had qualified
himself as an expert to testify upon a technical question. In
order to so qualify himself he swore that he had acted as
solicitor of patents for others and for himself, preparing specifications and claims for the Patent Office. In a printed billhead, printed for him between June, 1874, and the fall of
1876, he advertised himself as follows:
"Bought of Dan. Drawbaugh, Practical Machinist. Small
Machinery, Patent Office Models, Electric Machines &c. a
specialty."
A man believing himself so qualified as solicitor and model
maker could not have had the speaking telephone for ten
years in his shop, without at least filing a caveat on it or
making a few for sale. Yet the answer said that he was
absolutely unable to do even that, - and he must swear that
he was. So, on his direct examination in this case, he testified that he was not a patent solicitor, and that he always
knew that he was quite incapable qf drawing a specification,
though he admitted that he had done so in some cases. Afterwards, we found this card, by which he advertised himself as
such. We introduced it by the deposition of the printer,
one of his personal friends and witnesses. Drawbaugh never
dared to go on the witness stand again, and no attempt was
made to explain it by any witness. His whole testim6ny
on that behalf, like the testimony about his poverty, was
designedly introduced to meet what he knew was the turning
point of his case.

.OCTOBER TERM, 1887
31r. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

An important part of this and other evidence -the production by him of a copy of the Patent Office rules, &c., was
the proof it afforded of his familiarity with patents ;- that
he was familiar with the'road to the Patent Office, and knew
the importance of going there.
Between 1872 and 1876, two of his friends in Harrisburg
were Mr. Kiefer, superintendent at Harrisburg of the telegraphs of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and Mr. Simon Cameron Wilson, then superintendent of the telegraphs of the
Northern, Central Railroad, and, at the time this case was
tried, mayor of Harrisburg. Mr. Kiefer was also a member
of a large electrical manufacturing firm-Hahl, Kiefer &Co.
makers, among other things, of the signal service instruments
for the Government. Drawbaugh during these years was in
the habit of going to these two telegraph superintendents, obtaining small supplies of cast-off magnets, battery-plates, &c.,
from their condemned instruments, talking with them about
his electrical experiments, and carrying to Harrisburg various
electrical contrivances, such as his clock and his telegraph
key, to show them. They were men who would have instantly taken his telephone and tried it if he had had any,
and Mr. Kiefer testifies that he would have liked nothing
better than to have patented and manufactured such things at
his firm's factory. Yet during all those years Drawbaugh
never showed them a telephone, and never hinted that he had
ever thought of such a thing. These two gentlemen so testify
in terms. Drawbaugh does not deny it. When asked to
whom he applied for assistance about his telephone, he does
not name them. This proof, again, does not rest on memory.
If in 1873 or 1874 he bad carried a speaking telephone to one
of those men, the public history of the art would have begun
that day, and not waited until MAr. Bell's appearance in 1876.
Another of his intimate friends was Mr. Theophilus Weaver,
a patent solicitor of Harrisburg, himself an inventor. It is in
evidence, and not contradicted, that Drawbaugh was in the
habit of going to him from 1869 onward;. that they had some
business together; that some clients of Mr. Weaver's carried
on business at Drawbaugh's shop, with Drawbaugh as superin-

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

tendent, in 1875-6, and that Weaver had been there a number
of times from 1867 to 1876. Yet Weaver testifies, without
contradiction, that Dra-baugh, now pretending to be only too
anxious to get hib telephone patented, never spoke of the subject to Weaver, and Weaver never heard that Drawbaugh had
a telephone until 1878, when Bell's telephones were in extensive commercial use and were in actual use in Harrisburg.
Drawbaugh then said to Weaver, in May, 1878, that he had
turned his attention somewhat to the subject a good many
years back, but never got any results, and did not expect
speech, but only musical tones, and had nothing to show for
what he had done. These facts do not rest merely on Weaver's
memory, though Drawbaugh does not contradict him. If
Weaver, a patent solicitor, had known of a telephone in 1873,
it would have been instantly patented.
Drawbaugh's relations in the community were such that if
he had had a speaking telephone it would have been mentioned
in the newspapers. He was known as an ingenious inventor
of small things, and in that community attracted attention.
He exhibited at the state fair in 1868 and 1869, and his exhibition (nail machinery and pumps) was mentioned in the newspapers. His witness Holsinger, at one time editor of a country
newspaper, who says that in 1873-4-5-6 he was Drawbaugh's
most intimate friend, next door neighbor and co-experimenter
with the telephone, wrote some newspaper articles about Drawbaugh's inventions in 1875, and again in 1876. He mentioned
his clock and praised it, and said that Drawbaugh was going
to make one to exhibit at the Centennial; but never wrote a
word about a telephone. It is proved by that article and
otherwise, that Drawbaugh did contemplate exhibiting at the
Centennial, but that what he proposed to do was to build an
electric clock for that purpose; although he wants the court
to believe that he then had in his shop speaking telephones as
good as those now in use, and that he made no secret of them
and was anxious to attract public attention to them.
In 1878 he was visited by a number of newspaper writers,
attracted by his electric clock, which during that spring was
publicly exhibited for money in Harrisburg and some other

OCTOBER TERI, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

towns. In that spring he became spoken of as, a person
connected with telephones; but in this way: Several para.
graphs appeared saying that he was "then" inventing improvements in telephones, but not one of them attributed to him the
original invention. It is not possible that the local newspaper
writers could have visited him and got any inkling from him
that he was the originator of that wonderful instrument without spreading his story at full length instantly in the papers.
Among other visitors, .Mr. .3fatthews, an editor of the Balamore American, went to his shop in April, 1878, to see his
clock, and while there talked to him about the telephone,
which was then attracting great attention. Drawbaugh's
statement to Mr. Matthews was that he had experimented
-somewhat upon a telephone many years before Bell or Edison, but that he never got speech and never expected to;
that his aim was to send telegraph messages by variations of
tone and pitch. Mr. Matthews published this in his newspaper in 1878, and sent a copy to Drawbaugh, who never
repudiated it. Mr. Matthews came upon the witness stand
and repeated under oath his account of the visit. The article,
after describing the clock at considerable length, and in a very
laudatory manner, said of Drawbaugh's attempts about a telephone: " He never expected to send articulate sounds over a
magnetized wire, but he believed that an alphabet could be
arranged after the manner of a musical scale, and that messages could be transmitted and understood by the variations
of tone and pitch."
That such was Drawbaugh's purpose is curiously confirmed.
It is proved as matter of fact in these cases that between 1860
and 1870 many persons were trying to construct telegraphs
which should send ordinary telegraph messages by variations
of tone and pitch, and that Drawbaugh knew of these attempts
and was much interested in them. One of the most ingenious
and extraordinary of these "1phonic telegraphs," as they were
often called, was described in the &ienthic American in 1863.
Drawbaugh got that paper, studied that description, thought
a great deal of it, remembered it and some others on the witness stand, and finally produced the paper, which he had kept.

TELEPHONE CASES.

Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

In the same spring as Mr. Matthews' visit- 1878 - a friend
of his, -Jfh. Stees, a manufacturer at Harrisburg, now dead,
took him to the telephone office in Harrisburg, introduced
him, and said to the telephone people there that Drawbaugh
was then engaged in making a telephone which he thought
would be better than theirs, but never hinted that Drawbaugh
was the originator of that great invention. Mr. Stees for
many years had a private telegraph line connecting his office
with one of his machine shops. He found such difficulty in'
working Morse instruments that he was the first man in Harrisburg to put in the Bell telephone, in March, 1878. Drawbaugh and he were intimate friends, and they had been partners in a little invention of IDrawbaugh's ten or fifteen years
before. Yet Drawbaugh does not pretend that he ever
showed his telephones to Stees, or asked to try them on a line,
or asked ahny aid from Stees until after Stees had the Bell telephone in use in 1878.

Drawbaugh called again at the telephone office a few days

the country. Yet he never gave a hint of it. He borrowed
a magneto telephone of an ingenious but rather inferior kind
from the telephone company (the. Phelps "Crown "), with
curled magnets, and took it to his shop to study it and learn
how it was made. He kept it several weeks. Yet, if his story
be true, he had had for two years almost exactly that instrument (in L and Al, the magnets of which were bent), and
during all that time he also, according to his story, had telephones- the Blake transmitter H, and other microphones which were so far ahead of it that it would have been thrown
away the moment such instruments appeared.
In the fall of 1878, a history of Cumberland County, where
he lived, was published. He subscribed $10 to it on condition
that they would publish a biography of himself. He furnished
the biography, and it was published essentially as he sent it.
In it he enumerates a number of his inventions, and at the end
of his enumeration, nowhere stating himself to be the originator of the telephone, he says that he has invented "several
kinds" of telephones. Improvers are so spoken of; the originator never could so speak of himself. This vain-glorious
autobiographist could not have failed to claim for himself
what in 1878 was recognized as the greatest invention of our
generation, if he had made it. This article was so printed,
the book taken to him, this shown to him, and he, acquiescing
in its correctness, paid his subscription.
These newspaper accounts - and there are a number of
them in the first half of 1878-speak of him repeatedly as
then engaged in improving the telephone. That is a fact
which his story must square with. Stees s6 informed the telephone company, in,Drawbaugh's presence, in 1878. Yet, if the
story of his deposition be true, he had at least a year before
that completed the best telephones he ever made, and never,
since the spring of 1877 down to the time when this suit began, constructed anything which was, or which according to
his own account he thought was, an improvement on his alleged old ones of 1876.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

The truth is that he made his telephones after the Bell patent came out. He at first copied what he had seen described
in the cientito American in Seltember, 1876, as Bell's tin
can instrument. It is in proof that he exhibited this to a number of persons in the fall of 1876 as the best thing he had. In
the beginning of 1878, when telephones were attracting a
great deal of attention in the community, and the microphone
had become known but was not perfected enough for commercial use, he, like many others, seriously went to work to try
and make modifications and improvements. That was his real
work on the telephone, and we believe it was then that he did
it, and made his first attempt at a carbon telephone. The contemporaneous newspapers and Stees' statement prove this part
,of his hiftory.
l/oyd and Worley, two school teachers of :Harrisburg, had
long known him well, but had heard nothing about telephones.
At the beginning of February, 1878, they went to see his
clock, and presently published a very laudatory newspaper artiโขcle about it. He told them that he had made telephones (not
pretending that he had made them before Bell), but that the
articulation was bad, and he was trying to improve it by giving a confined shape to the sound chamber. Plainly, he was
then making D and E, his first telephones with the thin air
-chamber and other refinements which Bell patented and put
into commercial use in 1877; for Drawbaugh never made any
change in the sound chamber after D and E.
The mere fact, conclusively established, that at that time he
was making improvements, is absolutely inconsistent with the
story of himself and his witnesses that his most improved telephones were made some years before. On the other hand, it
perfectly fits in with the fact that his work before that was in
experiments on other contrivances, that no telephone was
known to David Hauck or any of his partners, that no telephone was found in his advertising cards of 1874 and 1876,
and that no telephones were shown to the telegraph superintendents Kiefer and Wilson.
His shop was full of electrical contrivances for many years.
He undoubtedly had there as early as 1872 or 1873 string tel-

ephones. He had there in 1872 or 1873 modified. telegraph
instruments, such as the magneto key, and the alphabet instrument which would" spell out words, and which he said were to
supersede the existing telegraph instruments. His witnesses,
many of them of exceptional stupidity, who undoubtedly saw
electric speaking telephones at his shop in 1876-8, have mixed
these things together, and, aided by their desire to help a
friend, by his subtle insinuations of ideas into their heads, and
by the gossip of the village grocery and c6bbler's shop during
the preparation of this case, have come to a condition of mind
where they attribute to one time what they saw at another,
in a shop full of contrivances all equally wonderful, and all
equally incomprehensible to them.
Drawbaug,'s witnesses and t1keir value. -His
case rests
purely on oral recollections. Its whole strength lies in the fact
that he has fifty-one such witnesses who testify that' before the
Bell patent they heard speech at his shop, through what they
say they understood were electric speaking telephones.
Two questions lie at the foundation of this case. One is,
what is the value of the mere oral recollections of the interested parties and their friends, of such a class, against the history of this man's life ? and another is, what is the relative
strength of the purely oral testimony on the two sides? for on
Drawbaugh's side there is nothing else. We believe that the
panswer to each of these questions is against him.
Whefil we first heard of the Drawbaugh claim and began
to study the subject on the spot, we found that fair inquiry
was impossible. The country people saw on one side a corporation of strangers; on the other, a neighbor wrhose success
was a matter of local pride, and promised to bring into that
little community, and into the pockets of an' open-handed man,
more money than the villagers had ever dreamed of. More
potent than all was the intense local feeling of a narrow and
rural community which made every member of it a partisan of
one side and an enemy of the other. But this was not all.
The Drawbaugh Company had diligently cultivated the ground,
and had taken seventy-five exoparte affidavits, but not for use
in any proceedings. They were simply anchors planted around

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

to hold that community. The great case was the theme of
gossip in the country grocery and cross-roads shoeshop, till
the most ignorant were ashamed not to remember, and vied
with each other in their stories. So we found, during the four
years of taking testimony, that witnesses who remembered
nothing in the first year, swore the most glibly for him in the
last.
At the outset, we had to consider what classes of persons
would be the crucial witnesses in such a ease. The claimant
had had nine partners and 'twenty-five workmen during the
time in question. He had a number of close and intimate
friends, near neighbors, men of substantial means, disposed to
invest money in his inventions. He was in the habit of going
to the two telegraph superintendents and other skilled and
intelligent persons in Harrisburg and Mechanicsburg, and
showing them his inventions. If his story be true, it is
absolutely certain that to all those men the telephone would
have been like a household word, and they would have been
continually solicited to aid him in patenting, &c., if aid was
needed,- for he was a professional inventor and patentee and
says he always wanted to patent this invention. If the fact
were clearly established that those men did not know of the
invention, it would be certain that it did not exist. With that
fact once established, the dim and strained recollections of the
small farmers and farm laborers, testifying about an instrument they neither understood nor took interest in, their minds
confused by the large number of contrivances they saw in his
shop and the number of times they saw them,, are of no value
upon the question whether one particular unknown thing they
saw was a speaking telephone, or at what period of their constant visits they saw it.
In this inquiry we were thoroughly successful. Indeed, the
history of the case did not leave it in doubt; for most of these
men were in such circumstances and of such disposition, shown
by the aid they gave him about other inventions, that if they
had known of a speaking telephone at his shop, the public history of the art would have begun at that instant. But the
proof is even more specific. Drawbaugh's cross-examination

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

and some other undisputed proofs developed tae. names of'
about seventy-five persons so situated. He was repeatedly
asked whom he had applied to for aid, and what exhibitions
of his instruments he had made; and no one of these men
were named by him. Out of all these seventy-five men, only
two or three (they were workmen employed about 1870)
were called by the defendants to even pretend to any recollection about his instruments.
Others were put on the
stand for collateral matters, but not asked about telephones.
Then we went to them, found in almost every case (including
the case of the two telegraph superintendents) that Drawbaugh had applied to them before we had, and they had no
recollection of any such machine until after the summer of
1876. We called a substantial number of them -enough
to
establish the proposition. That, under these circumstances,
Drawbaugh, on whom the burden lay, and whose friends they
were, did not call the others, is conclusive.
. Against these stubborn facts the Drawbaugh party labored
for four years, and called 406 witnesses, mostly for collateral
-and remote matters, but the crucial witnesses did not come.
With all, this scouring of the country, they could find only
fifty-one person who would pretend to fancy that they had
heard speech during the ten years with anything which they
โขcould suppose to be the telephones he described -five a year'
-a
number absurdly below what the story, if true, would
have furnished. But hardly one of these was above the grade
of a common farm laborer.
It is only the mere residuum of such conflicting oral
testimony, if there be any residuum, which is to be set
against the facts of his history, against his advertising
card, against his own deposition and his questions to Hauck
in the interference testimony in the summer of 1879, against
the fact that all his partners and friends who would have
advanced money for the telephone, if he had had one, never
heard of it, against the fact that with one or possibly two
exceptions no man of intelligence even pretends to have heard
speech before the Bell patent. Besides that, an examination
of the depositions themselves shows that they are thoroughly

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for Armerican Bell Telephone Co.

worthless, and that plainly a considerable number of them
are the result of deliberate contrivance and conspiracy on
Drawbaugh's part.
We begin with the fact that of these fifty-one witnesses
more than half swear to thoroughly good speech through the
tumbler F and tin can B. We know now from the New York
tests that that is absolutely impossible. Several other witnesses swear that with a pair of magneto telephones, and
several others swear that with instruments they cannot identify or describe, they heard perfectly good speech when the
receiver was lying on the table, and they were several feet
distant from it; or that they heard perfectly good speech
without any trouble in the midst of the noise of the machinery
of the shop. The best magneto telephones to-day, or the best
instruments Drawbaugh pretends he had, cannot do anything
of the sort. It is absolutely impossible. Moreover, the picture
they give of his life for the ten years before the Bell patenthis "abject" poverty, his exclusive devotion to the telephone,
that he worked on nothing else - we know is false. All this
destroys an argument which rests on the assumption that
what a large number of such witnesses say must be true.
We know that what more than half of them swore to specifically about the telephone is false, and that their whole
picture of his life gives nothing but false color. The circuit
judge found that they were ignorant men who had been
practised upon by Drawbaugh and first made to believe his
story, and afterwards produced to swear to it. He declined
to substitute their credulity for his own judgment.
Some specific instances are very instructive.
Hen'y Baykr, who appears on the surface to be one of the
best half dozen of their witnesses, was one of the proprietors
of a neighboring saw-mill and planing-mill from the spring of
1873 until the summer of 187[. He and Drawbaugh had
dealings together, and Drawbaugh did repairs at the mill.
Bayler says that at some time he went to Drawbaugh's shop
and heard perfectly good speech through the tumbler F and
tin can B. We know that is impossible. He says that it was
when Drawbaugh was first repairing his saw-mill engine,

which was fixed to be in June, 1873. His association of dates
is hardly more than arbitrary; and if the occurrence; whatever
it was,-was not then, there is no way of fixing it any time*
short of the summer of 187[, when Bayler moved away. It
certainly was not during the year named nor during the next,
year. For the partitions in the upper story of Drawbaugh's
shop, where he says his telephones were usually kept and used,
were changed from time to time, and we know from Drawbaugh's own testimony and the testimony of the different.
partnerships which occupied that shop and paid for the.
changes in the partitions, just when each change took place.

poverty. He puts his visit as at the end of June, 1873.
He says that Drawbaugh importuned him to advance a littlei
money to take a patent, and said that it was absolutely
impossible for him to find any, and that if he could find
money enough for a patent, his fortune would be made.
He professes to have known that Drawbaugh was abjectly
poor at that time. The truth is, as is shown by the books.
of the faucet company, produced by Drawbaugh, that at
that time the company had just sold all its property foi
cash, and within two weeks from that time Drawbaugh received from that sale a dividend of $450 in actual cash, (July
15, 1873,) and had so little pressing call for the money that he
used $300 of it to pay off the last instalment of the bottom
mortgage on his own house; for he owned a double house at
that time, and had for six years, with an old incumbrance of
$300 on it. He lived in one half of this house, and rented theother half for $110 a year to a good paying tenant.
Bayler says that Drawbaugh's poverty was such that when
he made-repairs at the gaw-mill he always required to be paid in

cash at once; and that when he bought lumber from the sawmill he always insisted that it should stand on credit; and
when they settled their account finally he owed the saw-mill
about $70, which they had to sue for and establish a lien for,
in order to collect. Drawbaugh put Bayler on the stand to
swear to that story. Yet the truth is that the saw-mill people
never paid Drawbaugh a dollar of cash; that he got lumber
from time to time only against his credit for work already
done; that there never was a time during all these years when
the saw-mill people did not owe him on settlement of account
from $30 to :,60 which he could have had by asking for it;
and that at the very time alleged for this visit they owed him
$50, sufficient to take out a patent, and he never asked them
for it. These facts we afterwards proved 1 - the production
of Drawbaugh's accounts in his own handwriting, and by the
saw-mill people's books, and they were not disputed. Moreover, the settlement of account had involved a suit between
Drawbaugh and the saw-mill people, and in that suit Drawbaugh filed his own affidavit, stating this condition of the accounts, and showing that the last lumber he took from them
($70, in 1877) was intended to balance this account, and if it
overran it, it was only about $10 or $15, which he was ready to
pay. This affidavit, which we put into the case, was sworn to
by Drawbaugh only fifteen months before he put Bayler on
the stand to testify to the story which he knew was false.
Jacob Reneker says that at one tine Drawbaugh was so
poor that he sold to Reneker a part of his household furniture
- a secretary and bedstead- to pay for provisions for his
family. Drawbaugh on the witness stand repeats this story
very pathetically. The fact is that at the time in question
Drawbaugh was moving from one house to another: his
household effects made eighteen horse-loads; he had more
furniture than his family needed or than his new house could
hold; among other things he had two secretaries (he had
made one himself, and had afterwards bought a better one),
and, in moving, he sent his old secretary and some bedsteads
to his workshop as suporfluities, varnished them up, and sold
them to Reneker.

Urias R. 2ickols testified that he had been in the signal
service and assistant keeper of a lighthouse, and appeared to.
be an intelligent witness. He said that he went to Drawbaugh's shop and saw the tumbler F, and tin can B, and the
wooden instrument A; that Drawbaugh said the wooden
instrument was about two months old, and the tumbler and
can three or four years old; and they talked through them.
He testified that this was in January, 1875, and he fixed the
date by saying that on the day of this his only visit to Drawbaugh's shop he bpught some lime at a particular lime-kiln
which he specified, and that a memorandum, which he said he
had at home but forgot to bring and never produced, stated
that the lime was delivered January 18, 1875. On crossexanination, he said that he went to the shop particularly to
see Drawbaugh's electric clock, in consequence of having read
an account of it in a newspaper, which he repeated. We
found the newspaper with that account in it, and instead of
being January, 1875, it was February, 1878, two years after
the Bell patent. We produced the man who kept the limekiln up to April, 1876, the time of the Bell patent, with his
books, and he proved that Nichols never bought any lime of
him. Nichols testified on cross-examination that during the
same season as this visit to Drawbaugh's shop he stated the
occurrence to Colonel Maish, a lawyer in York, and a member
of Congress. Colonel Mfaish, called as a witness by us, remembered the statement perfectly well, and knew Drawbaugh as
one of his constituents; but he also remembered that when
Nichols told him of it, the telephone was not new to him,
because he had talked through a Bell telephone in Washington. The telephone he talked through we proved was put
upby one of Mr. Bell's agents in the fall of 1877. Nichols
never came back to explain his story, and there was no
attempt to reinstate it. Yet he appeared to be one of their
best witnesses.
But what becomes of Drawbaugh who puts a witness on
the stand to detail an interview between them and to swear
that at the +-me of the visit the telephone A was two months
old, and that the first telephone with the tumbler and tin can

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

was then a few years old, when it turns out that this visit was
t.vo years after the Bell patent? Either the whole occurrence
is concocted, or it is fatal to his dates.
Samuel Nichols, another witness, says that he went to
Drawbaugh's shop, listened to the tumbler and tin can, and
heard two words, and his "son-in-law Bruce" was with him,
and alsb heard two or three words. He thought the visit was
in 1869. It turned out that Bruce did not become his son-inlaw until June, 1876, four months after the Bell patent, and
did not become acquainted with his family until after Bruce's
first wife had died in 1875. Nichols' son, Edward Nichols,
worked in Drawbaugh's shop in 1874 and swears that he
never heard anything about telephones. Drawbaugh, who
saw him before we did, tried to make him think he remembered them, lut in vain.
Henry .B. Musser, a farmer, went to Drawbaugh's shop
several times to have his mowing machine repaired, between
1874 and 1878, inclusive, but each year in June, the mowing
season. He fixes the dates of each of those visits by payments
entered in his farm books. He says he saw the tumbler and
tin can and once talked through them, and his recollection is
that this was at his first visit, in June, 1874. On the witness
stand he made a diagram of the arrangement of the rooms
where the tumbler and tin can were at the only visit when
he tried them, and where the wires ran; the partitions be
so described did not exist until 1875 and remained until April,
1878. He undertook to describe the other things that he saw
at the same time when he talked through the tumbler and tin
can, and he testified to seeing at that time a number of electric
clocks; in fact these did not exist before the summer of 187'(.
lHe has seen the later instruments there, but not in the same
year when he tried F and B. This puts the tumbler and tin
can as the best instruments after the Bell patent, and refutes
the previous existence of better ones.
Several witnesses got into trouble in the same way by
letting the fact be known that they saw at the same time the
early telephones and some remarkable clocks which Drawbaugh admits did not exist until one or two years after the
Bell patent.

XAs. Dalr testifies that she moved away from the village
in 1870, and before she left she used to hear a great deal
about Drawbaugh's telephones. That seemed to fix a date,
but upon cross-examination she testified that at the same time,
and while living there, she also heard a great deal about his
electric clock, particularly about its being carried over to Har.
risburg to be exhibited. That clock was not made until the
fall of 1877, and was exhibited in Harrisburg in May, 1878.
Decker went there several times, and undertakes to fix one
particular time, a year or two before the Bell patent, as the
time when he particularly remembers hearing speech through
the telephone. On direct examination he detailed the conversation between himself and Drawbaugh through the telephone; it was about the birth of the child of one of his neighbors. We called the neighbor, and his first child was born a
year after the Bell patent.
George W. Drawbaugh,a nephew of Daniel, the olaimant,
said that he first knew of his uncle's speaking telephone at
the time when he and his uncle, at his uncle's shop, were
painting a certain wagon to be used by the firm of Drawbaugh Sadler, consisting of Daniel Drawbaugh, the claimant, and one Jacob Sadler, now dead. He does not exactly
remember the date, but he got the lumber for the wagon
from one Lee, and Lee's only charge against George Drawbaugh for lumber is in Merch, 1870. He then produced
a witness _Ditlow, who said that George Drawbaugh told him
all about the exhibition at the time. Ditlow first testified as
a witness for us that this was in 1877, a year after the Bell
patent; but afterwards was prevailed upon by Drawbaugh
to come back on the witness stand and swear that hd did not
well remember the date himself, but that in the spring of 1870
be went to the West to live (coming back generally for the
winter), and told all this to people out there. A number of
people from Indiana swore that he told it to them there in
the spring of 1870, and could not have told it later because
they knew him then and did not meet him afterwards. That
story hung together extremely well, and seemed to fix 1870 as
a date, until presently wve got hold of the accounts of the firm

Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

of Drawbaugh & Sadler. That firm did not exist until 1871,
and the wagon was not painted until 1871, so the whole
labored chain of circumstances is pure delusion or fabrication.
These are only some out of a number of samples. More
than a dozen out of his fifty speech-hearing witnesses were
destroyed in this way. More than half are destroyed by the
proved incapacity of F and B to talk. But it is not merely
those specific witnesses who go by the board. There is no
character left in a record of which they were the most important part. The court below found that his witnesses were
mostly ignorant men whose memories were confused about
what they saw or when they saw it, and whom Drawbaugh,
with the aid of friendship and local feeling, had beguiled into
believing untruths, and put them forward to swear to them.
I The testimony furnishes some very curious proofs of this
,onfusion of memories. We have already referred to the fact
of a string telephone, in the village, at least. Other instances
are more striking. Caytain Mloore, one of the most intelligent of his witnesses, carried on business at Drawbaugh's
shop, with Drawbaugh for his superintendent, from March,
1875, to the fall of 1876. He never attempted to talk with
any instrument, but saw some machines which he does not
well remember, but thinks they were for speech. They had
magnets, and were to be used without a battery; and he testified on direct examination that Drawbaugh said that they
were to be used as a substitute for the fire-alarm telegraph.
Now a speaking telephone could not well be so used. But
Drawbaugh's magneto telegraph key, which he certainly had
at that time, was intended by him for that use; he offered it
for that purpose to the fire-alarm superintendent at Harrisburg, and his advertising cards of 1873-6 expressly stated its
fitness for that purpose. -. TV. .- kney testified that Drawbaugh told him that he had a Mechanicsburg man to go in
with him on the telephone, and Shovp says that Drawbaugh
was going to exhibit at the Centennial. We know from
Drawbaugh that it was only his clock that any Mechanicsburg man thought of taking an interest in, and that it was
only the clock that he thought of exhibiting at the Centen-

nial. -One of the most striking instruments produced was the
tall H (the Blake transmitter), which most of the witnesses
identify by the bell on top (only the lower edge of which is
shown in the cut). We know as a matter of fact, from his
own cross-examination, that he had in his shop from 1873, or
thereabouts, to the present time, some alarm bells to be rung
by electricity, for use in hotels. Shettle, one of his most conspicuous witnesses, swears that he saw in 1876 or 1877 an
instrument which he recollects as H ; that he recognizes it by
the bell; that they did not talk through it; that Drawbaugh
did not tell him it was a talking machine, but told him it wa&
to be used for calling in hotels, and that all Drawbaugh did
in showing it to the witness was to ring the bell.
Wb have already pointed, out from Mr. Matthews' Baltimore Ameriran article, and Drawbaugh's preservation of the
Soientific American article of 1863, his early attention to the
"phonic telegraph." That was a plan of a machine which
was to send words by sounds, and supersede the existing telegraph. With the class of men he called as witnesses, testifying in 1882-4 to ancient occurrences in a shop where they had
seen telephones ever since 1876, and an abundance of electrical contrivance they did not understand before that, this was
a sufficient basis for their confusion.
The absolute contrast and inconsistency between the story
told by Drawbaugh and his witnesses and the actual facts of
his life and his own repeated statements in writing before the
controversy began, compel the conclusion reached by the Circuit Court that in its essential features, and the only feature
which the law makes the turning point, to wvit: on the question whether he had a practical speaking telephone before the
Bell patent, the story is a fabrication, - an intentional fabrication by Drawbaugh, supported by witnesses'in part dishonestr
in larger part misled by him, These witnesses as a class are
shown to be unreliable. Against them, or such of them as do
not destroy themselves, or are not destroyed by others we!
have the fact, established beyond controversy, and chiefly out
of his own mouth, that neither his partners, nor the telegraph
superintendents, nor his friend Weaver, the patent solicitor,

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

nor his fellow-workman David Hauck, ever heard of the existence of such an instrument. Actual count shows on the one
hand fifty-one witnesses who swear that they heard speech in
the course of ten years, (mostly with F and B, proved to be
incapable ofspeech,) and other witnesses who say they saw or
heard of the instruments, but did not take interest enough to
try them; and on the other hand seventy-five persons, intimate friends and intimates of his shop, who are proved, not by
their own recollection alone, but by their history and conduct,
and by Drawbaugh's testimony, to have had no knowledge of
the existence of a telephone. These mein are virtually his
witnesses, for they are part of the class whom the law required him to call, and whose memory he in fact appealed to.
The weight of the oral testimony, especially when judged by
the rule laid down by Lord Mansfield, is on our side; buti in
this conflict of testimony, the general history of the claimant,
the confessed fact that this great invention never got into use
by a single human being from his alleged work, coupled with
his own history and his own declarations, with the proof of his
habitual falsifications in the testimony, e~pecially as to poverty, leave the case free from doubt. It would be enough
that they left it in doubt, for the rule is settled that whoever
atacks a long-established patent, as this man did for the first
time in 1880,.-a patent for an invention so startling that the
moment it existed in the most rudimentary form it arrested universal attention, - and does that with the story that the invention in a perfected form in his hands never attracted attention
enough to make anybody desire to use it, and who rests such
a story on oral recollections of fact and of date, -must make
out a case free from doubt. To raise a doubt is to resolve it

entirely within the control of the party asserting it; and so
wide is the opportunity for deception, artifice or mistake, that
the authorities are almost unanimous in holding that it must
be established by proof, clear, positive and unequivocal."
Poverty is the only ground on which Drawbaugh attempted
to reconcile the story alleged and the history proved. There
is no suggestion in the record that the great gulf between his
story and his life, - between the alleged existence of the invention and the proof that no marks or fruits of it are found,
- can be bridged over by any lack of appreciation. On the
contrary, it is a part of his story that he believed it to be of
enormous importance and vast pecuniary value, and that for
ten years he was so engrossed in it that he could think of
nothing else. The answer says that nothing but his abject
poverty prevented him from patenting it, and from manufacturing instruments for commercial use; that after he had first
got good speech, he perceived that improvements would "increase its value to himself and the public," and therefore
labored on it with great zeal and assiduity. He testifies that
from 1867 for ten years he worked at it uxiceasingly, laying it
aside only occasionally, and with reluctance, to earn bread for
his family, whom he kept reduced (so he avers) to great pov-erty for this cause. The court below found that poverty was
the only excuse offered, and that that excuse was false in fact.
He called forty witnesses (whose testimony to this point is
collected in our brief) to swear that during the whole time he
asserted the importance and the value of the invention. "He
said it was the greatest invention ever known." "He said
he could run it out for miles, and parties could talk the same
as persons in a room together." It was "to supersede the
telegraph." "MAy fortune lies in this.'" "He said it would be
a fortune to him." "If I can accomplish it, it will be worth
thousands to me." "Would be worth a great deal of money."
"I have a talking machine that beats, all the other of my inveiidtons." "He said he could make a fortune out of it."
"Would astonish the world." "If he would be able to get it
accomplished, he would be a very rich man some day." "If
he is successful in getting it finished, he will be the richest

man in the valley." "It would surpass the telegraph."
"When it was perfected, there would be no trouble to connect
one point with, another." "More wonderful and handier than
the telegraph." "It will take the place of telegraphing, and
be cheaper." "If he could get this accomplished, get it
patented, he would be one of the richest men." "His whole
heart and desire was on the telephone." They swore that
they saw his shop usually lighted late at night, and always
believed he was working on the talking machine, and that he
habitually neglected his work to labor on the talking machine.
"He appeared crazy on it. I often tried to get information
from him on other subjects, and about half a minute's talk
would turn him right on the talking machine-that is about
his standing - the way he felt all the time I was there
(1873-6)." Unfortunately for the credit of this witness (Holsinger), he, during that period, wrote two newspaper articles
praising Drawbaugh's inventions. He described his clock, but
did not mention the telephone among them.
His other occupations, his experiments on other and foolish
contrivances, show this to be an absolutely false picture, and
condemin all these witnesses. But the gossip, as they give it,.
during all the years down to a period as late as 1877, theyear
after the Bell patent, is that "if he gets it accomplished" he
will be rich. Such gossip, whenever it was, together with the
fact that he had sufficient means and tools, tells the history
of a man who did iwt "accomplish." We believe, however,
that these witnesses have entirely confused their memories
of the many other things which he did before 1876 yvith the
telephones which he made after 1876.
The burden is on him to show the truth of his history. Nor
does the law find it essential to know just what he did, in
order to decide against him. It puts one single inquiry : Did
he have a practically successful speaking telephone before
Bell's invention? Because, if he did not have that; it is not
important to know whether he had nothing, or whether he
had something that fell short of that. Therefore, if his history and surrounding circumstances*are inconsistent with that,
his case is disposed of, and the law does not seek whether
there was some insufficient foundation for a false claim.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

The history of the alleged maker of so startling an invention is not evidence which simply bears upon the. probability
of a story which may be true, It is the strongest legal proof
against it or for it, as the facts may be. In Atlantic lVorks v.
Thray, 107 U. S. 192, 203, this court declared that where this
proof was all one way, no judicial action could be based on
mere 'recollections to the contrary. In the sewing machine
case (Howe v. Underwood, 1 Fish. Pat. Cas. 160, 165), Judge
Sprague rehearsed tle proof from recollections, and then
stated the proof from the undisputed facts of the man's interest. These are two lines of positive proof, said he, so inconsistent that one or the other must yield, and that statement of
the question answered it.
The argument of the value of a cloud of witnesses, which is
the whole reliahce of the other side, is all against Drawbaugh.
It is a well recognized fact that the illusions of memory are
more common than the omissions of memory. That the partners and others -

that these seventy-five men

-

would have

known of and used the telephone if it had publicly existed, is
certain. That such a cloud of intimates could have known of
it, and forgotten it, is impossible. But that an unobservant
set of men who have always seen and heard of much at his
shop they did not understand or take interest in, and had seen
and heard of telephones at his shop for five or six years
before they testified, should now think they remember what
in fact they did not then, but have seen and heard much of
since, and should confuse their memories as to the subject they
did see, and the time when they saw it, is consonant to daily
experience, and to the observations of writers on the subject.
The courts know this. "The confidence of the attacking witnesses is often in proportion to the distance in time that the
one, is removed from the other. Their imagination is wrought
upon by the influences to which their minds are subjected, and
beguiles their memory." Swayne, J., in Wood v. Cleveland
Rolling M71ill Co., 4 Fish. Pat. Cas. 550. Of all causes for
delusion in dates, none is so potent as the contrivance which
Drawbaugh has generally induced his witnesses to resort to the arbitrary association, by mere memory, of events which

TELEPHONE CASES:Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

have no necessary relation to each other; as the attempt to
fix the date of a particular visit to the shop by pretending to
remember that it was while the witness lived in one house
rather than another, and then casting a glamor of authenticity
over the whole by producing a dated deed of the house selected. See U. S. Stamping Co. v. Jewett, 18 Blatch. 469.
Te magneto instruments ) and P.
E
Of all the instruments alleged to have been made before the Bell patent, the
tests of the so-called reproductions show that none would
physically suffice to overturn the patent except the magneto
instruments D and E. The defence cannot be supported,
therefore, except upon proof of the date of these two instruments. From the tests made at a comparatively early period
in the case it was evident that it must turn on the dates of
these. The defendants took four hundred depositions. Yet,
out of this vast number, and from four years scouring of. the
whole country, they were able to find only seven men who
even pretended to have heard a word through D and E before
the Bell patent. The story is that these instruments existed a
whole year before the Bell patent. Their perfection and clearness, in spite of some weakness, must have been such as to
satisfy the most incredulous that when they were made' the
problem had been solved, and that whoever had them had
instruments fit for commercial use. If they 'wee *madebefore
telephones were in use in the world, they must have produced
an enormous effect on Drawbaugh, on all his family and
friends, and upon all of the many hundred people who are
alleged to have known of his telephone. The fact that under
these circumstances his utmost research can find only seven
men who pretended to have got 'speech through them, is of
itself decisive. These seven men, however, sift *down upon
the first critical examination of their testimony into almost
nothing. They are as follows:
-Dec7mr swears that he heard speech through them in. the
fall of 1874. The claim made by.Drawbaugh's counsel and
sought to be supported by their proofs is that they first existed. in the spring.-of.1875. * Decker is the man who talked
through a telephone about his neighbor's baby several. years
before it was born.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

Jerry Fry was the storekeeper in the village from the spring
of 1875 to the spring of 1880. At some time, which he says
he fixes by mere memory as April, 1875, he heard singing,but
no speech, through something which he thinks was D and E,
and thereupon he told one of his neighbors, he says, that "it
would be a very good thing if Drawbaugh gets it accomplished."
Real speaking telephones like D and E never
would produce that effect; nor has he any way of fixing
a date.
Isaac .fillard testified that he heard through them in 1874,
which is before Drawbaugh, pretends they were made; he
afterwards was brought by leading questions to say he
thought it was in 1875; but he had already sworn that in
1869 he plainly heard speech through the tumbler and tin can
which we know caniiot talk, and he also swore that in 1869
he heard speech over a certain out-door line which Drawbaugh
himself testifies did not exist until 1878.
Fettrow, the blacksmith of the town, who hired half of
Drawbaugh's house and lived under the same roof with him
from 1868 to April, 1876, and has lived in the same house ever
since, says that it was in 1875, accc -ding to his recollection,
that Drawbaugh for the first time alluded to the subject to
him. At some time, which he thinks was in 1875, he talked
through something which he thinks was D and E. He has
been at the shop from once a week to once a month ever
since. He says that he has continually seen talking machines,
but never tried to -talk through one at any other time, and has
no other definite recollection about them.
Holsinger' is the witness who swore that Drawbaugh's
whole heart and soul were on-the telephone from the time he,
the wi4ness, first moved to Eberly's Mills in 1873 until he left
in 1876, and that he hardly knew of Drawbaugh ever working
on -anything else,, unless it might be his magneto telegraph
key. Yet during that time Drawbapgh was absorbed in the
various pieces of experimental work that have been mentioned.
lHolsinger-w'as the printer who, in 1874 and again in 1786,
printed the card enumerating eighteen other inventions but
not the telephone; and ]4olsinger was the newspaper writer

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

who in the fall of 1875, and again in the fall of 1876, wrote
newspaper articles speaking of the clock as Drawbaugh's real
work, and making no allusion to the telephone.
HEarmon K..Drawbaugk is the claimant's nephew, and says
that he did substantially all the work of making the instruments D and E, under his uncle's direction. Holsinger swears
that with his own eyes, day after day, he saw Drawbaugh
himself making them.
These six men were all the witnesses who pretended to have
heard speech through D and E during the first taking of testimony for the defence. In the fourth year -of the case, when
they were completing their four hundred witnesses (called
mostly to the most remote, trivial, and incompetent collateral matters), and after the incapacity of the instruments preceding D and E had been proved, Drawbaugh made great
efforts to get some more witnesses to swear to this pair. He
succeeded in getting only two, and they were such as would
destroy any case for which they'might be called.
John Simmons, an old inhabitant of the village, testified that
he has worked in Drawbaugh's shop most of the time since 1880,
and was in his employ at the time he testified; that during the
taking of the testimony, and a few months before he himself testified, he stated to the complainant's representative that
he knew nothing about the telephone. Afterwards, in 1884,
he went on the witness stand and testified that it had suddenly
come to him that he remembered all about it, and had talked
through D and E, in November, 1875, but that he never mentioned that circumstance to any one until he told it to the
defendants' counsel the day he testified. Yet during the whole
of the time of taking testimony, and for three years preceding
his deposition, he was employed by Drawbaugh as a workman
in his shop, and talked with him about the case.
George .71ay lived in Drawbaugh's village from 1874 to the
day he testified in 1884. He is a farm laborer, and perhaps
the stupidest among all the witnesses. He says that when
testimony was first being taken in 1881-2 Drawbaugh asked
him "whether I didn't mind the time he showed it to me in
1875." He had no recollection then, and was not called. But

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.

jist at the end of the case, and after he had heard the matter
talked over for four years in the little village, he suddenly remembered all about it, and testified in 1884 that Drawbaugh
talked through D and E with him in M1arch, 1875, and he knew
that was the time because Drawbaugh sharpened a razor for him
that year. When asked what else he saw and did on that occasion, he describes seeing the instrument H with as much
certainty as D and E. Drawbaugh's own story is that the instrument H did not exist until the fall of 1876.
This testimony about D and E is the whole proof on which
Drawbaugh's case must depend.
.Drawbaughhimself is not among those who swear to the
existence or use of those instruments before the Bell patent.
After the first- six enumerated witnesses had testified, Drawbaugh was called. His counsel did not dare to ask him when
he made the instruments D and E, nor even if he made them
before the Bell patent. They were put into his hands, and he
was told, by a 'question objected to as leading and incompetent, that his nephew Harmon had testified that they were
made in January or February, 1875, and he was asked by his
own counsel, "Have you any recollection of the fact or not?"
and he answered, "I have no r'ecollection of the time, but I
recollect of Harmon working on the machine. One of them
.was made before that time. What I mean is, that there was
one of them made, and Harmon made, or helped to make, the
other. I cannot remember, the year or the date of it."
Afterwards he was again asked which instruments he had
made prior to the time when the Axle Company carried on
business in the shop; their business began March, 1875, and
ended in the fall of 1876. He says: "I won't positively say
that D and E were prior to the Axle Company, but I know
that at the time the Axle Company was running I had them
there. It may have been prior to the starting of the Axle
Company. It may be, but I do not want to be too positive."
The claimant himself, therefore, will not swear that those
instruments were made before the Bell patent. The court
must tell him, for he cannot tell the court. If he had had
these perfect instruments eighteen months when he heard of

TELEPHONE CASES.
Ar. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

Bell's invention and Centennial exhibition in the summer of
1876, as he said he did, he could not have forgotten that fact.
He knows that they did not then exist, and he does not dare
to run the risk of a prosecution for perjury on that specific
fact. When he will not swear that these instruments were
made before the Bell patent, thie court in such a case cannot,
as matter of law, find that they were. Certainly it will not
on such meagre testimony as he has produced, and in the face
of the facts of his history. But though Drawbaugh didnot
even know in what year they were made, he personally tried
to get May to swear to so definite a date as March, 1875, and
persisted until he succeeded.
The defendant's witnesses who swear to D and E -both
those who say they heard speech and those who say they casually saw them but never tried them -invariably profess to
recognize them by the "curled" or snail-shaped steel magnet at
the back of D (vide p. 400, &upra). It is certain that they never
saw it. This magnet in exhibit D is fastened very loosely by
one end to one end of the sliding core of the electro-magnet.
The rest of this curled magnet is entirely unsupported, and its
mode of attachment is such that the least handling breaks it
away and throws it out of place; so that as soon as the exhibit
came to be used in evidence, a block of wood and a screw
which are now present were put in after it had been filed, in
order to preserve it from destruction. When the instrument
was first made, the magnet was inclosed by a wooden cover,
a duplicate of which now exists in E. Drawbaugh says that
this cover became broken and lost off, and was not replaced.
It is certain from the condition of the magnet and the mode
of its attachment that the instrument never was used.for
many days without the cover, because it would have fallen
to pieces. The loss of the cover, therefore, must have been,
not at the very beginning of the life of the instrument, but
at about the time when it ceased to be used and became
superseded by later instruments. With that cover on, the
curled magnet cannot be seen, and the arrangement of the adjusting screw is such that the cover, once put on, could not be
taken off without breaking it to pieces or taking the instruVOL. cxxvi-29

ment apart. Yet every one of the witnesses who testify to
this instrument, including those who profess to have seen it
before it was a month old, swear that they recognized it by
"the curled magnet." It is obvious that they never could
lave seen that magnet, and that, as it is now a striking feature,
their professed memory is the result of recent observation, and
not of recollection.
Again, Drawbaugh's nephew, Harmon -Drawaxugh, says
that he finished and put together the metal work of these
instruments. He swears that when they were first made, two
sets of curled magnets were forged, and that one set was then
made by Fettrow, the village blacksmith. The date when
Fettrow made these magnets would therefore settle the date
of the instruments. Now .Fettrow produced at Drawbaugh's
call all the accounts between himself and Drawbaugh from
1869 to April, 1876. He testified that they contained every
item between himself and Drawbaugh; and in fact they did
contain mary items as low as ten cents for little pieces of iron
and steel and forgings. Yet during the two years prior to April,
1876, there is no charge for magnets, and no charge for any
piece of steel or metal whatever out of which those magnets
could possibly have been made. It is certain from these
accounts, therefore, that they were not made before April,
1876. All these pieces of testimony were commented upon at
the first hearing before Judge Wallace, in October, 1884.
The defendants afterwards took an additional volume of testimony, but made no attempt to meet these fatal pieces of
proof then upon the record.
A number of witnesses called by Drawbaugh testify that the
instruments which Drawbaugh showed as his best, at some
time after the Bell patent, were the tuibler and tin can.
Urias Nichols, for example, who went there at a date which
we now have proved was in January, 1878, swears that the
instruments he talked through were the tumbler and tin can,
and he did not see -D and E. So with Samuel Nichols.
Springer testifies that he moved to the village in April, 1876,
which was after the Bell patent, and lived there for nine
months, and experimented with Drawbaugh almost every day.

He says that for several months when he first went there they
used the tumbler and tin can exclusively, and that, after that,
Drawbaugh said to him that lie had now got some instruments
which would talk both ways, and produced D and E as novelties, and the witness had never seen them before.
Testinony about 187, and 1876, and later.-A

number of

witnesses called by us, personal friends of Drawbaugh, first
heard of his having any t6lephone in Qctober, 1816, and were
then shown by Drawbaugh the tin can. as all he had. The
testimony of one set of these witnesses, Shapkey .and his
brothers-in-law, is very convincing. Mr. Shapley was a jeweller and watchmaker at Mechanicsburg, a few miles from
Drawbaugh's village. Indeed, Drawbaugh lived in Mechanicsburg from April, 18M, to April, 1877, while the Bell patent became famous. Mr. Shapley is a well-to-do, intelligent man, and
he and Drawbaugh had been acquainted for many years. In
1876, Shapley had two thousand dollars lying idle which he
was seeking employment for, and Dr'awbaugh, knowing of
that, went to him to absorb the money. He offered to Shapley an interest in his electric clock invention, not then patented,
and Shapley made with him a written conditional contract,
dated November 8, 1878, to take it ifon examination he liked it,
and paid him $20 on account. In October, 1876, Shapley went
to Drawbaugh's shop with his brdther-in-law Landis, another
watchmaker, and they examined the clock. A few weeks afterwards, Drawbaugh brought the clock to Shapley's store, set it
up, arranged his earth batteries, and had it runfiing: and Shapley
paid about $20 more for the expenses of this. Then Shapley
made another electric clock like it with his own hands, in order
to better test the invention. 'Finally discovering that that
clock, like all others of its kind, could- not possibly be a good
timekeeper, owing to the variations in the strength of the
electric current, he gave up the bargain.
Drawbaugh's story is that his 'utmost endeavors were
directed to getting somebody to advance money enough .to
patent his telephones and manufacture them. Between June
and October, 1876, Mr. Bell's Centennial exhibition had attracted the attention of every one to the telephone. Draw-

baugh had read the accounts of it, and they had been published in the local papers. If he then had, not Bell's feeble
membrane diaphragm instruments of the Centennial, but the
excellent magnetos D and E, and the Blake transmitter HI, it
is not in human nature that,-coming into contact with his
friend Mr. Shapley, who was ready to invest several thousand dollars in his inventions, he would not have asked him to
invest it in the telephone. It is not in human nature that he
should not have told Shapley that he had these wonderful instruments if he had them, and shown them to Shapley when Shapley
was at his shop in dctober, 1876. And when he wanted to create
a sensation in the town by an exhibition in Shapley's shop, in
bNgvember, 1876, after the newspaper accounts of Bell had
excited the whole world about the electrical transmission of
speech, it is impossible to believe that he would have got
Shapley to spend $20 in carrying his clock there and setting
it up, when the little magnetos which could be used without a battery or a moment's preparation would have far surpassed any possible clock in novelty and in interest. Yet
it is the concurrent testimony of Mr. Shapley, of his brotherin-law Mr. Landis, and of Drawbaugh himself, that Drawbaugh never asked Shapley to invest any money in the telephone, nor pretended to them for one moment that he was the
first inventor of it,-nor made any reference to it beyond what
Shapley testified as follows:
Mr. Shapley took the Scientif American, and Drawbaugh
was in the habit of reading it at his shop and borrowing the
papers. In September, 1876, the Scientific American described Bell's Centennial telephone as consisting of a tin can
with a bladder across one end, carrying an iron armature, and
an electro-magnet in front of that armature; and Drawbaugh
testifies that about this time he read somewhere a description
of Bell's instruments. In October, 1876, (the date is positively fixed,) Shapley and Landis were at Drawbaugh's shop.
They both agree, and Drawbaugh does not contradict it, that
he showed them the tin can instrument which corresponds
to that description of Bell's apparatus, (and no other instrument,) and told them that that was an invention which was

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

going to make a great stir in the world. Yet he did not hint
to them that he was the originator of it; that he had had it
for nine years; and that in that very room, twelve feet square,
where they were, he had instruments-the magnoetos D and
E, the carbon microphones G, 0, and the Blake transmitter
H- which far surpassed anything that anybody dreamed of at
that time. That was the time when he was first trying to interest Shapley in some invention, -he did not care what. And his
story is that he thought the telephone the greatest thing ever
made, and that he knew that $50 for a patent would insure
fame and fortune, and he was in search of a partner.
A few days afterwards Drawbaugh was at Shapley's shop,
and Shapley produced a copy of the Socientific American with
a description of the Reis telephone, (issuer of March 4, .1876,)
and said to Drawbaugh that that was the kind of: thing that
he appeared to be working on, and gave him the paper.
Drawbaugh agrees to all this. He kept the paper, and produced it on his cross-examination. But Drawbaugh never
suggested to Shapley to join him in a telephone; never said
that he invented it nine years before. He has never offered
any explanation of how his story could be reconciled with
these facts.
The evidence in his own record relating to 1875 and 1876
makes an equally strong case against him. The .Axle Company,
so-called, a partnership of four persons, employed Drawbaugh
as their foreman, to make at his machine shop their patented
axle. Their bisiness began in March, 1875, and was not finally
terminated until November, 1876-eight months after the
Bell patent. Drawbaugh called. Bear and Gr ve, two of the
four partners composing the Axle Company, and they, with
an exhibition of great dulness and worthless memories, say
that they think they probably saw telephones while they were
there; Bear's chief reason for thinking so being, as he expresses
it, "I have no doubt, as Mr. Drawbaugh explained to me often
about his inventions, that he spoke of his talking machine."
That is a good sample of the condition of mind of his .neighbors who testified for him. They, assume that he had them,
and, ashamed to confess that they do not remember" them, vie

with each other in "recollection."
Neither of these men pretend to any distinct recollection, and neither of them pretend
ever to have talked through the instruments. Kline, the
inventor of that patent axle, was at the shop a great deal, and
must have known all about the telephones if they were there.
The defendants drew from one of our witnesses on cross-examination. the fact that while the taking of testimony was going
on, Kline declared that he never knew of any telephone there;
and in spite of that the defendants did not call him. The
remaining member of the Axle Company was Captain.Atoore,
a man of means, intelligence, and education; one of the three
or four men* of intelligence and education among all the
defendants' witnesses. He says that during the time of his
axle business, -which was until eight months, after the Bell
patent, -Drawbaugh spoke to him about his talking machine,
and asked him to advance money to patent it, and that he
(Moore) felt a good deal of interest in it. He was asked by
Drawbaugh's counsel whether during that time Drawbaugh
did not show him the tumbler F and tin can B, and he assented,
and says that they then had the bladders on. He thinks that
he also casually saw Drawbaugh at some time working on
something which he says may or may not have been talking
machines, but that is all. The inquiry thus put to him by
Drawbaugh on the witness stand and his answer amount to a
statement by Drawbaugh as well as by himself that the tumbler and tin can with the bladders on -that is not superseded
- were the only telephone instruments specifically shown him
during all the time he was there, down to the fall of 1876. If
that be true, it is certain that the story that D and E were
made before Captain Moore ever went there, and had long
superseded F and B, which had consequently become dismantled, is false. Captain Moore thinks that this exhibition of F
and B was in the early summer of 1875, but he has no possible
way of fixing the date. There is no trace of the enthusiasm
Drawbaugh would have shown if his story of eight years'
anticipation of Bell were true. It is impossible, if D, E, and
H existed, that Captain Mloore could have been asked such
questions by Drawbaugh or could have disclosed such a history.

TELEPHONE CASES.

,mr. Storrow's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

Captain Moore's testimony shows that he has confused the
tin can telephone B, which we have no doubt he saw in the
fall of 1876, or later (after Drawbaugh had read of Bell's), with
Drawbaugh's magneto key, which he undoubtedly saw in the
early part of 1875 (p. 439, stpra).
Suiana y.-In short, Drawbaugh's history is this. All his
life he has been a professional inventor and patentee, and has
made his living chiefly by selling his inventions. He was
always able to find partners to join his enterprises. During
the ten years before the Bell patent he himself received in
actual cash $10,000; his friends and neighbors embarked
$30,000 on his inventions, and offered to exploit other inventions if he had any to present. His story is that during. all
those years he had practical speaking telephones, fully realized
that a fortune awaited him if he could patent them or make
them for sale, and failed to do it solely from abject poverty
himself and inability to obtain aid from others. Yet he spent
more. time and money experimenting on various gimcracks of
no value than would have sufficed to make a hundred telephones and patent them a dozen times over, and not one of
his partners or the intelligent men around him, or the telegraph superintendeifts to whom he showed his other electrical
contrivances, ever 1ieard that he had a telephone.
By the summer of 1876, if his story be true, he had then
put into- his own instruments nearly all the improvements
which a hundred inventors have since labored to produce.
Yet no one of these instruments, and no information derived
from him, ever found its way to the public, ever led to any
knowledge by others, ever made the slightest mark by which
it can be traced. Just when he had thus (according to his
story) reached high-water mark, he heard that Bell, by an
instrument at the Centennial so rude and feeble that Drawbaugh's alparatus of ten years before-if his story be true
surpassed it, had conquered the fame and fortune which
-far
he pretends was his own due, and which for ten years had
been the spur that had urged him to privation and toil. Yet
this did not wring from him an utterance of anguish or reclamation. He went to the Centenmiial with George Leonard,

who for ten years had been his next door neighbor. But he
did not carry any telephones. The subject was not mentioned
to his companion; who had never heard that Drawbaugh had
a telephone.
To his friend Shapley, who had a couple
of thousand dollars

ready to invest in some invention of Drawbaugh's, he showed
in October, 1876, a tin can-just like the Bell telephone already described in the newspapers - and spoke of the importance of the invention, but did not'hint that he had originated
it, nor that he had perfected instruments which left it ten

years behind; and, to use Shapley's money, he proposed an
electric clock which he had copied out of an encyclopedia
with some trivial changes, and never offered a telephone.
In 1874-, and again in 1876, he printed and published a list

of his inventions, and the telephone is not alnong them. In
1875, and again in 1876, his most intimate friend wrote about

his inventions in the county newspaper, but did not mention
the telephone. In the spring of, 1878, several newspaper
writers, attracted by large and very expensive electric clocks
which his tools and resources enabled him to make, visited his
shop: 'They spoke of him ds then making improvements in
the telephone, which, by that time, was in extensive use, and
excited great attention, but to none of them did he say that
he originated that, great invention; yet his present story
is that all those improvements had been completed eighteen
months before. An autobiography- published in 1878-9 substantially repeats this. To oie writer only did he speak
of past work, and those statements, made to so considerable
a person as a friendly editor of the Baltimore American, and.
published in that year, were that he had tried to make a "telephone," but that it was for a musical telegraph, with no exjvetation q speech.
In 'the fall of 1878, he got partners to patent and make an
improved molasses faucet he had invented eight or ten years
before.. He show(el them his improved telephones (1r.Blake's
transmitter had just gone into commercial use within a few
weeks), and their manufacture was discussed, but, after tilking with him, they determined not to try it because Bell had

the bottom patent, and they concluded that "Drawbaugh
could not antedate him." Yet one of them had been his intimate friend and visitor for ten years. With the attention of
these persons thus drawn to what he had done, and when he
did it, came the episode of the Hauck interference testimony.
All other of Drawbaugh's inventions did not go beyond inprovements of detail in well-known machines. Neither the
scope of his mind, nor the range of his knowledge, approached
the regions of thought where this invention can be created.
He was (the telephone apart) a charlatan and an impostor, for
he made his neighbors believe that he was a great originator,
by showing them his copies of other men's work. In this faucet testimony he raised the issue, and undertook by himself
and his shopmate Hauck, to prove the scope of his genius.
The testimony of both left it just wher& we have stated it.
He named contrivance after contrivance which he had made,
but he only repeated the list of his advertisements of 1874-6,
and did not hint at the invention which would have established
him at once. No claim to that invention was then thought of :
he and the same men who now make the great claim for him
could then find nothing better to spend time and money on thau
a molasses spigot., This was in May and June, 1879. Two
months later, these same men called in their present principal
counsel (Mr. Hill) to look at his Blake transmitter and his
microphones, to study his story, and see whether it was worth
while to file an application or do anything about it. But his
and their determination was to drop the business. They did
nothing.
A year later, in the summer of 1880, when the Bell patent
was more than four years old and its profits held out a great
temptation, Drawbaugh was first produced as a claimant, only
to furnish a defence to some infringing speculators. One
man who was his partner, and two, who were his counsel, got
three-quarters of his pretensions for nothing. Without spending or promising to spend a cent, they sold his story in a few
days for $20,000 in money and an untold amount of stock.
The infringing speculators who bought the claim did not
want his telephones, and never used them. But they capital-

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.

ized his story at five million dollars of "stock" and advertised
that in a few weeks they would compel the Bell company to
buy them out by paying a "magnificent royalty." Disap'
pointed in that, and forced to fight (for the Bell Company
refused to purchase and brought this suit at once), they told a
story of invention-and success which is falsified by every act of
the claimant's life, by every piece of paper which helped to tell
-his history or enumerated the inventions he had made, and
by every statement he has made in conversation and under
oath, down to the time they bought and produced him. Their
own action showed that they themselves disbelieved his story
and only used him to speculate on.
They told of perfected telephones existing and well known
for years in his shop, -but which never went outside its walls,
never reproduced themselves, never were heard of at the
Patent Office, never excited in any person the desire to have
one, never imparted to any one the knowledge how to make
one, - and yet the claimant was a professional inventor and
patentee.
They acknowledged that such a story contradicted itself,
and tried to reconcile it with his life by the plea of constraining poverty and by no other plea. But this, in its whole
&rift and substance and in all its important features of detail,
is proved by Drawbaugh's own confession to be false. With
it falls the case, the character of Drawbaugh who proffered
it, and the value of the "memories" by which he sought to
support it.
. During all the years under inquiry he was surrounded by
prominent and wealthy partners who advanced money for
other inventions, but never heard of this. His partners and
his friends the telegraph superintendents and others were
such that if he had had the invention, they would have
known of it; and if they had known of it, the public history of the telephone would have begun before Bell was
heard of.
All this history consists of facts which are not capable of
controversy, and does not depend upon fallible memories.
Memories also are against him, for his partners and his shop-

mates do not know of the invention; and if they had known
it, they would have remembered it now, and acted on it then.
In the face of this, he relies on the assertion that facts
and dates which large numbers of witnesses have sworn to
must be true. But this is destroyed by the fact that the
instruments which he and half his witnesses have sworn to as
perfect talkers are proved by his own public tests to be incapable of speech, by the fact that the picture of" exclusive and
unremitting devotion"to the telephone which they tell is shown
by his own account of his other occupations to be absolutely
untrue, while witness after witness, tested in detail, is found
to tell a story essentially false either as to the material fact
or the material date. This destroys his argument from numbers. In such a case, moreover, the reason of the rulefasus
in uno falsus in omnibus applies. That rule does not necessarily mean that the man who falsifies once is a liar; but it
means that justice will not rest on testimony a substantial
part of which is proved to be false. How much more so in
a case which depends on mere oral recollections against every
fact of his life, and which is generated under such circumstances as surrounded the origin of this defence. No balancing
of depositions is needed. 'The law pronounces that it cannot
rest such a claim on such a record.

Dickerson for the American Bell Telephone

The incongruity of the several defences shows that to this
great patent there is no one ground upon which any two of
the numerous counsel against us can agree, and each finds the
defences offered by the other to be so vain that he washes his
hahids of them. Nothing more is needed to show their thoroughly artificial and hollow character.
Dolbear says that Bell invented the only way in which it is
possible to transmit speech, and he ought not to have a patent
for that, because in that case Dolbear cannot use it, -and he
says that he cannot make a telephone talk without it. And
then he says that though Bell's patent is for a method, and

OCTOBER TERI,

.%fr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

-

not for a receiver at all, yet if iDolbear uses Bell's method by
the employment of a different form of receiver for one end
of his telephone, it would be haxd indeed if he should not be
permitted to do that. Then he says that, on the whole, Reis
invented, or, at least, undertook to invent, another way of
transmitting speech, and although that way will not transmit
speech, and although he found on trial that the Reis apparatus
would not transmit speech; yet, as Reis wanted to make a
speaking telephone, and, his only trouble was that he did not
know how to, his ignorance ought not to prevent him from
being reckoned the discoverer.
Dolbear personally gets into trouble, for in 1877 he held
out Mr. Bell as -the first inventor of any speaking telephone;
then he wrote to Mr. Bell that he had modified the form, and
perhaps made some invention, himself, and he thought Mr.
Bell ought to pay him some money. Next he wrote to
Mr. Bell - for Mr. Bell did not pay him any money- that
he would publish a book which would hurt Mr. Bell, adding,
"I hope that there is nothing that I have said that would look
to you like an immoral attempt." And next he appeared in
the Dowd case as one who had sold his pretensions to that
defendant, and was set up under oath as the first inventor of
the whole speaking telephone. But when he got on the witness stand he -had to back out of all that, and now being
himself sued, he, does not even set himself up in his own
answer as a prior inventor.
The .Moleaular company says that Dolbear is mistaken, and
that IReis invented the speaking telephone, and made first-rate
speaking telephones. It is true that the Molecular experts all
swear that Reis's plan for transmitting speech'vas entirely
wrong, and that it is impossible to transmit a word by following the directions that he gave ; and that it is only by chang-2
ing the whole bperation of the instrument, and making 'it
work as Bell said for the first time in the world a telephone
ought, to be made io work,- that you can get a word through'
it. But the Molecular counsel declines to be bound by the
testimony of his own experts, and himself testifies that they.
must be wrong.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Bir. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

Then the Molecular company says: Never mind if Mr. Bell
was the first to invent a competent method; we think that as
matter of law his patent ought to be limited so as to give to
him just enough of his invention to permit him to use the tin
can and bladder instrument described in his patent, and let
everybody else use all the other forms of telephone.
The Molecular company next sees that it must account for
the fact that -when Bell produced an instrument which they
say was worthless, everybody wanted to use it; and that
when Reis produced an instrument which they say was perfect, nobody wanted to use it. But, they say, the reason is
that Reis offerea it to the world freely, and so no one would
take it; but Bell patented it, and then the community were
drawn by the attraction of theft as well as the usefulness of
the telephone. Finally they conclude that Bell never invented
a telephone at all, and never thought he did, and never meant
to, and never described one, and never intended to describe
one.

least, this is what they said up to a week ago. But now they
have discovered that Mr. Bell was not so much an inventor as
he was a thief and forger; that the "transcendent abilities"
which they say he has, and which they recognize to be quite
sufficient for the invention of the telephone, were perversely
devoted by him to the perpetration of felonies.
The Clay company say that Yarley invented the speaking
telephone. And finally they say there is not, and never was,
any such corporation as the American Bell Telephone Company, and that Bell never conveyed away his patents to any
one.

all done abroad, and! described 'inpublications by hilnself and
others, must stand on those publications as a defence to a
United States patent. But the fifty iReis publications 'all
break down; for every expert oil both sides in every case has
had to swear that it is impossible to transmit speech if you
follow those publications. Indeed, the experts have had' to
admit that the publications themselves said that Reis could
not transmit speech, and that, in prifnt, he acknowledged his
own failure. But now they repudiate that. They sent a roving conmission abroad to prove that all that Reis printed was
wrong; that all his friends printed was wrong; and that hc
really did have a speaking telephone, and knew how to transmit speech, but wrote his publications to conceal his success.
They produce as a witness Professor Sylvanus Thompson, of
England. lie wrote a book on electricity in 1880, and in that
he said that Bell was the first inventor of the speaking telephone, and IReis was not. Afterwards he was employed by
infringers to fight the Bell patent, and then he published another edition of his work, and said that he and his friend Mr.
Dolbear, who is one of the infringers, were now ready to "admit " that Bell did not invent the speaking telephone, but that
iReis did.
Then the Overland and Molecular companies sent to Germany in 1883, and took six depositions to prove that Reis invented a great deal more than he ever told of. The depositions are so absurd in themselves as to be beneath criticism ;
but the Circuit Court naturally ruled them all out as incompetent. Finally, Professor Sylvanus Thompson says the crowning point of Reis's career is found in his appearance at a certain scientific meeting at Giessen in 1864, .nd that he there
established himself as the inventor of the speaking telephone.
So they proceeded to take testimony of eye-witnesses and earwitnesses to establish that particular assertion.
Just at this juncture the Department of Justice stepped in
to aid them, and by a treaty signed by that department, and
by the Bell company, and by one of the infringing companies,
if was agreed that a commission might swiftly issue and be
sent abroad, at the joint expense of the department and the

Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

infringers, and that the testimony it brought back should be
put into one of the cases at the circuit, and in that way come
before this court, under the sanction of the Department of
Justice, and as its contribution. This was done, and those
depositions are in the record.
So they proved, if mere swearing after twenty years could
do it, that Reis had a first-rate speaking telephone at the
Giessen exhibition in 1861, and that the particular person
who experimented with him, and in whose laboratory the
exhibition was held, was the celebrated Professor Buff, now
dead. This unholy alliance had forgotten one circumstance.
On that very day, and as a part of that exhibition, Professor
Buff read a paper upon the sounds which could be produced
by means of electricity; and in that paper he described the
Reis instrument which he and Reis, within that hour, exhibited at that very meeting, and said that it 'was a -circuitbreaker, and a very ingenious one, but instead of saying that
speech was one of the sounds it could yield he said that "unfortunately it could only reproduce the pitch of musical
sounds and not their quality." That paper 'was printed at
the time. We put it into the case. It gives the verdict of
the Giessen meeting, and is Reis's death blow.
They desired also to take the deposition of Professor
Quincke, who was present at that meeting with Helmholtz
and other well-known scientific gentlemen. Professor Quincke
did not want to testify, but we consented that the other side
might put in a certain letter recently written by him stating
his recollection. Professor Quincke is dean of one of the
faculties at Heidelberg, and so we introduced the honorary
degree given last summer to iMr. Bell by the University of
inventor of
Heidelberg, on its 500th anniversary, as the #irst
the speaking telephone.'

German university within twenty miles of where Reis lived,
did his work, and, died, should pat to shame the efforts of the
Department of Justice to use the name of the United States
to induce those Germans to swear that Bell was not the first
inventor of the speaking telephone, and that their neighbor
Reis was.
Thie Gray defence. - In 1877, the Western Union Telegraph
Company determined to use Bell's telephone and test his
patent. They bought up all the pretensions of all the "prior
inventors" who had then been discovered. Many more have
since appeared, because as fast as one "prior inventor" is
spoiled, the next speculating company requires a new one.
Among others they bought up Gray and Dolbear. When
their agent Dowd was sued for infringing the Bell patent they defended the case, set up for him that Gray was
the, first inventor, and that he made his telephones under
license from. Gray. This was done in the name of the
American 8peaking Telephone Company, in which Gray and
his partner owned a third of the stock and in which Gray
was a director, while Gray was called as a witness to maintain
that defence. The Dowd case, therefore, was Gray's case,
defended by him and supported by his testimony. He there
told his story.
Gray's own pretensions rested on-a caveat which was based
on a conception first made and communicated to others and
put on paper by a sketch of February 11, 1876, then reduced
to the form of a caveat which was sworn to and filed February 14, 1876, some hours after Bell had actually filed his
application prepared, long before. Gray took part in Bell's
exhibition of his speaking telephone at the Centennial, June
24, 1876, and himself listened at Bell's instrument and heard
the applause which greeted its performance. Some days
afterwards he undertook to make an instrument as near like
his own caveat as he conveniently could, and it would not
talk a word. That-was the first instrument he ever attempted
to make for speech. He never attempted to make another
until he made a Patent Office model in IMovember, 1877, and
there is no testimony that any instrument made like the Gray

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

caveat ever did or ever can talk. As an inventor he is, therefore, necessarily out of the case, both because he never completed the invention, and because his mere conception, the
earliest date of which is February 11, 1876, was after Bell bad
fully described his invention in his specification which was
completed, signed, and sworn to on January 20, 1876, and
filed February 14, 1876.
Gray made his first appearance in the controversy on October 29, 1877, when he filed an application in the Patent Office
in the interest of the Western Union Company, and in it he
described a magneto telephone and swore that he was the first
inventor of it. In 1879, when he testified in the Dowd case,
he swore that he had never conceived of the possibility of a
,magneto telephone until he listened at Bell's magneto telephone at the Centennial, and then did not believe that it could
transmit until he had examined the wires and every detail of
the apparatus and found by personal trial that it did talk. At
that exhibition, he did not make the slightest claim that he
had ever invented the speaking telephone. In the early part
of 1877 he asserted, privately and publicly, in correspondence
with Mr. Bell and in lectures -w.ich were reported in the
newspapers, that Mr. Bell was the first inventor of the speaking telephone, and that what he, Gray, had invented was something quite different.
Thus Gray delivered a public lecture at Steinway Hall,
New York, on April 2, 1877, about his harmonic, musical,
multiple telegraph. The report in the NTew TYoro T ibune of
the next day, admitted to be true, said:
"After the first part of the programme had been executed,
Mr. Elisha Gray came forward and addressed the audience.
He was aware that great confusion existed in the public mind
as to what this telephone could perform; in particular it bad
been confounded with the speaking telephone invented by Prof.
A. Graham Bell, qf Boston. Prof. Bell, Mr. Gray said, was
present in the audience."
But when the Western Union Company were trying to
acquire a " prior inventor" for use in their expected litigation,
he appeared, in the fall of 1877 and in 1878, asserting that he
VOL. CXXVI-30

,466

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

was the sole and original inventor of the speaking telephone,
and that Bell never invented it at all. And yet he is set up
by counsel as an honest, simple-minded, guileless gentleman.
In the Dowd case, also, one defence was that the instruments of the Bell patent would not talk. But it turned out
that while Mr. Edward Renwick, who is not an electrician,
was able to make a pair that would not talk our electricians,
and afterwards Mr. Pope, the electrician of our opponents,
had not the slightest difficulty in making telephones in exact
conformity to the patent which talked perfectly well. That
ended the defence that figure 7 of the Bell patent was not a
talking telephone.
The Western Union Company had spent two years' time,
with'all its wealth and resources, hunting this country and
Europe for a defence. But when this testimony was taken
aid printed, the late Mr. George Gifford advised them that
the courts would always find that Bell was the inventor of
the speaking telephone and that he had a good patent for it.
They thereupon surrendered and submitted to a decree against
them. The whole story is told by Mr. Gifford under oath, and
is in the record. No judgment of a court could be more persuasive than the surrender of such a corporation, under the
advice of such counsel, after such a preparation.
The defendants here were forced to meet this. They attempted to do it by asserting that the whole proceeding was a
sham, and that it was the Bell Company, and not the Western
Union that surrendered. To this one answer is that the record.
contains the whole story, told by -Mr. Gifford himself under
oath, and no man contfadicts it; another is that the facts of
the history are that the spoils of victory remained with the
Bell Company and not with the Western Union Company. If
the Gray pretensions had been well founded, the Western
Union Company could have had a patent for the whole speaking telephone, and Bell would have nothing. The Western
Union also owned the inventions of Edison, Page, and others
in the nature of improvements or accessories of vast importance. Against this the Bell company had chiefly to rely
on the Bell invention. The settlement between the two par-

ties was that while it was recognized, both in language and by
financial result, that the Bell patent was valid and controlled
the profits of the business, yet that the subsidiary inventions
of Edison, Page, and others owned by the Western Union
were of some value; that they should be put into the hands
of the Bell company to use; and that the Western Union
should have such proportion of the total proceeds as might
represent the value of these subsidiary patents. It was agreed
that one-fifth of the proceeds corresponded to that value, and
that was what they received.
The alleged fraud on Gay, and the proceedings at the
Patent Office.-The files show the following state of facts:
Mr. Bell's application was filed on February 14, 1876. On
February 19, Wilber, the examiner, wrote to Pollok & Bailey,
Bell's solicitors, a regular official letter, signed by the Commissioner, copied into the files, stating that the first, fourth, and
fifth claims related to matters described in a pending caveat;
that the caveator had been notified; and that Bell's application was suspended for ninety days, as required by law. To
this Messrs. Pollok & Bailey replied, by an offical letter in the
files, addressed to the Commissioner, requesting him to determine whether or not the application was filed prior to the
caveat. They wrote : 'I.We have inquired the date of* filing
the caveat, inasmuch as we are entitled to the knowledge, and
find it to be February 14, 1876, the same day on which our
application was filed. If our application was filed earlier in
the day than was the caveat, then there is no warrant for theaction taken by the office." They requested an examination
into the facts, stating that the application was filed early in
the day, and was signed and sworn to on the 20th of January.
Examiner Wilber, before whom this letter first came, refused
the request, insisting that if the two papers were filed on the
same day they were to be considered as filed at the same time,
and asserting that such was the practice of the office; and he
refused to dissolve the interference. Yet it is charged that he
was our tool and.confederate and did everything we asked.
The matter was taken to the Commissioner in person, and
he filed a written decision that the exact time of the filing of

'court has since settled that such is the law. .ouisvillev. Sav'ngs Bank, 104 U. S. 469, 418. Thereupon Examiner Wilber
officially decided and indorsed on the papers, that the Patent
Office records showed that the application was filed in the
clerk's office before the caveat, and that the application
reached his room by noon of the 14th, and the caveat not
until the next day. Everything that a hostile examiner could
do against Mr. Bell, Wilber had done.
Turn now to the file of Gray's caveat, which is in the case.
On February 19, 1876, the office sent a letter to him in the
usual official form, saying that an application had been filed.
which appeared to interfere with his caveat; and he was invited to complete his specification as the law required. But in.
addition to that, Wilber wrote to Gray on the same day,
another letter which is also in the files, stating the particulars
in which the application conflicted with the caveat, and giving
to Gray substantial copies of Mr. Bell's three most important
claims, including the fifth claim for the speaking telephone.
This was very wrong, for Gray had still three months in
which" to prepare and file his specification, and in that he
could insert anything he pleased. To tell him beforehand the
precise claims of Bell's application, which ought to have been
kept secret, was not only a violation of the examiner's duty,
but it was giving to Gray very unfair advantage, if he had
been minded to make use of it. And yet they say that Wilber was our tool, working entirely in our interest. The letter
turns out to be very valuable for us, for it shows that on that
very day Wilber the examiner knew that Bell's specification
was for a speaking telephone just as much as the caveat was.
Gray personally received the notice, but chose not to proceed.
He -was wise, for he knew that his caveat was not written
until Monday, February 14, while Bell's long specification,
filed on that day, was necessarily written a good while previously. Indeed it was sworn to on January 20th.
The situation of these two men at that time offered a great
contrast. Gray had foi" a partner Mr. Samuel S. White, of

Philadelphia, a wealthy manufacturer, devoted to patents;
and Gray himself had the advantage of all the resources of the
largest electrical machine shop in the country, of which he
had until recently been superintendent. Mr. Bell, on the
other hand, was absolutely destitute of means. Mr. Hubbard,
who afterwards became his father-in-law, had agreed to help
him about a multiple telegraph, but took no interest in the
telephone, would advance no money about it, and objected to
Bell's spending any time on it. That was not unnatural, for
Mr. Bell had not constructed a practically useful speaking telephone, and Mr. Hubbard did not believe that he would make.
one. Thus all the attraction which wealthy surroundings
could offer to a dishonest official were on the side of Gray,
and the -c -rd of what Examiner Wilber- did, showed that so
far from alaing Mr. Bell he did everything he could to'thwart
him.
In 1879 came the Dowd case, which was Gray's case. Under his direction, his agent Dowd set up that Gray was the
first inventor, and that Bell had "surreptitiously obtained a
patent for that which Gray had first invented." That was the
issue, and Gray went on the stand to support it. But that defence necessarily broke down, for Gray testified in that controversy that the first date he could assign rested on a sketch
which he made on Friday, February 11, 1876, and which he
turned into his caveat written on Monday, February 14, 1876.
Now Nfr. BelPs application showed on its face (and it was so
proved) that it was completed, sent to Washington, copied in
Washington by Mr. Pollok's clerk, got back to Boston, and
there, in its finished condition, was signed and sworn to on
January. 20, 1876, and was again in Washington in the hands
of Mr. Pollok to be filed, before Gray made his first sketch of
February 11, 1876. When these facts were established, Mr.
Gifford naturally knew that the Western Union Company and
Gray could not prevail against Mr. Bell.
The question of Gray's standing against Bell again came up
to trial in New Orleans in 1886, on new testimony from Mr.
Gray and on testimony from Wilber, both offered by our opponents after the Department of Justice had begun its assaults

on us. The court there decided that "the fact that Bell's invention certainly dates from January 20, 1876, and that it.
covers a speaking telephone, renders it unnecessary to pass
upon the evidence relating to the tergiversations and claims of
Gray; the alleged frauds of Bell in advancing his application
for a patent; the illegal conduct and conflicting statements of
Examiner Wilber; and many alleged vices and irregularities,
the evidence of which forms the bulk of the record, and apparently the main defence in the case.
At the same time it is
proper to say that in all the evidence we have found nothing
that shows that Bell has done or caused to be done anything
inconsistent with his right to be called an honest man, with
clean hands."
The papers themselves now on file in the-office, show that
anything that Wilber might swear to as to the transactions
between himself and Mr. Bell, if he ever should swear to anything improper, would necessarily be as foolish in law as false
in fact, because Mr. Bell could not have stolen anything from
Gray and put it into his patent, inasmuch as the specification,
as finally issued in the patent, is exactly the specification
which Bell wrote and swore to three weeks before Gray's
caveat existed, - with the exception of a mere formal explanatory amendment, which the courts have always decided was
pure surplusage, and which did not change by a single letter
any part of the application which described or claimed the
speaking telephone. Therefore a new fraud theory had to be
invented to get" rid of these stubborn facts. It is this new
theory which was started last week for the first time in the
world. The charge which it makes is competent as a matter
of evidence, for it is a charge that Bell did not make the invention, but stole it, or an important part ,of it, from Gray.
That charge is set up in the answer of the Drawbaugh and
Overland companies, and they have a right to argue in support of it. The new story is that Mr. Bell honestly and originally invented and described in his application the magneto
speaking teldphone, Fig. 7, and out of his own head drew the
fifth claim, - which that description is sufficient to sustain, all exactly as it now stands in the patent. But the specifica,

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

tion also indicates that the particular transmitting member the magneto transmitter - shown in Fig. 7, can be replaced by
what is now called a variable resistance liquid transmitter,
and that the apparatus thus modified will still transmit speech
because as a whole it will still embody the novel principle
described as the essential element in Fig. 7 and specified in the
fifth claim, the only claim sued on. The charge is that this
alternative form of the transmitting member was not invented
by Mr. Bell; that Gray invented it and described it in his caveat
of February 14, 1876; that Examiner Wilber of the Patent
Office, who received the caveat on February 15, dishonestly
and corruptly showed it to Bell's solicitors, and that the
knowledge thus obtained was written into Bell's application
after it was filed, by despoiling and altering the files by a
species of forgery.
Their precise averment is that Bell's application as filed
February 14, 1876, though it had Fig. 7 and the description
of it, and claim 5, did not have the liquid transmitter part,
nor claim 41 which specifically refers to that.
We know that on February 19 it did have them, because an
-official letter written on that day by the Patent Office to Mr.
Bell, and another official letter written on the same day to
Mr. Gray, state in terms that the application has them. Their
hypothesis is that between February 15 and February 19, or
thereabouts, Wilber delivered the Gray caveat, not to Mr.
Bell, who was not in Washington, but to his solicitors Messrs.
Pollok and Bailey; that Pollok and Bailey had to act instantly, because, say our opponents, while their tool Wilber
insisted upon giving them the caveat, he would not delay that
act twenty-four hours until Mr. Bell could be summoned from
Boston to profit by it. So Pollok and Bailey, unable to wait
for Bell, and having possession of the Gray caveat, stole Bell's
application also, and cut out from it a number of sheets and
forged new ones into which they wrote the liquid transmitter
which they stole from Gray's caveat, and interpolated these
into Bell's application, and then put those dishonest forged
papers all back in the files. Nothing of this can touch Mr.
Bell personally, because he was not in Washington at all in
1876 until February 26. That is the charge so far.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
M r. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.
-They say that the liquid transmitter must have got into
Bell's specification by unintelligent copying, because Gray's.
caveat said that the liquid for a liquid transmitter must be
water or some "d i gA resistance" liquid, whereas Bell's patent
speciffes "mercury or some other liquid." Now, say. our
opponents, any one capable of making the invention, and, still
more so accomplished an electrician as Mr. Bell, would not
have written that, because he would have known that a liquid
transmitter cannot work with mercury, which is a fluid of
very low resistance. This, they say, proves that the description must have been interpolated by persons as ignorant as
they say Messrs. Pollok and Bailey were; though why ignorant men, if copying, should have varied the liquid, no one
explAins.
But this whole argument rests upon a false basis of fact,
and when the true scientific fact is 'known, it absolutely disproves the charge. With the particular form and arrangement dccribed by Gray a high resistance fluid is essential,
but with a different arrangement of the working parts of the
liquid transmitter, mercury or some low resistance liquid not
only can be used but makes a far better liquid transmitter
than can be made with water, on Gray's plan. The tyro,
stealing and copying from Gray's description and explanation,.
would have thought that water was the only available liquid;
but Mr. Bell, being neither a tyro nor a thief, inventing the
thing himself, perceived that a peculiar arrangement of parts
with a low resistance fluid was the best plan. He made all
his liquid transmitters in that way,- both his first, completed
and successfully used on March 10, 1876, and his liquid transmitter exhibited at the Centennial in Tune, 1876,- employing
mercury or acidulated water (low resistance liquids) in all.
So it happens, not only that the liquid transmitter described
in Bell's patent is very different from that of Gray, but it is.
so far different that nobody except an original'inventor could
have thought it out. It could not have been copied from
Gray.
The two official letters of February 19 show that it was in
the specification'on that day. Bell, who was not in Wash-

TELEPECONE CASES.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

ington until February 26, could not have written it in between
February 15 and February 19; while the solicitors could not
have done it, for it was necessarily the work of an original
inventor of some brilliancy. It must therefore have been in
the specification as originally written by Bell and filed February 14, before the caveat existed.
[Mr. Dickerson then explained vhat he insisted was a very
grievous defect in the Gray plan of the liquid transmitter,
but avoided by the Bell plan.]
The hypothesis of my opponents, as they state it, is based,
and necessarily based, upon the theory, that Wilber, the examiner, was the guilty confederate of Bell; yet it at once has
to encounter the fact that instead of issuing the patent in the
usual course, the first thing Wilber did was, on February- 19,
to suspend the application for three months, inform Gray of
its contents, and invite Gray to raise an interference and
contest Bell's claim. These letters are in the files, and Gray
testified that he got the notice. When Bell's solicitors protested, and appealed to the Commissioner in writing, Wilber'
again resisted them, and only yielded when the Commissioner
formally overruled him by a written opinion filed February 25.
One or two days after February 25, Mr. Bell came to
Washington, and my opponents give a very circumstantial
hypothesis of what they say might have happened. As soon
as he arrived, his solicitors told him, so the hypothesis runs,
of the forgeries they had committed in his behalf, and he
went into the office to admire what they had done. But he
wanted an active part in the crime. So, finding the application
all fair-written in ink, he, with his pencil, interpolated by pencil
interlineation a number of words. Their hypothesis and line
of argument, if sound at all, show exactly what was interlined.
Upon examination, however, we are startled to find that each
of those supposed changes would have injured the patent so
far as it could have had any effect at all. He thus, according
to their theory, mutilated his specification thirty-eight times.
Their supposed proof of this is as follows:
Mr. Bell completed an early draft of his specification in
November, 1875. There is in the record a copy or duplicate

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

of that draft, made at that time to be given to Mr. George
Brown, and known as the George Brown draft. This Gebrge
Brown copy, the body of which is not in Mr. Bell's handwriting, shows very few emendations by him. Essentially it represents the proposed specification as it was when this early copy
was made. The patent as issued differs from that copy of the
early draft in thirty-eight passages. Obviously this may be
because between November, 1875, when that duplicate was
made, and the completion of the specification on January 20,
1876, Mr. Bell revised and improved his own copy of the draft.
But the argument of my opponents is (and this is the essential
basis of their hypothesis) that the actual specification filed
February 14, 1876, Written of course in ink, was exactly like
the George Brown draft, and that the emen dations were introduced by pencil cancellations and interlineations fraudulently
made by MNr. Bell on that paper, in the Patent Office between
February 27 and February 29, 1867.
If we could look at that very paper we could tell what was
fair-written in ink, and whether there are any pencil interlineations, and if so what they are. My opponents say that there
exists a fac-simile of that paper, with the fair-written ink words
of the original regularly written in ink in the fac-simile, and
the alleged pencil interlineations of the original written in
pencil between the lines in the fac-simile. There was put in
evidence and printed in the Dowd case in 1879 (finding its
way thence into these cases by reprinting) a certified copy,
certified April 10, 1879, and both sides agree that it is the
usual habit of the Patent Office to make its copies of specifications in the manner of fac-similes. My opponents assume that
that paper (on file in the Circuit Court in Boston, and now in
the hands of the Chief Justice and known as the Boston exhibit) is such a fac-simile, and their argument about the interlineations is based on its present condition. Assuming their
ground, that paper will test their hypothesis. If the fairwritten ink words of that paper are the words of the Brown
specification, and the pencil words are the new words which
are in the patent but not in the Brown paper, their theory
may be true, and the paper would give great support to it.

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

On the other hand, if the ink words of that paper are the
words of the patent, then it is certain that the emendations
which converted the early draft of November, 1875, into the
exact language of the patent in Mr. Bell's draft, were made
before his solicitor's clerk, copying from that amended draft,
made the paper which actually was fled. That is, those
emendations were honestly made before the application was
filed, and not dishonestly afterwards.
They did not produce the Boston exhibit. They read what
purports to be a printed copy of it, printed in the Dowd case,
and reprinted in the other cases from the Dowd print. That
contains both sets of words printed regularly in the same line
thus: "may be used to signify indicate," 1 and does not tell
which of the duplicate words, "used" or "made," "signify"
or "indicate," are the words in ink and which are the words
interlined in pencil in that exhibit. The clerk of the Circuit
Court has produced the exhibit, which is examined by this
court under a stipulation made a year ago, and that shows
it. Here is a fac-simile of one paragraph of that original
Boston exhibit.

This tells the story. Now in every instance in that exhibit
the fair-written ixk words, as "used" and "indicate," "may
be indicated" are the words of the patent, and the interlined
words (which are in pencil) are the words of the older George
Brown draft. The ink part is confessedly a copy of the ink
part of the original application. The paper may have got into
its present condition in consequence of some one, at some time,
I See p. 250, supra.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

for some reason, interlining on that very paper (Boston exhibit)
the George Brown words with a pencil; but neither it nor any
paper of which it is a fac-simile (if in all parts it is a fac-simile)
were produced by taking an ink copy of the George Brown
draft and interlining the ultimate words of the patent. The
.very evidence they produce, when we look at the exhibit itself
instead of the badly printed copy they rely on, destroys their
whole charge.
As this charge .was never made nor thought of until last
week, it would be strange if the record showed how these
interlineations got on to the Boston exhibit - Whether they
were put there by the Patent Office, as a copy of the original,
or whether they were put there afterwards in pencil by some
one who was comparing the application with the older George
Brown draft, and got printed by mistake' It happens, however, that we know. A year ago, (February 18, 1886,) one of
the counsel for the Bell company noticed this Dowd print and
wrote to the counsel, for the Drawbaugh company:
" The copy of the application is not printed correctly. I
believe there are no errors in it which are of any importance,
but there are some pencil marks on the copy that went to the
printer in the Dowd case, with brackets, etc., and that got
reproduced in ygur case."
This statement was accepted as correct, and by written
stipulation the application was reprinted without those errors
and the reprint put into the record. It was alsb.agreed that
this court "for goreater certainty " might look at the original.
On this correspondence and stipulation, those pencil marks
must be taken as.pencil marks accidentally made on that exhibit after it left the Patent Office.
My opponents did not refer to the Boston exhibit itself, but
they found one other fact hard to encounter. The application in the Patent Office files to-day is fair-written in ink, exactly in the words of the patent, and without any trace of
pencil interlineation. That record fact was fatal to the hypothesis of different ink words and pencil amendments in the
original on file. They promptly met it by asserting that if
their hypothesis and the official record were inconsistent, the

TELEPHONE GASES.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

record must have been forged. So, to support the hypothesis
of one forgery they offer the hypothesis of another. Indeed,
they assert that it is easier to believe two forgeries than one.
They say in their brief :
"Crime breeds crime. A foul deed perpetrated in silence
and secrecy draws around a man an invisible line that separates him from his fellows. He is thenceforth set apart as the
especial victim of circumstances. He is arrayed in a neverending but unequal conflict with the terrible Nemesis of retribution. The stern necessity is laid upon him of unceasing
vigilance, of daring unscrupulousness, and of reckless effrontery in the commission of further offences; for only thus can
he stave off the inevitable end. Mr. Bell, notwithstanding
his transcendent intellectual abilities, proves no exception to
the rule. There is evidence in this record, ample, complete
and demonstrative, that subsequent to the 10th day of April,
1879, a crime of the most atrocious character was committed
in the Patent Office of Washington; that this was- done for
the sole purpose of covering up and concealing the evidence
existing in that office of crime previously perpetrated there in
February, 1876, as already outlined."
So, say they, when the certified copy of April 10, 1879, produced in the Dowd case in 187 9, informed Bell that the paper
in the Patent Office exhibited the ink words and the supposed
pencil Interlineations, supposed proof of his supposed guilt,
Nemesis told him that all trace of those alterations must be
suppressed. So they say that Mr. Bell, having seen these interlineations in the Boston exhibit in 1879, went or sent to the
Patent Office and stole the whole file in order to conceal the
proof of his guilt furnished by the pencil interlineations, and
substituted a new, clean one, in place of it, and that that is
the one there now. The one there now, they say, is the
result of this second forgery and substitution.
There are fatal difficulties even on the surface of this view. If
Mr. Bell's object was to conceal the interlineations of the Boston
copy, nobody can explain why he voluntarily, on the witness
stand, as part of his own deposition, produced that very copy
and put it into the Dowd case and had it printed and published.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1887.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

Yet that is what he did. And nobody could explain how he
could hope to take away the much marked and interlined file
of that patent, which they say was one of the best known
papers in the Patent Office, examined by a great niany people
from1 curioSity, and substitute a new, different and perfectly
clean one, and expect that it would escape detection. Their
hypothesis (loes not attempt to account for these facts.
Our opponents tried to bolster ipthis fraud charge, and the
oharge that Wilber, who in fact did everything he could to
hinder and stop Bell from getting a patent, was nevertheless
Bell's tool, by reading a letter written by Mr. Bell a year previously about another application he had in the Patent Office.
In that letter, Mr. 3ell, speaking of a harmonic multiple telegraph invention as to which he was about to come in conflict
with Mr. Gray, wrote to his father and mother that he was
just filing his application for it, and that his lawyers were
doubtful whether the examiner would even declare an interference between him and Gray, " as Gray's-apparatus had been
there for so long a time." On that they argue that Wilber,
the examiner, was even then their tool and showed them Gray's
apparatus and told them it had been there a long time. The
hoitl,had not
fact, however, turns out to be that Gray's a
been there forty-eight hours, but that Gray's a2 ppratus had
been described in a number of newspapers for several months,
and had been - not on file in the Patent Office but - on public exhibition in many places, including the public hall in the
Patent Office. That was the fact which Mr. Bell referred to
in his letter, by the phrase "as Gray's apparatus had been
there for so long a time."
They next ask the court to judge Mr. Bell by his subsequent
conduct. They say that if there was no fraud perpetrated oA
Mr. Gray in the Patent Office in 1876, Mr. Bell might be
expected to honestly state to the world the subsequent history
of his experiments and inventions, and1 that whether he did so
or not would be a good test of his honesty at the outset. Thereupon they assert that he suppressed the fact that a few days
after he got his patent he made his first liquid transmitter and
got speech with itg and that this was only wrung from him

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

years afterwards on cross-examination. I agree that his conduct is a good test, but it was exactly the contrary of what
they aver. Instead of concealing the liquid transmitter, he
within sixty days, in May, 1876, described it in a public lecture, printed the lecture at once, and sent a copy of it to Mr.
Gray (whom he knew as an electrical inventor and his rival in
harmonic telegraphy), and Mr. Gray testifies that he received
it. He exhibited the instrument at the Centennial in the
summer of 1876. Again, in his interference proceeding with
Gray, in his preliminary statement, made in 1878 and printed
in this record, he voluntarily told Gray, the Patent Office and
the world that he made his first liquid transmitter in Boston
on March 10, 1876, three days after his patent; and that statement has been before the community and before all the parties
in all the cases for nine years.
In truth their own "Nemesis seems to inspire the authors
of this charge. They assert an infamous crime, and when
every official record disproves it they reply that every record
must have been forged. The Boston exhibit they rely on disproves the forgery, so they offer a misprinted copy of it, and
they suppress or misstate the subsequent conduct which they
say would prove or disprove the charge..
TMe George Brown &pecifation.- Mr. Bell wished in 1875
to take out English patents at the same time as his American
patents. He had no money, and Mr. Hubbard would not
assist him in England. But the Hon. George Brown, of
Toronto, a friend of his family, became interested in him,
and chiefly as a matter of friendship agreed to take put
English patents for him, and pay the expenses on certain
terms. So he was to take all of Mr. Bell's specifications to
England, which country he was about to visit. The inventions which he thus expected to patent were not the speaking
*elephone alone, but all Mr. Bell's electrical inventions, which
were put into five long specifications, chiefly filled "With the
multiple telegraph. Mr. Bell was so much in _need of means
of subsistence that Mr. Brown agreed to allow him twentyfi-e dollars a month for his support for six months, while the
patents were being taken out. As soon as Mr. Brown ex-

OCTOBER TERI,

Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

pressed his willingness to make this agreement, (September,
1875,) Mr. Bell went -to work on his specifications, and his
work resulted in one draft which he used for his American
specification, and another draft which he gave to Mr. Brown
to take abroad. The use which our opponents make of these
drafts which are in -the record, is this: They find - and such
is the fact -that the liquid transmitter and the thirty-eight
other words already referred to, are not in the George Brown
specifications taken abroad. They say, arguendo (and this
inference was never hinted at-till a week ago) that the American specification as filed was probably the same as the George
Brown specification; -and therefore they conclude, arguendo,
that .the American specification as filed did not have a liquid
transmitter in it. If that be the fact, then the liquid transmitter which is now in there must have been put in afterwards,- and, therefore, by forgery.
To. begin with there are two answers which of themselves
dispose of this. One is that the liquid transmitter part of the
application and patent is not of importance. Figure 7 (the
magneto speaking telephone) and tne description-of it which
is in both papers, contains the whole broad invention and
embodies the broad general principle. The broad fifth claim
rests equally well on that instrument and description, whether
the liquid transmitter be described in the applicatioli oz not.
The liquid transmitter is merely an alternative form in the
nature of an improvement. It might be put in or left out of
the patent without any legal consequences. Indeed, they
argue that the description of the liquid transmitter in the
patent is so vague and imperfect that the law cannot read it,
and must. treat the specification as if it were not there. Moreover, as an instrument, it is of a form which of itself is not of
the-slightest practical importance, for it is too inconvenient to
be used. A second answer is that there is written proof that
Mr. Bell invented the plan of producing his articulating current by variations of resistance, which is the particular subordinate principle employed in-a liquid transmitter, ten months
before he took his patent, and nine months before Gray began
to think of the subject, for in a letter of May 4, 1875, printed

TELEPHONE CASES.
Air. Dickerson's Argument for American- Bell Telephone Co.

in the record, he mentions the plan of varying the resistance
as an improved means of transmitting speech by electricity.
So this resort to the hypothesis of theft and forgery leads -to
the conclusion (and to no other conclusion) that Bell stole from
Gray's caveat that which is of no legal or practical value, and
the essential idea of which Bell in substance had and described
in writing nine months before Gray's caveat was thought of.
The history of these papers is as follows: Mr. Bell made a
draft of his specification in the fall of 1875, immediately after
his first negotiations with Mr. Brown, in September, and he
made at least two copies of it. On December 26, 1875, at
Toronto, he made his final contract in writing with Mr.
Brown, and immediately went back to Boston and sent a
copy of all his specifications to Mr. Brown, in6luding one of
the two drafts of the speaking telephone specifications. He
kept on working on the other draft which he had retained in
order to send to his patent solicitor in Washington, and, during the month of January, 1876, the idea of the variable resistance transmitter again came into his mind, but now in the
form of the liquid transmitter, which he then and there wrote
into the draft of his American specification. This, we say,
was after the George Brown specification had gone to Canada;
and that is the reason why that feature is in the American
specification and not in the George Brown specification.
That the paper for Washington was revised, and that the
other was left untouched after the two copies were first made,
is a fact proved in the case. The two papers probably were
once identical, or nearly so. But the specification filed at
Washington (as shown by the present file and by the copies
already referred to) differs from the Brown specification in
thirty-eight passages. Most of these differences are of no
legal importance, and consist in the substitution of simpler
and more concise or more happy words and phrases in the
American specification, showing that in its present form it
was the result of studious revision bestowed upon that particular paper after' the time when the two were identical, and
that, for some reason, these emendations were never transferred to the George Brown paper.VOL. cxxv-31

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

But, say they, Mr. Bell met Mr. Brown in New York on
the 25th of January, 1876, the day before the latter sailed,
and if he then had the liquid transmitter, in his American
specification, why did he not write it into the copy that MrBrown had? It is not difficult to understand why. MrBrown, as a kind and friendly act, was going to take out.
patents on all the electrical inventions Bell had made - contained in five long specifications, with the speaking telephoner
tacked on to the last end of the last of them. That particular
invention had not assumed importance in Mr. Brown's eyes,.
because Mr. Bell had told him that his practical success with
that instrument was insignificant, and Mr. Brown, a busy man
and a newspaper editor, without the knowledge to appreciate:
the scientific perfection of the invention, did not realize that.
anything would ever practically come of it. The multiple.
telegraph, which would send many messages at one time anc
was in a working form, was what he wanted. Any one not.
a man of high science, and not capable of appreciating the.
scientific perfection of Mr. Bell's ideas, would have said at
once that he dismissed the muttering thing, as Mr. GeorgeBrown did, and paid no attention to it. So, when they met
in New York, just as Mr. Brown was sailing, Mr. Bell did not
attempt to correct the prp'ers. Probably they were at the
bottom of Mr. Brown's trunk, and Mr. Bell did not see them.
We know that none of the thirty-eight emendations were
transferred to them. Mr. Brown took the papers with him
to Eurozo; never patented anything; brought them all back;
and when the controversy began he returned them to Mr.
Bell, and Mr. Bell himself voluntarily put them in evidence
as part of his own deposition. Yet they want you to believe
that those papers, voluntarily offered by Mr. Bell, contained,
and that Mr.-Bell knew they contained, positive proof of his,
forgery.
I said that Mr. Bell sent the specifications to Toronto toMr. Brown in the first two or three days of January, 1876,
and did not put the liquid transmitter in his American specification until a week or ten days later. Mr. Hill's brief, p. 217,
says, "the American specification was comtleted between

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickerson's Araltment for American Bell Telephone Co.

January 1 and January 10, 1876," Mlr. Bell having testified
that it was about January 10 when he sent his draft to his
solicitor in *Washington. That that was the time when he
put it into his American specification is sufficiently fixed by
the testimony. That the papers went into Mr. Brown's hands
in the first few days of January is not specifically sworn.
Mr. Bell testifies that it was between the date of his contract,

December 26, 1875, and the 25th of January, the day when
Mr. Brown was in New York to sail. We had no occasion
to verify the precise date when the papers went, or how they
went to Mr. Brown -whether handed to him in person or
put into his hands through the mail, -because no conflict ever
arose in the case which made the precise fact imliortant. But
whatever I do or do not know outside the record, I am at
least at liberty to suggest this explanation; and it is vastly
more likely that Mr. Bel, having made the contract with
Mr. Brown, and knowing that Mr. Brown was immediately
to sail for Europe, rushing back himself to Boston, should at
once have sent him the specification which he had prepared,
than that he could have gone on committing forgery after
forgery, and then should himself voluntarily, and in his own
deposition, put into all the cases, and lay before all his adversaries, the very papers which they say he knew proved his
fraud.
All the tecord proof is conclusive in our favor. All the
positive testimony is conclusive in our favor. The sole argument on the other side is that if we do not fortify the record
proof by the inferior proof from recollection on points which
no one has ever questioned, the court must asquino that we
forged the record.

Six weeks after Mrr. Bell had got his patent McDonough filed

"prior inventor." He has been enjoined. His case has been
decided against him in the Patent Office, after a long litigation, and in the courts. He is a copyist of Reis; that is the
end of his pretension.
The Tarley patent.- Varley made a multiple harmonic telegraph, and patented it as such, in terms, in 1870. Nobody
pretends that speech can be transmitted by that apparatus
however operated,.or by any instrument possessing the mode
of operation which Varley describes. But he used the word
"undulation" once in his patent, and Mr. Bell uses the word
"undulation "; and the current produced by every dynamo
machine since dynamo machines were made, may in a sense
have the adjective "undulatory" applied to it. That is the resemblance, and the only.resemblance, between these three contrivances. You might say that it proves, that all of them
were dynamo machines. The Clay company says that it
proves that all- of them were speaking telephones. That is
the whole argument about Varley.
The .Holcomb defence, and the Hlouse patents as defences
are specifically abandoned by Mr. Lowrey, counsel for the
Molecular company, in his brief, and no one insists on them.
Holcomb made a Morse telegraph relay, and patented it as
such in 1865. He tries to swear it into a speaking telephone,
but the Circuit Court found his story false. House made an
improved Morse telegraph relay, and patented it as such in
one form in 1865 and in another form May 12, 1868, and both
patents are in the case. But it can no more transmit speech
when performing the kind of operation his patent describes
than a Morse telegraph can.
The graphic representation of electrical currents.-I
wish
to explain the usual symbolical representations of electric
currents. Here at AB is the ordinary representation of a
"broken" current, - a succession of dashes or dots, as may be,
separated by spaces. That total length from A to B does not
represent a line wire, or symbolize a line wire with little fragments of electricity travelling along it one after another like
successive drops. The length of line occupied by these dots
and dashes represents time; not space or distance. This rep-

485

resentation symbolizes the idea by the methods of analytical
geometry.
It means, assuming that the whole distance AB represents
a minute or any other unit of time, that for so much of that
period of time as is represented by the length of one dash
compared with the length of the whole distance, the current
is flowing; not flowing over a little -piece of the wire, but
flowing over the whole wire for that short period of time.
Then there comes a second period of time when there is no
current anywhere on the line-wire, and the length of that
period is represented by the length of the blank space. Then
again a third period of time when there is a current over all
parts of the wire, and so on.

We can go a little further than that. When we have Mr.
Bell's undulatory current, which consists essentially of a cmrent flowing continually (or without breaks unless they are so
infinitely short that we consider it as flowing all the time), but
varying in its strength, we can express it by a block with a
level base and a curved upper edge.
CD, in the lower part of the foregoing diagram, represents
such a current. The strength of the current at any one instant is represented by a line equal to the perpendicular
height (the dotted line) from a particular part of the curve to
the base line; at another instant the strength of the current
is represented by the length of a line which extends from
another part of the curve to the base line. This figure does
not mean that the current is thrown into a succession of
waves, ten, or twenty, or thirty, on a wire like the waves of
the sea; it means, for all practical purposes, on any lines used

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

in telephony, that the current through the whole wire is, in
all parts of it, of a certain strength at one instant, and that at
another successive instant, it is either weaker or stronger, as
the case may be. For example, if the lengths 0 E, E F, F G,
&c., represent seconds of time, then the strength of the current at the end of the first second would be represented by
the length of the dotted line E; at the end of the second
second by the length of the dotted line F, and so on. The
parts at MAr,
N, 0 indicate by the frequent -changes in the
curve that the current changes its strength very frequently,
and in -a very irregular manner. This diagram, therefore, is
not a picture of anything that exists, but is a symbolical
statement of an ideT, or of a succession of measurements of
.the strength of the current taken at successive instants.
Thus time, and not space or distance, is symbolized by the
lengths A B or 0 D in both cases, and the dimensions or shape
.of the blocks or of the curve express either that for a certain
length of time there is a current and then none, as at A B,
or there is always some current, but for one length of time
stronger, and afterwards weaker, as at C D.
The "S)urious Brood" of decisions.- The defendants say
that all the decisions of the circuit courts in the cases ar'e a
"spurious brood," resting on an "assumed decision" of Judge
Lowell in Spencer's case, based, they say, upon an unwise, if
not a dishonest admission. In Spencer's case Judge Lowell
said that Bell "is admitted in this case to be the original and
first inventor of any mode of transmitting speech electrically."
That was "admitted" by Professor Henry Morton, the defendants' principal expert in tnat case, on the witness stand. Professor Henry Morton again comes on the stand as an expert
witness for the Overland and Molecular companies, and repeats what he said in Spencer's case. Every other expert witness for the defence in any of these cases agrees that no mode
for transmitting speech is described in any publication or any
patent before Bell's patent (this is what Professor Morton and
Judge Lowell were talking about), and all the judges have
agreed with Judge Lowell. In the Molecular case, Judge
Wallace said that the additional testimony of Professors

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

Young ind Brackett, experts for the Molecular and Overland
companies, only served to confirm Judge Lowell's opinion that
Reis did not invent the speaking telephone. The attack they
make on the decisions is therefore disproved by every expert
who has ever testified on either side in any of these cases.
Breadth of the invention and of the patent.- The whole argument in this case can be shortly illustrated. Galileo made
a telescope by combining-two well-known forms of lenses with
each other in a certain manner, by which the eye was enabled
to see at unnatural distances, just as the ear is enabled to hear
at unnatural distances by Bell's telephone. His telescope was
not so good as you can now buy for twenty-five cents of a
street pedlar; and the lenses of which he made it could be
bought in shops at his time. But what he did was to fasten
these two lenses in such relation to each other that, according
to the law of God he discovered, they constituted a telescope.
It distorted the things that he looked at, but for the first time
it brought them near. If he had taken out a patent for it, he
might have made for it this claim: "What I claim is a method
of and apparatus for seeing telescopically, by causing the undulations of light to be converged upon the retina, substantially as described." That paraphrase of Mr. Bell's fifth claim
would be a good claim for that telescope.
Then ingenious men made vast improvements which enabled
their telescopes to do what Galileo's never could have done,
and they have reached the great Lick telescope in California.
If my opponents could examine that telescope to-day with
Galileo, what would they tell him about it ? They would acknowledge that it is a telescope because it has objective and
eye-piece lenses put in that relation to each other which Galileo first thought out. But Dolbear would say that Galileo's
patent discloses the only method possible for seeing telescopically, and that method, strange to say, does not defy -he laws
of nature, but conforms to them; and therefore the patent
ought to be void. At any rat , says Dolbear, the objective of
the Lick telescope is made out of two pieces of glass, -- one
of crown and one of flint glass,- instead of one, as Galileo's
was, and therefore I ought to have leave to use Galileo's dis-

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Ir. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

covery if I will make my lens of two different kinds of glass
instead of one.
Then comes the Molecular company, and they say that they
are willing that Galileo should keep the bad telescope he made
in his lifetime, and they will admit that he is the first inventor of that, or of any telescope, if he will only permit them
and all other persons to "have access to the universal storehouse" through the door which he found and opened.
Then come the Overland and the Drawbaugh companies,
and they say that Galileo never invented anything, but was
only a thief and a forger. Indeed, they point to the fact that
he was cast into prison; and a man who has done all that
ought to have his patent taken away and be sent to the penitentiary.
And yet that great Lick telescope reveals the utmost secrets
of the universe, because it follows that law of nature and that
rule which Galileo laid down and embodied in the arrangement of his two bits of glass.
The Drawbaugh case. - The chief part of the appellant's
argument on this is simply an assertion that the decision of the
Circuit Court consists of astounding misstatements of proved
facts. The first instance asserted is that Judge Wallace found
that Drawbaugh wrote his own autobiography for the county
history ; whereas they say that Judge Wallace when he wrote
that opinion had in his desk the original manuscript of that
autobiography, in the handwriting of a certain :Mr. Hull, now
dead. It is true that he had that paper. lBut it is also true
that Drawbaugh agreed to pay for the publication; that he
agreed to furnish the autobiography ; that he employed Mr.-Hull
to write it out for him; that the publisher of the history neither
wrote it nor paid for one word of it, but received it in manuscript from Drawbaugh himself; and that very manuscript in
question was produced by Drawbaugh on the cross-examination of one of our witnesses, without any attempt on his part
to deny that he employed Hull to write it and that he furnished it himself to the publisher. All this is specifically testified to' and no witness denies it.
Then they charge that the circuit judge's statement as to

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

Drawbaugh's property was entirely wrong. They say the
fact is that Drawbaugh owed vast sums of money; and they
prove this by printing in a table how much he cwed in 1869,
and how much in 1870, and how much in 1871, and so on,
making apparently a large total. The fact is that with a few
unimportant changes it was the same debt that ran through
all these years, and most of it was for indorsements which he
never paid, and never was called upon to pay; so that the
total which figures in their brief at about $14,000 represents
an actual debt of about $500.
Then they attack Mr. Matthews's deposition, which Judge
Wallace thought of considerable value, by asserting that Mr.
Matthews wrote a letter (which was before the court) stating
that no reliance ought to be placed on his recollection of the
facts thus cited by the court. He made no such statement.
The letter is in the record. It confirms Mr. MKatthews's deposition explicitly. It repeats that he is sure from what Drawbaugh told him in 1878 that he is not the inventor of the
speaking telephone. It also says, as to one little matter of
detail, that he is not sure whether on that occasion Drawbaugh
merely showed him the instrument lying on a bench, or took
it up and placed it in his hands; and he does not want his
testimony in that respect relied on if that matter is of any
importance. It was not of the slightest importance, and, had
nothing to do with the very important matter for which he
was called. Judge Wallace said that that letter only showed
Mr. Matthews's scrupulous honesty, and added value to his
deposition.
The Drawbaug/ frauds.- There is no doubt that Drawbaugh at some time made all the exhibits put in evidence on
his behalf, for he produced them himself in the case in 1881.
But how long before 1881 he made them is another matter.
A large number of his witnesses are specifically proved to be
entirely mistaken about their dates. With nothing to fix
them by except mere arbitrary association, one man thinks it
was in 1875, because he sold a bushel of potatoes in that year,
and so on with others. It is absolutely proved about many of
them that the visit to Drawbaugh's shop when they first saw tel-

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

ephones were after the Bell patent instead of before., He made
all these things, and had them with many other things at his shop
before 1881. But whether the picture as given by the witness
is in long perspective or is foreshortened,- whether they look
at what they have seen through a true memory which would
find them all between 1876 and 1881, or invert the opera glass
and stretch out this history as far back as distortion can carry
it, is the whole question. There are several of these witnesses
who are specifically proved to have been debauched by Drawbaugh personally in the most infamous way; and that is
enough to end his character. The Circuit Court below so
found.
"The great argument of the other side is: Here are fifty witnesses: suppose a pistol exploded in a man's ear: it is true
that he might forget the date of the pistol explosion, and generally would, but he could not forget the explosion. Even that
argument does not touch their case. An electric telephone,
whenever they saw it, was not anything very startling to these
witnesses. To a man of science it was. But these men had
heard a string telephone in the village, and an electric telephone was no more astonishing to them. But no matter how
startling it was, that is no reason why they should associate
the true date with it. That they heard a pistol does not tell
them when they heard it. I do not think that any man in
this court room could tell me the year when he saw Donati's
comet, the most startling celestial phenomenon of our generation; nor the date of the great transit of Venus, visible here
within the last ten years. This man had his shop full of all
sorts of contrivances which the country witnesses neither understood nor cared for, and they cannot for the life of them
tell in what year they saw any of them, or give you a picture
that you can rely on, with name and date of what they did
see.
The evidence shows that Drawbaugh is a charlatan, surrounded by persons who have used him for dishonest purposes.
The story is that in his shop, before he went to the Centennial,
(for he made a visit there in the last half of October, 1876,) he
had the most perfect collection of telephones that had ever

Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

existed in the world, even up to the time this suit began in
1881, -the
perfected Bell transmitter and receiver, with all
Bell's latest improvements in all their minute details; the Edison carbon-powder telephone; the carbon microphone, which
has made Berliner, and Edison, and Hughes famous; and,
finally, the Blake transmitter, with all its marvellous delicacy
of detail, -except those parts which the eye does not see and
which never got into Drawbaugh's instruments. lie says that
in that year lie went up to the Centennial to see Mr. Bell's
telephone, which lie had read of, and spent live days there;
that lie went with his friend, Mr. Leonard, his neighbor for
ten years, the richest man in the village, and he saw Bell
exalted to the heavens for his feeble instruments, when
he himself had then all the improved and perfected forms,
wb;hi all the genius of the world spent the next five years in
inventing; and yet he never opened his mouth to anybody
at the Centennial, not even to Mr. Leonard, his neighbor who
went with him.
Mir. Leonard, his neighblor and fellowtraveller, did not know that Drawbaugh had a telephone at
that time. Then he caine back and laid a plot to sell to
Shapley, his friend and neighbor, as his own invention, the
right to patent the Bain electric clock, which he had copied
out of Tomlinson's Encyclopedia, twenty years old; and he
never told Mlr. Shapley lie had invented the telephone, or
that he wanted money to exploit it.
Late in 1S78 he formed a partnership between himself and
one Chellis, who kept a ninety-nine cent store in Harrisburg,
and Mloffitt, an erratic dentist. Ile had then a plan for another
improvement in an already improved molasses spigot; and,
according to their present theory, lie also had all these enormous inventions right there in the same room, where they had
been perfected, as every one knew, if their story is true, before
1876. What lie was really doing with the telephone at that
time was trying to improve the telephones that Mr. Bell had
invented. That part of his history-that he was then trying
to improve the telephone -got into the local newspapers, and
cannot be sworn away.
These two proposing partners looked over the contrivances

he then had, in December, 1878, when Bell's telephones were
in extensive use,- his improved telephones and his molasses
spigot, -and they said they would rather take the molasses
spigot. Why? Because, said they to him, "Bell has got a
patent on the telephone, and you cannot anticipate him." And
yet one of these men, iloffitt, had been Drawbaugh's bosom
friend for ten years, a frequenter of his shop, had known all
of his inventions, and now comes with the story that he knew
Drawbaugh's telephones and talked through them years before
Bell was ever heard of. The two partners talked with him a
good deal about this in December, 1878, and early in 1879,
and they said to him, "You cannot antedate Bell;" and Drawbaugh replied, "I don't know." They discussed the matter
again - this old friend Iffoffitt and Chellis - and they said,
" No, you cannot," and would not touch it, but took the molasses -spigot. Now, in 1882, comes Chellis as the man who
produced Drawbaugh to the world and sold him out for a
defence to these infringers, and Moffitt as one of his chief
supporting witnesses, and they say they know, and there is
not a doubt about it, that he antedated Bell by ten years.
They had an interference controversy with Iauck about
priority in the molasses spigot, and they went into that and
had a fight in 1879. They had the same counsel they have
got now, -Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Hill; and they beat Hlauck
and went into the business of making molasses spigots, at a
great expense, When, according to the story they now tell,
they had there in that room, "and had had for ten years, this
great invention, and everybody knew it. But they either did
not know it then, or did not know it enough to put a dollar
into it. Presently they thought they could make a speculation out of Drawbaugh's story. They 'now say that they
found in 1879 that instead of working on this spigot he was
spending all his time on the telephone. What was he doing?
Why, if their story be true, he had made his most perfect instruments two or three years before that, and never added to
them afterwards. If their story is true, his work was completed. But he was working on them then. The newspapers
of the day said so. I have no doubt he was working on tele-

Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

phones in 1879, and that it was then, and not in 1876, that he
was making the Blake transmitter. But Ohellis then knew
that he could not speculate on Drawbaugh's "prior invention"
of the telephone, for he had talked with Drawbaugh, and he
had talked (all this is in Ohellis's deposition) with Drawbaugh's
wife, and the result he came to was that he "could not antedate Bell," and it was not worth while putting a cent into the
telephone..
By and by he met Shank, and asked him, and Shank said,
-Why, Dan had been at work on it many years, perhaps as
far back as 1870. That was news to Chellis; he had only
been getting his information from Drawbaugh himself, and
Drawbaugh's wife. The result was that when they took testimony they put on the stand Shank as their first witness, and
then the witnesses whom Shank had hunted up, and they
swore it back; and after they got through a crowd of such
men they called Drawbaugh to the stand and asked him if
what these men had sworn to was not true; and the best that
can be said for him is that he would not deny it.
When they got Shank, and Ohellis thought there was a
chance of speculation, he sent for his counsel, Mr. Hill, and
they looked it up together. It would have cost them thirty
dollars to make two applications -fifteen dollars for the telephone, and fifteen more for the microphone. The two years
statutory limitation had run against the telephone in 1879;
but it had not run against the microphone; and if there is a
word of truth in Drawbaugh's story, there would not have
been the slightest difficulty of proving in 1879 when he had
his microphone; and there could not have been the slightest
difficulty in proving that he had had telephones before Mr.
Bell, for Mr. Bell's telephone was only three years old, and the
microphones of Berliner and Edison about two years old, and
everybody knew this. Moreover, they all knew the great fight
which was raging at that very time between the Western
Union and the Bell companies. They had no occasion to
spend any money. All they had to do was to take their story
to either the Bell company or the Western Union, and they
could have got a million dollars for it just as it stood, if -they

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Dickerson's Argument for American Bell Telephone Co.

could have got either of those companies to believe it. But
they knew too well to try that, for responsible companies do
not buy stories until they have been sifted.
So this syndicate concluded that they would not spend
thirty dollars. although the statute was running against
them; and they would not offer their story to any corporation that might examine it; but they would make a
partnership, and they would get Drawbaugh to give them
three-fourths of his story for nothing, and then they would
sell it to this People's Telephone Company, which paid
them $20,000 casl and a lot of stock, without stopping to
take the opinion of counsel or to- spend so much as a half
a day in investigating the story. All this was done. It is
proved in the record by the deposition of Chellis himself.
It was a good speculation also for this company which purchased this falsehood. It at once issued five million dollars of
stock on it, and with some of the money they got from selling
that stock they for the first time applied for patents -on July
22, 1880. They published a proclamation, and we sued them.
and they came before the Circuit Court in New York in
October, 1881, with a bagful of affidavits, and we challenged
them to produce them, and they said they would risk an injunction rather than produce them. They were wise, because
the moment they put those affidavits before the court the
affidavits and the story would have been spoiled, and no more
stock could be sold on them. So they kept them back and
sold stock on their "prospects."
That is the genesis and the history of this Drawbaugh speculation.
One of the frauds which illustrates their case is the water
rain story. It became advantageous for them to prove, in
order to fix a date, that the owner of a particular farm set up
on it in 1875, for the use of a particular tenant, a water ram
made by Drawbaugh. They got the owner, misled by a false
association with the date of a lease, and forgetting a later
lease of the farm to the same tenant, to swear that it was put
in in 1875; and then they put more than thirty witnesses on
the stand to swear to their own positive recollection of the

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Browne's Argument for Dolbear.

same thing. The whole story was a falsehood. Mr. Draper,
the owner, came back on the stand and admitted his mistake.
The bills for the pipe for the ram, and the freight bills on the
railroad, and the receipts on the railroad books, all dated in
1878, and correspondence between the owner and his farn
agent, written in December, 1877, complaining that the ram
was not in, were found by us and produced. Dawbaugh himself made the ram and put it up, and had all the-accounts and
dates of it, but would not come forward himself to swear to.
any dates about it. Finally they had to abandon the fiction
and admit that it was put in in 1878". Yet Drawbaugh, with
this knowledge, and after he and his partners had seen these
papers, procured these men to swear it back to 1875.
Then the Hunnings transmitter fraud was of the same character. They attempted to deceive Judge Wallace in open
court, and then attempted to deceive this court in the Philadelphia tests, by smuggling the Hunnings invention inside
their broken tumbler instrument F. We detected the fraud
and exposed it; and if there had ever been any moral charactdr
to the case before that, this would have destroyed it.
[In closing, -31r. Dickerson contrasted the united recognition
of the value of Mr. Bell's inventions by the scientific world of
Europe, with the attacks upon him in the defence of these
suits.]
-Mr. Causte Browne for Dolbear.
It has suited the convenience of our opponents, in the courseof their argument, to speak of the several appellants whose
cases are before the court, as having contributed each an
ingredient, so to speak, of a certain mixture to be used for
the common behoof against the health of the Bell patent.
That is a figure of speech. It is also, if they will pardon me,
a fiction. So far as I am aware, no one of the appellants in
this case has any right to speak for any other. I certainly
know that nobody has any right to say anything for the Dolbear interest, except Mr. Maynadier and myself. The court
will remember that these cases were grouped together upon

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Browne's Argument for Dolbear.

the docket, partly for the convenience of the court and partly
for the convenience of counsel, that an end might be made of
the whole matter. The counsel for the several appellants are
companions, but not allies. Every man fights his own battle
in his own way.
Now, as to the Dolbear Company, its defence to the Bell
Company's suit is different in kind from the defence of any
other appellant here. It is this: that the Dolbear method
and apparatus'do not infringe, even under the broadest construction of the ]Bell patent that the law will permit; that
they are based upon a discovery of Mr. Dolbear as original
and as fundamental as that of -Mr. Bell; that he as well as
Bell, although coming several years after him, started from
first principles to deal with the problem of electrically transmitting speech; that Bell proceeded by one road, which lay
open to him by virtue of the scientific knowledge of that date;
while Dolbear proceeded by a road discovered by himself
where scientific men had supposed a practical advance in the
arts to be impossible; and that, except in reaching the result
of electrically transmitting speech, stated in one form of words
or another, there is no resemblance between the two methods
or the apparatus employed by the two inventors, so far as
regards any patent protection enjoyed by Mr. Bell. You will
at once see that many issues which have been discussed before
you during the last two weeks are of no materiality to the
Dolbear defence. If any alleged anticipation of Mr. Bell's
invention of the speaking telephone, or if any assumed narrow
construction of his patent, shall prevail, so much the better
for us, of course. Your labors in dealing with the Dolbear
defence will, in that event, be lightened. But all of these
defences may fail; all attempts to prove anticipation of Mr.
Bell's invention may fail; all attempts made by other appellants to limit the construction of his patent may fail; and vet
the defence of the Dolbear Company remain untouched.
, No construction of this patent will cover the Dolbear method
as an infringement, except a broad construction for the use of
electricity for the purpose of -tansmitting apticulate &Peech.

That will do it. But that, in words or in substance, must be

maintained as the prerogative and monopoly of Bel, or, I
humbly venture to believe, I shall have no difficulty in satisfying you that the decree in the Dolbear case mu-i. be reversed.
I suppose it was because no other construction thau, this would
suffice to suppress the practice of the Dolbear mhotbed, that
a theory of invention so dangerously broad, to say the least,
was asserted by the counsel for the Bell Company. I shall
in due time make it plain that no such dangerous - I was
going to say wild-theory of patentable invention will be
found suggested by Mr. Bell in the specification which he,
as we have learned from the argument, drew with his own
hand.
The fifti claim of the patent, in so far as it is a claim for a
method, reads thus : "The method of . . .transmitting vocal

or other sounds telegraphically, as herein described, by causing
electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of the
air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds, substantially
as setforth." Here are two limiting expressions: "as herein
described" and "substantially as set forth." Now, I suppose
that one of these, no matter which, is intended to refer the
reader to the description of what is meant by the term, "electrical undulations"; and I suppose that the other, no matter
which, is intended to refer to the description of the way in
which those undulations are produced and used. Rejecting
certainly one of them, and as I believe both of them, the
counsel have set up as the patented invention of Bell the
transmission of speech by means of "electrical undulatons
sinilar in forr, to the 'vibrations of the air accompanying
the said vocal or other sounds," or, as they otherwise express
it, "electrical changes which correspond to the sonorous motions
of the air." Causing the sonorous motions of the air, (that is,
the vibrations produced by speech,) to bring about, no matter
how, corresponding electrical changes of any sort, -which electrical changes bring about, no matter how, sonorous motions
of the air, like the first, -is the patented invention, as the
appellees contend.
This was substantially the view taken by Mr. Justice Gray
in the court below. I respectfully submit that this, while

things, ex vi termini, whenever speech is transmitted by electricity. Of course, if a man cannot have a good patent, as it
is aoTeed he cannot, for the use of electricity to transmit
speech, he cannot have a good patent for that in which the
electrical transmission of speech consists. He has changed the
words of his claim, but not the things claimed.
[Mr. Browne here quoted from several scientific witnesses
in support of this position, and among others from Dolbear,
taking occasion to defend him from some attacks that had
been madd against him.]
The court below dismissed this testimony, saying: "The
evidence in this case clearly shows that Bell discovered that
articulate sounds 'could be transmitted by undulatory vibrations of electricity, and invented the art or process of transmitting such sounds by means of such vibrations. If that art
or process is (as the witnesses called by the defendant say it
is) the only way by which speech can be transmitted by electricity, that fact idoes not lessen the merit of his invention,
or the protection which the law will give to it."
The learned Justice misunderstood. It is not a question of
the only way to transmit speech by electricity. Producing
electrical changes upon the line corresponding to the sonorous
air changes is not a way of transmitting speech by electricity.
It is doing it. It is that in which the electrical transmission
of speech consists. It is the alternative form of words for the
same thing. Not only do we see now that the electrical transmission of speech implies that, and consists in the fact that,
the sonorous motions of the air produced by speech, shall in
some way cause corresponding electrical changes of some kind
in the line conductor, which electrical changes shall in some
way cause sonorous motions of the air like th6 first; but it was
a physical truth, kno'n among scientific men, and practically
applied, that the electrical transmission of sound in general
implied, and consisted in, the production in the line conductor
of electrical changes corresponding to whatever sonorous

utilization of those electrical changes to produce sonorous
changes in the air like the first.
Whether Reis did or (lid not successfully reduce to practice
a speaking telephone, lie certainly (lid transmit sonorous air
vibrations made by human speech ; and lie certainly knew that
if he would traiismnit speech. lie must translate into electricity
the vibrations of the air, in their relative (uratiol, and that so

far as lie failed, his mistake was in SUpl)posing that lie could do
it with his aplparatus.
The philosophy of the motion of air particles is this. 'lhe

Nothing produces any result except the
movenment of the air particles to an(t fro in straight lines.
Every movement of air particles to and fro is a vibration, relatively long or short. In speech, every air 1)article moves or
vibrates in obedience to a eombination of impulses, the chief
being that which would, by itself, produce what is called the
fundamental, and the others being such its would produce
what are called overtones; and it is the mixture of these fundamental vibrations and overtone vibrations which gives what
we call quality. But the whole is nothing and can be nothing

hides; for every vibration has some pitch, and some amplitude; that is what vibration means ; and there is nothing but
vibrations of air particles to do the business. These various
constituent vibrations do not separately exist in fact. Only
the resultant of them exists in fact, and is felt by any one air
particle; as only the resultant of several forces applied to a
billiard ball appears in the direction and character of the motion it takes up. And what is it that acts upon the ear, or
upon the diaphragm against which you talk in using the telephone? It is and can only be the condensation and rarefaction
of the adjacent air, varied according to the resultant of the
forces by which the air particles at the rear of the elastic column of air have been acted upon. I say "elastic column," for,
when I talk to your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, you may imag-

ine a column of air reaching from my mouth to the drum of
your ear. I press upon the end of that column next my.
mouth in a certain way. Your ear can perceive nothing but
rarefactions and condensations, variations in degree, and in
kind, if you please, of pressure upon the drum of your ear,
due to impulses which I have given to my end of the column,
and which have propagated themselves through to your ear.
Condensation and rarefaction mean variations of pressure produced by movements of air particles to and fro. It can mean
nothing else.
[-Mr. Browne then read from the Gartenlanbe Reis publication the passage commencing " Our ea" and ending "from
each other," which will be found on page 65, supra, and contended that the whole problem was there stated, and that if
what that writer says is necessary to be done, be done, the
transmission of speech will follow.]
Mr. Bell undertook to solve this problem which, according
to the appellees (and I have no occasion to dispute it) had
baffled the scientific world, including, if you please, Mr. Reis.
I have nothing to say against that. Mr. Bell came along and
solved that problem; and that was, shall I say, all he did?
Why, was it not a great thing to be the first man to solve that
problem? Have I detracted a particle from his just renown as
an inventor? Surely not. I am but protecting the right of
another inventor to start also from first principles and, if he
can, to find a method which is not that of Mr. Bell, in solving
the same problem.
[After referring to Tilghman v. Proctor,102 U. S. 707, as a
correct and clear statement of the distinction in law between
a patent for a process and a patent for a principle, .Xr.Browne
continued:]
We have now to inquire what was the method invented by
Mr. Bell for solving the problem presented to him.
When he took his patent, there was but one agent that had
ever been used for variably attracting any object so as to make
it vibrate and beat the air and give out audible sound. That
agent was magnetism. There was but one practical use to
which electricity had ever been put for the purpose of so cans-

Mr. Browne's Argument f6r Dolbear.

ing a body to vibrate and give out audible sounds; and that
was as a Xyowing c rrent making an iron core an electro-magnet,
the variations of current strength causing like magnetic variations. Mr. Bell found a way to get electrical changes, corresponding in form to the sound waves, in the current traversing
the coils of an. electro-magnet, and so to produce corresponding
variations in the magnet, and corresponding vibrations of a
receiver armature. When I come to look at his patent, I shall
give him the broadest construction that the actual fact of his
invention can give any one; but I cannot, as I have been
taught the law, include in his invention something which
neither he nor any other man had then done or supposed
could be done; that is to say, cause an armature to vibrate
and give audible sounds by variations of electrical attraction,
with no use of magnetism at all.
Dolbear, on the other hand, reduced to the service of mankind for the first time that property which Mr. Maynadier
spoke of as the property of amnber, or elektron, electricity,
amberism. The power of a body charged with electricity to
attract anything, though known for two thousand years to
exist, had never been put to any practical use in the arts when
Professor Dolbear made his invention; certainly it had never
been supposed that variations of electrical attraction could
cause corresponding vibrations of an armature. No instrument having any such operation ever existed before Mr. Dolbear's invention. Dolbear's receiving apparatus is properly
enough called a condenser, because in structure it generally
resembles the old condensers. That is to say, it has two plates
electrically insulated and charged. But the operation is radically different from that of the old condensers. No operation
of vibrating either plate by variations of electrical charge was
contemplated or performed in the case of any of the old condensers. The arrangement of the parts or elements of the
condenser did not admit of its being performed.
[After referring to and describing the Reis-Wright apparatus
and the Yarley patents, Xlr. Browne continued:]
It is altogether a mistake to say that in any of these instruments there was any use whatever made of the power of elec-

OCTOBER TERMT,

trical attraction, still less of varying electrical attraction, to

control by way of vibration a diaphragm or any armature
whatever set up in the electrical field. In all these old condensers the elements were placed close together, with a nonconductor (I do not mean air, but a solid non-conductor) interposed and closely fitted -between them, so that the electricity
might be condensed, -whicl non-conductor prevented any practical vibration of either of the elements.
In the Dolbear receiver, on the contrary, one of the plates is
held firmly so that it cannot vibrate, and the other is held so
as to be free to vibrate according to the variations of electrical
charge, and beat the air and give an audible sound; the two
plates being separated by a body of air, so that no current can
pass. Here was a change in construction, designed to produce
a new operation, for a new purpose, without which change
that operation could not be performed nor that purpose
answered. To hold one element of a condenser still, so that
it shall not vibrate, and suspend the other so that it shall
vibrate, and then make use of its vibration according to variations of electric charge, was wholly and absolutely new. No
such instrument existed. No such use of any instrument had
ever been proposed or supposed to be possible. It cannot be
said with any show of reason that any equivalent for it was
found in any of the old condensers.
Dolbear's discovery of the capacity of variations of electrical
attraction to make an armature vibrate accordingly, was accidental. He says that when he showed it to scientific men,
without exception they expressed their astonishment at hearing that variations of the electric potential of a terminal plate
could practically produce any sound vibrations of an opposed
diaphragm comparable to those produced by the varying
attractions of an electro-magnet."
It is,' I submit then, the truth that Mr. Dolbear, like Mr. Bell,
has made (in the language of the brief of the appellees) an
application of the laws of nature which no one had ever made
before, which no one had thought of befcre, by an instrument
which did not exist before, the result only being the same that is to say, the electrical transmission of speech; or, in

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Browne's Argument for Dolbear.

other words, making speech bring about corresponding electrical changes on the line conductor which in turn bring about
corresponding audible vibrations at the receiving station.
The appellees say that "the characteristic of Mr. Bell's
current is form, not mere continuity. The invention of the
speaking telephone does not consist in the employment of a
merely continuous as distinguishedfrom a merely intermittent
current."
But Professor Cross, their leading expert, says in his deposition:
"In an electrical speaking telephone the connection between
the transmitter and receiver must be such that the latter shall
not be acted upon merely at separate intervals, but the armature or other movingportion,of the receiver must be constantly
tinder the influence of and guided by the variations in the
electrical current caused'by the motions of the armature or
other vibrating portion of the transmitter; and this vibrating
portion of the transmitter itself must be able to substantially
take up the complex motions of the air particles which act
upon it. Only in this way can the quality, as well as the
intensity of other sounds be reproduced, since not only the
frequency of vibration but also the varying amplitude, and
especially the varying form, must be reproduced in order to reproduce the quality called 'articulation.' The electrical circuit
of the instrument must always _resent an uninterruptedpath
by which the continually varying current may travel from the
transmitter to the receiver; that is, the*circuit containingthe
battery or other source of, electricalpower, the transmitter,line
wire, receiver and earth,or return wire must always be closed."
But the appellees say that there areflowing currents in Dolbear's method. In a sense this is true; but not in the sense
of the Bell invention or of the Bell patent. The current in
which the electrical changes corresponding to the sonorous air
changes are produced, is the current on the line conductor
extending, as Mr. Cross says, from the generator through the
transmitter, through the receiver and back to the generator.
This is plain from the Bell specification, for in the form of his
apparatus shown in Fig. Tiand explaiied in the corresponding

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Browne's Argument for Dolbear.

paragraph of the specification, there is no other current than
that; the transmitter is an inductive diaphragm. In the corn-.
mercial Bell telephone there is used a local circuit at the transmitting station for the purpose of producing the proper variations in the magnet at that same station; and so there is in
the Dolbear apparatus. But this local circuit, including the
magnet, is only for the purpose of inducing upon the line conductor, running from the transmitting station through the
receiving station, the currents which are to do the work of
transmitting the speech to the receiving station. These currents are in Bell the well-known circuit currents converted into
magnetism by traversing the coils of an electro-magnet at the
receiving station. In Dolbear, they are merely the currents
which move to or from the receiving plate. which is thereby
variably charged from instant to instant, so that it may exert
its variable electrical attraction, there being no magnetism at

all. The currents in the two are thus seen to be essentially
d~izf ent in character,pwpose, and res'ult.

The currents of Bell do their described work of transmitting
the speech to the receiving station and there delivering it, by
virtue of flowing, and only while they are flowing, through
the coils of the receiving electro-magnet, whose corresponding
magnetic variations vibrate the receiving diaphragm. All that
vibrates the receiving diaphragm in Dolbear is the variations
of charge of electricity in his attracting plate.
Mr. Bell employed, under the name of electrical undulations,
variations of current strength producing like changes of magnetism, to receive and transmit air vibrations under the known
law of the electrical transmission of sound, i.e., that the electrical changes must correspond with the sonorous air changes.
Dolbear employed variations of electrical .charge to receive
and transmit air vibrations under the same well-known law.
Neither could patent the correspondence of the electrical
changes with the sonorous air changes, because that was the
known law -of electrically transmitting sounds.
There is another way of putting this case: Mr. Reis tried,
and, if you please (although that is disputed) failed, to transmit
speech by variations ofcurrent strength in an interrupted cl"-

cuit. Mr. Bell tried, and succeeded, in transmitting speech by
variations of current strength in a constantly closed circuit.
Mr. Dolbear transmits speech by variations of electrical attraction, using no circzit, and no flowing current for that purpose
at all.
I have thus far refrained from any examination of the Bell
specification on the question of the construction of his patent,
and have confined myself to a comparison of the things done
by the two men, Bell and Dolbear. If the things done are, as
I trust I have satisfied you that they are, essentially different,
no possible construction of the patent for the one can make it
cover the other. I now ask your Honors to look at the Bell
patent and see if you do not find the specification (written by
Mr. Bell's own hand) to be drawn with the clearest recognition
of the fact that his invention lay in transmitting speech electrically by producing on the line conductor running to the
receiving station electrical changes (coriesponding to the
sonorous air changes) in currents of electricity traversing
the coils.of an electro-magnet at the receiving station, and in
that way converted into magnetism of corresponding variations at that station, which magnetic variations perform the
work of vibrating the receiving armature accordingly to give
out audible sounds like those spoken at the transmitter.
The specification describes no circuit but a ring circuit, running from the positive pole around to the negative pole, and
at the receiving station traversing the coils of an electromagnet. It describes a way of getting multiple telegraphy;
it describes a way of transmitting musieal tones; and lastly
it describes a way of transmitting speech. But everywhere,
throughout the specification, there is this one constant and
sole agent employed for transmitting the air vibrations produced in either case, and reproducing them to the ear, viz., a
constant circuit with a,current converted into magnetism, whose
variations vibrate corre&.pondingly the receiving armature.
Take the paragraph where the method of and apparatus for
transmitting speech are described. Strip away as immaterial
everything which can, by the most liberal interpretation, be
so regarded. Let it cover a vibrating metallic disk as well as

the described membrane carrying an attached piece of metal.
Let it cover a variable resistance transmitter instead of a
magneto transmitter, because that substitution may be found
suggested in another part of the specification. But if anything
in the description of the method of and apparatus for transmitting speech is characteristicof and essential to Bell's invention, it is this, that the current from transmitting station to
receiving station on which the required electrical changes are
to be impressed, is a current traversing the coils of an electromagnet, and that the operative poWer for vibrating the receiving diaphragm is the varying magnetism so produced in that
electro-magnet.
No such current is employed by Dolbear for transmitting
speech. No magnetism is used by him for reconverting the
electrical changes into sonorous air changes. His method is
new, because based upon a mode of using electricity not at
the time of BelPs patent known to be practicable, and is substantially and fundamentally different from Bell's. His apparatus is new, and it is essentially different from Bell's for the
same reason.
The only resemblance between Bell and Dolbear is in the
fact that each produces, somehow, electrical changes in the
line conductor corresponding with the sonorous air changes
made by speaking, and reconverts those electrical changes,
somehow, into sonorous air changes at the receiving station.
But this cannot be validly patented by Bell (even if his specification would hear such a construction) because it is, under
another form of words, patenting the use of electricity for
transmitting speech, and this, it is agreed, cannot be done.
.Mr. Wheeler H. Pecekhar for the Molecular Telephone
Company.
It is, of course, apparent to the court at this time, that there
is a very considerable difference in the position occupied by
the several parties defendant to this litigation. My learned
friend, who represents the Dolbear interest, has stated with
considerable emphasis that he speaks alone for that interest.

TELEPHONE CASES.
ir.

Peckham's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

That interest would be entirely subserved, possibly better
subserved by such a decision as should find that the Bell
patent was valid in its broadest construction, and that their
defence alone that they did not infringe -was valid, because
there then would be left the Bell Telephone Company and
the Dolbear Telephone Company as the sole possessors of the
field. On the other hand, if the Drawbaugh defence should
prevail alone and by itself, while, for the moment, the field
is thrown open to all, very plausible applications could be
made to Congress for a grant by a special patent to that
inventor, of a privilege such as has been enjoyed by the Bell
Company. On the other hand, the Molecular Company and
all other companies which stand in similar position, depend
solely upon the ground that this Bell patent must be limited
to the sphere of a magneto telephone, and that, in so far as
its claims are broader than that, it has been anticipated by an
anticipation of general-avail to all.
[fr'. Peckham, after controverting various positions taken
by Mr. Dickerson and Mr. Storrow, and after analyzing the
inventions of IReis and others prior to Bell, with the aid of
plans and models, concluded as follows touching Bell's inventions and patents :]
All those things were before Mr. Bell came. Now, what
did Mr. Bell do? Mr. Bell, adopting the magneto method of
effecting electrical results, took the apparatu off Ieis and
adapted it to that magneto method; he'did not do anything
else. You have here substantially'the equivalent of the Reis
apparatus, with a little difference in sbape;.it is adapted to
the magneto method; this, the Reis apparatus, is adapted to
the variation of a constant current made by a battery; this,
Fig. 7 of Bell patent, on the contrary, makes its current itself;
when you speak there is a-current, and when you do not speak
there is none - or when you vibrate this diaphragm in whatever way you choose, there is a current, and when the diaphragm is still there is none.
Now, I will call your Honors' attention very briefly, I necessarily must, to things that have been done by Mr. Bell, and to
some few clauses in his patent, and also to sonie few clauses in

OCTOBER TERMI,

the specification prepared by him and sent abroad, and which
has been alluded to in other arguiments during this case for
other purposes, in order to show that by the term "method"
in the fifth claim of his patent, he, Mr. Bell, meant the magneto method and nothing else, and that the broader meaning
was given to the word by his lawyer and not by him. Mr.
Bell says that he first determined to devote himself to carry
out to a practical result his conception as to multiple telegraphy, and when he came over to America he devoted himself
constantly to the investigation of magneto electricity. He
early had the idea, and he expressed it very soon in some letters, that magneto currents, the magneto method, if once the
currents were strong enough, could be availed of for multiple
telegraphy and also for the purposes of transmission of speech.
The two things were in his mind together; but he was so
strongly weighed down, as it were, with the mental conviction
that the magneto currents would be insufficient to produce any
practically useful result, that he never tried the experiment.
His multiple telegraph instruments at first were of the same
character as Ararley's; that is, they were actuated by the making and breaking of a primary circuit which induced undulations in the secondary circuit, and in that way operated the
receiving reed. Now, that was Mr. Bell's apparatus. That
was his way that he had in mind. It was to develop this magneto system, wherein the work is done by varying the electromotive force, so that he might avail of it for purposes of multiple telegraphy, and at the same time for purposes of speech,
if it should be carried out. Now, without reference to what
went before that, I will call your Honors' attention to the first
letter Mr. Bell writes upon this subject.
He had been, up to this time, experimenting or devising, as
is the language he uses, devising multiple telegraph instruments. He had not carried them out in any concrete machine. "Devising" is his term for thinking of them. He
then writes:
"Another experiment has occurred to me, which, if successful, will pave the way for still greater results than any yet
obtained. The strings of a musical instrument in vibrating

TELEPHONE CASES.
Air. Feckham's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

undergo great changes of molecular tension;, in fact,'the
vibration represents the struggle between the tension. of the
string and the moving force impressed upon it. I have read
somewhere that the resistance offered by a wire to the passage
of an electrical current is affected by the tension of the wire.
If this is so, a continuous current of electricity passed through
a vibrating wire should meet with a varying resistance, and
hence a pulsatory action should be induced in the current. If
this turns out to be the case, the oscillations of the current
should correspond in amplitude, as well as in the rate of
movement, to the vibrations of the string. One consequence
would be that the timbre of a sound shofild be transmitted.
Theplan for transmitting timbre that I explained to you before, viz., causing permanent magnets to vibrate in front of
electro-magnets, is generally defective on account of the feebleness Qf the induced currents. If the otherplan is successful,
the strength of the current can be increased ad liblitum without
destroying the relative intensities of the vibrations."
He went on and tried that experiment and it failed. He
did not try it' with a vibrating diaphragm. He did not try it
in any way to see whether the voice could have any effect in
such work. Hie merely tried pulling the string or twisting the
string, the wire; and it failed to give any sound whatever. No
sound whatever was carried, and that experiment and that
idea were dropped just then and there.
Now, your Honors will see what it is that Mr. Bell called his
method at that early, period. He draws, in that letter, a clear
and plain distinction between the two methods, the one his
magnet method, which he has not carried out to any practical
result, because of his apprehension of the feebleness of the currents, and the other this method by varying the resistance, and
in that way producing results at the receiving end, which he
calls the other method. He speaks of them in that letter as
"plans" ; your Honors will see that when he is asked a question, immediately after giving the letter, and saying that he
had made the experiments, he says on page 1606 (Comps.
proof, Peop. Rec.), in speaking of that letter:
"When I speak in this letter of my '_plan for transmitting
timbre,' I mean my method of transmitting articulate speech."

OCTOBER TERMI,

1887.

Mvr. Peckham's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

So that, at that early period, we find Mr. Bell drawing this
strong, plain, clear distinction between these tvo methods,
these two plans, the one the magnet method, the other the
varying resistance method.
On the second of June Mr. Bell made the discovery that
these magneto currents, which he had before regarded as too
feeble to carry out successfully to any practical purpose his
plan to operate by the magneto method, were not so feeble as
he supposed. He discovered and found that they might be
used for some practical purpose,' and then he immediately
drops, and you never hear anything more of the plan or
method which he had referred to in this letter of transmitting
by varying the resistance, and the experiment which he tried,
the experiment having completely failed. From that moment
you never at any time, up to the issue of this patent, hear of
any plan or the discussion of any plan for effecting the result
by variable resistance. On the 2d of June he finds out by the
accidental discovery that has been alluded to in the course of
this argument that the magneto inst'uments are not so feeble
as he supposed, -and thereupon from that moment he goes on,
in the course of experiments devoted to the perfection and
carrying out of the magneto method, which, by that accidental discovery, he had found to be sufficient for his purposes. It is availed of principally for the purposes of multiple
telegraphy. It perfects his system of multiple telegl'a phy. It
is carried out in that.
I will now turn to the letter of Mr. Bell, or before I do that
I will turn to his answer, and I -want to read a few of these
lines :
that is, in the summer of 1874- "I pro"At that time"

by the vibration of an armature actuated by the voice of a
speaker, so that the electrical current employed would be Procuced by the action of the voice itself. and not iuel)endently
of it; hence the reproduced vibrations would necessarily be
very much feebler than the originals, and it was questionable
in my mind how far they would be of practical value. During the wiriter of 1874 and the spring of 1875 this feeling led

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Peckham's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

me to seek some method by which the voice, instead of producing the electrical current used, should merely modify a current
produced by other means. In May, 1875, I devised" - the
*ord "devised" means that he thought out-" a method of
varying the resistance of a galvanic circuit by the action of
the voice in the hope that this would obviate the supposed insufficiency of the magneto-electric currents to produce practically operative effects. I was still carrying on experiments
and researches regarding this method when the accidental discovery made on the 2d of June, 1875, already testified to,
proved that the insufficiency of the magneto-electric current
to produce audible effects was a mistake."
And then he goes on with his invention with regard to the
magneto-electric currents.
On July 1, 1875, he writes Mr. Hubbard:
"The experiment to which I alluded when I saw you last
promises to be a grand success. On singing this afternoon in
front of a stretched membrane attached to the armature of an
electro-magnet, the varying pitch of the voice was plainly perceptible at the other end of the line, no battery nor permanent
magnet being employed."
"When the vibrations are received upon another stretched
membrane in place of a steel spring, it is possible, nay, it is
probable, that the ' timbre' of the sound will be perceived. I
hope to try the experiment to-morrow afternoon."
That was written about a month after he had made this
discovery, and it is the first time'that there, is anything in
print or any letter written by him to indicate that he intended
to make another stretched membrane, or two stretched membranes. The first he had made immediately after the discovery of June 2d was with but a single membrane, an instrument substantially like that. .It had not any cone here and it
was received on a.reed, a vibrating reed, a steel reed alone.
After that we find Mr. Bell writing the letter of August
14th, on page 263 of our brief. What does he do here? It is
the same thing. Mr. Storrow commented upon this letter as.

form; there had been no directions given by which anybody

could follow it out, but he said the great idea that was at the
bottom of all telephony, that lay at the-basis of this science,
was given in this letter. I submit. to your Honors, that this
letter gave simply the idea of telephonic or telegraphic action,
telegraphic work, by means of the magneto current.
"On glancing back over the line of electrical experiments,
I recognize that the discovery of the magneto electric current
generated by the yibration of the armature of an electromagnet in front of one of the poles, is the most imp~ortant point
yet reached. I believe that it is the key to still greater things.
The effects produced, though, slight in themselves, appear to
me so great, in proportion to their cause, that I feel sure that
the future will discover means of utilizing currents obtained in
this way on actual telegraph lines. So important does it seem
to me to protect the idea that I think some steps should be
taken immediately towards obtaining a caveat or patent, for
the use of a magneto-electric current, whether obtained in the
way stated above (by the vibration of permanent magnets in
front of electro-magnets), or in any other way. I should
wish to protect it specially as a means of transmitting, simultaneously, musical notes differing in intensity as well as in
pitch. I can see clearly that the magneto-electric current will
not only permit of an actual copying of spoker utterances,
but of the simultaneous transmission of any number of \musical
notes, (hence messages) without confusion. The more I think
of it the more I see that the method of making and breaking
contact so many times per second is only the first stage in
the development of the idea. When we can create a pulsatory action of a current, which is the exact equivalent of the
aerial impulses, we shall certainly obtain exactly similar.results." The making and breaking method, above referred to,
he testifies, is that of his multiple telegraph system.
And your Honors will remember that he had spoken in the
letters before, spoken in his testimony there, of the benefit,
the desirable point, the essential element of this magneto current as being a current which was the creature of the voice,
created by it.

ing after that; he did nothing after this letter or after these
experiments of June 2d, prior to the taking out of his patent,
in the way of experiments, other than two or three experiments made in the early part of July, and which resulted in
merely obtaining a sort of muttering effect; but I want you
to look now, and it is all that I shall have time to call your
IHonors' attention to: first, to the draft specifications and
claims of Mr. Bell, and, second, to his George Brown specification or copy application. The dr'aft specifications are shown
in our brief on pages 267 to 269. These are drafts made by
him for his specification, and they show what was in the
man's mind at the time, the idea that he had, or what he
thought was really the invention which had come to him.
In the first one he speaks of his invention consisting in the
employment of a vibratory or undulatory current and "of a
method of and apparatus for producing electrical undulations."
It isthe method for producing. On the other side, there is a
short paragraph in which he speaks about "inducing undulation in a continuous voltaic circuit by the motion of bodies
capabe of effecting a current." And on the next page a draft
of a claim apparently is "the method of inducing (impressing)
undulations in a continuous voltaic current." That is the
-method that was in his mind.
And then he has a third claim, which he puts in this place,
and it would be a claim for a speaking telephone; but your
Honors will see what kind of a claim it is that is here. This
-claim is:"The phonautograph, whereby two or more vocal or other
sounds, differing in pitch, loudness, and timbre, can be transmitted singly or simultaneously."
That did not come into his patent. That was left out. hHe
says nothing of that character at all in the patent.
On the other side is:
"The method of and apparatus for transmitting simultaneously sounds differing in timbre as well as in pitch and loudness. The method of and apparatus for transmitting v6cal
utterances."
And the next claim is:

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Peckham's Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

"In illustration of the method of creating a vibratory current of electricity. I shall show and describe one form of
apparatus designed to produce undulations in a continuous
voltaic current. But I wish to state here that the same effect
may be produced in many other ways, all that is necessary
being to influence the current by the vibration or motion of
bodies capable of affecting the current."
Now those are rough drafts or notes of drafts that he made
in preparing it, drawing his specification of this patent furnished by Bell and presented by him when he was being examined as a witness in the case. I am going to refer now
to the Brown paper.- I am not referring to this paper
as a branch of the argument made by Mr. Hill or for
any such purpose as Mr. Hill used it. I am referring to it.
simply as showing the point that was in the mind of this man
up to the time this specification was drafted, up to the time
when this was delivered to Mr. Brown and carried away by
him, and as helping us in the construction of the 5th claim of
the patent itself as it now stands. He says:
."Undulatory currents of ele6tricity may .be produced in
other ways than that described above, but all the met hods
depend for effect upon the vibration or motion of bodies
capable of inductive action."
Now that is the statement in the George Brown paper.
What is his claim? Claim 4- "the method of and apparatus
for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically, by"
in brackets - " inducing in a continuous voltaic circuit"that is the end of the brackets - "causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying
said vocal or other sounds, the whole for operation substantially as herein shown and described."
Now, your Honors, the question is, What is the construction
of that claim numbered here four, numbered five in the patent,
as actually issued. Your Honors will see here that he had
stated at this time, in the body of the specification, that all
these methods for producing undulations depended upon the
vibration or motion of bodies capable of inductive action; and
then he says in his claim based upon that statement in his

TELEPHONE 'CASES.
Mr. Peckham's 'Argument for Molecular Telephone Co.

specification, that he claims "the method of and apparatus
for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically by
causing electrical undulations," as therein described.
Now, how is it, by causing electrical undulations? 'Why,
causing them in the only way and the only manner in which
he had stated in the specification they could -be caused or
could be produced. That is the claim as he fixes it. there.
Now, if we turn to the patent itself, we find that the fifth
claim is substantially identical with the fourth claim in that
George Brown specification. "It is the method of and apparatus for transmitting vov -- or other sounds telegraphically,"
as therein described, "by' causing electrical undulations similar in form."
This patent contains in the specification-what was-not contained in the George Brown copy. It contains a statement
that
":Electrical undulations may also be caused by alternately
increasing and diminishing the resistance of the circuit or
by increasing and diminishing the power of the battery," &c.
But is it supposed, your Honors, that the patentee thought
when he put those words or that feature into the speoification,
that he in any way affected or intended to affect the fifth
claim, which was the fourth claim in the George Brown specification? By no means; because, when he puts this new
matter of specification in this patent, he puts in another
claim, to correspond to the new matter which he had put into
the specification of the patent. This other claim which he
has put in is the fourth claim of the-patent of the method of
producing undulations in a continuous volatile current b.Y
gradually increasing and -diminishing the resistance of the
circuit."
That is not put in as a claim having any connection with
the production of sound, or having any connection with undulations which are produced by sound waves. It is put in as a
simple claim, in and by itself, for the production of those
undulations. It is not a claim upon which this suit is founded,
and it is not a claim which has any validity, because that
thing had been done in the year 1873 with precision by IMr.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Crosby's Argument for Overland Co.

Edison, in a patent which I have already alluded to, where he
put his electrodes in water or glycerine or other liquid. So
that we have here the specifications as prepared and taken by
George Brown, speaking of a production of or causing electrical undulations, which, by the terms of the specification is
necessarily confined to the magneto method, because-the specification says that there is no other method; and then when
we have by some means, whatever they may be, whether fair
or unfair, fraudulent or honest, new thoughts from Gray or
from himself, or whatever may be the reason, the idea suggested to him and put into his patent that electrical ujndulations can be caused by the variations of the resistance of the
circuit, we find a claim put in to correspond to that; but we
do not find any change or any variation whatever of the fifth
claim.
Your Honors will see that there is not in that patent to be
found anywhere -from the beginning to the end any suggestion that there is any other method, or any other way of
causing electrical undulations by sound waves than the one
which is pQinted out and illustrated by Fig. 7. All these
prior methods of producing electrical undulations have reference to and are involved in the production of multiple telegraphy, or the production of telegraphy in some way, whether
multiple or single. . Some of them are ways that it is absolutely impossible to use in connection with the production of
sound waves;. as, for instance, the vibration of a wheel with
magnets on the periphery before the poles of a magnet; that
cannot possibly be used as a means of producing the undulations of the sound waves.
Mr. CharZes P. Crosby for the Overland Company.
An. action was brought by thg Bell Telephone Company, in
the month of November, 1884, against the Overland Telephone Company, a company incorporated under the laws of
the State of New York; and very soon thereafter, or about
that time, an action was brought in the Circuit Court of the
United States, for the District of New Jersey, and one also in

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Crosby's Argument for Overland Co.

the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; the three actions being
brought for the purpose of obtaining permanent injunctions,
and a motion being made in each of the three actions for a
preliminary injunction. By stipulation, the motion for ifijunction was argued in the three actions before the Circuit Court
of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,
at Philadelphia, before a tribunal composed of Justices Butler,
Nixon, and the presiding 'justice of the Pennsylvania Circuit.
In the bill of complaint in that action, which was one of the
papers upon which the motion for injunction was based, there
were set forth some seventeen or eighteen instances where, as
the Company claimed, there had been a prior adjudication in
their favor at Circuit. Two days of the argument there was
devoted to an endeavor upon the part of the Overland Company to show that there had been no real adjudications; and,
the history of those litigations, so far as we were able to
give them in the limited time which was allowed to us to
resist that motion, was shown upon that argument. At about
that time, for the first time, what is called the Drawbaugh
defence was called to the attention of the counsel of the
Overland Telephone Company; and by the politeness and
courtesy of counsel for the Drawbaugh, that defence so far as
ii; existed at that time, and so far as the testimony had been
taken in it up to 1884 (and which was necessarily but a partial defence at that time) was -submitted to that tribunal.
The element sought to be introduced here, and which is the
basis, as I understand it, of the molecular defence, to wit, the
Reis invention, was also partially before that tribunal, a portion of the Reis testimony having been taken. On the argument, Mr. Justice McKennon, without passing as I understand
it, upon any of the defences'--it appearing before him that
the Drawbaugh case (what was called the Drawbaugh case)
was in a position to be heard before Mr. Justice Wallace in
the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern Disirict of New York -decided to refuse, at that point, the complainant's motion for a preliminary injunction, and to retaih it
until the decision of the Drawbaugh case in New York; holding as I believe, the Drawbaugh defence at that time to be a

. 518

very serious and important defence t6 those who were engaged
in contest with the Bell Telephone Company. At the close
of that argument, Mr. Storrow, one of the counsel for the Bell
Telephone Company, made an application to that tribunal for
a restraining order pending the argument: of the -ase before
Mr. Tustice Wallace which was refused; the judge holding
that they might be entitled possibly thereafter to a final
decree, but that they were not entitled to a restraining order
in the meantime. I think that the queftion of former adjudications, which were made so salient and so prominent in that
case up to that time, were successf lly disposed of upon that
argument. The Drawbaugh case was decided by Mr. Justice
Wallace; and the Overland. recocd which contained the record
in the Drawbaugh case, and in the Spencer, the Dowd, and
the Molecular, and all of the other defences, which, so far as
counsel for the Overland Company were acquainted, were in
existence up to the 15th of October, 1885, were incorporated
in the Overland record; and when the Overland case came
on for hearing, after the decision in the Drawbaugh case, it
was not considered necessary upon the record then existing,
and in the tribunal which had just decided the Drawbaugh
case, to make any further argument; and so a decree _pro
fo2va substantially was entered, and the case came into this
court.
I only call the attentioil of the court to that for a moment,
so that it may understand (for I do not propose to go into the
detail of any of the arguments that are made here) the position of the Overland Telephone Company in this tribunal.
And with a single reference to the brief which was made in
the Drawbaugh case I shall close what I have to say .vithreference to this case, all of the defences which are peculiar to the
Overland, and out of which I suppose they may take any advantage, having been very ably presented by the various gentlemen who represent the various defendants here. Very
much of the argument of Mr. Storrow and of Mr. Dickerson
has been to the proposifion that Daniel Drawbaugh, if he at
any time prior to 1878 or 1879, had any invention of any sort
or kind which had any value, that he would have communi-

cated it to the outside world. I pass by the discussion as to
Drawbaugh's poverty, I pass by .the piteous story of his life
which is detailed upon the record; I pass by the insinuations,
the sneers, the gasconade, the buffoonery with which this man
has been treated in this tribunal, as not germane to this discussion. They are not here, I will not notice them. One great
central fact exists. At the least, Drawbaugh had some mechanical genius, at the least he had some inventive genius. It
appears from their own record that he did invent something;
that he knew something of electricity; and it appears incontrovertibly that some time prior to 1876 or 1877 by the testimony of over two hundred witnesses, that he had made, or
was trying to make an instrument that would talk and that
would talk out loud. The ingenuity of two of the subtlest
brains of modern times, I believe, has not satisfied this tribunal of the falsity of that proposition. Every appliance known
to great wealth, the-use of detectives, the employment of the
ablest counsel in America upon this question, have been
brought substantially to dispose of Drawbaugh in this manner, and I submit to this tribunal that it has failed. The
great central fact exists, and stands here like a column of
light, that Daniel Drawbaugh was trying in the years 1875
and 1876 to make a machine that talked. The cardinal, the
perhaps incomplete idea which has been worked out, existed
in the mind of this poor mechanic at :Milltown.
One word as to this portion of Mr. Dickinson's brief. It
appears by the record in this case, and to that portion of the
record which he cites, and which I beg to submit to the court,
he in every instance cites correctly -this statement, which I
beg leave to call to the attention of the court:
"Aside from the fact already shown, that he was at work
on the magneto .and carbon instruments at different times,
there is a very simple answer which appears incidentally and
naturally throughout the record. No effort was made to
-bring it out, and it appears in the testimony of witnesses, as
in that of Drawbaugh, without consciousness on their part or
his, that it was of any special importance. It is this: That
the instrument in his view was not loud enough for practical

-520

purposes unless it would talk, without holding it to the ear,
and convey the sound as far as ordinary speech. He wanted
it to talk out as a man talks."
This testimony by Free is referred to in this connection:
"He told me that he wanted to accomplish, and could do
it, to make a machine that you could stay in one corner of
the room, and putting the machine in the other corner, and
hear as distinctly as putting it to the ear" - and that Drawbaugh told him that he had not done it yet, but "I am working at it and I am going to get it accomplished."
.Now, in 1876, at the time of the Centennial, when it is
claimed that Mr. Alexander Graham Bell laid the superstructure of his great reputation -at that time, this man supposed
that a telephone had no commercial value unless it talked out
loud. At that very time that he has detailed he was doing
this, the _N7ew York Yrniune thought that the only use of the
telephone would be for "diplomats and lovers"; and the cientiftc American summed up the public opinion of it as "1a
beautiful scientific toy"; and Gardner G. Hubbard, the partner and father-in-law of Mr. Bell -a telegraph manager and
Mr. Bell's financial backer, "did not then believe the transmission of speech could be made commercially valuable." At
the time that they had that estimation of it, Drawbaugh's
idea of it was that it was of no value unless it talked out loud.
And that was the solution of that branch of this question,
which in my judgment these gentlemen have very quietly,
carefully and scientifically avoided.
We rely, for the Overland Telegraph Company, upon all
the defences that appear upon this record. We appreciate
most heartily and thoroughly the presentation of what is
called the Reis defence by my brethren Mr. Lowrey and Mr.
Peckham; but we think the Drawbaugh defence is a very
serious one here; and so far as the Overland Company is concerned, we rely upon the whole record.

is's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

Before I enter upon the argument of the disputed propositions in this case, I beg leave to say a word or two in explanation of a matter which I have feared, perhaps unnecessarily
feared, might not be thoroughly understood by the court;
and that is as to what is really shown of the history of the
case by a glance at a patent that is issued upon any day; as,
for example, the patent to Alexander Graham Bell issued on
March 7th, 1876. Several questions have been asked by the
court with reference to that; and I fear that matter may not
be perfectly clear.
When an application, is filed in the Patent Office, the practice is to allow that application to be amended, formally or
informally, sometimes in pencil marks, marked by the applicant, or by his attorney, upon the specification remaining in
the Patent Office. When that is received, the examiner
places it on file, goes to the specification, and marks around
the passage that is amended red lines, striking it out and
noting on it that the amendment marked A, B or C, or
whatever it is, is substituted for that passage, and giving
the date also. But when the patent finally issues, that document, with its amendments, is sent to the government printer,
and the government printer prints it as finally corrected.
The print that he makes is a clean, clear copy of the thing
as finally amended; and that printed patent which comes
from the government printing office does not show that any
change whatever has been made in the document. The original is sent from the government printing office back to the
Patent Office, and remains on file there, and is a part of what
is called the "File wrapper and contents."
THE

CHIEF

JUSTICE

In that connection I want to ask a

question. A paper was laid on my table this morning, called
"Certified Copy of Exhibit," which appears to be a certified
copy of a patent.
Xr. Storrow: Your iHonor has had that paper for ten days.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE: That paper, as I understand it, is a certified copy of the file wrapper in Bell's case, showing the corrections.
.r. iStorrow: No, sir; that is the certified copy brought

OCTOBER TERMf,

Mr. Hill's Arginment for People's -and Overland Cos.

by Mr. Stetson, the, clerk, from Boston, of exhibits which he
produced. It shows the blue lines and pencil marks. I have
already told that story.
Mr. Hill: When any party applies to the Commissioner of
Patents, and asks for a certified copy of that file wrapper and
contents, he gets a certified copy, among other things, of the
document which was originally filed, with all the marks which
were on it, whatever they may be, and however they may
have been placed upon it. The rule in the office of the Commissioner is to very carefully place those marks on that certified copy exactly as they are on the original. Hence, in this
case you can gather nothing from the patent-from the
printed patent of March 7th, 1876 - as to the prior history of
the application in the Patent Office. You will read in that
patent only the final result of the whole. But, if you take the
certified copy of April 10th, 1879, as printed in the Dowd
record - which is a true copy, or is assumed to be, of the record as it then appeared, then if you look at that copy, that
being a certified copy, you get not only the original document
which was filed in the Patent Office, but you find noted on
that copy the various changes which were made in it while it
was there and before the patent issued.
The pencil memoranda and obliterations of words -the
memoranda appearing in the 1879 copy, showing that words
were originally in the document, as far as we can gather from
the 1879 printed copy in the .Dowd case -that words were
originally in the document, which do not appear in the patent,
show the state of the recoid, and. show how those words appear on the document; but they do not appear there now.
The patent, as it issued March 7th, 1876, does not show that;
because the patent shows only the final form, the corrected
form; it does not show. how the corrections were made.
THE CHIEF JusrIcE: I understand you to say that the pencil
memoranda upon the Boston paper are the corrections as
finally made, and that, therefore, they should have made part
of the specifications as put in th6 patent.
IMXr. Hill: When I get along a little further
in my argument I *shall endeavor to show yoa that the paper brought

here from Boston is a paper which has been doctored to explain this thing.
[fTfr. Hill then reviewed the answers that had been made to
his argument upon the paper known as the George Brown
specification, contending that the facts which he regarded as
very damaging had not been explained; and that it was impossible that Mr. Brown, a capitalist proceeding to Europe to
invest his money in the invention, entering into a contract
with Mr. Bell to give him so many dollars per month to further develop his invention, taking a half interest in the invention abroad, should be willing to go to Europe to patent the
invention there, knowing, as he must have known when he
left New York, that there was another current which would
do the work equally well, if Mr. Storrow's theory was correct,
and if that other current was in the American specification.
He maintained that Brown desired to use the invention to prevent the lagging of cable signals; that the magneto currents
caused by the induction of an armature, which were the only
currents Bell had ill his mind, were so light and feeble that it
was impossible to use them for that purpose; that so far as
Bell in May, 1875, had an idea of varying the resistance, it
was limited to one form of apparatus - to vibrate a stretched
rod or wire, varying the current, and that this was a failure
and was abandoned; and that there was no explanation of the
fact that Bell]
"Went home from his visit to Washington on February 25
or 26 to March 3, 1876, and imnediately proceeded to construct a liquid transmitter like Gray's, got speech through
it on March 10 and then kept still about it and concealed
the fact-no explanation that the next step that he took
was to construct two magneto devices just like Gray's receiver on or about the 1st of April, and then got speech
through them; and that in his London lecture a year afterwards he tried to connect the experiment of 1875 directly
with those two experiments of April, 1876, without giving
the dates, but jumping over and keeping still about the intervening solution of the question of the transmission of speech
on March 10.'

OCTOBER TERM, 1687.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

Mr. Dickerson says that Bell's and Gray's instruments operate on exactly opposite principles. He says that Gray had
the idea of varying the resistance of the liquid by varying the
amount of liquid between the poles by bringing the poles
nearer together. But he says that it was not Bell's idea to
vary the resistance of the liquid. Let me read what Mr.
Dickerson says. I find it in my copy of the arguments, on
page 1114:
"Now you see the points of these two things. They are
both supposed to be, they both are properly called, liquid
transmitters. They work on directly opposite principlks. One
works upon the principle of approximating the two opposite
poles and having a film of liquid between them, whose thickness is varied by the vibration; and the other operates upon
the principle of dipping one of those poles in the water and
thereby delivering more electricity or less." Dipping it in
water, or in the liquid, thereby delivering more or less electricity.
Now what does the patent say ?. I appeal from Mr. Dickerson, Mr. Bell's counsel, arguing the case here and presenting a
plausible theory to lead the court to his view of the case, to
Mr. Bell, and I appeal to his decision of this question in the
patent itself. Mr. Bell says: "The reciprocal vibration of the
elements of a battery, therefore, occasions an undulatory action
in the voltaic current. The external resistance may also be
varied. For instance, let mercuiy or some other liquid form
part of a voltaic circuit, then the more deeply the conducting
wire is immersed in the mercury or other liquid, the less resistance does the liquid offer to the passage of the current."
That is what Mr. lBell says, and he says: "Hence the vibration
of the conducting wire" produces this effect. This description
of Mr. Bell is exactly the description of Gray's -caveat transmitter.
Then I come to another subject. There is another important
matter which my friends have attempted to explain. I refer
to the attempted explanation of how that certified copy of
April 10, 1879, came to be printed and appear in the record as
it does appear. Before I enter upon this explanation I wish to

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

say. that when my associate, Mr. Dixon, in his very -careful,
thorough, and able .investigation of the facts in this case had
developed the fact that there was an apparent and evident
fraud indicated by the documents on file in the suit, we had
no other evidence except those arguments to refer to, and they
seemed to be absolutely conclusive of the whole subject as to
the fraud, what it was, when it was perpetrated, and how it
was perpetrated; absolutely conclusive of the fact that since
the 10th of April, 1879, the Pateiit Office paper had beed abstracted and another document filed in the file wrapper of the
Bell application, appearing there now as the specification that
was filed by Bell. It was immediately apparent that if that
fraud had been committed in the Patent Office there w'as an
absolute necessity imposed upon the party who committed it to
commit the same fraud in the Circuit Court in Boston, because
there was a certified copy of that document as it existed on Airil
10, 1879, known to be filed in that court in Boston. If they
abstracted one of those copies and substituted a false copy in
its place, it would be necessary to do the same thing with the
other, or the other would give away the whole proceeding. It
was liable at any time to expose the whole thing. Then came
the question, But how could they do it? How could they
make that alteration or that change in the record in Boston?
Of course, it was easy enough to do it as a physical matter.
The case was an old case that had been settled and disposed
of. The obliging clerk would allow anybody who came in
there and wanted to look at those papers to take the file wrapper, sit down at the table, open them and examine them, as is
always allowed in those matters. He would not be particularly careful about it because it was an old case, an old file,
years old, everything past and done.
[21fr. ril then argued at length that these interlineations
had been fraudulently made, and continued:]
Now, may it please your Honors, with but a very short time
to spare, I must review a few points in connection with the
Drawbaugh defence. My learned brothers have argued on
the other side that in law oral evidence has never been allowed
to overthrow a patent. It is hardly necessary for me to treat

1526

that question.

If it were I would refer to Gayler 'v. Wilder,

10 How. 477; and Coffn v. Ogden, 18 Wall. 120.
It is said that the instrument marked I in the Drawbaugh
exhibits had no magnet on it when found; that is true, that
when the original model was put in evidence the magnet was
not with it; but after it had been produced before the examiner, and put in evidence, Mr. Drawbaugh found among his
various magnets at the shop a magnet which he recognized as
the original used in that. He brought that magnet over and
placed it on the instrument and it fitted its place exactly, both
in its height, in the size of the poles which fitted the holes
made for it, and in every respect it showed for itself at once
- that it was the magnet originally in the instrument.
It is said that the tumbler F could not be adjusted unless
the bottom was out of it originally. They point to the fact
that the bottom of the old tumbler is broken off, and that we
have attempted to say it was closed up; and they state to the
court that that is nonsense, because the instrument could not
be adjusted in that case; and yet, your Honors, that is the
exact fact, that the tumbler instrument F can be adjusted.
The bottom was in there; they are adjusted by the screw rod
at the top and not from the bottom. I mention that matter
to show you what trifling things are brought before the court
as evidence of importance, when they really have no importance.at all, and they are answered by the condition of the instruments right in your presence.
It is said that a string telephone existed in Drawbaugh's
shop in those early days : but there is not a word of evidence
of the kind.
In regard to the tests made in New York and Philadelphia
I want to be more particular in calling the attention of the
court to the extraordinary misrepresentations that have been
made regarding those tests. 1the history of the New York
and Philadelphia tests is substantially this: When these
Drawbaugh instruments were first put in evidence, the originals (the early ones) were dilapidated, - in some cases one or
two of the parts gone, -and I directed Mr. Drawbaugh to
make a set of instruinents that would show exactly what the

TELEPHONE CASES.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

parts were, how they were related to- the other, the other
parts, if they were all there, and put them in as reproductions.
The original instruments were offered in evidence just as they
stood, and then I directed him to make -reproductions to show
the parts that were gone. For instance, in the tin can instrument the tin can remained there. The electro-magnet remained there, but the original diaphragm had been a membrane. The mice had eaten it off or something, and it had
gone. I directed him to make another instrument, having the
tin can and 'the electro-magnet just the same, and to put a
diaphragm on it, and. if there was anything on the diaphragm
that would show, whatever it was. So he made one, which
appears as the reproduced instrument. In the same way the
tumbler instrument was reproduced and put in evidence; not
for the purpose of testing; we never had any idea of testing
those instruments, but merely to show the court what the
relations of those parts were, so far as any of them were absent, what they were in the original machines. About the
time Mr. Drawbaugh was testifying, the latter part of the taking of the testimony in the case, Mr. Benjamin, the expert,
had the curiosity to try some of those instruments and see if
they would operate: and he tested them and found that they
would operate more or less as talking telephones -those instruments that are put in in that way merely show what the
relations of the parts were. A test of those instruments was
called for by my friends on the other side, and we made the
test in iNew York at the end of Mr. Benjamin's- testimony, or
near the end of it. We had no time to make other instruments, to make other reproductions; in order to have the
parts new and properly arranged and constructed, in operative
condition, we had to take the old instruments that we had, the

been in evidence for two or three years; which had been to
Harrisburg, to Baltimore, to Philadelphia, to New York, to
Washington, back and forth dozens of times; which had been
taken aparf and examined by counsel and by experts and by
draftsmen, and had got in a very dilapidated condition; that,
is, the parts had got loose and out of position, many of them.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Mr. Hill's Argument for People's and Overland Cos.

In the instrument A; if your Honors remember it - a little flat
box with a hole near the centfe - that instrument had been so
-badly handled and abused that tie diaphragm inside of it had
become broken in two, showing to what roughness of handling
those instruments had been subjected. We had to take those
instruments and adjust them the best we could and make the
tests in New York, in order to accommodate these gentlemen,
as we had no time to prepare new instruments; and they
would have objected to them probably if we had, as not being
in evidence. The tests were made in New York, and all the
original instruments of Drawbaugh, the instrument H, the instrument A, the two instruments B and D, and the magneto
instrument J, that handsome black walnut instrument about so
square [indicating] - all those instruments operated perfectly
well. They were the original instruments of Drawbaugh.
The only instruments that did not operate perfectly satisfactoTily were the reproduced instruments that we had made, not
for testing, but simply to exhibit the arrangement of the parts
They did not operate perfectly satisfactorily; but they did
operate as speaking telephones, and did transmit sentences, and
were by no means conceded or claimed as failures, even those
that were most dilapidated.
STHE CHIEF JusTicE : That was the tumbler?
-Mr. Hill: Yes, your Honor; the tumbler operated. I will
show you the testimony in a moment, Defendants' Vol. 2,
Mr. Benjamin's testimony on pages 1278 and 1279. We will
settle that matter at once. Mr. Benjamin testifies:
"Here are some sentences, which I read from the notes,
which I heard distinctly through F and A."
F is the tumbler; A is the. round box.
TEE CHIEF JUSTI E: Is that the New York test?
.Y. Hill: That is the New York test. Mx. Benjamin testifying about the New York test and about the tumbler instruments which were used there, he says:
"Here are some sentences, which I read from the notes
which I heard distinctly through F and A, and caused to be
repeated back through the 'tell-tale' line to the room from
which they were transmitted, and where the notes were taken
by Mr. Mfarx."

The first sentence was: " What shall I do now? Shall I

"Now, listen, while I talk. Do you hear that?" That was
transmitted through the tumbler instrument at New York.
Another: "How plainly can you hear me? " That was correctly transmitted. Again: "Is now almost at its height."
That was transmitted perfectly well. Again: "For his action
in the Lamson case." Those words were transmitted perfectly.
Then he says:
"11 ave .taken these sentences at random from the notes
made in the back room, and I introduced them here merely to
show the extent of the sentences that I clearly heard through
F and A."
Then here is another. He put a Tisdel receiver on in place
of A. He says:
"When F was used as a transmitter with a Tisdel magneto
instrument as a receiver, sentences and words were received a
little, though not much better. Here are some of the sentences heard and repeated by me, and taken down by the
stenographer in the front room."
Here is one of them now, with the tumbler instrument, in
New York:
"Have you heard of Judge Wallace's appointment? How
do you like itf"
Again, "Shall I read an article to you now?"
Again, "How far can you understand what I say?"
Then Mr. Benjamin says:
"I was, and am still, of the opinion that the Tisdel hand instrument used was somewhat out of adjustment, owing to
rough handling."
Then he says:
"I took the Tisdel instrument off the line, after using it for
quite a short time with F as a transmitter, and substituted a
Bell instrument, through which I received in the front room
the following sentences, spoken into F in the back room."
The instrument F is the tumbler. He says:

are the performances of that F instrument at New York,
where my brothers have told you in their argument that the
thing was an utter total failure and that nothing could be
done at all. Those are the representations that have been
made to you about those tests; and yet that -ery instrument
was doing those things there. It was not doing as well as it
ought to have done; it was difficult to keep the adjustment.
Mr. Benjamin says it was a perpetual struggle for adljustment.
So that-when the Overland case came we made further tests.:
We have been criticised for not making further tests in the
New York case. Why, we made the tests at the very last
end of our testimony. Our testimony was all in,Mr. Benjamin was the last witness we had. Then the other side put
in their rebuttal and we could answer that but we had no
right to any further evidence in the main case. In the Overland case, however, where the evidence was not completed,
we subsequently made other tests. We had there made for
the purpose of those tests correct copies of the instruments
used in New York. We employed Professor Barker.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE: I want to ask you in that connection

Mr. CHIEF JuS-rIcE

WUATE

delivered the opinion of the court.

The important question which meets us at the outset in
each of these cases is as to the scope of the fifth claim of the
patent of March 7, 1876, which is as follows:
"The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or
other sounds telegraphically, as herein described, by causing
electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the
air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds, substantially.
as set forth."
It is contended that this embraces the art of transferring to
or impressing upon a current of electricity the vibrations of
air produced by the human voice in articulate speech, in a way
that the speech will be carried to and received by a listener at.
a distance on the line of the current. Articulate speech is not
mentioned by name in the patent. The invention, as described,
"consists in the employment of a vibratory or undulatory
current of electricity, in contradistinction to a merely intermittent or pulsatory current, and of a method of, and apparatus for, .producing electrical undulations upon the line wire."
A "pulsatory current " is described as one "caused by sudden
or instantaneous changes of intensity," and an "electrical undulation" as the result of "gradual changes of intensity exactly analogous to the changes in the density of air occasioned
by simple pendulous vibrations."
Among the uses to which this art may be put is said to be
the "-telegraphic transmission of noises or sounds of any kind,"
and it is also said that the undulatory current, when created in

OCTOBER TERM,

Opinion of the Court.

the way pointed out, will produce through the receiver at the
receiving end of the line "a similar sound to that uttered into
the transmitter at the transmitting end. One of the means
of imparting the necessary vibrations through the trahsmitter,
to produce the undulations, may be the human voice. Articulate speech is certainly included in this description, for it is an
"uttered" "sound" produced by the "human voice."
It is contended, however, that "'vocal sounds" and "articulate speech" are not convertible terms, either in acoustics or
in telegraphy. It is unnecessary to determine whether this
is so or not. Articulate speech necessarily implies a sound
produced by the human voice, and, as the patent on its face
is for the art of changing the intensity of a continuous current
of el&etricity by the undulations of the air caused by sonorous
vibrations, and speech can only be communicated by such
vibrations, the transmission of speech in this way must be included in the art. The question is not whether "vocal sounds"
and "articulate speech" are used synonymously as scientific
terms, but whether the sound of articulate speech is one of the
"vocal or other sounds" referred to in this claim of the patent.
We have no hesitation in saying that it is, and that if the
patent can be sustained to the full extent of what is now contended for, it gives to Bell, and those wrho claim under hint,
the exclusive use of his art for that purpose, until the expiration of the statutory term of his patented rights.
In this art- or, what is the same thing under the patent
law, this process, this way of transmitting speech - electricity,
one of the forces of nature, is employed; but electricity, left
to itself, will not do what is wanted. The art consists in so
controlling the force as to make it accomplish th purpose.
It had long been believed that if the vibrations of air caused
by the voice in speaking could be reproduced at a distance by
means of electricity, the speech itself would be reproduced and
understood. How to do it was-the question.
Bell discovered that it could be done by gradually changing
the intensity of a continuous electric current, so as to make it
correspond exactly to the changes in the density of the air
caused by the sound of the voice. This was his art. He then

TELEPHONE CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

devised a way in which these changes of intensity could be
made and speech actually transmitted. Thus his art was put
in a condition for practical use.
In doing this, both discovery and invention, in the popular
sense of those terms, were involved; discovery in finding the
art, and invention in devising the means of making it useful.
For such discoveries and such inventions the law has given
disthe discoverer and inventor the right to a patent -as
coverer, for the useful art, process, method of doing a thing
he has found; and as inventor, for the means he has devised
to make his discovery one of actual value. Other inventors
may compete with him for the ways of giving effect to the discovery, but the new art he has found will belong to him and
those claiming under him during the life of his patent. If
another discovers a different art or method of doing the same
thing, reduces it to practical use, and gets a patent for his discovery, the new discovery will be the property of the new discoverer, and thereafter the two will be permitted to operate
each in his own way without interference by the other. The
only question between them will be whether the second discovery is in fact different from the first.
The patent for the art does not necessarily involve a patent
for the particular means employed for using it. Indeed, the
mention of any means, in the specification or descriptive portion of the patent, is only necessary to show that the art can
be used; for it is only useful arts -arts which may be used to
advantage -that can be made the subject of a patent. The
language of the statute is, that "any person who has invented
or discovered any new and useful art, machine, manufacture,
or composition of matter," may obtain a patent therefor.
Rev. Stat. ยง 4886. Thus, an art - a process - which is useful, is as much the subject of a patent, as a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter. Of this there can be no doubt,
and it is abundantly supported by authority. Corningv. Burden, 15 How. 252, 267; Coc rane v. Deener, 94: U; S. 780, 787,

What Bell claims is the a- of creating changes of intensity

Opinion of the Court.

in a continuous current of electricity, exactly corresponding to
the changes of density in the air caused by the vibrations
which accompany vocal or other sounds, and of using that
electrical condition thus created for sending and receiving
articulate speech telegraphically. For that, among other
things, his patent of 1876 was in our opinion issued; and
the point to be decided is, whether as such a patent it can
be sustained.
In O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, it was decided that a
claim in broad-terms (p. 86) for the use of the motive power
of the electric or galvanic current called "electro-magnetism,
however developed, for making or printing intelligible characters, letters, or signs, at any distances," although ". new applicatioi of that power" first made by Morse, was void, because
(p. 120) it was a claim "for a patent for an effect produced by
the use of electro-magnetism, distinct from the process or
machinery necessary to produce it;" but a claim (p. 85) for
"making use of the motive power of magnetism, when developed by the action of such current or currents, substantially
as set forth in the foregoing description, .
as means of
operating or, giving motion to machinery, which may be used
to imprint signals upon paper or other suitable material, or to
produce sounds in any desired manner, for the purpose of telegraphic communication at any distances," was sustained. The
effect of that decision was, therefore, that the use of magnetism
as a motive power, without regard to the particular process
with which it was connected in the patent, could not be
claimed, but that its use in that connection could.
In the present case the claim is not for the use of a current
of electricity in its natural state as it comes from the battery,
but for putting a continuous current in a closed circuit into a
certain specified condition suited to the transmission of vocal
and other sounds, and using it in that condition for that
purpose. So far as at present known, without this peculiai
change in its condition it will not serve as a medium for t.Le
transmission of speech, but with the change it will. Bell was
the first to disco-er this fact, and how to put such a current in
such a condition, and what he claims is its use in that condition

TELEPHONE CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

for that purpose, just as MIorse claimed his current in his condition for his purpose. We see nothing, in Mforse's case to
defeat Bell's claim; on the contrary, it is in all respects sustained by that authority. It may be that electricity cannot be
used at all for the transmission of speech except in the way
Bell has discovered, and that therefore, practically, his patent
gives him its exclusive use for that purpose, but that does not
make his claim one for the use of electricity distinct from the
particular process with which it is connected in his patent. It
will, if true, show more clearly the great importance of his
discovery, but it will not invalidate his patent.
But it is insisted that the claim cannot be sustained, because
when the patent was issued Bell had not in fact completed his
discovery. While it is conceded that he was acting on the
right principle and had adopted the true theory, it is claimed
that the discovery lacked that practical development which
was necessary to make it patentable. In the language of
counsel "there was still work to be done, and work calling
for the exercise of the utmost ingenuity, and calling for the
very highest degree of practical invention."
It is quite true that when Bell applied for his patent he had
never actually transmitted telegraphically spoken words so
that they could be distinctly heard and understood at the
receiving end of his line, but in his specification he did describe accurately and with admirable clearness his process,
that is to say, the exact electrical condition that must be
created to accomplish his purpose, and he also described, with
sufficient precision to enable one of ordinary skill in such matters to make it, a form of apparatus which, if used in the way
pointed out, would produce the required effect, receive the
words, and carry them to and deliver them at the appointed
place. The particular instrument -which he had and which he
used in his experiments did not, under the circumstances in
which it was tried, reproduce the words spoken, so that they
could be clearly understood, but the proof is abundant and of
the most convincing character, that other instruments, carefully constructed and made exactly in accordance with the
specification, without any additions whatever, have operated

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

and will operate successfully. A good mechanic of proper
skill in matters of the kind can take the patent aid, by following the specification strictly, can, without more, construct
an apparatus which, when used in the way pointed out, will
do all that it is claimed the method or process will do. Some
witnesses have testified that they were unable to do it. This
shows that they, with the particular apparatus they had and
the skill they employed in its use, were not successful; not
that others, with another apparatus, perhaps more carefully
constructed or more skilfully applied, would necessarily fail.
As was said in Loom Co. v. .Higgins,105 IT. S. 580, 586,-"when
the question is, whether a thing can be done or not, it is always
easy to find persons ready to show how not to do it." If one
succeeds, that is enough, no matter how many others fail.
The opposite results will show, that in the one case the apparatus used was properly made, carefully adjusted, with a
knowledge of what was required, and skilfully used, and that
in the others it was not.
The law does not require that a discoverer or inventor, in
order to get a patent for a process, must have succeeded in
bringing his art to the highest degree of perfection. It is
enough if he describes his method with sufficient clearness and
precision to enable those skilled in the matter to understand
what the process is, and if he points out some practicable way
of putting it into operation. This Bell did. He described
clearly and distinctly his process of transmitting speech telegraphically, by creating changes in the intensity of a continuous current or flow of electricity in a closed circuit, exactly
analogous to the changes of density in air occasioned by the
undulatory motion given to it by the human voice in speaking.
He then pointed out two ways in which this might be done:
one by the "vibration or motion of 'bodies capable of inductive action, or by the vibration of the conducting wire itself
in the neighborhood of such bodies; " and the other "by alternately increasing and diminishing the resistance of the circuit,
.or by alternately increasing and diminishing the power of the
battery." le then said he preferred to employ for his purpose
"an electro-magnet, .' . . having a coil upon only.one of

TELEPHONE CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

its legs," and he described the construction of the particu]ar
apparatus shown ii the patent as Fig. 7,in which ther electromagnet, or magneto met!iod, was employed. This was the
apparatus which he himself used without entirely satisfactory
results, but which Prof. Cross, ir. Watson, Dr. Blake, Prof.
Pope, and others testify has done, and will do, what was
claimed for it, and transmit speech successfully, but not so
well indeed as another constructed upon the principle of the
.,
microphone or the variable resistance method.
An effort was made in argument to confine the patent to
the magneto instrument, and such modes of creating electrical
undulations as could be produced by that form of apparatus,
the position being that such an apparatus necessarily implied
"a closed circuit incapable of being opened, and a continuous
current incapable of being intermittent." But this argument
ignores' the fact that the claim is, first, for the process, and,
second, for the apparatus. it is to be read, 1, as a claim for 'the
method of transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphicaly,
as herein described, by causing electrical undulations similar
in form to the vibrations of 'the air accompanying the said
vocal or other sounds, substantially as set forth;" and, 2, as
for "the apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds
telegraphically, as herein described, by causing electrical undulations,

.

.

.

substantially as set forth."

The method,

"as herein described," is to cause gradual changes in the intensity of the electric current used as the medium of transmission,
which shall be exactly analogous t6 the changes in the density
of the air, occasioned by the peculiarities in the shapes of the
undulations produced in speech, in the manner "substantially
as set forth;" that is to say, "by the vibration or motion of
bodies capable of inluctive action, or by the vibration of the
conducting wire itself in the neighborhood of such bodies,"
which is the magneto method; or "by alternately, increasing
and diminishing the resistance of the circuit, or by alternately
increasing and diminishing the power of the battery," which is
the variable resistance method. This is the process which has
been patented, and it may be operated in' either of the ways
set forth. The current must be kept closed to be used success-

Opinion of the Court.

fully, but this does not necessarily imply that it must be so
produced or so operated upon, as to be incapable of being,
opened. If opened it will fail to act for the time being, .and
the process will be interrupted; but there is nothing in the
patent which requires it to be operated by instruments which
are incapable of making the break.
The apparatus, "as herein described," which is included in
the claim; is undoubtedly one in which an electro-magnet is
employed, and constructed "substantially as set forth" in the
specification. One acting on the- variable resistance mode is
not described, further than to say that the vibration of the
conducting wire in mercury or other liquid included in the circuit occasions undulations in the current, and no other special
directions are given as td the manner in which it must be constructed. The patent is both for the magneto and variable
resistance methods, and for the particular magneto apparatus
which is described, or.its equivalent. There is no patent for
any variable resistance apparatus. It is undoubtedly true that
when Bell got his patent he thought the magneto method was
the best. Indeed, he said, in express terms, he preferred it,
but that does not exclude the use of the other if it turns out
to be the, most desirable way of using the process under any
circumstances. Both forms of apparatus operate on a closed
circuit by gradual changes of intensity, and not by alternately
making and breaking the circuit, or by sudden and instantaneous changes, and they each require to be so adjusted as to
prevent interruptions. If they break it is a fault, and the
process stops until the connection is restored.
It is again said, that the claim, if given this broad construction, is virtually "a claim for speech transmission by transmitting it; or, in other words, for all such doing of a thing as is
provable by doing it." It is true that Bell transmits speech
by transmitting it, and that long before he did so it was believed by scientists that it could be done by means of electricity, if the requisite electrical effect could be produced.
Precisely how that subtle force operates under Bell's treatment, or what form it. takes, no one can tell. All we know is
that he found out that, by changing the intensity of a contin-

Opinion of the Court.

uous current so as to make it correspond exactly with the
changes in the density of air caused by sonorous vibrations,
vocal and other sounds could be transmitted and heard at a
distance. This was the thing to be done, and Bell discovered
the way of doing it. He uses electricity as a medium for that
purpose, just as air is used within speaking distance. In effect
he prolong, the air vibrations by the use of electricity. No
one before him had found out how to use electricity with the
same effect. To use it with success it must be put in a certain
condition. What that condition was he was the first to discover, and with his discovery he astonished the scientific
world. Prof. Henry, one of the most eminent scientists of
the present century, spoke of it as "the greatest marvel hitherto achieved by the telegraph." The thing done by Bell was
"transmitting audible speech through long telegraphic lines,"
and Sir William Thomson, on returning to his home in England, in August or September, 1876, after seeing at the Centennial Exposition, in Philadelphia, what Bell had done and
could do by his process, spoke in this way of it to his countrymen: "Who can but admire the hardihood of invention which
devised such very slight means to realize the mathematical
conception, that, if electricity is to convey all the delicacies of
quality which distinguish articulate speech, the strength of its
current must vary continuously, as nearly as may be, in simple
proportion to the velocity of a particle.of air engaged in constituting the sounds." Surely a patent for such a discovery is
not to be confined to the mere m6ans he improvised to prove
the reality of his conception.
We come now to consider the alleged anticipation of Philipp
Reis. And here it is to be always kept in mind that the question is, not whether the apparatus devised by IReis to give
effect to his theory can be made, with our present knowledge,
to transmit speech, but whether Reis had in his time found
out the way of using it successfully for that purpose; not as
to the character of the apparatus, but as to the mode of treating the current of electricity on which the apparatus is to act,
so as to make that current a medium for receiving the vibrations of air created by the human voice in articulate speech at

540

one place, and in effect delivering them at the ear of a listener
in another place. Bell's patent is liot alone for the particular
apparatus he describes, but for the process that apparatus was
designed to bring into use. His patent would be quite as
good if he had actually used Reis's apparatus in developing
the process for which it was granted.
That :Reis knew what had to be done in order to transmit
speech by electricity is very apparent, for in his first paper he
said: "As soon as it is possible to produce, any where and in
any manner, vibrations whose curves shall be the same as
those of any given tone or combination of tones, we shall
receive the same impression as that tone or combination of
tones would have produced on us." Bourseul also knew it before Reis, for, in a communication published in a Paris journal
in 1854, he said: "Reproduce precisely these vibrations," to
wit, the vibrations made by the human voice in uttering syllables, "and -you will reproduce precisely these syllables."
Reis discovered how to reproduce musical tones; but he did
no more. He could sing through his apparatus, but he could
not talk. From the beginning to the end he has conceded
this. In his first paver he said: "Hitherto it has not been
possible to reproduce the tones of human speech with a distinctness sufficient for every one. The consonants are for the
most part reproduced pretty distinctly, but the vowels as yet
not in an equal degree. The cause of this I will attempt to
explain. According to the experiments of Willis, Helmholtz,
and others, vowel tones can be produced artificially, if the
vibrations of one body are from time to time augmented by
those of another, something as follows: An elastic spring is
set in vibration by the blow of a tooth on a toothed wheel;
the first vibration is the greatest, and each subsequent one is
smaller than the preceding. If, after.a few vibra.tion7 of this
kind, (the spring not coming to a rest in the mean time,) the
toothwheel imparts a new stroke, the following vibration will
be again a maximum, and so on. The pitch of the tone produced in this way depends upon the number of vibrations in
a given time, but the character of the tone upon the number
of swellings in the same time.

-

probably produce the vowels in the, same manner, through the
combined action of the upper and lower vocal chords, or of
these latter and the cavity of the mouth. Ify apparatus
reproduces the number of vibrations, but with an intensity
much less than that of the original ones; though, as I have
reason to believe, to a certain degree proportional among
themselves. But in the case. of these generally small variations, the difference between large and small vibrations is
more difficult to perceive than in the case of the original
waves, and the vowel is therefore more or less indistinct."
And again: "I have succeeded in constructing an apparatus
with which I am enabled to reproduce the tones of various
instruments, and even to a certain extent the human voice."
No one of the many writers whose papers are found in the
records claim more than this for Reis or his discoveries. Although his first paper was published in 1861, and Bell did not
appear as a worker in the same field of scientific research until
nearly fifteen years afterwards, no advance had been made,
by the use of what he had contrived or of his method, towards
the great end to be accomplished. He caused his instruments
to be put on the market for sale, and both he and those whom
he employed for that purpose took occasion to call attention
to them by. prospectus, catalogue, and otherwise, and to
describe what they were and what they would do. In, his
own prospectus, which was published in 1865 and attached
to the apparatus, he says : "Every apparatus consists .
of two parts, the telephone proper and the receiver.
These two parts are placed at such a distance from each other
that singing or toning of a imusical instrument can be heard
in no other way from one station to the other except through
the apparatus." And, ":Besides the human voice there can
be reproduced (according to my experience) just as well the
tones of good organ-pipes from F-c, and those of the piano'!,

and Edinburgh, in 1867, it is said, in speaking of the telephone: "This is-an instrument for telegraphing notes of the
same pitch. Any noise prodticing a single vibration of the air,
when repeated regularly a certain number of times in the
second (not less than thirty-two), produces, as is well known,
A person when singing any note
a musical sound. . .
causes the air to vibrate so many times per second, the number
varying with the pitch of the note he sings, the higher the
note the greater being the number of vibrations. If we then
by any means can get these vibrations to break a closed circuit,
the note sung at one station can be reproduced,
at least so far as pitch is concerned, at another. IReis's telephone (invented 1861) accomplishes this in the following way,"
which is then described.
But it is needless to quote further from the evidence on this
branch of the case. It. is not contended that Reis had ever
succeeded in actually transmitting speech, but only that his
instrument was capable of it if he had known how. :e did
not know how, and all his experiments in that direction were
failures. With the help of Bell's la'er discoveries in 1875 we
now know why he failed.
As early as 1851 Bourseul, in his communication which has
already been referred to, had said, substantially, that if the
vibrations of air produced by the human voice in articulate
speech could be reproduced by means of electricity at a distance, the speech itself would be reproduced and heard there.
As a means of stimulating inquiry to that end he called attention to the principle on which the electric telegraph was based
and suggested an application of that principle to such a purpose. iHe said: 4The electric telegTaph is based on thefollowing principle: A n electric current, passing through a metallic
wire, circulates through a coil around a piece of soft iron,
which it converts into a magnet. The moment the current
stops, the piece of iron beases to be a magnet. This magnet,
which takes the name of electro-magnet, can thus in turn attract and then release a movable plate, which, by its to-andfro movement, produces the conventional signals employed in
telegraphy." Then, after referring to the mode in which speech

Opinion of -the Court.

is transmitted by the vibrations of the air, he said: "Suppose that a man speaks near a movable disk, sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations, of the voice; that this disk.
alternately makes and breaks the connection with a battery;
you may have at a distance another disk which will simultaneously execute the same vibrations."
That IReis was working all the time, from the beginning to
the end of his experiments, upon the principle of the telegraph
as thus suggested by Bourseul, is abundantly proven. Thus,
in his first paper, after describing his cubical block apparatus,
he says: " If now tones or combinations of tones axe produced
in the neighborhood of the block, so that sufficiently powerful
waves enter the opening a, then these sounds cause the membrane b to vibrate. At the first condensation the hammer-like
wire d is pushed back; at the rarefaction it cannot follow the
retreating membrane, and the current traversing the strips remains broken, until the membrane forced by a, new condensation again presses the strip .
.
against d. In this way
each sound wave causes a breaking and closing of the current.
At each closing of the ciruit the atoms of the iron wire inside
the distant spiral are moved away from each other; on breaking the circuit these atoms seek to regain their position of equilibrium. When this happens, in consequence of the reciprocal
actions of elasticity and inertia, a number of vibrations are produced, and they give the longitudinal sound of the rod. This
is the case if the making and breaking of the current occur
with comparative slowness. If they occur more rapidly than
the oscillations of the iron core, due to its elasticity, the atoms
cannot complete their course. . The paths described become
shorter in proportion as the interruptions are more frequent,
but then are just as numerous as these. The iron wireno longer gives its longitudinal normal tone, but a tone whose pitch
corresponds to the number of interruptions in a given time;
this is, the same as saying that the rod reproduces the tone
impressed upon the interrupter."
Such was the beginning, and it was maintained persistently
to the end as well by Reis as by those who availed themselves
of what he was doing. To this the Reis-Legat apparatus

Opinion of the Court.

forms no exception, for ii the paper describing it Legat says:
"The operation of the apparatus described is .s follows: When
at rest the galvanic circuit is closed. When the air which is
in the tube a b of the apparatus is alternately condensed and
rarefied by speaking into it,, (or by singing o.r introducing the
tones of an instrument,),a movement of the membrane closipg
the smaller opening of the tube is produced, corresponding to
such condensation or rarefaction. The lever c d follows the
movements of the membrane, and opens and closes the galvanic circuit at d g, so that at each condensation of the air in
the tube the circuit is opened, -and at each rarefaction the circuit is closed. In consequence of this operation the electromagnet of the apparatus, in accordance with the condensations
and rarefactions of the column of air in the tube . . . is cor-

respondingly demagnetized and magnetized, and the armature
of the magnet is set into vibrations like those of the membrane
in the transmitting apparatus." We have not had our attention
called to a single item of evidence which tends in any way to
show that Reis or any one who wrote about him had it in his
mind that anything else than the intermittent current caused
by the opening and closing of the circuit could be used to do
what was wanted. No one seems to have thought that there
could be another way. All recognized the fact that the "minor differences in the original vibrations" had not been satisfactorily reproduced, but they attributed it to the imperfect
mechanism of the apparatus used, rather than to any fault in
the principle on which the operation was made to depend. It.was left for Bell to discover that the failure was due not
to workmanship but to the principle which was adopted as the
basis'of what had to be done. He found that what -he called
the intermittent current-one caused by alternately opening
and.closing the circuit- could not be made under any circumstances to reproduce the delicate forms of the air vibrations
caused by the human voice in articulate speech, but that the
true way was to operate on an unbroken current by increasing
and diminishing its intensity.. This he called a vibratory or
undulatory current, not because the current Was supposed to'
actually take that form, but because it expressed with suffi-

TELEPHONE CASES.*
Opinion 'of the 'Court.

cient accuracy his idea of a current which;was subjected to
gradual changes of intensity exactly analogous to the changes
of density in the air occasioned by its vibratidis. -Such was
his discovery, and it was new. 'Reis never thought' of it, and
he failed to transmit 'speech telegraphically. ' Bell did, and' he
succeeded. , Under such circumstanbes 'it is impossible to hold
that what Reis did was an anticipation of 'the discovery of Bell.
To follow Reis is to fail, but to follow Bell'is to succeed. The
difference between the two is just-the diffeIrence between failure and success. If Reis had' kept on he might' have found
out the way to succeed, but he stopped and failed., Bell' took
up his work and carried it on to a successful result.
As to what is shown to have been written and done by Dr.
Van der Weyde, it is only necessary to say that 'he copied
Reis, and it was not until after Bell's success that he found
out how to use a Reis instrument "so 'as to make it transmit
speech. Bell taught him what to do to accomplish that
purpose.
So as to James W. 'McDonough. We presume that 'it will
not be claimed that he is entitled to more than he asked for
in his application for a patent, filed April 10, 1876, and there
a "circuit breaker," so adjusted as to "break the connection
by the vibrations of the membrane," is made one of the- elements of his invention. The Patent Office was clearly right
in holding that he had been anticipated by Reis.
The patents of Cromwell Fleetwood Varley, of London,
England, granted on June 2, 1868, and the other October 8,
1870, were for "improvements in electric telegraphs." The
objects of the invention covered by the first were "to cut off
the disturbance arising from earth currents, to obtain a' high
speed of signalling through long circuits, and, should the conductor become partially exposed, to preserve it from being
eaten away by electrolytic action;" and .the object of the
second was the "increase of the transmitting power of telegraph circuits, by enabling more than one operator to signal
independent messages at the same time, upon one and the same
wire, to and from independent stations." 'While this patentee
in his specification says, "by my invention I superpose upon
VOL. cxxvi-35

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

the currents used for working the ordinary telegraphs rapid
undulations or waves, which do not practically alter the mechanical or chemical power of the ordinary signal currents,"
and that "these undulations are made to produce distinct and
independent audible or other signals so long as these undulations are produced, whether ordinary signal currents be flowing or not," it is apparent that he uses the terms "undulations" and "waves" in an entirely different sense from Bell,for his patent implies operation on the principle of the electric,
telegraph; that is to say, by making and breaking the circuit.
A Morse key, or s6mething equivalent, is to be used; and
besides, in the descriptive portion of the patent, it is. said:
"When the current is flowing through the coils of the electromagnet the horns of the fork k are drawn apart and the spring
1'loses its contact; then, as the attraction of the magnet ceases,
the horns of the fork spring back; this remakes the contact,
and so a continual tremor is communicated to the tuning fork."
In short, there is nothing in any part of the specification to
iindicate that the patentee had in his mind "undulations" resulting "from gradual changes of intensity exactly analogous
to the changes in the density of air occasioned by simple pendulous vibrations," which was Bell's discovery, and on which
his art rests. Varley's purpose was to superpose, that is to.
say, place upon the ordinary signal current another, which, by
the action of the make and break principle of the telegraph,
would do the work he wanted.
Another alleged anticipation is that of Daniel Drawbaugh.
Bell got his patent March 7,1876, and the fortunate accident which led to his discovery occurred June 2, 1875. Active
litigation to enforce his patented rights was begun by his company on the 12th of September, 1878, with a suit in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts, against Richard A. Dowd. This suit was defended by
the Western Union Telegraph Company, and vigorously contested. The answer was filed November 4, 1878, setting up
alleged ..anticipations by Gray, Edison, Dolbear and others.
The record fills twelve hundred printed pages, but before a
decision was reached the case was compromised and a decree

Opinion of the Court.

entered by consent. The litigation ended at some time in the
latter part of the year 1879. The last deposition was taken
on the 19th of September in that year.
The next contested suit was brought in the same court on
the 28th of July, 1880, against Albert Spencer and others.
An answer was filed in this case September 6, 1880, and depositions afterwards taken, some of those in the Dowd suit being
used in this by stipulation. On the 27th of June, 1881, a decision was announced by Judge Lowell sustaining the patent,
upon which a decree was entered.
On the 14th of November, 1879, Abner G. Tisdel filed in
the Patent Office an application for a patent for "a new and
useful improvement in speaking-telephones," and oi the 18th
of November, 1879, Frank A. Klemm also filed an application
for a patent for "a new and useful improvement in telephonetransmitters." These inventions were transferred by assignment to Ernest Marx and Frank A. Klemm of New York
City, Moritz Loth of Cincinnati, and Simon Wolf of Washington. On the 6th of March, 1880, these parties entered into
a mutual agreement to the effect that "each and all of their
interests in said improvements and inventions, and the letterspatent to be issued therefor, shall be merged and consolidated
as common stock in a corporate body, under the laws of either
of the States of Ohio, New York, or the general laws of the
United States, relating to the formation of incorporations in
the District of Columbia, or of such other States or Territories
as may be found necessary hereafter." This agreement was
recorded in the Patent Office March 10, 1880.
On the 6th of May, 1880, Edgar W. Chellis, a merchant of
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, M. W. Jacobs, a lawyer at the
same place, and Lysander Hill, a lawyer then residing in
Washington, in the District of Columbia, made an arrangement with Daniel Drawbaugh by which they were to become
jointly interested with him in his alleged telephone inventions,
each to have a quarter interest. Nothing was paid for this,
but each of the parties was to have one-fourth of anything
that should be realized from the enterprise. On the 24th of
May, 1880, Simon Wolf, one of the parties interested in the

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

Klemm and Tisdel inventions, visited Harrisburg on business
with Chellis in reference to telephone matters. On the 18th
of May, four days before this visit, a patent was issued to
Wolf and his associates upon the invention of Tisdel. While
Wolf was in Harrisburg negotiations were begun with Chellis
for a transfer of the Drawbaugh inventions to the owners of
those of Klemm and Tisdel. These negotiations resulted in
a conditional contract of the 22d of June, by reason of which
Chellis, Jacobs, Hill, and Drawbaugh went to Washington,
and there on the 21st of July, 1880, Drawbaugh, claiming to
' have invented certain new and useful improvements in the
transmission of vocal speech, and the apparatus to be used for
such purpose, for which I am about to make application for
letters-patent of the United States," assigned to Klemm, Marx,
Wolf, and Loth "the full and exclusive right to the said invention as fully set fortb and described in the specification
prepared and executed by me, dated the 21st day of July,
1880, preparatory to obtaining letters-patent of the United
-States therefor," and he, at the same time, and by the same
instrument, authorized and, requested the Commissioner of
Patents to issue the patent to his assignees, "each. as assignee
of one-fourth part." The specification referred to in the
assignment has not been put in evidence in any of- the cases.
In the course of taking the testimony it was called for by the
Bell Company, but the counsel'for the opposite party refused
to produce either the original or a copy from the Patent Office.
The assignment was recorded in the Patent Office July 22,
1880, and in the official digest of assignments the following
notation appears: "' About to make appl'n. Spe'n dated July
21, 1880.'
On the morning of July 22, 1880, the following appeared in
the CincinnatiCommercial, a newspaper printed at Cincinnati,
Ohio:
"TELEPHONE COmBIIATION.

as well as wealth of prospect, renders it a subject of national
interest. A company of leading business men has been formed,
that has -bought up all the telephone patents antedating those
now in use, and known as the Bell, Gray, and Edison patents.
The company is composed of leading business men from all
parts of the country, Cincinnati being largely represented and
interested. The cash capital of the company is $5,000,000,
with headquarters in New York, and in about sixty days they
will open up the telephone, which will certainly result in the
driving out of all telephones in the market, save the ones they
hold, or else the compelling the Gray, Bell, and Edison lines
to pay the new company a munificent royalty. It appears
from the testimony now on file and in the possession of the
new company, which is conclusive and exhaustive, that the
inventor of the telephone is a poor mechanic, living near
Harrisburg, Pa., named Daniel Drawbaugh. Owing to his
poverty, he was unable to push his patent on the market.
The new company have secured and are sole possessors of this
invention, antedating those now in use. They are also owners
of four patents for telephones issued to Mr. Klemm, of New
York. A large number of capitalists were here to-day to see
the filing of the application, and they assert, with a ppsitiveness that is almost convincing, that it will not be long till
they have entire charge of the telephones, 'not only in this
country but in the world, and that they will be able to establish lines by which messages can be transmitted for almost
a song.
"Mr. Lipman Levy, of the law firm of Moulton, Johnson &
Levy, of Cincinnati, was here to-day, in the interest of the
Cincinnati parties, who, as already stated, are among the
most prominent financial men of our city."
Afterwards, on the 23d of August, 1880, the following
appeared in the Joural of Commerce, a newspaper printed
in the city of New York:
"A N w TELEPHONE ComIPANY. - A company has recently
been formed in this city with a capital of $5,000,000, for the
purpose of manufacturing telephones. The company is to be
known as The People's Telephone Company, and a number

Opinion -of the- Court.

of leading capitalists in this city and Cincinnati are interested
in it. The telephones are to be manufactured .under the
patents of Frank A. Klemm and Abner G. Tisdel, and the
application for patents of Daniel Drawbaugh, of Eberly's
Mills, Cumberland County, Pa., filed July 21, 1880. It is
claimed by those interested in the new enterprise that Drawbaugh ii really the inventor of the telephone, and had completed one years before Professor IBell c.r any one else had
manufactured one. He was, however, in very humble circumstances, and his neighbors who knew of his experiments looked
upon him as a harmless lunatic. He continued improving his
original telephone, and it is claimed that the one which the
new company proposes to furnish is superior to any now in
use. The company has fitted up a factory in Brooklyn, and
in three months will be prepared to supply 1000 of the new
telephones. As soon as operations are actively commenced,
it is expected that legal proceedings will be begun against the
new company by the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company,
which holds most of the existing patents, and a long and
interesting legal fight is anticipated."
. On the 30th of August, 1880, the People's Telephone Company was incorporated under the general laws of New York,
with an authorized capital stock of $5,000,000, for "manufacturing, constructing, owning, furnishing, letting and selling
telephones, and the apparatus used therewith, under the
inventions and patents of Abner G. Tisdel, Frank A. Klemm,
Daniel Drawbaugh, and other inventions and patents which
may hereafter be assigned to said company," and on the 4th
of September, 1880, Klemm, Loth, Marx, and Wolf, in consideration of $4,999,550, represented by 99,991 shates of stock,
assigned and transferred to that company all their interest in
the Klemm, Tisdel, and Drawbaugh inventions, those of
Drawbaugh being described as "the . inventions in telephones
made by Daniel Drawbaugh of Eberly's Mills, Cumberland
County, in the State of Pennsylvania, for which application
for patents was made on or about the 21st day of July, 1880,
and which was assigned to us on the [twenty-] first day of
July, 1880, as more particularly appears in a deed of assign-

TELEPHONE DASES.
Opinion of the Cout.

inent recorded in the United States Patent Office in Liber W.
25, page 85, in the Book of Transfers of Patents."
For the assignment from Drawbaugh to Klemm, ]Marx,
Loth, and Wolf $20,000 was paid in money to Chellis, Jacobs,
Hill, and Drawbaugh, and they were also to have a certain
amount of the stock of the proposed corporation when formed.
What amount they actually got Chellis, who was sworn as a
witness in the case, declined to tell, but he admitted it was
large.
At this time, and in this way, the attention of the general
public was called for the first time to the fact that Drawbaugh
claimed to have anticipated Bell in the discovery of the telephone. Bell's success had been proclaimed more than four
years before at the C~ntennial Exposition in Philadelphia.
In the meantime inventions in aid of his discovery had been
multiplied. According to the testimony of Park Benjamin,
more than one hundred patents had been issued and indexed
under the word "telephone." Numerous interferences had
been declared and considered at the Patent Office. Gray,
Edison, Dolbear, and -othershad either claimed for themselves,
or others had claimed for them, priority of invention and discovery, and Bell had thus far been sustained as against them
all. Blake had perfected his microphone apparatus, and Bell's
patent had become a great commercial success.
The People's Company either began or threatened to begin
operations under its charter, and on the 20th of October, 1880,
the Bell Company brought suit against it in the Circuit Court
of the United States for the Southern District of New York,
to prevent any infringement of the Bell patents. In the bill
it was alleged "that telephone exchanges now exist in more
than two hundred and seventy-five towns and cities of the
United States, and in every State thereof, and exist in substantially every city in the United States having more than
15,000 inhabitants, and in many smaller places;" "that there
are now in use more than 100,000 electric speaking-telephones
licensed by and paying royalty to" the Bell Company; "that
the owners of said Bell patents, and those who now are or
heretofore have been licensed by them, have devoted great

telephone. lines and systems, and telephonic appliances, ahd
have constructed many thousand miles of telephone lines for
use with telephones owned by" the Bell Company, "and

defendants, or F. A. Klemm, A. G. Tisdel, and D. Drawbaugh
have done has contributed in any substantial way to'
the development of the telephone or the introdu.ction thereof
into use." The bilf then avers that Klemm, Marx, Loth, and
Wolf, having becme the owners of the Klemm and Tisdel
improvements, and having heard that Drawbaugh "claimed
that he had made some experiments relating to electric speaking-telephones, (which experiments, if made, were incomplete,
imperfect, unfruitful, and long before abandoned,) entered
into an arrangement with him to set up and claim that he
was the first inventor of the speaking-telephone, and to make
application for a patent therefor-; and thereafter, alleging and
pretending that said Drawbaugh was the original and first
inventor of the electric, speaking-telephone, and that electric
speaking-telephones had not before such application been in
public use or on sale for more than two years, with the knowledge and consent of Drawbaugh, they did, on or about the
21st day of July, 1880, induce him to .make and, cause to be
filed in the Patent Office of the United States an application
for a patent to issue to them as assignees of the said Drawbaugh, as the first and original inventor of the electric speaking-telephone, the said defendants -yell knowing at the time
that electric speaking-telephones had been in public use by"
the Bell Company and its licensees "for more than two years
before said application." It was then further alleged that if
Drawbaugh had ever made his pretended inventions they
"have not been by him, or-any one claiming under him,
introduced into public use, and that knowledge thereof has
been withheld from your orators and the public, except so far
as they have been disclosed within the three months last past
by certain newspaper publications."

.TELEPHONE ICASES.
Opinion of the Court.

To this bill the People's Company filed an answer in December, 1880, or January, 1881. The record does not show the
precise date. In this answer it was said that Drawbaugh was
"the original and first inventor and discoverer of the art of
communicating articulate speech between distant places by
voltaic and magneto electricity," and that "long prior to the
alleged inventions by" Bell, Gray, and Edison he, "then and
now residing at Eberly's Mills, constructed and operated practical working electric speaking-telephones at said Eberly's
Mills, and exhibited their successful operation to a great number of other persons resident in his vicinity and elsewhere;"
that his telephones, as then constructed and operated, "contained all the material and substantial parts and inventions
patented" in the patents of Bell, and "also other important
and valuable inventions in electric and magneto telephony, and
were fully capable of transmitting, and were actually used for
transmitting, articulate vocal sounds and speech between distant points by means of electric currents; that some of the
original machines and instruments, invented, miade, used and
exhibited to many others long prior to the said alleged inventions of Bell, or either of them, are still in existence, and capable of successful practical use, and are identified by a large
number of persons who personally tested and used them, and
knew of their practical operation and use, in the years 1870,
1871, 1872, 1873, 1874, and both prior and subsequently
thereto; that certainly more than fifty, and probably not
less than one hundred, persons, or even more, were cognizant
of said Drawbaugh's invention and use of said' telephones, and
of his claim to be the original and first inventor thereof prior
to the alleged inventions of said Bell, or either of them; that
said Drawbaugh, for more than ten years prior to the year
1880, was miserably poor, in debt, with a large and helpless
family dependent on his daily labor, and was from such cause
alone utterly unable to patent his invention, or caveat it, or
manufacture and introduce it on the market; thit said Drawbaugh never abandoned his said invention, nor acknowledged
the claims of any other person or persons thereto, but always
persisted in his claims to it, and intended to patent it as soon

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

as he could procure the necessary means therefor; that said
Drawbaugh never acquiesced in the public use of said Bell,
Gray, Edison, Blake or other telephones, nor in the claims of
the alleged inventors thereof, nor gave his consent to such
use." It is then said that Drawbaugh, after finding by experiment that his invention was capable of successful working,
"conceived that its range and capacity for usefulness to the
public might be very greatly enlarged; that many improvements of great value might be made and added to it, which,
without departing from its principle, might increase- its value
to himself and to the public, and therefore set himself at work
to discover and invent such improvements; that he discovered and invented some of said additional improvements
prior to any alleged invention by Bell; and that notwithstanding his embarrassed and impoverished pecuniary condition, and his utter want of proper mechanical tools, materials,
and appliances to conduct such work, he labored with all
reasonable diligence to perfect and adapt his said improvements, and did finally, in due exercise of such reasonable
diligence, perfect and adapt the same; and that in so far as
the said Bell has incorporated such improvements in his said
two patents, or either of them, he, the said Bell, has surreptitiously and unjustly obtained a patent or patents for that
which was in fact first invented by Drawbaugh, who was
using reasonable diligence in perfecting and adapting the
same, and, therefore, the patent or patents of the said Bell
therefor is or are invalid and void." It is then said that "the
defendant in good faith, and relying upon its legal rights,
.

.

.

caused applications to be made and filed in the Patent

Office for letters patent on the inventions of the said Daniel
Drawbaugh, with the intention of procuring interference proceedings to be instituted, in accordance with the statute, against
the patents of said Bell, and the pending applications of said
Gray, Edison, and others, in order that said Drawbaugh may
be adjudged by the Commissioner of Patents to be, as he
rightfully is, the original and first inventor of the electric
speaking-telephone, and may be adjudged entitled to receive
a patent or patents therefor."

TELEPHONE CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

The People's Company began taking depositions on the 19th
of April, 1881, but Drawbaugh himself did not appear as a
witness until December 7, 1881. After that time others were
examined, and when the proofs were closed between three and
four hundred witnesses had been produced whose testimony
was taken and put into the record to establish the priority of
Drawbaugh's invention. This testimony, as is now claimed,
shows the story of that invention to have been as follows:
"Early conception and experiments with the continuous
current, 1862, 1866, and 1867.
"Tea-cup transmitter and receiver, 1866 and 1867.
"Tumbler and tin-cup and mustard can, (' F' and 'B,')
1867 and 1869.
"Improvement on 'B,' (I 0,') 1869, 1870.
"Further improvement upon 'C,' and the more perfect
magneto instrument 'I,' 1870, 1871.
"Mouthpiece changed to centre and adjusting screw inserted, (Exhibit 'A,') 1874.
"' D ' and 'E,' perfectly adjusted and finished magneto
instruments, January and February, 1875.
"' L, ' M, ' G,' and '0 ,' from February, 1875, to August,
1876.
"'H August, 1876.
"J' I N,' and ' ,' 1878."
This statement of the Drawbaugh claim we have quoted
from the brief of counsel appearing in his behalf, and his
success in the litigation has been placed, as we understand it,
both in the answer and in the argument, on the truth or falsehood of what is thus set forth.
The letters IF," "B," etc., in the statement refer to exhibits in the cause, being certain instruments claimed to have
been made and used by Drawbaugh in the progress of his
work and preserved until now. The original tea-cup instrument was not produced, but Drawbaugh in his deposition
gave what he said was a drawing, showing how it had been

Opinion of the Court.

how they were originally constructed, or what the process was
by which sound was transmitted when they were used.^ All
any of the witnesses could say. on that subject was that they
had used one or more of the different instruments at Drawbaugh's shop, had heard sounds and sometimes spoken words
through them, and that Drawbaugh told them the sound was.
carried on the wire by electricity. There was nothing whatever produced.in print or in writing on the subject; not even
a memorandum or a drawing of any kind. And there is noth-'
ing in the testimony to show that Drawbaugh ever told any
one how his earlier instruments were made, or what his
process was, until he was called as a witness in December,
1881, and explained it in his testimony. This was nearly
twenty years, according to the present claim, after he had
begun his experiments, nearly seven after he had made and
used "D " and "E," " perfectly adjusted and finished magneto
instruments," and more than five after " L," " A[ ," " G ),"
" 0 ,
H
and " " had been constructed and kept in his shop. It was
also nearly six years after the date of Bell's patent, more than
five years after the success of his discovery had been proclaimed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, four
after his process had got into public use, three after it had
become an established success, and two after he had brought
his first suit for the establishment of his rights against Dowd,
who represented the Western Union Telegraph Company, to a
successful termination.
Under these circumstances it becomes important to consider
the conduct of Drawbaugh in reference to his alleged invention
during this twenty years of eventful history as connected with
the discovery and use of telephones. If his present claim is
true his experiments began almost as far back as those of Reis,
and he had in his shop at Eberly's Mills, within three miles of
Harrisburg, telephones that were substantially perfect months
before Bell, on the 2d of June, 18'75, got the clue to his subsequent discoveries- It is conceded that "D " and " E," made,
as is claimed, in February, 1875, are substantially as good
magneto instruments as any Bell had used before December,
1881, and "L," "M," " G," " 0," and "H," all of which it is

claimed were constructed by August, 1876, and some in February, 1875, are as good or nearly as good microphones as
those of Blake, which were not invented until 1878. This is
the theory of Drawbaugh's defence as it is set forth in the
answer and in the argument, and by it his case must stand or
fall. The claim is that the discovery of the process was complete, and that perfect telephones had been made and were in
a condition for use a year and more before Bell got his patent.
Drawbaugh was, when he gave his deposition, fifty-four
years of age, and had lived all his life at or near Eberly
Mills, a small village near Harrisburg. He was a skilful and
ingenious mechanic, and if he made "D" and "E," and the
instruments which came after them, at the time it is said he
did, he had good tools and good materials in 1875 and 1876,
and was capable of doing the best of work. He was also somewhat of an inventor, and had some knowledge of electricity.
According to the testimony he was an enthusiast on the subject
of his "talking machine," and showed it freely to his neighbors and people from the country when they visited his shop.
The Centennial Exposition was opened at Philadelphia in
May, 1876, and Drawbaugh visited it on 'the 17th of October,
1876, remaining four or five days. Before he went he had
heard, as he says, that some one besides himself had invented
a speaking telephone, which he had the impression was on exhibition there. If what he now claims is true, he had then on

hand in his shop Exhibits "ID," C ," "L ," ccf," "
and "H," all of them good instruments of their kind, and
capable of transmitting speech, and some of them but just finished. Bell's apparatus had been exhibited to the Board of
Judges in June before, and had attracted marked attention.
The matter was much discussed in the public press, and yet it
never seems to have occurred to Drawbaugh to take any of his
telephones with him when he went, although they were small
in size, and some, or all of them, could have been carried without serious inconvenience.
When giving his testimony he was examined in chief as to
that visit, and this is what he said on the subject of telephones:

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

"Q. 386. Did you attend the-Centennial Exhibition, at
Philadelphia, in the year 1876? A. Yes, sir; I did.
"Q. 387. Can you give the date on which you went there?
A. I can by reference to a book. It was October 17, 1876.
The 17th was a day on which I dated a letter from Philadelphia, while I was there on that visit.
"'Q. 388. How long did your visit there last? A. About
four or five days, to the best of my recollection.
"Q. 389. Who went with you on that visit? A. Mr. George
Leonard.
"Q. 390. Was that the only visit to the Centennial Exhibition that you made? A. Yes, sir; it was.
"Q. 391. At the time that you went there, or before that
time, had you heard that somebody else besides yourself had
invented a speaking telephone -or a telephone? A. Yes, sir;
some time before that, I don't remember how long, but not a
great while.
"Q. 392. When you went there, did you suppose it would
be on exhibition there? A. I don't remember whether I had
heard that it was on exhibition or not; but I got the impression some way that it was on exhibition.
"Q. 393. While you were there at the Centennial, did you
see any telephones, or make an effort to see any there? A.
Yes, sir; I made an effort and seen an instrument called a telephone, and supposed it to be the instrument spoken of- the
one of which I had heard. I was looking and had made some
inquiry, and was directed or came to a portion of the building
where I saw on a counter some man's telephone, the name I
don't remember. At that time, or several times that I called,
there was no one there to attend to it. I spoke to another
party that'had something else on exhibition -I don't recollect
what it was -just near by, and I asked him whether there
was any one there to attend, or to show the instruments. I
was informed then, there was no one there to show them.
"Q. 394. If you remember, please state what kind of an
instrument it was that you saw there, and state what information you were ableto obtain there regarding it and its mode of
operation. A. There was a number of instruments placed on

Opinion of' the Court.

to a raised portion - something like a shelf. That is, it resembled something like pigeon-holes, a box open in front, and each
instrument at the back of it had an electro-magnet. The number of instruments I don't remember. I, don't remember of
counting them. If I am not mistaken, there may have been a
dozen or more, perhaps; some were larger than others. I
could not give you a much better description than that. I
couldn't get any information about them.- This attendant
made some remarks about the instruments, but he didn't
understand them, and couldn't explain them. I was several
feet from where the instruments were. They were placed it occurs to me- on a raised place like a shelf, just'about high
enough for a man to speak into; that is the way it looked to
me. I did not go in behind the counter to examine them,
although there was an opening to go in by; ,because I did not
like to make too free, as there was no one there.
"Q. 395. Did you see any circulars lying around there referring to these instruments, or other advertisements of them?
A. I don't remember about that; it may have been.
" Q. 396. What was your impression as to the character of
the instruments, when you finally left them? A. I was impressed with the idea that they were instruments to telegraph
by sounds. A certain sound to represent a certain letter of
the alphabet. I am not certain how I got the idea, or
whether any person told me that at the time, but that is the
idea that I had. When I said certain sounds, I meant that
sounds of a different pitch would represent different letters.
'IQ. 397. Do you know whether that was 'Gray's Harmonic Telegraph' that you saw there or not? A. It didn't
say 'telegraph;' I am confident it was called 'telephone.'
I didn't see the working parts of the interior, except the
electro-magnets. I took the name of the man and his address
on a piece of paper, and put it in my pocket, but I don't know
what became of it. I don't know whether it was 'Gray's
Harmonic Telegraph,' or not.
" Q. 398. Did you see any tuning forks about it? A. I did
not."
That was all he did during his entire visit to ascertain

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court:

whether any one besides himself had actually antered upon
this then new and interesting field'of invention and discovery.
He spoke to no one about what 'he had done himself, and he
made no special effort to find out'whether that whilh was on
exhibition was in any respect like what he had at home. Neitner did he when he got home, so far~as the records show, say
anything to his neighbors or visiting friends about what he
had seen or heard. -He had apparently lost all interest in
"talking machines."
Not so, however, with his other inventions. The 'testimony
shows that during the early part of 1876, he was much occupied
in building an electric clock, which he thought of exhibiting at
the Centennial. This he did not do, however, but -either just
before he went to Philadelphia, or soon after, Rufus E. Shapley, a jeweller of Mechanicsburg, went by his' invitation, or on
his suggestion, to Eberly's Mills to look at the clock which he
had made. Soon afterwards the clock was taken to Shapley's
store' in Mechanicsburg, and on the 8th. of November, 1876,
Drawbaugh by an instrument in writing transferred to Shapley a half-interest in the "clock I am getting Up, th6 said R.
E. Shapley to pay for, patenting the same." Shapley had then
two thousand dollars in money which iDrawbaugh was anxious
to have him invest 'in that business, and, the clock was taken
by him to his shop so that it might be examined with that end
in view if it should prove to be useful. โข Some time afterwards
it was taken 'back-to Eberly's Mills, where it remained until
April 1, 1878, or thereabouts, when a clock cbmpany was
formed, and that clock, or another one substantially like it,
was taken about the country for exhibition. For this Draw:baugh was paid five hundred dollars, with aii interest in the
profits, and on the 20th- of September, 1878, he applied for a
patent for "improvement in earth batteries for electric clocks,"
which was issued January 14, 1879, to the members of the
clock company. The enterprise does not seem to have been
productive of any great success.
In- November or December, 1878, while this clock Was on
exhibition at Harrisburg, Drawbaugh was introduced to Edgar
W. Chellis. He had with him-at the time a "wooden model

Opinion of the Court.

of a faucet" that he wanted Chellis and another man to take
eici a third interest in. An arrangement was afterwards
made by which Chellisrgot a two-thirds interest, he paying for
it two hundred and fifty dollars, January 7,1879. On the 14th
of the same month Drawbaugh filed in the Patent Office an
application for a patent for an' " improvement in rotary measuring faucets," Chellis to hace a two-thirds interest. After
this application an interference was declared, March 29, 1879,
between Drawbaugh and David A. Hauck, who had filed a
conflicting application January 17. In his preliminary statement pon this interference Drawbaugh said that he had conceived the idea of his faucets and sketched them late in the
fall of 1876; that he made a working model in the spring of
1877, and actually tested it then, but the Patent Office model
was not completed until about the 1st of November, 1878.
The case was closely contested, but finally decided in favor of
Drawbaugh, January 15, 1880. The patent was granted to
him and Chellis July 6 of the same year. In this contest
Jacobs and Hill, who afterwards became interested in his
telephone claims, appeared as the counsel of Drawbaugh.
On the 2d of July, 1879,, Drawbaugh filed another application in the Patent Office for "improvement in water motors,"
Chellis to have in this also a two-thirds interest. Upon this
application a patent was issued March 16, 1880.
It is impossible to believe, if Drawbaugh had in his shop,

alone, that he would have set himself to work, in the first
instance, at developing his clock enterprise, or perfecting his
former .conception of a measuring faucet, ifistead of making
some effort to call the attention of his friends to his great discovery of the telephone, which he was in danger of losing by
the patent which had been issued to another, and which he
could not but have known was even then attracting the greatest attention. And in this connection it must be kept in mind
that the theory of the defence is, as stated in the answer, that
Drawbaugh had at that time fully perfected his invention, and
that while at first he "conceived that its range and capacity

Opinion of the Court.

for usefulness to the public might be very greatly enlarged,"
he had, before the date of Bell's patent, -" notwithstanding his
embarrassed and impoverished pecuniary condition, and his
utter want of proper mechanical tools," finally perfected
his work. His conduct afterwards, therefore, is to be judged,
not as that of one who was still in the midst of his experiments, and doubtful of the results, but of one who had arrived
at the end and had completed his success.
No man of his intelligence, with or without the enthusiasm upon the subject which it is said he possessed, could
have remained silent under such circumstances. As we have
read the testimony, it is not even pretended that he took any
of his instruments outside of his own village until May, 1878,
when, as is claimed, he showed one to his friend Stees, in Harrisburg, whom he had known for years, and who was the first
to use, and, in fact, was then using, a Bell telephone, in that
place, upon a private line of his own between his office and
his shops. This produced no results, and when afterwards, in
January, 1879, Chellis was told that Drawbaugh had "a
phonograph and a telephone that he had invented," he gave it
no attention, because, to use his own language, "I was interested in the faucet and motor business, and wished to push
them, and I did not think we could do much with the telephone, as Bell had a patent, and I.did not know that he could
antedate them." And again, when speaking of a conversation
he had with Drawbaugh, he said: "I advised him to drop it
-the telephone -as he could not antedate Bell. He said he
did not know about that; that he had been working on, it a
good while. It was his way of expressing himself; when I
would say, 'You can't antedate Bell,' he would say, 'I don't
know about that; I have been working at it a good while."'
This, it must be remembered, was in 1879, after the telephone
had become a success, and after it had been a year or more in
use in Harrisburg, where Chellis lived. It is impossible to
believe that either Chellis or Drawbaugh was ignorant of the
approximate time of Bell's invention, which had been the
subject of frequent -newspaper comment from the time of its
exhibition at the Centennial. The subject was often referred

TELEPHONE CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

to in the Harrisburg and Mechanicsburg papers, and it is not
for a moment to be supposed that all of these various articles
escaped their attention. Under such circumstances, if it were
true that Drawbaugh had made his "D" and "E," as is now
claimed, in February, 1875, he certainly would have said so,
and would not have contented himself with so doubting an
answer to Chellis's suggestion of his inability to antedate Bell
as that which Chellis -now says he gave.
Another important fact in this connection is one which is
proved by the testimony of Andrew R. Kiefer, who, from
1863, had been division telegraph operator, having charge of
the middle division of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and residing in Harrisburg. From 1867 to the winter of 1881-2 he
was a member of a partnership firm in that place which was
engaged in "the manufacture of burglar alarms, electric hotel
annunciators, and fine electric -work for the governmentinstruments for the Signal Bureau, patent models, &c." He had
also, since 1876, kept a place for the sale of electrical supplies.
He had known Drawbaugh certainly since 1876, and probably
before. Drawbaugh met him on different occasions and talked
upon electrical matters. In the course of their acquaintance.
Drawbaugh showed him an electrical fire-alarm apparatus and
the works of his electric clock, but the subject of telephones
was never alluded to between them until in the summer of
1881, when this occurred. We quote from Kiefer's deposition:
"In the summer of 1881 I took my wife out for a drive,
and went over to see his [Drawbaugli's] works, never having
seen them, and having promised to come and see him some
time; my wife, not caring about going through the'shop,
remained in the carriage, and I went through alone with Mr.
Drawbaugh. He showed me through the shops and introduced
me to Mr. Chellis, and showed me parts of the water motor and
some other things of his getting up. On account of my wife's
being in the carriage alone I did not stay long. As I stepped
into, or was just in the carriage, Mr. Drawbaugh said, 'I forgot
to show you my telephone.' I did not get out again to go and
see it, and I drove away without seeing it, expecting to see it
again, but I have never got over to the shop since."

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

This was after the suit of the Bell Company against the
People's Company was begun, and of course after the matter โข
got into the hands of Chellis and his associates. It is no
answer to the criticism of Drawbaugh's conduct in this particular to say, as was said in argument, that "one reason why
he did not speak or apply to every man with whom he had
personal acquaintance, was that he was ridiculed by his neighbors; that his invention was considered a humbug by them,
and of no commercial value." Bell's success was proclaimed
in the Harrisburg Patriot. as early as February 26, 1877, and
the days of ridicule were then past. If Drawbaugh had at
that time in his shop the machines which it is now claimed
were all complete as they now are by August, 1876, and, most
of thiem before, there cannot be a doubt that he would have
taken them to some place where they could be tried, and show
that they would do what he had all along claimed for them.
All he had to do, at any time after he came back from the
Centennial, was to take any pair of his little instruments to
his friend Zeigler or his friend Stees at Harrisburg, attach
them to a line wire, and show what he had. They were men
who could appreciate his achievement, and help him if it was,
as he now says it was, a success. It would certainly have
been easier then, within two years of the time the first of
them were made, and within, a year of the date of Bell's
patent, to show that he "antedated" Bell, than it was three
years afterwards, when hewas b~rught into the controversy
through the instrumentality of his associates, 'not, as must be
evident to all, to get a patent for himself, but to defeat that
of Bell. And in this connection it is specially significant that
the application which it is claimed was made for a patent on
the 21st of July, 1880, and the specification of his invention
which was then- written out, have been purposely and designedly kept out of the case, although their production was
demanded. They were written before this suit was begun,
and it is impossible to believe that they would have been withheld, at least upon the call of the opposite party, if they were
in all respects consistent with the subsequent developments of
the case. The excuse given by counsel at the time, that they

were "in the secret archives of the Patent Office," and "if
produced and published in this cause would possibly invite the
filing of contesting applications, and result in interference and
additional litigation, besides unnecessarily prolonging the taking of testimony here and increasing the expenses," we cannot
accept as.satisfactory, especially.as in the answer it was said
that one object of filing the application was to procure "interference proceedings to be instituted against the patents of
Bell, in order that Drawbaugh may be adjudged by the Commissioner to be, as he rightfully is, the original and first inventor."
We have not overlooked the depositions that have been taken
in such large numbers to show that Drawbaugh was successful
with "F ," "B," "C," cI," and "A," before "D" and " E
were made. They have been studied with care, and if they
contained all the testimony in the case it would be more difficult to reach'the conclusion that Drawbaugh's claim was not
sustained. But in our opinion their effect has been completely
overcome by the conduct of Drawbaugh, about which there is
no dispute, from the time of his visit to the Centennial until
he was put forward by the promoters of the People's Company, nearly four years afterwards, to contest the claims of
Bell. He was silent so far as the general public were concerned, when if he had really done what these witnesses now
think he did he would most certainly have spoken. There is,
hardly a single act of his connected with his present claim,
from the time he heard, before going to Philadelphia, that
some one else had invented a telephone which was on exhibi-"
tion at the Centennial, that is not entirely inconsistent with
the idea even then of a complete discovery or invention by
himself which could be put to any practical use. It is not
pretended that what he did was done in private. He bad
influential friends with ample pecuniary resources, ready to
help him in bringing out his inventions when they promised
success. He easily got aid for his clock and for his faucet.
The news of Bell's invention spread rapidly and at once, and
it took but a few months to demonstrate to the world that he
had achieved a brilliant success. If it were known at Eberly's

OCTOBER TERM, ih87.

Mills alone that Drawbaugh had been doing the same thing
for years in his shop there -and it certainly would have been
known all through the little village if it had actually been
done-no one can believe that the public would be kept in
ignorance of it until four years afterwards, when a "special"
from Washington "to the Cincinnati Commercial" announced
a "Telephone Combination" to have entire charge of the
telephones, not only in this country, but in the world," that
could transmit messages "for almost a song."
But there is another fact in this case equally striking. As
has already been seen, "F,"

," "C;"

and "I"

were in no

condition for use when they were produced and put in evidence. They were mere "remains," and no one but Drawbaugh himself could, tell how they were made or how they
were to be used. He undertook to reproduce some of them,
especially "F" and "B." This was in the latter part of 1881,
while the testimony was being taken. The Bell Company
proposed that they should be tried to see if they would do
what the witnesses said had been done with the originals,
which the "remains" show must have been exceedingly primitive in their character. The testimony also shows that when
they were originally used by or in the presence of the witnesses, no particular care was taken in their adjustment: They
were lying around in the shop or standing upon shelves. Some
say that when experiments were made they were held in the
hand or allowed to stand on the table. Many testify to satisfactory results, and Drawbaugh himself said in his deposition:
"I would have persons in the cellar reading printed mattersome advertisement or som-.thig-and I could hear the words
that were read; and at other times I would go down into the
cellar and read something, and coming ulJ they would repeat
the words to me that I had read."
The proposition of the Bell Company. was accepted, and the
reproductions were tried in March, 1882, under thp most favorable circumstances. Three days were occupied in !he test, and
it is substantially conceded that it was a failure. Occasionally
a sound was heard and sometimes a word, but "it would not
transmit sentences." At the time of these experiments " ,"

which was the transmitter, was placed on a table, and used as

Drawbaugh said it was originally.
other reproductions were presented, differently constructed
and used in a different way, and these would "talk," but they
were neither made nor used in the same way as the originals.
To our minds the result of the second experiments conclusively
showed that the original instruments could not have done
what the witnesses supposed they did, and that what they. saw
and heard was produced by some other means than an electric
speaking telephone. We do not doubt that Drawbaugh may
have conceived the idea that speech could be transmitted to a
distance by means of electricity and that he was experimenting
upon that subject, but to hold that he had discovered the art of
doing it before Bell did would be to construe testimony without
regard to "the ordinary laws that govern human conduct."
Atlantic Works v. Brady, 107 U. S. 192, 203. Without pursuing the subject further we decide that the Drawbaugh
defence has not been made out.
Another objection to Bell's patent, put forth in the oral
argument of Mir. Hill, and in the printed brief signed by him
Dixon, is, that his application as
by
and in that signed ]Mr.
originally filed in the Patent Office did not contain his present
fourth claim, or any description of the variable resistance
method, and that all which now appears in the specifica4.on
on that subject, including the fourth claim, was surreptitiously
interpolated afterwards.
Bell's application was filed February 14, 1876, and afterwards, during the saine day, Elisha Gray filed a caveat, in
which he claimed as his invention "the art of transmitting
vocal sounds or conversations telegraphically through an
electric circuit," and in his specification described the variable
resistance method. The precise charge now made in the
printed brief of Mr. Hill is, that "Mr. Bell's attorneys had an
underground railroad in operation between their office and
Examiner Wilbur's room in the Patent Office, by which they
were enabled to have unlawful and guilty knowledge of Gray's
papers as soon as they were filed in the Patent- Office," and
"that an important invention, and a claim therefor, were

OCTOBER TERM,

Opinion of the Court

bodily interpolated into Bell's specification, between February
14, 1876, and February 19, 1876, by Pollok, in consequence of
the guilty knowledge which the latter already had of the
contents of Gray's caveat before the declaration of interference with Gray on February 19th."
So grave a charge, made-in so formal a manner, is entitled
to careful consideration. It involves the professional integrity
and moral character of eminent attorneys, and requires us to
find from the evidence that after Bell swore to his application
on the 20th of January, 1876, and after the application thus
sworn to had been formally filed in the Patent Office, an
examiner, who got knowledge of the Gray caveat put in
afterwards, disclosed its contents to Bell's attorneys; that
they'were then allowed to withdraw the application, change
it so as to include Gray's variable resistance method over
Bell's signature, and over the jurnat, and then restore it to the
files, thus materially altered, as if it were the original; and
all this between February 1 and February 19.
Although much stress was laid in argument on the fact thatwhat purported to be a certified copy of the 9pecification of
Bell, as found in the file wrapper and contents printed in the
Dowd case, differed materially from the patent, the cause of
these differences has been explained in the most satisfactory
manner, and we entertain no doubt whatever that the specifi-ation as now found in the patent is precisely the same as
that on which the order to issue Was made. If any alterations
were made it was all done before February 19, and the fair
copy 'which is now found on the files of the Office is.precisely
-asit.
was when the order for the patent was granted. Not a
shadow of suspicion can rest .on any one growing out of the
misprint of the specification in the Dowd case.
All that remains, therefore, on which to rest this serious
charge is, that in a paper handed by Bell to George Brown,
of Toronto, describing his invention, and which was intended
England to secure a British patent, what is now
to be used ii,
claimed to be an interpolation in the American application is
not to be found. It is but right to say that during the whole
course of the protracted litigation upon the Bell patent, no

argument was ever presented based on this discrepancy until
the brief of Mr. Hill was filed in this court on the 18th of
January, 1887, six clays before the argument in these appeals
was begun. So far as we are advised nothing had ever before
occurred in the cases that seemed to make it necessary to
prove when the variable resistance method or the fourth claim
was put into the American application, or why it was left out
of the paper handed to Brown. It seems always to have been
assumed until the cases got here, that because it was in the
American patent it was rightfully there. Certainly there is
nothing in the pleadings in any of the cases to direct attention
to the materiality of this fact.
A comparison of the paper handed Brown with the American application shows that they differ in more than thirty
different places besides those which relate to the variable
resistance method and the fourth claim. The differences are
generally.iu forms of expression, thus indicating that one was
written after the other and evidently for the purpose of securing greater accuracy. The paper handed Brown was clearly
a rough draft and not a fair copy, for the record shows that
it bore on its face the evidence of many erasures and interlineations. Bell says in his testimony that he began writing his
specification in September or October, 1875, and wrote and
rewrote it a number of times, finally adopting that mode, of
expression which seemed to him the best to explain his invention and the relation which one portion bore to another. -He
visited Brown in Canada in Septeniber and again in December,
1875. The arrangement was made between them on the 29th
of December, at this last interview, by which BroWn was to
interest himself in getting out British patents. Other inventions besides the telephone were included in the contract
entered into for that purpose.'
Bell returned to Boston on the 1st of January, and immediately set himself to work to complete his specification. He
had it done so that it was taken to Washington by Mr. Hubbard about the 10th of that. month, and delivered to Pollok
and Bailey, the attorneys. It Wias then examined by the
attorneys, found correct, and a fair copy made and returned

on the 18th to Bell in Boston for his signature and oath. It
was signed and sworn to in Suffolk County, Massachusetts,
January 20, and immediately returned to the attorneys. Afterwards Pollok met Bell in New York, and it was again gone
over with care by the two together. No change whatever
was made in it at that time, and Pollok took it back with him
to Washington.
On the 25th of January, 1876, Bell met Brown, who was
then on the way to England, in New York. It is now assumed
that the paper which Brown took to England was handed to
him then, and because the variable resistance method and the
fourth claim were not in that, it is argued that they could not
have been in the American specification at that time. But no
one has said when the paper was actually handed to Brown.
Bell says he cannot tell, but that, it must have been after he
made his contract with Brown on the 29th of December. As
the American specification was signed and sworn to five days
before the interview .with Brown on the 25th of January, and
the paper of Brown differs from it in so many particulars besides that now in question, it would seem to be 3lear that the
paper was a copy of some former draft which Bell had made
- possibly one taken to Canada in December- and not of
that which was perfected afterwards. As the specification
which had been prepared and sworn to was a fair copy, without erasures or interlineations, the fact that the paper handed
Brown was not a fair copy would imply that it was not intended to be an exact transcript of the other. At any rate,
the bare fact that the difference exists under such circumstances
is not sufficient to brand Bell and his attorneys and the officers
of the Patent Office with that infamy which the charges made
against them imply. We therefore have no hesitation in rejecting the argument. The variable resistance method is introduced only as showing another mode of creating electrical
undulations. That Bell had had his mind upon the effect of
such a method is conclusively established by a letter which he
addressed to Mr. Hubbard on the 4th of May, 1875, and which
is found in the Dowd record, introduced into the Overland
case by stipulation. Its insertion in his final draft of his

specification is another proof of the care with which his work
had been done.
In the case of the Clay Commercial Comipany objection was
made to the sufficiency of the proof of the incorporation of the
American Bell Telephone Company and of its title to the Bell
patents. Upon the first point the proof was, 1, a special act of
the general court of Massachusetts, entitled "Af act to incorporate the American Bell Telephone Company," which authorized certain persons therein named and their associates to organize themselves under the provisions of c. 224 of the acts of 1870,
and the acts in amendment thereof,- for telephone purposes;
and, 2, a certificate of the Secretary of the Commonwealth in
the form required by ยง 11 of c. 221, that certain persons, among
whom were the most of those mentioned in -the special act,
were legally organized and established as an existing corporation under the name of the American Bell Telephone Company.
This section made such a certificate "coficlusive evidence of
the existence of a corporation" organized under that chapter.
The authority granted by the special a6t to the persons named
to organize as a corporatio, in this way, gave them the authority to select a corporate name, and also made the statutory
certificate conclusive evidence of their corporate existence.
The objections to the proof of title are not, in our opinion,.
well taken. We do not deem it necessary to add to the length
of this opinion by referring particularly to the testimony on
that point.
This disposes of all the cases. so far as the patent of March
7, 1876, is concerned. 'It remains only to consider the patent
of January 30, 1877, about which but little has been said
either in the oral or printed arguments. Apparently it received but little attention by counsel or the court in either of
the cases below. In the Dolbear case, it was by consent excluded from the detree, and of course is"
not presented by that
record in this court. In all the other cases the patent was
sustained, and the Clay Commercial Company was adjudged
to have infringed the third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth
claims; the Molecular Company the sixth, seventh, and eighth,
but not the fifth; the People's Company the fifth, sixth, and

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Opinion of the Court.

eighth; and the Overland Company the third, fifth, sixth,
seventh, and eighth. From the decree in favor of the iMolecular Company as to the fifth claim the Bell Company has
appealed.
In the case of the Clay Commercial Company it was alleged
in the answer that the substantial and material parts of the
things described and claimed were described and claimed in a
prior British patent taken out by or for Bell, dated December
9, 1876, and that, inasmuch as the American patent does not
bear the same date with the foreign patent, and is not limited
to expire therewith, it is void. - This point has not been pressed
in the argument here, and in our opinion it has been settled
by the decision of this court in O'Reilly v. Xorse, 15 How.
62, 112, and impliedly by that in Siemens v. Sellers, 123 U. S.
276, at the present term, that the effect of ยง 4887 of the Revised Statutes is not to render invalid an American patent
which does not bear the same date as a foreign patent for
the same invention, but only to limit its term.
The patent itself is for the mechanical structure of an electric telephone to be used. to produc- the electrical action on
which the first patent rests. The third claim is for the use in
such instruments of a diaphragm, made of a plate of iron or
steel, or other material capable of inductive action; the fifth
of a permanent magnet constructed as described with a coil
upon the end or ends nearest the plate; the sixth of a sounding
box as described; the seventh of a speaking or hearing tube
as described for conveying the sounds; and the eighth of a
permanent magnet and plate combined. The claim is not for
these several things in and of themselves, but for an electric
telephone in the. construction of which these things .or any of
them are used. Hence the fifth claim is not anticipated by
the Schellen magnet, as was decided in the Molecular case below.- The patent is not for the magnet, but for the telephone
of which it forms but part. To that e=tent the decree in that
case was erroneous.
It follows that the decree in each of the cases, so far as it
is in favor of the Bell Company and those claiming under it,
must be affirmed, and that the decree in the Molecular case,

so far as it is against that company on the fifth claim of the
patent of January 30, 187T, must be reversed and a decree
directed, to that extent in its favor. It is consequently so
ordered.
MR.

JUSTICE BRADLEY,

with whom concurred

JusTIcEs FIELD

and HARLAN, dissenting.
Mr. Justice Field, Mr. Justice Tarlan and myself are not
able to concur with the other members of the court, sitting in
these cases, in the result which has been reached by them.
Without expressing an opinion on other issues, the point on
which we dissent relates to the defence made on the alleged
invention of Daniel Drawbaugh, and applies to all the cases
in which that invention is set up. We think that Drawbaugh
anticipated the invention of Mr. Bell, who, at most, is not
claimed to have invented the speaking telephone prior to June
10th, 1875. We think that the evidence on this point is so
overwhelming, with regard both to the number and character
of the witnesses, that it cannot be overcome. As this is a
question of fact, depending upon the weight of the evidence,
and involves no question of law, it does not require an extended discussion on the part of those who dissent from the
opinion of the majority, -- which is very ably drawn, and
presents the case with great clearness and force. On the
point mentioned, however, we cannot concur in the views
expressed.
The essence of the invention claimed by Mr. Bell is, the
transmission of articulate speech to a distance, by means of
an electrical current subjected to undulations produced by the
air vibrations of the voice. There are two modes (as yet discovered) by which these undulations may be thus produced.
In one they are produced by interposing in the circuit a substance whose electrical conductivity may be varied by the
concussions, or vibrations of the air produced by the voice.
This ig called the variable resistance process, because the electrical current is subjected to the variable resistance (or conductivity) of the substance thus interposed. By the other

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.

mode, the undulations are produced by the inductive effect of
an armature (or small, flat piece of iron), attached to the membrane spoken against, and placed near to the poles of an electro-magnet situated in the circuit. In both cases, the undulations impart the vibrations which caused them to another diaphragm at a distance (called the receiver) by means of an
electro-magnet in the circuit, placed near to an armature
affixed to such diaphragm. These vibrations, thus reproduced.
are detected by the ear, and the spoken words are heard.
We are satisfied from a very great preponderance of evidence, that Drawbaugh produced, and exhibited in his shop,
as early as 1869, an electrical instrument by which he transmitted speech, so as to be distinctly heard and understood, by
means of a wire and the employment of variable resistance to,
the electrical current. This variable resistance was produced
by causing the electrical current to pass through pulverized
charcoal, carbon and other substances, acted upon by the

invention so far as the principle of variable resistance is concerned.
We are also satisfied that as early as 1871 he reproduced
articulate speech, at a distance, by means of a current of
electricity, subjected by electrical induction to undulations
corresponding to the vibrations of the voice in speaking, - a
process substantially the same as that which is claimed in 'Mr.
Bell's patent.
In regard to the instrument in which the principle of variable resistance was used, more than seventy witnesses were
examined, who either testified to having seen it and heard it, or
established such facts and circumstances in relation to it as to
put its existence and date beyond a question. With regard
to the instrument in which electrical induction was employed
to produce the requisite undulations, some forty or fifty witnesses were produced, many of whom saw it and heard speech
through it, and others either saw it, or heard it talked about
in such a manner as to fix the time when it was in existence.
On the questions of time and result, there is such a cloud of
witnesses in both cases, that it seems almost impossible not to

give credence to them. The evidence of some of them may have
been shaken with regard to the time they had in mind; but that
of the reat majority was not shaken at all, but corroborated by
circumstances which rendered the proo'f- irrefragable. Many of
them, it is true, were plain country people; but they heard
the words through the instrument; and that is a matter about
which they could not be mistaken. It did not require science
nor learning to understand that. But the witnesses were not
confined to this class. A number of them were people of
position in society, official, professional, and literary, - all,
however, like the inventor, regarding the matter more as one
of curiosity than of public importance..
As it would serve no useful purpose to repeat the testimony
of these witnesses, we shall refrain from doing so. We will
only add that nearly all the original instruments used by
Drawbaugh were produced on the trial, and identified by the
witnesses. Some of them were broken and in a dilapidated
condition, but sufficiently perfect to be accurately reproduced.
Their very form and principle of construction showed that,
they were intended for speaking telephones, and nothing else.
Drawbaugh certainly had the principle, and accomplished the
result. Perhaps without the aid of Mr. Bell, the speaking,
telephone would not have been brought into public use to this
day; but that Drawbaugh produced it, there can hardly be a
reasonable doubt.
We do not question Mr. Bell's merits. He appreciated the
importance of the invention, and brought it before the public

scientific, or public importance. This explains why he did not
take more pains to bring it forward to public notice. Another
cause of his delay in bringing his 'invention to publid notice
was, that he was ever indulging the hope of producing speech,
at the receiving end of the line, loud and distinct enough to
be heard across a room, like the voice of a person speaking in
an ordinary tone.
It is perfectly natural for the world to take the part of the
man who has already achieved eminence. No patriotic Briton
could believe that anybody but Watt could produce an improvement in the steam engine. This principle of human
nature may well explain the relative feeling towards Bell and
Drawbaugh in reference to the invention of the telephone.
It is regarded as incredible that so great a discovery should
have been made by the plain mechanic, and not by the eminent scientist and inventor. Yet the proof amounts to demonstration, from the testimony of Mr. Bell himself, and his
assistant, Watson, that he never transmitted an intelligible
word through an electrical instrument, nor produced any such
instrument that would transmit an intelligible word, until
after his patent had been issued; whilst, for years before,
Drawbaugh had talked through his, so that words and sentences had again and again been distinctly heard. We do not
wish to say a word depreciatory of Mr. Bell. He was original,
if not first. He preconceived the principle on which the result
must be obtained, by that forecast which is acquired from
scientific knowledge, as Leverrier did the place of the unknown planet; but in this as in the actual production of
the thing, he was, according to the great preponderance of
the evidence, anticipated by a man of far humbler pretensions.
A common astronomer, by carefully sweeping the sky, might
have been first in discovering the planet iNeptune; whilst no
.ane but a Leverrier, or an Adams, could have ascertained its
existence and position by calculation.
So it was with Bell
and Drawbaugh. The latter invented the telephone without
appreciating the importance and completeness of his invention. Bell subsequently projected it on the basis of scientific
inference, and took out a patent for it. But, as our laws do

PETITION FOR REHEARING.
On behalf of the People's Telephone Company and the
Overland Telephone Company, the following petition for rehearing was filed May 7, 1888 :
"To THE HIONORABLE JUSTICES OF SAID COURT:
"The appellants in the above-entitled cases hereby humW-h
pray that the court will rehear and reconsider the matters decided March 19, 1888, so far as the same involve the question
of priority of invention of the electric speaking telephone between Alexander Graham Bell and Daniel Drawbaugh; and
that an order or orders be entered reversing the decisions
below and dismissing the appellees' bills, with costs to the
appellants in said cases respectively.
"The grounds of this application are, first, that the court, in
its said decision, as evidenced by its written opinion, filed on
said 19th day of March, giving its reasons therefor, inadvertently erred in respect to certain matters of fact and of law
material to, and decisive of, said question, and therefore of
these cases; and, secondly, that in consequence of said errors,
the decision of the court was against the weight of the evidence.
"The opinion of the court treats three portions of the evidence as controlling, viz. : (1) The evidence of a great cloud of
witnesses as to what Drawbaugh, prior to the fall of 1876, had
accomplished in the matter of an electric speaking telephone;
(2) His conduct from that time to the year 1880, when the
appellants became interested in his inventions; (3) The New
York and Philadelphia tests.

I. Proofs of Drawbaug'sPriority.
"Mr. Storrow, complainant's counsel, admitted in his oral
argument that 'forty-nine witnesses testified that they had
heard speech in Drawbaugh's shop before the date of the Bell
patent' (Oral Argument of Storrow, p. 149).
"Seventy witnesses heard talk through the Drawbaugh
telephones, or were present when others successfully talked
through them prjior to Bell's alleged conception of the telephone June 2, 1875.
"One hundred and forty-nine witnesses actually saw the
instruments, and two hundred and twenty testified to having
heard of or seen them prior to that time.
"Mfany of the witnesses testified to such circumstances,
facts, and records corroborative of their evidence as to make
it impossible that they could have erred, and either their testimony is true or they committed wilful perjury. No attempt
has been made to impeach them. The dates they positively
aver are all prior to June, 1875, the year when Bell claimed to,
have first conceived the idea of the telephone. Of this class
of witnesses are the following:
"WHIson, H. Strickler: Never was at Milltown but once.
Had made an invention for insulating teleg:aph wires. Visited Drawbaugh for information and advice concerning that
invention. Had not then filed his application for a patent.
He and Drawbaugh talked to each other through the telephone at that time, and Drawbaugh explained to him how
electricity operated it. Subsequently filed his application and
obtained a patent for his invention. Produced the specifications -and drawings as filed, and the patent as issued. Date of
filing, August 22, 1874 ; date of patent, April 20, 1875 (Additional Proofs, p. 233).
" George iv.Bowman: Resides at Mechanicsburg. Drove
to Eberly's Mills with his wife to attend a baptism. After the
baptism drove to Drawbaugh's shop. This was during the
lifetime of his wife's mother, who died in 1871. He then and
there heard Drawbaugh talk through the telephone (Additional Proofs, p. 173).

"Emanuel Z Gregory: Resided at Milltown from March to
October, 1870. Then removed to Massachusetts. Has never
been in Pennsylvania since until he testified. At Milltown
worked at Drawbaugh's shop for faucet company. The company's books corroborate this. Assisted Drawbaugh in his
experiments, and heard him talk through his telephone a number of times. Identifies B and F as the instrulents (Additional Proofs, p. 185).
"William I. Zearing: Had a pair of steelyards relettered
by Daniel Drawbaugh. Entered the date and charge therefor
in a book, November 23, 1873, as shown by book produced.
Never had any steelyards relettered at any other time. When
he went for them Drawbaugh talked to him through a telephone, saying among other things, "The steelyards are finished." Zeering was the secretary of the school board of his
township (Def. Sur. Reb. Testimony, p. 122).
"Other witnesses of the same class are: Goodyear (Def. Sur.

"Of the above proofs the court say" 'If they contained all
the testimony in the case it would be more difficult to reach
the conclusion that Drawbaugh's -claim was not sustained.
But in our opinion their effect has been completely overcome
by the conduct of Drawbaugh, about which there is no dispute, from the time of his visit to the Centennial until he was
put forward by the promoters of the People's Company,
nearly four years afterwards, to contest the claims of Bell'
p. 565.

OCTOBER TERM, 1887.
Petition for Rehearing.

"This conduct, concerning which the court say tL 3re is no
dispute, relates solely to his incapacity as a business man. It
is true that there is no dispute as to his incapacity to use, to
the best advantage, the opportunity his invention gave him;
but the court has evidently overlooked much testimony to
show the constant efforts he did make to secure capital from
1816 to 1880 to enter upon the contention which would be
sure to follow an application for a patent. Among the witnesses on this point are: Moffitt (Def. Record, Vol. 1, p. 497);
Ohellis (Same, p. 526), and Shettel (Same, p. 214). The accompanying brief cites many other witnesses to Drawbaugh's
constant auld earnest, seeking of assistance to push his telephone inventions.
"IlL Drawbaugh'sIgnorance of the Date of Bell's Invention.
" Drawbaugh swore that he did not know the alleged date
of Bell's invention until 1880 (Def. Record, Vol. 2, p. 870).
The court must have overlooked this testimony, for they say
that he must have known of the approximate time of Bell's
invention, because the subject of the invention itself was often
referred to in the Harrisburgh and Mechanicsburgh papers.
He did not know but Bell had been at work on it as he himself had been for many years. The date of the patent was
no guide to the date of the invention.
"IV. _Drawbaugh's Visit to the Centennial.
"The failure of Drawbaugh to ascertain, when visiting the
Centennial Exhibition, whetha the telephone instruments
there exhibited by Bell were similar to his own, seems to have
been regarded by the court as strong evidence against his
claim. But the court, after citing questions and answers from
386 to 398, inclusive, overlook the answer to the very next
question, in which Drawbaugh testifies that none of the instruments he saw at Philadelphia were the instruments represented in the cuts of Bell's instruments as given in the record
in this case.
"The testimony of Prof. Barker (Add. Proofs, p. 7) says
that the Bell instruments were not easily accessible in the

TELEPHONE CASES.
Petition for Rehearing.

building at that time. They seem to have been merely exhibited to invited individuals at times of private tests. A fair
inference from Drawbaugh's answers cited in the opinion of
the court, and the one omitted is that he saw the instruments
he supposed to be the subject of comment, and they were not
telephones at all, but were harmonic telegraphic instruments,
which his answers fairly describe.
"'V. Dralwbaugl's Pursuitof his Invention.
"The court say that he had apparently lost all interest in
talking machines from 1816 to 1880. Such a conclusion could
only be reached by overlooking the evidence of many witnesses. Among these are Stees and Johnson, who operated
his carbon transmitter J at Harrisburg in -ay, 1878, months
before the Blake transmitter was invented (Add. Proofs, pp.
209 and 198). He was constantly exhibiting his telephones
during the whole of those four years to numerous witnesses,
as will readily be seen by citations in the accompanying brief,
but what is absolutely conclusive on this point is the fact that
he made the most effective and finished telephones from 1876
to 1880.
"VI. JDrawbaugh'sl.Veglect to Apply for a Patent.
"The cost of an application for a patent being small, the
failure of Drawbaugh to make such application is taken by
the court as evidence that he had no invention. But this view
leaves out of consideration the certainty of interference proceedings, the cost of which he was advised would be enormous,
which advice has since been abundantly justified.
"VII.

zYroA and Philadelphia.
The Tests at 3tew

"Successful tests of Drawbaugh's instruments, both original
and reproduced, were made in New York in1882 and in Philadelphia in 1885.
"The court say that: ' It is substantially conceded that the
test in New York was a failure'; that 'Occasionally sound
was heard, and sometimes a word, but it would not transmit
sentences.' That this was a very material error is shown by

OCTOBER TERMI, 1887.
Petition for Rehearing.

the testhnony of Mr. Benjamin, at page 1278 of Def. Vol. 2,
and by other witnesses. So far from it being conceded that
the test at New York was a failure, it was conceded by complainants' counsel, Mr. Storrow, that it was a success. Concerning the single instrument F, he said: 'There were one
hundred and thirty-seven phrases uttered into it on the second
day, seven of those were understood, and some words of seven
more, and that is all. The third day they got better. They
uttered one hundred and seventy-five phrases into the transmitter; thirty-five of those were heard.' (Oral argument in
Circuit Court, p. 92, filed here.)
"The court was of the opinion that the instruments afterwards reproduced and tested at Philadelphia were 'not the
a
samei
' but , differently constructed' ; but the Bell Company's
expert, Pope, swore that they differed only in being constructed
more carefully, and with better workmanship (Complainant's
Reply, p. 176).
"In the opinion of the court in this very case, it is said of
Bell's original instrument: ' The particular instrument which
he had, and which he used in his experiments did not under
the circumstances in which it was tried reproduce the words
spoken so that they could be clearly understood, but the proof
is abundant and of the most convincing character that other
instruments carefully constructed and made exactly in accordance with the specifications, without any additions whatever,
have operated and will operate successfully."'
"The court said the instruments were used in a different
way at Philadelphia than at New York ; that is to say, that
at New York they rested on a table, while at Philadelphia
they were held in the hand. But Prof. Barker testified that he
used them both ways at Philadelphia, and that they worked
best when standing on the table as they did at New York.
(Barker, Ans. 81 and 8- Def. Add. Proofs, p. 28). This evidence is more fully treated in the accompanying brief.
"VIII. The Constr'uction of the Instr-uments.
"The court said that nobody knew the actual construction
of the original machines except Drawbaugh himself. But

TELEPHONE CASES.
Petition for Rehearing.

there is much evidence beside that of Drawbaugh as to their
construction, as will be seen by reference to the testimony
cited in the accompanying brief, for example, H. K. Drawbaugh could reproduce the machines from memory. (Def.,
Vol. 1, pp. 566-7, Ans. 129, 130). Steinberger described one
from memory. (Def., Vol. 1, pp. 344-6), and so did Schrader
(Def. Sur. iReb., pp. 470-1, and see ten others cited in brief).
"Finally.
"The court says, in its opinion: 'We do not doubt that
Drawbaugh may have conceived the idea that speech could be
transmitted to a distance by means of electricity, and that he
was experimenting upon that subject,' meaning, as is clear
from the context, that he did this before Bell's invention.
"The D.rawbaughstory, then, is no aftert/ought growing out
of Bell's discoveries, but is based upon the admitted facts of a
prior conception of the possibility of electric speech-transmission and prior experiments actually made to accomplish it.
The same witnesses who satisfy the judgment of the court as to
these facts, identify the machines and testify to their successful working, and are neither impeached nor contradicted as to
these additional facts. At another point, referring to Drawbaugh, the court says: ' He was a skilful and ingenious mechanic.

.

He was also somewhat of an inventor, and

had some knowledge of electricity. According to the testimony
he was an enthusiast on the subject of his 'talking-machine,'
and showed it freely to his neighbors and people from the
country when they visited his shop.' p. 557 supra.
"Taking these admitted facts together, his prior conception
of the possibility of electric speech transmission; his experiments to accomplish it; and, during his experiments his
enthusiasm about the talking-machine-how can his ent/usia~n be accounted for? Is it conceivable that enthusiasm resulted from constant failure? Can it be explained on any
other reasonable theory than that his machines were producing the successful results about which the corroborating witnesses so abundantly testify? And why should he exhibit the
invention so freely to the surrounding public, if it constantly

failed to work when thus exhibited? Did he exhibit it as a
failure or as a success? Can his conduct at the time, especially
when taken in connection with his contemporary declarations
that he had achieved the result, and was going to patent the
invention, and wanted financial aid to secure the patents, be
reconciled with any other theory than that of success? And
is it not clear that the court has erred as to the evidential
force of the facts which it admits to have been established?
"On account of the errors above referred to, which will be
made more apparent by reference to the accompanying brief,
and to the end, therefore, that equity may be done, and that
this court may, upon fuller consideration and with the advantage of oral argument, revise its former opinion (if revision be
right and proper), your petitioners pray that the court may
be pleased to take their suggestions under a careful consideration and grant a rehearing upon the points upon which said
decision was based, and grant such other relief and order as in
equity and good conscience may be proper.
