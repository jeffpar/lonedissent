On the other hand, in Hannibal &c. Railroad Company
v. Packet Company, 125 U. S. 260, 271, we said, citing several
authorities:
"But if there be any doubt as to the proper construction of
this statute, . . . then that construction must be adopted
which is most advantageous to the interests of the government. The statute being a grant of a privilege, must be construed most strongly in favor of the grantor."
For these reasons we think the judgment of the Court of
Claims was correct, and it is
Afflrmed.

v.

APPEAL FROBE THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 263. Argued April 24, 27, 1903.-Decided May 18,1903.

Under the statutes of Kentucky service of a summons upon the insurance
commissioner in an action against an insurance company doing business
in the State is sufficient to bring the company into court. This applies
to a company whose license has been cancelled by the commissioner but
which after such cancellation has continued to collect premiums and assessments on policies remaining in force. A judgment based upon such
service is, in the absence of anything else to impeach it, valid.
A proceeding, based upon a judgment so obtained, for the appointment of
a receiver, is not a new and independent suit, but a mere continuation of
the action already passed into judgment, and in aid of the execution
thereof, and can be initiated by the filing of an amended or supplementary petition. When such an amended petition is filed the action cannot
be removed to the Federal courts, as the time prescribed therefor by the
statute has already passed. Nor has the Federal court jurisdiction in
an equity action to enjoin proceedings under the supplementary petition,
as it is a mere continuation of an action at law. Where a proceeding
is not warranted by the law of a State, relief must be sought by review
in the appellate court of the State and not by collateral attack in the
Federal courts,

Statement of the Case.

190 U. S.

SEcTioN 631, Kentucky statutes, 1899, (Laws 1893, chap. I'll,
sec. 9-4,) reads as follows:
"SEC. 631. Before authority is granted to any foreign insurance company to do business in this State, it must file with the
commissioner a resolution adopted by its board of directors,
consenting that service of process upon any agent of such company in this State, or upon the commissioner of insurance of
this State, in any action brought or pending in this State, shall
be a valid service upon said company ; and if process is served
upon the commissioner it shall be his duty to at once send it by
mail, addressed to the company at its principal office; and if
any company shall, without the consent of the other party to
any suit or proceeding brought by or against it in any court of
this State, remove said suit or proceeding to any Federal court,
or shall institute any suit or proceeding against any citizen of
this State in any Federal court, it shall be the duty of the commissioner to forthwith revoke all authority to such company
and its agents to do business in this State, and to publish such
revocation in some newspaper of general circulation published
in the State."
On May 10, 1893, the appellant, The Mutual Reserve Fund
Life Association, hereinafter called the association, acting under said section, by resolution of its board of directors, consented
that the insurance commissioner of Kentucky should be authorized to receive service of process in any action brought or
pending in Kentucky, and also that like valid service of process
might be made upon every agent then or thereafter acting for
it in Kentucky.
On October 10, 1899, the insurance commissioner cancelled
the license which had theretofore been issued to the association,
and gave it notice that from and after that date all authority
granted by his department to it, and all licenses issued to its
agents to do business in the State of Kentucky, were revoked.
And from and after that date the association had no agent or
agents in the State of Kentucky and did no new business whatever in the State, but at one time, for the convenience of the
holders of certificates residing in Jefferson County, permitted
them to remit dues and assessments through the Western Bank,
located in the city of Louisville.

MUTUAL RESERVE &c. ASSN. v. PHELPS.
190 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

On February 28, 1900, James S. Phelps commenced an action in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Kentucky, against
the association, alleging that on July 8, 1885, he had made application for membership, and that on July 16, 1885, his application had been approved and a certificate of insurance issued
to him. Breaches of the agreement on the part of the defendA
ant were alleged, and a judgment asked for $1994.20.
summons was issued and served on the insurance commissioner,
and an alias summons was also issued and served upon Ben
Frese, as the managing agent and chief officer and agent of
the association in Jefferson County. The defendant appeared
specially and moved to quash the service on each summons.
The motion was heard on affidavits and overruled. The defendant taking no further action, judgment was rendered on
May 19, 1900, in favor of the plaintiff for $1994 with interest.
On August 4, 1900, the plaintiff filed an amended and supplemental petition, in which he alleged the filing of the original
petition, the judgment, the issue of execution, a return of ullaz
bona; that the defendant had a large number of policy holders in the State who at stated times and regular intervals became indebted to it for premiums and assessments upon its
policies of insurance, and prayed for a general attachment, or
in lieu thereof the appointment of a receiver to take charge of
the business and property of the defendant in Kentucky, and
that all revenues and income accruing to it from policy holders
and other debtors be ordered paid to the receiver. Upon the
filing of this amended and supplemental petition the court appointed the Fidelity Trust and Safety Vault Company, the
other appellee, hereinafter called the company, a receiver of
all the property of the defendant in Kentucky, directed it to
receive and collect all moneys and debts then owing or thereafter to accrue to the said defendant, and ordered all debtors
of the defendant to pay to such receiver all premiums and assessments which might become due or owing to it; such receivership to continue until the judgment of the plaintiff and
all costs and expenses had been paid, and then to terminate.
The company qualified as such receiver and gave notice to the
policy holders of the defendant.

OCTOBER TERM, 1902.
Argument for Appellant.

190 U. S.

On August 22, 1900, the association applied by petition and
bond for a removal of the case to the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Kentucky, which application
was denied. It does not appear that any copy of the record
was filed in the Federal court. But it commenced this suit in
that court against Phelps (the judgment creditor) and the company, to enjoin them from further proceeding under the order
made by the state court. The court issued an injunction, as
prayed for. 103 Fed. Rep. 515. On February 2, 1901, the
defendants moved to dissolve the injunction, which motion was
overruled and an appeal taken to the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. By that court the
decision of the Circuit Court was reversed February 4, 1902,
50 C. C. A. 339; 112 Fed. Rep. 453, and the case remanded,
with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint. From such
decree the association appealed to this court.
_Y. William, D. Guthrie and .Yl'r. Edmund F. Trabue, with
whom Hel. George Burunam, Jr., and Xb. Sewell T. Tyng were
on the brief for appellant.
The allegations of the bill, which, under defendant's motion
must be taken as true, show that the relief sought by way of
injunction is to restrain the enforcement of a void judgment
entered in a court without jurisdiction of the defendant who is
the complainant in this action. The judgment on its face is
valid, and under the pretended authority thereof the defendants
in this action are taking steps which will produce great and
irreparable damages to cornplainant.
I. The appeal is authorized by § 6 of the act of March 3,
1891, because the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court rests not
only on diverse citizenship but also on a controversy arising under the Fourteenth Amendment. Loeb v. Columbia Township
Trustees, 179 U. S. 472; American Sugar Refining Co. v. Vew
Orleans, 181 IT. S. 277; Huguley -Mfg. Co. v. Galeton. Mills,
184 U. S.290.
I. While § 720, Rev. Stat., prohibits an injunction to stay
proceedings in any court of a State, it does not prohibit an in-

Argument for Appellant.

junction against parties who are attempting acts of trespass
under color of a void order or judgment. If the order be void
upon its face, ordinarily a defence thereto is ample at law;
but if valid upon its face, as in this case, equity will relieve.
York v. Texas, 137 U. S. 15 ; Pennoyer v. eff, 95 U. S. 714;
_Northerm Pacific By. Co. v. .Kurtzman,82 Fed. Rep. 241, and
cases cited on p. 243 ; Terre Haute etc. By. Co. v. Peoriaetc.
Py. Co., 82 Fed. Rep. 943. The difference between staying
proceedings in a court and restraining trespass under a void judgment or order of a court acting without jurisdiction is fundamental. Fitts v. IkGhee, 172 U. S. 516, 529; Osborn v. Bank,
9 Wheat. 738; Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466; Balt. & 0. B.
Co., v. W~abash 1B. Co., 119 Fed. Rep. 678. In fraud cases it has
always been argued that relief by injunction could not be
granted owing to § 720, but this court has uniformly supported
the jurisdiction. -Marshallv. Holmes, 141 U. S. 589, 599 ; other
analogous cases are French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 238, 248; Robb v.
Vos, 155 U. S. 13, and see cases cited p. 38; Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 163 U. S. 494; Wagner v. Drake, 31 Fed. Rep. 849;
National Surety Co. v. State Bank, 120 Fed. Rep. 593. Section
720 is limited by the due process of law provision of the Fourteenth Amendment. Decisions holding that replevin or injunction will not lie against an officer in possession of property of a
stranger to the proceeding, at the suit of such stranger, are entirely consistent with the proposition that the property owner
may maintain a suit to protect it against one assuming to act
under void process. Kerm v. Huidekoer, 103 U. S. 485, in
which Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 583; .Freeman v. HZowe, 24
How. 450; Buck v. Colbath, 3 Wall. 334, are distinguished;
Gumbel v. Pitkin, 124 U. S. 131, 146. See also Julian v. Central Trust Co., 115 Fed. Rep. 956; Shields v. Coleman, 157 U. S.
168, 182; Central Nat. Bk. v. Stevens, 169 U. S. 432; Simposon
v. Ward, 80 Fed. Rep. 561.
The proposition that to determine the invalidity of, and give
relief against, a state court order alleged to be void for want of
jurisdiction it would be necessary to exercise appellate or revisory jurisdiction over that court has been answered by this
court. Johnson v. Waters, 111 U. S. 640, 667; JMarshall v.

Argument for Appellant.

190 U. S.

Holmes, 141 U. S. 589, 599 ; Arrowsmith v. Gleason, 129 U. S.
86, 98. Under § 285, Civil Code of Kentucky, the state courts
are prohibited from enjoining the execution of a judgment of
another court of the State even though void, Jacobsen v. Wernert, 19 Ky. L. R. 662; and in a case like this no relief can be
had except in the Federal courts, which are not bound by such
a statute. Barrow v. Hunton, 99 U. S. 80.
III. Although in every case of special appearance to contest jurisdiction an issue is raised as to facts warranting jurisdiction, the defendant does not waive any right by the
special appearance. Harkness v. Hyde, 98 U. S. 476; .- ex.
Cent. Ry. v. Pinkney, 149 U. S. 194, 209; Goldey v. -Morning
fNews, 156 U. S. 518, 526. There is no rule in Kentucky that
such an appearance constitutes a general appearance, as was
the case in York v. Texas, 137 U. S. 15, and Zaufman v.
lJrootters, 138 U. S. 285, but the rule is as above stated; but an
appeal cannot be taken without entering a general appearance.
Sun XAfut. Ins. Co. v. Crist, 19 Ky. L. R. 305; Nfewport 2ews

HUeath, 87 Kentucky, 651, 659; .Maude v. Rodes, 4 Dana, 147.
The ruling of a state court in determining its own jurisdiction
is not conclusive in a direct proceeding to set aside a judgment
or to enjoin its enforcement. Rose v. iimely, 4 Cranch, 241,
268; Elliott v. Peirsol, 1 Pet. 328, 340; Harrisv. Jlardeman,
14 How. 334, 341; Staorbucek v. furray, 5 Wend. 148, 158;
Tompson. v. WVallace, 18 Wall. 457, 468; and see also Cooper
v. Newell, 1M3 U. S. 555, and cases cited p. 565; and cases,
sup)ra. In cases of removal to the Federal courts the decision
of the state court in favor of its own jurisdiction is regarded
as a usurpation. Gordon v. -Longest,16 Pet. 97, 104 ; Insurance
Co. v. Dunn, 19 Wall. 214, 224; Removal Cases, 100 U. S.
457, 475; Railroad Co. v. XAississippi, 102 U. S. 135.
The authority of the insurance commissioner of the State to
represent the association did not continue after its exclusion
from the State. Home Ben. Soc. v. .iuehl, 59 S. W. Rep. 520,
distinguished, and see Forrest v. Pittsburgh.Bridge Go., 116
Fed. Rep. 357. A state court cannot, under pretence of construing a statute, affect the right or duty of the Federal court

acquires jurisdiction is a Federal question. Pennoyer v. Nef,

R. JUSTICE BREWER,

after making the foregoing statement,

delivered the opinion of the court.
Many questions were elaborately discussed by counsel both
orally and in brief, but we are of the opinion that the decisions
of two or three will dispose of the case. First, the service of
summons on the insurance commissioner was sufficient to bring

Opinion of the Court.

the association into the state court as party defendant. It was
stipulated between the parties that the outstanding policies
existing between the association and citizens of Kentucky were
continued in force after the action of the insurance commissioner
on October 10, 1899, and that on said policies the association
had collected and was collecting dues, premiums and assessments. It was, therefore, doing business within the State.
XfutuaZ Life Insurance Compan2y v. Spratley, 172 U. S.602.
The plaintiff was a citizen of Kentucky, and the cause of action
arose out of transactions had between the plaintiff and defendant while the latter was carrying on business in the State of
Kentucky under license from the State. Under those circumstances the authority of the insurance commissioner to receive
summons in behalf of the association was sufficient. Such was
the ruling of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky. -Home Beneft
Society of _Vew York v. .afueld, 22 Ky. Law IRep. 1378; 59
S. W. iRep. 520. In that case the society while doing business
in the State issued the policy sued on, but in April, 1894, before
the action was brought, ceased to do business and withdrew all
of its agents. Service on the commissioner was held good. The
court, in its opinion, after referring to a statute of 1870 and
the change made by section 631, under which this service was
made, said (p. 1379):
"It is sufficient to say that the agency created by the act of
1893 is, in its terms, broader than that created by the act of
1870. The words of the later statute express no limitation.
Whatever limitation shall be applied to it must be by implication. And when we consider the purpose of the act it becomes
clear that it would be frustrated by the construction contended
for. There is no need of the right to serve process upon the
insurance commissioner so long as the company has agents in
the State, and we think the purpose of the section was to provide a means of obtaining service of process upon foreign companies which no longer had agents in the State upon whom
process might be served in suits upon contracts made in this
State, whatever may be held as to suits upon contracts entered
into elsewhere." See also Germania Ins. Co. v. Ashby, 23 Ky.
Law Rep. 1564.

OCTOBER TERM, 1902.
Opinion of the Court.

190 U. S.

Such decision of the highest court of Kentucky, construing
one of its own statutes, if not controlling upon this court, is
very persuasive, and it certainly is controlling unless it be held
to be merely an interpretation of a contract created by the
statute. As an original question, and independently of any
expression on the part of the Court of Appeals, we are of the
opinion that such is the true construction. This and other
kindred statutes enacted in various States indicate the purpose
of the State that foreign corporations engaging in business
within its limits shall submit the controversies growing out of
that business to its courts, and not compel a citizen having
such a controversy to seek for the purpose of enforcing his
claims the State in which the corporation has its home. Many
of those statutes simply provided that the foreign corporation
should name some person or persons upon whom service of
process could be made. The insufficiency of such provision is
evident, for the death or removal of the agent from the State
leaves the corporation without any person upon whom process
can be served. In order to remedy this defect some States,
Kentucky among the number, have passed statutes, like the
one before us, providing that the corporation shall consent that
service may be made upon a permanent official of the State, so
that the death, removal or change of officer will not put the
corporation beyond the reach of the process of the courts. It
would obviously thwart this purpose if this association, having
made, as the testimony shows it had made, a multitude of contracts with citizens of Kentucky, should be enabled, by simply
withdrawing the authority it had given to the insurance commissioner, to compel all these parties to seek the courts of New
York for the enforcement of their claims. It is true in this
case the association did not voluntarily withdraw from the
State, but was in effect by the State prevented from engaging
in any new business. Why this was done is not shown. It
must be presumed to have been for some good and sufficient
reason, and it would be a harsh construction of the statute
that, because the State had been constrained to compel the association to desist from engaging in any further business, it
also deprived its citizens who had dealt with the association of

the right to obtain relief in its courts. We conclude, therefore, that the service of summons on the insurance commissioner was sufficient to bring the association into the state
court, and there being nothing else to impeach the judgment
it must be considered as valid.
Again, the proceeding for the appointment of a receiver was
not a new and independent suit. It was not in the strictest
sense of the term a creditor's bill. It did not purport to be for
the benefit of all creditors, but simply a proceeding to enable
the plaintiff in the judgment to obtain satisfaction thereof,
satisfaction by execution at law having been shown to be impossible by the return of nulla bona. It is what is known as a
supplementary proceeding, one known to the jurisprudence of
many States, and one whose validity in those States has been
recognized by this court. TFilliamsv. Hill, 19 How. 246; Atlantic & .Pacifc Railroad Company v. Hopkins, 94 U. S. 11;
Ex parte Boyd, 105 U. S. 647 ; Street Railroad Company v.
HYart, 114 U. S. 654. It is recognized in some cases in Kentucky. Caldwell v. Bank of Eminence, 18 Ky. Law Rep. 156;
Caldwell v. Deposit Bank, 22 Ky. Law Rep. 684. This proceeding was treated by the state court as one merely supplemental in its character. It was initiated by the filing of an
amended and supplementary petition. It was a mere continuation of the action already passed into judgment, and in aid
of the execution of such judgment. As such it was not subject to removal to the Federal court, the time therefor prescribed by the statute having passed. 24 Stat. 554; Martin
v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, 151 U. S. 673-684. Being a
mere continuation of the action at law, and not removable to
the Federal court, the latter had no jurisdiction to enjoin the
proceedings under it. It is contended that such a supplementary proceeding is not warranted by the laws of Kentucky;
that there is no statute of that State justifying it. But it has
been sanctioned by the judgment of the court in which the
proceeding was had, and cannot be treated by the Federal
courts as unauthorized. Laing v. Rigney, 160 U. S. 531. See
also .eadville Coal Co. v. -Mc Creery, 141 U. S. 475, 478. If not
warranted by the law of the State relief must be sought by re-

view in the appellate court of the State, and not by collateral
attack in the Federal court.
For these reasons we think the decision of the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit was right, and it is

ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY
v. PHILADELPHIA.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE

EASTERN DISTRICT OF rENNSYLVANIA.
No. 163. Argued February 24, 1903.-Decided June 1, 1903.

The following propositions as to the taxation by States and their municipalities of corporations engaged in carrying on interstate commerce have
been settled:
1. The Constitution of the United States having given to Congress the
power to regulate commerce, not only with foreign nations, but
among the several States, that power is necessarily exclusive whenever the subjects are national in their character, or admit only of
one uniform system or plan of regulation. Bobbins V. Shelby Taxing District,120 U. S. 489, 492.
2. No State can compel a party, individual or corporation, to pay for the
privilege of engaging in interstate commerce.
3. This immunity does not prevent a State from imposing ordinary property taxes upon property having a situs within its territory and employed in interstate commerce.
4. The franchise of a corporation, although that franchise is the business
of interstate commerce, is, as a part of its property, subject to
state taxation, providing at least the franchise is not derived from
the United States.
5. No corporation, even though engaged in interstate commerce, can appropriate to its own use property public or private, without liability to a charge therefor.
Where telegraph companies, engaged in interstate commerce, carry on their
business so as to justify police supervision, the municipality is not obliged
to furnish such supervision for nothing, but it may, in addition to ordinary property taxation, subject the corporations to reasonable charges
for the expense thereof.
