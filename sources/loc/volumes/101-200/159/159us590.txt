OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

The decree of the court below was clearly correct and is,
therefore,
Afirmed.

CLUNE v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT O
No. 517.

UNITED STATES FOR THE

CALIFORNIA.

Argued October 80, 1895. - Decided November 18, 1895.

It is doubtful whether the record and bill of exceptions present for review
the matters complained of in the brief of counsel.
On the trial of parties charged with the criminal offence of conspiring to
stop the mails, contemporary telegrams from different parts of the
country, announcing the' stoppage of mail trains, are admissible in evidence against the defendants if identified and brought home to them.
So, too, the acts and declarations of persons not parties to the record are in
such case admissible against the defendants if it appears that they were
made in carrying the conspiracy into effect, or attempting to carry it
into effect.
Instructions of the court below, to become part of the record, must be incorporated in a bill of exceptions, and be authenticated by the signature
of the trial judge.
It is within the power of Congress to provide, for persons convicted of
conspiracy to do a criminal act, a punishment more severe than that
Drovided for persons committing. such act.
THE

delivered the opinion of the court.

On July 3, 1894, the plaintiffs in error, together-with one
A. T. Johnson, were indicted under section 5440, Rev. Stat.,
in the District Court for the Southern District of California,
for a conspiracy to obstruct the passage of the United States

CLUNE v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

mails. On November 17 a jury was empanelled and a trial
begun, which resulted, on November 21, in .a verdict of guilty.

Motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment having
been overruled, the defendants were, on December 6, each
sentenced to pay a fine of one dollar and to be imprisoned in
the county jail of Los Angeles County for the period of eighteen months. The defendant Johnson, at the time of sentence,. withdrew his motions for a new trial and in arrest of
judgment. The other defendants, the present plaintiffs in
error, have brought the case to this court.
It is doubtful whether the record is in such condition as to
present for review the matters complained of in the brief or
argument of counsel. There is only one bill of exceptions,
which was signed and filed on December 24, and is authenticated in these words: " The defendants claiming that they
are entitled to a bill of exceptions to review the ruling upon
their motion for a new trial and having presented the foregoing as such bill, the same is hereby allowed and settled as a
correct statement of the proceedings had on the trial so far as
it goes." It preserves no portion of the charge, does not purport to contain all the evidence, but does state that on the
trial certain testimony was offered and admitted over the
objections of defendants, and exceptions taken. If this bill
of exceptions was prepared simply for the purposes of a review
of the ruling on the motion for a new trial, as seems to be
suggested by the words of the authentication, then we are
confronted with the proposition so often announced that the
action of the court in overruling a motion for a new trial is
not assignable as error. Moore v. United States, 150 U. S.
57; Holder v. United States., 150 U. S. 91; Blitz v. United
States, 153 U. S. 308; Wheeler v. United States, 159 U. S. 523.
If' no error can be affirmed in overruling a motion, it would
seem unnecessary to examine the record of that which was
presented on the hearing of such motion.
But passing that, and assuming that we are at liberty to
examine, for any purpose, the bill of exceptions, the contentions of counsel in the brief are practically three in number:
First, that there was on the trial error in the admission of

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

testimony; second, that the verdict was against th6 evidence;
and, third, that the court erred in the instructions.
With reference to the first it may be remarked that the
offence charged against the defendants took place during and
was a part of the great strike, which was brought to the attention of this court in In re Deb8, 158 U. S. 564. One series of
objections under this head is to the introduction of telegrams,
some signed by the defendants, some by, Debs, and others by
still other parties, all of which upon their face have more or
less direct reference to the stopping of railroad trains. The
following are samples of these telegrams:
"EXHIBIT

"W. H. Clune, 1844 Naud St., Los Angeles, Calif.:
"Boycott against Pullman cars in effect at noon to-day by
order of convention.
E. V. DFBs."

Although all the evidence does not appear to have been
preserved in this bill of exceptions, enough is disclosed to
show that the government was' seeking to establish a conspiracy by circumstantial testimony, and telegrams of this
character, if identified and brought home to the defendants,
were obviously circumstances tending to show such conspiracy. It is familiar law that where a case rests upon that

CLUNE v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

character of evidence much discretion is left to the trial court,
and its ruling will be sustained if the testimony which is admitted tends even remotely to establish the ultimate fact.
Alexander v. United States, 138 U. S. 353; Holmes v. Goldsmith, 147 U. S. 150; Moore v. United States, 150 U. S. 57;
Thiede v. Utah Territory, 159 U. S. 510. There was no error
in admitting these telegrams.
Another series of objections is to the admission of the
declarations and acts of parties other than the defenfdants,
to wit, Gallagher and Buchanan, on the ground that they
were not parties to the record.
The indictment charged
the defendants with conspiring and combining together,
and with other persons. Now, if Gallagher and Buchanan
were conspirators with defendants, evidence of their acts and
declarations in carrying or attempting to carry into effect
the conspiracy was competent, and we must assume in the
silence of the record that it was shown that they were engaged in the conspiracy, and that their acts and declarations
were in execution thereof.
Again, it is insisted that the verdict was against the
evidence.
It is enough to say that such a contention cannot be sustained unless all the testimony, or all upon some
essential fact, is presented.
Finally, there is a claim of error in the instructions, but
the difficulty with this is that they are not legally before
us. True, there appears in the transcript that which purports to be a copy of the charge, marked by the clerk as
filed in his office among the papers in the case; but it is
well settled that instructions do not in this way become
part of the record. They must be incorporated in a bill of
exceptions, and thus authenticated by the signature of the
judge. This objection is essentially different from that of
the lack or the sufficiency of exceptions. An appellate court
considers only such matters as appear in the record. From
time immemorial that has been held to include the pleadings, the process, the verdict, and the judgment, and such
other matters as by some statutory or recognized method
have been made a part of it. There are, for instance, in
VOL. CLI X-38

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

some States statutes directing that all instructions must be
reduced to writing, marked by the judge "refused"
or
"given," and attested by his signature, and that when so
attested and filed in the clerk's office they become a part of
the record. But in the absence of that or some other statutory provision a bill of exceptions has been recognized as the
only appropriate method of bringing onto the record the
instructions given or refused. Struthers v. Drexel, 122 U. S.
487, 491; Supreme Court Rules No. 4, 108 U. S. 574; Insurance Company v. Radding, 120 U. S.1-83, 193; McArthur v.
Mitchell, 7 Kansas, 173; Moore v. Wade, 8 Kansas, 380;
Kshinka v. Cawker, 16 Kansas, 63; Lockhart v. Brown, 31
Ohio St. 431; Pettett v. Van Fleet, 31 Ohio St. 536.
Even if we were to ignore this lack of due authentication
we should be met with the want 'of any proper exceptions.
To the charge as apparently given on November 20, when
the case was submitted to the jury, there is no pretence of
any exception whatever. The journal entry of November 21
shows that the jury were brought into court and announced
that they had not agreed upon a verdict. Then follows this
statement: "Thereupon the court further instructs the jury
by reading written instructions to them, all of which is excepted to by the defendants' attorneys," and this is the only
exception having any reference to instructions to be found in
'the transcript. Exactly what was intended by it is not clear.
If the objection was simply to the time and manner of giving
instructions, the propriety of such action has been sustained
in Allis v. United States, 155 U. S. 117, 123. If to what was
contained in those instructions, then in addition to the fact
that they have not been preserved in any bill of exceptions
arises the further difficulty that no particular proposition is
called to the attention of the court.
These are all the matters pointed out by counsel in the
brief. At the argument in this court other counsel than
those whose names are on the brief appeared, and in addition
presented this further objection: By section 3995, Rev. Stat.,
the offence of obstructing the passage of the mails is made
I)unishable by a fine of not more than $100. Under section

CLUNE v. UNITED STATES.
Opini6n of the Court.

5440, Rev. Stat., a conspiracy to commit any offence against
the United States is punishable by a fine of not less than
$1000 nor more than $10,000, and by imprisonment for not
more than two years. Upon this he contended that a conspiracy to commit an offence cannot be punished more severely than the offence itself, and also that when the principal
offence is, in fact, committed, the mere conspiracy is merged
in it. The language of the sections is plain and not open to
doubt. A conspiracy to commit an offence is denounced as
itself a separate offence, and the punishment therefor fixed
'by the statute, and we know of no lack of power in Congress
to thus'-deal with a conspiracy. Whatever may be thought
of the wisdom or propriety of a statute making a conspiracy
to do an act punishable more severely than the, doing of
the act itself, it is a matter to be considered solely by the
legislative body. Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 555. The
power exists to separate the conspiracy from the act itself
and to affix distinct and independent penalties to each. With
regard to the suggestion that the conspiracy was merged in
the completed act, it is enough that we cannot, upon the
record, hold that the mails were obstructed. All the testimony not being preserved, it may be that the testimony satis,
fied the jury that there was, in fact, no obstruction of the
mails, but only as charged a-conspiracy to obstruct. If so,
the suggestion of a merger falls to the ground.
These are the only matters called to our attention. In
them we perceive no error, and the judgment is

Affirmed.
