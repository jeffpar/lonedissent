OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

WINONA & ST. PETER LAND COMPANY v.
MINNESOTA (No. 2).
ERROR 'TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA.
No. 88. Argued October 16, 1895. - Decided November 11, 1895.

The Federal question sought to be raised here not having been presented
in the state court, the case is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. James A. Tawney for plaintiff in error.
Mr. H. W. Childs, Attorney General of the State of Minnesota, for defendant in error. 211'. George B. Edgerton was on
his brief.
.Mr. John Lind filed a brief for defendant in error on
behalf of Brown County.
MR. JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the court.
This case is similar to the one between the same parties
just decided, in that the questions presented to the state
courts involved the taxability of lands included in the legislative grants of May 22, 1857, and March 10, 1862, the Barney
contract of October 31, 1867, and the decree in the United
States Circuit Court of March 7, 1887. The tax proceedings
were under the law of 1881, but were bad in the county of
Brown instead of the county of Redwood. The case, however, differs from the preceding, in that the Federal questions sought to be raised in this ,court were not seasonably
presented in the state cburts. The alleged immunity from
taxation and lack of due process, of law were not "specially
set up or claimed" prior to the decision in the Supreme Court.
The failure so to do prevents this court, as has been frequently
held, from acquiring jurisdiction. Spies v. Illinois, 123 U. S.

WEEKS v. BRIDGMAN.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA.
No. 44. Argued October 17, 1895. - Decided November 11, 1895.

In 1857 B., a mail contractor, applied to file a preemption declaratory statement for public land under the act of March 3, 1855, c. 201, 10 Stat. 683.
His application being rejected he appealed to the Commissioner of the
General Land Office, by whom the decision below was sustained. He then
appealed to the Secretary of the Interior, who in 1861 reversed the Land
Commissioner's decision. Meanwhile, in 1860, Congress passed an act
for his relief, (12 Stat. 843, c. 63,) and under that act he paid for the
land, and in 1871 received a patent in which it was stated that the land
had been certified to the State of Minnesota for railroad purposes by
mistake. This certification was made in 1864. Held, as between the
grantee, of B. and the grantee of a railroad company to which the land
had been conveyed by the State, that the title derived from B. must
prevail.
THIS was an action brought'by Charles A. Weeks against
Coleman Bridgman in the District Court for the Seventh
Judicial District of Minnesota under a statute of that State to
determine adverse claims to vacant and unoccupied real estate.
Judgment having been rendered for plaintiff, the cause was
taken to the Supreme Court of Minnesota on appeal, the
judgment reversed, and the causo remanded. 41 Minnesota,
352. The cause was again tried in the District Court by the
court, a jury having been expressly waived, and judgment entered for defendant, which, on a second appeal, was affirmed.
