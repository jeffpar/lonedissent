its bureau of taxes, is bound to see to it that its officers impart

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
No. 330. Argued and submitted January 6, 1891.-Decided

May 25, 1891.

The provision in Rev. Stat. § 3309, that if the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, on making a monthly examination of a distiller's return, "finds
that the distiller has used any grain or molasses in excess of the capacity
of his distillery as estimated according to law, he shall make an assessment against the distiller," etc., refers to the real average spirit-producing
capacity of the distillery and not to a fictitious capacity for any particular day or days.

JUSTICE

BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This was an action brought by the Chicago Distilling Company, the plaintiffs in error, against Rensselaer Stone, a collector of internal revenue, to recover a certain sum alleged to
have been unlawfully exacted by him from the plaintiffs, by
assessing them for a pretended excess of grain distilled by
them beyond the rated capacity of their distillery, in the
month of September, 1885. A jury was waived and the cause
was tried by the court upon an agreed statement of facts, and
judgment rendered for the defendant. The case is now here
on writ of error. In order to a better understanding of it a
few explanatory observations will be proper.
The law requires that every distillery, before operations are
commenced, shall be surveyed for the purpose of estimating
and determining its true spirit-producing capacity for a day of
twenty-four hours. Rev Stat. § 3264. This is done by ascertaining the number of fermenting tubs, the capacity of each,
and the fermenting period required for the particular process
to be followed. The distiller may use all of his tubs or only
a part of them. Those not used are sealed up by the collector
or his deputy, and the distiller is only charged for those which
are open, but he is obliged to pay the excise due for the full
spirit-producing capacity of the latter whether he manufactures the amount or not. If he uses any grain in excess of
the capacity of his distillery as estimated according to law, an
assessment is made against him at the rate of ninety cents for
every proof gallon of such excess. It is an assessment of this
kind of which the plaintiffs complain. Whenever a distiller
desires to open or close any of his tubs for the purpose of
increasing or reducing the capacity of his distillery, he must
give notice to that effect to the collector, who makes the
change by sealing or opening the tubs designated. Rev Stat.
§ 3311. It is not pretended that the plaintiffs failed in any
respect to comply with this reqmrement of the law, or that
they used, or ceased to use, any fermenting tubs without the
knowledge and sanction of the collector of internal revenue.

CHICAGO DISTILLING CO. v. STONE.
Opinion of the Court.

Another provision of the law requires that on the first of
each month a return shall be made to the collector by the distiller, or his principal manager, under oath, of the amount of
materials used for the production of spirits each day during
the previous month, and the number of gallons and proof-gallons of spirits produced and placed m the warehouse. Rev
Stat. §§ 3307, 3309.
In the present case there is no dispute as to the boncftdes of
the plaintiffs, or as to their business being conducted regularly
and lawfully in every way, unless the matter hereafter referred
to should be regarded as open to exception. The controversy
is explained by the agreed statement of facts, the material
parts of which are as follows:
"1. The Chicago Distilling Co., plaintiff herein, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Illinois,
paid to the defendant (then collector of internal revenue for
the first district of Illinois), under protest, the sum of fiftyseven dollars and eighty-three cents, on the 26th day of
August, 1886.
"2. The said company, in September, 1885, operated a duly
bonded and registered distillery, known as distillery No. 5,
first district of Illinois.
"3. By government survey the said distillery contained
fifteen fermenting tubs, numbered No. 1 to No. 15, inclusive,
each having a total working capacity of 438.46 bushels of
grain. It was using, under the said survey, a.three-day fermenting period, and under the regulations of the Treasury
Department the daily capacity of each fermenting tub was
one-third of the total working capacity - that is to say, 146.15
bushels of grain.
"4. The following table is a true statement of the openings
and closings of fermenting tubs and the mashings of grain and
distillations of spirits during September, 1885, and also of the
grain in mash brought forward from the preceding month,
and of the grain in mash carried forward to the succeeding
month, and the notices for such openings and closings of
fermenting tubs were duly filed in apt time and proper form,
and the designated fermenting tubs were regularly, by the

Opinion of the Court.

authorized agents of the government, opened at the times
specified, and the respective quantities of grain named in the
said table as mashed and distilled were the quantities which
were actually made and distilled, all as therein set forth under
appropriate headings."

headings and details of the latter part, from the 18th to the

"5. A certain assessment of tax in the sum of fifty-seven
dollars and eighty-three cents was made in regular form and
apt time against the Chicago Distilling Company by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, acting on behalf of the
IT S., and was duly certified to the defendant herein for collection from the plaintiff herein. The ground for said assessment was that during the month of September, 1885, as
decided by said Commissioner, there was used at said distillery for the production of spirits by the distiller, this
plaintiff, a certain quantity of grain, to wit, 294 - bushels,
in excess of the capacity of said distillery for said month as

"6. The demand for and collection of the said sum of
money from the plaintiff by the defendant was made by the
defendant under and by virtue of the said assessment by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
"7. The plaintiff, before the said tax was assessed, petitioned
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that the same be not

Opinion of the Court.

assessed, after the assessment was made he petitioned that the
assessment might be abated, and after payment as above set
forth he petitioned that the sum paid might be refunded, all
which petitions were denied by the said Commissioner."
The agreed statement then sets forth a document known as
Circular 238, being a regulation of the Treasury Department
issued in due form, and known to the plaintiffs. As we understand'the counsel for the government, it is claimed by the
defendant that this Circular fixes and defines the daily producing capacity of a distillery by taking the average capacity
of the fermenting period of three days, four days, or whatever
it may be. Thus if the fermenting period is three days, and
the producing capacity is 500 bushels of grain the first day,
500 the second day, and 200 the third day, the average for the
three days is 400 bushels, and the Circular makes this average
the daily capacity So long as the fermenting period comes
wholly within the calendar month no difficulty occurs, for
then the actual results of the three days' work agree with the
result for the same days produced by the fictitious daily capacity imposed by the Circular. But when, as in the present
case, it happens that two of the days come in one month (September) and the third comes in the next month (October), a
discrepancy arises in the former month between the fiction
and the fact. The three days in group came on the 29th and
30th of September and the 1st of October. The actual production, as well as capacity, on the first two days was 1315.50
bushels of distilled mash each day, being the product of three
tubs filled on the 25th of September and three others on the
26th of that month, whilst on the 1st of October the production was only 877 bushels, being the product of two tubs
filled on the 28th of September (Sunday, the 27th, not being
counted). The production of the whole three days, therefore,
was 3508 bushels (or, precisely, 3507.71 bushels), one-third of
which, namely, 1169.24, being the average production per day,
was prescribed by the department Circular as the daily producing capacity of the distillery at that time. This fictitious
estimate made the producing capacity of the last two days of
September equal to only 2338.48 bushels, whilst the actual pro-

CHICAGO DISTILLING CO. v. STONE.
Opinion of the Court.

duction for those two days was 2631 bushels, an excess of
292.52 bushels, which, together with some minute fractional
differences during the rest of the month, amounted in all to
2941.81 bushels, for which the assessment complained of by the
plaintiffs was made. Now, although this very excess of production over the estimated capacity in September will be
balanced by a corresponding deficiency in October, yet the
distiller gets no benefit from that. lHe never gets any credit
for deficiency, but is always charged extra for any excess.
It seems to us perfectly apparent from this statement that
the distiller is subjected to an unjust mulct, or assessment, by
a mere fiction. The counsel for the government argues that
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue could not do otherwise
than as he did in prescribing the requirements of Circular 238,
because the statute requires that the original survey of the
distillery shall determine its true spirit-producing capacity for
a day of twenty-four hours, and the same expression, producing capacity "for every twenty-four hours," is prescribed in
the form of notice to be given by the distiller in declaring his
intention to carry on the business, and in applying for a reduction or change of capacity in his establishment. Rev Stat.
§ 3259, 3311. But those expressions evidently mean no more
than average producing capacity in a given time. "A day of
twenty-four hours" is named for the purpose of expressing
with greater certainty and precision the exact period of duration for which the average capacity of production was to be
ascertained or fixed. That nothing but "average" was intended is manifest from the fact that no distillery under ordinary conditions has any spirit-producing capacity in twentyfour hours. It requires three days, four days and sometimes
six days, to produce the article desired. And the statute
which imposes an extra assessment for over-production does
not make the average daily capacity the standard, but merely
the capacity of the distillery The words are "If the commissioner finds that the distiller has used any grain or molasses
in excess of the capacity of his distillery as estimated according to law, he shall make an assessment against the distiller at
the rate of ninety cents for every proof-gallon of spirits that

should have been produced from the grain or molasses so used
in excess." Rev. Stat. § 3309. The expression, "the capacity
of his distillery as estimated according to law," clearly refers
to the real capacity as thus ascertained, and not to a fictitious
capacity for any particular day or days.
As the judgment of the court below was based upon the
view taken by the counsel of the government, we think it was
erroneous, and must be reversed. The judgment is accordingly
Reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to enter

No. 435. Submitted November 11,

1889.-Decided May 25, 1891.

The destination or character of spaces of ground, part of the public quay
or levee in the city of New Orleans, dedicated to public use, and locus
jpublicus by the law of Louisiana, is not changed so as to make them private property subject to be taken on execution for the debts of the city,
by a lease made pursuant to an ordinance of the city, by which the city
grants to an individual the exclusive right for twenty-five years to use
such spaces, designated by the city surveyor, and not nearer than one
hundred and fifty feet to the present wharves, for the purpose of erecting thereon, for the shelter of sugar and molasses landed at the quay,
fire-proof sheds, "with such accommodations and conveniences for the
transaction of business as may be necessary;" and also grants to him
the exclusive privilege of sheltering sugar and molasses landed at the
port; and authorizes him to charge prescribed rates on the sugar and
molasses sheltered under the sheds, and, in case those sheds "shall not
be of sufficient capacity to meet the demands of increased production, or
the requirements of commerce," to erect additional sheds on spaces to
be designated by the city; he agrees to keep the sheds in repair, and tp
pay the city one-tenth of such charges; the sheds are to revert to the
city on certain terms at the end of the lease; and right is reserved to
the wharfinger to enforce existing regulations against encumbering the
