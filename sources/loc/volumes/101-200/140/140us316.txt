LENT v. TILLSOT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CAIFORYIA.
No. 144. Argued January 8,9,1891.-Decided May 11, 1891.
The Statute of Califorma of 'March 23, 1876, entitled "An act to authorize
the widening of Dupont Street in the city of San Francisco" provides
for a due process of law for taking the property necessary for that purpose, and is not repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
Mere errors in the administration of a state statute which is not repugnant
to the Constitution of the United States will not authorize this court, in
its reexamination of the judgmeint of the state court on writ of error,
to hold that the State had deprived, or was about to deprive a party of
his property without due process of law.
The board of commissioners and the county court had jurisdiction to proceed in the execution of that statute.
A publication in a "supplement" to a newspaper of a notice ordered to be
published, is a compliance with the order.

THE case, as stated by the court, was as follows
"

"

This suit, which was commenced April 5, 1879, arises out of
an act of the legislature of California, approved MYarch 23,
1876, entitled "An act to authorize the widening of Dupont
Street in the city of San Francisco." An assessment was made
to meet the cost incurred in its execution. Provision was
made in the act to issue and sell bonds to meet such cost in
the first instance, and for the levy of an annual tax on the
lands benefited, in proportion to benefits, to pay the interest
on the bonds, and to create a sinking fund for the payment of
the principal debt. Bonds, dated January 1, 1876, to the
amount of one million dollars, were issued in the name of
the city and county of San Francisco, and made payable to
the holder in gold coin of the United States, twenty years
after date, with interest, payable half yearly, at the rate of
seven per cent per annum. The bonds recited that they were
issued under the above act, were to be paid out of the fund
raised by taxation as therein provided, and were taken by the
holder subject to the conditions expressed in its 22d section to

LENT v. TILLSON.
Statement of the Case.

be hereafter referred to. They were signed by the mayor,
auditor, and county surveyor, and attested by the official seal
of the city and county The plaintiffs in error, who were the
plaintiffs below, being owners of lots or parcels of land within
the district subject to the assessment, and claiming that the
statute was unconstitutional and void, brought this suit to
obtain a decree perpetually enjoining the defendant in error,
tax collector of the city and county of San Francisco, from
selling their property under the assessment. Holders of the
bonds to a large amount intervened and were made defendants.

The court of original jurisdiction - the Superior Court

of the city and county of San Francisco -rendered a decree
giving the relief asked. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court
of California that decree was reversed and the cause remanded
with directions to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the complaint.
The statute in question contains many provisions. The
first section provides that, subject to the provisions of the act,
Dupont Street m San Francisco should be increased to the
uniform width of 74 feet (measuring westerly from its then
easterly line) from the northerly line of Market Street to the
southerly line of Filbert Street, the grades of the intersecting
cross streets to be adjusted by the Board of Supervisors so as
to make them conform to the grade of the west line of Dupont
Street to be established by the Board of Supervisors, which
was empowered to pass all necessary orders for that purpose.
The second section provides that the value of the land taken
for the widening of the street, and the damages to improvements thereon or adjacent thereto, which may be injured
thereby, and all expenses whatsoever incident to such widening, "shall be held to be the cost of widening said street, and
shall be assessed upon the district hereinafter described as
benefited by said widening, in the manner hereinafter provided." The district declared to be benefited, and upon
which the cost of making the improvement was directed to
be assessed, is defined in the act, and it was provided in section 3 that in case Dupont Street be not widened further
north than Bush Street, then the districts to be benefited

.

Statement of the Case.

"shall be bounded on the north by the southerly liun of Bush
Street, and on the south by the northerly line of Market Street."
/ The majority in value of the property owners fronting on
Dupont Street, between Market and Bush streets, were
allowed to defeat the proposed improvements between those
streets, and to relieve that portion of the assessment district
from any burden on account of it, by filing a written protest
at any time within thirty days after the notice provided for in
/ section 6 of the act to be presently referred to. No such protest was filed. The act also provided that unless within that
time a majority of property owners fronting on Dupont
Street, between Bush and Filbert streets, should petition for it,
there should be no widening north of Bush Street, and that
portion of the assessment district should be excluded. No
such petition was filed, and the widening was limited to the
four blocks between Market and Bush streets. (Section 12.)
The mayor and auditor of the city and county of San Francisco, together with the city and county surveyor, and their
successors in, office, were constituted by section 4 a "Board of
Dupont Street Commissioners," the mayor to be ex offcio
V president of the board. The Board of Supervisors of the city
and county were authorized, if they deemed it expedient that
Dupont Street be widened in the mode prescribed, to express
such judgment by resolution or order within sixty days after
the passage of the act, and if they failed to do so no further
proceedings were to be had or taken, under the act, for any
purpose, and the street was not to be widened. (Section 21.)
v' As soon as convenient after the passage of such a resolution
or order by the Board of Supervisors, the Dupont Street Commissioners were directed to "publish a notice, for not less than
ten days, in two of the daily papers printed in the city of San
Francisco, informing property owners along the line of said
street that the board is organized, and inviting all persons interested in property sought to be taken, or which would be injured by said widening, to present to the board maps and plans
of their respective lots, and a written statement of the nature
/ of their claim and interest in such lots." (Section 6.) The
Board of Commissioners, having prepared and adopted suitable

LENT v. TILLSON.
Statement of the Case.

maps, plans and diagrams, were required to ascertain and determine and separately state in a written report, to be signed by
at least a majority of its members, the description and actual
cash value of the several lots and subdivisions of land and buildings included in the land taken for the widening of Dupont
Street, and the damage done to the property along the line of
the street, specifying and describing in their report each lot
and subdivision or piece of property taken or injured by the
widening of the street, as far as an accurate description thereof
was furnished by the owners, and setting down against each
lot, subdivision or piece of property the names of the owners,
occupants and claimants thereof, or of the persons interested
therein, as lessees, incumbrancers or otherwise, and the particulars of their interest, as far as they could be ascertained,
and the amount of value or damage determined upon for the
same, respectively If, in any case, the board found that conflicting claims of title existed, or were in ignorance or doubt as
to the ownership of any lot of land, or of any interest therein,
the lot was to be set down as belonging to unknown owners.
The board was also directed to embody in a written report a
description of the subdivisions or lots of land included in the
districts designated in section three of the act, and to set against/
each lot or subdivision the amount in which, according to the
judgment of the board, such lot will be benefited by reason of
the widening of the street, relatively to the benefits accruing to
other lots of land within the designated districts also setting
against each lot or subdivision the names of the owners, lessees
and claimants thereof, so far as the same can be ascertained
conveniently, and if not ascertained, setting them down to unknown owners. Error, however, in the designation of the owner
or owners of any lot taken or assessed was not to affect the
validity of the assessment. Suitable maps, plans or diagrams,
showing the property taken and assessed for the improvement,
in lots and subdivisions, with the names of the owners, lessees
and claimants, as far as known to said board, were to be attached to the report. "Such report," the act provided, "as soon
as the same is completed, shall be left at the office of said board

Any person interested in any piece or parcel of land situated

within the district defined/and described in section three of
the act, or in any of the lands taken for Dupont Street, or in
any improvements damaged by the opening of that .street, feeling himself aggrieved by the action or determination of the
board, as shown in its report,i'vas entitled, at any time within
the thirty days mentioned in section seven of the act, to apply
by petition to the County Court of the city and county of
San Francisco, setting forth his interest in the proceedings had
before the board, and his objections thereto, for an order requiring it to file with that court its report, and such other
documents or data as may be pertinent thereto, in its custody

authorized and empowered to hear said petition, and shall set
the same down for a hearing within ten days from the date
of the filing thereof; and the party filing said petition shall, on
the day he files the same, serve a copy thereof on at least one
of the members of the Board of Commissioners, and said
board may appear by counsel, or otherwise, before said court,
in response to said petition. Said board may file a written
answer to said petition with said court. Testimony may
be taken by said court upon said hearing, and the process of
the court may be used to compel the attendance of witnesses,
and the production of books, or papers or maps in the custody
of said board, or otherwise. It shall be in the discretion of
said court, after hearing and considering said application, to
allow said order or deny the same, and if granted, a copy
thereof shall be served on said board, and it shall proceed to
obey the same according to the terms of the order to be prescribed by the court. But in case no such petition shall be
filed with said county court within the time above limited
for the filing thereof, the said report shall be presented by the
said -board to the said county court, with a petition to the

court that the same be approved and confirmed by the court.
The court shall have power to approve and confirm said report, or refer the same back to said board, with directions to
alter or modify the same in the particulars specified by the
court in the order referring the same back, and thereupon the
said board shall proceed to make the alterations and modifications specified in the order of said court. The alterations and
modifications aforesaid being made, the report shall be again
submitted to the said court, and if the court, upon examination, shall find that the- alterations and modifications have
been made according to the directions contained in said order,
the said court shall approve and confirm the same by an
order to be entered on its minutes, but if the said board shall
have neglected or failed to make the alterations and modifications set forth in the order of reference, the court may again
refer the report back to said board, and so on until its original
order of alteration and modification shall have been complied
with by said board, and the said court shall then approve and
,confirm said report." (Section 8.)
All damages, costs and expenses arising from, or incidental
to, the widening of the street, being fixed and determined by
the final confirmation of the report, as in the act provided,
the board was to issue bonds of the city and county of San
Francisco, in such form as they might prescribe, in sums of
not less than one thousand dollars each, for such an amount
as shall be necessary to pay and discharge all such damages,
costs and expenses, the bonds to be known and designated
as the "Dupont Street Bonds," and payable in twenty years
from their date, unless sooner redeemed, as in the act provided, bearing interest at seven per cent per annum, payable
semi-annually at the office of the treasurer of the city and
county, such interest being evidenced by coupons attached to
each bond, and signed by the president of the board. (Section 9.) Any person or persons to whom damages were
awarded, according to the provisions of the act, upon tendering to the board a satisfactory deed of conveyance to the city
and county of the land for which damages were so awarded,
was entitled to have bonds in an amount equal to the sum of

the damages awarded for the lands so conveyed, together
with damages for the improvements thereon or affected

thereby, and the bonds so issued and delivered were to be
in full compensation for all damages for lands and improvements taken and improvements injured, as contemplated in
the act. (Section 10.)
The mayor, auditor and treasurer were authorized to sell
bonds sufficient to realize money enough to meet and discharge
all expenses and damages arising from the widening of the
street, established by the report as finally confirmed. The
money arising from their sale was to be known and designated
as the "Dupont Street Fund." As soon as the bonds were converted into money, as in the act provided, the Board of Commissioners were required to give public notice, in two daily
newspapers published in the city and county, for at least ten
days, that they were prepared to pay in full all damages and
liabilities fixed by the final report of the board (not then
already discharged), and upon receiving from the parties
entitled thereto the proper deeds or proper acquittances from
those entitled to compensation, the board were to give to
such party an order upon the treasury for the amount shown
to be due, payable out of the "Dupont Street Fund." (Section 11.) Provision was made by the act for the levy and collection annually, at the same time and in the same manner as
other taxes are levied and collected in the city and county,
of taxes upon the lands described m the third section sufficient
to pay the interest on the bonds as it matured, and, also, sufficient to raise one-twentieth of the principal, and to constitute
a sinking fund for the redemption of the bonds; such taxes to
be collected out of the land only, to be adjusted and distributed
according to the enhanced values of the lands as fixed in the
final report of the board, and to go into the hands of the
treasurer of the city and county, as part of the "Dupont Street
Fund." (Section 13.) It was made the duty of the Board of
Commissioners to cause block books to be prepared, exhibiting the district declared by the act to be benefited by the
opening of Dupont Street, according to the blocks or fractional
parts of blocks thereof, and the subdivisions, according to which

LENT v. TILLSON.
Statement of the Case.

the benefits were fixed and determined, also, in convenient
book form, descriptions of the several subdivisions shown on
such books -the amount of benefits or enhanced value to the
subdivision, as established by the confirmed report, by reason
of the opening of the street, being set opposite to each description of the several subdivisions. The block books and description note books, being certified by the board, were to be held
by the assessor of the city and county of San Francisco as a
part of the records of his office until all the bonds issued in
pursuance of the act were-redeemed. (Section 14.)
In case any person to whom, or in whose favor, damages
were awarded by the board should fail or neglect, for the
period of twenty days after there were funds to the credit of
the "Dupont Street Fund" sufficient to pay such damages, to
ask for and receive from the board a warrant for the sum so
awarded, it could draw a warrant upon the treasurer in favor
of such owner or owners, and deposit the same with the clerk
of the city and county, accompanied by a certificate of the
treasurer that the warrant so drawn and deposited had been
registered by him, and that there were funds in his hands to
pay the same, and thereupon the board, on demand, was
entitled to an order of the county court authorizing it to
enter upon such piece of land and remove obstructions therefrom, and to throw open the lots so described as part of the
street, and an execution could issue to the sheriff, commanding
him to put the board in possession of such lot for the city and
county; and thereafter, upon delivering to the county court
a sufficient deed conveying said lot of land to the said city and
county, the party so dispossessed was entitled to receive the
value of the land so conveyed, or the warrant of the board
therefor. (Section 16.) If the owners of any lands taken for
the street failed or neglected, within the space of thirty days
after the money was in the treasury to pay the same, to remove the buildings and improvements from such lands, and
deliver possession of said lands to said board, on tender to
them respectively of the sums awarded as the value of such
lands, buildings or improvements, then the board could, at
any time thereafter, sell such buildings and improvements at

public auction to the highest bidders, to be removed by the
respective purchasers thereof, the sums bid at such sales to be
paid in cash or in the warrants of the board, and if at such
auction there shall be no responsible bidder for such improvements, with the obligation to remove them within the time
specified in the terms of sale, the board was to remove the
same at the cost of the "Dupont Street Fund." (Section 17.)
The street, when widened, was to be sewered, graded, sidewalked and paved by the municipal authorities, the expense
of such work to be assessed upon the adjacent property, or
borne by the city and county, in the same manner as if the
street remained of its original width. (Section 18.) The
railway tracks in the street were required to be removed and
changed to the centre of the same by the street railroad companies then using tracks therein. (Section 19.)
The last section of the act, section 22, provided that the
completion of the work should be deemed an absolute acceptance, by the owners of all lands affected by the act and by
their successors in interest, of the lien created by it upon the
several lots so affected, and operate as an absolute waiver of
all clain in the future upon the city and county of San Francisco, and their successors in interest, for any part of the debt
created by the bonds authorized to be issued. "This shall be
regarded as a contract between said owners and the holders of
said bonds and said city and county, and this provision shall
be stated on the face of the bonds." Stat. California, 1875-6,

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of California, under
its order, made his certificate to the effect that in this suit and

Opinion of the Court.

appeal there was drawn m question the validity of the above
act of March 23, 1876, and the authority exercised and the
proceedings taken under it, on the ground that the statute
and said authority and proceedings were repugnant to the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States, and that the decision of that court was m favor of
their validity
The provisions of the statute, to which we have referred,
sufficiently indicate its scope and effect, and enable us (without referring to others that relate to matters of mere detail)
to determine whether or not the act, upon its face or by its
necessary operation, is repugnant to that clause of the Constitution declaring that no State shall deprive any person of
property without due process of law
We have seen that the statute defined the district benefited
by the widening of Dupont Street, and upon which the assessment to meet the cost of the work was to be imposed, made
it a condition precedent to the proposed improvement that it
should be declared by resolution or order of the Board of Supervisors of the city and county to be expedient, directed
that, after the passage of such a resolution or order, the Dupont Street Commissioners should publish, for not less than
ten days, in two daily papers in San Francisco, a notice informing property owners along the line of the street of its
organization, and inviting all persons interested in property
sought to be taken, or that would be injured by the widening
of that street, to present descriptions of their respective lots,
and a statement in writing of their interest in them, allowed
the majority in value of owners of property within the district
embracing the lands of the plaintiffs, at any time within thirty
days after the last publication of the above notice, by written:
protest filed with the Board of Commissioners, to defeat altogether the proposed widening of Dupont Street, required the
board to prepare a written report showing the description and
actual cash value of the several lots and subdivisions of land
and buildings included in the land proposed to be taken for
the widening of the street, the value and damage determined
upon for the same respedtvely and the amount in which,

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.

according to its judgment, each lot had been or would be benefited by reason of the widening of the street, relatively to the
benefits accruing to other lots of land within the designated
district, and directed suck report, as soon as completed, to be
left at the office of the board daily, during ordinary business
hours, for the free inspection of all persons interested, and
notice of the same being open for inspection at such time and
place published by the board daily, for twenty days, in two
daily newspapers printed and published in the city and
county

But this was not all. For any person interested, and who
felt himself aggrieved by the action or determination of the
board, as indicated by its report, was permitted, at any time
within, the above thirty days, to apply by petition to the
county court of the city and county, showing his interest in
the proceedings of the Board of Commissioners, and his objections thereto, for an order that would bring before that court
the report of the board, together with such pertinent documents or data as were in its custody, and were used in preparing its report. It was made the duty of the party filing
the petition to serve, on the same day, a copy thereof on at
least one of the members of the Board of Commissioners, who
were at liberty to appear by counsel, or otherwise, and make
answer to it. The court was also empowered to hear the petition, and set it down for hearing within ten days from its
being filed. Provision was made for the taking of testimony
upon the hearing, and the court was authorized to use its process to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production
of books, papers or maps in the custody of the board, or
otherwise. The discretion given to the court, after hearing
and considering the application, to allow or to deny the order
prayed for was, of course, to be exercised judicially, according
to the showing made by the petitioners. And that complete
justice might be done, the court was invested with power, not
simply to approve and confirm the report of the board, but to
refer it back with directions to alter or modify the same in the
particulars specified by the court. Until such alterations and
modifications were made, the court was under no duty to

LENT v. TILLSOIN.
Opinion of the Court.

approve or confirm the report, and until it was approved and
confirmed, the board was without authority to proceed at all
in the work committed to it by the statute.
Were not these provisions in substantial conformity with
the requirements of "due process of law" as recognized in the
decisions of this court 2 In Davidson v -New Orleans,96 U. S.
97, 104, it was said that "whenever, by the laws of a State,
or by state authority, a tax, assessment, servitude or other
burden is imposed upon property for the public use, whether
it be for the whole State or of some more limited portion of
the community, and those laws provide for a mode of confirming or contesting the charge thus imposed, in the ordinary
courts of justice, with such notice to the person or such proceeding in regard to the property as is appropriate to the
nature of the case, the judgment in such proceedings cannot
be said to deprive the owner of his property without due
process of law, however obnoxious it may be to other objections." So m Hagar v Reclamation .- istrict, 111 U. S. 701,
708 "Undoubtedly, where life and liberty are involved, due
process requires that there be a regular course of judicial proceedings, which imply that the party to be affected shall have
notice and an opportunity to be heard, so, also, where title
or possession of property is involved. But, where the taking
of property is in the enforcement of a tax, the proceeeding is
necessarily less formal, and whether notice to him is at all
necessary may depend upon the character of the tax and the
manner in which its amount is determinable.
As stated
by Mr. Justice Bradley in his concurring opinion in Davidson v
.New OrZeans, 'in judging what is due process of law, respect
must be had to the cause and object of the taking, whether the
taxing power, the power of eminent aomain or the power of
assessment for local improvements, or some of these, and, if
found to be suitable or admissible in the special case, it will
be adjudged to be "due process of law," but if found to be
arbitrary, oppressive and unjust, it may be declared to be not
due process of law "' Of the different kinds of taxes which a
State may impose, and of which from their nature no notice
can be given, the court, in that case, enumerates poll taxes,

licenses (not dependent upon the extent of business) and specific taxes on things, persons or occupations.

p. 709.

These principles were reaffirmed in Kentucky Rairoad Tax
Cases, 115 U S. 321, 331, and in .pencerv ]Merchant, 125 U. S.
345, 355, in the latter of which cases it was said that "the legislature, in the exercise of its power of taxation, has the right.
to direct the whole or part of the expense of a public improvement, such as the laying, grading or repairing [and, equally,
the widening] of a street, to be assessed upon the owners of
lands benefited thereby," and that, "the determination of the
territorial district whih should be taxed for a local improvement is within the province of legislative discretion," also,
that, "if the legislature -provides for notice to and hearing of
each proprietor, at some stage of the proceedings, upon the
question what proportion of the tax shall be assessed upon his.
land, there is no taking of his property without due process of
law"
Tested by these principles, the statute providing for the
widening of Dupont Street cannot be held to be repugnant to
the constitutional requirement of due process of law The
notice by publication to all who owned property liable to be
assessed for the cost of that improvement was appropriate to
the nature of the case, and was reasonable in respect to the,
length of time prescribed for the publication. And ample.
opportunity was given to all persons interested to test in a.
court of competent jurisdiction the fairness and legality of
any assessment proposed to be made upon their property for
the purposes indicated by the statute. That court had power
to require such alterations or modifications of the report of
the Board of Commissioners as justice demanded. It was not
bound to approve any report that did not conform to its judgment as to what was right, and without such confirmation
the board could not proceed in the execution of the work
contemplated by the legislature.
If we had any doubt of the correctness of these views, we
should accept the interpretation which the highest court of
the State places upon the statute. When the inquiry is
whether a state enactment under which property is proposed

LENT v. TILLSON.
Opinion of the Court.

to be taken for a public purpose accords full opportunity to
the owner, at some stage of the proceedings involving his
property, to be heard as to their regularity or validity, we
must assume that the inferior courts and tribunals of the State
will give effect to such enactment as interpreted by the highest court of that State. The Supreme Court of California,
speaking by Mr. Justice Temple, in this case, has said. "We
are not considering here a statute which is silent as to the hearing. The provisions in question were undoubtedly inserted
in view of the constitutional requirement, and for the purpose
of affording that opportunity to be heard, without which the
law would be void. To give the statute the construction contended for would not only defeat the evident purpose, but
would make the whole proceeding farcical. And I must confess, it seems to me, it requires great industry in going wrong,
in view of all the circumstances, to conclude that such can be
the meaning. Inapt words certainly are found in the section,
[§ 8,] but it would not have provided so elaborately for a thorough investigation for grievances if it were not intended that
redress should be awarded. The statute has apparently been
patched and tinkered after it was first drawn, and incongruous
matter injected into the body of it. But it still provides for a
full hearing, and that the court may alter and modify And
it seems that such action is to be based upon the hearing provided for. The word 'discretion' is used in various meanings,
but here, evidently, it was intended to submit the whole matter
to the sound judgment of the court to be exercised according
to the rules of law" 72 California, 404, 421.
It is said that the county court was without power to
adjudge the statute to be unconstitutional, and had no discretion, except to confirm the report, or to require it to be altered
or modified. We do not perceive that this is a material inquiry, so long as the statute is not repugnant to the constitution.
But we do not admit that the county court was without power
to hold it to be unconstitutional and void - if such was its
view-and to decline, upon that ground alone, to confirm
any report that the Board of Commissioners might have filed.
The judge or judges of that court were obliged, by their oath

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

of office, and in fidelity to the supreme law of the land, to
refuse to give effect to any statute that was repugnant to that
law, anything in the statute or the constitution of the State
to the contrary notwithstanding. Upon this subject, as well
as in respect to the power of the county court to consider
objections of every nature that might be made to the confirmation of any report from the Board of County Commissioners, the Supreme Court of the State said. "The statute
does not expressly authorize the court to pass upon the validity of the act, or whether the Board of Supervisors had passed
the necessary resolution, or the notices had been given. But
the power to do this is necessarily involved in the power
of the court to act at all. It may be that the court could not
pass upon these questions upon which its jurisdiction depended,
so as to conclude all inquiry even on a collateral attack It
was a constitutional court, invested with jurisdiction by the
constitution of special cases. The parties had full notice of
the proceeding, and of their right to be heard." Again "The
statute places no limit upon the objections which might be
made by those deeming themselves aggrieved by the action
or determination of the board as shown in the report. As
all their determinations which could affect any person were
required to appear in the report, this would seem to include
all possible objections. The determination, for instance, might
have been objected to, because, the act being invalid or the
notices not having been given, the board had no right to proceed to act at all. If this contention were sustained, the
result would have been that the court would not have confirmed the report, and the proceedings would have ended without fixing a charge upon the property of plaintiffs. They
could have complained that a wrong basis was adopted in
estimating damages or benefits; that the estimated cost was
too much, or for any misconduct of the commissioners which
could affect them, or that the cost exceeded the estimated
benefits, and it does not seem to me that the court would have
found any difficulty in granting relief." 72 California, 404,422.

out due process of law

This contention is material only so

far as it involves the inquiry as to whether the tribunals
charged by the statute with the execution of its provisions
acquired jurisdiction to proceed in respect to the lots or lands
in question and the owners thereof. Jurisdiction was, of
course, essential before the plaintiff's property could have
been burdened with this assessment. But errors in the mere
administration of the statute, not involving jurisdiction of the
subject and of the parties, could not justify this court, in its
reexamination of the judgment of the state court, upon writ
of error, to hold that the State had deprived, or was about to
deprive, the plaintiffs of their property without due process of
law Whether it was expedient to widen Dupont Street, or
whether the Board of Supervisors should have so declared, or
whether the Board of Commissioners properly apportioned the
costs of the work or correctly estimated the benefits accruing
to the different owners of property affected by the widening
of the street, or whether the board's incidental expenses in
executing the statute were too great, or whether a larger
amount of bonds were issued than should have been, the excess, if any, not being so great as to indicate upon the face of
the transaction a palpable and gross departure from the requirements of the statute, or whether upon the facts disclosed
the report of the commissioners should have been confirmed,
are, none of them, issues presenting Federal questions, and the
judgment of the state court, upon them, cannot be reviewed
here.
Upon the issue as to whether the Board of Commissioners
and the county court acquired jurisdiction to proceed in the
execution of the statute, the evidence is full and satisfactory
The Board of Supervisors of the city and county, by resolution
within sixty days after the passage of the act, declared it to
be expedient and necessary that Dupont Street should be
widened in accordance with the statute. § 2. In conformity
with this. declaration the mayor, auditor and county surveyor of the city organized as a Board of Dupont Street Commissioners, and by notice, published for not less than ten days,

erty owners along the line of that street of such organization,
and invited all persons interested in property sought to be
taken, or which would be injured by the widening of Dupont
Street, to present to it maps and plans of their respective lots,
and a written statement of the nature of their claim or interest in such lots.

§ 6.

The Board of Commissioners caused to

be prepared and adopted maps, plans and diagrams, and made
the written report required by section 7 of the act, and such
report was left at the office daily, during ordinary business
hours, for thirty days, for the free inspection of all interested,
notice that such report was so open for inspection for such
time and at such place being published by the board daily, as
required by that section, in two daily newspapers printed-and
published in the city and county of San Francisco. Various
parties who were interested in and affected by the widening
of the street brought before the county court of the city and
county, by petition filed in due time, the written report of the
commissioners and all documents in their possession. The
hearing of these petitions resulted in certain alterations and,
modifications of the report, and, on the 20th of December,
1876, the county court made its final order of confirmation.
That order, after reciting in detail the performance of all the
acts required by the statute in execution of its provisions, proceeded "And it further appearing to the court that all the
proceedings taken by said board have been duly and legally
taken, and that each and all of the acts, matters and things.
provided by said act to be done and performed by said board
in the premises, have, on the part of said board, been duly
and regularly done and performed in the form, at the times,
and in the manner prescribed by said act, and said board having this day brought the said report, as so modified, into this
court, and duly filed a petition in this court praying that said
report, as so modified by -this court, be confirmed and approved Now, therefore, after hearing all the proofs in the
said matter, and on motion of Win. Pierson, Esq., attorney for
said Board of Dupont Street Commissioners, and no one
objecting thereto, and after full consideration thereof, it is
ordered, adjudged and decreed that the said report of the said

Opinion of the Court.

Board of Dupont Street Commissioners, in the matter of the
widening of Dupont Street, filed in this court on the 27th day
of October, A.D. 1876, as modified by said board under the
orders of this court heretofore made herein, and as the same
now exists on file herein, be and the same is hereby fully and
in all respects approved and confirmed. And it is further
ordered, adjudged and decreed that the lands described in the
volume of said report, entitled 'IReport Damages Widening
Dupont Street,' be, and the same are hereby taken and dedicated for an open and public street, and for the widening of
said Dupont Street, between Bush and Market streets, and
that the title thereto, and every part thereof, as particularly
described in said volume of said report, is vested in the city
and county of San Francisco for the purpose of said street forever, upon the payment in the manner prescribed by said act,
to the owners of each piece or parcel of such land, and to the
owners of the improvements thereon, or upon the deposit or
tender as prescribed by said act, of the amounts fixed and
determined in and by said volume of said report." Subsequently to this order, the street was widened in accordance
with the report, and, as widened, is in public use, the special
benefits of the improvement, whether more or less, being enjoyed by the plaintiffs, and by others in like situation.
It is contended that the notices required by the different
sections of the act to be published for a designated number of
days were not so published. This contention rests, principally, upon the ground that the notices, on some-of the days,
appeared in a "Supplement" of some of the newspapers, and
not in the body of the paper where reading matter was
usually found. There is no force in this objection, and it does
not deserve serious consideration.
Other objections have been urged by the plaintiffs which
we do not deem it necessary to consider. For instance, it is
said that the mayor of the city of San Francisco, one of the
Board of Commissioners, was himself the owner of a lot on
Dupont Street, and, for that reason, was incompetent to act
as one of the Board of Street Commissioners, that some of
the alterations and modifications of the report of the com-

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Syllabus.

nnssioners made upon the hearing in the county court of the
petitions filed by different parties were so made under private
arrangements between the commissioners and those parties, of
which other property owners along Dupont Street had no
notice, and by which such owners were injuriously affected,
that the Board of Commissioners selected experts to "assist"
it in estimating the damages for property taken and injured
by the proposed improvement and the benefits accruing
therefrom, and that the report of those experts was accepted
by the commissioners, without themselves making or attemptng to make an appraisement of -damages or an assessment of
benefits under the statute, and that such appraisement and
assessment were not in fact correct, fair or just, but were
fraudulent. In respect to all these and like objections, it is
sufficient to say that they do not necessarily involve any
question of a Federal nature, and, so far as this court is concerned, are concluded by the decision of the Supreme Court of
California.
We are of opinion, upon the whole case, that the Supreme
Court of California correctly held that the plaintiffs had not
been, or were not about to be, deprived of their property, in
violation of the Constitution of the United States.
