CITY OF SAVANNAH v. MARTIN.
Opinion of the Court.

It does not detract from the force of this conclusion that the
guaranty recites that it was authorized by a public meeting of
the citizens thereof, as if it were the case of bonds issued under
the act of 1856, which required the recommendation of such a
meeting. But if the fact is immaterial, the recital is hot injurious. And the oLicial record of the transaction shows that
such a meeting was held for the purpose of quieting doubts,
and not to raise them. The authorities of the city at that time
were only anxious to omit nothing which the most critical
might regard as important in securing for its obligations all the
weight and value properly belonging to an unquestionable
pledge of its faith and credit; and certainly now, after the
lapse of twenty years, in which no such question has been
raised, it would, in the language of Mr. Justice Grier, in
.fercer County v. Hacket, 1 Wall. 83, "be contrary to good
faith and common justice to permit them to allege a newly discovered construction of an equivocal power." -FanTosup v.
.fadson, City, 1 Wall. 291; -feyer v. City of ifusatine, 1
Wall. 384; James v. .ilwaukee, 16 Wall. 159.
In our opinion the act of 1838 authorized the guaranty made
by the city of Savannah upon the bonds of the railroad company, and it constitutes a valid and subsisting liability. This
disposes of the only question in the case deserving serious
consideration; and the judgment of the circuit court is therefore
Affirmed.
