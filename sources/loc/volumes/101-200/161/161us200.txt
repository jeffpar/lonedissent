opinion of the court.
It is quite questionable whether section 30 of the act incorporating the Memphis Life and General Insurance Company
grants to that company any immunity from taxation. Without
discussing or deciding that question, however, we think that,

Phoenix Insurance Company, just decided. 'Upon authority
of that case, therefore, this judgment must be
