UNITED STATES v. STANFORD.
APPEAL

FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

INTH

CrROUIT.
Wo. 783. Argued January 28, 29, 1896. -Decided

March 2, 1896.

An examination of the statutes of the United States relating to the construction of a railroad from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, especially
the acts of July 1, 1862, c. 120, 12 Stat. 489, and July 2, 1864, c. 216, 13 Stat.
356, shows that every subscriber to the Union Pacific Railroad Company
must be deemed to have become such upon the condition, imrplied by law,
that he should not be personally liable for the debts of the corporation.
It is equally clear that Congress intended to grant national aid to all the
corporations constructing that connecting line of railroad upon terms
and conditions applicable alike to all, with no purpose to make discriminations against any one part of the line, and that the imposition of a
liability upon the stockholders of the Central Pacific Railroad Company
for the debt of that corporation, arising out of the bonds which it received from the United States, when no such liability was imposed upon

ONITED STATES v. STANFORD.
Opinion of the Court.
the Union Pacific Railroad Company on account of like bonds received
by It, is entirely inconsistent with that equality.
The United States has no claim against the stockholders of the Central
Pacific Railroad Company on account of the bonds issued to that company by the United States to aid in the construction of its road.
This adjudication is not to be taken as deciding that the stockholders of
the Central Pacific Railroad Company either can or cannot be made liable
for its debts to the United States in some other way than under the
Pacific railroad acts and by the acceptance of the United States bonds to
aid in the construction of the road; nor whether the adoption of the
California corporation as an instrument of the national government in
accomplishing a national object, exempted its stockholders from liability,
under the constitution and laws of California, to ordinary creditors.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Solicitor General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General
Dickinson for appellants.
.XP. Joseph H. Choate, (with whom was -Mr. Russell J.
Wilson on the brief,) for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE HARL

delivered the opinion of the court.

The United States seeks by this suit to establish a claim
against the estate of Leland Stanford for fifteen millions two
hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars.
The deceased held and owned a large number of the shares
of the capital stock of the Central Pacific Railroad Company
of California, and the Western Pacific Railroad Company corporations that were organized under the laws of California,
and which subsequently were consolidated and became the
Central Pacific Railroad Company.
Those companies received bonds of the United States that
were issued under the acts of Congress known as the Pacific
Railroad Acts in aid of the construction of a railroad and
telegraph line extending from the Missouri River to the
Pacific Ocean. Tha present demand of the government
arises out of the obligation which, it is alleged; rested upon
the companies receiving such bonds to pay the principal at
maturity and to reimburse the United States for all interest
paid thereon.

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

The bill proceeds upon the ground that by the constitution
and laws of California, at the time the above corporations
were organized, as well as when they received the bonds of
the United States, each stockholder of a railroad corporation
was liable, in proportion to the stock owned and held by
him, for all of its debts and liabilities, and, consequently, that
the estate of Stanford is liable to the United States in proportion to the stock owned and held by him in the corporations named.
The principal contention of. the defendant is, that the
question of the liability of stockholders for the debts and
obligations of companies receiving bonds of the United States
under the Pacific Railroad Acts, does not depend upon the
laws of California, but is governed by the acts of Congress
under which such bonds were issued; that by its legislation
in aid of the construction of the Union and Central Pacific
railroads Congress intended to define, control, and regulate
the entire relations of the government to all of the companies
receiving subsidy bonds without reference to the laws of
any State; that those companies were respectively created or
adopted as agencies for a great national purpose, in the accomplishment of which they were to be subject to the exclusive
control of the general government; that the functions, obligations and liabilities of all the companies participating in the
bounty of the United States were to be equal and identical;
and that as to each company the government looked to it
alone for the performance of all that the acts imposed upon
it, and did not contemplate, nor intend that there should be
any individual liability of stockholders in respect of the subsidy bonds issued by the United States.
If these acts of Congress have the scope and effect attributed
to them by the defendant, the decree may be affirmed without
any expression of opinion by this court upon other questions
discussed at the bar, and which, if considered, would require a
construction of the laws of California relating to the personal
liability of stockholders for the debts of railroad corporations.
Was it part of the contract between the United States and
the corporations receiving its subsidy bonds that the stock-

UNITED STATES v. STANFORD.
Opinion of the Court.

holders of such corporations, respectively, should be personally liable for the principal and interest of those bonds? Or,
did the United States make provision in the acts of Congress
for all the security intended to be taken for their payment?
These questions cannot be answered by referring to any one
section of either act, but only by examining the provisions of
all of those acts in the light of the circumstances under which
the United States made grants of public lands and provided
for the issuing of bonds in aid of the construction of a railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific
Ocean.
By the act of July 1, 1862, c. 120, 12 Stat. 489, entitled "An
act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line
from the -Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to
the government the use of the same for postal, military and
other purposes," the Union Pacific Railroad Company was
incorporated with power to lay out, locate, maintain, and
enjoy a continuous railroad and telegraph from a named point
in what was then the Territory of Nebraska to the western
boundary of what at that time was the Territory of Nevada.
That company was given the right of way through the public lands for the construction of its railroad and telegraph line
as well as the power and authority to take from those lands
adjacent to the line of the road, earth, stone and timber, and
other materials required in the work of construction, and so
far as it was necessary to' do so, to occupy the public lands, for
stations, buildings, workshops and depots, machine shops,
switches, side tracks, turntables and water stations; the
United States to extinguish the Indian titles to all lands falling under the operation of the act and required for the right
of way and grants made. "For the purpose of aiding in the
construction of said railroad and telegraph line, and to secure
the safe and speedy transportation of the mails, troops, munitions of war and public stores," a large grant of lands was
made, for which patents were directed to be issued as each
forty consecutive miles of railroad and telegraph were completed and equipped in all respects as required. §§ 2, 3, 4.
The fifth section provided that for the purposes mentioned

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the completion and equipment of forty consecutive miles of railroad and telegraph,
should issue to the company bonds of the United States, of
one thousand dollars each, payable in thirty years after date,
bearing six per centum per annum interest, to the amount of
sixteen of said bonds per mile for such section of forty miles;
and "to secure the repayment to the United States, as herein-

after provided, of the amount of said bonds so issued and
delivered to said company, together with all interest, thereon
which shall have been paid by the United States, the issue of
said bonds and delivery to the company shall ipsofacto constitute a mortgage on the whole line of the railroadand telegraph,
together with the rolling stock, flxtures and proverty of every
kind anddescription, and in considerationof which said bonds

may be issued; and on the refusal or failure of said company
to redeem said bonds, or any part of them, when required so
to do by the Secretary of the Treasury, in accordance with the
provisions of this act, the said road, with all the rights,functions, immunities and appurtenances thereunto belonging, and
also all lands granted to the said company, by the United States,
which, at the time of said default shall remain in the ownership of said company, may be taken possession of by the Secretary of the Treasury for the use and beneft of the United
States."

The grants referred to were made "upon condition that said
company shall pay said bonds at maturity, and shall keep said
railroad and telegraph line in repair and use, and shall at all
times transmit dispatches over said telegraph line, ana transport mails, troops and munitions of war, supplies and public
stores upon said railroad for the government whenever required to do so by any department thereof, and that the government shall at all times have the preference in the use of
the same for all the purposes aforesaid, (at fair and reasonable
rates of compensation, not to exceed the amounts paid by
private parties for the same kind of service;) and cll compensatio for services renderedfor the government shall be applied
to the payment of said bonds and interest until the whole
amount is fully paid." The company was entitled to pay

Opinion of the Court.

the United States, wholly or in part, in the same or other
bonds, treasury notes or other evidences of debt against the
United States, to be allowed at par; and after the road was
completed, until the bonds and interest were paid, at leastfive
per centum of the net earningsof said road were required to
be dnnually applied to the payment thereof. § 6.
The company was required to file its assent to the act in
the Department of the Interior within one year after its passage, and it was allowed until the 1st day of July, 1874, to
complete its railroad and telegraph through the Territories of
the United States, to the western boundary of the Territory
of Nevada, "there to meet and connect with the line of the
Central Pacific Railroad Company of California." §§ 7, 8.
The ninth section authorized the Leavenworth, Pawnee and
Western Railroad Company of Kansas to construct a railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri River, at the mouth of
the Kansas River, "upon the"same terms and conditions in all
respects" as were provided in the act for the construction of
the railroad and telegraph line first mentioned, and to meet
and connect with the same at the meridian of longitude named;
the route in Kansas, west of the meridian of Fort Riley, to
the aforesaid point, on the one hundredth meridian of longitude, to be subject to the approval of the President of
the United States, and to be determined by him on actual
survey. By the same section it was declared that "the
Central Pacific Railroad Company of California, a corporation
existing under the laws of the State of California, are hereby
authorized to construct a railroad and telegraph line from the
Pacific coast, at or near San Francisco, or the navigable, waters
of the Sacramento River, to the eastern boundary of California,
upon the same terms and conditions, in all reTpects, as are contained in this act for the construction of said railroad and
telegraph line first mentioned, and to meet and connect with
the first mentioned railroad and telegraph line on the eastern
boundary of California. Each of said companies shall file
their acceptance of the conditions of this act in the Department of the Interior within six months after the passage of
this act."
VOL. cLixx-27

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

The tenth section provided that the company chartered by
the State of Kansas should complete one hundred miles of its
road, commencing at the mouth of the Kansas River, within
two years after filing its assent to the conditions of the act, and
one hundred miles per year thereafter until the whole was completed; and the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California should complete fifty miles of its road within two years
after filing its assent to the provision of the act, and fifty miles
per year thereafter until the whole was completed; and "after
completing their roads, respectively, said companies, or either
of them, may unite upon equal terms with the first named
company in constructing so much of said railroad and telegraph line and branch railroads and telegraph lines in this
act hereinafter mentioned, through the Territories from the
State of Californiato the -MissouriRiver, as shall then remain
to be constructed, on the same terms and conditions as provided
in this act in relation to the said Union Pacific Railroad
Company." And the Central Pacific Railroad Company of
California, after completing its road across that State, was
authorized "to continue the construction of said railroad and
telegraph through the Territories qf the United States to the
-MissouriRiver, including the branch roads specified in this
act, upon the routes hereinbefore and hereinafter indicated,
on the terms and conditions provided in this act in relation to
the said Union Pacific Railroad Company, until said roads
shall meet and connect, and the whole of said railroad and
branches and telegraph is completed."
By the twelfth section it was declared that the "tra c k upon
the entire line of railroad and branches shall be of uniform
width, to be determined by the President of the United States,
so that, when completed, cars can be run from the -Missouri
River to the Pacific coast; the grades and curves shall not
exceed the maximum grades and curves of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad; the whole line of said railroad and branches
and telegraph shall be operated and used for all purposes of
communication, travel and transportation so far as the public
and government are concerned, as one connected, continuous
line. .

UNITED STATES v. STANFORD.
Opinion of the Court.

The fifteenth section gave to any other railroad company
then or thereafter incorporated the right to connect with the
road and branches provided for by the act, at such places and
upon such just and equitable terms as the President of the
United States should prescribe.
All of the railroad companies named in the act, and assenting
thereto, or any two or more of them, were authorized to form
themselves into one consolidated company; notice of such
consolidation to be in writing, to be filed in the Department
of the Interior, and the consolidated company to proceed to
construct the railroad, branches and telegraph line, upon the
terms and conditions provided in the act. § 16.
The seventeenth section provided: "That in case said
company or companies shall fail to comply with the terms and
conditions of this act, by not completing said railroad and
telegraph and branches within a reasonable time, or by not
keeping the same in repair and use, but shall permit the same,
for an unreasonable time, to remain unfinished, or out of repair, and unfit for use, Congress may pass any act to insure
the speedy completion of said road and branches, or put the
same in repair and use, and may direct the income of said
railroad and telegraph line to be thereafter devoted to the use
of the United States, to repay all such expenditures caused by
the default and neglect of said company or companies: Provided, That if said roads are not completed, so as to form a
continuous line of railroad,ready for use, from the .Missouri
River to the navigablewaters of the Sacramento River, in (alifornia,by the first day of July, 1876, the whole of all of said
railroads before mentioned and to be constructed under the
provisions of this act, together with all their furnishings, fixtures, rolling stock, machine shops, lands, tenements and
hereditaments, and property of every kind and character,
shall be forfeited to and be taken -possessionof by the United
States: Provided,That of the bonds of the United States in
this act provided to be delivered for any and all parts of the
roads to be constructed east of the one hundredth meridian of
west longitude from Greenwich, and for any part of the road
west of the west foot of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, there

Opinion of the Court.

shall be reserved of each part and instalment twenty-five per
centur, to be and remain in the United States Treasury undelivered, until said roads and all "partsthereof *providedfor in
this act are entirely completd; and of all the bonds provided

to be delivered for the said road, between the two points aforesaid, there shall be reserved out of each instalment fifteen per
centum, to be and to remain in the Treasury until the whole

of the road provided for in this act is fully completed; and if
the said road or any part thereof shall fail of completion at
the time limited therefor in this act, then and in that case the
said part of said bonds so reserved shall be forfeited to the
United States."
By the eighteenth section it was declared: "Whenever it
appears that the net earnings of the entire road and telegraph,

including the amount allowed for services rendered for the
United States, after deducting all expenditures, including
repairs and the furnishing, running and managing of said
road, shall exceed ten per centum upon its costs, exclusive
of the five per centur, to be paid to the United States, Congress may reduce the rates of fare thereon if unreasonable in
amount, and may fix and establish the same by law. And
the better to accomplish the object of this act, namely, to promote the public interest and welfare by the construction of
said railroad and telegraph line, and keeping the same in
working order, and to secure to the government at all times
(but particularly in time of war) the use and benefits of the
same for postal, military and other purposes, Congress may,
at any time, having due regard for the rights of said companies named herein, add to, alter, amend or repeal this act."
The several railroad companies named were authorized
to enter into an arrangement with the Pacific Telegraph
Company, the Overland Telegraph Company, and the California State Telegraph Company, "so that the present line
of telegraph between the Xissouri River and San Francisco

may be moved upon or along the line of said railroad and
branches as fast as said roads and branches are built; and if
said arrangement be entered into and the transfer of said telegraph line be made in accordance therewith to the line of said

UNITED STATES v. STANFORD.
Opinion of the Court.

railroad and branches, such transfer shall, for all purposes of
this act, be held and considered a fulfilment on the part of
said railroad companies of the provisions of this act in regard
to the construction of said line of telegraph. And, in case
of disagreement said telegraph companies are authorized to
remove their line of telegraph along and upon the line of railroad herein contemplated without prejudice to the rights of
the railroad companies named herein." § 19.
The act of 1862 was amended in many particulars by the act
of July 2, 1864, c. 216, 13 Stat. 356. The time for designating
the general route of the Union Pacific Railroad, and of filing
the map of the same, and the time for the completion of that
part of the railroads required by the terms of said act of each
company, was extended one year from the time designated in
the act of 1862; and the Central Pacific Railroad Company
of California was required to complete twenty-five miles of
its road "in each year thereafter, and the whole to the state
line within four years, and that only one half of the compensation for services rendered for the government by said companies shall be required to be applied to the payment of the
bonds issued by the government in aid of the construction of
said roads." § 5.
The proviso to section four of the original act was modified
so that the President of the United States was authorized to
appointfor each of the Toads three commissioners, as provided
for in the original act; and "the verified statement of the
president of the California company, required by said section
four, shall be filed in the office of the United States surveyor
general for the State of California, instead of being presented
to the President of the United States; and the said surveyor
general shall thereupon notify the said commissioners of the
filing of such statement, and the said commissioners shall thereupon proceed to examine the portion of said railroad and telegraph line so completed, and make their report thereon to the
President of the United States, as provided by the act of which
this is amendatory. And such statement may be filed, and
such railroad and telegraph line be examined and reported on,
by the said commissioners, and the requisite amount of bonds

OCTOBER TERM, 1895.
Opinion of the Court.

may be issued and the lands appertaining thereto may be set
apart, located, entered and patented, as provided in this act
and the act to which this is amendatory, upon the construction by said railroad company of California of any portion of
not less than twenty consecutive miles of their said railroad
and telegraph line, upon the certificate of said commissioners
that such portion is completed as required by the act to which
this is amendatory." § 6.
So much of section 17 of the act of 1862 as provided for a
reservation by the government of a portion of the bonds to
be issued to aid in the construction of the said railroads was
repealed; and it was provided that the failure of any one
company to comply fully with the conditions and requirements of that act, and the act of which it was amendatory,
should not work a forfeiture of the rights, privileges, or franchise of any other company or companies that should have
complied with the same. § 7.
To enable any one of the corporations to make convenient
and necessary connections with other roads, it was authorized
to establish and maintain all necessary ferries upon and across
all rivers which its road might pass in its course; and authority was given each corporation to construct over all rivers for
the convenience of such road bridges having suitable and
proper draws for the passage of steamboats.
The tenth section provided: "That section five of said act
be so modified and amended that the Union Pacific Railroad
Company, the Central Pacific Railroad Company, and any
other company authorized to yarticipatein the construction of
said road,may, on the completion of each section of said road,
as provided in this act and the act to which this is an amendment, issue their first mortgage bonds on their respective railroad and telegraph lines to an amount not exceeding the
amount of the bonds of the United States, and of even tenor
and date, time of maturity, rate and character of interest with
the bonds authorized to be issued to said railroad companies
respectively. And the lien of the United States bonds shall
be subordinate to that of the bonds of any or either of said
companies hereby authorized to be issued on their respective

UNITED STATES v. STAN-FORD.
Opinion of the Court.

roads, property and equipments, except as to the provisions of
the sixth section of the act to which this act is an amendment,
relating to the transmission of dispatches and the transportation of mails, troops, munitions of war, supplies and public
stores for the government of the United States. And said
section is further amended by striking out the word 'forty,'
and inserting in lieu thereof the words 'on each and every
section of not less than twenty.'"
By the eleventh section it was declared that "if any of the
railroad -companies entitled to bonds of the United .States, or
to issue their first mortgage bonds herein provided for, has, at
the time of the approval of this .act, issued, or shall thereafter
issue, any of its own bonds or securities in such form or manner as in law or equity to entitle the same to priority of preference of payment to the said guaranteed bonds or said first
mortgage bonds, the amount of such corporate bonds outstanding and unsatisfied, or uncancelled, shall be deducted from the
amount of such government and first mortgage bonds which
the company may be entitled to receive and issue; and such
an amount only of such government bonds and such first
mortgage bonds shall be granted or permitted, as, added to
such outstanding, unsatisfied or uncancelled bonds of the
company shall make up the whole amount per mile to which
the company would otherwise have been entitled . ..
Provid-ed, also, That no land granted by this act shall be conveyed to any party or parties, and no bonds shall be issued
to any company or companies, party or parties, on account of
any road, or part thereof, made prior to the passage of the
act to which this act is an amendment, or made subsequent
thereto, under the provisions of any act or acts other than
this act and the act amended by this act."
The twelfth section provided that the Leavenworth, Pawnee
and Western Railroad Company, now known as the Union
Pacific Railroad Company, Eastern Divisionf-should build the
railroad from the mouth of Kansas River, by the way of
Leavenworth,. or, if that be not deemed the best route, then
it should, within two years, build a railroad from the city of
Leavenworth to unite with the main stem ator near the city

of Lawrence; but to aid in the construction of said branch
the company was to receive no bonds. And if the Union
Pacific Railroad Company should not be proceeding in good
faith to build its railroad through the territories, when the
Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western Railroad Company, or
the Union Pacific Railroad Company, Eastern Division, shall
have completed its road to the hundredth degree of longitude, then the last named company may proceed to make said
road westward "until it meets and connects with the Central
Pacific Railroad Company on the same line."
The fifteenth section required the several companies, authorized to construct the aforesaid roads, to operate and use
said roads and telegraph for all purposes of communication,
travel and transportation, so far as the public and government
were concerned, "as one continuous line; and in such operation and use to afford and secure to each equal advantages
and facilities as to rates, time and transportation, without any
discrimination of any kind in favor of the road or business
of either or any of said companies, or adverse to the road or
business of any or either of the others."
Any two or more of the companies authorized to participate
in the benefits of the act were authorized, at any time, to unite
and consolidate their organizations "upon such terms and conditions and in such manner as they may agree upon, and as
shall not be incompatible with this act or the laws of the
States in which the roads of such companies may be," and
thereupon such organization, so formed and consolidated,
"shall succeed to, possess and be entitled to receive from
the government of the United States all and singular the
grants, benefits, immunities, guarantees, acts and things to be
done and performed, and -be subject to the same terms, conditions, restrictions and requirements which said companies,
respectively, at the time of such consolidation, are or may be
entitled or subject to under this act, in place and substitution
of said companies so consolidated respectively." § 16.
All the provisions of this act so far as applicable, relating
or in any manner appertaining to the companies so consolidated, or either thereof, were to apply to the consolidated

UNITED STATES v. STANFORD.
Opinion of the Court.

organization. And if, upon the completion by the consolidated organization of the roads, or either of them, of the
companies consolidated, any other of the road or roads of
either of the other companies authorized and forming, or
intended or necessary to form, a portion of "a continuous
line" from each of the several designated points on the
Missouri River to the Pacific coast shall not have constructed
the number of miles of its road within the time required,
the consolidated organization was authorized "to continue the
construction of its road and telegraph in th6 general direction
and route upon which such incomplete or unconstructed road
is hereinbefore authorized to be built, until such continuation
of the road of such consolidated organization shall reach the
constructed road and telegraph of said other company and
at such point to connect and unite therewith; and for and in
aid thereof the said consolidated organization may do and
perform, in reference to such portion of road and telegraph
as shall so be in continuation of its constructed road and telegraph, and to the construction and equipment thereof, all and
singular the several acts and things provided, authorized or
granted to be done by the company authorized to construct
and equip the same," and shall be entitled to "similar and
like grants,benefts, immunities, guarantees,acts and things to
be done and performed by the government of the United
States, by the President of the United States, or the Secretaries of the Treasury and Interior, and by commissioners in
reference to such company, and to such portion of the road
hereinbefore authorized to be constructed by it, and upon the
like and similar terms and conditions, as far as the same are
applicable thereto." "And in case any company authorized
thereto shall not enter into any consolidated organization,
such company, upon the completion of the road as hereinbefore provided, shall be entitled to, and is hereby authorized
to, continue and extend the same under the circumstances, and
in accordance with the provisions in this section, and to have
all the benefits thereof,as fully and completely as are herein
.rovided, touching such- consolidated organization. And in
case more than one such consolidated organization shall be

made, pursuant to this act, the terms and conditions of this
act, hereinbefore recited as to one, shall apply in like manner,
force and effect to the other: Provided,however, That rights
and interests at any time acquired by one such consolidated
organization shall not be impaired by another thereof." It
was further provided that "should the Central Pacific Railroad Company of ealifornia complete their line to the eastern
line of the State of California, before the line of the Union
Pacific Railroad Company shall have been extended westward so as to meet the line of said first named company, said
first named company may extend their line of road eastward
one hundred and fifty miles on the established route, so as to
meet and connect with the line of the Union Pacific road,
complying in all respects with the provisions and restrictions
of this act as to said Union Pacific road, and upon doing so
shall enjoy all the rights,privileges and benefits conferred by
this act on said Union,Pacific Railroad Company." § 16.
By a subsequent act, approved M[arch 3, 1865, c. 88, the
tenth section of the act of 1864 was so amended as to allow
the Central Pacific Railroad Company, and the Western
Pacific Railroad Company of California, the Union Pacific
Railroad Company, the Union Pacific Railroad Company,
Eastern Division, and all other companies provided for in the
above act, to issue their six per centum thirty years bonds,
to the extent of one hundred miles in advance of a continuous, completed line of construction; further, that the assignment made by the Central Pacific Railroad Company of
California to the Western Pacific Railroad Company of said
State, of the right to construct all that portion of said railroad and telegraph from thi city of San Jos6 to Sacramento,
was ratified and confirmed to the latter company, "with all
the privileges and benefits of the several acts of Congress relat13
ing thereto and subject to all the conditions thereof."
Stat. 504.
.From this review of the legislation of Congress it appears
that the acts of 1862, 1864, and 1865 all relate to the same
general subject; and, when examined for the purpose of
ascertaining the object of Congress in passing them, they

UNITED STATES v. STANFORD.
Opinion of the Court.

should be regarded as one enactment. What that object was
is no longer a subject of inquiry in this court. In United
States v. Union Pacflc Railroad Company, 91 U. S. 92, this
court, speaking by Mr. Justice Davis, held that the construction of a railroad connecting the Missouri River with the
Pacific Ocean was a national work, because such a road would
be a great national highway, under national control; that the
scheme for establishing that highway originated in national
necessities, the country being involved at the-time in a civil
war which threatened the disruption of the Union, and endangered the safety of our possessions on the Pacific; and that
the enterprise required national assistance, because private
capital was inadequate for an undertaking of such magnitude.
It appears upon the face of the act of 1862, as amended by
the act of 1864, that Congress had in view the promotion of
the public interest and welfare by the construction of a railroad and telegraph line that could be used by the government
at all times, but particularly in time of war, for postal, military, and other purposes, and that so far as the government
and the public were concerned, such road and telegraph were
to be operated as one continuous line. These ends were to be
attained through the agency of a corporation created by Congress, and of certain corporations organized under state laws
which Congress selected as instruments to be employed in
accomplishing the public objects specified in its legislation.
Naturally, the next inquiry is, whether Congress made any
and if any what provision to secure the United States against
liability on account of its bonds issued in aid of the construction of this national highway? The acts of 1862 and-1864
furnish the answer to this question. By the act of 1862, as
we have seen, it is provided that the issuing of bonds and
their delivery to. the railroad company entitled to receive
them should ipso facto constitute a mortgage on the whole
line of the railroad and telegraph constructed by the company
receiving the bonds, together with its rolling stock, fixtures
and property of every kind and description, and in consideration of which the bonds were issued ; and upon the refusal or
failure of the company to redeem the bonds, or any part of

them, when required so to do by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with the act, the railroad, with all the
rights, functions, immunities and appurtenances appertaining
thereto, and all lands granted to the company, could be
taken possession of by that officer, for the use and benefit of
the United States. The same act also authorized the government to retain all sums due as compensation for services rendered in its behalf by the railroad company.
These provisions were so far altered by the act of 186. as
to authorize the Union Pacific Railroad Company, or any
company authorized to participate in the construction of the
road from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, to place a
first mortgage on their railroad and telegraph lines, respectively, (to an amount not exceeding the bonds of the United
States,) to which mortgage the lien of the United States bonds
was made subordinate -saving the right of the government,
reserved in the act of 1862, to be preferred in the use of the
railroad and telegraph for the transportation of the mails,
troops and munitions of war, and the transmission of telegraphic dispatches. The act of 1864 also provided that only
one half of the compensation due from the government for
services rendered should be retained and applied to the payment of the bonds issued by the United States. But the act
of May 7, 1878, c. 96, § 2, known as the Thurman Act, 20
Stat. 56, provided that the whole of such compensation might
be retained, one half to be applied to the payment of interest
-on the bonds issued by the United States, and the other half
to be turned into the sinking fund established by that act.
These and other provisions indicate the extent to which
Congress deemed it necessary to make provision for the protection of the United States against liability on its bonds
loaned to railroad companies for the purposes indicated in
the act of 1862. The security taken by the government was,
of course, impaired by the act of 1861, which subordinated
the lien: of the United States, as originally declared, to the
first mortgages executed by the respective companies under
the authority of that act. But if the act of 1862, fairly interpreted, excludes the idea that stockholders of the companies

receiving subsidy bonds were to be personally liable to the
United States for the principal and interest accruing on those
bonds, the legislation of 1864, however unwise, did not have
the effect of imposing such liability.
Now the important fact disclosed by the Pacific Railroad
acts is that no one of them contains any clause imposing
upon the stockholders of a corporation receiving subsidy
bonds personal responsibility for any debt due to the United
States from such corporation by reason of its failure to pay
those bonds at maturity. It was, of course, competent for
Congress, when incorporating the Union Pacific Railroad
Company, to impose such liability upon the stockholders of
that corporation. But as it did not do so; as the personal
liability of stockholders for the debts of the corporation arises
only from statute, it cannot be claimed, nor is it claimed, that
the stockholders of that corporation incurred by their subscriptions of stock any liability to the United States, or to any other
creditor for the debts of that company; they were bound, of
course, to make good the amount of their subscriptions; but
that being done, their personal responsibility to creditors of
the corporate body ceased. Pollardv. Bailey, 20 Wall. 520,

Congress, by its legislation, encouraged and invited the investment of private capital in the copstruction of a highway
which, at that time, was deemed of vital importance to the
whole country. As the stockholder of a corporation is not
liable, beyond the amount of his unpaid subscription, for its
debts, unless such liability is imposed by statute, and. as the
acts of Congress in question are silent upon that subject,
every subscriber to the stbck of the Union Pacific Railroad
Company must be deemed to have become such upon the con-

dition, implied by law, that he should not be personally liable
for the debts of the corporation. It is not too much to say
that if the acts of 1862 and 1861 had made the stockholders
.of the corporations therein named personally liable, in proportion to their stock, for the repayment of the principal
and interest of the bonds issued and delivered to such corporation, the accomplishing of the objects Congress had in view
would have been seriously retarded, if not wholly defeated.
It is said, however, that these principles have no application
to stockholders of California corporations that came into existence under constitutional and statutory provisions making a
stockholder of a railroad corporation liable, in proportion to
his stock, for its debts and obligations.
This position cannot be sustained except upon the theory
that Congress intended to take a larger security in respect of
that part of the Pacific road which the California company
undertook to construct and maintain, than it took in respect
of the Union Pacific railroad. But it cannot be inferred from
the legislation of Congress that it intended, for the protection
of the interests of the United States, to impose a heavier liability upon the stockholders of the California company than
was imposed upon the stockholders of the- Union Pacific
Railroad Company. Why should it have so intended? Why
should it be supposed that Congress would purposely make it
more difficult to construct one part of the proposed national
highway than another? The supreme -end sought to be attained was, by means of private capital and governmental
aid, to secure the construction of the whole line for the benefit, primarily, of the United States, and for the use of all the
people. If, instead of making use of the Central Pacific
Railroad Company of California, Congress had itself created
a corporation with authority to construct a road from San
Francisco through the Territories of the United States, to
meet the Union Pacific Railroad Company, no one would suggest that the stockholders of such a corporation would have
been liable for its debts, unless Congress expressly imposed
liability upon them. In respect of the liability of stockholders to the United States, on account of its subsidy bonds,

Opinion of the Court.

we cannot believe that Congress intended to apply to the
stockholders of the state corporation, selected to participate
in the great work of establishing railroad and telegraphic
communication between the Missouri River and the Pacific
Ocean, any rule that it did not prescribe for stockholders of a
national corporation created for the purpose of accomplishing
the same object.
As Congress contemplated the construction of one connected, continuous line from the Missouri Rivet to the Pacific
Ocean to be used for governmental and public purposes; as
it recognized "the necessity of uniting, by iron bands, the
destiny of the Pacific and Atlantic States;" as its enactments
disclose an intention to grant national aid to the corporations
named, upon terms and conditions applicable alike to all of
them, we cannot impute to it the purpose to make a discrimination against one part of that line that would necessarily
have retarded the. accomplishment of the important public
object which it had in view. Throughout the whole of the
acts referred to is manifest the purpose that the California
corporation, and other state corporations named, should enjoy the rights, immunities, benefits, and privileges given to
them, upon the same terms and conditions as were prescribed
for the Union Pacific Railroad Company. But the imposition
of liability upon the stockholders of the California corporation for the debt of that corporation arising out of the bonds
it received from the United States, when no such liability was
imposed upon the stockholders of the Union Pacific Railroad
corporation on account of like bonds received by it, would be
inconsistent with that equality in terms and conditions which
Congress prescribed for the corporations that were invited or
permitted to participate in the grants, rights, benefits, privileges and immunities granted by the general government to
the corporation created by it.
It should be remembered that the question here is not
whether the stockholders of the California company can be
made liable for its debts to the United States arising in some
other way than under the Pacific Railroad Acts and by the
acceptance of United States bonds in aid of the construction

of its road. Nor are we now to decide whether the adoption
of the California corporation as an instrument of the national
government in accomplishing a national object exempted its
stockholders from liability under the constitution and laws of
California to ordinary creditors. The question before us relates only to the liability of the stockholders of the California
corporation on account of a claim of the United States arising
out of particular acts of Congress which authorized the issuing and delivery of bonds to that corporation, and made such
provision for the security of the United States as Congress
deemed necessary and proper, but which did not reserve any
right to look to the stockholders of that corporation if it
failed or refused to meet the obligation imposed upon it in
respect of those bonds.
Touching the obligation of the several railroad companies
to pay at maturity the bonds received from the United States
ihi aid of the construction of a railroad and telegraph line to
the Pacific Ocean, there are cogent reasons, apart from the
words of the act of Congress, why a rule should not be
applied to the stockholders of the Central Pacific Railroad
Company which confessedly cannot be applied to 'stockholders
of ihe Union Pacific Railroad Company. Both corporations
participated in the execution of the purposes of Congress.
Each received franchises and powers from the Federal government to be exerted for objects of national concern. Although
the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California became
an artificial being, under the laws of that State, its road owes
its existence to the national government; for, all that was
accomplished by the corporation that constructed and owns it
was accomplished in the exercise of privileges granted by, and
because of the aid derived from, the United States. "By the
act-of 1862," this court has said, "Congress granted this corporation a right to build a road from San Francisco, or the
navigable waters of the Sacramento River, to the eastern
boundary of the State and thence through the Territories of
the United States, until it met the road of the Union Pacific
Company. For this purpose all the rights, privileges and
franchises were given this company that were granted the

UNITED STATES v. STANFORD.
Opinion of the Court.

Union Pacific Company, except the franchise of being a corporation, and such others as were merely incident to the
organization of the company. The land grants and subsidy
bonds to this company were the same in character and quantity as those to the Union Pacific, and the same right of
amendment was reserved. Each of the companies was
required to file in the Department of the Interior its acceptance of the conditions imposed before it could become entitled
to the benefits conferred by the act. This was promptly done
by the Central Pacific Company, and in this way that corporation voluntarily submitted itself to such legislative control by
Congress as was reserved under the power of amendment."
Again, in the same case: "But for the corporate powers and
financial aid granted by Congress it is not probable that the
road would have been built." Sinking Fund cases, 99 U. S.
700, 727. And in California v. Pacif Rail'oad Compvany,
127 U. S. 1, 38, Mr. Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion of
the court, referred to the Pacific Railroad Acts, relating to the
Central Pacific Railroad, and said: 1 Thus, without referring
to the other franchises and privileges conferred upon this company, the fundamental franchise was given by the acts of
1862 and the subsequent acts to construct a railroad froni the
Pacific Ocean across the State of California and the Federal,.
Territories until it should meet the Union Pacific, which it
did meet at Ogden in the Territory of Utah." The relations
between the California corporation and the State were of no
concern to the national government at the time the purpose
was formed to establish a gTeat highway across the continent
for governmental and public use. Congress chose this existing artificial being as an instrumentality to accomplish
national ends, and the relations between the United States
and that corporation ought to be determined by the enactments which established those relations; and if those enactments do not expressly nor by implication subject the stockholders of such corporation to liability for its debts, it is to be
presumed that Congress intended to waive its right to impose
any such liability.
The views we have expressed render it unnecessary to convoL. cim-28
