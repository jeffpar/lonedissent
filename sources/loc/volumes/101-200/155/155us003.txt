JUSTICE JACKSON,

dissenting.

I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court in this
case. I notice, as a preliminary matter, a practice which I
think is not to be commended and ought not to be pursued.
The application to punish the three appellees was denied by
the Circuit Court. The reason given for the decision was the
unconstitutionality of that portion of the interstate commerce
act which requires a court to tieat and punish as a contempt
of its authority the refusal of a witness before the commission
to answer questions. In the opinion this court,considers that
reason, holds it unsound, and remands the case for further
proceedings. On such further proceedings the Circuit Court
may, without disobedience bf the mandate, again deny the
application, for the further reason that the questions propounded by the commission to the witnesses are deemed irrelevant or incompetent; and on a second appeal it may be that
this court will also be of the same opinion; and then this curi-

ous result will appear: Of two successive judgments in the
same case, each denying the same application, this court sustains one and reverses the other. I had supposed the rule
was settled that the inquiry in this court was simply whether
that which was adjudged by the trial court was erroneous,
and not whether the reasons given therefor were good or bad,
and that a correct judgment was always sustained, even if the
reasons given therefor were erroneous. But this is a minor
matter, and I only notice it to express my dissent from the
practice.
I pass, therefore, to the important question considered by
the court in its opinion. With the bulk of that opinion I
have no disposition to quarrel. I agree as to the power of the
United States over interstate commerce, but that throws no
more light on the real question involved herein than an inquiry
into the power of Congress to enact laws would upon the question determined in Ifilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U. S. 168, of
the right of the House of Representatives to punish as for
contempt one who refused to disclose the business of a real
estate partnership of which he was a member. The power of
Congress to use all reasonable and proper means for exercising
its control over interstate commerce carries with it no right
to break down the barriers between judicial and administrative
duties, or to make courts the mere agents to assist an administrative body in the prosecution of its inquiries. For, if the
power exists, as is affirmed by this decision, it carries with it
the power to make courts the mere assistants of every adininistrative board or executive officer in the pursuit of any information desired or in the execution of any duties imposed. It
informs Congress that tl only mistake it made in the libourn case was in itself attempting to punish for contempt,
and that hereafter the same result can be accomplished by an
act requiring the courts to punish for contempt those who
refuse to answer questions put by either House, or any committee thereof.
It must be borne in mind that this is purely and solely a
proceeding for contempt. No action is pending in the court
to enforce a right or redress a wrong, public or private. No

inquiry is being carried, on in it with a view to the punishment
of crime, noting. sought to be'done for the perpetuation of
testimony or in aid of any judicial proceeding., The delinquent is punished for a contempt of court in refusing to testify
before a commission in aid of an investigation carried on by
such commission. What is this power vested -in courts of
punishment for contempt, and for what purpose is it vested?
It is a power of summary punishment and existing to enable
the courts to discharge their judicial, duties. "Contempt of
court is a specific criminal offence." . tew Orleans v. Steamship Company, 20 Wall. 387, 392. In Anderson v. Dunn,
6 Wheat. 204, 227, it was said that "courts of justice are
universally acknowledged to be vested, by their very creation,
with power to impose silence, respect, and decorum in their
presence and submission to their lawful mandates." So in
LEw parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 510: "The power to punish for contempts is inherent in all courts; its existence is
essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings,
and to the enforcement of the judgments, orders, andwrits of
the courts, and consequently to the due administration of justice. The moment the courts of the United States were called
into existence and invested with jurisdiction over any subject,
they became possessed of this power." And in Cooper's Case,
32 Vermont, 253, 257: f"The power to punish for contempt
is inherent in the nature and constitution of a court. It is a
power not derived from. any statute, but arising from necessity,;
implied because it is necessary to the exercise of all other
powers."
A contempt presupposes som act derogatory to the power
and authority of the court. But before 'this proceeding was
initiated the only authority disregarded. was that of the com,mission. The court treats such act derogatory to the powers
of the commission as derogatory to its own, and punishes, as
for a contempt of its own authority, one who disobeys the
order of the commission. It is no sound answer to say that
the court orders the witness to testify and punishes for disobedience of that order. The real wrong is in not testifying
before the commission, and that is the ground of the punish-

ment. Otherwise any disregard of any duty can be treated
as a contempt of court and punished as such. It will be sufficient to cite the delinquent and order his punishment as for
a contempt of court unless he discharges that duty. His failure to obey the order of the court is only the nominal, while
the failure to discharge the prior duty is the real, ground of
punishment. No forms of statement can change the substantial fact that the inherent power of courts to punish for contempt is exercised, not to preserve the authority of the court,
not in aid of proceedings carried on in them, but to aid a
merely administrative body, and to compel obedience to its
requirements. It makes the courts the mere assistants of a
commission.
It is said that this proceeding is substantially, if not precisely, similar to that which would arise if Congress had passed
an act imposing penalties on parties refusing to testify before
a commission and a proceeding was commenced to recover
such penalties. But surely the differences are vital. If such
proceeding were a criminal prosecution, defendants would have
the constitutional guarantee of a trial by jury, and this, too,
in an action at law if the amount of the penalty exceeded $20.
By making it a proceeding for contempt, these constitutional
protections are evaded. Further, there is no penalty prescribed. Refusal to answer is not made an offence, misdemeanor, or felony.
Suppose a law was enacted .making criminal the refusal to
answer -questions put by a commission, (and a statute would
be necessary before such refusal could be adjudged ciiminal,
for there are no common law offences against the United
States - United States v. Eaton, 144 U. S. 677,) would it not
be necessary that the statute define the questions, or at least
the scope of the questions to be asked? Would not an act be
void for indefiniteness and lack of certainty which simply
made criminal the refusal to answer relevant questions in any
proper investigation carried on before a commission? Would
it not be like the famous Chinese statute:
"Whoever is guilty of improper conduct, and of such as is
contrary to the spirit of the laws, though not a breach of any

INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMM. v. BRIMSON.

t

specific part of it, shall be punished with at least forty blows;
and when the impropriety is of a serious nature, with eighty
bloWs."

Could it be left to the commission to select the matter of
investigation, determine the scope of the inquiry, and thus, as
it were, create the crime?
Can all these difficulties be avoided by bringing the refusal
to testify, before a commission within the reach of the comprehensive inherent power' of the courts to preserve their author-

ity by proceedings for contempt?
But again, it is said that the act of Congress imposes upon
all persons and corporations engaged in interstate commerce a
duty to answer every proper question which the commission
may see fit to ask, and that a refusal to answer constitutes a
refusal to discharge a duty'upon rightful demand. It is true
that authority is conferred upon the commission to obtain information, but the act does not impose the duty to furnish it
upon all persons interested in interstate commerce; and Congress cannot invest the commission with discretionary power
to create or not create a duty. If, when a question is asked,
a duty is established, then the court would have no power to
do anything except to enforce the act of the commission,. if
valid, or punish its violation without inquiry, which, as has
been stated, would make the court the mere ministerial agent
of the commission. If the duty is not established, then the
court is called 'upon to take part in a mere inquiry as to
whether it would be lawful or expedient, that the duty be
established. It is not pretended that the court can take cognizance of the whole investigation on petition, and this application is not a part of any judicial proceeding, nor could the
order adjudicate anything. It is clear that the duty, if it
exists at all, is a political and not a judicial duty. Would
mandamus lie to compel the discharge of this duty? Yet
mandamus is the recognized proceeding for the enforcement
-of a duty.
It may be that it is the duty of every citizen to give information to the commission when demanded,,but it is no more
a duty than it is to avoid murder or other crimes; to lead a

OCTOBER TERM, 1893:

life of social purity; to avoid fraud in business transactions,
or neglect of other duties of good citizenship. Will it be pretended that these obligations can be enforced by the courts
through proceedings as for contempt?
To say that there is a case, something that calls for judicial
action, because there are parties on the one side or on the
other, is a breadth of definition hitherto unrecognized. Every
effort at administrative or executive action, which is not voluntarily assented to by those whom it affects, creates a dispute
between parties. Can it be that every such dispute justifies
hn appeal to the courts, and presents a case for judicial action?
If so, there is nothing which any administrative body or executive officer shall attempt to do which cannot be carried
into the courts, and every failure to comply with the orders
'of such body or officer makes the delinquent subject to
punishment by the process of contempt. Hitherto the power
to punish for contempt has been regarded as a power lodged
in judges and courts to compel obedience to their orders,
decrees, and judgments, and to support their authority.
This is something more important than a mere question of
the form of procedure. It goes to the essential differences
between judicial and legislative action. If this power of the
courts can be invoked to aid the inquiries of any administrative body, or enforce the orders of any executive officer, why
may not the power to punish for contempt be vested directly
in- the administrative board or in the executive officer? Why
call in the court to act as a mere tool? If the interstate
commerce commission can rightfully invoke the power of the
courts to punish as for contempt those who refuse to answer
their questions, why may not like power be given to any
prosecuting attorney, and he be authorized to summon witnesses, those for as well as those against the government,
and in advance compel them, through the agency of the courts,
to disclose all the evidence they can give on any expected
trial? If these appellees have committed crime, punishment
therefor comes only through the courts, and by the recognized
procedure of information or indictment. They cannot be
tried by the commission for any act done.

INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMM. v. BRIMSON.

Dissenting Opinion: Brewer, Jackson, JJ., Fuller, C. J.

One often-declared difference between judicial and legislative power is that the former determines the rightfulness of
acts done; the latter prescribes the rule for acts to be done.
The one construes what has been; the other determines what
shall be. As said in Cooley's Constitutional Limitations
(side page 92):
"In fine the law is apied by the one, and made by the
other. To do the first, therefore, -to compare the claims
of parties with the law of the land before established,- is in
its nature a judicial act. But to do the last-to pass new
rules for the regulation of new controversies -is in its nature
a legislative act ; and if these rules interfere with the past, or
the present, and do not look wholly to the future, they violate
the definition of a law as 'a rule of civil conduct;' because
no rule of conduct can with consistency operate upon what
occurred before the rule itself was promulgated."
So, for whatever the appellees have done in the past,
whether they have violated any law of the land or not,, an
inquiry is to be made in and by the courts. The judicial
power cannot be invoked to sustain an investigation into past
conduct which, when disclosed, may or may not be, at the will
of an administrative board or executive officer presented for
judicial consideration or action. It is not meant to be affirmed
that no inquiry can be made into past conduct or actions
except through the power and processes of the courts. On
the contrary, the full power of legislative or executive departments to inquire into what has been is conceded. But if
designed to aid legislative or executive action it must be by
legislative or executive proceedings. Can the courts be turned
into commissions of inquiry in aid of legislative action?
In short, and to sum it up in a word: If these appellees
have violated any law their punishment should be sought in
the ordinary way, by prosecution therefor in the courts. If
they have violated no law, and the simple purpose is to elicit
information for the guidance of the commission or the legislature, let that information be sought by the ordinary processes of legislative or administrative bodies.
Take a familiar illustration: Once in ten years a census is

ordered by authority of Congress, and the scope of that
census, constantly enlarged, is to elicit from the citizens of
the United -States information as to a variety of topics. No
thought of punishment for past misdeeds enters into such an
inquiry. Information, and that only, is sought. It is unquestionably the duty of every citizen to respond to the inquiries
made by the census officers and furnish the information desired. Can it be that courts can be authorized to make the
refusal of a citizen to furnish any siph desired information
a contempt of their authority and to be punished as such?
There is no question of the lawful power-of Congress to elicit
this information; possibly none as to its power to provide
that a refusal to give the information sball be deemed a misdemeanor and prosecuted and punished as such. But it seems
to me to obliterate all the historic distinction between judicial
and legislative or administrative proceedings to say that the
courts can be called upon to punish as for a contempt of their
authority a mere refusal to respond to this administrative
inquiry as to facts.
This question was fully considered by Mr. Justice Field,
while holding the Circuit Court, in In re Pacii Railroad
Commission, 32 Fed. Rep. 251, and the power of Congress
to make the courts the mere assistants of an investigating
committee was most emphatically denied.
