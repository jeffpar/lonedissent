AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROIE THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 89. Argued October 26, 1894. -Decided

December 17, 1894.

The act of March 3, 1883, c. 111, 22 Stat. 804, authorizing the Court of Claims
to hear and determine the claims of the successors and representatives
of Sterling T. Austin, deceased, for cotton alleged to have been taken
from him in Louisiana by the authorities of the United States in 1863, 1864,
and 1865, "any statute of limitation to the contrary notwithstanding,
.provided, however, that it be shown to the satisfaction of the court that
neither Sterling T. Austin, Senior, nor any of his surviving representatives, gave any aid or comfort to the late rebellion, but were throughout
the war loyal to the government of the United States," made the
establishment of loyalty in fact, as contradistinguished from innocence
in law produced by pardon, a-prerequisite to jurisdiction, and the Court
of Claims, having found that the claimant was not thus loyal, properly
dismissed the petition.

CLAIMANT filed a petition in the Court of Claims, June 5,
1883, alleging that Sterling T. Austin, of the parish of Carroll,
in the State of Louisiana, died in that State July 9, 1879 ; that
March 20, A.D. 1883, claimant was duly appointed adininistratrix of the estate of said decedent, and duly qualified as
such; and that her letters of administration were in full force.
The petition set up an act of Congress, approved March 3,
1883, c. 111, 22 Stat. 8041, entitled " An act for the relief of the
representatives of Sterling T. Austin, deceased," which referred
the claims of the successors in interest and legal representatives
of Sterling T. Austin for cotton taken by the military authorities of the United States during the war to the Court of
VOL. CLV-27

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Counsel for Appellant.

Claims, to adjust and settle and to render judgment for the
net amount realized by the United States therefrom, removing
the bar of any statute of limitation, and providing that it be
shown to the satisfaction of the court that neither Austin nor
.any of his surviving representatives "gave any aid or comfort
to the late rebellion, but were throughout the war loyal to the
government of the United States."
It was then charged that, in the years 1863, 1864, and 1865,
the military authorities took from Sterling T. Austin, claimant's decedent, in the States of Louisiana and Texas, large
amounts of cotton; that the United States sold said cotton
and realized therefrom various sums, aggregating $367,500,
which they appropriated to their own use; that Sterling T.
Austin left him surviving a widow and children; that neither
he nor his widow, ndr either of his children, "gave any aid or
comfort to the late rebellion, but they and each of them were
and was throughout the war loyal to the government of the
United States." Judgment was asked "for the sum of three
hundred and sixty-seven thousand live hundred dollars, being
the net amount realized by the United States from the sale of
the cotton hereinbefore referred to and described."
The averments of the petition were traversed by the United
States. The Court of Claims filed findings of fact and a conclusion of law.
The court was not satisfied that Sterling T. Austin did not
give aid or comfort to the late rebellion, and that he was loyal
throughout the war to the government of the United States,
and found him disloyal; but the court was satisfied that the
surviying representatives did not give any aid and comfort to
the late rebellion, but were throughout the war loyal to the
government of the United States.
The conclusion of law was that "the court decides upon the
foregoing facts that the petition be dismissed." The opinion
of the court, by Weldon, J., will be found in 25 C. Cl. 437.
Judgment having been thereupon entered dismissing the
petition, claimant appealed to this court.

CHIEF JUSTICE FuLLER,

after stating the case, delivered

the opinion of the court.
An act amending the act establishing the Court of Claims
was approved March 3, 1863, c. 92, which by its tenth section
prescribed a limitation of six years on the prosecution of
claims, and in its twelfth section provided "that in order to
authorize the said court to render a judgment in favor of any
claimant, if a citizen of the United States, it shall be set
forth in the petition that the claimant, and the original and
every prior owner thereof where the claim has been assigned,
has at all times borne true allegiance to the government of
the United States, and whether a citizen or not, that he has
not in any way voluntarily aided, abetted, or given encouragement to rebellion against the said government, which allegations may be traversed by the government, and if on the
trial such issue shall be decided against the claimant, his petition shall be dismissed." 12 Stat. 765, 767. On the same day
an act was passed authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury
to appoint special agents to collebt and receive all abandoned
or captured property in any State or Territory, or any portion
of any State or Territory, of the United States designated as
in insurrection, the second section of which required that "all
sales of such property shall be at auction to the highest
bidder, and the proceeds thereof shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States;" and the third section, after making provision for the giiing 6f bonds and the keeping of
books,," showing from whom such prop3rty was received, the
cost of transportation, and proceeds of the sale thereof,"
proceeded thus: "And any person claiming to have been the
owner of any such abandoned or captured property may, at
any time within two years after the suppression of the rebellion, prefer his claim to the proceeds thereof in the Court of
Claims; and on proof to the satisfaction of said court of his
ownership of said property, of his right to the proceeds
thereof, and that he has never given any aid or comfort to

Opinion of the Court.

the present rebellion, to receive the residue of such proceeds,
after the deduction of any purchase money which may have
been paid, together with the expense of transportation and
sale of such property, and any other lawful expenses attending the disposition thereof." Act of March 3, 1863, c. 120,
12 Stat. 820.
By joint resolution, No. 25, approved March 30, 1868, it
was resolved "that all moneys which have been received by
any officer or employ6 of the government, or any department
thereof, from sales of captured and abandoned property in
the late insurrectionary districts, under or under color of the
several acts of Congress providing for the collection and sale
of such property, and which have not already been actually
covered into the treasury, shall immediately be paid into the
treasury of the United States, together with any interest
which has been received or accrued thereon." 15 Stat. 251.
June 25, 1868, an act was approved entitled "An act to
provide for appeals from the Court of Claims and for other
purposes," allowing an appeal *to the Supreme Court of the
United States from all final judgments of the Court of Claims
adverse to the United States. The third section of this act
provided "that whenever it shall be material in any suit or
claim before any court to ascertain whether any person
did or did not give any aid or comfort to the late rebellion,
the claimant or party asserting the loyalty of any such person
to the United States during such rebellion, shall be required to
prove affirmatively that such person did, during said rebellion,
consistently adhere to the United States, and did give" no aid
or comfort to persons engaged in said rebellion; and the voluntary residence of any such person in any place where, at
any time during such residence, the rebel force or organization held sway, shall beyrimafacie evidence that such person
did give aid and comfort to such rebellion and to the persons
engaged therein." c. 71, 15 Stat. 75.
On the twentieth of August, 1866, the President issued his
proclamation declaring the rebellion suppressed throughout
the whole of the United States of America. 14 Stat. 814.
And that day was recognized as the close of the rebellion by

AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

an act of Congress passed March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 422, c. 145,
and by this court in United States v. Anderson, 9 Wall. 56.
July 4, 1868, the President issued a proclamation of pardon
and amnesty to all persons who had directly or indirectly
participated in the late rebellion, those under indictment
for treason or felony excepted, "for the offence of treason
against the United States or of adhering to their enemies
during the late civil war, with restoration of all rights of
property, except as to slaves and except, also, as to any
property of which any person may have been legally divested
under the laws of the United States" (15 Stat. 702); and on
December 25, 1868, 15 Stat. 711, a proclamation of universal
amnesty, unconditionally and without reservation, to all persons who had directly-or indirectly participated in the rebellion, " w ith restoration of all rights, privileges and immunities
under the Constitution and the laws which have been made
in pursuance thereof."
In the case of United States v. Anderson, supra, decided at
December.term, 1869, it was ruled that it was not necessary,
under the Abandoned and Captured Property Act, for a party
preferring his claim in the Court of Claims, for the proceeds
of property taken and sold under it, to prove in addition to
his own loyalty the loyalty of the person from whom he
bought the property, it having been purchased by him in good
faith and without intent to defraud the government or any
one else. Mr. Justice Davis, delivering the opinion of the
court, said: "During the progress of the war it was expected
that our forces in the field would capture property, and, as
the enemy retreated, that property would remain in the
country without apparent ownership, which should be collected and disposed of. In this condition of things Congress
acted. While providing for the disposition of this captured
ind abandoned property, Congress recognized the status of
the loyal Southern people, and distinguished between property owned by them, and the property of the disloyal. It
was not required to do this, for all the property obtained in
this manner could, by proper proceedings, have been appropriated to the necessities of the war. But Congress did not

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

think proper to do this. In a spirit of liberality it constituted
the government a trustee for so much of this property as
belonged to the faithful Southern people, and while directing
that all of it should be sold and its proceeds paid into'the
treasury, gave to this class of persons an opportunity, at any
time within two years after the suppression of the rebellion,
to bring their suit in the Court of Claims, and establish their
right to the proceeds of that portion of it which they owned,
requiring from them nothing but proof of loyalty and owner
ship." p. 65.
In United States v. Padeyford, 9 Wall. 531, also decided at
December term, 1869, Padelford, the owner of the property,
had taken the oath, and secured the benefit of the proclama
tiori of pardon issued by President Lincoln, December 8, 1863,
11 Stat. 737, before the property was seized; and it was held
that his status as a loyal citizen had been thereby restored,
and with it all his rights and property, although he had previously given aid and comfort to the rebellion; and the Chief
Justice remarked : "If, in other respects, the petitioner made
the proof which, under the act, entitled him to a decree for
the proceeds of his property, the law makes, the proof of pardon a complete substitute for proof that he gave no aid or
comfort to the rebellion."
The act making appropriations for the legislative, executive,
and judicial expenses of the government for the year ending
June 30, 1871, was passed July 12, 1870, c. 251, 16 Stat. 230,
235, and contained an appropriation of $100,000 for payment
of judgments which might be rendered by the Court of
Claims, to which a proviso was attached, as follows:
"Provided, That no pardon or amnesty granted by the
President, whether general or spedial, by proclamation or
otherwise, nor any acceptance of such pardon or amnesty,
nor oath taken, or other act performed in pursuance or as a
condition thereof, shall be admissible in evidence on the part
of any claimant in the Court of Claims as evidence in support
of any claim against the United States, or to establish the
standing of any claimant in said court, or his right to bring
or maintain suit therein; nor shall any such pardon, amnesty,

Opinion of the Court.

acceptance, oath, or other act as aforesaid, heretofore offered
or put in evidence on behalf of any claimant in said court, be
used or considered by said court, or by the appellate court
on appeal from said court, in deciding upon the claim of said
claimant, or any appeal therefrom, as any part of the proof
to sustain the claim of the claimant, or to entitle him to maintain his action in said Court of Claims, or on appeal therefrom; but the proof of loyalty required by the twelfth section
of the act of March -three,eighteen hundred and sixtjr-three,
entitled 'An act to amend an act- to establish a court for the
investigation of claims against the Ufiited States,' approved
February twenty-four, eighteen hundred and fifty-five, and by
the third section of the act entitled IAn act to provide for the
collection of abandoned property, and for the preyeution of
frauds in insurrectionary districts within the United States,'
approved -March twelve, eighteen hundred and sixty-three,
and br the third section of the act entitled 'An act to provide
for appeals from the Court of Claims, and for other purposes,'
approved June twenty-five, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight,
shall be made by proof of the matters required by said sections,
respectively, irrespective of the effect of any executive proclamation, pardon, amnesty, or other act of condonation or oblivion.
"And in all cases where judgment shall have been heretofore rendered in the Court of Claims in favor of any claimant
on any other proof of loyalty than such as is above required
and provided, and which is hereby declared to have been and
to be the true intent and meaning of said respective acts, the
Supreme Court shall, on appeal, have no further jurisdiction
of the cause, and shall dismiss the same for want of jurisdiction: And providedfurther,That whenever any pardon shall
have heretofore been granted by the President of the United
States to any person bringing suit in the Court of Claims for
the proceeds of abandoned or captured property under the
said act approved March twelve, eighteen hundred and sixtythree, and the acts amendatory of the same, and such pardon
shall recite, in substance, that such person took part in the
late rebellion against the government of the United States, or
was guilty of any act of rebellion against or disloyalty to the

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

United States, and such pardon shall have been accepted in
writing, by the person to whom the same issued, without
an express disclaimer of and protestation against such fact of
guilt contained in such acceptance, such pardon and acceptance shall be taken and deemed in such suit in the said Court
of Claims, and on appeal therefrom, conclusive evidence that
such person did take part in and give aid and comfort to the
late rebellion. and did not maintain true allegiance or consistently adhere to the United States; and on proof of such
pardon and acceptance, which proof may be heard summarily
on motion or otherwise, the jurisdiction of the court in the
case shall cease, and the court shall forthwith dismiss the suit
of such claimant."
At December term, 1871, in the case of United States v.
Klein, 13 Wall. 128, which was a case decided by the Court of
Claims, May 26, 1869; and pending here on appeal filed herein
December 11, 1869, this court held, the Chief Justice delivering the opinion, that the Captured and Abandoned Property
Act did not confiscate, or in any case absolutely divest, the
property of the original owner, even though disloyal, and
that by the seizure the government constituted itself a trustee
for those who were entitled or whom it should thereafterwards recognize as entitled; that persons who had faithfully
accepted the provisions offered by the proclamation of pardon
of December 8, 1863, became entitled to the proceeds of their
property thus paid into the treasury, on application within
two years from the close of the war; and that the proviso in
question was unconstitutional and void, its substance being
that an acceptance of a pardon without a disclaimer should be
conclusive evidence of the acts pardoned, but should be null
and void as evidence of rights conferred by it, both in the
Court of Claims and in this court; that the proviso denied to
pardons granted by the President the effect which this court
had adjudged them to have; that the denial of jurisdiction to
this court as well as the Court of Claims was founded solely
on the application of a rule of decision, in causes pending,
prescribed by Congress, amounting to a rule for the decision
of a cause in a particular way ; and that the proviso invaded

AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

the powers both of the judicial and executive departments of
the government. Mr. Justice Miller and Mr. Justice Bradley
dissented, on the ground that, although they agreed that the
proviso was unconstitutional, they could not concur in the
proposition that under the Captured and Abandoned Property
Act there remained "in the former owner, who had given aid
and comfort to the rebellion, any interest whatever in the
propertyor its proceeds when it had been sold and paid into
the Treasury or had been converted to the use of the public
under that act." This was followed by .'s. A'mtrong's Case,
13 Wall. 154, and Pargoud'sCase, 13 Wall. 156.
In. Carlisle's Case, 16 Wall. 147, 153, December term, 1872,
Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court, after referring to
the foregoing cases, -observed:
"After these repeated adjudications, it must be regarded as
settled in this court that the pardon of the President, whether
granted by special letters or by general proclamation, relieves
claimants of the proceeds of captured and abandoned property from the consequences of participation in the rebellion,
and from the necessity of establishing their loyalty in order
to prosecute their claims. This result follows whether we
regard the pardon as effacing the offence, blotting it out, in
the language of the cases, as though it had never existed, or
regard persons pardoned as necessarily excepted from the
general language of the act, which requires claimants to make
proof of their adhesi6n, during the rebellion, to the United
States. It is not to be supposed that Congress intended-by
the general language of the act to encroach upon any of the
prerogatives of the ,President, and especially that benign prerogative of mercy which lies in the pardoning power. It is
more reasonable to conclude that claimants, restored to their
rights of property, by the pardon of the President, were not
in contemplation of Congress in passing the act, and were not
intended to be embraced by the requirement in question. All
general terms in statutes should be limited in their application, so as not to lead to injustice, oppression, or any unconstitutional operation, if that be possible. It will be presumed
that exceptions were intended which would avoid results of
that nature."

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion cf the Court.

In laycraft v. United States, 22 Wall. 81, 92, it was held,
at October term, 1874, that under the provision of the act of
March 12, 1863, that any person claiming to be the owner of
captured or abandoned property might "at any time within
two y ears after the suppression of the rebellion, prefer his
claim to the proceeds thereof in the Court of Claims, and, on
proof

.

.

.

that he has never given any aid or comfort to

the present rebellion," receive the proceeds of the sale of such
property, a person who had given aid and comfort to the rebellion and who had not been pardoned until after two years from
the suppression of the rebellion could not, on then preferring
his petition, obtain the benefit of the act, even though in cases
generally the limitation of actions in that court was one of
six years; that the question was not one of limitation but of
jurisdiction, and that the inability of an unpardoned rebel to
sue in the Court of Claims did not control the operation of the
statute. The court said, through Mr. Chief Justice Waite:
"A sovereign cannot be sued in his own courts, except with
his consent. This is an action against the United States in its
own Court of Claims. The appellant must, therefore, show
that consent has been given to its prosecution. That being
done, the jurisdiction of- the court is established and he may
proceed. Otherwise, not.." The Chief Justice pointed out
that the required consent was not contained in the Captured
and Abandoned Property Act itself, for the only action there
consented to was one to be commenced within two years after
the suppression of the rebellion, and that such consent could
not be found in the provision of the act of March 3, 1863,
reorganizing the Court of Claims, c. 92, 12 Stat. 765, 767,
that the court might determine all claims "founded upon
any' contract express or implied with the government of the United States," unless there was an implied
promise by the United States to pay to every owner of captured or abandoned property, whether loyal or disloyal, the
proceeds of his property taken and sold. But that involved
the assumption that the Captured and Abandoned Property
Act contained an undertaking by the United States, at that
time, to receive and hold the property, or its proceeds if sold,

AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES.

in trust for the use and benefit of the owner, whoever he
might be, and that the trust in favor of the owner having
then been created, the remedy for its enforcement in the
Court of Claims as a contract was restored to a disloyal
owner by the operation of the President's proclamation.
Now, the statute was a war measure, and embraced private
property abandoned by its owner or liable to capture, and the
capture of cotton was legitimate under the circumstances.
.Mrs. Alexander's Cotton, 2 Wall. 404, 419. As, however,
friends as well as foes might suffer in the indiscriminate
seizure likely to follow the authority given, it was provided
that any owner might, within two years after the suppression
of the rebellion, prefer his claim, and upon proof of his ownership and loyalty receive the money realized by the United
States. Under the ruling in- lein's case the effect of the act
was to provide a reward for submissiorn to the government and,
the acceptance of amnesty, as well as authority for the seizure
of the property, and, according to the doctrine of that case,
if a suit was commenced within two years, a pardoned enemy
could recover as well as a loyal friend, but the commencement
of the suit within the prescribed time was a condition precedent to the ultimate relief. There was no promise, except to
such as should commence the suit in time, and upon the trial
be in a condition to bring themselves within the requirements
of the act. The promise was express and there- was no room
left for implication. Both the right to persons to demand and
receive a restoration of their property taken, and the remedy
by which that right was to be enforced, were created by the
same statute, and in such cases the remedy afforded was exclusive of all others. That remedy was the only one of which
the Court of Claims, or any other court, had been authorized
to take jurisdiction, and as the claimant had neglected to avail
himself of that remedy, he was consequently without any, and
the Court of Claims was right in concluding that it had no
jurisdiction.
In Knote v. United States, certain personal property of the
claimant had been seized, libelled, condemned, and forfeited
by the decree of a District Court, -on the ground of his treason,

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

and the proceeds paid into the treasury prior to the proclamation of December 25, 1868, after which claimant brought
suit for the proceeds, relying on that proclamation, but the
Court of Claims, 10 C. Cl. 397, decided that he was not entitled
to recover, and dismissed the petition. The judgment was
affirmed by this court at October term, 1877. Jhinote v. United
States, 95 U. S. 149. It was held that the general pardon and
amnesty granted by the proclamation of December 25, 1868,
did not entitle one receiving their benefits to the proceeds of
his property previously condemned and sold under the confiscation act of July 17, 1862, after such proceeds had been paid
into the treasury of the United States; although a full pardon released the offender from all penalties imposed by the
offence pardoned, and restored to him all his civil rights, it
did not affect any rights which were vested in others directly
by the execution of the judgment for the offence, or which
had been acquired by others whilst that judgment was in
force. And if the proceeds of the property of the offender
had been paid into the treasury, the right to them had so far
become vested in the United States that they could only be
recovered by him through an act of Congress. Moneys once
in the treasury could only be withdrawn by an appropriation
by law.
Mr. Justice Field, announcing the decision, referred, among
other cases, to Osborn v. United States, 91 U. S.474, and said:
"An attempt is made by counsel to give some expressions used
in the opinion of the court a wider meaning, so as to support
the claim here presented; but the language will not sustain
the conclusion sought. There was no consideration of the
effect of the pardon upon the proceeds of the forfeited property when paid into the Treasury, but only of its effect upon
those proceeds whilst under the control of the court in its registry. Any language which seemingly admits of a broader
interpretation must be restricted to the facts of the case.
There was no intention of expressing any opinion that a
pardon could do away with the constitutional requirement
as to money in the Treasury; whilst there, it is the property
of the United States. . . . The claim here presented rests

AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

upon a supposed implied contract to pay to the claimant the
money received as the proceeds of the forfeited property. To
constitute such a contract, there must have been some consideration moving to the United States; or they must have
received the money, charged with a duty to pay it over; or
the claimant must have had a lawful right to it when it was
received, as in the case of money paid by mistake."
In Hart v. United States, 118 U. S. 62, it was decided on
appeal from the Court of Claims, (adjudged there June 7,
1880, and, on rehearing, May 16, 1881,) that that court, which
had found the claimant to be a person who had "sustained the
late rebellion," and diat the claim accrued before April 13,1861,
did not err in deciding that it had no jurisdiction to proceed
to judgment, as the payment of such a claim was forbidden
by joint resolution No. 46, approved March 2, 1867, 14 Stat.
571; that although before the joint resolution was passed the
claimant had received from the President a pardon "for all
offences committed by him arising from participation, direct
or implied, in the rebellion," the pardon did not authorize the
payment of the claim, nor did the joint resolution take away
anything which the pardon had conferred; and that it was
entirely within the competency of Congress to declare that
the claims mentioned in the joint resolution should not be paid
until the further order of Congress.
On the same day that the Austin act was passed, March 3,
1883, an act entitled "An act to afford assistance and relief to
Congress and the executive departments in the investigation
of claims and demands against the government," c. 116, 22
Stat. 485, was approved, of which the fourth section was. as follows: "Sec. 4. In an,, case of a claim for supplies or stores
taken by or furnished to any part of military or naval forces
of the United States for thei: use during the late war for the
suppression of the rebellion, the petition shall aver that the
person who furnished such supplies or stores, or from whom
such supplies or stores were taken, (lid not give any aid or
comfort to said rebellion, but was throughout that war loyal
to the government of the United States, and the fact of such
loyalty shall be a jurisdictional fact; and unless the said court

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

shall, on a preliminary inquiry, find that the person who furnished such supplies or stores, or from whom the same were
taken as aforesaid, was loyal to the government of the United
States throughout said war, the courts shall not have jurisdiction of said cause, but the same shall, without further proceedings, be dismissed."

Twenty years after the passage of the Captured and Abandoned Property Act; nearly fifteen years after the close of
the rebellion and the proclamations of amnesty ; twelve years
after the decision of Klein's, Armstrong's, and Pargoud's cases;
eighteen years after the conversion of the cotton for whose
proceeds the suit was brought; fifteen years after the proceeds
were covered into the Treasury; and nearly four years after
the death of Austin, the act proceeded on was passed. Referring to Austin's neglect to sue, the Court of Claims remarked: "This court was open to him until August 20, 1868;
ready to adjudicate the claim, in the freshness of the memory
of witnesses, then living, and able to testify with absolute certainty.

.

.

.

From the facts and circumstances, indicated

by the proof, we conclude that the decedent was embarrassed
by his inability to establish in this court his adherence to the
United States, as required by law; and from that embarrassment originates his failure to prosecute his case within this
jurisdiction." Loyal or not, he did not bring suit within the
time prescribed by either of the acts of 1863, and if disloyal,
whether his transgression was obliterated by the proclamation
of July 4, or that of December 25, 1868, was not important.
Since it cannot be controverted that it is for Congress to
determine when and under what circumstances the government may be sued, and that the Court of Claims has the right
to entertain jurisdiction of cases against the United States and
proceed to judgment only by virtue of acts of Congress granting such jurisdiction, and is limited precisely to such cases
both in regard to parties and the cause of action as Congress
,has prescribed, De Groot v. United States, 5 Wall. 419, 431,

the inquiry is, whether this suit can be sustained under the
act authorizing it to be commenced, on the theory that loyalty
in fact was not a condition to the exercise of jurisdiction, and,

AUSTIN v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

on the merits, was rendered immaterial by the general amnesty. The act, c. 111, 22 Stat. 804, reads as follows:
"That the claims of the successors in interest and legal representatives of Sterling T. Austin, deceased, late of the parish
of Carroll, in the State of Louisiana, for cotton taken by the
military and civil authorities of the United States, or by either
of them, during the years eighteen hundred and sixty-three,
eighteen hundred and sixty-four, and eighteen hundred and
sixty-five, in the States of Louisiana and Texas, be, and the
same are hereby, referred to the Court of Claims, with full
jurisdiction and power in the said court to adjust and settle
such claims, and to Tender a judgment in said cause for the
net amount realized by the United States from the sale of
such cotton as shall appear from the evidence to have been so
taken by said authorities; and in such action the said representatives shall be entitled to recover as aforesaid, any statute
of limitation to the contrary notwithstanding: Pr.ovided,however, That it be shown to the satisfaction of the court that
neither Sterling T. Austin' senior, nor any of his surviving
representatives gave any aid or comfort to the late rebellion,
but were throughout the war loyal to the government of the
United States."
In lFoorhees v. Bank of the United States, 10 Pet. 449, 471,
certain acts required to be done previous to a sale were prescribed by a proviso, and were held to be conditions precedent,
it being stated by Mr. Justice Baldwin that the effect-of a proviso in deeds and laws is to declare that the grant made shall
not operate, or the authority conferred shall not be exercised,
unless in the case provided.
"The office of a proviso, generally," said Mr. Justice Story
in Minis v. United States, 15 Pet. 423, 445, "is either to
except something from the enacting clause or to qualify or
restrain its generalities, or to exclude some possible ground of
misinterpretation of it, as extending to cases not intended by
the legislature to be brought within its purview."
While we concede that the law does not attach a fixed and
invariable meaning to a proviso, we think it clear that this
proviso negatived the authority granted beyond the limit

defined. It operated upon the entire enacting clause, and
made loyalty a jurisdictional fact, since the consent to the
prosecution of the suit was given upon the condition that that
fact should be established. The Court of Claims was vested
with jurisdiction to adjust the claim and render judgment,
and the representatives of Austin were declared entitled to
recover notwithstanding the two-year or the six-year bar,
provided Austin were shown to the satisfaction of the court
not to have given any aid or comfort to the late rebellion,
and to have been loyal throughout the war to the government
of the "United States, and not otherwise, and the effect of the
proviso cannot be confined to the right of recovery merely.
Congress in making this requirement in no respect attempted
to 'defeat the operation of the President's proclamation of
fifteen years before, which could not control the power of Congress in the matter of giving or withholding jurisdiction. In
declining to bestow jurisdiction in favor of pardoned offenders,
whose claims were barred, Congress did not deny its proper
constitutional effect to amnesty. To whom the privilege of
suit should be accorded was for Congress alone to determine.
It is contended that the words in reference to the establishment of loyalty are in substance the same as those used in the
third section of the Captured and Abandoned Property Act,
and that Congress must be held to have employed them in the
Austin act in view of the interpretation of the former act by
the decisions of the courts of the United States, and that that
interpretation became as much a part of the Austin act as if
written out there. If this were so, it would be difficult to
assign any reason for the insertion of the proviso so far as
Austin was concerned, for it would be made to read, provided,
however, that it be shown to the satisfaction of the court that
Austin was loyal in fact, although the amnesty proclamations
immaterial.
have rendered that
But it is not so. Undoubtedly Congress framed this act
with due regard to the state of decision under the prior act,
and hence, instead of making proof of loyalty an integral-part
of claimant's case with his ownership of the property and his
right to the proceeds, as in the Captured and Abandoned Prop-

Opinion of the Court.

erty Act, it made the establishment of loyalty in fact, as contradistinguished from innocence in law produced by pardon,
a prerequisite to jurisdiction. Consent to be sued was given
only on this condition.
Nor do we perceive any ground for imputing the intention
to Congress to revive the Captured and Abandoned Property
Act for the purposes of this action. This is not the case of the
revival of a law by express regnactment, or by the repeal of a
repealing clause; and if such had been the intention of Congress, no reason suggests itself why Congress should not have
unequivocally said so.
Again it is argued that because in the fourt] section of the
general act of March 3, 1883, the fact of loyalty was stated
to be "a jurisdictional fact," therefore the proviso of the Austin
act should not be construed to have that effect, because, while
the same language was used as to the existence of loyalty, its
establishment was not in terms expressed to be jurisdictional.
But the structure of the two acts was different and required
different treatment, and the special act cannot properly be
construed as if it weee a general act and part of a general
system and the change of phraseology in this particular significant. On the contrary, as we have no doubt. that the
effect of the proviso is such as we have attributed to it, we
think the argument for the Government not unreasonable
that Congress, in employing the same language in both acts as
to the condition of loyalty, did so in effectuation of a common
object to be attained by the requirement.
As the President's proclamation could neither give jurisdiction to nor take it away from the Court of Claims, and Congress had the power to determine what classes of persons
should be recognized in that court, and over what claims its
jurisdiction should be exercised, we are of opinion that the
court rightly held it to be its duty to determine as a preliminary question whether the decedent had given any aid or comfort to the late rebellion or was loyal throughout the war to
the government of the United States, and, having found that
he was not thus loyal, properly dismissed the petition. Judgmnt af.rmed.
