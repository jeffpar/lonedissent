LEWIS v. PIMA COUNTY.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF
ARIZONA.
No. 550. Submitted October 17, 1894. -Decided October 29, 1894.

The act of the legislature of Arizona of February 21, 1883, authorizing
Pima County in that Territory to issue its bonds in aid of the construction of a railway, is a violation of the restrictions imposed upon territorial legislatures by Rev. Stat. ยง 1889, as amended by the act of June 8,
1878, c. 168, and the bonds issued under the authority assumed to be
conferred by that statute created no obligation against the county which
a court of law can enforce.

THIS was an action originally begun in the District Court

of the First Judicial District of Arizona upon 2250 coupons
