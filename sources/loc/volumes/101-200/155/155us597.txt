POTTS v. CREAGER.
Statement of the Case.

POTTS v. CREAGER.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 94. Argued November 23, 1S94. -Decided January 7, 1895.
The machine patented to Clayton Potts and Albert Potts by letters patent
No. 322,393, issued July 14, 1885, for a new and useful improvement in
clay disintegrators, and the machine patented to: them by letters patent
No. 368,898, issued August 23, 1887, for an improvement upon the prior
patent, contained new and useful inventions, and the letters patent
therefor are valid, and are infringed by the machines manufactured
and sold by the defendants in error.
The cases treating of letters patent for new applications of old devices
considered, and as- a result of the authorities, it is held that, if the
new use be so nearly analogous to the former one, that the applicability
of the device to its new use would occur to a person of ordinary mechanical skill, it is only a case of double use; but if the relations between
them be remote, and especially if the use of the old device produce a
new result, it may involve an exercise of the inventive faculty-much
depending upon the nature of the changes required to adapt the device
to its new use.

THis was a bill in equity by 0. & A. Potts & Co., an Indiana corporation, against the firm of Jonathan Craager's
Sons, of Cincinnati, for the infringement of patent No. 322,393,
issued July 14, 1885, to Clayton Potts and Albert Potts for
a clay disinteorator; and also of patent No. 368,898, issued
August 23, 1887, to the same inventors for an improvement
upof the prior patent. A third patent to George Potts, No.
384,278, was originally included in the bill, but by stipulation
between the parties all reference to this patent was cancelled,
and the bill treated as if formally amended by alleging infringement of the first two patents only.
In the first patent, No. 322,393, the patentees stated the
object of their invention to be "to disintegrate the.clay by
means of a revolving cylinder, which shall remove successive
portions from a mass of clay which is automatically pressed
against the cylinder."
This was accomplished by a cylinder containing a series of
steel bars, fitted into longitudinal grooves in the periphery of

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Statement of the Case.

the cylinder, where they were secured by flush screws at each
end, by means of which they were adjusted, so as to present a
sharp corner, projecting above the surface of the cylinder.
Opposite the cylinder was a strong vibratory plate mounted
on a shaft, so as to swing in its bearings, by the aid of an
eccentric wheel. The opposed sides of the cylinder and the
upper and central portions of the plate formed a trough, one
side of which approached and receded from the other at
intervals, and which had at the bottom a narrow opening of
constant width. In the operation of the machine, the plate
was swung back, so as to leave as large an opening as possible, and the moist untempered clay was thrown into the
trough between the cylinder and the upper portion of the
plate.

By a rapid revolution of the cylinder, successive por-

tions of the clay were removed from the mass, carried through
the narrow opening by means of the scraping bars, and at the
same time the upper portion of the plate moved slowly toward
the cylinder, thus keeping the mass of clay in close contact
with the cylinder, as successive portions were removed.
The only claim alleged to be infringed was the sixth, which
reads as follows:
"6. In a clay disintegrator, the combination with cylinder
A, having a series of longitudinal grooves, of the scraping
bar c,and adjustably secured in said grooves for the purpose
speciffed."
In the second patent, No. 368,898, which was for an improvement upon the first, there was substituted in lieu of the
swinging plate, shown by the first patent, as co6perating
with the revolving cylinder, a plain cylinder set opposite the
cutting cylinder, and revolving therewith in close proximity,
so that the raw clay might be fed, shredded, and discharged
in an even and continuous manner, in readiness to be taken
directly to the pug or other mill. The patentees further
stated in their specification:
"The machine shown in our letters patent No. 322,393 was
provided with a swinging or vibrating plate to coact with the
cutting cylinder in effecting the shredding of the clay which
was fed between them. In such machine the abuttingsurface

POTTS v. CREAGER.
Statement of the Case.

of the vibrating plate furnished a rest or bearing for the clay in
presenting the same to the action of the cutter knives. This
abutting surface was limited in extent and unchanging in position, so that it became rapidly worn. By substituting the revolving roll for the vibrating plate, this objection is greatly
lessened. The roll- constantly presents new surfaces to the
cutters, so that the wear is even and regular throughout its
circuit. If any inequalities exist in the roll at the outset these
become rapidly reduced, so that. by use the cylinder wears
more and more true, and acts thus with constantly better
effect. Aside from cheapness in construction, the revolving
roller or cylinder machine will work wet or sticky clays with
perhaps one-third of the power necessary in treating such clays
in the vibratory-plate machine. Such plate tends constantly
to crowd or squeeze the passing clays, whereas the revolving
roll yields continuously, so that clogging is less apt to occur at'
the sam6 time that the clay is finely and evenly shredded, the
cutter cylinder moving, by preference, more rapidly than the
companion feed-roll in order to accomplish this effect.
"Prior t6 our invention it has been very common to employ
in clay mills, sugar mills, and the like a set of rolls between
which the material passed as the rolls were revolved; but in
such machines the operation of the rolls was merely to break
up the clogs of clay and squeeze or crush the same, whereas,
by our invention the clay is positively cut into fine shreds or
clippings in much better condition to be tempered and moulded
than by the old forms of disintegrating machines."
The following drawing illustrates the main features of the
machine, so far as the same are material to the present case:

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

Defendants were charged with infringing the first and second claims of this patent, which read as follows:
"1. In the supporting frame of a clay disintegrator, a rotating cylinder longitudinally grooved and carrying cutting bars
in and projecting beyond the grooves, in combination with a
smooth-faced rotating cylinder adapted to carry and hold the
clay against the cylinder -having the cutting bars thereon,
which latter cut or shred the clay and pass the same between
the cylinders, substantially as set forth.
"2. In clay disintegrators, the combination with the main
supporting frame and with a rotating cylinder fixed therein
and having longitudinal cutting bars projecting beyond the
face thereof, of a positively-revolving companion cylinder
fixed opposite thereto in said frame and having a smooth face
or surface, with which said cutting bars directly coperate to
shred or clip the clay as the same is fed by and passed between
said cylinders, substantially as described."
The answer denied any patentable novelty in these patents,
in view of the prior art as shown by numerous e trlier patents,
to which reference was made; and also denied infringement,
alleging that defendants were manufacturing clay pulverizers
under authority of patents granted to Jonathan and Harry M.
Creager in 1888.
The case came on for hearing upon pleadings and proofs,

MR. JUSTicE B owN, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.

Beds of clay are composed of different strata; and the first
step necessary to be taken in the manufacture of such clay is
a thorough mixing of the strata, and the reduction of the

POTTS v. CREAGER.

Opinion of the Court.

clay to a suitable condition. Otherwise, the product will contain laminations, will shrink unevenly and check in burning,
scale or peel off in use, and be less valuable than products made
of clays which are first thoroughly mixed and tempered, and
reduced to a homogeneous mass before being manufactured
into the product. Prior to the Potts inventions various methods seem to have been employed to secure this result. The
clay had been sometimes spaded up in the autumn, subjected
to the action of the frost during the winter, and then to the
operation of the old-fashioned grinding pit. A mud-wheel had
also been used. The "soak pit" was another means used to
accomplish the same result- the clay being deposited in a pit
of water and allowed to remain until the soaking process had
reduced it to the desired condition. These methods were slow
and expensive. Both grinding machines and crushing rolls
had .been adopted in comparatively recent years. Their action
was simply to crush the clay, the different strata being pressed
together and made more compact, and the clay discharged
from the rolls in cakes or sheets, a condition that made the
tempering very difficult, as the clay thus treated would not
readily receive or absorb the water.
The object of the Potts inventions was not to crush the
clay, as had been previously done, but to disintegrate and
pulverize it, leaving it in a loose condition, fitted to absorb
the water readily. Their machines consisted substantially of
a cylinder moving at a high speed, having longitudinal bars
fixed in its periphery with sharp projecting corners, and a
fixed abutment in close proximity thereto -in the first patent
a swinging plate - in the second a smooth cylinder - and a
positive feeding device by which the clay was forced between
the main cylinder and the abutment. The longitudinal bars
thus operated to strike the mass of clay quick, sharp blows in
rapid succession, and cut or shred small portions therefrom,
which were deposited beneath the machine, thoroughly mixed
in their different strata, and with rough, torn, or ruptured
edges -a condition best adapted to receive or absorb water,
and be easily and thoroughly tempered.
The only feature of the first patent material to be considered

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

is the cylinder described in the sixth claim as a cylinder "having a series of longitudinal grooves, of the scraping bars c,
adjustably secured in said grooves, for the purpose specified."
This cylinder is alleged to have been anticipated in devices
shown in eight prior patents, each of which will be briefly
mentioned.
1. A patent of 1865, to Robert Butterworth, for an improvement in machines for grinding apples, exhibits a cylinder
with cutting knives or blades on its periphery. These knives
have serrated or toothed edges, which form chisel-shaped cutting projections, and are provided with means for adjustment
so as to protrude more or less beyond the periphery of the
cylinder. When the cylinder is rotated, the apples are cut
or ground by the knives between the cylinder and a plate
somewhat similar to the swinging plate of the first Potts
patent, provided with springs adapted to throw the plate
back, whenever any stones or hard foreign substances have
passed through the machine. While these knives are set
upon the periphery of the cylinder in much the same way as
the scraping bars of the Potts patents, it is really the only
point of resemblance between the two devices. The Butterworth patent could not possibly have been used as a clay disintegrator without changes which would involve more or less
invention.
2. A patent granted in 1880, to one Ennis, exhibits a machine for preparing paper pulp, and consists of a revolving
cylinder armed with longitudinal knives, and a stationary
plate also armed with knives, mounted beneath it in close
proximity thereto. Rags fed between the revolving and stationary knives are thus cut in pieces. The reasons given
why the Butterworth patent does not anticipate the Potts inventions apply with equal force to this.
3. A patent granted in 1866 to one Frost exhibits another
grinding cylinder for paper engines, and consists of a skeleton cylinder armed with sharp cutting blades, secured adjustably, so as to be moved out from the axis of the cylinder, as
they wear. The cylinder is manifestly inapplicable to the disintegration of clay, and nothing besides the cylinder is shown.

POTTS v. CREAGER.
Opinion of the Court.

4. A patent to one Van Name, granted in 1881, shows a
roller for grinding mills, provided with blades arranged in
longitudinal grooves around the surface parallel with the axis.
These blades are made of hardened steel, and of soft iron,
hardened paper or wood, placed alternately with the steel
blades. The surface of the roller is practically smooth, except
that in use, the soft material will wear more rapidly than the
hard. This results in maintaining a corrugated roller until
the strips are worn out. It can be of no possible service to
the defendant in this connection.
5. The patent issued in 1869 to one Peabody for a cottonseed huller also exhibits a rotary cylinder armed with knives
set in grooves, each having a chisel-shaped cutting edge, and
adjustable for the purpose of increasing or diminishing the
cut. It is evidently not adapted to the .working of clay.
6. The same remark may be made of the patent to Mayfield of 1871 for a grinding mill, such as are adapted for general use among farmers. It also consists of a cylinder provided with knives or plane bits set in longitudinal grooves.
These knives are also adjustable.
7. A patent to J. W. Smith, granted in 1881, is for an apparatus for preparing wheat for grinding, in which a cylinder
is employed similar to that of the Mayfield patent, with a
series of plane bits projecting from the periphery. These
plane bits are adjustably bolted by screws Sand slots within
the cylinder, while their cutting edges protrude from slots
outwardly from the rim of the cylinder. They do not differ
in principle from the knives of Peabody and Mayfield.
8. A patent to one Rudy granted in 1875 for an improvement in clay pulverizers is the only one which is used in connection with -the preparation or manufacture of clay, and
consists of a pulverizing roller in combination with separate
concave springs, or an elastic bed for supporting the clay
while the roller revolves therein, after which it falls through
a sieve and descends to a second cylinder, and then to a third.
The patent does not describe distinctly how the rollers are
made, but they would seem to be fluted, and cast in a series
of sections. The process employed seems to have been rather

OCTOBER TERMI,

Opinion of the Court.

a grinding than a disintegrating process, and it would seem that
such a machine would be inoperative except perhaps where the
clay was dry and of light consistency. The cylinder evidently
operates upon a wholly different principle from that of the
Potts patents.
Other patents are shown bearing a greater or less resemblance to these, but generally used for wholly different purposes, such as for straw cutters, machines for pressing tobacco,
pulp engines, peat machines, feed boxes for roller mills, and
machines for removing hair from hides. So far as they are
used for working clay, they would appear to differ radically
in principle from the Potts patent. An exhibit much relied
upon, known as the Creager Wood Polishing Machine, shows
a cylinder, provided on its periphery with a series of projecting strips or bars of glass, not differing materially in form
from plaiyitiffs' scrapers, and like them fitted into longitudinal
grooves. The machine was used for polishing boards, which
were run between the cylinder and a support and pressure
roller journalled underneath, and connected with an automatic
adjustable contrivance.' Had this machine been used for an
analogous purpose, it would evidently have been an anticipation of the Potts cylinder, since the substitution of steel for
glass strips would not of itself have involved invention.
This device was constructed in 1874, was used for only half
an hour when by an accident several of the scrapers or polishers were broken, and before others could be moulded the building took fire and burned down. That it was not considered a
success is evident from the fact that the machine was never
reconstructed, but in 1878 Creager took out a patent for a
similar machine, in which a smooth or corrugated roller of
wood, glass, bone, ivory, or metal was the distinctive feature.
In short, the machine of 1874 appears to have been merely an
abandoned experiment.
As already stated, the second Potts patent is for the combination of the cylinder described in the first patent with
another smooth-faced rotating cylinder, adapted to carry and
hold the clay against the first cylinder, which cuts and shreds
it as it passes between them. It seems that the swinging plate,

POTTS v. CREAGER.
Opinion of the Court.

described in the first patent as coacting with the cutting
cylinder in shredding the clay, was limited in the extent of
its cutting surface, and was unchangeable in position, so that
it became rapidly worn. To obviate this difficulty a revolving
roller was substituted for the plate. As this roller constantly
presented a new surface to the cutter, the wear was even and
regular over its entire circumfdrence. If any inequalities existed in the roller at the outset they became rapidly reduced,
so that by use the cylinder constantly wears truer, and thus
cuts with better effect. There was also an advantage in greater
cheapness of construction, and in the ability of the roller to
work in wet and sticky clays, with much less power than was
necessary in treating such clays with the vibratory plate.
The employment of two parallel cylinders to cooiperate in
the performance of a certain task is so common and well
known that the court may talie judicial notice of such examples as are found in the ordinary clothes wringer, fluting
rollers, straw cutters, printing presses, paper manufacturing
machines, and grinding mills of various kinds. Indeed, this.
combination of two rollers had been before used for the purpose of grinding and crushing clay, as shown in a patent to
Alexander, granted in 1872, wherein the clay was passed
between double spiral-toothed grinding and crushing rollers,
and then between plain, cylindrical rollers, and in the patent
to Alsip and Drake of June 30, 1885, which exhibits a fluted
or corrugated cylinder in combination with a smooth-faced
companion cylinder, between which the clay is passed and
crushed, though not disintegrated. In view of these devibes
it is too clear for argument that the Potts would not be entitled to a patent simply for passing the clay between two
grinding or crushing cylinders, and it is at least open to doulbt
whether, in view of the first patent, there is any novelty in
substituting a smooth-faced roller for the swinging plate of
the first patent. But, as the sixth claim of the first patent
covers only the cylinder, the second patent may be read in
connectioii with it to show what the machine was as completed. The question whether the second patent was anticipated by the first is not presented by this record.

OCTOBER TERMA,

1894.

Opinion of the Court.

What, then, did the patentees do? They took the cylinder
shown in the Creager wood-polishing exhibit, removed the
glass bars, and substituted bars of steel; provided it with an
dbutting surface in the form of a revolving roller, and used it
for a totally distinct and different purpose. Putting aside,
for the purposes of this discussion, the fact that the Creager
cylinder was an abandoned experiment, did this involve invention? Certainly, if this exhibit does not anticipate, none of
the others do. The answer to this requires the consideration
of the often-recurring question, which has taxed the ingenuity
of courts ever since the passage of the patent acts, as to what
invention really is. When a patented device is a mere improvement upon an existing machine, and the case is not complicated by other anticipating devices, the solution is ordinarily
free from difficulty. But where the alleged novelty consists
in transferring a device from one branch of industry to another, the answer depends upon a variety of considerations.
In such cases we are bound to inquire into the remoteness
of relationship of the two industries; what alterations were
necessary to adapt the device to its new use, and what the
value of such adaptation has been to the new industry. If
the new use be analogous to the former one, the court will
undoubtedly be disposed to construe the patent more strictly,
and to require clearer proof of the exercise of the inventive
"faculty in adapting it to the new use - particularly if the
device be one of minor importance in its new field of usefulness. On the other hand, if the transfer be to a branch of
industry but remotely allied to the other, and the effect of
such transfer has been to supersede other methods of doing
the same work, the court will look with a less critical eye
upon the means employed in making the transfer. Doubtless
a patentee is entitled to every use of which his invention is
susceptible, whether such use be known or unknown to him;
but the person who has taken his device and, by improvements thereon, has adapted it to a different' industry, may
also draw to himself the quality of inventor. If, for instance,
a person were to take a coffee-mill and patent it as a mill for
grinding spices, the double use would be too manifest for seri-

POTTS *v. CREAGER.
Opinion of the Court.

ous argument. So, too, this court has denied invention to one
who applied the principle of an ice-cream freezer to the preservation of fish. Brown v. P~iper, 91 U. S. 37; to another
who changed the proportions of a refrigerator in such manner
as to utilize the descending instead of the ascending current of
cold air, Roberts v. Ryer, .91 U. S. 150; to another who employed an old and well-known fiethod of attaching car trucks
to the forward truck of a locomotive engine, Pennsylvania
Railroad v. Locomotive Truck Co., 110 U. S. 490; and to still
another who placed a dredging screw at the stem instead of
the stern of a steamboat, Atlantic Works v. Brady, 107 U. S.
192. In Tucker v. .palding, 13 Wall. 453, the patent covered the use of movable teeth in saws and saw plates. A
prior patent exhibited cutters of the same general form as the
saw teeth of the other patent, attachable to a circular disk,
and removable as in the other, the purpose of which patent
was for the cutting of tongues .and grooves, mortices, etc.
The court held that if what it actually did was in its nature
the same as sawing, and its structure and action suggested to
the mind of an ordinarily skilful mechanic this double use to
which it could be adapted without material change, then such
adaptation to a new use was riot new invention, and was not
patentable.
Upon the other hand, we have recently upheld a patent to
one who took a torsional spring, such as*had been previously
used in clocks, doors, and other articles of domestic furniture,
and applied it to telegraph instruments, the application being
shown to be wholly new. Western Electric Co. v. _La Rue,
139 U. S. 601. So, also, in Crane v. Price, Webster's Pat.
Cas. 409, the use of anthracite coal in smelting iron ore was
held to be a good invention, inasmuch as it produced a better
article of iron at a less expense, although bituminous coal had
been previously used for the same purpose. See also Steiner
v. Heald, 6 Exch. 607.
Indeed, it often requires as acute a perception of the relation between cause and effect, and as much of the peculiar
intpitive genius which is a characteristic of great inventors,
to grasp the idea that a device used in one art may be made

'OCTOBER

Opinion of the Court.

available in another, as would be necessary to create the device
de novo. And this is not the less true if, after the thing has
been done, it appears to the ordinary mind so simple as to
excite wonder that it was not thought of before. The ap.parent simplicity of a new device often leads an inexperienced person to think that it would have occurred to any
one familiar with the subject; but the decisive answer is
that with dozens and perhaps hundreds of others laboring in
the same field, it had never occurred to any one before. The
practised eye of an ordinary mechanic may be safely trusted
to see what ought to be apparent to every one. As was said
br Mr. Justice Bradley, in Loom Company v. Higgins, 105
U. S. 580, 591: "1Now that it has succeeded, it may seem very
plain to any one that he could have done it as well. This is
often the case with inventions of the greatest merit. It may
be laid down as a general rule, though perhaps not an invariable one, that if a new combination and arrangement of
known elements produce a new and beneficial result never
attained before, it is evidence of invention."
As a result of the authorities upon this subject, it may be
said that, if the new use be so nearly analogous to the former
one, that the applicability of the device to its new use would
occur to a person of ordinary mechanical skill, it is only a case
of double use, but if the relations between them be remote,
and especially if the use of the old device produce a new
result, it may at least involve an exercise of the inventive
faculty. Much, however, must still depend upon the nature
of the changes required to adapt the device to its new use.
Applying this test to the case under consideration, it is
manifest that, if the change from the glass bars of the Creager Wood Exhibit to the steel bars of the Potts cylinder
was a mere change of material for the more perfect accomplishment of the same work, it would, within the familiar
cases of lotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 248; Hicks v.
Kelsey, 18 Wall. 670; Terkune v. Phillivs, 99 U. S. 592, and
Brown v. District of Columbia, 130 U. S. 87, not' involve invention. But not only did the glass bars prove so brittle in
their use for polishing wood that they broke and were dis-

Opinion of the Court.

carded after a half an hour's trial, but they would undoubtedly
have been wholly worthless for the new use for which the
Potts required them. Not only did they discard the' glass
bars, and substitute others of steel, but they substituted them
for a purpose wholly different from that for which they had
been employed. Under such circumstances, we have repeatedly held that a change of material was invention.
Smith v. Goodyear Dental Fulcanite Co., 93 U. S. 486 ; Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Go. v. Davis, 102 U. S. 222. None of
the cylinders to which our attention has been called resembled
the Potts cylinder so closely as does this. None of them were
used for the purpose of disintegrating, as distinguished from
crushing or grinding clay. The result appears to have been
a new and valuable one-so much so that, within a short time
thereafter, defendants themselves obtained7 a patent upon a
machine of their own to accomplish it. As we said in Smith
-v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co., 93 U. S. 486, and 3fagowan
v. New York' Belting Co., 141 U. S. 332, 343, where the question
of novelty is in doubt, the fact that the device has gone into
general use, and displaced other devices employed for a similar
purpose, is sufficient to turn the scale in favor of the invention.
Our conclusion is that the patents in question are valid.
The question of infringement presents less difficulty. Defendants' machine, in its construction and operation, is substantially the same as plaintiffs'. Instead, however, of casting
the shredding roller with a solid face, forming longitudinal
grooves therein, and fixing the steel bars in the grooves,
defendants cast the cylinder in the .form of a skeleton or
spider, the knives being respectively fastened to the several
arms projecting from the hub, one knife to each arm, and
forming the periphery by filling in metal plates between
the knives. The cylinder, when its numerous parts are bolted
together, is a perfect roll with a solid face, having cutting bars
projecting from the slots or grooves thus formed, and adjustably secured therein by means of bolts passing through them.
The operation is the same as that of the Potts machine, and
it accomplishes practically the same result by practically the
same means.
VOL. CLV-39

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Statement of the Case.

Defendants, in their trade circular advertising their own
machine, state: "Unlike the ordinary roller process, the action
of the disintegrator is to remove small portions, by cutting
from the clay fed into the hopper on the same principle as
shaving and whittling, and does not roll the clay into sheets,
thus making it unfit for proper manipulation. The past season
we have put out many of these machines in difficult clays, and
made it an obligation to work the clay both wet and dry, and
each machine has done its work well and to the entire satisfaction of the purchasers." This is a frank and apparently a
just tribute to the merits of the plaintiffs' invention, as well
as a distinct admission that their own machine accomplishes
the same result.
The decree of the court below is, therefore,
Reversed and the case remandedfor further proceedings in
conformity with this opinion.
