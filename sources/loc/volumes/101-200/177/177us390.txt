OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Syllabus.

It is well settled that this court will not proceed to adjudication where there is no subject-matter on which the judgment of
the court can operate. And although this application has not
as yet reached that stage, still as it is obvious that before a return to the writ can be made, or any other action can be taken,
the restraint of which petitioner complains would have terminated, we are constrained to decline to grant leave to file the
petition.
The situation was the same April 9, and these observations
are applicable as of that date.
In arriving at this conclusion we are not to be understood as
intimating in any degree an opinion on the question of jurisdiction or other questions pressed on our attention.
Leave denied.

WERLEIN v. NEW ORLEANS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.
No. 189.

Argued March 16, 1900. - Decided April 16, 1900.

The city of New Orleans commenced an action in March, 1895, in the Civil
District Court for the Parish of Orleans, in Louisiana, to recover from
Werlein a tract of land of which he was in possession, having acquired
title under the following circumstances: In March, 1876, one Klein commenced an action against the city, to recover principal and interest on
certain city bonds, and obtained judgment for the same in 1876. Under
a writ of fieri facias real estate of the citywas seized to satisfythe judgment, and was advertised for sale. 'The city commenced a suit against
Klein to prevent the sale, and obtained an interlocutory injunction.
After hearing this injunction was dissolved, and the complaint was dismissed. The property was then sold under the judicial proceeding to a
purchaser fhrough whom Werlein claims title. 'This suit was brought by
the city to set aside that sale, on the ground that it was null and void,
because the real estate was dedicated to public use long before the alleged sale, and formed part of the public streets of New Orleans; that
it was not susceptible to alienation or private ownership or private ilossession. Judgment was rendered in favor of the city, which was affirmed
by the Supreme Court of the State. Held:

WERLEIN v. NEWORLEANS.
Statement of the Case.
(1) That this court had jurisdiction to revise that judgment:
(2) That if there were no question of'a prior judgment, proof that the
land had been properly dedicated for a public square to the public
use, and therefore had been withdrawn from commerce, would furnish a defence to the claim by any person of a right to sell the property under an execution upon a judgment against the city:
(3) That as the city did not set up that defence, although it was open to
it to do so, in the former. action, it could not set it up now:
(4) That although the city holds property of such a nature in trust for
the public, that fact does not distinguish it from the character or
in which it holds other property, so as to bring the case within
the meaning of the rule that a judgment against a man as an administrator does not bind him as an individual:
(5) That the former judgment should have been admitted In evidence
upon the trial of this action.

THIS action was commenced in March, 1895, by the city of
New Orleans in the Civil District Court for the parish of Orleans in the State of Louisiana, for the purpose of recovering
from the defendant below, Philip Werlein, a certain lot of land
situated in that city and described in the petition and of which
he was in possession. The facts .upon which the suit was
brought are as follows:
In March, 1876, one John Klein, a citizen of the State of
Mississippi, commenced an action against the city of INew Orleans in the Circuit Court of the United States in the District
of Louisiana, for the recovery of over, $89,000 and interest upon
certain bonds 'issued by that- city, and fully described in the
plaintiff's petition. The city filed an answer denying all and
singular the allegations contained in the plaintiff's petition.
The case came on for hearing before the court without a jury,
a jury being waived, and resulted in a judgment for the plaintiff against the city for the sum of $89,000, with six per cent
interest, as stated in the judgment, which was entered on May 2,
1876. The plaintiff, in order to obtain satisfaction, issued a
fieri facia8 on the judgment to the marshal, who thereupon
seized and took into his possession all the right, title and interest of the city in and to the portion of ground described in
the marshal's return to the writ (and being the premises in
question) and advertised the property for sale. The city of
New Orleans thereupon commenced an action against Klein

Statement of the Case.

in the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of
Louisiana, to prevent him from selling the property under his
judgment.
In its bill of complaint the city alleged the recovery of judgment by Klein against the city, that he had issued a writ of
fieri -facias upon such judgment for the purpose of enforcing
satisFaction of the same and had s6ized under the writ the property already described, which was advertised to be sold on a
day named in the bill, and that Klein had no right to issue the
Writ in that suit, or to cause the seizure, advertisement or sale
of the property thereunder, for the reasons and causes stated in
the bill, which were, (1) that he had registered the judgment
in the office of the administrator of public accounts for the city
of New Orleans in accordance with an act of the legislature
passed in the year 1870, and, therefore, had no right to issue
any writ for the collection of the judgment agaiust the city;
'(2) because Klein had assigned and transferred all his interest
in the judgment before the writ was issued, to certain parties
named; (3) that the writ upon which the property had been
seized and advertised to be sold had issued for a larger sum
than was due on the judgment: the city therefore prayed for
an injunction restraining Klein, his attorneys and agents, from
proceeding further in the advertisement and sale of the property under the writ; that the seizure of the property by the
marshal might be adjudged to be illegal and void, and for general relief.
An order to show cause why an injunction pendente lite
should not issue was granted, and upon a hearing it was ordered to issue.
The defendant Klein answered the bill, admitted the seizure
of the property, and that it was advortised for sale; also, that
he had procured his judgment to be registered as alleged in the
bill, but denied that he thereby lost or forfeited any other
remedy for the enforbement of the judgment, especially that
of an ordinary execution; admitted the assignment of his judgment, but alleged that it was only as a security or pledge, and
denied that the writ issued for a larger sum than was due, and
he therefore asked that the injunction pendente lite might be

WERLEIN v. NEW ORLEANS.
Statement of the Case.

dissolved, the perpetual injunction denied, and for such further
relief as might be proper.
The case came on for hearing on bill and answer, and the
court "Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the interlocutory
injunction issued be dissolved, an injunction refused, and complainant's bill of complaint dismissed with costs." The judgment was signed June 19, 1878.
After the entry of the judgment dissolving the injunction
and dismissing the bill, the marshal took proceedings to sell
the property which he had seized, and on August 21, 1878,
sold the same to Andrew C. Lewis, the highest bidder, through
whom by several mesne conveyances the appellant claims title,
and fram. the time of the above sale he or his grantors have
been in possession.
The-petition in the present suit, filed by the city, describes
the premises in question, and alleges that the defendant, appellant herein, is in possession thereof, and unjustly claims title
thereto with the improvements thereon, valued in all at $15,000.
The city avers that the defendant is not and never was the
owner of the property, and that his only alleged title thereto
is derived through mesne conveyances from a sale made by the
United States marshal to Andrew C. Lewis, as above stated.
The city further alleges that the sale by the marshal to Lewis
was absolutely null and void, and that no title or right whatever in or to -the property passed by that sale to Lewis or
through him to the defendant herein; that the property was
dedicated to public use long prior to the date of the marshal's
sale, by Bertrand and John Gravier, and that it forms part of
the place Gravier, in the Faubourg St. Mary, in the city of New
Orleans, and that the property was at the date of the marshal's
sale and has ever since been unsusceptible to alienation or private ownership or of private possession, and that the defendant's possession is illegal and in bad faith. The petition further alleges that the city was invested by law with the administration and possession, for the public benefit, of all property
in the city dedicated to public use, and that it had the right
to sue for the recovery of the possession of and to establish
the title and right of use of the p abliq to any such property,

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Statement of the Case.

and the petition therefore prayed that the city might have
judgment against the defendant, decreeing the property purchased at the sale to be property dedicated to public use, and
recognizing plaintiff's right to the possession and administration
of the same, and ordering the defendant to deliver to plaintiff possession of the property free from all incumbrances, and
for costs.
The defendant answered the bill, and set up therein the recovery of the judgment of Klein against the city, the seizure of the
-property thereunder, the commencement of suit by the city to
enjoin the sale of the property, and the judgment of the court
thereon dismissing that bill and dissolving the injunction, and
defendant therefore alleged that the right of Klein to proceed
and sell the land described in the petition, under his execution,
was in and by that judgment recognized, affirmed and established, and such right was therefore res judicata.

Other defences were set up denying that the land had in fact
ever been dedicated to public use or that it had ever been so
used; also alleging that the city had regularly collected taxes
upon the property ever since its purchase by Lewis, (more than
fifteen years,) and that by reason of the facts the city was
estopped from maintaining its action.
Upon these pleadingsthe parties went to trial, and the plaintiff,
after giving evidence tending to prove its case, admitted that the
defendant held a regular chain of title from and through Lewis,
the purchaser of the land under the sale by the United States
marshal, but denied the validity of such title. The defendant
offered in evidence an exemplification of the proceedings and
judgment in the suit brought to enjoin the sale by the marshal,
which offer was made for the purpose of proving the plea of
res judicata. The plaintiff objected to the evidence on the
ground that the cause of action involved in the suit was not,
'identical with, the cause of action in the suit on trial, because
the sole and only issues decided in the other suit were whether
John Klein, having registered his judgment against the city of
New Orleans in the office of the comptroller, pursuant to a
statute of the State, and having elected that method of collecting his judgment, had not.waived his right to pursue any other

WERLEIN v. NEW ORLEANS.
Opinion of the Court.

method of collection; also whether John Klein was the owner
of the judgment, and if so, whether he was estopped by having
registered in the office of the comptroller a transfer of the same,
and also whether the judgment was not subject to certain credits;
whereas the issue involved in this case was whether the property
upon which it is alleged the execution was levied and the property sold was legally subject to such seizure and sale; also that
the thing demanded in the other suit was not the same thing
demanded in this suit, the prayer in the other being for an
injunction restraining Klein from selling the property in dispute, whereas the thing demanded in this 'case was a decree
declaring the sale effected by Klein absolutely null and void.
The court sustained the objection and refused to admit the evidence, and the defendant duly excepted.
Oral evidence was then given for the purpose of sustaining
the other defences set up by the defendant, and the trial having
been concluded, the judge made a finding in favor of the complainant, and judgment was thereupon entered decreeing that
the property described therein was property dedicated to public
use, and that the right of the city to the possession and administration of such property must be recognized, and the defendant was ordered to deliver possession of the property to the city
free from all incumbrances.
An appeal was taken from the judgment to the Supreme
Court of the State of Louisiana, where it was affirmed, and the
defendant below has brought the case here on writ of error.

Vr. R. A. Tielenor for defendant in error. Xr.Samuel L.

MR.JUSTICE PECKHAM, after stating the facts, delivered the

opinion of the court.
The defendant in error has made a motion to dismiss the writ
of error on the ground of want of jurisdiction. We think it
must be denied. The sole question in the case is in regard to
the validity of the exception to the decision of the trial court

refusing to admit in evidence the judgment recovered in the
United States Circuit Court in the actidn of the city of New
Orleans against Klein.
The defendant herein in his answer specially set up such judgment, and claimed that under and by virtue thereof the city was
concluded from maintaining its action; the state court refused
to give effect to the judgment, and the denial of this right was
excepted to by the defendant, and was also assigned as error in
the state Supreme Court. In such case we think a Federal
question exists.

Pittsburgh,Cincinnati,&c., Railroadv. Long

Island Trust Company, 172 U. S. 493, 507, and cases there
cited; Pheanix Insurance Company v. Tennessee, 161 U. S. 174,

184, Whether full faith and credit have been given the judgment of a Federal court by the courts of a State is a Federal
question, and that question exists in this case.
Upon the merits we have simply to inquire .whether the
courts below erred in their decision refusing to admit in evidence the judgment in the chancery suit above mentioned.
The judgment in that suit was between the city as complainant and Klein as defendant, and it had reference to the proceedings of the marshal in the execution of his writ issued upon the
judgment of Klein against the city. The defendant in this suit
traces his title back to Lewis, who purchased upon the sale
under the marshal's writ, and so when the defendant is sued in
this action he stands as privy to one of the parties to the chancery suit, and can claim the same rights in the judgment therein
as an adjudication, which Lewis or Klein could have claimed
if either were-in possession of the property, and this suit had
been brought against the one in possession.
The law in relation to the effect of a judgment between the
same parties is well known, but its proper application to par-.
ficu.lar cases'is sometimes quite difficult to determine. The following authorities treat of the subject very fully and exhaustively: Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351; Davis v.
Brown, 94 U. S. 423 ; New Orleansv. OJizens' Bank, 167 U. S.
371; Southern Pa, flo Railroad v. United States, 168 U. S.

Ann. 230; Slocomb v: Lizardi, 21 La. Ann. 355.

WERLEIN v. NEW ORLEANS.
Opinion of the Court.

In the first cited case, it was said that a former judgment
between the same parties (or their privies) upon the same cause
of action as that stated in the second-case constitutes an absolute bar to the prosecution of the second action, not only as to
every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter
which might have been offered for that purpose. Where the
second action between the same parties is upon a different claim
or demand, the judgment in the former action operates as an
estoppel only as to those matters in issue or points controverted
upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was
rendered.
So in -Davisv. Brown, suTpra, Mr. Justice Field, in delivering
the opinion of the court, said in speaking of a prior judgment:
"The judgment is not only conclusive as to what was actually
determined respecting such demand, but as to every matter
which might have been brought forward and determined respecting it."
In New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, (supra, at p. 396,) Mr.

Justice White, speaking for the court, said: "The estoppel resulting from the thing adjudged does not depend upon whether
there is the same demand in both cases, but exists, even although
there be different demands, when the question upon which the
recovery of the second demand depends has under identical circumstances and conditions been previously concluded by a
judgment between the parties or their privies."
To the same effect is Southern Pacific Railroad v. United
States, supra.

The same rule is substantially laid down in the cases above
cited from the Louisiana reports.
Now, what was the demand and what was the thing adjudged in the chancery suit between the city of New Orleans
and Klein ? In that suit the city alleged that Klein had seized
under a writ of fierifacias,in his action against the city, certain property which was described in the complainant's bill,
which he threatened to sell, and which was advertised to be
sold on a certain day, and the city alleged "that the said John
Klein has no right to issue the said writ of pluries f#eri facia$

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

in said suit, or to cause the seizure, advertisement and sale of
the said property thereunder," and it set forth in its bill the
grounds "(already stated) for such an allegation.
The sole cause of action was the apprehended and threatened
sale of the property, which sale, the complainant alleged, would
be illegal. All the other facts set up in the bill were but the
grounds justifying and proving, as contended, the allegation
that Klein had no right to sell the property, and it was this
illegality of the threatened sale that was the sole cause or
foundation of the action; it was the matter in dispute and the
subject of contest. If the property were not legally subject to
s'eizure and sale, then it would clearly be an illegal sale if consummated, and that fact would be material in proof of the
cause of action of the city.
Upon the trial the court adjudged that defendant had the
right to sell the property, and it therefore dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill, and judgment to that effect was
duly signed and entered. This would seem to be a full and
complete adjudication upon the right of defendant Klein to sell
the property seized under his writ. That right would not exist
if the property were not the subject of a legal sale. Whether
or not it was thus subject was an inquiry which the court would
have had jurisdiction to make had it been alleged in that suit.
It is, however, contended that as the city had only set up certain facts as the foundation of its action to prevent the alleged
illegal sale of the property, the judgment only bound it as to
those facts, and 'therefore it is now urged that the city in this
action was at liberty to prove other facts which would also
show that Klein had no right to sell the property, namely, that
the property had long before the sale been dedicated to public
use, and the city therefore had no right to alienate it, nor had
any one the right to sell it upon an execution issued on a judgment against the city.
It is not disputed that if there were no question of a prior
judgment in this case, proof that the land had been properly
and duly dedicated for a public square to the public use and
therefore had been withdrawn from commerce, would furnish
a defence to the claim by any person of a right to sell the prop.

erty under an execution upon a judgment against the city.
New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662, 731, 736 ; Police
Jury v. Foulhouze, 30 La. Ann. 64; Police Juryv. McCormack,
32 La. Ann. 624; Kleine v. Parishof Ascension, 33 La. Ann.
562; Leonard v. City of Brooklyn, 71 N. Y. 498.
Assuming the law to be as thus stated, the question in this
case is, what effect has this judgment under discussion upon
the rights of the parties?
The fact now alleged would have furnished in the chancery
suit but another ground or reason upon which to base the claim
of the city, that Klein had no right to sell the property under
his writ. In"other words, it would have been additional proof
of the cause of action set forth in that suit. The city would
have had the right to set that fact up in its bill and to -have
proved it on the trial, and, if proved, it would have been foundation for a judgment enjoining the sale of the property; but
the fact would have been nothing more than evidence of the
right of the city to obtain the injunction asked for in the chancery suit, and we think it was the duty of the city to set up in
that suit and ifo prove any and all grounds that it had to support the allegation that Klein had no right to seize or sell the
property.
The threatened sale might have been illegal for a number of
reasons, based upon widely divergent facts, but whatever those
reasons were, the facts upon which they rested were open to
proof in the chancery action, and if the city desired the benefit
of them, they should have been alleged and proved. It would
seem to be quite clear that the plaintiff could not be permitted
to prove each independent fact in a separate suit. Suppose
the city had only set up the fact of the registry of the judgment as a ground for enjoining the sale, and after a trial on
that issue it had been beaten and judgment had gone against
it, could the city after that have commenced another suit for
the same purpose, and set up as a ground for the alleged illegality of the sale the assignment of the judgment by Klein?
In such second action would not the judgment in the prior
action conclude the city? If not, then on being beaten on a
trial of that issue the city could commence still another action

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

based on the allegation that the judgment had been paid.
Thus, as many different actions as the city might allege grounds
for claiming the sale would be illegal could be maintained seriatim,and no one judgment would conclude the city except
as to the particular ground upon which the city proceeded in
each particular case. And yet all these different grounds
would simply form evidence upon' which the original cause of
action was based, namely, the alleged illegality of the apprehended sale. They would form simply separate facts upon
which the cause of action might rest. There is no difference
in the nature of the ground now urged in this case from the
other grounds actually set up in the chancery suit.
It is true that in the chancery suit the thing demanded was
an injunction restraining Klein from selling. the property, while
in this suit it is a decree declaring the sale effected by Klein
absolutely null and void. But the two demands, though different in terms, are in substance the same, and are founded
upon the same cause of action, viz., the total illegality of the
sale, whether threatened or accomplished. The demand in the
later action is simply altered to conform to the fact that there
had been a sale of the property, while the demand in the former suit was based upon the fact that there had not been a
sale, and the relief demanded was an injunction to prevent such
sale. In substance and effect the thing demanded is the same
in both cases.
It is contended, however, that the ground now urged for the
illegality of the sale, namely, a long prior dedication of the
property to public use, is of a totally different nature from the
grounds which were set up in the chancery suit; that the city
there appeared in a different capacity from that in which it
now appears, and that it was, therefore, unnecessary to allege
or prove this ground in that suit, and that a judgment in the
former suit in favor of the right of Klein to sell this property
does not conclude the city from proving that he had no such
right by reason of the character of the property sold. Although
the city has been more than fifteen years in discovering this
defence, yet, nevertheless, it is' now argued that a judgment
Against the city in the chancery suit being a judgment against

WERLEIN v. NEW ORLEANS.
Opinion of the Court.

it in a different capacity from that in which it appears in this
action as a trustee for the public, the rule applies in such a case
as it sometimes does in the case of a judgment against A B, in
relation to property held by him as executor or as trustee, which
would be no evidence for or against A B in his individual and
personal capacity. Collins v. Hydorn, 135 N. Y. 320. Although there are exceptions even to that rule. Morton v. Packwood, 3 La. Ann. 167; Fouchi v. Harrison,78 Georgia, 359.
We think there is no double capacity in this case, and that
the city appears in the same character and capacity in both
these suits, and that in this suit it is bound by the judgment in
the chancery suit.
The title to land which has been dedicated to public use, as
for a highway or public square in a city, is in the city as trustee
for the public, and it has been held, in the case of such a dedication of land in a proposed city, to be thereafter built, that the
fee will remain in abeyance until the proper grantee or city
comes in esse, when it will vest in such city. k dedication to
the public may exist where there is no city or town or corporate entity to take as grantee, and in such' case, while the fee
may remain in the individual who dedicates the land, he will be
estopped from setting it up as against the public who may be
interested in the use of the land according to its dedication.
Nevertheless, when a dedication is made in an existing city, the
city takes title as trustee. These statements are borne out by
the following cases: Pawlet v. Clark, 9 Cranch, 292; Beatty
v. Kurtz, 2 Pet. 566; Cincinnativ. White's Lessee, 6 Pet. 431,
435, 436; Barclay v. Howell's Lessee, 6 Pet. 498; New Orleans
v. United States, 10 Pet. 662; Police Jury v. Foulhouze, 30 La.
Ann. 64.
Although the city holds property of such nature in trust for
the public, that fact does not distinguish it from the character
or capacity in which the city holds its other property, so as to'
bring the case within the meaning of the rule, that a judgment
:against a man as an administrator does not bind him as an
individual. The' city holds all property which it owns, as
trustee for the public, although certain classes or kinds of property, such as the public streets, the public squares, the court

OCTOBElt TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

house and the jail, cannot be taken on execution against it, for
reasons which are plain to be seen. Such property is so necessary for the present and daily use of the city as the representative of the public, as well as for the use of the public itself,
that to allow it to be taken on execution against the city would
interfere so substantially with the immediate wants and rights
of the public whose trustee the city is, and also with the due
performance of the duties which are imposed upon the city by
virtue of its incorporation, that it ought not to be tolerated.
Other property which the city might hold, not being so situated,
might be taken on execution against it, but it nevertheless
holds that very property, as trustee. It holds it for the purpose
of discharging in a general way the duties which it owes to
the public, that is, to the inhabitants of the city. The citizens
or inhabitants of a city, not the common council or local'legislature, constitute the "corporation" of the city. 1 Dillon on
Municipal Corporations, 3d ed. sec. 40. The corporation as
slich has no human wants to be supplied. It cannot eat or
drink or wear clothing or live in houses. It must as to all its
property be the representative or trustee of somebody or of
some aggregation of persons, and it must, therefore, hold its
property for the same use, Call that use either public or private.
It is a use for the benefit of individuals. A municipal corporation is the trustee of the inhabitants of that corporation, and
it holds all its property in a general and substantial, although.
not in a strictly technical, sense in trust for them. They are
the people of the State inhabiting that particular subdivision
of its territory, a fluctuating class constantly passing out of the
scope of the trust by removal and death and as constantly renewed by fresh accretions of population. The property which
a municipal corporation holds is for their use and is held for
their benefit. Any of the property held by a city does not belong to the mayor, or to any or all of the members of the common council, nor to the common people as individual property.
If any'of those functionaries should appropriate the property
or its avails to his own use, he would be guilty of embezzlement, aid if one of the people not clothed with official station
should do the like, he would be guilty of larceny. So we see

WERLEIN v. NEW ORLEANS.
Opinion of the Court.

that whatever property a municipal corporation holds, it holds
it in trust for its inhabitants, in other words, for the public,
and the only difference in the trust existing in the case of a
public highway or a public square, and other cases, is that in
the one case the property cannot ,be taken in execution against
the city, while in other cases it may be. The right of the city
is less absolute in the one case than in'the other, but it owns
all the property in the same capacity and character as a corporation, and in trust for the inhabitants thereof. Views similar
to these have been heretofore substantially expressed. by the
late Judge Denio, in speaking for the Court of Appeals of New
York inDarllngtonv. Mayor, 31 N.. Y. 164.
From these considerations we are of opinion that there is no
difference in the character of the title by which a municipal'
corporation holds these two classes of property, but there is
simply a difference in the power which such corporation can
exercise over its property in the two cases. That difference
arises from the peculiar nature of the use of the property, which
in the one case requires it to be inalienable and not liable for
the debts of the city, while in the other case it is open both to
alienation and to sale under execution. In each case the character or capacity in which the city in fact holds the title is, the
same.
We, therefore, think the former judgment should have been
admitted in evidence upon the trial of this action. By that
judgment it conclusively appears that this property was legally.
sold upon the execution on Klein's judgment, and that the purchaser at the sale obtained a title which was good. This title
the plaintiff in error now owns, and it must prevail against
the claim of the city.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana must be
reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further
proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this court,
and it is so ordered.
M.R. JuSTICx MCKENA did not hear the argument, and took

no part in the decision of this case.
