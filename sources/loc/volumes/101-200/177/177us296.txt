duty which is strictly judicial in its nature. It would seem
strange that one having passed a civil service examination could
challenge the rating made by the commission, and ask the courts
to review such rating, thus transferring from the commission,
charged with the duty of examination, to the courts a function
which is, at least, more administrative than judicial; and if
courts should not be called upon to supervise the results of a
civil service examination equally inappropriate would be an investigation into the actual work done by the various clerks, a
comparison of one with another as to competency, attention to
duty, etc. These are matters peculiarly within the province of
those who are in charge of and superintending the departments,
and until Congress by some special and direct legislation makes
provision to the contrary, we are clear that they must be settled
by those administrative officers.
We see no error in the conclusions of the Court of Claims, and
its decree is

CONSOLIDATED CANAL COMPANY v. MESA CANAL
COMPANY.
APPEAAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF ARIZONA.
No. 200. Submitted March 15, 1900. - Decided April 9, 1900.

This court, in view of the finding of the court below as to the influence of
the dam placed by the Mesa Company upon the flow of water in the
canal of the Consolidated Company, is concluded as to the question of
fact.
An injunction will not issue to enforce a right that is doubtful, or to restrain an act, the injurious consequences of which are doubtful.
The dam built by the Mesa Company although it had the effect of raising
the flow of water in its canal so as to destroy the water power obtained
by fhe Consolidated Company through the construction of its canal, was
not an infringement of the rights secured to the Consolidated Company
under the contract set forth in the statement of the case.

THIS case comes on appeal from a decision of the Supreme
Court of the Territory of Arizona, 53 Pac. Rep. 575, affirming

CONSOLIDATED CANAL CO. v. MESA CANAL CO. 297
Statement of the Case.

a decree of the District Court of Maricopa County in favor of
the defendant in a suit brought by the appellant to restrain
the defendant from maintaining in its canal a dam in such a
way as to impede the flow of water in appellant's canal, or to
destroy a certain water power claimed byr appellant.
The facts as shown by the findings and statement prepared
by the Supreme Court are as follows: The appellee was the
owner of the Mesa Canal. On January 10, 1891, it made a
contract with A. J. Chandler, who subsequently transferred
his rights thereunder to the appellant. The material portions
of the contract are as follows:
"This article of agreement, made and entered into this 10th
day of January, A. D. 1891, by and between the Mesa Canal
Company, a corporation duly organized and legally existing
under and by virtue of the laws of the Territory of Arizona,
having its principal office and place of business at Mesa city in
the county of Maricopa and Territory of Arizona, party of the
first part, and A. J. Chandler of the city of Phoenix, in the
county and Territory aforesaid, party of the second part, witnesseth :
"That, whereas, the said party of the first part is an irrigating corporation, and as such is now the owner operating the
Mesa Canal in said county and Territory.
"And, whereas, said party of the second part desires to increase the size and capacity of said canal between the point in
Salt River where the water is now taken out, or by consent of
the directors of the Mesa Canal Company may hereafter be
taken out, and a point iii said Mesa Canal known as 'Ayers'
head gate,' so as to increase the flow of water through said
portions of said canal as aforesaid, and for the purpose of the
party of the second part, his associates and assigns, obtaining
water thereby through said canal, and in order to have the
said canal increased in size, dimensions and capacity without
cost or expense to said party of the first part, and without in
any way interfering with the rights, titles, interests nor privileges
of said party of the first part in and to said canal and the water
flowing through said canal, except as hereinafter provided.

CONSOLIDATED CANAL CO. v. MESA CANAL CO. 301
Statement of the Case.

The appellant, as the trahsferee from Chandler, enlarged and
reconstructed the Mesa Canal down to a place called the "Division Gates," which point had by mutual consent been substituted for Ayers' head gate as the point of division of the waters,
and delivery by the appellant to the appellee of the water to
which the latter was entitled. In thus enlarging and reconstructing the canal the appellant raised the grade thereof for
the purpose of carrying the water at a higher elevation, thereby
enabling the canal to cover more and other lands, and at the
point where the division gates were located the elevatioh was
about five feet above the grade of the canal before reconstruction, and by the construction of those gates at that point the
appellant delivering the water to the appellee secured a fall of
five feet in the water thus delivered.
Other findings were as follows:
"After appellant had delivered the water in the manner
aforesaid for some years, the appellee built a dam in its canal
a short distance below the division gates that raised the water
and caused it to flow through a lateral ditch, which enabled
the appellee to irrigate some lands on which it had not been
able to place water through its canal from its former elevation. The effect of this raise in the water was to reduce the
fall at the division gates.
."After appellee had built its dam and backed up the water,
as aforesaid appellant had constructed a water wheel and a mill
for grinding grain to be driven thereby, and had erected them
at the division gates, so that the wheel was turned by the water
as it fell from the division gate into the Mesa Canal, a distance
of about live feet. Afterwards appellant increased the height
of the dam that it had formerly built to such an extent that it
raised the surface of the water and backed the same up against
the division gate in such manner as to destroy three and one
half feet of the five feet fall and totally destroyed the water
power.
"The water raised by the dam and the water affording the
water power thus destroyed is the 7000 inches of water which
appellant is obligated by the terms of the agreement afore-

mentioned to first deliver to the appellee before said appellant
is entitled to receive or use any water through said canal.
"A further result of the erection of the water in appellee's
canal below the division gates was to very slightly, if at all,
impede the flow of water in appellant's canal above the division gates and thereby detract very slightly from the carrying
capacity of appellant's canal.
"The cost of the reconstruction of the canal from Ayers'
head gate to the division gates exceeded ten thousand dollars,
and the water power created at the fall was equal to about
forty horse power."

MR. JUSTicE BREWER,

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
While the title to any portion of the Mesa Canal may not
have been changed bir this contract, yet for convenience we
shall speak of that portion thereof under the control of the
appellant as its canal, and of the balance as the appellee's canal.
In view of the finding of the Supreme Court we need not
stop to consider any question in respect to the influence of the
danr placed by appellee upon the flow of water in appellant's
canal, and this notwithstanding the fact that in the trial of
the case much of the testimony, pro and con, was in reference
to that matter. We are concluded as to the question of fact
by the finding, and it is familiar law that injunction will not
issue to enforce a right that is doubtful, or to restrain an act
the injurious consequences of which are merely trifling. Parker v. Winnipiseogee Lake Company, 2 Black, 545, 552.
We pass, therefore, to the only substantial question, which is,
whether the dam built by appellee, having the effect as it did
of raising the flow of water in its canal so as to destroy the
water pQwer obtained by appellant through the construction of

CONSOLIDATED CANAL CO. v. MESA CANAL CO. 303
Opinion of the Court.

its canal, was an infringement of the rights secured to appellant
by the contract of January 10, 1891. The appellant seems to
be of the opinion that by that contract it had a right to raise
its canal to such an elevation as it saw fit while the appellee
had no such liberty. We search the contract in vain for any
express stipulation to that effect. If the appellant had a right
to raise the grade of its canal five feet, we see nothing to forbid
the appellee to raise its grade to the same height. There is no
reference in the contract to water power. Obviously the only
matter then contemplated was. a supply of water fok irrigation
purposes. The appellee is styled "an irrigating corporation,
and as such . . . operating the Mesa Canal." The expressed purpose of appellant -was "obtaining water therieby
through said canal." The water power was evidently an afterthought, suggested by the condition of things when the appellant had finished the reconstruction of its canal. The appellant
must point to some stipulation in the contract which the action
of the appellee has broken, for the entire right given by it to the
appellant is declared to be "without in any way interfering
with the rights, titles, interests or privilege of said party of the
first part in and to said canal, and the water flowing through
said canal, except as hereinafter provided."
No right passed to the appellant except that which was expressly named. All other rights, titles, interests or privileges
were retained by the appellee. The appellant was to dliver
the 7000 inches of water out of the enlarged canal, and the appellee was to receive and pay therefor. The appellant was to
increase the carrying capacity of the canal not less than 10,000
nor more than 40,000 inches, and this surplus water it had a
right to use. But the appellee reserved the right if it saw fit
at any time to still further enlarge the carrying capacity of the
canal, and the only limitation in respect to such enlargement
was that it should not "interfere with or lessen the rights"
granted to the appellant. What were those rights? Obviously
the right to take and use the surplus over 7000 inches of water
flowing through the canal, as enlarged by appellant.
It may be that neither party to this contract could change
the grade of its canal so as to compel the other to wake a like,

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

change of grade. Thus, when the appellant, in the first instance, enlarged and reconstructed its canal, it raised the grade
five feet. If it had seen fit to lower the grade five feet, instead
of raising it, doubtless in order to fulfil its contract of delivery
it would have had to provide some pumping arrangements, and
could not have demanded that the appellee lower its grade five
feet in order to receive the water. And so it may be that the
appellee could not now raise its grade tenfeet and then demand
that the appellant either raise its grade five feet more or put in
pumping works to insure the delivery of the water. But as to
any action which does not interfere with the delivery of water
by the appellant to the appellee, there is nothing in the contract
to restrain at least the appellee from doing as it pleases with
its canal.
It does not appear that the appellee was acting maliciously
and for the mere sake of injuring the appellant. On the contrary, its purpose as disclosed was to irrigate lands which it had
not theretofore been able to irrigate from its former elevation,
and we know of no reason why it had not a right to do so. It
made no stipulation as to the lands which it should irrigate.
It had the same right which it had before the contract of enlarging or reducing the number of acres reached by the flow of
its water. It does not appear that the lands which it was seeking to irrigate by raising the elevation in the upper part of its
canal could have been reached in any other way, and it was
not bound to desist from any enlargement of its own business
for the mere benefit of the appellant or to enable the latter to
enjoy something which was not conveyed to it by the terms of
the contract.
We need not stop to inquire what are the rights of separate
appropriators of water, in the absence of a contract. We are
dealing with those which grow out of this contract, bearing in
mind that all rights are reserved to the appellee which are
not in terms granted to the appellant. If 7000 inches of water
was more than sufficient to supply the territory which it was
then irrigating, there is nothing which forbade the appellee
to enlarge that area, and in order to enable it to reach that
larger area it might make any change in the construction of

its canal-at least any change which did not interfere with the
free delivery of the water by the appellant.
We see no error in the decision of the Supreme Court of Arizona, and its judgment is
Apirmed.
