ADAMS v. COWEN.
CERTIORARI TO THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH
CIRCUIT.

No. 113 of October Term, 1898. Argued January 10, 11, 1900.-Decided April 16, 1900.

Thomas W. Means died in 1890, leaving a large estate, and a will made some
ten years before his death, containing, among other provisions, the following: "Item 4. I give, devise and bequeath all the residue and remainder of my estate, personal, real and mixed, wherever situated or
located, of which I shall die possessed, to be equally divided among my
four children, John Means, William Means, Mary A. Adams, and Margaret A. Means, and my grandson, Thomas M. Culbertson (son and sole
heir of my deceased daughter Sarah Jane Culbertson) who shall be living
at the time of my decease, and the issue of any child now living, and of
said grandson, who may then have deceased, such issue taking the share
to which such child or grandson Would be entitled if living. But said
share given, devised and bequeathed to said grandson or his issue is to
be held in trust as hereinafter provided, and to be subject to the provisions hereinafter contained as to said grandson's share. "Item 5. I
have made advances to my said children which are charged to them respectively on my books, and I may make further advances to them respectively, or to some of them, and to my said grandson, which may be
charged on my books to their respective accounts. I desire the equal
provision, herein made for said children, and the provision for said grandson, to be a provision for them respectively, in addition to said advances
made and that may hereafter be made, and that in the division, distribution and settlement of my said estate, said advances made and that may
hereafter be made, be treated not as advances, but as gifts not in any
manner to be accounted for by my said children and grandson, or any of
them or the issue of any of them." lie was in the habit of advancing
money to his children, the amounts advanced to each individually being
entered against him in the father's books. At the date of the will the
several amounts so advanced were as follows: John, $79,214.36; William,
$58,409.54; Mrs. Adams, $51,207.48; Margaret, $39,120.78; Mrs. Culbertson, $29,609.82. Subsequently, in 1898, William becoming involved, the
amount advanced to him was largely increased in manner as set forth in
the statement of the case and opinion of the court. After the death of
the father a claim was made that the money thus paid out for William
was to be held to be a part of his share of his father's estate. Held:
(1) That in the absence of some absolute and controlling rule to the contrary, the intentions of a testator, as deduced from the language of
the will, construed in the light of the circumstances surrounding

him at the date of its execution, always control as to the disposition of the estate;
(2) That the testator believed that after le had done in his lifetime what,
in his judgment, his children severally required, there would be an
abundance of his estate left for distribution, and intended that all
dealings between himself and each of his children should be wiped
out, and that what was left after having discharged to each his paternal obligation should be distributed equally.
After the probate of his father's will, William gave to the administrators
of the estate with the will annexed, an acknowledgment of the receipt
from them of $136,035.75 in his own notes to his father as part of his
distributive share of his father's estate. At the time when this was done
he was in 'straitened circumstances, was broken in spirit and was
wavering in his purposes. Held, that while a man in the ftill possession
of his faculties and under no duress may give away his property, and
equity will not recall the gift, yet it looks with careful scrutiny upon all
transactions between trustee and beneficiary, and if -it
appears that the
trustee has taken any advantage of the situation of the beneficiary, and
has obtained from him, even for only the benefit of other beneficiaries,
large property without consideration, it will refuse to uphold the transaction thus accomplished; and that the conclusions of the Circuit Court
of Appeals in this case must be sustained, and its decree affirmed.
ON November 16, 1891, the respondents, trustees for the wife
and children of William Means, filed their bill inthe Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Kentucky against
the petitioners as administrators (with the will annexed) of
Thomas W. Means, deceased, and John Means, a son of said
Thomas W. Means. The case passed to hearing in that court
upon pleadings and proofs, and resulted in a decree, on July 31,
1895, in favor of the defendants, dismissing the bill. From such
dismissal the plaintiffs appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit, which court, on February 8, 1897, reversed
the decree of dismissal, and entered a decree in favor of the
plaintiffs. 47 U. S. App. 439-676.' On May 24, 1897, a petition
was filed in this court for a certiorari, which was allowed, and
on December 6, 1897, the certiorari and return were duly filed.
At the October term, 1898, of this court, after argument and on
May 22, 1899, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals was
affirmed by a divided court.' Thereafter upon petition a rehearing was ordered, and the case was argued at the present term
before a full bench.

ADAMS 7'- COWEN.
Statement of the Case.

The facts are these: Thomas W. Means, a resident of Ashland, Kentucky, died there on June 8, 1890, leaving an estate
consisting chiefly of personal property, which was appraised
(including the notes of his son, William Means, for $136,035.75)
at $752,302.44. He left four children, John Means, William
Means, Margaret A. Means and Mary A. Adams, and one grandson, Thomas M. Culbertson, the only child' of a deceased daughter. Some ten years prior to his death, and on July 20, 1880,
he made a will, in which, after provisions for the payment of
his debts, funeral expenses and expenses of administration, were
these two items:
"Item 4. I give, devise and bequeath all the residue and remainder of my estate, personal, real and mixed, wherever situated
or located, of which I shall die possessed, to be equally divided
among my four children, John Means, William Means, Mary A.
Adams, and Margaret A. Means, and my grandson, Thomas M.
Culbertson (son and sole heir of my deceased daughter Sarah
Jane Culbertson) who shall be living at the time of my decease,
and the issue of any child now living, and of said grandson, who
may then have deceased, such issue taking the share to which
such child or grandson would be entitled if living. But said
share given, devised and bequeathed to said grandson or his
issue is to be held in trust as hereinafter provided, and to be subject to the provisions hereinafter contained as to said grandson's
share.
"Item 5. I have made advances to my said children which
are charged to them respectively on my books, and I may make
further advances to them respectively, -or to some of them, and
to my said grandson, which may be charged on my books to
their respective accounts. I desire the equal provision, herein
made for said children, and the provision for said grandson, to
be a provision for them respectively, in addition to said advances made and that may hereafter be made, and that in the
division, distribution and settlement of. my said estate, said
advances made and that may hereafter be made, be treated not
as advances, but as gifts not in any manner to be accounted for
by my said children and grandson, or any of them or the issue
of any of them."

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Statement of the Case.

Thomas W. Means was a prosperous iron manufacturer, who
had, as stated, accumulated in his lifetime a large estate. For
many years he had been in the habit of letting his children have
money. This he had been doing for at least twenty-five years
before the making of the will. This money was not given to
them in equal sums at regular or irregular intervals. In other
words, he was not making a partial, and equal distribution of
his estate in advance of his death, but the money was paid to
or for one or another of his children as occasion seemed to call
for it. Accounts were entered with each of these children in
his books, and the money thus paid to or for them was charged
against them in these accounts, so that upon the face of the
books they stood as debtors to him for the amounts so charged.
The amounts thus charged were sometimes large. The accounts
were often reduced by money or property returned to the father.
So the father dealt separately with each child, letting him or her
have money whenever in his judgment the interest of the child
called for it. He was helping them in their business, paying
their debts and otherwise using his large properties for their
benefit. At the same time the accounts were kept in his books
in such a way as to indicate that he retained a claim against
each child for the balance shown on such account. He made
memoranda on his books, such as this at the head of John's
account: "This account and the accounts of William Means
and Mary A. Adams are not to be charged with interest when
final settlement is made, or at any time. Thomas W., Means."
With that as the relation between himself and children, Thomas
W. Means made the will containing the two items above quoted.
He was then seventy-seven years old. At the date of the will
the accounts showed the following debtor balances:
John ..................................... $79,214
W illiam............................. ....58,409
Mrs. Adams ............................... 51,207
Margaret .................................. 39,120
Mrs. Culbertson ........................... 29,609

Opinion of the Court.

relieve him from the embarrassment and dangers which threatened by reason of such failure, a large sum of money was paid
out by Thomas W. Means for William's benefit. The question
presented in this case is whether the money thus paid out is to
be held a part of William's share of his father's estate, or
whether it is to be deducted from the estate and the division
made of the balance between the five legatees.

Anderson and Mr. John F. Hager were on his brief.
Mr. John J. Glidden and Mr. Jzdson Harmon for Cowen.
Mr. H. P. Whitaker and Mr.John -Little were on their brief.
MR.JUSTIcE BrREWER, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
The primary question is upon the construction of the fifth
item of the will of Thomas W. Means. If there had been no
such item of course all sums due from the children and grandchild to the father and grandfather would be part of the property of his estate and to be counted in determining the sum to
be divided among the five in accordance with item four. But
item five evidently contemplated that some amounts were to be
deducted from the gross sum of the decedent's property before
a division was to be made. What were those deductions?
What did the testator intend should be deducted? For, in the
absence of some absolute and controlling rule of law to the contrary, the intentions of a testator, as deduced from the language
of the will, construed in the light of the circumstances surrounding him at the date of its execution, always control as to the
disposition of the estate. Without entering into any discussion"
we make these quotations from prior decisions of this court. In
Smith v. Bell, 6 Pet. 68, it was said by Chief Justice Marshall:
"The first and great rule in the exposition of wills, to which
all other rules must bend, is that the intention of the testator
expressed in his will shall prevail, provided it be consistent with
the rules of law. 1 Doug. 322; 1 W. Bi. 672. This principle

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

is generally asserted in the construction of every testamentary
disposition. It is emphatically the will of the person who makes
it, and is defined to be ' the legal declaration of a man's intentions which he wills to be performed after his death.' 2 B1.
Com. 499. These intentions are to be collected from his words
and ought to be carried into effect if they be consistent with law.
In the construction of ambiguous expressions, the situation of the
parties may very properly be taken into view. The ties which
connect the testator with his legatees, the affection subsisting
between them, the motives which may reasonably be supposed
to operate with him, and to influence him in the disposition of
his property, are all entitled to consideration in expounding
doubtful words and ascertaining the meaning in which the testator used them.

standing the reasonableness and good sense of this general rule,
that the intention shall prevail, it hag been sometimes disregarded. If the testator attempts to effect that which the law
forbids, his will must yield to the rules of law. But courts
have sometimes gone farther. The construction put upon the
words in one will has been supposed to furnish a rule for construing the same words in other wills; and thereby to furnish
some settled and fixed rules of construction which ought to be
respected. We cannot say that this principle ought to be totally
disregarded; it should never be carried so far as to defeat the
plain intent; if that intent may be carried into execution without violating the rules of law. It has been said truly, (3 Wils.
141,) ' that cases on wills may guide us to general rules of construction; but unless a case cited be in every respect directly in
point, and agree in every circumstance, it will have little or no
weight with the court, who always look upon the intention of
the testator as the polar star to direct them in the construction
of wills.'"

And in Blake v. Hawkins, 98 U. S. 315, 324, Mr. Justice
Strong used these words:
"It is a common remark, that, when interpreting a will, the
attending circumstances of the testator, such as the condition

ADAMS v. COWEN.
Opinion of the Court.

of his family, and the amount and character of his property,
may and ought to be taken into consideration. The interpreter
'may place himself in the position occupied by the testator when
he made the will, and from that standpoint discover what was
intended."
See also Clark v. Boorman'8 Execrtors, 18 Wall. 493; Colton
v. Colton, 127 U. S. 300; Lee v. Simjson, 134 U. S.572.
In the light of these decisions we turn to inquire what was
the intention of the testator? Suppose that on the next day
after making this will he had died, upon what basis would the
distribution of his estate have been made? Obviously by first
cancelling all the gifts and advances made to his children, and
then distributing the balance equally between the five. For he
declares that the equal provision made by item four shall be in
addition to his advances, "and that in the division, distribution
and settlement of my said estate said advances . . . be
treated not as advances, but as gifts not in any manner to be
accounted for by my said children and grandson, or any of them,
or the issue of any of them." Language could not be more
clear. Nothing could express the intent of the testator more
forcibly than these words. Whatever he had done in the way
of letting his children and grandson have money was to be taken
as a matter of gift, for which none of the recipients was to account, and only his estate, less such gifts and advances, was to
be equally distributed between the legatees named. And this
intent, which is so clearly disclosed, in respect to what he had
already done, is equally clear in respect to what he might do
thereafter. He says that he "may make further advances to
them respectively, or to some of them," and declares that in the
division, distribution and settlement of his estate "said advances
that may hereafter be made, be treated, not as advances,
. .
but as gifts." In other words, as he had used some of his property in the past again and again to help his children, he saw that
it was likely in the future he might do the same thing, and declared not only that every dollar he had let them have in the past,
but also every dollar that he might let them have in the future
should be taken, "not as advances, but as gifts." Not only that,
but that such gifts should not be accounited for in any manner

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

by any of the recipients, and that only the balance of his estate,
after all these personal gifts were cancelled, should be distributed
equally among the legatees. As in the past he had freely used
his estate for the benefit of his children, so he announced his
intention to deal as freely with it in the future, and to use any
part of it in any way that he might deem best for the interests
of any one of his children, and declared that such help given,
or that might be given in the future, should not be made the
basis of any accounting between his legatees. lie knew he had
a large estate, and that, whatever he might do with a fraction
of it, there would be an abundance left for each of them enough to place them beyond the reach of want. He had the
large and generous paternal feeling; that feeling which prompts
the parent to care as best he can during his lifetime for each of
his children according to their respective wants, and he did not
mean that anything he did for one child should be challenged
by another. He doubtless recalled, as every parent does, that
during infancy and childhood one child lad called for more attention and care, more hours of toil and watch, than another.
le realized that as they had grown to manhood and womanhood, and entered into their various places in life, there had
been different calls for pecuniary assistance, and that doubtless
there would be differences in the future. Ile knew that he had
responded to every need of each child in its early days, was
trying in the later days of manhood and womanhood to make
like responses, and felt that while life should be prolonged to
him he would be under the same pressure of affection to each.
He believed that after he had done in his lifetime what in his
judgment they severally required there would be an abundance
of his estate left for distribution, and intended that all dealings
between himself and each of his children should be wiped out
-there should be a tabula rasa- and that what was left (and
it would be a large estate) after having discharged to each one
his paternal obligation, the untouched estate should be distributed equally. We do not see how that purpose and thought of
his could be expressed more clearly and forcibly than it was done
in the fifth item of the will, and it would.be a sad commentary
on the wisdom of the law if that purpose was not recognized
and enforced.

ADAMS v. COWEN.
Opinion of the Court.

It is said that there is an expressed limitation on this generous purpose in that he describes the advances already made as
charged to them respectively on my books," and that as to
further advances they "may be charged on my books to their
respective accounts," and that in order that any subsequent
advances should come within the scope of this provision they
should be formally charged on his books "to their respective
accounts." We cannot believe that the generous purposes of
the father were intended to be limited by the action of a bookkeeper. In the full possession of his faculties and watchful
over his books he knew what entries had been made, and that
they told the full story of his advances to his children, and so,
not unnaturally, he referred to those books as evidence of those
advances, but as to future advances he says only that they "may
be charged on my books," and surely he did not make the possibilities of such entries the measure of his generosity. He was
77 years of age when this will was made. He could not foresee the length of days which might be allotted to him nor the
possible failure of any of his faculties-and indeed before his
death there was a failure of eyesight, and possibly, towards
the last, of his mental powers. Of course, when he made this
will he knew the possibility of these things, and it is inconsistent with the whole spirit of the will to suppose that he meant
that his generosity should be determined and measured by the
fidelity or forgetfulness of a mere clerk. No man acting in a
spirit of generous affection ever contemplates that a stranger
shall measure the scope and reach of such affection. It is a
matter personal to himself, the beginning and ending of which,
the scope and limits of which, he and he only is to determine.
With this understanding of the scope and purpose of this
clause in the will, we pass to a consideration of what took place
in respect to the advances for the benefit of his son William.
At that time the father was feeling the weaknesses of old age,
his eyesight was failing, and le had called his son John to act
as his agent in the care of his estate. News of the disaster to
the bank and the effect of its failure on the welfare of his son
William came to the father, and John went to Cincinnati to
investigate, came back and reported the situation as he had

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

found it; told his father of the personal loans made to William
by the bank, and that they were secured by collateral. We
quote his testimony as to the conversation with his father:
"Q. 832. What communication did you have with your father
upon your return to Ashland ?
'.'A. I told him of William's debt to the bank-individual
alebt-and what it would probably amount to, and that friends
here advised it was for William's interest that that debt, individual debt, should be paid. I told him that the securities
which William had turned over to the bank as security on the
debt would some of them probably be sacrificed at a sale here
-that I thought we had better pay the debt.
"Q. 833. What did he say ?
"A. Ile said that he was satisfied to do whatever I thought
was best.
"Q. 834. What else did lie say about the matter other than
to say to you that he was satisfied to do whatever you thought
l
was best
"A. Well, I think I have answered it. I cannot repeat the conversation between us any more than give the general result of it."
On the faith of this conversation John returned to Cincinnati,
and having raised the needed money,paid off William's obligations to the bank and took up the collateral, whose face value
was largely in excess of the indebtedness. That the collateral
when properly utilized, as it apparently was, did not pay the
amount of William's indebtedness to the bank, is immaterial,
nor is it material that William gave a note for the amount of
this advance, as well as other notes afterwards for like advances,
and that such notes were entered on the books of the father in
the account of "bills receivable." It appears that this payment
was not made at the request of William, but made upon consultation between the father and his son and agent, John, and
made probably with the expectation that the collateral, if properly used, would pay the amount of the indebtedness.
And here it becomes important to consider the relations of
John. Means to his father. As the father grew old and his
faculties began to fail he naturally called his oldest son John
into his service, and John acted during the last years of his
father's life as his agent, and it was really at John's suggestion

ADAMS v. COWEN.
Opinion of the Court.

that the money was advanced for the benefit of William. But
in calling John to his service as agent and caretaker of his
property there is nothing to indicate that the father meant that
the son should do anything to prevent the full carrying out of
the purpose expressed in his will. He had no express authority,
and indeed no implied authority to alter that instrument in
which had long been recorded the settled determination of the
father. So that whatever he may have done in caring for the
property as the agent of his father during his lifetime is not to
be taken, unless there are other circumstances to indicate the
fact, as showing an intent on the part of the father to change
in any way the scope and effect of the will.
And indeed it is but simple justice to John Means to say that
from the evidence we are satisfied that there was no thought
or intent on his part to change or limit his father's will. He
did not intend by any strategy or device to thwart his father's
purpose of kindness to any of his children, nor did he pursue
the course he did in respect to this advance with the idea that
he could satisfy his father's desire to help William and at the
same time place the act of help outside the reach of item five of
the will, and thus advance the pecuniary interest of himself and
the other legatees not thus helped by his father. Very likely he
was uncertain as to the construction which would be placed
upon item five; possibly thought that even if it meant exactly
that which we are clear it does mean, there might be an impropriety at his father's age and feebleness in his advancing so
much money for the benefit of a single child, and in order that
the transaction, in case of his death before that of his father,
might be clearly disclosed, took notes from William and entered
them on his father's books under the head of "bills receivable."
It appears from some of the testimony that there was also a
thought of protecting William's share in the estate which by,
the death of the father might soon come to him, from attacks
of creditors, and it may also be that partly on that account
William executed the notes which were received for these
moneys. At any rate, the correspondence between the brothers
at the time of these transactions indicates that they were friendly,
and that John was willingly doing that which he thought the

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

father desired in using a portion of the father's estate in helping William out of his troubles. But whatever John or William may have purposed or thought, the evidence does not
indicate that the father intended that this help extended to
William should stand in any different attitude to that which he
had theretofore extended to others of his children, or meant
that this advance should not come within the scope of the provisions in item five; and that is the fundamental question in the
case. It is the father's estate which is being distributed, and
it is the duty of the courts to see that it is distributed according to his expressed intention.
The testimony in this case is voluminous, and there are many
facts and circumstances disclosed in it throwing light on the
questions w.hich we have considered. We have deemed it unnecessary to refer to them in view of the very full and satisfac-

tory opinion filed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, in which
these facts and circumstances are recited and considered at
length, and which in the main meets our approval.
One further question remains for consideration: The father
died June 8, 1890. The will was duly probated, and administrators with the will annexed were appointed and qualified.
On October 16, 1890, William Means executed and delivered to
these administrators the following receipt:
"AsHILAND,

KY., October 16, 1890.

"Received of Thomas M. Adams and E. C. Means, administrators with the will annexed of the estate of Thomas W. Means,
deceased, the sum of one hundred and thirty-six thoushnd and
thirty-five and 75-100 dollars, being a part of my distributable
share as legatee under said will applied by them as ordered by
me upon the following notes and claims owed by me to the estate
of said decedent, and payable to his order, viz:"
[Here follows description of ten notes, with balance due on
each, aggregating $136,035.75.]
"This receipt is given in pursuance of settlement made October 6, i890.
"Attest: JoHN F. HAGER,
"A, E. I4AM roN."

"WILLIAM IVIEANS,

ADAMS v. COWEN.
Opinion of the Court.

The validity of this receipt or release was challenged by the
respondents, (plaintiffs in the Circuit Court,) who claimed title
to that portion of the estate of Thomas W. Means passing under
the will to William Means by virtue of the following proceedings : At the May term, 1891, of the Common Pleas Court of
the county of Greene, State of Ohio, a decree was entered in a
cause then pending in said court between William Means on the
one side and on the other Martha E. C. Means, his wife, and
their children, Gertrude E. Means and Pearl E. Means and Patti
Means, a minor, by her next friend, her mother, which, after
finding that in the lifetime of Thomas W. Means, for a good
and valuable consideration, William Means made an agreement
with his wife and children whereby he settled upon them,
through trustees, for their maintenance and support, his interest in expectancy in the estate of his father, Thomas W. Means,
transferred all such interest to the plaintiffs as trustees. This
decree having been entered after personal service upon William
Means, of course binds him both by its findings and order. How
far the findings in such decree as to the agreement and the time
at which it was made may affect the action of the administrators is a matter discussed in the briefs, but vhich we deem it
unnecessary to consider.
Neither do we stop to consider the charge of fraudulent conduct on the part of the administrators, for independently of
those considerations we are of opinion that equity will not enforce this receipt or release. It was a surrender by William
Means, without any consideration, of practically his whole interest in his father's estate, amounting to between $100,000 and
$200,000. The administrators Were acting in a fiduciary capacity. Their obligations to each of the beneficiaries were equal.
Their duty was to dispose of the property placed in their hands
according to the expressed will of the testator, and they were
not at liberty to act in the interests of one legatee as against
those of another. If they were doubtful as to the meaning of
any clause in the will they should have applied to the court for
its construction and direction. If they chose to act upon their
own interpretation of its meaning they should have so acted,
and not sought to conclude any of the legatees by a coatract

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

binding him to accept their interpretation. As shown by papers
introduced in evidence, signed by William Means, they proceeded with more than promptness and with great activity and
energy to secure this and other releases. Obviously William
Means was in such a condition as to require that they who were
in fact trustees of his interests should seek to protect instead of
destroying them. We think the evidence justifies that which
was said by the Court of Appeals in its opinion:
"William had lost all his property, and was in very straitened bircumstances. Since his downfall he has been broken in
spirit and wavering in his purposes. He seems at times to have
been impressed that the administrators had a moral, if not a
legal, claim upon him, that he should yield up his legacy to the
estate, and this claim was pressed and insisted upon by the administrators. That they had no such legal claim upon him, we
have already determined. His brother and sisters all being in
affluent circumstances, and his own family in needy circumstances, that he should have voluntarily given up the whole of
this large sum, with no mistake in regard to what his legal
rights were, it is difficult to believe. It amounted simply to a
gift to the administrators for the benefit of the other legatees,
whose only claim rested on the bounty of the-testator. Courts
of equity view such transactions with distrust, and if the circumstances indicate that the trustee has dealt with the beneficiary unjustly, will not hesitate to set them aside. The absence of any adequate consideration in itself raises a presumption
of unfairness, which the trustee is bound to repel."
While a man in the full possession of his faculties and under
no duress may give away his property, and equity will not recall the gift, yet it looks with careful scrutiny upon all transactions between trustee and beneficiary, and if it appears that
the trustee has taken any advantage of the situation of the beneficiary, and has obtained from him, even for only the benefit of
