-Submitted December 7, 196.-Decided December 20, 1836.

In a bond "in the penal sum of .10,000, liquidated damages," with condition
that certain third persons shall within a year release the obligee from a
large Dumber of debts held by them severally, and varying from .8000 to
.l10each, the sum of $10,000 is apenalty, and not liquidated damages; and
in an action thereon the obligee, upon proof that hone of those debts
were released by the holders'within the year, but that immediately afterwards he was discharged from all of them in bankruptcy, can recover
nominal damages only.

This was an action brought in September, 1881, by a citizen
of Missouri against a citizen of New York upon the following
bond, signed and sealed by the defendan*t :
"Know all men that I, James H=. Gould, of Seneca Falls,
New York, am held and firmly bound to Moses C. Bignall in
the penal sum of ten thousand dollars lawful money, liquidated
damages, to the payment of which I bind myself, my heirs,
executors, administrators and assigns, firmly by these presents.
"Sealed with my seal at the city of St. "Louis and State of
Missouri this 7th day of April, A.D. 1879.
"The condition of this obligation is such that whereas on
the 1st day of April, 1878, the said Moses C. Bign'all became
unable to pay and satisfy all his just debts and liabilities; and
whereas the Gould Manufacturing Company, of Seneca Falls
aforesaid, was one of the creditors of the said Moses C. Bignall;
and whereas the said Gould Mfanufacturing 'Company, Mrs.
Hannah B. Gould, of Seneca Falls, and Angus McDonald, of
'Rochester, New York, became the assignees by purchase of a
large number and amount of the said debts' and claims then
existing against the said Ioses C. Bigmall; and whereas said
last named parties, or either of them, may deem it to their interest to become the assignees of other of said debts and claims
now existing against said Moses C. Bignall:

"Now, therefore, if the said Gould Manufacturing Com
pany, the said Hannah B. Gould, and the said Angus McDonald, shall acquit, release and discharge the said Moses C.
Bignall, within one year from the date hereof, of all and singular the debts and claims aforesaid, thht have been assigned to
them, dr that may heieafter be assigned to them, or either of
them, by good and sufficient reledse in writing, to be made by
them, and to be delivered by them to said Moses C. Bignall,,
then this obligation to be void; otherwise, it shall remain in
full force and virtue."
The petition alleged that the defendant executed the bond
at its date; that the plaintiff was then owing to divers persons
debts amounting to about $50,000, including one to the Gould
Manufacturing Company of about $7000, and that Hannah B.
Gould held assignments from different persons of many of
those debts, to the amount of about $26,000 (a list of ten of
which was annexed, varying from $147.23 to $8117.00), and
Angus M cDonald held assignments of like debts to the amount
of about $6000 (a list of thirteen of which was annexed, varying from $9.80 to $1445.52); that there had been a breach of
the bond, in that mbre than a year had elapsed since its execution yet neither the Gould Manufacturing Company nor Gould
nor McDonald had acquitted, released or discharged the plaintiff from any of those debts, and that by reason of this breach
the plaintiff had been damaged in the sum of $10,000.
The answer admitted these allegations, except that it denied
that the plaintiff had been damaged in the sum of $10,000 or
any other suni; and alleged that the plaintiff, under proceedings in bankruptcy pending at the date of the bond, had since
obtained a certificate of discharge, whereby all his debts men.tioned in the p6tition were discharged. The plaintiff filed a
replication, denying all the allegations of the answer.
Upon a tri by the court, a jury having duly been waived,
the plaintiff proved that the assets which came to the hands
'of his assigne~n bankruptcy amounted to $23,109.54, and.no
more, of which S17,439.11 was collected of the Gould Manufacturing Company, and that the only dividend paid was on
March 14, 1882, of 16A cents on the dollar. The plaintiff

admitted in open court that he obtained a-certificate of discharge on May 6, 1880, under proceedings in banlkuptcy
begun on April 25, 1878. The defendant relied on this adnis
sion, and introduced no evidence. No other testimony wa,
given nor admissions made at the trial, save those contained
in the pleadings.
The plaintiff asked the court to declare the following propositions of law as applicable to this case: "1st. The bond
sued on is a liquidated bona, and the breach being admitted
by the defendant, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the liquidated sum, $10,000.; 2d. If the bond is not a liquidated bond,
still, under the issues and the evidence, the plaintiff 'is entitled
to recover more than nominal damages, notwithstanding his
ischarge in bankruptcy." The court reffused thus to declare
the law, and-rendered judgment for the plaintiff, and assessed
his damages at one cent only. The plaintiff excepted to the
ruling and action of the court, and sued out this writ of error.

VOL. CxIx-32

OCTOBER TERM, 188.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JusTo' GRAY, after stating the case as above reported,

delivered the opinion of the court.
By the rules now established, at law as well as in equity,
-the sum of $10,000, named in this bond, is a penalty only,
and not liquidated damages. As observed by Lord Tenterden
in a similar case, "whoever framed this agreement does not
appear to have had any very clear idea of the distinction between a penalty and liquidated damages; for the sum" in
question "is described in the same sentence as a penal sum
and as liquidated damages." Davies v. Penton,, 6 B. & C. 216,
222; S. C. 9 D. & IR.369, 376. The object of the bond is to
secure the obligee's discharge from a large number of claims
against him, held by .certain third persons severally, amounting in all to something like $39,000, and varying from more
than $8000 to less than $10 each. A failure of either of
those persons to release any one of those claims would be a
breach of the bond; and for any such breach a just compensation might be estimated in damages. The sum of $10,000
must therefore be regarded as simply a penalty to secure the
payment of such damages as the obligee may suffer from any
breach of the bond. WIatts v. Camois, 115 U. S. 353; Boys
v. Aneell, 5 Bing. N. C. 390; S. C. 7 Scott, 364; Tlionsoy v.
Hvdson, L. R. 4 H. L. 1, 30; Fisk v. Gray, 11 Allen, 132.
Upon the evidence introduced and the admissions made by
the plaintiff at the trial, it does 'not appear that he suffered
any damage whatevor. Although there was a technical
breach of the bond at the expiration of a year from its date,
by the third persons therein named having failed to release
the plaintiff from any of the debts held by them, yet, within
a month afterwards, and before this action was brought, he
was legally discharged from all those debts by obtaining a
certificate of discharge in bankruptcy. This discharge was
-notthe less complete and effectual because thb creditors had
not received payment in full, nor because the plaintiff might,
if he saw fit, by new promises to them, waive the discharge
and revive so much of the debts as had not been satisfied by
the dividends paid by the assignee in bankruptcy.
Judgmentfor nominal damages afirmed.
