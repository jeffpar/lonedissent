Such a case would be within Ogdea v. llaxwell and, 3 clTntyre
v. Trunibull, and others of like import, which are very numerous. But, as has already been shown, this suit is not of that
character. It is for the money paid, and not for delivery without payment.
It follows that there is no error in the record, and the judg-ment is consequently

BALTIMORE & 011O RAILROAD v. BATES.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OHIO.
Argued November 12, 1886.-Decided December 13, 156.

Subsections "First" and "Second" of Rev. Stat. § 639, relating to the removal of causes from State courts to Federal courts were relealed by
the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470; but subsection "Third" was not
so repealed.
Under subsection " Third," of Rev. Stat. § 639, a petition for the removal of a
cause from a State court to a Federal court may be fied at any time
before final trial or hearing.
On a petition for removal of a cause from a State court under subsecti6n
"Third" of Rev. Stat. § 639, the petitioning party is required to offer to the
court the "good and sufficient surety" required by that section for the
purposes therein set forth; and not the surety required by the act of
March 3, 1875, § 3, 18 Stat. 471, for the purposes named in that act.

This suit was brought in the Court of Common Pleas of
Licking County, Ohio, on the 1st of July, 1875, by George
Bates, a citizen of Ohio, against the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, a Maryland corporation, and having its principal office in. that State,- to recover damages for personal
injuries. The railroad company filed a general demurrer to
the petition, on the 20th of September, 1876, and on the 7th
of April, 1877, this demurrer was sustained and judgment
e'ntered in favor of the company.

Argument for 'Defendant in Error.

On the 7th of July, 1877, this judgment was reversed by the
District Court of the county, and the cause remanded to the
common pleas for further proceedings. When the case got
back, the railroad company filed a petition for removal to the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District
of Ohio, under sub-section 3 of § 639 of the Revised Statutes, on the ground of prejudice and local influence. The
petition was in proper form, and it was accompanied by the
necessary affidavit, but the security was such as was prescribed
by 639 of the Revised Statutes, and not such as was required
by § 3 of the act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470. The
act of 1875 requires security for "all costs that may be
awarded by the said Circuit Court, if the said court shall
hold that such suit was wrongfully or improperly removed
thereto." This is not found in § 639.
The petition for removal was denied by the Court of Common Pleaq, December 22, 1877, and thereupon the railroad
company answered, and the parties went to a trial May 23,
1878, when a judgment was rendered against the company.
The case was taken then, on petition in error, to the District
Court of the county, because, among others, the court erred in
denying the petition for removal. On the 28th of February,
1880, the District Court reversed the judgment for this error,
and the case was then taken to the Supreme Court of the
State, where the judgment of the District Court was reversed,
and that of the common pleas affirmed, on the 15th of May,
1883, that court holding that the security was defective, because itwas not such as the act of 1875 required. To reverse
that judgment this writ of error was brought.

ferent States provided for in the Constitution. We are aware
that this court in the case of HTess v. Pteynols, 113 U. S. 73,
has decided that the third paragraph of § 639 was not repealed
by the act of 1875 ; but we respectfully ask the court for a
reconsideration and overruling of that case. For if this third
paragraph was not superseded by the act of 1875, this casc
was not removable under that paragraph, because the petition
was not filed before the trial of the case.
The Revised Statutes, § 693, par. 3, provided that the petition for removal should be filed before "the triajl" of the case.
This case was put at issue by the demurrer, under § 260, Ohio
Code, and "A trial is a judicial examination of the issues,
whether of law or of fact, in an action or proceeding." Ohio
Code, § 262. So that this case was finally tried and decided,
and final judgment rendered before the petition for removal
was filed, and the petition for removal does not aver that the
case had not been tried, while the record showed it had been
once tried.
But it is said that where the judgment of the court has been
set aside and a new trial granted, the case is removable, and
the ease of Insurance Company v. Dunn, 19 Wall. 214, is
cited. That case was decided under the act of March 2, 1867,
which required the petition for removal to be filed "at any
time before the final hearing or trial of the suit," while in
the Revised Statutes the word "trial" is transposed from after
the word "final," and placed before it, so as to make it conform to act of 1866. This change was not made for nothing.
The case of Insurance Company -v. Dunn had already been
decided, which it is presumed Congress had full knowledge of
before they enacted the Revised Statutes. "It is apparent
that this change was not the result of accident, but was deliberately made to secure uniformity upon the subject, in view of
the conflicting decisions between the Federal and State courts

This change in the wording of the statutes appears to have

been made in consequence of the construction given to the act
of 1867, in 19 Wall.; for if Congress, having full knowledge of
that decision, had itended to follow the act of 1867, they
would have worde-it the same. Thus the law is brought
back to the state it had been in since the foundation of the
government, and under which the rights of parties had been
long seftled by judicial decisions.' See ETYig v. Cornell, 106

CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE, after stating the case, delivered

the opinion of the court.
Sub-sections 1 and 2 of § 63.9 were repealed by the act of
1875; Hyde v. .vble, 104 U. S. 407; Zing v. Corndl, 1Q6
U. S. 395, 398; H-olland v. Chamlbers, 110 U. S. 59; Ayres v.
1YatZon, 113 U. S. 594; but sub-section 3 was not. Bibe
8ooiety v. Gr'ove, 101 U. S.610; Hess v. Reynods, 113 U. S.
73, 80. Under sub-section 3, the petition for removal may be
filed at any time before the final trial or hearing. Insurance
o. v. Duna, 19 Wall. 214; Vl-awwuver v. Bryant, 21 Wall. 41;
YulvIe v. Vose, 99 U. S.539, 545; Railroad Co. v. MelKfinley,
99 U. S.147. This petition was filed after a, new txial had
actually been granted, and while the cause was pending in the
trial court for that purpose. It was, therefore, in time, and
no objection is made to its form. •
As sub-section 3 has not been repealed, so much of the
remainder of § 639 as is necessary to carry ,he .provisions. of
that sub-section into effebt remains in force, unless something
else has been put in its place. It is not contended that anything of this kind has been done, unless it be by th6 operation
of § 3 of the act of 1875, but that section by its very terms. is
only applicable to removals under § 2 of the same act. The
language is, "that whenever either party, or any one or more
of the plaintiffs or defendants entitled to remove any suit mentioned in the next preceding section," that is to say, § 2 of the
act of 1875, "shall desire to remove such suit," he shall petition
and give security in the manner and form therein prescribed.
Clearly, then, this section relates only to remov',ls provided

Opinion of the Court.

for in that act, and as sub-section 3 of § 639 remains in force,
because the cases there provided for are not included among
those mentioned in the act of 1875, it follows that the form
and mode of proceeding to secure a removal under the subsection will be sufficient if they conform to the requirements
of the other parts of the section. That section as it now
stands unrepealed is complete in itself, and furnishes its own
machinery to effect a removal of all cases which come within
its operation. The security is as much governed by the
remainder of the section as the tine for filing the petition;
and as to that, it was distinctly held in Hess v. Reynolds,
supra, that the petition was in time if presented before the
final trial, even though it was after the term at which the
cause could have been first tried, which would be too late if
§ 3 of the act of 1875 was applicable to this class of cases. As
to this the court said in that case: "We are of opinion that
this clause of § 639 remains, and is complete in itself, furnishing its own peculiar cause of removal, and prescribing, for
reasons appropriate to it, the time within which it must be
done.."
It is true this suit is between citizens of different States, and
as such it is mentioned in § 2 of the act of 1875; but the fair
meaning of § 3 is that the suit must b3 one that is removable
simply for the reason that it is one of a class such as is mentioned in § 2. Some cases in the circuit courts have been
ruled the other way, and the decision of the Supreme Court of
Ohio was put largely on their authority; but they were all
decided before Hess v. Reynolds,, supra, in this court, and that
case, as we ihink, substantially covers this.
The judgrnNt of the Supreme Court of Ohio is reversed, a cd
the cause renandedforfv ther proceedings in accordance

'With this opinion.
