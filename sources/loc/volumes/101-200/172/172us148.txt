HIARKRADER v. WADLEY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT

OF THE UNITED

STATES

FOR

THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.
No. 41.

Argued October 1, 1898. -Decided

December 5, 1898.

The facts in the record show that there is no merit in the several objections
to the jurisdiction of this court taken by the appellee in this case.
Two propositions have been so firmly established by frequent decisions of
this court as to require only to be stated: (1) When a state court has
entered upon the trial of a criminal case, under a statute not repugnant
to the Constitution of the United States, or to any law or treaty thereof,
and where the state court has jurisdiction of the offence and of the
accused, no mere error in the conduct of the trial can be made the basis
of jurisdiction in a court of the United States to review the proceedings
upon a writ of habeas corpus: (2) When a state court and a court of
the United States may each take jurisdiction of a matter, the tribunal
where jurisdiction first attaches holds it, to the exclusion of the other,
until its duty is fully performed and the jurisdiction involved is exhausted; and this rule applies alike in both civil and criminal cases.
A court of equity, although having jurisdiction over person and property
in a case pending before it, is not thereby vested with jurisdiction over
crimes committed in dealing with such property by a.party before the
civil suit was brought, and cannot restrain by injunction proceedings
regularly brought in a criminal court having jurisdiction of the crime
and of the accused.
A Circuit Court of the United States, sitting in equity in the administration
of civil remedies, has no jurisdiction to stay by injunction proceedings
pending in a state court in the name of a State to enforce the criminal
laws of such State.

IN the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western
District of Virginia, one I. G. Wadley filed a petition, signed

Statement of the Case.

and sworn to August 10, 1896, praying for the allowance of a
writ of habeas corpus. The petition was as follows:
"To the honorable Circuit Court of the United States in and
for the Western District of Virginia, at Abingdon, Virginia, Fourth Circuit.
"1Your petitioner, H. G. Wadley, respectfully represents and
shows to this honorable court that he is a citizen of the United
States of America and a citizen of the State of North Carolina,
and a resident of the city of Wilmington in that StatW; that he
is unjustly and uhilawfully detained and imprisoned in the county
jail of Wythe County, Virginia, at Wytheville, Virginia, in the
custody of I. R. Harkrader, sheriff of said county, and as such
the warden and keeper of said jail, by virtue of a warrant or
order of commitment made by the county court of Wythe
County, Virginia, at Wytheville, Virginia, on Monday, the
10th day of August, 1896, a copy of which order or warrant
of commitment is hereto annexed, marked Exhibit A.
"Your petitioner would now show that on a petition filed
by him before the Honorable Charles H. Simonton' United
States Circuit Court Judge for said Fourth Circuit, embracing
said Western District of Virginia, on the 5th of August, 1896,
the said honorable judge, Simonton, entered an order on said
petition, allowing it to be filed in the equity cause of H. G.
Wadley v. Blount d Boynton et aZ8., pending in said court,
and on said petition, duly verified and sustained by affidavits,
the said honorable judge, Simonton, on said 5th day of August,
1896, in accordance to the prayer of said petition, granted
an injunction against Robert Sayers, the Commonwealth's
attorney of Wythe County, Virginia; J. A. Walker and
C. B. Thomas, special prosecutors, and the creditors embraced
in said petition, together with their counsel, from all further
proceedings in said county court of Wythe upon an indictment
obtained against the said H. G. Wadley in said county court
on the 16th day of May, 1894, and especially from exacting or
requiring any bail or any, commitment to imprisonment of
said H. G. Wadley on said indictment in said county court.
"A certified copy of the said petition which was presented

to Judge Simonton on the 5th of August, 1896, is herewith
filed, marked Exhibit B, and a certified copy of the said
order of Judge Simonton of the 5th of August, 1896, on said
petition is likewise herewith filed, marked Exhibit C.
"Your petitioner, H. G. Wadley, would further show that
heretofore, to wit, on the 31st of January, 1895, on an injunction theretofore awarded by him to your petitioner in his case
of H. C. Wadley v. Blount & Boynton et als., in this court,
by the Honorable Nathan Goff, he, by a decree of that date;
fully sustained the contention of your petitioner by refusing
to dissolve said injunction and continuing it in full force, and
by said decree enjoined and prohibited all further prosecution
of said indictment in the county court of Wythe County, Virginia, as shown by copy of the said decree and the opinion'of the
Honorable Nathan Goff, herewith filed, marked Exhibit D.
"Your petitioner had hoped that after this final decree in
the United States Circuit Court by the Honorable Nathan
Goff on said injunction, prohibiting all further prosecution of
said indictment, that the order of that honorable court would
have been obeyed; but that was a vain conjecture, as the said
Robert Sayers, Commonwealth's attorney of Wythe County,
Virginia, and said special prosecutors, J. A. Walker and
C. B. Thomas, persisted and continued, from term to term or
from time to time, in calling up said indictment in said county
court, and asking for a continuance of the said indictment
and for the commitment of the said H. G. Wadley to the
county jail of Wythe County, and he was bailed with sureties
for his appearance before the said county court to appear on
Monday, the 10th of August, 1896, being the first day of the
August term of the said county court. Your petitioner would
now show that notwithstanding the fact that the -honorable
judge, Simonton, as aforesaid, did on the 5th of August, 1896,
enter said order especially forbidding any further order -in
said case in said court except a mere order of continuance,
and although copies of the said order .were duly executed on
said Commonwealth attorney, Robert Sayers, and on said
special prosecutors, J. A. Walker and C. B. Thomas, and, all
-of the creditors named in said petition and upon their counsel

of record by the marshal for the Western District of Virginia;
which order was duly executed on Saturday, the 8th of August, 1896"Your petitioner, H. G. Wadley, would now show that in
flagrant and contemptuous violation of both of the orders
named, that of the Honorable Nathan Goff, of the 31st of
January, 1895, prohibiting all further prosecution of paid indictment, and in violation likewise of the said order of the
Honorable Charles H. Simonton of the 5th of August, 1896,
upon the calling of the said indictment this day in said county
court of Wythe County, Virginia, the said Commonwealth's
attorney and one of the special prosecutors asked for a continuance and. stated that they had nothing to do with the question
of bail or with the question of the commitment of petitioner,
but that that was the duty of the court, and thus indirectly
accomplished what the order of- Judge .Simonton in express
wordi prohibited, for the said Commonwealth's attorney and
special prosecutors, instead of asking a compliance by the said
county court with the order of Judge Simonton, indirectly
asked the court to commit him by saying it was the duty of
the court to do so, and thereupon W. E. Fulton, the judge
of the county court of Wythe County, Virginia, in violation of
said orders of the United States court, did order the said petitioner, H. G. Wadley, to be committed to the sheriff of .Wythe
County, to keep and hold him over to answer said indictment,
which is now enjoined by the said United States court, and
your petitioner is now in the custody of the sheriff of Wythe
County, at Wytheville, who is ex ofcio the warden and jailer
of said county, and your petitioner is thus deprived of his
personal liberty by the said court on its own motion committing petitioner to the custody of the jailer of Wythe County,
Virginia, procured as aforesaid.
"Petitioner avers that the said indictment upon which petitioner Was committed was illegally and improperly obtained,
in violation of petitioner's rights as a citizen of the United
States, by the counsel for the said creditors having themselves
summoned before the grand jury of the county court of
Wythe County, Virginia, on the, 16th of May, 1894, and car-

rying before the grand jury and reading to them a copy of
the deposition, of your petitioner, which had been taken of
petitioner in an equity suit of Blount & Boynton et al8. v.
. G. Iadley et ala., and thus indirectly by said record or
deposition from the United States court taken in a cause in
that court indirectly -required petitioner to testify against
himself in a criminal case, and upon the mere copy of said
deposition of petitioner, illegally taken from the files of the
said cause in the United States court and read to said grand
jury of Wythe County, petitioner was indicted. A copy of
said indictment is fully set forth, with said exhibit, along with
the petition filed on the 5th of August, 1896, and is here referred to as a part of this petition.
"Petitioner avers that his term of imprisonment, now complained of, began on the 10th day of August, 1896, at 12
o'clock Mt., and that such imprisonment still continues, and
that he is now in the custody of the said sheriff, as such jailer,
at Wytheville, Virginia.
"Your petitioner will now show that his detention and imprisonment as aforesaid is illegal in this, to wit:
"First. -That this court, by two decrees, that of Judge Goff
of 31st of January, 1895, as also by the second order of Judge
Simonton of 5th of August, 1896, declares and adjudicates
the prior jurisdiction of the said United States court, both of
the person of your petitioner, and also of the subject-matter
of the controversy and of the issues involved in said indictment, and that said prior jurisdiction of the said United States
court renders such detention and imprisonment of prisoner by
said county court illegal.
"Second. That, as stated by the Honorable Nathan Goff in
his petition filed with his order of the 31st of January, 1895,
in the injunction case, the indictment against petitioner in
said -county court of Wythe County, Virginia, was obtained
against him illegally and in violation of his constitutional
rights as a citizen of the United States, by the misuse and
abuse of the records of the United States court, in the withdrawal therefrom of a copy of the deposition of petitioner
taken in said court in said equity cause and read and used

before the said grand jury of said county court of Wythe as
the foundation of said indictment.
"Wherefore, to be relieved from said unlawful detention
and imprisonment, your petitioner, H. G. 3Wadley, prays that
a writ of habea8 coi'pus, to be directed to I. R. Harkrader,
sheriff of Wythe County, Virginia, at Wytheville, Virginia,
and keeper of the said jail of said county, and in whose custody petitioner now is, may issue in his behalf, so that your
petitioner, H. G. Wadley, may be forthwith brought before
this court, to do, submit to and receive what the law may
direct, and upon the hearing thereof that your honor will discharge petitioner from all further custody or imprisonment,
and that he go hence without bail."
There was attached to said petition the following exhibit:
"This day came The Commonwealth, by her attorney, and
James A. Walker and C. B. Thomas, assistant prosecutors, as
well as the accused, in his own proper person, in discharge of
his recognizance; whereupon the attorney for the Commonwealth moved the court to continue this cause on the ground
that there are documents, books and papers in the possession
of I. .C. Fowler, clerk of the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Western District of Virginia, at Abingdon, and
that there are other documents, papers and books in the possession of H. B. Maupin, receiver of the said Circuit Court of

said J. L. Gleaves, then attorney for the Commonwealth of

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Statement of the Case.

In pursuance of this petition a writ of habeas corpus was
issued, on August 11, 1896, directed to I. IR. IHarkrader,
sheriff of Wythe County, Virginia, and, as such, jailer of said
county, commandifig him to bring said H. G. Wadley, together with the day and cause of his caption and detention,
before Charles H. Simonton, judge of the Circuit Court of the
United States within and for said district aforesaid, on August
14, 1896.
On August 14, 1896, I. R. Harkrader, sheriff, produced the
body of said Wadley and made the following return:
"To the honorable Judge of the United States Circuit Court
for the Fourth Circuit of the United States:
"In the matter of the petition of H. G. Wadley and the
writ of habeas copus ad subjiciendum which issued from the
clerk's office of the Circuit Court of the United States for
the Western District of Virginia on the 11th day of August,
1896, and returnable on the 14th day of August, 1896, in the
town of Wytheville, Wythe County, Virginia, this respondent,
for answer to the said writ, says that he here produces the
body of the said I. G. Wadley, the person named in the said
petition for the said writ, in obedience to the command and
direction thereof, and for further return and answer to said
writ here avers that he detained in his custody the body of
said H. G. Wadley, under and by virtue of an order of the
county court of Wythe County, State of Virginia, entered
in the case of The Commonwealtk of Virginia v. saidll. G.
TVadley on the 10th day of August, 1896, upon an indictment for a felony pending in said court against said Wadley.
So much of said order as relates to the custody of said
Wadley is here inserted in the words and figures following,
to wit:
"'And the court, of its own motion, required the prisoner
to enter into bond, with security, in the penalty of $10,000,
and until such bond is given he is committed to the custody
of the jailer of this county.'
"And now reapondent, having fully answered, prays that
said writ may be discharged, and that he may be awarded his

expended; and, in duty bound, he will ever pray, etc.
"I. R. HARKEADEE,
" SherT of Il'ythe County, Virginia, a-nd as such
Jailer Thereof."
To this return Wadley filed a reply in the following -words:
"The petitioner, I. G. Wadley, comes and says that for
ought contained in the said return of I. R. flarkrader, sheriff
of Wythe County, Virginia, to his petition for habeas 'corpus,
that petitioner is entitled to his discharge because he denies,
as contained in said return, said county court of Wythe
County, Virginia, had any jurisdiction of said petitioner or
the subject-matter of said indictment at the time it was found
or now has sfich jurisdiction. Petitioner denies the validity
of the order of commitment of said court of petitioner to said
sheriff of 10th August, 1896, relied on in said return, and says
that commitment is void, because said court has no jurisdiction
to enter it, and also because the indictment upon which*the
petitioner was so committed was obtained in violation of the
Constitution of the United States by the illegal and unconstitutional use of petitioner's deposition withdrawn from the
files of this court and carried before and read to the said grand
jury which found the said indictment, and hence said custody
is unlawful, and petitioner is deprived illegally of his personal
liberty."
He also filed the following demurrer:
"And now comes H. G. Wadley in his own proper person
and by his counsel, Blair and Blair, and having heard the
return of said sheriff read in answer to the writ of habeas corpus awarded in this cause, he says that the said return and
the matters therein contained and set forth are not sufficient
in law, and that the said return shows no legal ground for
petitioner's detention by said sheriff, and that it is not sufficiefit answer to the matters of law and fact contained in said
petition and exhibits; and this he is ready to verify; wherefore, for want of any sufficient return in this behalf, said
H. G. Wadley, the petitioner, prays judgment that the said

OCTOBER TERi, 1898.
Statement of the Case.

return be held insufficient; that an order be entered discharging petitioner from the custody of the said sheriff."
The record, as certified, discloses the following proceedings:
"On this the 14th day of August, 1896, came H. G. Wadley, the petitioner, by his counsel, Blair & Blair,*and this
cause coming on to be heard upon the petition for a writ of
habeas corpus and for order of discharge, with the exhibits
filed with the said petition, and said petition being duly verified by the affidavit of the petitioner, and upon the writ of
habeas corpus issued on said petition bn the lth of August,
1896, and duly executed upon I. R. Harkrader, sheriff of
Wythe County, and as such the jailer and warden of said
county, in whose custody the petitioner is detained, and upon
the return of said sheriff to said writ of habeas corpus, with
the commitment filed therewith as the authority under which
he acts, upon the demurrer of petitioner to said return and
joinder in said demurrer, and upon the answer and denial of the
said petitioner to said return, and upon the record in said case
of II. G. l-adley v. Blount & Boynton et al., and upon the
production of the body of said H. G. Wadley before this court
by the said sheriff, the said sheriff appearing in person, and
also by counsel, attorney general of Virginia, and after argument of counsel, and the court being fully advised in the
premises, the court finds that the said petitioner, H. G. Wadley, is unlawfully restrained of his liberty by the cohnty court
of Wythe County, Virginia, byvirtue of an order of the judge
thereof, 'committing him to custody in default of bail, entered
on the 10th of August, 1896, on an indictment of The Commonwealth of Virginia v. -H G. Wadleyj on a complaint of
felony set up in the petition, notwithstanding the injunction
and writ of this court, it is therefore considered and ordered
by this court that the said H. G. Wadley be discharged from
the custody of the said I. IR. Harkrader, sheriff of Wythe
County, Virginia, and from the custody of said court, as said
court cannot prosecute said indictment pending said injunction, and that the said H. G. Wadley hold himself subject to
the further order of this court.

Opinion of the Court.

"And it is farther ordered that the United States marshal
for the Western District of Virginia serve a copy of this order
upon I. R. Harkrader, sheriff of Wythe County, Virginia, and
as such the warden and jailer of said county, and also a copy
thereof upon W. E. Fulton, judge of said court, and Robert

"CHAjtL Es H. SIMoNTON."
Thereafter, I. R. Harkrader, sheriff of Wythe County, Virginia, by R. Taylor Scott, attorney general of Virginia and
counsel for petitioner, filed a petition for an appeal to the
Supreme Court of the United States, which was, on October
12, 1896, allowed by the Circuit Judge of the Circuit Court
for the Western District of Virginia.

Virginia, for appellant.

Itht. JUSTIcE SHIAS,

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
The appellee has moved the dismissal of the appeal because,'
as is alleged, the order discharging the prisoier on the writ
of Aabeas co;_pus was made by a judge, and not by a court;
because the order, whether made by a judge or a court, was
not final, as the prisoner was discharged only "pending said
injunction," and was held subject to the further order of the
United States Circuit Court, and because there was no certificate from the court below as to the distinct question of jurisdiction involved.
VOL. CLXXI-1I

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

It is, indeed, true, as was decided in Cag-er v. Ftzgerald,
121 U. S. 87, that no appeal lies to this court from an order
of a Circuit Judge of the United States, and not as a court,
discharging the prisoner brought before him on a writ of
habeas corpus. But this record discloses that, while the
original order was made at chambers, the final order, overruling the return of the sheriff and discharging the prisoner
from custody, was the decision of the Circuit Court at a stated
term, and therefore the case falls within i.m re Palliser, 136
U. S. 257, 262.
We see no merit in the suggestion that the order discharging the prisoner was not a final judgment. It certainly, if
valid, took away the custody of the prisoner from the state
court, and put an end to his imprisonment under the process
of that court.
That the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was put in issue
by the petition for the writ of habeas corpus and the return
thereto, is quite, evident. The contention made, that such
question has not been presented to us by a sufficiently explicit
certificate, we need not consider, for the case plainly involves
the application of the Constitution of the United States. The
division and apportionment of judicial power made by that
instrument left to the States the right to make and enforce
their own criminal laws. And while it is the duty of this
court, in the exercise of its judicial power, to maintain the
supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States,
it is also its duty to guard the States from any encroachment
upon their reserved rights-by the General Government or the
courts thereof. As we shall presently see, this is the nature
of the question raised by this record.
It is doubtless true, as urged by the appellee's counsel, that
an assignment of error cannot import into a cause questions
of jurisdiction which the record does not show distinctly
raised and passed on in the court below; but we think that
this record does disclose that the assignments of error, which
were embodied in the prayer for an appeal, set up distinctly
the very questions of jurisdiction which were contained in the
record and passed on by the trial court.

HARKRADER v. WADLEY.
Opinion of the Court.

The further contention on behalf of the appellee, that the
record does not show that the appeal as allowed was ever
"filed" in the United States Circuit Court, and that therefore
this court is without jurisdiction to entertain the case, we cannot accept, because we think the record, as certified to us, distinctly shows that the petition for appeal was filed on October
8, 1896; that the appeal was allowed on October 12, 1896;
that the bond, containing a recital that the said Harkrader,
sheriff, had "obtained an appeal and filed a copy thereof in
the clerk's office of said court," was filed and approved on
October 12, 1896; and that the citation was served and duly
filed. This is a plain showing that the appeal as allowed was
duly "filed."
It is sufficient to cite Credit Co. v. Arkansas
Central Railway, 128 U. S. 258, 261, where it was said: "An
appeal cannot be said to be 'taken' any more than a writ of
error can be said to be ' brought ' until it is, in some way, presented to the court which made the decree appealed from,
thereby putting an end to its jurisdiction over the cause, and
making it its duty to send it to the appellate court. This is
done by filing the papers, viz., the petition and allowance of
appeal (where there is such petition and allowance), the
appeal bond and the citation. In Brandies v. Cochrane, 105
U. S. 262, it was held that in the absence of a petition and
allowance, the filing of the appeal bond, duly approved by a
justice of this court, was sufficient evidence of the allowance
of an appeal, and was a compliance with the law requiring
the appeal to be filed in the clerk's office."
We now come to the question, thus solely presented for our
consideration, Had the Circuit Court of the United States
authority to issue a writ of habeas cofpus to take and discharge a prisoner from the custody of the state court when
proceeding under a state statute not repugnant to the Constitution or laws of the United States, under which the prisoner
had been indicted for an offence against the laws of the
State?
Two propositions have been so firmly established by frequent decisions of this colirt as to require only to be stated:
First. When a state court has entered upon the trial of a

Opinion of the Court.

criminal case, undera statute not -repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, or to any law or treaty thereof, and
where the state court has jurisdiction of the offence and of
the accused, no mere error in the conduct of the trial can be
made the basis of jurisdiction in a court of the United States
to review the proceedings upon a writ of habeas oorpyus. Andrews v. Swartz, 156 U. S. 272; Bergmann v. Backer, 157
U. S. 655. Second. When a state court and a court of the
United States may each take jurisdiction of a matter, the
tribunal where jurisdiction first attaches holds it, to the exclusion of the other, until its duty is fully performed and the
jurisdiction involved is exhausted; and this rule applies alike
in both civil and criminal cases. ._reeman v. Rowe, 24 How.
450; -Buck v. Colbath, 3 Wall. 334; Taylor v. Taintor, 16
Wall. 366; Ex-carte Crouch, 112 U. S. 178.
In the present case it is not contended that the state statute, under which the county court of Wythe County was
proceeding, was repugnant to the Constitution or any law
of the United States, or that the State did not have jurisdiction of the offence charged and of the person of the accused.
But it is claimed, under the second of the above propositions, that as the Circuit Court of the United States had
obtained prior and therefore exclusive jurisdiction of the
affairs and assets of the Wytheville Banking and Insurance
Company, a corporation of the State of Virginia, by virtue
of two suits in equity.brought in said court in October, 1893,
by creditors of the said banking company, in which suits a
receiver to take charge of the property of the bank, and a
master to take all necessary accounts, had been appointed,
it followed that the state court had no jurisdiction, pending
those suits, to proceed by way of indictment and trial against
an officer for the offence of, embezzlement, as created and defined by a valid statute of the State of Virginia. For the
state court to so proceed, it is claimed, constituted an interference with the Federal court in the exercise of its jurisdiction; and that hence it was competent for the United States
court to grant an injunction against the prosecution of the

HARKRADER v. WADLEY.
Opinion of the Court.

criminal case and to release the prisoner by a writ of habeas
corpus directed to the sheriff.
It is not denied, on behalf of the appellee, that by section
720 of the Revised Statutes it is enacted that the writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United
States to stay proceedings in any court of a State, except
where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating
to proceedings in bankruptcy. Nor do we understand that it
is denied that, apart from the effect of section* '720, the general rule, both in England and in this country, is that courts
of equity have no jurisdiction, unless expressly granted by
statute, over the prosecution, the punishment or pardon of
crimes and midemeanors, or over the appointment and removal of public officers, and that to assume such a jurisdiction, or to sustain a bill in equity to restrain or relieve against
'proceedings for the punishment of offences, or for the removal
of public officers, is to invade the domain of the courts of
common law, or of the executive and administrative department of the Government. In re Sawyer, 124 U. S.200.
But, as respects section 720, it is argued that it must be read
in connection with section 716, which provides that "The Supreme Court and the Circuit and District Courts shall have
power to issue writs of screfacids. They shall also have power
to issue all writs not specially provided for by statute, which
may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law;"
and the.cases of Freneh v. Hay, 22 Wall. 231, 253, and
.Diet-z-ch v. Iuidekoper, 103 U. . 494, are cited to the
alleged effect that the prohibition in section 720 does not
apply where the jurisdiction of a Federal court has first
attached.
The cited cases were of ancillary bills, and were, in substance proceedings in the Federal courts to enforce their own
judgments by preventing the defeated parties from wresting
replevied property from the plaintiffs in replevin, who by the
final judgments were entitled to it.
As was said in Dietzsech v. Huidekoper: "A court of the
United States is not prevented from enforcing its own judg-

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

ments by the statute which forbids it to grant a writ of injunction to stay proceedings in a state court. Dietzsch,.the
original plaintiff in the action on the replevin bond, repi'esented the real parties in interest, and he was a party to the
-action of replevin, which had been pending, and was finally
determined in the United States Circuit Court. That court
had-jurisdiction of his person, and could enforce its judgment
in the replevin suit against him, or those whom he represented. The bill in this case was filed for that purpose and
that only."
Nor was there any attempt mande in those cases to enjoin
the state courts or any state officers engaged in the enforcement of any.judgment or order of a state court.
It is further contended that when the parties sought to be
enjoined have, as plaintiffs, submitted themselves to the court,
by a bill in equity, as to the matter or right involved, a bill
for an injunction will lie to prevent interference by criminal
procedure in another court; and the decision of this court in
In re Sawyer, 121 U. S. 200, is cited, where Mr. Justice Gray
said : "Modern decisions in England, by eminent equity judges,
concur in holding that a court of chancery has no power to
restrain criminal proceedings, unless they are instituted by a
.party to a suit already pvending before it, and to try the same
9'ight that is in issue there." So, also, the case of The Mayor
&c. of York v. Pilkington, 2 Atkins, 302, is cited, and in that
case, where plaintiffs in a chancery bill and cross bill to
establish in equity their sole i'ight of fishing in a certain
stream, while their bill was still pending, caused the defendant to be indicted at the York Criminal Court for a breach of
the peace for such fishing, Lord Hardwicke awarded an injunction to restrain the plaintiff from all further criminal proceedings in other courts, and said that if a plaintiff filed a bill
in equity against a defendant for a right to land and a right
to quiet the possession thereof, and after that he had preferred
an indictment against such defendant for a forcible entry into
said land, the court of equity would certainly stop the indictment by an injunction.
But the observations quoted had reference to cases where

RARKRADER v. WADLEY.
Opinion of the Court.

the same rights were involved in the civil and criminal cases,
and where the legal question involved was the same. Thus
the case of the fishery, both in the civil and the criminal proceeding, involved the right of the defendant to fish in certain
waters where the plaintiff claimed an exclusive right, and, as
no actual breach of the peace was alleged, the public was not
concerned. And when, in the later case of Lord .Montague v.
Dudman, 2 Yesey, 396, where an injunction was prayed for
to stay proceedings in a mandamus, his ruling in .Mayor of
Fork v.. Pilkington was cited, Lord Hardwicke said: "This
court has no jurisdiction to grant an injunction to stay proceedings on a mandamus, nor to an indictment, nor to an
information. As to -Mayor of York v. Pilkington, the court
granted an order to stay the proceedings because the question
of right was depending in the court in order to determine the
right, and therefore it was reasonable they should not proceed
by action or indictment until it was determined."
If any case could be supposed in which a court of equity
might look behind the formal proceeding, in the name of the
State, to see that its promoters are parties to the case pending
in the court of equity, using the process of the criminal court,
not to enforce the rights of the public, but to coerce the defendant to surrender in the civil case, it is sufficient to say
that, in the present case, the indictment, whose prosecution
the Circuit Court sought to stay, appears to have been regularly found, and to assert an offence against a law of the
State, the validity of which is not assailed.
The fallacy in the argument of the appellee in the present
case is in the assumption that the same right was involved in
the criminal case in the state court and in the equity case
pending in the Federal court. But it is obvious that the civil
liability of Wadley to indemnify the plaintiffs in the equity
suits, by reason of losses occasioned by his misconduct as an
officer of the bank, is another and very different question from
his criminal liability to the Commonwealth of Virginia for
embezzlement of funds of the bank. There might well be
different conclusions reached in the two courts. A jury in
the criminal case might, properly enough, conclude that, how-

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

ever foolish and unjustifiable the defendant's conduct may
have been, he was not guilty of intentional wrong. The
court, in the equity case, might rule that the defendant's disregard of the ordinary rules of good sense and management
was so flagrant as to create a civil liability to those thereby
injured, without viewing him as a criminal worthy of imprisonment. The verdict and judgment in the criminal case,
whether for or against the accused, could not be pleaded as
resjudicaain the equity suits. Nor could the conclusion of
the court in. equity, as to the civil liability of Wadley, be
*pleadable either for or against him in the trial of the criminal
case. Surely if, by reason of a compromise or of failure of
proof, the eourt in equity made no decree against Wadley, the
Commonwealth of Virginia would not be thereby estopped
from asserting his delinquencies under the criminal laws of
the State. 'Nor would the court in equity be prevented, by a
favorable verdict and judgment rendered in the state court,
from adjudging a liability to persons injured by the defendant's official misbehavior.
And this reasoning is still more cogent where the respective
courts belong one to the state and the other to the Federal
system.
Embezzlement by an officer of a bank organized under a
state statute is not an offence which can be inquired into or
punished by a Federal court. Such an offence isagainst the
authority and laws of the State. The judicial power granted
to their Courts by the Constitution of the United States does
not cover such a case. The Circuit Court of the United States
for the Western District of Virginia could not, in the first
instance, have taken jurisdiction of the offence charged in the
indictment, nor can it, by a bill in -equity, withdraw the case
from the state court, or suspend or stay its proceedings.
In both of the injunctions pleaded in answer to the return
of the sheriff the attorney of the Commonwealth of Virginia
for Wythe County was named as such, and was thereby prohibited from all further prosecution of the indictment pending
in the county court of Wythe County in the name of the
Commonwetla of Virginia v.H. G. Wadley, charged with

HARKRADER v.. WADLEY.
Opinion of the Court.

embezzlement of the funds of the Wytheville InsurAnce and
Banking Company.
No case can be found where an injunction against a state
officer has been upheld where it was conceded that such officer
was proceeding under a valid state statute. In the present
case the Commonwealth's attorney, in the prosecution of an
indictment found under a law admittedly valid, represented
the State of Virginia, and the. injunctions were therefore in
substance injunctions against the State. In proceeding by
indictment to enforce a criminal statute the State can only
act by officers or attorneys, and to enjoin the latter is to
enjoin the State. As was said in In re Ayers, 123 U. S.
443, 497: " H ow else can the State be forbidden by judicial
process to bring actions in its name, except by constraining
the conduct of its officers, its attorneys and its agents? And
if all such officers, attorneys and agents are personally subjected to the process of the court, so as to forbid their acting
in its behalf, how can it be said that the State itself is not
subjected to the jurisdiction of the court as an actual and-teal
defendant?"
It is further contended, on behalf of the appellee, that even
if the injunctions in the equity causes, restraining the proceedings in the county court were erroneous, they could not be
attacked collaterally by this appeal in the habeas corpus case.

The obvious answer to this is that this court is dealing only
with the question of the jurisdiction of the court below. To
the return of the sheriff, justifying his detention of the prisoner by setting up the order of the county court, the petitioner,
Wadley, by way of reply pleaded the injunctions. This, of
course, raised the question of the validity of those injunctions.
If they were void, they conferred no jurisdiction upon the
Circuit Court to enforce them as against the officers and process of the state court.
Again, it is urged that the indictment had been improperly
found by reason of the admission before the grand jury of
Wadley's deposition in the civil case. But, even if what
passed in the grand jury room can be inquired into on a writ
of habeas corpus, and this we do not concede, the remedy for

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

such misconduct must be sought in the court having control
and jurisdiction over the proceedings.
So, too, any offence to the dignity or authority of the
Circuit Court, by the misuse of its records or papers, by its
suitors or their counsel, can be corrected by that court without extending its action so as to include the state court or its
officers.
We are of opinion, then, that a court of equity, although
having jurisdiction over person and property in a case pending before it, is. not thereby vested with jurisdiction over
crimes committed in dealing with such property by a party
before the civil suit was brought, and cannot restrain by injunction proceedings regularly brought in a criminal court
having jurisdiction of the crime and of the accused. Much
more are we of opinion that a Circuit Court of the United.
States, sitting in equity in the administration of civil remedies, has n6 jurisdiction, to stay by injunction proceedings
pending in a state court in the name of a State to enforce the
criminal laws of such State.
Therefore the judgment of the Circuit Court qf the United
States for the Western District of Virginia, discharging
said H. G. Wadley from the custody of the said I 1?.
Rarkrader,sherif of IMythe County, Virginia, andfrom,
the custody of said county court of IVythe County, is
