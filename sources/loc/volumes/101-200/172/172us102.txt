IMcCULLOUGH v. VIRGINIA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE
OF VIRGINIA.
No. 8. Argued February 21, 23, 1898. - Decided December 5, 1899.

On the 29th of May, 1892, the plaintiff below (plaintiff in error here) filed a
bill in the Circuit Court of the city of Norfolk, Virginia, to establisl the
genuineness of certain coupons tendered by him in payment of taxes, and
obtained a judgment there in his favor. When the suit was commenced,
the highest court of Virginia had often decided against the right to require the State to accept such coupons in payment of taxes. This court,
on'the other hand, in a series of decisions reaching from 1880 to 1889,
had-been uniform and positive in favor of the validity of the act authorizing the issue of such bonds, and of the liability of the State to accept
the coupons in payment of taxes. In time present case the Supreme
Court of Appeals of Virginia dismissed the plaintiff's petition, on appeal,
and awarded costs to the Commonwealth, on the ground that the coupon
provision of the act of 1871 was void. In the previous cases there had
been no direct decision by the state court that such provision was
entirely void, although the intimation was clear that such was the optnion of the judges then composing the court. It was contended by the
State that this court has no jurisdiction of this case, for the reason that
the state Court of Appeals does not consider, in its opinion, the subsequent legislation of -the State, passed with a view to impair the act of
1871, but limits itself-to the consideration of- that act, which it adjudges
to be void, and also that the repeal of the act -of 1882, after the judgment in the trial court below, amounts to a withdrawal of the consent
of the State to be sued, and is fatal to the maintenance of this action.
Held:
(I) That the lawful owner of such coupons has the right to tender the
same after maturity in payment of taxes, debts and demands due
the State;
(2) That this court has the right to inquire and judge for itself with regard to the making of the alleged contract with the holder of the
coupons without regard to the views or decisions of the state
court in-relation thereto;
(3) That the owner's right to pay taxes in coupons Is not affected by the
consideration that some taxes, other than the ones now in question, were, when the act of 1871 was passed, required to be paid
in money;
(4) That while it is true that the state court placed its decision on tile
ground that the act of 1871 was void, in so far as it related to

McCULLOUGH v. VIRGINIA.
Statement of the Case.
the coupon contract, the judgment also gave effect to subsequent
statutes; and this court has jurisdiction of the chse;
(5) That the rights acquired by the plaintiff under the judgment, were
not lost or disturbed by the repeal, after judgment, of the act
of 1882.

Ox March 30, 1871, the general assembly of the State of
Virginia passed an act for the refunding of the public debt.
Virginia Acts Assembly, 1870-71, p. 378. See also act of
March 28, 1879; Virginia Acts Assembly, 1878-79, p. 264.
This act, which authorized the issue of new coupon bonds for
two thirds of the old bonds, leaving the other third as the
basis of an equitable claim upon the State of West Virginia,
contained this provision: "The coupons shall be payable
semiannually, and be receivable at and after maturity for all
taxes, debts, dues and demands due the State, which shall be
so expressed on their face." Under this act a large amount
of the outstanding debt of the State was refunded. This provision gave value to the bonds as affording an easy method
of securing payment of the interest. This refunding scheme,
however, did not prove satisfactory to the people of the State,
and since then there has been repeated legislation tending to
destroy or impair the right granted by this prQvision. Among
other statutes may be noticed the following: The act .of
March 7, 1872, c. 148, Acts of Assembly, 1871-72, p. 141,
providing that it should not be "lawful for the officers charged
with the collection of taxes or other demands of the State, due
now or that shall hereafter become due, to receive in payment
thereof anything else than gold or silver coin, United States
Treasury notes,, or notes of the national banks of the United
States." That of March .25, 1873, c. 231, Acts of Assembly,
1872-73, p. 207, imposing a tax of fifty cents on the hundred dollars market value of bonds, and directing that such
amount be deducted from coupons tendered in payment of
taxes or dues.
At the time the *act of 1871 was passed and the new bonds
and coupons were issued, the Court of Appeals of the State had
jurisdiction to grant a mandamus in any action where the writ
would lie according to the principles of the common law, and in

101:

OCTOBER TERMf, 1898.
Statement of the Case.

Antoni v. Wright, 22 Gratt. 833, it was held by that court that
mandamus vwas the proper remedy to compel the collector to
accept coupons offered in payment of taxes. On January 14,
1882, the assembly passed an act, Acts 1881-82, c. 7,p. 10,
which, in effect, provided that a taxpayer seeking to use
coupons in p-ayment of his taxes should pay the taxes in money
at the time of tendering the coupons, and thereafter bring
a suit to establish the genuineness of the coupons, which, if
decided in his favor, enabled him to obtain from the treasurer
a return of the money paid. The various features of this act
are specifically pointed out in Antoni v. Greenhow, 107 U. S.
769. At the same session, and on January 26, 1882, Acts
1881-82, c. 41, p. 37, the assembly passed a further act declaring that the tax collectors should receive in payment of
taxes and other dues "gold, silver, United States Treasury
notes- national bank currency and nothing else," with a pro-vision for suit by one claiming that such exaction was illegal.
The act contained this proviso: "There shall be no other remedy in any case of the collection of revenue, or the attempt to
collect revenue illegally, or the attempt to collect revenue in
funds only receivable by said officers under this law, the same
being otlier and different funds than the taxpayer may tender
or claim the right to pay, than such as are herein provided;
and no writ for the prevention of any revenue claim, or to
hinder or delay the collection of the same, shall in anywise
issue, either injunction, supersedeas, mandamus, prohibition
or any other -writ or process whatever; but in all cases, if for
any reason any persoi shall claim that the revenue so collected of him was wrongfully or illegally collected, the remedy for such person shall *be as above provided, and in no
other manner."
At the same session, on February 14, 1882, a new funding
bill was passed containing a proposition to the bondholders,
act of April 7,1882, c. 84, Acts 1881-82, p. 88; and again at
the same session, on April 7,1882, an'act was passed amending
the Code of Virginia in respect to mandamus, which provided:
"That no writ of mandamus, prohibition or any other summary process whatever, shall issue in any case of the collec-

tion, or attempt to collect revenue, or to compel the collecting officers to receive anything in payment of taxes other
than as provided in chapter forty-one, Acts of Assembly,
approved January twenty-six, eighteen hundred and eightytwo, or in any ease arising out of the collection of revenue
in which the applicant for the writ or process has any other
remedy adequate for the protection and enforcement of his
individual right, claim and demand, if just." Acts 1881-82,
p. 342.
On March 15, 1884, the general assembly passed a general
act in reference to the assessment of taxes on persons, property and incomes, Acts 1883-S4, c. 450, p. 561, the one hundred and thirteenth section (p. 603) of which required that all
school taxes should be paid "only in lawful money of the
United States."
On January 21, 1886, Acts 1885-86, c. 46, p. 37, an act was
passed providing that in a suit in respect to coupons tendered
in payment of taxes, no expert testimony should be receivable, and that the bonds from which the coupons were cut
should be produced, if demanded, as a condition precedent to
the right of recovery.
Section 399 of "The Code of Virginia," which was a revision and" reenactment of the general statutes of the State,
adopted May 16, 1887, reads: "It shall not be lawful for any
officer charged with the collection of taxes, debts or other
demands of the State to receive in payment thereof anything
else than gold or silver coin, United States Treasury notes or
national bank notes."
On May 29, 1892, the plaintiff in error filed his petition in
the Circuit Court of the city of Norfolk to establish the genuineness of certain coupons tendered in payment of taxes. The
proceeding was had under the act of 1882, and no question is
made of a full compliance with the terms of that statute.
Judgment was rendered in his favor by the Circuit Court of
the city of INorfolk, which judgment was, on March 23, 1894,
reversed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State, 90
Virginia, 597, and a judgment entered in favor of the Comimonwealth, dismissing the petition of the plaintiff and award-

opinion of the court.
Perhaps no litigation has been more severely contested or
has presented more intricate and troublesome questions than
that which has.arisen under the coupon legislation of Virginia. That legislation -has been prolific of many cases, both
in the state and Federal courts, nota few of which finally
came to this court. HIartman v. Greenhow, 102 U. S. 672;
Antohi v. Greenhow, 107 U. S. 7.69; Virginia "CoupoA cases,

Virginia,117 U. S. 612; Jr. re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443; MoGahey
v. Virginia,.135 U. S. 662.
For the first time. in the history of this litigation has any
appellate coirt, either state or Federal, distinctly ruled that
the eoupon -provision of the act of 1871 was void. After the
passage of the act of Maich 7 1872, which in terms required
all taxes to be paid in cash, the case of AntOni v. lfrigA came
before the Court of Appeals of Virginia,. 22. Gratt. 833, and
on December 13, 1872, was decided. 'Elaborate opinions were
filed, and the court held the act of 1871 valid, and the act of
1872 void as violating th 9 contract embraced in the coupon
provision of the act of 1871. This decision was reaffirmned in

McCULLOUGH v. VIRGINIA.
Opinion of the Court.

Wise Bros. v. Rogerm, 24 Gratt. 169, decided, December 17,
1873; Clar~v. Tyler, 30 Gratt. 134, decided April 4, 1878, and
again in Williamown v. Mas8ey, 33 Gratt. 237, decided April
29, 1880. In Greenlww v. VFashon, 81 Virginia, 336, decided
January 14, 1886, the act requiring school taxes to be paid in
cash was si~ptained; and such taxes excepted from the coupon
contract on the ground of a specific command in the state
constitution in force at the time of the passage of the funding
act. There was no direct decision that the coupon provision
was entirely void, although the intimation was clear that such
was the opinion of the judges then composing the court.
In this court-the decisions have been uiniform and positive
in favor of the validity of the act of 1871. There has been
no dissonance in the declarations, from the first case, -Hartman
v. Greenow, 102 U. S.672, 679, decided at the October term,
1880, in which, referring to this act, the court said, by Mr.
Justice Field, "a contract was thus consummated between the
State and the holder of the new bonds, and the holders of the
coupons, from the obligations of which she-could not, without
their consent, release herself by any subsequent legislation.
She thus bound herself, not only to pay the bonds when they
became due, but to receive the interest coupons from the
bearer at and after their maturity, to their full amount, for any
taxes or dues by him to the State. This receivability of the
coupons for such taxes and dues was written on their face,
and accompanied them into whatever hands they passed. It
constituted their chief value, and. was the main consideration
offered to the holders of the old bonds to surrender them and
accept new bonds for two thirds of their amount," to .MeGahey
v. Virginia, 135 U. S. 662, 668, decided at the October term,
1889, in which Mr. Justice Bradley, delivering the unanimous
opinion of the court, observed: "We have no hesitation in
saying that the act of 1871 was a valid act, and that it d.d and
does constitute a contract between the State and the holders
of the bonds issued under it, and that the holders of the
coupons of said bonds, whether still attached thereto or separated therefrom, are entitled, by a solemn engagement of the
State, to use them in payment of state taxes and public dues.

.OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

This was determined in Ilartca'&v. Greenhow, 102 U. S. 672,
decided in January, 1881; in Antoni v. Greenhow, 107 U. S.
769, decided in March, 1883; in the Virginia Coupon case8,
-114 U. S. 269, decided in April, 1885, and in all the cases on
the subject that have come before this court for adjudication.
This question, therefore, may be considered as foreclosed and
no longer open for consideration. It may be laid down as
undoubted law that the lawful owner of any such coupons
has the right to tender the same after maturity in absolute
payment of all taxes, debts, dues and demands due from him
to the State."
Since the decision of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, in
Antoni v. Wright, 22 Gratt. 833, that the act of 1872, providing for the payment of taxes in cash only was unconstitutional, the general assembly of Virginia has from time to
time passed acts tending to embarrass the coupon holder in
the exercise of the right granted by the funding act. Some
of these acts appear in the statement preceding this opinion,
but for a more full review of the legislation and the course of
decision reference may be had to the opinion of Mr. Justice
Bradley in the several cases reported under the title of
MoGahey v. Virginia, 8upra.
We are advised by the opinion of the Court of Appeals
of Virginia, in 22 Gratt. 833, that the debt-two thirds of
which was proposed to be refunded and most of which was,
in fact, refunded- amounted to $40,000,000 of principal.
These refunding bonds, amounting to many millions of dollars, have passed into the markets of the world, and have so
passed accredited, not merely by the action of the General
Assembly of the State of Virginia, but by the repeated decisions of her highest court, as well-as of this court, for substantially a quarter of a century, to the effect that such coupon
provision was constitutional and binding. NTow, at the end
of twenty-seven years from the passage of the act, we are
asked to hold'that this guarantee of value, so fortified as it
has been, was never of any validity, that the decisions to that
effect are of no force and that all the transactions which have
been had based thereon rested upon nothing. 'Such a result

McCULLOUGH v. VIRGINIA.
Opinion of the Court.

-

is so startling that. it at least compels more than ordinary
consideration.
We pass, therefore, to a consideration of the specific question presented in this record. First. It is-insisted that the
decision of the Court of Appeals was right, and that the
coupon provision was void. It were a waste of time to repeat
all the arguments which have been heretofore presented, and
we content ourselves with reiterating that which was said, by
Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the entire court, in McGahey
v. Virgina,' 135 U. S. 662, 668: "This question, therefore,
may be considered as foreclosed and no longer open for consideration. It may be laid down as undoubted law that the
lawful owner of any such coupons has the right to. tender the
same after maturity in absolute payment of all- taxes, debts,
dues and dernands due from him to the State."
Secondly. It is insisted that whatever may be our own
opinions upon the case, we are to take the construction placed
by the Court %fAppeals of Virginia upon the act as the law
of that State. While it is undoubtedly the general rule of'
this'court to accept the construction placed by the courts of
a State upon its statutes and constitution, yet one exception
to this rule has always been recognized, and that in reference
to the matter of contracts alleged to have been impaired.
This was distinctly affirmed in Jeermon Branc .Bank v.
8kelly, 1 Black, 436, 443, in which the court, speaking by
Mr. Justice Wayne, gave these reasons for the exception:
"It has never been denied, nor is it now, that the Supreme
Court of the United States has an appellate ,power to revise
the judgment of the Supreme Court of a State, whenever
such a court shall adjudge that not to be a contract which
has been alleged, in the forms of legal proceedings, by a litigant, to be one, within the meaning of that clause of the Constitution of the .United States which inhibits the States from
passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts. Of
what use would the appellate power be to the litigant who
feels himself aggrieved by some particular state legislation,
if this court could not decide, independently of all adjudication by the Supreme Court of a State, whether or not the

OCTOBER TER-M, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

phraseology of the instrument in controversy was expressive
of a contract and within the protection of the Constitution of
the United States, and that its obligation should be enforced,
notwithstanding a contrary conclusion by the Supreme Court
of a State? It never was intended, and cannot be sustained
by any course of reasoning, that this court should, or could
with fidelity to the Constitution of the United States, follow
the construction of the Supreme Court of a State in such a
matter, when it entertained a different opinion." The doctrine thus announced has been uniformly followed. Bridge
Proprietorsv. Hfoboken Company, 1 Wall. 116, 145; IMright v.
Nagle, 101 U. S. 791, 793; McGahey v. Virginia, 135 U. S.
664, 667, in which, in reference to this very contract, it was
said: "In ordinary cases the decision of the highest couit of
a State with regard to the validity of one of its statutes would
be binding upon this court; but where the question raised is,
whether a contract has or has not been made, the obligation
of which is alleged to have been impaired by legislative action,
it is the prerogative of this. court* under the Constitution of
the United States and the acts of Congress relating to writs
of error to the judgments of state courts, to inquire and judge
'for itself with regard to the making of such contract, whatever may be the views or decisions of the state courts in relation thereto." See also Douglasv. Eentucky, 168 U. S. 488,
501, and cases cited therein.
Thirdly. It is urged that our last decision, that in foGahey
v. Virginia, 8?pra, logically leads to the conclusion that the
whole coupon contract was,void; and that the Court of Appeals
of Virginia rightly interpreted the scope of that decision when
it so held. The argument of that court is that because the
constitution of Virginia compels the payment of certain taxes
in cash, and that therefore the coupon contract cannot be
enforced as against those taxes, the whole contract must fail,
the partial failure being a vice which enters into and destroys
the entire contract. But the court overlooks that which was
in fact decided in the eight cases reported under the. title of
ifeGa.hey v. Virginia, for while in two of those cases it was
held that the coupon contract could not be enforced against

McCULLOUGH v. VIRGINIA.
Opinion of the Court.

certain specific taxes and dues, it was in others as distinctly
held that it could be enforced in respect to general taxes.
It may be well to here quote the language with which Mr,
Justice Bradley concludes his general review of the prior
litigation, and which in its last paragraph shows that this very
matter was considered and determined (pp. 684, 685):
"Without committing ourselves to all that has been said, or
even all that may have been adjudged, in the preceding cases
that have come before the court on the subject, we think it
clear that the following propositions have been established:
"First, that the provisions of the act of 1871 constitute
a contract between the State of. Virginia and the lawful
holders of the bonds and coupons issued under and in pursuance of said statute;
"Second, that the various acts of the assembly of Virginia
passed for the purpose of restraining the use of said coupons
for the payment of taxes and other dues to the State, and
imposing impediments and obstructions to that use, and to the
proceedings instituted for establishing their genuineness, do in
many respects materially impair the obligation of that contract, and cannot be held to be valid or binding in so far as
they have that effect;
"Third, that no proceedings can be instituted by any holder
of said bonds or coupons against the Commonwealth of Virginia, either directly by suit against the Commonwealth by
name, or indirectly against her executive officers to control
them in the exercise of their official functions as agents of the
State;
"Fourth,

that any lawful holder of the tax-receivable

coupons of the State issued under the act of 187i or the subsequent act of 1879, who tenders such coupons in payment of
taxes, debts, dues and demands due from him to the State,
and continues to hold himself ready to tender the same in
payment thereof, is entitled to be free from molestation in
person or goods on account of such taxes, debts, dues or
demands, and may vindicate such right in all lawful modes
of redress- by suit to recover his property, by suit against
the officer to recover damages for taking it, by injunction to

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

prevent such taking where it would be attended with irremediable injury, or by a defence to a suit brought against him
for his taxes or the other claims standing against him. No
conclusion short of this can be legitimately drawn from the
series of decisions which we have above reviewed, without
wholly overruling that rendered in the coupon cases and
disregarding many of the rulings in other cases, which we
should be very reluctant to do. To the extent here announced
we feel bound to yield to the authority of the prior decisions
of this court, whatever may have been the former views of
any meinber of the court.
"There may be exceptional cases of taxes, debts, dues and
demands due to the State which cannot be brought within the
olieration of the rights secured to the holders of the bonds and
coupons issued under the acts of 1871 and 1879. When such
cases occur they will have to be disposed of according to their
own circumstances and conditions?'
Neither is the argument a sound one. It ignores the difference between the statute and the contract and confuses
the two entirely distinct matters of construction and validity.
The statute precedes the contract. Its scope and meaning
must be determined before any question will arise as to the
validity of the contract which it authorizes. It is elementary
law that every statute is to be read in the light of the Constitution. However broad and general its language, it cannot
be interpreted as extending beyond those matters which it
was within the constitutional power of the legislature to
reach. It is the same rule which obtains in the interpretation ofany private contract between individuals. That, whatever may be its words, is always to be construed in the light
of the statute; of the law then in force; of the circumstances
and conditions of the parties. So, although general langudge
was introduced into the statute of 1871,.it is not to be read as
reaching to matters in respect to which the legislature had no
constitutional power, but only'as to those matters within its
control. And if there were, as it seems there were, certain
special taxes and dues which under the existing provisions
of the state constitution could not be affected by legislative

McCULLOUGH v. VIRGINIA.
Opinion of the Court.

action, the statute is to be read as though it in terms excluded
them from its operation.
Indeed, the Court of Appeals does not follow what it calls',
the logic of the decision in AfcGahey v. Yirginia to its necessary result. The scbpe of its argument is that if a part of
the consideration be illegal, the whole contract fails. But the
promise on the part of the State, written into these coupons
and authorized by the act of 1871, was a promise to pay so
much money and to receive such promise in satisfaction of
taxes. In reference to this, the Court of Appeals, in its opinion
in this case, uses this language:
"We do not assail that act as unconstitutional as an entirety.
We simply hold that the coupon feature of the act; the coupon
contract, which is readily separable from the rest of the act,
is repugnant to sections 7 and 8 article 8 of the constitution
of Virginia, and is, therefore, an illegal contract. The validity
of the bonds issued under and by authority of said acts of
March 30, 1871, and March 28, 1879, is not denied; nor is it
denied that the bondholders are entitled to the interest on the
bonds, to be collected in the ordinary way; but we do deny
that it can be collected through the medium of the illegal
coupon, which have been most aptly designated the ' cut

worm of the treasury.'
to
which it refers make against the

Further,
conclusion which it reaches. Thus, at the end of its argument, it quotes as a principal authority the following:
"The concurrent doctrine of the text books on the law of
contracts is that if one of two considerations of a promise be
void merely, the other will support the promise; but that if
one of two considerations be unlawful the promise is void.
When, however, for a legal consideration, a party undertakes
to do one or more acts, and some of them are unlawful, the
contract is good for so much as is lawful and void for the
residue. Whenever the unlawful part of the contract can be
separated from the rest it will be rejected and the remainder
established. But this cannot be done when one of two or
more considerations Is unlawful, whether the promise be to do
one lawful act, or two or more acts part of which are unlawVOL. CLXXi-8

ful, because the whole consideration is the basis of the whole
promise. The parts are inseparable. Widoe v. Webb, 20

Bills, 94-.
"And in the same case it is said: ' Whilst a partial want
or failure of consideration avoids a bill or note only pro tanto,
illegality in respect to a part of the consideration avoids it in
toto. The reason of. this distinction is said to be founded,
partly at least, on grounds of public policy, and partly on the
technical notion that the security is entire and cannot be apportioned; and it has been said with mubh force, that where
parties have woven a web of fraud or wrong it is no part of
the duty of courts of justice to unravel the threads and separate the sound from the unsound;' citing Story on Prom.
Notes and Byles on Bill, spra, and then adds: 'And, in
general, it makes no difference as to the effect whether the
illegality be at common law 'or by statute.'"
This decision declares that when the consideration is illegal,
the promise fails; and to like effect are the other authorities
cited. But in the case at bar there is no illegality in the consideration. That was furnished by the bondholder in the old
bond, and that bond was the sole consideration. It is nowhere suggested that there was any vice or illegality in it;
that it was not a valid obligation of the State. When the
bondholder surrendered .that he furnished the entire consideration for the contract, and for that he received from the State
a promise. And as the Supreme Court of Ohio said in the
case above cited: "When, however, for a legal consideration,
a party undertakes to do -one or more acts, and some of them
are unlawful, the contract is good for so much as is lawful
and void fori the residue." The Court of Appeals concedes
that the promise made by the State to pay the interest is
valid, because made upon a good and lawful consideration.
Does it not logically follow that the promise of the State is
also good as to all other matters contained within it in respect

to which it might lawfully make a promise?

It prqmised to

receive the coupons "for all taxes, debts, dues and demands
due the State." That promise was necessarily for each tax
and debt, as well as for all taxes and debts. If it should so
happen that any single tax or debt cannot, under the constitution of the State, be lawfully discharged by the receipt of the
coupon, there is no difficulty in separating that part of the
contract from the balance. And as said by the Supreme
Court of Ohio: "Whenever the unlawful part of the contract
can be separated from the rest, it will be rejected and the
remainder established."
To like effect are the decisions of this court. In United
States v. Bradley, 10 Pet. 343, suit was brought on a paymaster's bond, and it was claimed that as some of the stipulations were in excess of those required by the statute and
illegally inserted, the whole bond was void. But the court
overruled the contention, saving (p. 360):
"That bonds and other deeds may, in many cases, be good
in part, and void for the residue, where the residue is founded
in illegality but hot malur in se, is a doctrine well founded
in the common law, and has been recognized from a very
early period. Thus in Pigot's case, 11 Co. Lit. 27b, it was
said that it was unanimously agreed in 14 Ien. VIII, 25, 26,
that if some of the covenants of an indenture, or of the conditions endorsed upon a bond, are against law, and some are
good and lawful, that in this case the covenants or conditions
which are against law are void ab initio and the others stand
good."
So in Gelpclce v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, this court said, in
reference to a similar contention in a suit on a contract made
by the officials of the city of Dubuque (p. 222):
"We have not, therefore, considered the questions which
they present. They relate to certain provisions. of the contract which are claimed to be invalid. Conceding this to be
so, they are clearly separable and severable from the other
parts which are relied upon. The rule in such cases, where
there is no imputation of malum in se, is that the bad parts
do not affect the good. The valid may be enforced."

OCTOBER TERMT; 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

We see no reason to change the views heretofore and often
expressed by this court, and reiterate, as said in 135 U. S.
668, "this question, therefore, must be considered as foreclosed, and no longer open for consideration."
Fourthly. It is urged that this court has no jurisdiction
of this case for the reason that the Court of Appeals in its
opinion does not consider the subsequent legislation passed by
the State with the view of impairing the contract created by
the act of 1871, but limits itself to a consideration of that
act, and adjudges it void. In support of this proposition the
rule laid down in Ilew Orleans Water IVors Co. v. Louisiana
Sugar-Refining Co., 125 U. S. 18, 38, reaffirmed in Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657, 681, and Bacon,v. Texas, 163
U. S. 207, 216, is cited.
In this last case the doctrine is summed up in the following
statement:
"Where the Federal question upon which the jurisdiction
of this court is based grows out of an alleged impairment of
the obligation of a contract, it is now definitely settled that
the contract can only be impaired within the meaning of this
clause in the Constitution, and so as to give this court jurisdiction on writ of error to a state court, by some subsequent
statute of the State which has been upheld or effect given it
by the state court. _Lehigh Mater Co. v. Easton, 121 U. S.
388; NArew Orleans Water IVores Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Refining Co., 125 U. S. 18; Central Land Co. v. -Laidley, 159
U. S. -103, 109.

.

If the judgment of the state court

gives no effect to the subsequent law of the State; and the
state court decides the case upon grounds independent of that
law, a case is not made for review by this court upon any
ground of the impairment of a contract. The above cited
cases announce this principle."
It is true the Court of Appeals in its opinion only incidentally refers to statutes passed subsequent to the act of 1871,
and places its decision distinctly on the ground that that act
was void in so far as it related to the coupon contract, but at
the same time it is equally clear that the judgment did give
effect to the subsequent statutes, and it has 'been repeatedly

. McCULLOUGH v. VIRGINIA.
Opinion of the Court.

held by this court that in reviewing the judgment of the
courts of a State we are not limited to a mere consideration,
of the language used in the opinion, but may examine and
determine what is the real substance. and effect of the -decision.
Suppose, for illustration, a state legislature should pass an
act exempting tfie property of a particular corporation from
all taxation, aud that a subsequent legislature should pass an
act subjecting that corporation io the taxes imposed by the
city in which its property was kcated, and that, on the first
.presentation to the highest court of the State of the question
of the validity of taxes levied under and by virtue of this last
act, that court should in terms hold these city taxes valid notwithstanding the general clause of exemption found in the
prior statute. In thAt event no one w,'uld question that this
court had jurisdiction to review such judgment, and inquire
as to the scope of the contract of exemption created by the
first statute. Suppose, further, that this court should hold
that the first statute was valid and broad enough to exempt
from all taxation, city as well as state, and adjudge the last
act of the legislature void as in conflict with the prior; and
that thereafter the city should again attempt to levy taxes
upon the corporation, and that upon a challenge of those
taxes the state court should say nothing in respect to the
last act, but simply rule that the original act exempting the
property of the corporation from taxation was void, could it
fairly be held that this court was without jurisdiction to
review that judgment, a judgment which directly and necessarily operated to give force and effect to the last statute
subjecting the property to city taxes? Could it be said that
the silence of the state court -in its opinion changed the scope
and effect of the decision? In other words, can it be that the
mere language in which the state court phrases its opinion
takes from or adds to the jurisdiction of this court to review
its judgment? Such a construction would always place it in
the power of a state court to determine our jurisdiction.
Such, certainly, has not been the understanding, and such
certainly would seem to set at naught the purpose of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

Federal Constitution to prevent a State from nullifying by its
legislation a contract which it has made, or authorized to be
made. In RHickie v. Starke, 1 Pet. 94, 98, Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the opinion of the court, said:
"In the construction of that section (the-twenty-fifth) the

court has never required that the treaty or act of Congress
under which the party claims, who brings the final judgment
of a state court into review before this court, should have
been pleaded specially or spread on the record. But it has
always been deemed essential to the exercise of jurisdiction
in such a case that the record should show a complete title
under the treaty or act of Congress, and that the judgment
of the court is in violation of that treaty or act."
And in Willson v. Blackbird Creek ftarsh Company, 2 Pet.
245, 250, the same Chief Justice also said:
"But we think it impossible to doubt that the constitutionality of the act was the question, and the only question, which
could have been discussed in the state court. That question
must have been discussed and decided.

.

. This court

has repeatedly decided in favor of its jurisdiction in such a
case. M~lartin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 3047; Mfiller v.
.Nichols, 4 Wheat. 311; and Williams v. N"orris, 12 Wheat.
117, are expressly in point. They establish, as far as precedents can establish anything, that it is 'not necessary to state
in terms on the record that the Constitution or a law of the
United States was drawn in question. It is sufficient to bring
the case within the provisions of the twenty-fifth section of
the judicial act, if the record shows that the Constitution or
a law or a treaty of the United States must have been misconstrued, or the decision could not be made. Or, as in this
case, that the constitutionality of a state law was questioned,
and the decision- has been in favor of the party claiming under
such law."
In Satterlee v. 3~fatthewson, 2 Pet. 380, 410, Mr. Justice
Washington observed:
"If it sufficiently appear from the record itself,
that the repugnancy of a statute of a State to the Constitution of the United States was drawn into question, or that

McCULLOUGH v. VIRGINIA.
Opinion of the Court

that question was applicable to the case, this court has jurisdiction of the cause under the section of the act referred to;
although the record should not, in terms, state a misconstruction of the Constitution of the United States, or that 'the
repugnancy of the statute of the State to any part of that
Constitution was drawn into question."
In Bridge Proprietor8v. Ioboken Company, 1 Wall..116, 143,
an act passed by the State in 1860 was claimed to be in violation of a contract created by an act of 1790, and it was said:
"Now, although there are other decisions in which it is
said that the point raised must appear on the record, and that
the particular act of Congress, or part of the Constitution
supposed to be infringed by the state law, ought to be pointed
out, it has never been held -that this should be done inexpress
words. But the true and rational rule is, that the court must
be able to see clearly, from the whole recoVd, that a certain
provision of the Constitution or act of Congress was relied on
by the party who brings the writ of error, and that the right
thus claimed by him was denied.

.

.

.

It is said, however,

that it is not the validity of the act of 1860 which is complained of by the plaintiffs, but the construction placed upon
that act by the state court. If this construction is one which
violates the plaintiffs' contract, and is the one on which the
.defendants are acting, it is clear that the plaintiffs have no
relief except in this court, and that this court will not be discharging its duty to see that no state legislature shall pass
a law impairing the obligation of a contract, unless it takes
jurisdiction of such cases2'
There are also some cases involving alleged contract exemptions from taxation which are worthy of notice. In Given v.
-Trig/d, 117 U. S. 648, 655, the plaintiff in error claimed to
hold real estate exempt from taxation by virtue of a contract
alleged to have been. contained in a law of the New Jersey
colonial legislature passed August 12, 1758. The validity'of
this exemption had been sustained in New Jeroey v. Wilson,
7 Cranch, 164, notwithstanding which for about' sixty years
before the assessment in question was laid taxes had been
regularly assessed upon the land and paid without objection.

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

The highest court of New Jersey Upheld the tax, on the
ground that the long acquiescence of the landowners raised
a presumption that the exemption which had once existed
had been surrendered. The jurisdiction of this court to review such judgment was sustained, the court saying:
"Where it is charged that the obligation of a contract has
been impaired by a state law, as in this case by the general
tax law of :New Jersey as administered by the state authorities, and the state courts justify such impairment by the application of some general rule of law to the facts of the case,
it is our duty to inquire whether the justification is Well
grounded. If it is not, the party is entitled to the benefit
of the constitutional protection."
In Ydzoo c~c. Railroadv. Thomas, 132 U. S. 174, 184, the
plaintiff in error was given by its charter, which became a
law on February 17, 1882, a certain exemption from taxation.
In 1888 the legislature passed an act for the collection of
taxes for past years, which by its terms was not applicable
to railroad companies exempt by law or charter from taxation. The Supreine Court of the State held that the plaintiff
was not entitled to the benefit of the exemption named in the
act of 1888. The jurisdiction of this court to review that
judgment was challenged. But the court, by the Chief Justice,
said:
"Although by the terms of the act of 1888 the taxes therein
referred to were not to be levied as against a railroad exempt
by law or charter, yet the Supreme Court held that this company is not exempt, and is embraced within the act; so that
if a contract of exemption is contained in the company's
charter, then the obligation of that contract is impaired by
the act of 1888, which must be considered, under the ruling
of the Supreme Court, as intended to apply to the company.
The result is the same, although the act of 1888 be regarded
as simply putting in forc'e revenue laws existing at the date
of the company's charter, rather than itself imposing taxes,
for if the contract existed those laws became inoperative, and
would be reinstated by the act of 1888. The motion to dismiss the writ of error is therefore overruled."

McCULLOUGH v. VIRGINIA.
Opinion of the Court.

Weldon. Railroad v. Alsroo, 146 U. S.
Tc
In Tilmigtonr
279, 293, the state court, conceding the validity of a contract
of exemption from taxation, held that certain property was
not within its terms, and on this ground a motion to dismiss
the writ of error was made by the defendant. In respect to
that the Chief Justice said:
"The jurisdiction of this court is questioned, upon the.
ground that the decision of the Supreme Court of North
Carolina conceded the validity of the contract of exemption
contained in the act of 18341, but denied that that particular
property was embraced by its terms; and that, therefore, such
decision did not involve a Federal question.
"In arriving at its conclusions, however, the state court gave
effect to the revenue law of 1891, and held that the contract
did not confer the right of exemption from its operation. If
it did, its obligation was impaired by the subsequent law, and
as the inquiry whether it did or not was necessarily directly
passed upon, we are of opinion that the writ of error was
properly allowed."
In .Mobile & Ohio Railroad v. Tennessee, 153 U. S. 486,
492, 493, 'Mr. Justice Jackson, reviewing prior decisions, said:
"It is well settled that the decision of a state court holding
that, as a matter of construction, a particular charter or a charter provision does not constitute a contract, is not binding on
this court. The question of the existence or non-existence of a
contract in cases like the present is one which this colrt will
determine for itself, the established rule being that where the
judgment of the highest court of a State, by its terms or
necessary operation, gives effect to some provisions of the
state law which is claimed by the unsuccessful party to impair the contract set out and relied on, this court has jurisdiction to determine the question whether such a contract exists
as claimed, and whether the state law complained of impairs
its obligation."
In.the case before us, after the act of 1871, and in 1872, the
general assembly passed an act requiring that all taxes should
be paid in "gold or silver coin, United States Treasury notes,
or notes of the national banks of the United States;" and

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

again, in 1882, a further statute commanding tax collectors to
receive in payment of taxes "gold, silver, United States Treasury notes, national bank currency, and nothing else." This
command was'rednacted in the Code of 1887. Under these
statutes the State demanded payment of its taxes in money
and repudiated its promise to receive coupons in lieu thereof.
True, in its opinion, the Court of Appeals. did not specifically
refer to these statutes, but by declaring that the contract provided for in the act of 1871 iias void it did give full force and
effect to them, as well as to the general revenue law of the
State. Now, it is one of the duties cast upon this court by
the Constitution and laws of the United .States to ifluire6
whether a State has passed any law impairing the obligation
of a prior contract. No duty is more solemn and imperative
than this, and it seems to us that we should be recreant to
that duty if we should permit the form in which a state court
expresses its conclusions to override the necessary effect of
its decision.
It must also be borne in mind that this is not a case in
whichb, after a statute asserted to be the foundation of a contract, acts are passed designed and tending to destroy or impair
the alleged contract rights, and the first time the questidn is
presented to the highest court of the State it.takes no notice
of the subsequent acts, but inquiires simply as to the validity
of the alleged contract. Here it appears that the state courts
had repeate*dly held the.act claimed to create a contract valid,
and had passed upon the validity of subsequent acts designed
and calculated to destroy and impair the rights given by such
contract sustaining some, and. annulling others. Some of
those judgments had been brought to this court, and by it
the validity of the original act had been uniformly and repeatedly sustained, and the invalidity of subsequent and conflicting acts adjudged, and now at the end of many years of
litigation, with these subsequent statutes still standing on the
statute books unrepealed by any legislative action, the state
court, with only a casual reference to those later statutes, goes
back to the original act, and, reversing its prior rulings, adjudges it void, thus in effect putting at naught the repeated

:McCULLOUGI

v. VIRGINIA.

Opinion of the Court.

decisions of this court as well as its own. Under such circumstances it seems to us that it would be a clear evasion of the
duty cast upon us by the Constitution of the United States to
treat all this past litigation and prior decisions as mere nullities and to consider the question as a matter de novo. It
would be shutting our eyes to palpable facts to say that the
Court of Appeals of Virginia has not by this decision given
effect to these subsequent statutes.
Finally, it ig urged that since the judgment in the trial court
and prior to the decision in the Court of Appeals the general
assembly of the State of Virginia passed the act of February 21, 1894, c. 381, Acts General Assembly, 1893-94, p. 381,
in terms repealing the statute authorizing this particular form
of suit ; that no State can be sued without its own consent;
that such consent has thus been withdrawn, and therefore the
whole proceeding abates and this suit must be dismissed. It
is true that such an act was passed, and that in Maury v.
Commonwealth, 92 Virginia, 310, its validity was sustained by
the Court of Appeals, but the judgment in this case -did
not go upon the effect of that repealing statute. It was not
noticed in the opinion, and the decision was not that the
suit abate by reason of the repeal of the statute authorizing
it, but that the judgment of the trial court be -reversed, and
a new judgment be entered against the petitioner for costs.
If the action had abated it was error to render judgment
against him for costs.
But there are more substantial reasons than this for not
entertaining this motion. At the time the judgment was
rendered in the Circuit Court of the city of Norfolk the act
of 1882 was in force, and the judgment was rightfully entered
under the authority of that act. The writ of error to the
Couit of Appeals of the State brought the validity of that
judgment into review, and the question presented to that
court was whether at the time it was rendered it was rightful
or not. If rightful the plaintiff therein had a vested right
which no state legislation could disturb.
It is not within
the power of a legislature to take away rights which have
been once vested by a judgment. Legislation may act on

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.
Opinion of the Court.

subsequent proceedings, may abate actions pending, but when
those actions have passed into judgment the power of the
legislature to disturb the rights created thereby ceases. So,
properly, the Court of Appeals, in considering the question
of the validity of this judgment, took no notice of the subsequent repeal of the act under which the judgment was
obtained, and the inquiry in this court is not what effect the
repealing act of 1894 had upon proceedings initiated thereafter, or pending at the time, but whether such a repeal
divested a plaintiff in a judgment of the rights acquired by
that judgment. And in that respect we have no doubt that
the rights acquired by the judgment under the act of 1882
were not disturbed by a subsequent repeal of the statute.
Even if the repeal had preceded the judgment in the trial
court, or if in a proceeding like this, equitable in its nature,
the mere taking of the case to the Court of Appeals operated
to vacate the decree, there would still remain a serious question. When the act of 1871 was passed the coupon holder
had a remedy by writ of mandamus to compel the acceptance
of his coupons in payment of taxes. The form and mode
.of proce.eding were prescribed by statute. Code Virginia,
c. 151, 1873, p. 1023. On January 14, 1882, the general
assembly passed the act providing a new remedy for the
coupon holder. This act came before this court in Antoni
v. Greenhow, 107 U. S. 769, 774, and was sustained, the court
holding that while it is true that, "as a general rule, laws
applicable to the case which are in force at the time and
place of making a contract enter into and form part of the
contract itself, and ' that this embrace-, alike those laws which
affect its validity, construction, discharge and enforcement,'
IWalker v. Whitehead, 16 Wall. 314, 317," "it is equally well
settled that changes in the forms of action and modes of proceeding do not amount to an impairment of the obligations
of a contract, if an adequate and efficacious remedy is left."
Upon this ground it was held that the new remedy being
adequate and efficacious, the taking away of the old right of
proceeding by mandamus was valid, and the coupon holder
must be content with the new remedy.. Now the statute

Dissenting Opinion: Peckham, J.

creating this new remedy was, as we have seen, repealed by
the act of 1894. That act does not in terms revive the former
remedy. Indeed, the riglt to use the writ of mandamus in
tax cases was specifically taken away, after the act of January 14, 1882, by the act of January 26, 1882. It was said,
however, in the argument of counsel that the former remedy
was one arising under the common law, and that the settled
law of Virginia is that when an act is passed repealing an
act creating * statutory remedy it operates to revive the
former common law remedy. 1ns. Co. v. Barley's Administrator,16 Gratt. 363; Booth v. Commonwealth, 16 Gratt. 519,
and .Iosely, Trustee, v. Brown, 76 Virginia, 419. If this be
still the law of Virginia and applicable to the case at bar, so
that the repeal of the act of 1882 revives the former remedy
by mandamus, then it is undoubtedly true that new suits can'
no longer be maintained under the act of 1882, and a party
must proceed by mandamus. But that is a question yet to be
settled by the Court of Appeals of Virginia. It is not decided in the case of .aury v. Commonwealth, supra, and, so
far as we have been advised, has not yet been determined
by that court. If it shall finally be held by that court that.
the remedy by mandamus does not exist, then it will become
a question for further consideration whether the act repealing
the act of 1882 can be sustained. But it is not necessary now
to determine that question, inasmuch as the judgment in the
trial court was rendered, as we have seen, prior to the repealing act, and the right acquired by the judgment creditor was
not and could not constitutionally be taken away.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals will be reversed and
the case remandedforfurther proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.

I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court in

have no jurisdiction to reexamine its judgment unless there is
some Federal question involved therein, the decision of which
by the court below was unfavorable to the claim set up, and
its decision was necessary to the determination of the case, or
the judgment as rendered could not have been given without
deciding it. Eustis v. Bolles, 150 13. S. 361.
Jurisdiction is said .to exist herein because of the alleged
violation of the constitutional provision denying to any State
the right to pass any law impairing the obligation of a contract.
In all the litigation arising in the state courts, by reason of
the subsequent legislation by Virginia upon the subject, the
claim was made, on a review of the judgments in this court,
that the judgments of the state courts had given effect to
statutes which were passed subsequently to the original coupon
statutes, and that the original contract made by those statutes
had been impaired by reason of those subsequent statutes to
which effect was given by the judgments of the state courts.
It was -the giving effect by the judgment of the court to the
subsequent statutes, which it was alleged impaired the contract, that gave jurisdiction to this court to decide for itself
whether there was a contract, and, if so, what the contract
was, as a preliminary to the decision of the question whether
the subsequent statutes impaired the contract as construed
by this court. The cases in which this court decides for itself,
without reference to the decision of the state court, what the
contract was,.are cases where there has been not only subsequent legislation which is alleged to impair the contract, but
also legislation which has been given some effect to by the
judgment of the state court. Such is the case of JeffersoMn
BrancJ BRank v. Skelly, 1 Black, 486, 44:3, and such are all
the other cases decided in this court upon that subject.
If by the judgment of the state court in this case no effect
has been given to any statute passed subsequently to either of
the coupon acts, this court is without jurisdiction to review
that judgment. Lehigh Water Company v. Easton, 121 U. S.
388; .New Orleans Waterworks Company v. Louisiana Sugar
Refining Company, 125 U. S. 18; St. Paul &c. Railway

v. Todd County, 142 U. S. 282; Central Land Company v.
Laidley, 159. U. S. 103; Bacon v. Texas, 163 U. S. 207.
If there had never been any subsequent legislation regarding these coupon acts, and the highest court of the State had
adjudged that they were void as being in violation of the constitution of the State existing at the time of their passage, of
course there would be no jurisdiction in this court to review
that judgment. And the state court might have decided the
case in different ways, at one time holding the acts valid and
subsequently holding them void, and still this court would
have no jurisdiction to reexamine the judgments of that court.
This would be true even if millions of dollars had been invested in the bonds upon the strength of the judgment of the
state court first given holding the acts valid.
The cases above cited show that even if there has been subsequent legislation, if the judgment of the state court does
not give that legislation any effect, and decides the case without reference thereto, this court is also without jurisdiction to
review that judgment.
I do not say that in order to give this court jurisdiction, the
state court must in words allude to the subsequent legislation
and in terms give effect to it. It may be assumed that if the
real substance and necessary effect of the judgment of the
state court was the determination of a Federal question or
the giving effect to subsequent legislation, this court would
have jurisdiction to review that judgment, notwithstanding
the particular language used in the opinion. But when the
case before the state court could have been decided upon two
distinct grounds, one only of which embraced a Federal
question, the sole way of determining upon which of' those
grounds the judgment was rested would be to examine the
language used in the opinion of the state court. If that language showed the judgment was founded wholly upon a nonFederal question, this court would-be without power to review
it. Whether the state court has decided this case wholly
without reference to subsequent legislation can only be
learned from its opinion. To this extent it has always been
within the power of the state court to determine the jurisdic-

tion of this court. If the former court chooses to decide a
case upon, a non-Federal question, when it might have decided
it upon one which was Federaf in its nature, the effect of such
choice is to deprive this court of jurisdiction, no matter how
erroneous we may regard the decision of the state tribunal.
The power is with the state court in such cbses.to deprive us
of jurisdiction to review its determination, and, we are wholly
without any power to control its action in that respect. This
is what.has been done, and all that has been done, in this case.
The opinion of the state court shows that the judgment went
upon the original and inherent invalidity of the coupon
statutes and its judgment in that respect, as I shall hereafter
attempt to show, gave no effect to any subsequent legislation.
That is the material question in this case upon which the
jurisdiction of this court hangs. Prior decisions of this
court in other cases holding the contract valid, where we had
jurisdiction to determine such cases, can have no effect upo4
the question of our jurisdiction to review the judgment in the
case at bar. Prior decisions in such event constitute no
ground of jurisdiction.
I concede, plainly and fully, the power of this court to
review a judgment of the state court when effect has been
given by that judgment to subsequent legislation claimed to
impair the validity of a contract. But that vital fact must
appear in order to support the jurisdiction, and without it the
jurisdiction does not exist, no matter how important the
question may be or how many times it may have been heretofore decided.
To say that the duty is cast upon this court to inquire
whether a State has passed a law impairing the obligations of
a prior dontract is but to half state the case The inquiry
must be further prosecuted to the extent of learning whether
the state court has, by its judgment, given effect to such
subsequent legislation, and, if it has not, then no duty or.right
rests upon this court to review the judgment.
However true it may be that in many prior cases this court
has held there was a valid contract created by. the coupon
statutes, so called, which could not be impaired by any sub-

Dissenting Opinion: -Peekham, J.

sequent legislation, the fact remains that unless such subsequent legislation has been given effect to by the judgmentin this case, there is not the slightest shadow of a claim for
jurisdiction in this court to review that judgment. Millions
or hundreds of millions of dollars may have been invested in
reliance upon a judgment of this court declaring the law to be
that there was a valid contract, and yet a state court might
in a subsequent action adjudge that there never was a valid
contract, because the statute which it was claimed created it
was in violation of the state constitution. If that judgment
did not, in effect, put in operation any subsequent legislation,
the solemn adjudications of this court in some former cases
that the contract was valid, could not affect the judgment in
question nor furnish ground for the jurisdiction of this court
to review that judgment. This court is not entrusted with
the duty of supervising all decisions of state courts to the end
that we may see to it that such decisions are never inconsistent, contradictory or conflicting. We supervise those decisions
only when a Federal question arises. It is said this court is
not bound to follow the last decision of a state court reversing
its prior rulings upon a question of the validity of a contract,
when bonds have been issued and taken in reliance upon the
decision of the state court adjudging the 'validity of the law
under which the bonds were issued. I do not dispute the
proposition, but it has nothing to do with this case. Where
an action has been brought under such circumstances in a
Federal court, it has been frequently held that such court was
not bound to follow the latest decision of the state court
which invalidated the law under which bonds had been issued,
at a time When the state. court bad held the law valid. In
such case the Federal court would follow the prior decision of
the state court and apply it to all the securities which had
been issued prior to the time when the state court changed
its decision. But such a case raises no question of jurisdiction
in this court to review the judgment of a state court. When
that question of jurisdiction does arise, the right of review
cannot rest upon the fact that the state court has refused to
follow its former decision, and, on the contrary, has directly

overruled it. The jurisdiction of this court' to review the
state court in this class of cases is confined in the first instance to an inquiry as to the existence of subsequent legislation upon the subject, and if none has been enacted to which
any effect has been given by the state court, this court cannot
review the decision of the state tribunal, even though that
decision makes worthless a contract which it had prior thereto
held valid.
* The cases of Gelpoke v. City of Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, and
Rairoad 0omgany v. .MeClure, 10 Wall. 511, illustrate this
difference between the powers of this court when reviewing
a- judgment of a lower Federal court and its powers when
revie.wing a judgment of a state court.
In this class of cases the ahbsolutely unbending and essential
fact which must exist, in order to give jurisdiction to review a
judgment of a state court, is subsequent legislation to which
effect has been given by the judgment of the state court.
This court is not the Mecca to which all dissatisfied suitors in
the state courts may turn for the correction of all the errors
said to have been committed by the state tribunals. Nor is it
confided to this court to supervise the 'judgments of a state
court in all cases where we may think that court has by its
later decision invalidated a contract which it had once held to
be lwful, and the judgment in which this court had upheld.
The right of the state court in another case to reverse its
former ruling is wholly unaffected by the fact that its former
judgment had been affirmed here. Unless the Federal question
exists in this case there is no ground of jurisdiction' founded
upon any prior decisions.
Now, has this judgment of the state court given effect to
any subsequent legislation ? At the time of the passage of
the coupon acts there was no prior statute in Virginia permitting taxes to be paid in coupons of any kind whatever.
The sole authority for such attempted payment of taxes rested
in the coupon statutes under consideration. If they gave no
such authority, then none existed, and no payment of taxes
by means of coupons was valid. This is wholly irrespective
of the subsequent acts. The state court has held the coupon

131

acts to be entirely void, because in violation of the state constitution in existence when they were passed. Under that
decision those acts are to all intents and purposes as if they
never had been passed. They therefore furnished not the
slightest form of legality to a payment of taxes in coupons.
It was not a statute to forbid paying taxes in coupons that
was necessary in order to deprive such payments of legality.
A statute, a valid statute authorizing such payment, was necessary in the first instance, and if there were no such statute
there was no authority existing to receive coupons in payment
of taxes. The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, in a
case in which it had jurisdiction, decided there was no such
statute, and consequently no such authority, because the statute purporting to confer that authority was void, as in violation of the constitution of the State. This judgment did not
give the slightest effect to the legislation subsequent to the
coupon statutes. It simply held there were no coupon statutes, because those which purported to be such were totally
void. No subsequent statute was necessary, and none such
was given effect to. Striking down the coupon statutes effectually destroyed any assumed right to pay taxes in coupons,
and the subsequent legislation was needless and ineffectual.
Thus the whole groundwork upon which to base our jurisdiction in this case falls to the ground, and we are left to maintain it upon the insufficient claim of prior decisions of this
court.
In truth, the particular question, decided in this case has
never been before this court. In some of the former cases
this court decided the general proposition that the coupon
legislation was valid and created a contract. After it had
thus decided, a case came before it where a subsequent statute
provided. that, in the case of the school tax, coupons should
not be received in payment thereof. The state court had decided that the coupon statute was invalid so far as it related
to the school tax, because the constitution in existence when
the coupon acts were passed required in substance that such
tax must be paid in lawful money, and consequently the
coupon act was unconstitutional as to such tax. This court

OCTOBER TERM, 1898.

affirmed that judgment. Tashon v. Greenhow, 135 U. S. 662,
713. Part of the coupon statute was thus held invalid by the
state court and also by this court.
The State had also passed a subsequent -statute providing
that the tax for a license to retail liquor should be paid .in lawful money. This court (affirming'in that respedt the court below) held that act valid, because it was in effect a regulation
of the liquor traffic, and the State could at all times legislate
upon that subject, notwithstanding the coupon acts and the
alleged contract therein created. luele v. Childrey, 135
U. S. 662, 709. Both of these .decisions were made subsequently to the time when.this court had held the coupon statute valid, and that a valid contract was therein created.
The state court has now decided in this case that as the
coupon acts were invalid as to the payment of the school tax
in coupons, (a proposition concurred in by this court,) the
result was that the whole acts were invalid, that they could
not stand partly valid and partly void, and that the whole
coupon scheme was unconstitutional. This phase of the controver~y hlas never before reached this court, and the court has
therefore never before decidedthis particular point. It has
said, generally, that the legislation was valid, but it said so
only in cases where the general power of the legislature to
enact the coupon statutes was in question, and it has never
decided squarely the point that if the coupon acts be unconstitutional in some particulars they are nevertheless valid in all
others. The fact is alluded to simply as a matter of history.
But even if it had, that fact confers no jurisdiction upon
this court to review this judgment, if it otherwise is without
it. In other words, because this court has heretofore decided
the question of the validity of the contract, in cases where it
had jurisdiction, that fact furnishes no foundation for its jurisdiction in this case, where the state court has given no effect
to any subsequent legislation. Prior decision is not the foundation of jurisdiction. What i say is, that whether there have
'been two or more decisions, is wholly immaterial; jurisdiction cannot be taken because it is said that in a second or subsequent decisiofi the state court did niot follow its -first decision

Syllabus.

in regard to the contract, although that decision had been
affirmed, as to that point, by this court. In this decision now
before us it has given no effect to subsequent legislation, and
not having done so, but simply decided a question of local law
regarding its own constitution, the state court has given no
decision which raises a Federal question, and therefore none
that this court can review.
Under all the circumstances I can only see a determination
to take jurisdiction in this case simply because this court, as it
is said, has in cases in which it had jurisdiction decided the
question differently from the decision in this case by the state
court. That ground does not give jurisdiction, and that is the
only ground that does exist:
The writ of error should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
