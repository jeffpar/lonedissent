and knew that speculating was something unfavorable as to
Schardt's habits; and the president of course knew that the
matters concerning him, of which he had beard, were such as
it was advisable for the company to-make inquiry about. True,
the second question was if he had heard of matters about which
he deemed it advisable for the company to inquire and the word
"deem" might be said to give a considerable discretion, but it
was not a discretion to be abused. That the company would
consider it advisable to make inquiry is too plain for argument.
The whole tenor of the bond renders any other conclusion impossible.

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
CERTIORARI TO THE OIROUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD
CIRCUIT.
No. 303. Argued November 15,18, 1901.-Decided January 6, 1902.

Alexandroff, a conscript in the Russian naval service, was sent as one of a
detail of fifty-three men to Philadelphia, to become a part of the crew
of a Russian cruiser then under construction at that port.

On his ar-

rival at Philadelphia, the vessel was still upon the stocks, but was shortly
thereafter launched, and continued for some months in the water still
under construction. Alexandroff, who had remained during the winter
at Philadelphia in the service and under the pay of the Russian Government, deserted the following spring, went to New York, renounced his
allegiance to the Emperor, declared his intention of becoming a citizen of
the United States, and obtained employment. Shortly thereafter, he
was arrested as a deserter from a Russian ship of war, and committed to

prison, subject to the orders of the Russian Vice Consul or commander
of the cruiser. On writ of habeas corpus, it was held:

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
Statement of the Case.
(1) That although the cruiser was not a ship when Alexandroff arrived
at Philadelphia, she became such upon being launched;
(2) That, under the treaty with Russia of 1832, in virtue of which these
proceedings were taken, she was a ship of war as distinguished
from a merchant vessel, notwithstanding she had not received her
equipment or armament, and was still unfinished;
(3) That, under her contract of construction, she was from the beginning, and continued to be, the property of the Russian Government,
and was, therefore, a Russian ship of war, notwithstanding she
had not received her crew on board, nor been commissioned for
active service, and was still in process of completion;
(4) That Alexandroff, having been detailed to her service, was, from the
time she became a ship, a part of her crew within the meaning
of the treaty;
(5) That the exhibition of official documents, showing that he was a
member of her crew, had been waived by his admissions.
While desertion is not a crime provided for in our ordinary extradition
treaties with foreign nations, the arrest and return to their ships of deserting seamen is required by our treaty with Russia and by other treaties with foreign nations. Query: Whether in the absence of a treaty,
courts have power to order the arrest and return of seamen deserting
from foreign ships ?
While foreign troops entering or passing through our territory with the
permission of the Executive are exempt from territorial jurisdiction, it
is doubtful whether in the absence of a treaty or positive legislation to
that effect, there is any power to apprehend or return deserters.
The treaty with Russia containing a convention upon that subject, such
convention is the only basis upon which the Russian Government can lay
a claim for the arrest of deserting seamen. The power contained in the
treaty cannot be enlarged upon principles of comity to embrace cases not
contemplated by it.
A treaty is to be interpreted liberally and in such manner as to carry out
its manifest purpose.
A ship becomes such when she is launched, and continues to be such so
long as her identity is preserved: From the moment she takes the water,
she becomes the subject of admiralty jurisdiction.
A seaman becomes one of the crew of a merchant vessel from the time he
signs the shipping articles, and of a man of war from the time he is detailed to her service.

Tnis was a writ of habeas corpus issued upon the petition of
Alexandroff, to inquire into the cause of his detention by Robert C. Motherwell, keeper of the Philadelphia County Prison,
and Captain Vladimir Behr, master of the Russian cruiser

taned upon a commissioner's warrant, issued upon the affidavit
of Captain Behr, to the effect that he was a duly engaged seaman of the Russian cruiser Variag, whose term of service had
not expired; and that he had on or before April 25, 1900, deserted from said vessel, without any intention of returning
thereto. Petitioner further averred that on May 24, 1900, he
had declared his intention before the proper authorities to become a citizen of the United States, and to renounce his allegiance to the Emperor of Russia, of whom he was then a subject; that he had never deserted the Variag and had "never
set his foot on that vessel as a seaman thereof."
In return to the writ the superintendent of the county prison
produced the body of Alexandroff, with a copy of the commitment by a United States commissioner, stating that he had
been "charged" on oath with desertion from the Variag, and
"apprehended" upon a warrant issued by the commissioner at
the request of the vice-consul, in accordance with the terms of
a treaty between the United States and Russia. There was no
statement that an examination had been had before the commissioner, and the warrant did not commit him for examination, but "subject to the order of the Russian vice-consul at
Philadelphia or of the master of the cruiser Variag, or until he
shall be discharged by the due course of law." The commitment is reproduced in full in the margin. 1

Opinion of the Court.

Upon a hearing upon the writ, the return thereto and the
evidence, the District Court was of opinion, first, that the Variag was not, at the time the petitioner left the service, a Russian
ship of war, but simply an unfinished vessel intended for a
Russian cruiser; second, that petitioner had not become a member of her crew; .that the vessel had no crew in the sense intended by the treaty, inasmuch as the men assigned to that
duty had not yet begun that service and might never be called
upon to perform it; third, that no such documentary evidence
of petitioner's enlistment as a member of the crew, as was required by the treaty, had been offered.
It was accordingly ordered that the prisoner be discharged
from custody. 103 Fed. Rep. 198.
An appeal was taken from this order to the Circuit Court of
Appeals, in which court the district attorney entered his appearance and filed a suggestion that, under the facts of the
case, the relator should be remanded to the county prison to
await the order of Captain Behr, the master of the Variag.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

Appeals were agreed in the opinion that neither under terms of
the treaty of 1832 with Russia nor upon principles of international comity could the relator be delivered over to the master
of the Variag as a deserter.
In committing him to the Philadelphia County Prison, the
commissioner acted in pursuance of Rev. Stat. sec. 5280, which
provides as follows: "SEc. 5280. On application of a consul or
vice-consul of any foreign government having a treaty with
the United States stipulating for the restoration of seamen deserting, made in writing, stating that the person therein named
has deserted from a vessel of any such government, while in
any port of the United States, and on proof by the exhibition
of the register of the vessel, ship's roll, or other official document, that the person named belonged, at the time of desertion, to the crew of such vessel, it shall be the duty of any
court, judge, commissioner of any Circuit Court, justice, or
other magistrate, having competent power, to issue warrants to
cause such person to be arrested for examination." The procedure is then set forth.
The facts were, in substance, that Alexandroff entered the
Russian naval service as a conscript, in 1896, at the age of seventeen, and was assigned to the duties of an assistant physician.
Some time in October, 1899, an officer and a detail of fifty-three
men, among whom was Alexandroff, were sent from Russia to
Philadelphia to take possession of and man the Variag, then
under construction by the firm of Cramp & Sons, in that city.
The Variag was still upon the stocks when the men arrived in
Philadelphia. She was, however, launched in October or November, 1899, and at the time Alexandroff deserted was lying
in the stream still under construction, not yet having been accepted by the Russian government. Alexandroff left Philadelphia without leave April 20, 1899, went to New York, and there
renounced his allegiance to the Emperor of Russia, declaring his
intentions of becoming a citizen of the United States. He was
subsequently arrested upon the written request of the Russian
vice-consul, and on June 1, 1900, was committed upon a mittimus stating that he had been charged with desertion from the
Imperial Russian crusier Variag, upon the complaint of the

captain, in accordance with the terms of the treaty between the
United States and Russia.
The vice-consul, who prosecutes this appeal on behalf of the
Russian government, relies chiefly upon Art. IX of the treaty
of December, 1832, which reads as follows (8 Stat. 444): "The
said Consuls, Vice-Consuls and Commercial Agents are authorized to require the assistance of the local authorities, for the
search, arrest, detention and imprisonment of the deserters from
the ships of war and merchant vessels of their country. For
this purpose they shall apply to the competent tribunals, judges
and officers, and shall in writing demand said deserters, proving
by the exhibition of the registers of the vessels, the rolls of the
crews, or by other official documents, that such individuals
formed part of the crews; and, this reclamation being thus substantiated, the surrender shall not be refused." Sections VIII
and IX of the treaty, which cover the whole subject of deserting seamen, are reproduced in the margin.'
1 TREATY WITH RUSSIA, 1832.

Art. VIII.
The Consuls, Vice-Consuls and Commercial Agents shall have the right,
as such, to sit as judges and arbitrators in such differences as may arise between the captains and crews of the vessels belonging to the nation whose
interests are committed to their charge, without the interference of the
local authorities, unless the conduct of the crews or of the captain should
disturb the order of the tranquility of the country or the said Consuls, ViceConsuls or Commercial Agents should require their assistance to cause
their decisions to be carried into effect or supported. It is, however, understood that this species of judgment or arbitration shall not deprive the contending parties of the right they have to resort, on their return, to the
judicial authority of their country.
Art. IX.
The said Consuls, Vice-Consuls and Commercial Agents are authorized
to require the assistance of the local authorities for the search, arrest, detention and imprisonment of the deserters from the ships of war and merchant
vessels of their country. For this purpose they shall apply to the competent
tribunals, judges and officers, and shall in writing demand said deserters,
proving, by the exhibition of the registers of the vessels, the rolls of the
crews, or by any other official documents, that such individuals formed
part of the crews; and this reclamation being thus substantiated, the surrender shall not be refused.
Such deserters, when arrested, shall be placed at the disposal of the said

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

While desertion is not a crime provided for by any of our
numerous extradition treaties with foreign nations, the arrest
and return to their ships of deserting seamen is no novelty either
in treaties, legislation or general international jurisprudence.
The ninth article of the treaty with the government of France,
entered into November 14, 1788, before the adoption of the
Constitution, contained a stipulation that "the Consuls and
Vice-Consuls may cause to be arrested the captains, officers,
mariners, sailors and all other persons, being part of the crews
of the vessels of their respective nations, who shall have deserted from the said vessels, in order to send them back and
transport them out of the country," specifying the procedure.
8 Stat. 106, 112. The same provision was contained in subsequent treaties with France, of June 24, 1822, and February 23,
1853, and it was to carry these and similar treaties into effect
that the act of 1829, reproduced in Rev. Stat. sec. 5280, was
adopted. Similar conventions were entered into with Brazil in
1828, -Mexico in 1831, Chili in 1832, Greece in 1837, Bolivia in
1858, Austria in 1870, Belgium in 1880, and at different times
with some seventeen or eighteen other powers, and finally by a
special treaty with Great Britain, ratified June 3, 1892. In
short, it may be said that with the exception of China, the
Argentine Republic, and possibly a few others, there is not a
maritime nation in the world with which we have not entered
into a convention for the arrest and delivery over of deserting
seamen. The multitude of these conventions is such as to indicate a pressing necessity that masters of vessels should have
some recourse to local laws to prevent their being entirely
stripped of their crews in foreign ports.
A like provision for the arrest and delivery over of seamen
deserting from domestic vessels, adopted by the first Congress
Consuls, Vice-Consuls or Commercial Agents, and may be confined in the
public prisons, at the request and cost of those who shall claim them, in
order to be detained until the time when they shall be restored to the vessels to which they belong, or sent back to their own country by a vessel of
the same nation or any other vessel whatsoever. But if not sent back
within four months from the day of their arrest, they shall be set at liberty,
and shall not be again arrested for the same cause.

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
Opinion of the Court.

in 1790, 1 Stat. 131, 134, was sustained by this court in Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U. S. 275, and remained upon the statute
books for over a hundred years, when it was finally repealed in
1898. 30 Stat. 755, 764.
We are cited to no case holding that courts have the power,
in the absence of treaty stipulations, to order the arrest and return of seamen deserting from foreign ships; and it would appear there was no such power in this country, inasmuch as
sec. 5280, under which the commissioner is bound to proceed,
limits his jurisdiction to applications by a consul or vice-consul
of a foreign government "having a treaty with the United
States" for that purpose.
In Moore on Extradition, (sec. 408,) it is laid down as a general proposition that, in the absence of a treaty, the surrender
of deserting seamen cannot be granted by the authorities of the
United States; and. an opinion of Attorney General Cushing,
(6 Op. 148,) is cited upon that point. There is also another to
the same effect. (6 Op. 209.) It is believed that in all the instances which arose between the United States and Great
Britain prior to the treaty of 1892 for the reclamation of deserting seamen, both powers have taken the position that in the
absence of a treaty there can be no reclamation. Several instances of this kind are cited by Mr. Moore in his treatise.
In the case of the United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S.407,
it was held that, apart from the provisions of treaties upon the
subject, there was no well-defined obligation on the part of one
country to deliver up fugitives from justice to another, "and
though such delivery was often made, it was upon the principle
of comity, and within the discretion of the government whose
action was invoked, and it has never been recognized as among
those obligations of one government towards another which
rest upon established principles of international law."
The only case in our reports even indirectly considering such
a case as one of international comity is that of The Exchange,
7 Cranch, 116. This was a libel for possession promoted by
the former owners of the Exchange, who alleged that she had
been seized under the orders of Napoleon and in violation of the
law of nations; that no decree of condemnation had been pro-

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

nounced against her, but that she remained the property of the
libellants.
The district attorney filed a suggestion to the effect that the
vessel, whose name had been changed, belonged to the Emperor
of the French, and while actually employed in his service was
compelled, by stress of weather, to enter the port of Philadelphia for repairs; that if the vessel had ever belonged to the
libellants, their title was divested according to the decrees and
laws of France in such case provided. The District Judge dismissed the libel upon the ground that a public armed vessel of
a foreign sovereign in amity with our government is not subject
to the ordinary judicial tribunals of our country, so far as regards the question of title, by which such sovereign holds the
vessel.
On appeal, this court, through Mr. Chief Justice Marshall,
held that the decree of the District Court should be affirmed;
that the "perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns, and this common interest impelling them to mutual
intercourse, and an interchange of good offices with each other,
have given rise to a class of cases in which every sovereign is
understood to waive the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction, which has been stated to be the
attribute of every nation." He divided these cases into three
classes :
1. The exemption of the person of the sovereign from arrest
or detention in a foreign country.
2. The immunity which all civilized nations allow to foreign
ministers.
3. Where the sovereign allows the troops of a foreign prince
to pass through his dominions.
In respect to this last class he observed: "In such case, without any express declaration waiving jurisdiction over the army
to which this right of passage has been granted, the sovereign
who should attempt to exercise it would certainly be considered
as violating his faith. By exercising it, the purpose for which
the free passage was granted would be defeated, and a portion
of the military force of a foreign independent nation would be
diverted from those national objects and duties to which it was

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
Opinion of the Court.

applicable, and would be withdrawn from the control of the
sovereign whose power and whose safety might greatly depend
on retaining the exclusive command and disposition of this
force. The grant of a free passage, therefore, implies a waiver
of all jurisdiction over the troops during their passage, and
permits the foreign general to use that discipline, and to inflict
those punishments which the goverment of his army may require."
In this connection he held that there was a distinction between a military force which could only enter a foreign territory by permission of the sovereign, and a public armed vessel,
which upon principles of international comity is entitled to
enter the ports of any foreign country with which her own
country is at peace. He farther observed: "If there be no
prohibition, the ports of a friendly nation are considered as
open to the public ships of all powers with whom it is at peace,
and they are supposed to enter such ports, and to remain in
them while allowed to remain under the protection of the government of the place." It was upon this ground that the court
held the Exchange exempt from seizure.
This case, however, only holds that the public armed vessels
of a foreign nation may, upon principles of comity, enter our
harbors with the presumed license of the government, and while
there are exempt from the jurisdiction of the local courts; and,
by parity of reasoning, that, if foreign troops are permitted to
enter, or cross our territory, they are still subject to the control
of their officers and exempt from local jurisdiction.
The case, however, is not authority for the proposition that,
if the crews of such vessels, or the members of such military
force, actually desert and scatter themselves throughthe country,
their officers are, in the absence of treaty stipulation, authorized to call upon the local authorities for their reclamation.
While we have no doubt that, under the case above cited, the
foreign officer may exercise his accustomed authority for the
maintenance of discipline, and perhaps arrest a deserter dum
fervet opus, and to that extent this country wdives its jurisdiction over the foreign crew or command, yet if a member of
that crew actually escapes from the custody of his officers, he

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

commits no crime against the local government, and it is a
grave question whether the local courts can be called upon to
enforce what is in reality the law of a foreign sovereign. The
principle of comity may imply the surrender of jurisdiction
over a foreign force within our territory, but it does not necessarily imply the assumption by our courts of a new jurisdiction, invoked by a foreign power, for the arrest of persons who
have committed no offence against our laws, and are perhaps
seeking to become citizens of our country. Our attention has
been called to no such case. But, however this may be, there
can be no doubt that the commissioner, in exercising the powers
vested in him by Rev. Stat. sec. 2580, is limited to the arrest of
seamen belonging to a country with whom we have a treaty
upon that subject.
Instances are by no means rare where foreign troops have
been permitted to enter or cross our territory, although in September, 1790, General Washington, on the advice of Mr. Adams,
did refuse to permit British troops to march through the territory of the United States from Detroit to the Mississippi, apparently for the reason that the object of such movement was
an attack on New Orleans and the Spanish possessions on the
Mississippi. The Government might well refuse the passage of
foreign troops for the purpose of making an attack upon a
power with which we were at peace.
In January, 1862, the Secretary of State gave permission to
the British government to land a body of troops at Portland,
and to transport them to Canada, the St. Lawrence being closed
at that season of the year. The concession was the more significant from the fact that it occurred during our civil war,
when our relations with Great Britain were considerably
strained, and the object was evidently to strengthen the British
garrisons in Canada.
In 1875, permission was granted to the Governor General of
Canada to transport through the territory of the United States
certain supplies for the use of the Canadian mounted police
force.
In 1876, the President permitted Mexico to land in Texas a
small body of her troops, supposed to be intended to aid in the

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
Opinion of the Court.

defence of Matamoras, with the proviso that the stay be not
unnecessarily long, and that the Mexican government shouldbe
liable for any injury inflicted by these troops.
By a reciprocity of courtesy, permission was given in 1881 by
the Governor General of Canada for the passage of a company
of Buffalo militia, armed and equipped, over the Canada Southern Railway, from Buffalo to Detroit. These and other instances are collected by Dr. Wharton in his Digest of International Law, section 13.
Our attention is also called by counsel to the following instances:
At the Columbian celebration in 1893 marines from every
foreign war vessel, except the Spanish, were allowed to land
and did land and parade in the public streets of New York under the control of their various commanders.
On the occasion of the Dewey parade, a regiment of Canadian troops was given permission to come into the United States
and join in the procession.
This permission was granted as in the present case by the
Secretary of the Treasury.
At the Buffalo Exposition, but recently closed, Mexican troops
were allowed to go through the United States and be present
at Buffalo, and remain there during the exposition.
In none of these cases, however, did a question arise with respect to the immunity of foreign troops from the territorial
jurisdiction, or the power of their officers over them, or theright
of the latter to call upon the local officers for the arrest of deserters. While no act of Congress authorizes the executive
department to permit the introduction of foreign troops, the
power to give such permission without legislative assent was
probably assumed to exist from the authority of the President
as commander-in-chief of the military and naval forces of the
United States. It may be doubted, however, whether such
power could be extended to the apprehension of deserters in the
absence of positive legislation to that effect.
If the arrest of Alexandroff were wholly without authority
of law, we should not feel it our duty to detain him and deliver
him up to the custody of Captain Behr, notwithstanding we

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

might be of opinion that he had unlawfully escaped from his
custody. If Captain Behr by the escape of Alexandroff lost
the right to call upon the local authorities for his arrest and
surrender, he acquired no new right in that particular by the
fact that he was illegally arrested and is still in custody. His
detention upon the ground of comity could only be justified by
the fact that his original arrest was legal, although if his arrest
were authorized by law, the fact that such arrest was irregular
might be condoned.
But whatever view might be taken of the question of delivering over foreign seamen in the absence of a treaty, we are of
opinion that the treaty with Russia, having contained a convention upon this subject, that convention must alone be looked
to in determining the rights of the Russian authorities to the
reclamation of the relator. Where the signatory powers have
themselves fixed the terms upon which deserting seamen shall
be surrendered, we have no right to enlarge those powers upon
the principles of comity so as to embrace cases not contemplated
by the treaty. Upon general principles applicable to the construction of written instruments, the enumeration of certain
powers with respect to a particular subject matter is a negation
of all other analogous powers with respect to the same subject
matter. Ex parte -McCardle,7 Wall. 506; Endlich on Stats.
secs. 397, 400. As observed by Lord Denham in Aspdin v.
Austin, 5 Ad. & El. (N. S.) 671, 684," where parties have entered
into written engagements with express stipulations, it is manifestly not desirable to extend them by any implications; the
presumption is that, having expressed some, they have expressed
all the conditions by which they intend to be bound under that
instrument." The rule is curtly stated in the familiar legal
maxim, expressio unius est exclusio alterius. In several recent
cases in this court we have held that, where a statute gives a
certain remedy for usurious interest paid, that remedy is exclusive, although in the absence of such a remedy the defence
might be made by way of set off or credit upon the original
demand. Barnet v. _National Bank, 98 U. S. 555; Driesback

Horton, 5 Ibid. 715; Stafford v. IngersoZl, 3 Hill, 38.
We think, then, that the rights of the parties must be determined by the treaty, but that this particular convention being
operative upon both powers and intended for their mutual protection, should be interpreted in a spirit of uberrimaftdes, and
in a manner to carry out its manifest purpose. Taylor on International Law, sec. 383. As treaties are solemn engagements
entered into between independent nations for the common advancement of their interests and the interests of civilization, and
as their main object is not only to avoid war and secure a lasting and perpetual peace, but to promote a friendly feeling between the people of the two countries, they should be interpreted
in that broad and liberal spirit which is calculated to make for
the existence of a perpetual amity, so far as it can be done without the sacrifice of individual rights or those principles of personal liberty which lie at the foundation of our jurisprudence.
Itis said by Chancellor Kent in his Commentaries (vol. 1, p. 174):
"Treaties of every kind are to receive a fair and liberal interpretation according to the intention of the contracting parties,
and are to be kept with the most scrupulous good faith. Their
meaning is to be ascertained by the same rules of construction
and course of reasoning which we apply to the interpretation
of private contracts."
What, then, are the stipulations to which we must look for
the solution of the question involved in this case? They are
found in the ninth article of the treaty, which authorizes the
arrest and surrender of "deserters from the ships of war and
merchant vessels of their country." It is insisted, however,
that this article is no proper foundation for the arrest of Alexandroff for three reasons : First, that the Variag was not a Russian ship of war; second, that Alexandroff was not a deserter
from such ship; and, third, that his membership of such crew
was not proven by the exhibition of registers of vessels, the rolls
of the crew, or by other official documents. The case depends
upon the answers to these. questions.

of the word under the treaty, she was not then a ship in the
ordinary sense of the term, but shortly thereafter and long before Alexandroff deserted, she was launched, and thereby became a ship in its legal sense. A ship is born when she is
launched, and lives so long as her identity is preserved. Prior
to her launching she is a mere congeries of wood and iron-an
ordinary piece of personal property-as distinctly a land structure as a house, and subject only to mechanics' liens created by
state law and enforcible in the state courts. In the baptism of
launching she receives her name, and from the moment her
keel touches the water she is transformed, and becomes a subject of admiralty jurisdiction. She acquires a personality of
her own; becomes comtletent to contract, and is individually
liable for her obligations, upon which she may sue in the name
of her owner, and be sued in her own name. Her owner's

owner's agents. The China, 7 Wall. 53; Thorp v. Iyammond,

responsible in damages therefor. She may also becomeaquasi
bankrupt; may be sold for the payment of her debts, and thereby
receive a complete discharge from all prior liens, with liberty
to begin a new life, contract further obligations, and perhaps
be subjected to a second sale. We have had frequent occasion
to notice the distinction between a vessel before and after she
is launched. In The Jefferson, People's Ferry Company v.
Beers, 20 How. 393, it was held that the admiralty jurisdiction
did not extend to cases where a lien was claimed for work done
and materials used in the construction of a vessel; while the
cases holding that for repairs or alterations, supplies or materials, furnished after she is launched, suit may be brought in a
court of admiralty, are too numerous for citation.
So sharply is the line drawn between a vessel upon the stocks
and a vessel in the water, that the former can never be made
liable in admiralty, either in 'em against herself or in personam
against her owners, upon contracts or for torts, while if, in taking

the water during the process of launching, she escapes from the
control of those about her, shoots across the stream and injures
another vessel, she is liable to a suit in rem for damages.

Inasmuch as the Variag had been launcled and was lying
in the stream at the time of Alexandroff's desertion, we think
she was a ship within the meaning of the treaty.
It requires no argument to show that if she were a ship of
any description, she was a ship of war as distinguished from a
merchant vessel. Article IX of the treaty embraces deserters
from both classes of vessels. She was clearly not a merchant
vessel, and as clearly intended to be and was a ship of war,
notwithstanding she had not received her armament. The
contract with the Cramps under which she was built was entered into by the Russian Ministry of Marine, and provided
for the construction by them for the Russian Imperial Government of "a protected cruiser, built, equipped, armed and
fitted," etc. The appearance of a modern ship of war, too, is so
wholly distinct from that of a merchant vessel, that there
could be no possibility of mistaking one for the other.
We are also of opinion that she was a Russian ship of war
within the meaning of the treaty. The contract under which
she was built not only provided that she was to be built for
the Imperial Russian Government, but should be constantly,
during the continuance of the contract, inspected by a board
of inspection appointed by the Russian Ministry of Marine,
who should have full liberty to enter the premises of the contractors for such purpose; and that speed trials should be
made by the contractors in the presence of such board of
inspection. The tenth article of the contract reads as follows:
"Art. 10. The contractors agree, that the vessel to be built,
as aforesaid, whether finished or unfinished, tnd all steel, iron,
timber and other materials as may be required by the contractors, and be intended for the construction of the said ship, and

Opinion of the Court.

which may be brought upon the premises of the contractors,
shall immediately thereupon become, and be, the exclusive
property of the Russian Ministry of Marine. The flag of the
Imperial Russian Government shall be hoisted on the said ship,
whenever desired by the board of inspection, as evidence that
the same is said government's exclusive property, and the Russian Ministry of Marine may at any time appoint an officer or
officers to take actual possession of the said ship or materials,
whether finished or unfinished, subject to the lien of the contractors for any portion of the value that may be unpaid."
Such being her status with respect to her title and employment, can it be doubted that, if the contractors had seen fit to
institute proceedings under the mechanics' lien law of the State
for labor and materials furnished in her construction, or if a
materialman had filed a libel in admiralty against her for coal
furnished in testing her engines, or if upon her trial trip she
had negligently come into collision with another vessel whose
owner had instituted a suit against her, the Emperor of Russia
might have claimed for her an immunity from local jurisdiction upon the ground that she was the property of a foreign
sovereign? In making this defence it would necessarily appear
that she was a public vessel; in other words, a ship of war, and
upon that ground immune from suit or prosecution in the local
courts. In the case of The Constitution, 4 P. D. 39, an historical and venerable frigate of the United States, while returning
home from the Paris Exposition with a cargo of American exhibits belonging to private parties, was stranded on the south
coast of England and received salvage services from an English
tug. It was held by the English Court of Admiralty that no
warrant for her arrest could issue, either in respect of ship or
cargo. In The Parlement Belge, 4 P. D. 129, a vessel belonging to the King of the Belgians, manned by officers and men
commissioned and paid by him, and regularly employed for the
purposes of carrying mails, passengers and cargo, was held by
the British Court of Admiralty not to be entitled to the privileges of a man-of-Avar as to extraterritoriality, and that she was
liable to proceedings in rem at the suit of the owner of a vessel injured by her in collision. The decision, however, was re-

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
Opinion of the Court.

versed by the Court of Appeals, upon the ground that the
exercise of such jurisdiction was incompatible with the absolute
independence of the sovereign of every superior authority, and
that the property as well as the person of the sovereign was
exempt from suit. This general question is too well settled to
admit of doubt.
It is true there was a provision that the Variag might be rejected either for deficient speed or for excessive draft, and that
she should be during her construction at the risk of the contractors, until she had been actually accepted by the Imperial Russian Government, or they had taken actual possession of
her. This, however, did not prevent the property passing to
the Russian Government as stipulated by article X of the contract, though with a provision for an ultimate rescission. True,
the Russian flag had never been hoisted upon the vessel, but
that was immaterial, as the government had not finally accepted
or taken possession of her.
Mr. Hall, in his treatise upon International Law, discussing
foreign ships as non-territorial property of a State, (section 44,)
says that the commission under which a commander acts is
conclusive of the public character of a vessel, although such
character is usually evidenced by the flag and pendant which she
carries, and, if necessary, by firing a gun. "When in the absence
of, or notwithstanding, these proofs any doubt is entertained
as to the legitimateness of her claim, the statement of the commander on his word of honor that the vessel is public is often
accepted, but the admission of such statements as proof is a
matter of courtesy," and "though attestation by a government
that a ship belongs to it is final, it does not follow that denial
of public character is equally final; assumption and repudiation of responsibility stand upon a different footing." It is
true he says that the immunities of a vessel of war belong to
her as a complete instrument, made up of vessel and crew, and
intended to be used by the state for specific purposes; the elements of which she is composed not being capable of separate
use for these purposes, and consequently are not exempted from
the local jurisdiction. But it is pertinent to notice here that
he is speaking of immunities of public vessels from local juris-

Opinion of the Court.

diction, and not of the property of a foreign government in
such vessels. See also Taylor on International Law, sees. 253,
254:, 261. There can be no doubt that the Variag, in the condition in which she was at the time Alexandroff deserted, was
a subject of local jurisdiction, and that if any crime had been
committed on board of her, such crime would have been cognizable in the local courts, although it would have been otherwise had the Russian government taken possession, put a crew
on board of her, and commissioned her for active service. This,
however, does not touch the question whether she was not a
ship of war within the letter and spirit of the treaty of 1832.
2. Was Alexandroff a deserter from a Russian ship of war
within the meaning of the treaty, or was he merely a deserter
from the Russian naval service, a fact which of itself would not
be sufficient to authorize his arrest under article IX of the treaty ?
To be a deserter from a particular ship he must have been a
member of the crew of such ship, and bound to remain in its
service until discharged. It is earnestly insisted that, although
he had been detailed to serve thereafter as a member of the
crew of the Variag, her crew had never been organized as such,
that the detail was merely preliminary to such organization,
and that Alexandroff had never set foot upon the vessel. This
argument necessarily presupposes that seamen do not become
a " crew "y until they have actually gone on board the vessel,
and entered upon the performance of their duties. We cannot
acquiesce in this position. The more reasonable view is that
seamen become obligated to merchant vessels from the time
they sign the shipping articles, and from that time they may
incur the penalties of desertion.
So early as the marine ordinances of Louis XIV-the foundation of all maritime codes-the service of the seaman was treated
as beginning from the moment when the contract for such service was entered into. By title three, article III, of this ordinance, "if a seaman leaves a master, without a discharge in
writing, before the voyage is begun, he may be taken up and
imprisoned wherever he can be found," etc. The present Commercial Code of France makes no express provision upon the
subject, but by the general mercantile law of Germany, art. 532,

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
Opinion of the Court.

"The master can cause any seaman, who, after having been engaged, neglects to enter upon or continues to do his duties, to
be forcibly compelled to perform the same." By the Dutch
code, art. 402, "The master, or his representative, can call in
the public force against those who refuse to come on board, who
absent themselves from the ship without leave, and refuse to
to the end of the service for which they were engaged."
perform
The rule
is the same in England. By section 243 of the
Merchants' Shipping Act of 1854, (17 & 18 Vic. chap. 104,)
whenever any seaman, who has been lawfully engaged, or any
apprentice to the sea service, commits any of the following offences, he shall be liable to be punished summarily, as follows,
(that is to say): 2. For neglecting or refusing, without reasonable cause, to join his ship, or to proceed to sea in his ship, or
for absence without leave at any time within twenty-four hours
of the ship's sailing from any port, either at the commencement
or during the progress of any voyage,

he shall be liable

to imprisonment," etc. And by section 246, "Whenever, either
at the commencement or during the progress of any voyage,
any seaman or apprentice neglects or refuses to join, or deserts
from or refuses to proceed to sea in any ship in which he is
duly engaged to serve, the master may call upon the local police officers or constables to apprehend-him." These provisions
have been substantially carried into the new Merchants' Shipping Act. 57 & 58 Vic. chap. 60, see. 221.
Congress, however, has so often spoken upon this subject that
we think it can hardly be open to doubt. By Rev. Stat. sec. 4522,
as amended in 1898, (30 Stat. 755,) regulating seamen engaged
in interstate commerce, there is a provision that "at the foot
of every such contract to ship upon such a vessel

shall be a memorandum in writing of the day and the hour
when such seaman who shipped and subscribed shall render
himself on board to begin the voyage agreed upon. If any seaman shall neglect to renderhimself on boardthe vessel for which
he has shipped at the time mentioned in such memorandum,"
and if the master shall make a proper entry in the log book,
"then every such seaman shall forfeit for every hour which he
shall so neglect to render himself one half of one day's pay."

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

The rights of the seaman in this connection are protected by
section 4527, which declares that "any seaman who has signed
an agreement and who is afterwards dischargedbefore die commencement oftle.voyage or before one month's wages are earned,"
shall be entitled to compensation. By section 4558, as amended,
(30 Stat. 757,) if, after judgment, that such vessel is fit to prothe seamen, or either
ceed on her intended voyage, . .
of them, shall refuse to proceed on the voyage, he shall forfeit
any wages that may be due him. Section 4596 is largely a reproduction of the section above cited from the Mlerchants' Shipping Act, and provides that "whenever any seaman who has
commits any of the following
been lawfully engaged .
offences he shall be punishable as follows: Second. For neglecting or ref using, without reasonable cause, to join his vessel or
to proceed to sea in his vessel, or for absence without leave at
any time within twenty-four hours of the vessel's sailing from
any port, either at the commencement or during the progress
of any voyage," he shall forfeit his wages. By section 4599,
"whenever, either at the commencement of or during any voyage any seaman or apprentice neglects or refuses to join, or deserts from or refuses to proceed to sea in, any vessel in which
he is duly engaged to serve," the master may [in accordance
with the English practice] apply for the local assistance of police
officers or constables for his arrest and detention. It is true
this section has been repealed, together with all other provisions authorizing the arrest and surrender to the vessel of seamen of domestic vessels deserting in this country. But throughout all this legislation there is a recognition of the principle
that the obligation of the seaman begins with the signing of
the shipping articles, and that he is liable to the penalty of a
forfeiture of his wages from that moment.
Upon these authorities we are of opinion that, as applied to
merchant vessels, the crews are organized and the service of
each sailor begins with the signing of the shipping articles, and
that the lien of the seaman upon the ship for his wages, and
reciprocally the lien of the ship upon the seaman for his services, where such lien still exists, dates from that time. The
difficulty of securing a crew would be greatly enhanced if, after

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
Opinion of the Court.

signing the articles and perhaps drawing advance pay, seamen
were at liberty to desert before rendering themselves on board.
The Yariag being a ship of war, there was no signing of shipping articles, as required in the merchant service, since the seamen were enlisted or conscribed to serve where ordered. But
there was a practical equivalent for the shipping articles in the
detail of Alexandroff to this vessel. He entered the Russian
naval service in 1896, and his term of service had not expired.
He was, of course, subject to the orders of his officers, and was
sent as a member of a force of one officer and fifty-three men
ordered to take possession of the Yariag as soon as she was
completed. From the moment of such assignment and until
relieved therefrom, he was as much bound to the service of the
Variag, and a member of her crew, as if he had signed shipping
articles. We express no opinion as to whether, if the rariag
had not been launched when he deserted, he could be held as a
member of her crew, but when she took the water and became
a ship she was competent to receive a crew, and a detail to her
service took effect. It will scarcely be disputed that, if the
Variag had been in commission and this body of men had gone
on board the vessel and rendered some slight service as seamen,
and had subsequently gone ashore to remain until she was ready
for her final departure from Philadelphia, they would be regarded as a component part of her crew; but this differs in
form rather than in substance from what actually took place.
The men were in Philadelphia in custody of Captain Behr, and
ready to go on board at a moment's notice. They were as
much subject to his orders as if they had remained on board
the Variag; and as much so as if she had been a regularly
commissioned vessel of the Russian N~avy, which had put into
Philadelphia for repairs and sent her crew ashore as the most
convenient method of disposing of them while such repairs
were being made.
We do not regard it as material that the Variag had not yet
been commissioned as a member of the Russian Navy. The
mere commissioning of a ship does not make her a ship of war,
but merely indicates that she is assigned to active service. A
merchant vessel, built for the purpose of trade and commerce,

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

is a merchant vessel, though she may not yet have received her
register-a formality only necessary to entitle her to the privileges of an American vessel. To hold that the treaty applies
only to commissioned vessels of war is to introduce into it a
new element and to rob it of a valuable feature. Under the
contract with the builders she was clearly Russian property,
and while ownership is not always proof of nationality, since a
vessel may be owned in one country and registered in another,
where the facts are undisputed, and there was no pretence she
was an American vessel, her Russian nationality follows as a
matter of course. If she went out of commission and her armament were taken out of her for a temporary purpose, she would
nevertheless be a ship of war of the Russian Navy. Being, as
we have already held, a ship, she must be either a ship of war
or merchant vessel, and as she was clearly not a merchant vessel, the only other alternative applies. The treaty should be
liberally interpreted in this particular to carry out the intent
of the parties, since if a foreign government may not send details of men to take possession of vessels built here, without
danger of losing their entire command by desertion, we must
either cease building them or foreign governments must send
special ships of their own with crews ordered to take possession
of them. It is true that possession of the Variag had not yet
been delivered, but the title had passed, and the very fact that
the Russian Government had detailed a crew to take possession
of her indicated that it regarded her as a constituent part of
the Russian Navy. It is unnecessary to consider whether, if
the Variag had been rejected, her crew would have been eo instanti at liberty to leave the Russian service and acquire a citizenship here. That probably would have involved the other
question, whether they could be treated as a military force entering this country with the permission of the Executive and
remaining subject to the orders of their officers.
Holding, as we do, that the rights of the parties must be determined by the treaty, the manner in which this body of men
entered the country does not seem to be material, so long as it
appears that they were detailed as part of the crew of the
Variag. If they were not here as a military force, which had

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
Opinion of the Court.

landed with the permission of the government, they were lawfully here as individual seamen directed to take possession of
the Yariag, and the purpose of their coming was of no moment
to the authorities. It appears, however-and it is not improper
to allude to it here-that, as the Variag approached her completion, the naval agent of the Russian Embassy to the United
States addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury, requesting that the necessary orders be given for allowing "admittance to the United States, through the port of New York,
without examination, the detail of one officer and fifty-three
regular sailors, Imperial Russian Navy, detailed to this country
for the purpose of partly manning the cruiser," etc. In reply,
the Acting Secretary of the Treasury issued instructions to the
Commission of Immigration to admit the detail without examination for the purposes named, and to remit the usual head
tax of one dollar.
3. The only remaining question is whether there was a compliance with article IX of the treaty, that the vice-consul "shall
in writing demand said deserters, proving, by the exhibition of
the registers of the vessels, the rolls of the crews, or by any
other official documents, that such individuals foiwmed part of
the crews; and this reclamation being thus substantiated, the
surrender shall not be refused." We have no doubt this provision is obligatory, and that the vice-consul must show either
that it was complied with or that a compliance was waived.
We are not informed by the record what evidence was laid
before the commissioner upon this subject. Alexandroff himself,
however, swears that he entered the naval service in 1896 as
an assistant physician; that he arrived in the United States
October 14, 1899; that he never asked to become a member of
the crew, but was simply sent to the United States and lived
with the crew of the Russian ship, received his equipment, support and wages; that he left the crew on April 20, 1900, went
to New York, declared his intention to become a citizen, and
obtained employment. On cross examination he stated that a
subject is not required to sign any enlistment or anything of
that kind, but is simply sent into the service. After the oral

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

testimony had been introduced, the Russian vice-consul, to further sustain his case, made the following offer:
"Mr. Adler: I also have here the Russian officer who accompanied these fifty-three sailors to this country, together with
the other members of the crew, who has with him the passport
issued by his government entitled these men to come here. I
understand it is admitted by the other side that this defendant
did come here as a portion of the crew of this cruiser, and the
passport so states. If that is admitted, I presume it is not necessary to offer the passport in evidence. If your honor cares to
have it, I will produce this officer with the passport and offer
it. It merely shows that this defendant, with fifty-two other
members of a company in the Russian Navy, were admitted to
free passage here to become members of the crew of the cruiser
Variag, and that he came here in pursuance of that passport
accompanied by this officer.
"Mr. Hassler: I should object to the officer, not so much on
account of what is in the passport, but my friend made a statement which I do not think is exactly accurate, as to what we
stated. We stated this man came here with a company of men,
but we do n6t state that he came here as part of the crew of
the Variag.
"The Court: He came here as a member of the Russian
Navy, ordered here to become one of the crew of the cruiser
Variag, and he came for that express purpose.
"Mr. Hassler: We concede that."
There was here a clear waiver of the production of the passport and an admission that Alexandroff came to this country
as a member of the Russian Navy, was ordered here to become
one of the crew of the Variag, and came for that express purpose. Under such circumstances, it does not lie in the mouth
of the relator to insist that no official documents were produced,
since the passport and the admission accompanying its offer
show that Alexandroff came here as a member of the proposed
crew of the Variag, (and we have discussed the case upon that
assumption)-the question being whether under those circumstances he ought to be treated as a deserter from a Russian
ship of war.

thought that the men, among whom was the respondent, came
into the country with the expressed permission of the Executive
as a part of the Russian Navy and as members of the crew of
the steamship awaiting completion as a man-of-war; and the
Russian government was, therefore, upon the principle of comity,

accomplish the arrest and detention of a deserter from the ranks
of those men it had thus expressly authorized to come in.

it shall be the duty of any court, judge, commissioner of any

However, if the deserter should be found to have committed
any crime or offence, his surrender may be delayed until the
tribunal before which his case shall be depending shall have
pronounced its sentence, and such sentence shall have been carried into effect." 8 Stat. 448.
The warrant of commitment in this case was issued by the
commissioner on June 1, 1900, on the application of the ViceConsul of Russia at Philadelphia, upon the affidavit of Captain
Vladimir Behr, stating that he was master of the Russian cruiser
Variag, then in the port of Philadelphia, and that Alexandroff was a duly engaged seaman of that vessel, and on or before April 25,1900, had desertedfrom her without anyintention
of returning.
The Variag was built under a contract in writing, dated
April 23, 1898, between the William Cramp and Sons Ship and
Engine Building Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and
the Russian Ministry of Marine, by which the Cramp Company
agreed to supply. for the Imperial Russian Navy a protected
crusier, built, equipped, armed and fitted, (except the ordnance
and torpedo outfit,) subject to the approval of a board of inspectors appointed by the Russian Ministry of Marine. That contract contained the following provisions:
"ART. 8. Trials to determine the speed of the vessel shall be
made by the contractors, in the presence of the board of inspection, and at the cost of the contractors, who agree to insure
the vessel against sea risks and all other risks of every description during the trials, and until such time as the vessel is handed
over to the exclusive possession and custody of the Russian
Ministry of Marine." And if the mean speed should be less

than twenty-one knots per hour, or the actual draught of water
in any part of the ship should exceed the contract draught by
one foot, it should be optional with the Russian Ministry of
Marine to reject the ship.
"ART. 10. The contractors agree that the vessel to be built
as aforesaid, whether finished or unfinished, and all steel, iron,
timber and other materials as may be required by the contractors, and be intended for the construction of the said ship, and
which may be brought upon the premises of the contractors,
shall immediately thereupon become and be the exclusive property of the Russian Ministry of Marine. The flag of the Imperial Russian Government shall be hoisted on the said ship,
whenever desired by the board of inspection, as evidence that
the same is said government's exclusive property, and the Russian Ministry of Marine may at any time appoint an officer or
officers to take actual possession of the said ship or material,

be, from time to time, sufficient to cover and recoup to the Imperial Russian Government the sum or sums which said government, for the time being, may have paid, or become bound to
pay, to the contractors in respect of such vessel." "INotwithstanding anything herein contained, the ship, together with its
engines, machinery and equipment, shall, as between the contractors and the Russian Ministry of Marine, stand, and at all
times be, at the risk of the contractors, until the said ship has
been accepted by the Imperial Russian Government, or it has
taken actual possession thereof."
"ART. 13. The contractors engage, at their own cost and
risk, to launch and deliver the vessel safe and uninjured at
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and equipped for sea, into the
charge of the persons appointed by the Imperial Russian Gov-

ernment to receive it, in not more than twenty months after
the arrival of the board of inspectors at Philadelphia."
By article 18, the Russian Ministry of Marine agreed to pay
the price in ten equal instalments, withholding ten per cent of
each instalment until final payment. The instalments were
payable at successive periods, the last two being as follows:
"9. Ten per cent when steam has been raised in the boilers and
the engines turned over under their own steam. 10. Ten per
cent when the ship has had a successful trial trip and has been
turned over to the Imperial Russian Government, and simultaneously therewith there shall be paid to the contractors the
ten per cent of each of the previous instalments which shall have
been withheld as aforesaid."
Alexandroff entered the Russian Navy in 1896, at the age of
seventeen, for the term of six years, and was an assistant physician. He was one of fifty-three members of the Russian Navy,
sent out in a passenger steamship (not a Russian) by the Russian
Government, under command of an officer, for the purpose of
becoming part of the crew of the cruiser Variag ; and arrived
in this country October 14, 1899. The ship was then on the
stocks, and was launched in October or November, 1899, and
made one trial trip. But in June, 1900, she was still in the custody of the contractors, had not been completed by them, or
accepted by the Russian government, and a good many of the
contractors' men were still working on her; and only about
eighty per cent of her price had been paid. Alexandroff was
never on the ship, never signed any paper as a member of her
crew, and was never ordered on board of her, either as a seaman
or as an assistant physician; but from October, 1899, to April,
1900, lived on shore, with the rest of the men who came with
him, had his photograph taken with them, received equipment,
support and wages from the Russian Government, and performed
the duties required of him as an assistant physician. He left
his associates, without leave, at Philadelphia on April 20,1900,
went to New York, and there took up his residence, and on
May 24, 1900, made in court a primary declaration of his intention to become a citizen of the United States.
There was introduced in evidence, without objection, a copy

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
GRAY, J., FULLER, C. J., HARLAN and W=rE, JJ., dissenting.

of a letter, (the original of which was said to be in the possession of the Russian Ambassador at Washington,) dated "Treasury Department, Office of the Secretary, Washington, D. C.,
October 4, 1899," signed by the Acting Secretary of the Treasury, and in these terms:
"Sir: Acknowledging the receipt of your letter of 24th ultimo,
No. 557, I have the honor to inform you that, in compliance
with request contained therein, instructions have been issued to
the commissioner of immigration at the port of New York, to
admit without examination the detail of one officer and fiftythree regular sailors whom you state have been detailed to this
country for the purpose of partially manning the cruiser now
under construction for theRussian Government at Cramp's ship
yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The collector of customs
has also been advised that the usual head tax of $1.00 is not to
be collected in this case."
This letter was assumed by the courts below to have been
addressed to the Russian Ambassador and in answer to a letter
from him. But it appears by copies of documents in the Treasury Department, submitted by counsel for the petitioner by
leave of this court, that it was in answer to a letter, dated
September 24, 1899, No. 557, from the Naval Attach6 of the
Imperial Russian Embassy at Washington to the Secretary of
the Treasury, requesting that the necessary orders to whom it
concerned might be given for "allowing admittance to the
United States through the port of New York without examination the detail of one officer and fifty-three regular sailors,
Imperial Russian Navy, detailed to this country for the purpose
of partially manning the cruiser now under construction for the
Russian Government at Cramp's ship yard, in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania."
That correspondence also included similar letters between
the Naval Attach6 of the Russian Embassy and the Secretary
of the Treasury of June 22 and 23, 1899, concerning "a detail
of one officer and twenty-nine regular sailors for the purpose of
partially manning the crusier" aforesaid.
Together with that correspondence, the petitioner submitted
to this court copies of papers from the Department of State
showing the following:

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
GRAY, J., FULLEB, C. J., HARLAN and WHITE,

JJ., dissenting.

On December 6, 1900, the Russian Ambassador wrote to the
Secretary of State, saying that the Russian Minister of the
Navy had just informed him that 224 sailors of the Russian
Imperial Navy, accompanied by three officers, one doctor and
a commissary, had embarked at London on the Rhineland for
Philadelphia, and that "211 of them have been sent to complete the crew of the Russian crusier Variag, and the other 13
are under orders for the Retvisan, which is being built by the
Cramps of Philadelphia," and requesting the Secretary of State
"to notify the Treasury Department of the approaching arrival
of these sailors, and to request that they may be allowed to
land, and that restitution may be made to the superior officer
of the tax imposed on emigrants and paid at the time of their
embarkation." On December 15, 1900, the Secretary of State
answered that the request had been referred to the Secretary
of the Treasury, who had replied that the commissioner of immigration at Philadelphia had been directed to facilitate the
landing of the seamen and officers referred to, and the collector
of customs to refrain from collecting theper capita tax from
the steamship company; and that said company should be
called upon to refund the amount paid to their Liverpool representative in advance for the head tax. On December 25 and
28, 1900, a like correspondence took place between the Russian
Ambassador and the Secretary of State concerning "213 seamen of the Imperial fleet, accompanied by two officers, a monk
and a cook," embarked at Liverpool for Philadelphia on the
Belgenland, and "sent hither to complete the crew of the Imperial cruiser Variag."
In the Circuit Court of Appeals, on October 1, 1900, the Attorney of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, "at the instance of the Executive Department of the
Government of the United States," filed by leave of court a
suggestion, stating the facts as appearing by the record, and
praying that Alexandroff be remanded to the custody of the
keeper of the county prison at Philadelphia, to await the order
of Captain Vladimir Behr, master of the cruiser Variag.
Such being the facts of the case, we proceed to state the
principles by which it appears to us to be governed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
GRAY, J., FuLLER, C. J., HARLAN and WHITE, JJ., dissenting.

The jurisdiction of every nation within its own territory is
absolute and exclusive; by its own consent only can any exception to that jurisdiction exist in favor of a foreign nation; and
any authority in its own courts to give effect to such an exception by affirmative action must rest upon express treaty or
statute.
In the case of The Exchange, decided by this court in 1812,
nearly ninety years ago, the point adjudged was that "The
Exchange, being a public armed ship, in the service of a foreign
sovereign, with whom the government of the United States is at
peace, and having entered an American port open for her reception, on the terms on which ships of war are generally permitted
to enter the ports of a friendly power, must be considered as
having come into the American territory under an implied
promise that while necessarily within it, and demeaning herself
in a friendly manner, she should be exempt from the jurisdiction of the country." 7 Cranch, 116, 147. Chief Justice Marshall, in expounding at large the principles upon which the exemption was founded, began by saying: "The jurisdiction of
courts is a branch of that which is possessed by the nation as an
independent sovereign power. The jurisdiction of the nation
within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute.
It is susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself. Any
restriction upon it, deriving validity from an external source,
would imply a diminution of its sovereignty to the extent of the
restriction, and an investment of that sovereignty to the same
extent in that power which could impose such restriction. All
exceptions, therefore, to the full and complete power of a nation
within its own territories, must be traced up to the consent
of the nation itself. They can flow from no other legitimate
source. This consent may be either express or implied. In the
latter case, it is less determinate, exposed more to the uncertainties of construction; but, if understood, not less obligatory."
7 Cranch, 136. He then dealt with the principal exceptions:
1st. The exemption from arrest or detention of a foreign sovereign entering the territory of a nation with the license of its
sovereign. 2d. The immunity which all civilized nations allow
to foreign ministers. 3d. The cession of a portion of the ter-

ritorial jurisdiction by allowing the troops of a foreign prince
to pass through the territory.
The opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in the case of The Exchange has ever since been recognized as laying down the principles which govern the subject. His very language has been
embodied by Wheaton in his Elements of International Law,
pt. 2, c. 2; (8th ed.) §§ 96-101. Phillimore, in his Commentaries
on International Law, (3d ed.) 476, 479, says: "Long usage and
universal custom entitle every such ship to be considered as a part
of the State to which she belongs, and to be exempt from any
other jurisdiction." "The privilege is extended, by the reason
of the thing, to boats, tenders and all appurtenances of a ship of
war, but it does not cover offences against the territorial law
committed upon shore." And in 1880, Lord Justice Brett,
(since Lord Esher, M. R.,) delivering the judgment of the English Court of Appeal, dealing with "the reason of the exemption of ships of war and some other ships," said, "The first
case to be considered is, and always will be, T]w Exchange."
The Parlement Belge, 5 Prob. Div. 197, 208.
In the Santissima Tpinidad, Mr. Justice Story, speaking for
this court, said: "In the case of The Exchange, 7 Cranch, 116,
the grounds of the exemption of public ships were fully discussed
and expounded. It was there shown that it was not founded
upon any notion that a foreign sovereign had an absolute
right, in virtue of his sovereignty, to an exemption of his property from the local jurisdiction of another sovereign, when it
came within his territory; for that would be to give him sovereign power beyond the limits of his own empire. But it
stands upon principles of public comity and convenience, and
arises from the presumed consent or license of nations that foreign public ships coming into their ports, and demeaning themselves according to law, and in a friendly manner, shall be
exempt from the local jurisdiction." "It may therefore be
justly laid down as a general proposition, that all persons and
property within the territorial jurisdiction of a sovereign are
amenable to the jurisdiction of himself or his courts ; and that
the exceptions to this rule are such only as by common usage and
public policy have been allowed, in order to preserve the peace

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.

and harmony of nations, and to regulate their intercourse in a
manner best suited to their dignity and rights." I7Wheat. 283,
352-351.
We find no precedent, either in our own decisions, or in the
books of international law, for extending the exemption to an
uncompleted ship, or to sailors who have never been on board
of her, although intended to become part of her crew when she
shall have been completed.
On the contrary, Mr. Hall says that where a ship is bought,
or is built and fitted out to order, she is only private property
until she is commissioned; and, although invested with minor
privileges, such as immunity from liens of mechanics, she is far,
if she be a ship of war, from enjoying the full advantages of a
public character. And again: "The immunities of a vessel of
war belong to her as a complete instrument, made up of vessel
and crew, and intended to be used by the State for specific purposes; the elements of which she is composed are not capable
of separate use for those purposes; they consequently are not
exempted from the local jurisdiction. If a ship of war is abandoned by her crew, she is merely property; if members of her
crew go outside the ship or her tenders or boats, they are liable
in every respect to the territorial jurisdiction." Hall's International Law, (4th ed.) 169, 205. So Mr. T. J. Lawrence says:
"The immunities of which we have been speaking do not follow the members of the ship's company when they land. In
their ship and in its boats, which are appurtenant to it and
share its privileges, they are exempt from the local jurisdiction;
but the moment they set foot on shore they come under the
authority of the State, and may be arrested and tried like other
foreigners if they commit crimes or create disturbances." Principles of International Law, (3d ed.) 229.
In Thie E ehange, as has always been recognized by this
court, it was treated as well settled that a foreign army permitted to march through a friendly country, or to be stationed
in it, by permission of its government, is exempt from the civil
and criminal jurisdiction of the place. Coleman v. Tennessee,
97 U. S.509, 515; Dow v. Johnson, 100 U. S.158, 165. "The
grant of a free passage," said Chief Justice Marshall, "implies

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
GRAY, J., FULLER, 0. J., HARLAN and WHmTE, JJ., dissenting.

a waiver of all jurisdiction over the troops during their passage,
and permits the foreign general to use that discipline, and to
inflict those punishments, which the government of his army
may require." 7 Cranch, 140. That rule, waiving the jurisdiction of the United States over a body of men, and allowing
them to be governed, disciplined and punished by their own
officers, applies only to an armed force, segregated from the
general population of the country, and lawfully passing through
or stopping in the country for some definite purpose connected
with military operations.
This is no such case. This was a squad of men intended, indeed, at some time in the future, to become part of the crew
of a ship of war. But they were not yet part of that crew,
and were, for six months before the desertion, quartered on
shore in the midst of a large city, and were as yet engaged in
performing no military or naval duty, beyond the fact that
Alexandroff attended the others when sick. The suggestion of
the majority of the court that Alexandroff and his associates
were sent out by the Russian Government "to take possession
of the Variag" must be founded on the statement (which is all
that the record contains on the subject) that they were sent
out "for the purpose of becoming part of her crew."
The permission to a foreign nation to pass troops or munitions of war through the United States has been granted by
the Executive Department in a few instances, generally by the
Secretary of State. 1 Wharton's International Law Digest,
§ 13. And there are cases collected by Mr. Cushing, in ' Opinions of Attorneys General, 453, in which the President of the
Ufiited States has for various purposes acted through the Department of the Treasury or some other department within its
appropriate jurisdiction. It is not necessary in this case to consider the full extent of the power of the President in such
matters.
The request of the representative of Russia on September 24,
1899, was simply for the admission into the United States of
"one officer and fifty-three regular sailors Imperial Russian
Navy, detailed to this country for the purpose of partially
manning the cruiser now under construction for the Russian

O0'OBER TERMI, 1901.

WHITE, JJ., dissenting.

Government at Cramp's shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania." And the response of the Secretary of the Treasury, following the terms of the request, stated that instructions had
been given to admit them without examination, and not to collect the head tax of one dollar. The other correspondence submitted to this court, and relied on by the petitioner, shows that
in June, 1899, the Secretary of the Treasury had given like
instructions as to one officer and twenty-nine other sailors; and
that, at the request of the Russian Ambassador, in December, 1900, (fourteen months after the arrival of Alexandroff
and his associates in this country, and eight months after his
desertion,) the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the
Treasury gave precisely similar instructions as to a body of two
hundred and eleven seamen, and as to another body of two
hundred and thirteen seamen, each sent out to complete
the crew of the Variag. It thus appears that Alexandroff and
his associates, with the previous detail of thirty persons, together
constituted less than one sixth of the intended crew of the
Variag.
Moreover, all the letters of the Secretary of the Treasury,
and of the Secretary of State, show nothing more than an admission into the United States without examination, and an
exemption from the head tax, of persons intended to become
part of the crew of the cruiser Variag. These persons, coming
into the United States for a temporary purpose only, were
clearly not immigrants, nor liable to the head tax upon immigrants. A like admission and exemption would apply to any
civilians employed by the Russian Government and coming
here temporarily in its service.
It is impossible, therefore, to imply such a waiver of the
jurisdiction of the United States over them, as in the case of a
foreign army marching through or stationed in the United
States by consent of the Government. And even permission
to march a foreign armed force through the country does not
imply a duty to arrest deserters from that force.
The question in this case is not one of the mere exemption
of Alexandroff from the jurisdiction of the government and
the courts of the United States. The question is whether the

TUCKER v. ALEXANDROFF.
GRAY, J., FULLER, C. J., HARLAN and WHITE, JJ., dissenting.

courts and magistrates of the United States are authorized to
exercise affirmative jurisdiction to enforce the control of the
Russian authorities over him, after he has escaped from their
custody, and to restore him to their control, so that he may be
returned to Russia and be there subjected to such punishment
as the laws of that country impose upon deserters.
Nations do not generally, at the present day, agree to deliver
up to each other deserters from a military force. But it is
usual, in order to prevent the ships of war or the merchant vessels of one country from being rendered unfit for navigation by
the desertion of their seamen in the ports of another country,
to provide by treaty or convention that the authorities of the
latter country, upon the application of a consul of the former,
should afford assistance in the arrest and detention, and the return to their ships, of seamen deserting from a vessel of either
class. 1 Ortolan, Diplomatie de la Mer, (4th ed.) 312, 313; 2

provision was carried into effect by the act of May 4, 1826, c.
36. 4 Stat. 160.
The first general statute on the subject was the act of
March 2, 1829, c. 41, (4 Stat. 359,) which, as amended by the
act of February 24, 1855, (10 Stat. 614,) by allowing United
States commissioners to act in the matter, is embodied in section 5280 of the Revised Statutes, under which the application
in this case was made, and which applies only to "any foreign
government having a treaty with the United States stipulating
for the restoration of seamen deserting."
The Variag, at the time of Alexandroff's desertion, was indeed, in one sense, a ship, because she had been launched and
was waterborne. And, by the terms of the contract under
which she was being built, the legal title in her, as fast as constructed, had vested in the Russian Government, so that, without regard to the question whether she was a ship of war, she
could not have been subjected to private suit in rem in admiralty.
The Prlement Belge, 5 Prob. Div. 197. But she had not been
completed, and was in the custody of the contractors, and their
men were still at work upon her; by the express terms of the
contract, she might still be rejected by the Russian Government, and remained at the risk of the contractors until that
government had accepted her or taken actual possession of her;
and she had not been fully paid for. She was not equipped
for sea, and never had any part of her crew on board, and she
had never been accepted, or taken actual possession of, by the
Russian Government. Alexandroff and his associates were a
squad of men, sent out six months before by the Russian Government for the purpose of becoming part of her crew, and received wages as members of the Russian Navy. But they had
never become part of an organized crew, or done any naval or
military duty, or been on board of her, or been ordered on board
of her; for the whole six months they had lived together on
shore; and no regular ship's roll, or other official document,
was produced showing that they had actually become part of
the crew of the Variag.
The treaty with Russia of 1832 speaks of "deserters from
the ships of war and merchant vessels of their country;" and

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
GRAY, J., FULLER, C. J., HARLAN and WHITE, JJ., dissenting.

section 5280 of the Revised Statutes speaks of persons who have
"deserted from a vessel of any- such government;" each applying only to those who desert from a ship. Both the treaty and
the statute require proof to be made by exhibition of the register of the vessel, ship's roll or other official document, that the
deserter, at the time of his desertion, belonged to, or formed
part of, her crew. And the provision of the treaty for the detention of the deserters until "they shall be restored to the vessels to which they belonged, or sent back to their own country
by a vessel of the same nation or any other vessel whatsoever,"
necessarily implies that they belong to a completed vessel upon
which they could remain from day to day, and the departure
of which may require them to be sent back by another vessel.
The object of both treaty and statute, as of the treaties with other
nations upon the same subject, was not to encourage shipbuilding for foreign nations in the ports of the United States, or to
cover unfinished ships and preparations for manning them when
finished; but it was to secure the continued capacity for navigation of ships already completely built, equipped and manned.
Both treaty and statute look to a complete ship, and to an organized crew; and neither can reasonably be applied to a ship
which has never been completed, or made ready to receive a
crew, or had any roll or list of them, or to men who have never
been on board the ship as part of her crew. Moreover, the
Russian Government, as is admitted, had never accepted or
taken possession of the ship, and, by the terms of the contract
under which she was building, still had the right to reject her.
So long as they had that right, no body of men could be considered as actually part of her crew, whatever they might have
been after her acceptance. The evident intent of the statute,
as of the treaty, is to afford a remedy for the common case of
sailors deserting their ship, on her coming into port, at the risk
of leaving her with no sufficient crew to continue her voyage;
and not to the case of a ship which has never been completed,
or equipped for sea, or to persons collected together on shore
for an indefinite period, doing no naval duty, though intended
ultimately to become part of her crew.
The various treaties of the United States with foreign nations

TUCKER v. ATLEXANDROFF.
GRAY, J., FULLEB, C. J., HALAN and WHiTE, JJ., dissenting.

apply in. a few instances, as in the treaties with Spain of 1819,
and with Great Britain of 1892, to merchant vessels only, but,

for the most part, as in the treaty with Russia, to both ships of
war and merchant vessels. When they apply to both, (except
in the treaties with Peru,) deserters from ships of war are put
upon the same footing with deserters from merchant vessels;
and no greater authority is given to arrest and surrender in the
case of the one than in that of the other. Could it be contended
that the authority should be extended to the case of sailors who
had been collected together on shore for the purpose of becoming, in the future, part of the crew of a merchantman still in
the course of construction, and not yet ready to receive them?
The statutes regulating the contract between the owner of a
merchantman and his sailors do not appear to us to have any
bearing upon the construction and effect of this treaty. Those
statutes relate to seamen who, by their shipping articles, have
agreed to render themselves on board at a certain time, and to
their right to compensation and liability to punishment, or to
forfeiture of wages, after that time. Rev. Stat. §§ 4522, 4524,
4527, 4528, 4558 ; Act of December 21, 1898, c. 28, §§ 2, 9; 30
Stat. 755, '757. And section 4599 of the Revised Statutes (repealed by section 25 of the act of 1898) provided for the arrest
and detention, by police officers, of any seaman, having signed
such articles, who "neglects or refuses to join, or deserts from
or refuses to proceed to sea in" his vessel. The clause "neglects or refuses to join" would have been superfluous if legally

clause.
The treaty, as already stated, requires the fact that the deserter was part of the crew of the vessel to be proved by the
exhibition of the register of the vessel, the roll of the crew, or
other official document. Attorney General Black was of opinion
that an exhibition of the original ship's roll, or a corresponding
document containing the names of the whole crew, was essential,
and could not be supplied by a copy of an extract from the roll,
containing the deserter's name; and said: "It might be convenient, in cases like this, to dispense with the production of
the original document, and let the rights of the person claimed

as a deserter depend on the mere certificate of a consul; but a
written compact between two nations is not to be set aside for
a shade or two of convenience more or less." 9 Opinions of
Attorneys General, 96. However that may be, in this case there
is no pretence that the Variag had, or was in a condition to
have, any roll or list of her crew; and at the hearing it was not
admitted that there was any such roll or list, or that Alexandroff was a member of her crew, but only that he was a member of the Russian Navy, sent out for the purpose of becoming
part of her crew. The treaty cannot be construed as extending
to the case of a ship which has never been completed, or ready
to receive her crew, or had any roll or list of the crew; or to a
small part of the men, ultimately intended to form part of her
crew, who have never been such, nor ever been on board, but
have remained for six months on shore, doing no naval duty.
Moreover, it being quite clear, and indeed hardly denied, that
the Variag, in her existing condition, was not a Russian ship of
war exempt from the jurisdiction of the United States and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of her own country, it would
seem necessarily to follow that she was not a ship of war in the
sense that the authorities of the United States could take affirmative action to enforce the jurisdiction of that country over her
or over the men intended to become part of her crew.
The necessary conclusion is that neither the treaty with Russia of 1832, nor section 5280 of the Revised Statutes, gave any
authority to the United States commissioner to issue the warrant of commitment of Alexandroff.
It was argued, however, at the bar, that, if this case did not
come within the treaty or the statute, the United States were
bound, by the comity of nations, to take active steps for the arrest of Alexandroff, and for his surrender to the Russian authorities. But this position cannot be maintained.
The treaties of the United States with Russia and with most
of the nations of the world must be considered as defining and
limiting the authority of the government of the United States
to take active steps for the arrest and surrender of deserting
seamen.
These treaties must be construed so as to carry out, in the

utmost good faith, the stipulations therein made with foreign
nations. But neither the executive nor the judiciary of the
United States has authority to take affirmative action, beyond
the fair scope of the provisions of the treaty, to subject persons
within the territory of the United States to the jurisdiction of
another nation.
The practice of the Executive Department, from the beginning, shows that such authority does not exist, in the absence
of express treaty or statute. The precedents on the subject are
collected in 1 Moore on Extradition, %§ 408-411, and we have
examined the archives of the Department of State, to which
upon such a subject we are at liberty to refer. Jones v. -nited

In 1802, in the administration of President Jefferson, the
British Oharg6 d'Affaires complained to Mr. Madison, Secretary
of State, of the refusal of the collector of customs at Norfolk in
Virginia to cause a seaman, who had deserted from a British
ship of war, to be surrendered, on an application made by her
captain, through the British consul at that port. Mr. Madison
answered: "It need not be observed to you, Sir, that a delivery
in such cases is not required by the law of nations, and that in
the treaty of 1794 the parties have forborne to extend to such
cases the stipulated right to demand their respective citizens
and subjects. It follows that the effect of applications in such
cases must depend on the local laws existing on each side. It
is not known that those in Great Britain contain any provisions
for the delivery of seamen deserting from American ships. It
is rather presumed that the law would there immediately interpose its defence against a compulsive recovery of deserters. In
some of the individual States the law is probably similar to that
of Great Britain. In others it is understood that the recovery
of seamen deserting from foreign vessels can be effected by legal process." And, after stating that there was no law for
their recovery in Virginia, he concluded: "This view of the
subject necessarily determines that the President cannot interpose the orders which are wished, however sensible he may be
of the beneficial influence which friendly and reciprocal resto-

rations of seamen could not fail to have on the commerce and
confidence which he wishes to see cherished between the two
nations." 14 MSS. Domestic Letters, 89, in Department of
State.
In 1815, in the administration of President Madison, the
British Minister having requested the interposition of the Government of the United States to cause the delivery of seamen
who had deserted from a British ship of war, Mr. Monroe, Secretary of State, answered: "I regret that there is no mode in
which this government can interpose to accomplish the object
you have in view. Neither the laws of the United States nor
the laws of nations have provided for the arrest or detention of
deserters from the vessels of a friendly power. It is hoped,
however, that this is one of the subjects which may hereafter
be satisfactorily arranged by treaty between the two nations."
1 Moore, § 408.
In 1846, in President Polk's administration, the British Minister applied for the surrender of a seaman who had deserted
from a British ship of war, and was serving on a war vessel of
the United States; and Mr. Buchanan, Secretary of State, replied: "Your communication has been submitted to the President; and I am instructed to express his regret that he cannot
comply with your request. The case of deserters from the vessels of war of the respective nations is not embraced by the
tenth article of the treaty of Washington providing for extradition in certain cases; and without a treaty stipulation to this
effect, the President does not possess the power to deliver up
such deserters. The United States have treaties with several
nations which confer upon him this power ; but none such exists
with Great Britain." 7 MSS. Notes to Great Britain, 117, in
Department of State.
In September, 18641, in the administration of President Lincoln, while the United States steamship Iroquois was lying in
the Downs, three of her seamen deserted. They were arrested
on complaint of the United States consular agent, brought before a police magistrate at Dover, and discharged by him, on
the ground that, as they had violated no law of England, there
was no authority for their arrest and detention. Upon the mat-

ter being brought by Mr. Adams, the American Minister, to the
attention of the British Government, Lord Russell replied "that
there is no law in force in this country by which these deserters
could be given up." 1 Moore, § 409 ; Dip. Cor. 1864, pt. 2, 336.
In July, 1864, Lord Lyons, the British Minister, submitted to
Mr. Seward, Secretary of State, a statement that two apprentices, employed on board the British barque Cuzco, had deserted
at Valparaiso and enlisted on a United States ship of war; and
asked for an investigation. On December 4, 1864, Mr. Seward
communicated the results of the investigation to the British
Charg d'Affaires; and informed him that, owing to the action
of the British Government in the case of the deserters from the
Iroquois, the United States did not deem themselves under either
a legal or a moral obligation to deliver up the deserters from
the Cuzco. On February 23, 1865, the British Charg6 d'Affaires,
by instructions from his government, replied that it was unable
to follow the principle or reason of the resolution of the United
States Government, and insisted that "it is in the power of the
naval officers of the United States (as it would be in that of
Her Majesty's naval officers in a like case) to deliver up on the
high seas, or in any foreign port, under the instructions of their
government, deserters from foreign vessels who may without
lawful authority be found on board one of the ships of war of
the United States;" but he distinctly admitted and asserted:
"But when a foreign deserter is on shore in Great Britain, (and
Her Majesty's government presume the case would be the same
in the United States,) the power of Her Majesty's naval officers
and of Her Majesty's government itself over him is at an end; he
can then only be detained or delivered up for some cause authorized by the law of the land." The case was not further
pursued. 1 Moore, § 409, and note.
The earliest treaty between the United States and Great
Britain on the subject is that of June 2, 1892, which applies
only to merchant seamen, being limited to "seamen who may
desert from any ship belonging to a citizen or subject of their
respective countries." 27 Stat. 961.
The first treaty with Denmark on the subject is that of July 11,
1861, concerning "deserters from the ships of war and merchant

vessels of their country." 13 Stat. 606. In 1853, in the administration of President Pierce, on a question of the arrest of a
deserter from a Danish ship and his discharge by the authorities
in New York, (the treaties between the United States and Denmark not then containing any stipulation for the restoration of
deserting seamen,) Mr. Cushing, as Attorney General, gave an
opinion to Mr. Marcy, Secretary of State, that without such a
treaty the executive or judicial authorities of the United States
had no power to arrest, detain and deliver up a Danish mariner
on the demand of the consul or other agents of Denmark, and
said: "The summary arrest and delivery up of deserters from
the service of other nations, like the surrender of fugitives from
their criminal justice, when found in the territory of a country
into which they have escaped or fled, is not a duty absolutely
enjoined by the law of nations, but a subject of special convention. So also are the authority and jurisdiction of consuls and
commercial agents in regard to demanding and superintending
the arrest, detention and surrender, either of deserters from
service or fugitives from justice." 6 Opinions of Attorneys
General, 148, 154.
This uninterrupted course of action of the Executive Department, beginning almost a century ago, must be considered as
conclusively establishing that, independently of a treaty, no international obligation exists to surrender foreign seamen who
have deserted in this country.
It is hardly necessary to add that the suggestion of the District Attorney can have no effect, other than to call the attention of the court to the facts of the record. The question
whether those facts justified the commitment of the prisoner by
the United States commissioner is a question to be decided, not
by the Executive Department or by any of its officers, but by
the courts of justice.
According to our view of the facts, and for the reasons and
upon the authorities above stated, we are of opinion that the
commissioner had no authority to commit the prisoner, that his
imprisonment was unlawful, and that he is entitled to be discharged.
