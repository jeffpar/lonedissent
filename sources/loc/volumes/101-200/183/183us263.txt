CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.
No. 15. Argued January 17,1901.-Decided January 6, 1902.
"The Kensington," a steamer transporting passengers from Antwerp to
New York, took on board at Antwerp, as such passengers, the petitioners
in this case, and, in receiving them and their luggage, gave them a ticket
containing, among other things, the following: (c) The shipowner or
agent are not under any circumstances liable for loss, death, injury or
delay to the passenger or his baggage arising from the act of God, the
public enemies, fire, robbers, thieves of whatever kind, whether on board
the steamer or not, perils of the seas, rivers or navigation, accidents to
or of machinery, boilers or steam, collisions, strikes, arrest or restraint
of princes, courts of law, rulers or people, or from any act, neglect or
default of the shipowner's servants, whether on board the steamer or not
or on board any other vessel belonging to the shipowner, either in matters aforesaid or otherwise howsoever. Neither the shipowner nor the
agent is under any circumstances or for any cause whatever or however
arising liable to an amount exceeding 250 francs for death, injury or delay of or to any passenger carried under this ticket. The shipowner will
use all reasonable means to send the steamer to sea in a seaworthy state
and well-found but does not warrant her seaworthiness. (d) The shipowner or agent shall not under any circumstances be liable for any loss
or delay of or injury to passengers' baggage carried under this ticket
beyond the sum of 250 francs at which such baggage is hereby valued,
unless a bill of lading or receipt be given therefor and freight paid in advance on the excess value at the rate of one per cent or its equivalent in
which case the shipowner shall only be responsible according to the
terms of the shipowner's form of cargo bill of lading, in use from the
port of departure. There was no proof specially tending to show that
at the time the ticket was issued the attention of the travellers was called
to the fact that it embodied exceptional stipulations relieving the company from liability, or that such conditions were agreed to. Held:
(1) Following the courts below, that the loss must be presumed to have
arisen from imperfect stowage:
(2) That testing the exemptions in the ticket by the rule of public policy,
they were void:
(3) That the arbitrary limitation of 250 francs to each passenger, unaccompanied by any right to increase the amount by an adequate and
reason-able proportional payment, was void.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.

THiE libel by which this action was commenced sought to recover the value of passengers' baggage which it was alleged the
ship had wrongfully failed to deliver. The facts essential to be
borne in mind in order to approach the questions arising for
decision are as follows:
The International Navigation Company, a New Jersey corporation, on December 6, 1897, at the office of its Paris agency,
issued to Mrs. and Miss Bleecker, the wife and daughter of an
officer of the United States Navy, a steamer ticket for a voyage
from Antwerp to New York on the Kensington, a steamer in
the control of the company, advertised to sail from Antwerp on
December the 11th. The ticket was delivered to Mrs. Bleecker,
who at the time made part payment of the passage money.
The baggage of the two passengers was shipped by rail to
Antwerp, to the care of the agent of the company there. Mrs.
Bleecker, at Antwerp, on the 10th of December, paid the remainder of the passage money, and it was entered on the ticket.
The baggage having in the meanwhile been received, the charges
which the agent at Antwerp had advanced were refunded and
a receipt was issued. It was stated therein that the value of
the baggage was unknown, and that it was shipped subject to
the conditions contained in the company's steamer ticket and
bill of lading. Mrs. Bleecker and her daughter embarked, and
the steamer sailed on the 11th of December. The ticket was
subsequently taken up by the purser.
The baggage was stowed in what was known as number 2,
upper steerage deck. The voyage was an exceptionally rough
one, the ship encountering heavy seas and winds, rolled from
thirty-eight to forty-five degrees on either side during the height
of the gale, and was obliged to heave to for about fifteen hours.
On arrival at New York the baggage was found to be totally
destroyed. By constant shifting it had been reduced to an
almost unrecognizable mass, was commingled with d6bris of
broken china and straw, and covered with water. The first
was occasioned by stowing crates of china in the same compartment. The presence of the water was explained by the fact
that an exhaust pipe which passed through the compartment

THE KENSINGTON.
Statement of the Case.

had been broken by the shifting of the contents of the compartment, and hence the exhaust escaped into the compartment.
There is no possible view which can be taken of the facts by
which the loss of the baggage was brought about by which the
ship could be held responsible if the steamer ticket was in and
of itself a complete contract, and all the conditions or exceptions legibly printed on the face thereof were lawful. The
ticket was signed by the agent of the company as Paris, was
countersigned by the agent at Antwerp, but was not signed by
either Mrs. Bleecker or her daughter. One of the conditions
printed on the ticket provided that there should be no liability
to each passenger, "under any circumstances," beyond the sum
of 250 francs, "at which such baggage is hereby valued," unless
an increased value be declared and an additional sum paid as
provided by the condition.
There was no proof tending to show that at the time the
ticket was issued the attention of Mrs. Bleecker or her daughter
was called to the fact that it embodied exceptional stipulations,
relieving the company from liability, or that such conditions
were agreed to, except in so far as a meeting of minds on the
subject may be inferred from the fact of the delivery of the
ticket by the company, and its acceptance, and that it contained
on its face, in small but legible type, among others, the stipulations which are relied upon. The testimony of Mrs. Bleecker
and her daughter was that when the ticket was received it was
put aside without reading it, and that it was not subsequently
examined before it was delivered to the ship's officer. The
District Court held that the loss of the baggage was attributable to bad stowage; that the ticket and the conditions printed
on it were a contract binding upon the parties, so far as the conditions were lawful. The conditions generally relieving from
liability for negligence were held to be void, but the stipulation
as to the value of the baggage was held valid; recovery was
allowed only for the equivalent of 250 francs to each. 88 Fed.

On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the judgment. 94 Fed. Rep. 885.

MR. JUSTICE

The District Court held, although the condition of the
weather might account for the shifting of the baggage, that result could also have arisen from its bad stowage, and in the absence of all proof by the ship that the baggage had been properly stowed, when such proof was peculiarly within its reach,
the loss must be presumed to have arisen from the imperfect
stowage. The Circuit Court of Appeals, whilst in effect agreeing to this conclusion, in addition found that there was proof

in the record tending to sustain the conclusion that the baggage
had been improperly stowed, and that no proof even tending
to rebut this testimony had been offered by the company. As
in the argument at bar the conclusion of the court below on
this subject was not seriously questioned, we content ourselves
with saving that as a matter of fact we find them to be sustained, and therefore pass from their further consideration.
The loss of the baggage being then attributable to improper
stowage, the question is, Was the vessel relieved from the consequence of its fault by the exceptions contained in the passenger ticket? The District Court decided "that a ticket of the
character described for a transatlantic passage is a unilateral
contract, and, like a bill of lading, is binding upon the person
who receives it, so far as its provisions are reasonable and valid."
In other words, the court held, although there was no proof of
the meeting of the minds of the parties upon the subject of
exceptional limitations to be imposed upon the contract of carriage, the receipt and retention of the ticket implied a unilateral
contract embracing the exceptions found in legible characters
on the face of the ticket. And being thus a part of the express
and written contract, the exceptions would be enforced provided
they were just and reasonable. The Circuit Court of Appeals
in effect approved these views of the District Court.

THE KENSINGTON.
Opinion of the Court.

Whilst apparently the question whether there was a unilateral
contract necessarily arises first for consideration, such is not the
case when the situation of the record is taken into view. For
should we, in disposing of this question, determine that the rulings of the court below as to the unilateral contract were correct, we would not thereby be relieved from deciding whether
the conditions embodied in the contract were valid. On the
other band, should we conclude that the conditions relied on
were void, there will be no occasion to determine the question
of contract. We hence invert the logical order of consideration,
and first come to determine whether the conditions enumerated
in the ticket relieved from the responsibility otherwise resulting
from the bad stowage of the baggage. In doing so we shall, of
course, assume, for the purpose of this branch of the case only,
that the conditions relied upon were a part of a unilateral contract, and were binding as far as they were just and reasonable.
It is apparent if the carrier, in transporting the baggage, was
governed by the act of February 13, 1893, c. 105, designated as
the Harter Act, any provision in the ticket exempting from liability for fault in loading or stowage was void because inhibited
by the express provisions of the statute. 27 Stat. 445. As,
however, the view which we take of the conditions expressed in
the ticket will be equally decisive, whether or not the Harter
Act concerns the carriage of passengers and their baggage, it
becomes unnecessary to intimate any opinion as to whether the
provisions of the act in question apply to such contracts. The
exceptions found on the face of the ticket upon which the carrier
depends are as follows:
"(o.) The shipowner or agent are not under any circumstances liable for loss, death, injury or delay to the passenger
or his baggage arising from the act of God, the public enemies,
fire, robbers, thieves of whatever kind, whether on board the
steamer or not, perils of the seas, rivers or navigation, accidents to or of machinery, boilers or steam, collisions, strikes,
arrest or restraint of princes, courts of law, rulers or people, or
from any act, neglect or default of the shipowner's servants,
whether on board the steamer or not, or on board any other
vessel belonging to the shipowner, either in matters aforesaid

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

or otherwise howsoever. Neither the shipowner nor the agent
is under any circumstances, or for any cause whatever or however arising, liable to an amount exceeding 250 francs for
death, injury or delay of or to any passenger carried under this
ticket. The shipowner will use all reasonable meani to send
the steamer to sea in a seaworthy state and well-found, but does
not warrant her seaworthiness.
"(i.) The shipowner or agent shall not under any circumstances be liable for any loss or delay of or injury to passengers'
baggage carried under this ticket beyond the sum of 250 francs,
at which such baggage is hereby valued, unless a bill of lading
or receipt be given therefor and freight paid in advance on
the excess value at the rate of one per cent, or its equivalent,
in which case the shipowner shall only be responsible according to the terms of the shipowner's form of cargo bill of lading,
in use from the port of departure."
It is settled in the courts of the United States that exemptions limiting carriers from responsibility for the negligence of
themselves or their servants are both unjust and unreasonable,
and will be deemed as wanting in the element of voluntary assent; and, besides, that such conditions are in conflict with
public policy. This doctrine was announced so long ago, and
has been so frequently reiterated, that it is elementary. We
content ourselves with referring to the cases of the Baltimore &
O7tio &c. Railway v. Voigt, 176 U. S. 498, 505, 507, and KYnott
v. Botany. ills, 179 U. S. 69, 71, where the previously adjudged cases are referred to and the principles by them expounded are restated.
True it is that by the act of February 13, 1893, 27 Stat. 445,
known as the Harter Act, already adverted to, the general rule
just above stated was modified so as to exempt vessels, when
engaged in the classes of carriage corning within the terms of
the statute, from liability for negligence in certain particulars.
But whilst this statute changed the general rule in cases which
the act embraced, it left such rule in all other cases unimpaired.
Indeed, in view of the well-settled nature of the general rule
at the time the statute was adopted, it must result that legis-

Opinion of the Court.

lative approval was by clear implication given to the general
rule as then existing in all cases where it was not changed.
Testing the exemptions found in the ticket by the rule of
public policy, it is apparent that they were void, since they unequivocally sought to relieve the carrier from the initial duty
of furnishing a seaworthy vessel for all neglect in loading or
stowing, and indeed for any and every fault of commission or
omission on the part of the carrier or his servants. And seeking to accomplish these results, it is equally plain that the conditions were void if their legality be considered solely with reference to the modifications of the general rule created by the
act of 1893.- Ynott v. Botany Xills, supra. As, however, the
ticket was finally countersigned in Belgium, and one of the
conditions printed on its face provides that "all questions arising hereunder are to be settled according to the Belgium law,
with reference to which this contract is made," it is insisted
that such law should be applied, as proof was offered showing
that the law of Belgium authorized the conditions. The contention amounts to this: Where a contract is made in a foreign
country, to be executed at least in part in the United States,
the law of the foreign country, either by its own force or in
virtue of the agreement of the contracting parties, must be enforced by the courts of the United States, even although to do
so requires the violation of the public policy of the United
States. To state the proposition is, we think, to answer it. It
is true, as a general rule, that the lex loci governs, and it is
also true that the intention of the parties to a contract will be
sought out and enforced. But both these elementary principles
are subordinate to and qualified by the doctrine that neither
by comity nor by the will of contracting parties can the public
policy of a country be set at naught. Story, Conflict of Laws,
§§ 38, 244. Whilst as said in Knott v. Botany Xills, the previous
decisions of this court have not called for the application of
the rule of public policy to the precise question here arising,
nevertheless, that it must be here enforced is substantially determined by the previous adjudications of this court. In Liverpool & Great Western Steamn Co. v. PhoenixInmrance Co., 129
U. S. 397, the question arose, whether conditions, exempting a

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

carrier from responsibility for loss caused by the neglect of
himself, or his servants, could be enforced in the courts of the
United States, the bill of lading having been issued in New
York by a British ship for goods consigned to England. Despite the fact that conditions, exempting from responsibility
for loss, arising from negligence, were valid, by the laws of
New York, and would have been upheld in the courts of that
State, it was decided that, in view of the rule of public policy
applied by the courts of the United States, effect would not be
given to the conditions. In the very nature of things, the
premise, upon which this decision must rest, is controlling here,
unless it be said that a contract, made in a foreign country, to
be executed in part in the United States, is more potential to
overthrow the public policy, enforced in the courts of the
United States, than would be a similar contract, validly made,
in one of the States of the Union. Nor is the suggestion that,
because there is no statute expressly prohibiting such contracts,
and because it is assumed no offence against morality is committed in making them, therefore they should be enforced, despite the settled rule of public policy to the contrary. The
existence of the rule of public policy, not the ultimate causes
upon which it may depend, is the criterion. The precise question has been carefully considered and decided in the District
Courts of the United States. In Th/e Guild Hall, 58 Fed. Rep.
796, it was held that a stipulation in a bill of lading issued at
Rotterdam on goods destined to New York, exempting the
carrier from liability for negligence, would not be enforced in
the courts of the United States, although such a condition was
valid under the law of Holland. In The Glenmavis, 69 Fed.
Rep. 472, the same rule was applied to a bill of lading issued
in Germany by a British ship for goods consigned to Philadelphia. Indeed by implication the question is controlled by
statute. We have previously pointed out, under the assumption that the Harter Act does not apply to the carriage of the
baggage of a passenger, that such law, in effect, affirms the
rule of public policy as previously existing in the cases, where
no change was made. But that act expressly prohibits carriers,
engaged in the business which it regulates, from contracting,

Opinion of the Court.

even in a foreign country, for a shipment to the United States
to relieve themselves from negligence in cases where the statute
does not do so. .Knottv. Botany .7ills,,ub. sup. The theory
then, by which alone the conditions relied on in this case can
be enforced despite the public policy which governs, in the
courts of the United States, reduces itself to this: Carriers who
transact a class of business where they are exempt by law, in
many cases, from the consequences of the neglect of themselves,
or their servants, may not overthrow public policy by contracts made in a foreign country for a shipment to the United
States, but carriers who are in no case exempt by the law from
the consequence of their neglect may do so. But this amounts
in last analysis to this: The lesser the immunity from negligence the greater the power to avoid the consequences of negligence.
The general exemptions, from responsibility for negligence
which the ticket embodies being controlled by the rule enforced
in the courts of the United States, and being therefore void, because against public policy, we come to consider the particular
provisions contained in the ticket with reference to the value of
the baggage and the limit of recovery, if any, arising therefrom.
In Railroad Company v. Falo, 100 U. S. 24, 27, it was
said:
"It is undoubtedly competent for carriers of passengers, by
specific regulations, distinctly brought to the knowledge of the
passenger, which are reasonable in their character a-ad not inconsistent with any statute or their duties to the public, to protect themselves against liability, as insurers, for baggage exceeding a fixed amount in value, except upon additional compensation, proportioned to the risk. And in order that such
regulations may be practically effective, and the carrier advised
of the full extent of its responsibility, and, consequently, of the
degree of precaution necessary upon its part, it may rightfully
require, as a condition precedent to any contract for the transportation of baggage, information from the passenger as to its
value; and if the value thus disclosed exceeds that which the
passenger may reasonably demand to be transported as baggage

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

without extra compensation, the carrier, at its option, can make
such additional charge as the risk fairly justifies."
In Ifart v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 112 U. S. 331, the
facts were as follows: A bill of lading was issued for a number
of horses, and the instrument was signed, not only by the carrier, but also by the shipper. By the express provisions of the
bill of lading the right to recover for each horse was limited to
a specified sum. The horses were injured while in transit by
the neglect of the employ~s of the company, and recovery was
sought for a much larger amount than the value fixed in the
bill of lading. The court, in its opinion, stated that it must be
assumed that the rate of freight and the declared valuation had
a due relation one to the other, and that if a greater value had
been declared a higher and not unreasonable charge for the carriage would have been made. It was conceded that the carrier
was liable for the value of the horses as stated in the bill of
lading, but the controversy was whether the limit affixed in the
bill of lading should not be disregarded and a much larger sum,
which it was asserted was the actual value of the horses, be
awarded on the ground that the loss was begotten through the
negligence of the carrier. The court, after reviewing the prior
cases and explicitly reaffirming the doctrine that conditions
were void, because against public policy, by which a carrier was
relieved from the consequences of the negligence of himself or
his servants, said (p. 340):
"The limitation as to the value has no tendency to exempt
from liability for negligence. It does not induce want of care.
It exacts from the carrier the measure of care due to the value
agreed on. The carrier is bound to respond in that value for
negligence. The compensation for carriage is based on that
value. The shipper is estopped from saying that the value is
greater. The articles have no greater value, for the purposes
of the contract of transportation, between the parties to that
contract. The carrier must respond for negligence up to that
value. It is just and reasonable that such a contract, fairly entered into and where there is no deceit practiced on the shipper,
should be upheld. There is no violation of public policy. On
the contrary, it would b unjust and unreasonable, and would

THE KENSINGTON.
Opinion of the Court.

be repugnant to the soundest principles of fair dealing and of the
freedom of contracting, and thus in conflict with public policy,
if a shipper should be allowed to reap the benefit of the contract
if there is no loss, and to repudiate it in case of loss."
It was decided that the carrier was responsible, but his liability was limited to the value expressly agreed upon in the bill
of lading. Did the conditions in the steamer ticket in the case at
bar come within the principle announced in either of the foregoing cases?
One of the conditions reiterated in various forms, in the bill
of lading, is as follows:
"The shipowner or agent shall not under any circumstances
be liable for any loss or delay of or injury to passenger's baggage carried under the ticket, beyond the sum of 250 francs,
at which such baggage is hereby valued, unless a bill of lading
or receipt be given therefor and freight paid in advance on the
excess value at the rate of 1 per cent, or its equivalent, in which
case the shipowner shall only be responsible according to the
terms of the shipowner's form of cargo bill of lading in use
•
from the port of departure."
The requirement, then, was that the baggage of the passenger
must be valued at 250 francs, and no more than that sum could
be recovered under any circumstances, unless any excess of
amount be declared and a named percentage on the increased
value be paid, and unless the passenger agreed to ship his baggage as cargo and take a bill of lading for it. Now the only
theory upon which it can be assumed that the law of 1893, the
Harter Act, does not apply to the carriage of the baggage of a
passenger, is that the statute in question only relates to merchandise shipped as cargo and for which a bill of lading is taken.
The requirement, therefore, if the passenger desired to value
his baggage at a greater sum than 250 francs, was that he must
ship it in such a manner as to bring it within the terms of the
Harter Act. This obvious meaning of the condition is stated
and insisted on in the brief in.
behalf of the carrier, where it is
said:
"The ticket in this case certainly does not fall within the
words 'bill of lading or shipping document,' used in sections 1,
VOL. OLXXXM-18

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

2 and 4 of the Hlarter Act. These are expressions perfectly
well understood in commerce, and apply to bills of lading covering trade shipments, which are almost invariably insured.
That Congress meant by the words ' bill of lading or shipping
document' but one thing, namely, bill of lading, appears from
the refusing to issue on demand ' the bill of lading herein provided for,' and does not mention the words ' shipping document'
at all.
"On the other hand, for personal baggage accompanying the
passenger no bill of lading or shipping document is, so far as
we know, ever given. If the libellants had intended their personal baggage to fall within the provisions of the-Harter Act,
they could have accomplished it, as provided in the ticket itself,
by declaring the value of the baggage over 250 francs, paying
freight on the excess and getting a bill of lading."
The passenger then was subjected to the inevitable alternative of having no recourse whatever for his baggage beyond
the value of 250 francs, unless he agreed that he would subject
it to the Harter Act. But if that law was made applicable its
provisions controlled, and therefore the carrier became entitled
to all the benefits of the third section of the act, exempting
from all loss or damage resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of the vessel, and for other causes
which are specified in the section in question. To make this
exaction was consequently but in effect to demand that the passenger agree, as a prerequisite to any increased valuation of his
baggage, to subject it to a risk of loss brought about by the
negligence of the carrier, when otherwise the baggage would
not have been submitted to risk arising from such neglect-an
obvious requirement exempting the carrier from the consequences of his own negligence. On the other hand, if the assumption be indulged in that the baggage of the passenger was
within the purview of the Harter Act, a stipulation embodied
in another provision of the ticket, relieving the carrier under
any and every circumstance from every conceivable neglect of
his servants, "either in matters aforesaid or otherwise howsoever," was a plain violation of the prohibitions contained in the
second section of the Harter Act. It follows, if the Harter Act

THE KENSINGTON.
Opinion of the Court.

did not apply to the baggage of a passenger, the stipulation
which compelled the passenger, if he wished to value his baggage, to agree to subject it to that act, was an illegal effort on
the part of the carrier to relieve himself from liability for his
negligence. If this result is escaped by treating the baggage
of the passenger as within the scope of the Harter Act, then
there are provisions found in the ticket which are void, because
they contain stipulations for immunity from negligence which
are in direct conflict with the prohibitions of that act. Indeed,
the conditions contained in the ticket seem to have been devised
-at all events, they lend themselves to the inference that they
were devised-to so operate as to keep the baggage of the passenger outside of the scope of the Harter Act, in order to avoid
the provisions of that act forbidding the insertion of certain
conditions as to negligence, and when this result was obtained to immediately secure the bringing of the passenger's
baggage within the influence of the act for the purpose of enabling the carrier to enjoy the immunity from negligence which
that act accords in certain cases. We think the conditions were
unjust and unreasonable and void because in conflict with public policy. And if the considerations which have led us to this
conclusion be for a moment put aside, it is far from clear that
other conditions contained in the ticket would not, from another point of view, lead to the same result. In addition to
the exaction with which the right to state an excess of value
over 250 francs was burdened, the ticket contains a provision
to the effect that, whatever be the value of the baggage, under
no circumstances will the carrier be liable for the neglect of
himself or his servants. Giving effect, then, to all the provisions of the ticket, it may be doubted whether it does not result
from them that not only was the baggage when valued at 250
francs, but also when valued at any increased amount, subjected to any and every risk arising from the negligence of the
carrier or his servants.
It remains only to consider whether, although the conditions
found in the ticket be void because against public policy, recovery for the baggage lost must be limited to the sum of 250
francs because of the statement of that amount in one of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.

provisions of the ticket. It is to be doubted whether in reason
it can be said that the limit as fixed in the ticket can be separated from the context in which it is found, and be deemed to
be an independent valuation fixed by the parties irrespective of
the right to name an increased sum stated in the same provision of the ticket which contains the valuation. But if it can
be treated as a separate valuation, unaccompanied by the conditions attached to it, and from which it takes its origin, then
the question is this: Is it just and reasonable for a transatlantic
carrier to put an absolute limit of 250 francs, about the equivalent of $50, as the value of the baggage of a cabin passenger,
whether first or second class, and to refuse, except upon illegal
conditions, to allow any greater sum to be carried as baggage?
In The lajestic, 166 U. S. 375, the liability of the ship for
baggage was under consideration. No contention was made
that the ticket was not a contract, but the question was whether
the conditions printed on the back were a part of the assumed
contract and, if so, were they valid. One of the conditions
limited recovery to £10 for each passenger, unless a greater
sum was declared and paid for. The right to declare the larger
value was not burdened with the illegal condition found in the
ticket now under consideration. Had it been otherwise, the
requirement would not have had the same significance, as the
ticket considered in The ]Yajestie was issued prior to the adoption of the Harter Act, and, therefore, whether the baggage
was carried as such, or as cargo, it would have equally enjoyed
an immunity from loss, brought about by the negligence of the
carrier, or his servants. The ticket considered, in The -JMajestic
as does the one now before us, allowed a capacity of "twenty
cubical feet of luggage for each person." The court, in The
.Afajestic, commenting on the restriction to £10 for each passenger, said it was a (p. 386) "limitation which, we must say,
does not strike us as exactly reasonable, in view of the ' twenty
cubical feet of luggage which the company had expressly contracted to carry.' . . ." It was decided, in The 2fajestic,
that, even on the hypothesis of a contract, evidenced by the
ticket, the conditions on the back were not binding. The present case does not require us to decide whether the sum of 250

THE KENSINGTON.
Opinion of the Court

francs would be a reasonable limit if the right to fix a larger
amount was not incumbered with the illegal and arbitrary
conditions which are here presented. We express no opinion
on such question. .iManifestly, what is a reasonable maximum
amount when a larger value is allowed to be carried as baggage by paying an additional compensation, is a different question from what is a reasonable amount where the right to
declare and pay for a larger sum is refused, or what is equivalent thereto is permitted only upon condition that the passenger
subjects himself to conditions which are void as against public
policy. Indeed, the Circuit Court of Appeals adverted, in its
opinion in this case, to the suggestion made in The Afajestic,
and said that the limit of 250 francs was reasonable, because of
the right given the passenger to increase the amount by paying
a larger but reasonable compensation. As we hold that no
such right was allowed because its enjoyment was burdened
with conditions which were void because against public policy
the only reason upon which the justness of the limit was sustained ceases to apply.
In view of the nature and duration of the voyage, of the circumstances which may be reasonably deemed to environ transatlantic cabin passengers, and the objects and purposes which it
may also be justly assumed the persons who undertake such a
voyage have in view, we think the arbitrary limitation of 250
francs to each passenger, unaccompanied by any right to increase the amount by an adequate and reasonable proportional
payment, was void. It is therefore unnecessary to decide
whether the ticket delivered and received, under circumstances
