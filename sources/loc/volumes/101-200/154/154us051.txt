APPEAL FROM

THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF THE

UNITED

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 21. Argued April 6, 9,1894.-Decided May 26,1894.

In the bill of lading of a quantity of cases and bales of goods delivered to
the National Steamship Company at Liverpool, and addressed and consigned to C. in New York, it was provided as follows: "Shipped in good
order and well conditioned . . . in and upon the steamship called
the Egypt . . . bound for New York . . . forty-three cases
merchandise . . . being marked and numbered as in the margin,
and to be delivered subject to the following exceptions and conditions:
. The National Steamship Company or its agents or any of its servants are not to be liable for any damage to any goods which is capable
of being covered by insurance . . . nor for any claims for loss
. . . where the loss occurs while the goods are not actually in the
possession of the company. . . . The goods to be taken alongside
by the consignee immediately the vessel is ready to discharge, or otherwise they will be landed by the master and deposited at the expense
of the consignee, and at his risk of hire, loss, or injury in the warehouse

port of New York shall direct. . . . The United States Treasury

at New York, any goods so left by consignee will be at his or their risk
of fire, loss, or injury." The Egypt arrived January 31, 1883, was entered
at the custom-house at 1.45 P.m. of that day, and, there being no room
for her at the pier of the National Company, where the vessels of that
company were usually unladen, was taken to the pier of the Inman Company. A collector's permit was given to unload the steamer and to
allow the unpermitted cargo to remain on the wharf for forty-eight
hours, upon an agreement by the steamship company, which was given,
that the goods should be at the sole risk of that company, who would
pay to the' consignee or owner the value of such cargo respectively as
might be stolen, burned, or otherwise lost. Notice of the time and place
of the discharge was then posted upon the bulletin board of the customhouse, in accordance with custom, but no notice was sent to C., nor did
he have any notice. The cases and bales consigned to him were on the
same day landed on the Inman pier, but he had no knowledge of it, and
had no opportunity to remove the goods on that day; and, if he had had
such knowledge, there was not sufficient time for him to have entered,
paid the duties, obtained the permits for their removal, and removed
them. On the night of that day the goods were destroyed by fire, without any imputed negligence to the National Steamship Company. Held,
(1) That the stipulation in the bill of lading that respondent should not
be liable for a fire happening after unloading the cargo was reasonable and valid;
(2) That the discharge of the cargo at the Inman pier was not in the
eye of the law a deviation such as io render the carrier an insurer
of the goods so unladen;
(8) That if any notice of such unloading was required at all, the
bulletin posted in the custom-house was sufficient under the
practice and usages of the port of New York;
(4) That libellants, having taken no steps upon the faith of the cargo
being unladen at respondent's pier, were not prejudiced by the
change;
(5) That the agreement of the respondent with the collector of customs
to pay the consignee the value of the goods wis not one of which
the libellants could avail themselves as adding to the obligations
of their contract with respondent.

Tins was a libel in admiralty by the firm of Arnold, Constable & Co. against the National Steamship Coi pany, owner
of the British steamship gypt, to recover the value of thirtysix cases of merchandise carried by this steamer from Liverpool
to New York, delivered on the pier of the Inman Steamship
Company on Tanuary 31, 1883, and upon the same night
destroyed by fire through the alleged negligence of the
respondent. The answer admitted most of the material

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Statement of the Case.

allegations of the libel, but denied all charges of negligence,
and also of liability for the loss of the merchandise.
Upon a hearing upon pleadings and proofs in the District
Court, the libel was dismissed, (29 Fed. Rep. 184,) and upon
appeal to the Circuit Court, the decree was affirmed.
Libellants thereupon appealed to this court.
The following is an abstract of the facts found by the
Circuit Court, so far as the same are material to the questions
involved:
"2. The Egypt was one ofa line of steamers owned by the
respondent, and plying regularly between Liverpool and New
York as common carriers. The steamers of this line arrived
as often as from three to eight times per month.
"3. Respondent has run a line of such steamers for over
twenty years, and during that time has docked them at a
dozen different piers in the city of New York. From 1872 to
1878 it leased the pier No. 36, (old No. 44,) North River, and
usually docked its vessels there. Subsequently it leased pier
No. 39, North River, about six hundred feet north of pier No.
36, and has since usually docked its vessels there, and not
elsewhere. The piers between Nos. 35 and 41, North River,
(excluding pier No. 37,) were in 1883 all used by regular
English steamship lines. These lines usually dock at their
own piers, but not always, and in case of any emergency dock
elsewhere, and permit each other, when the necessity arises,
to use the exclusive dock of each.
"4. That said goods were shipped at the port of Liverpool
on board the Egypt, and were consigned to the libellants at
New York under a bill of lading, the material portions of
which are cited in the opinion. - (A copy is also given in the

Statement of the Case.

"11. Upon the entry at the custom-house of the Egypt.
there was granted by the collector of customs a general order
to unload the steamer, and to send packages to the public
store. An application was also immediately made to the
collector to allow the unpermitted cargo to remain upon the
wharf for forty-eight hours from the time of the granting of
the general order. This application was in the following form:

"To W. H. RoBERTsoN, Esq., Collector of Customs.
"Request is hereby made to allow the cargo of the steamer
Egypt, Sumner, from Liverpool, England, unladen but not
permitted, to remain upon the wharf for fortyr-eight hours
from the time of granting general order, at the sole risk of
the owners of said steamer, who will pay to the consignee or
owner the value of the such cargo respectively as may be stolen,
burned or otherwise lost, and who will also pay all duties
which may be in any way lost by so remaining.
"F. J. W. HunsT, Owner,
"Per J. C. RYoR, Attorney."
"Such application was in the form required by the collector,
without which permit would not be granted, and the entire
cargo would be sent to public store. A permit was granted
by the collector upon this application. A special license was
also granted to unload the steamship after sunset, and a bond
in $20,000 was given for such license, as required by law.
"12. The general order above stated, the special license, the
applications and permits, and the agreements and engagements
therein contained were the usual and customary ones ordinarily
made and granted in such cases, and were made under and by
the authority in the bill of lading conferred upon the respondent and upon the collector of the port, and in accordance
with the provisions of law and the regulations of the Treasury
Department in that behalf."
"14. Under these several orders and permits, a portion of the
cargo of the Egypt, including libellants' merchandise; was discharged and landed upon the Inman dock, where the same
was destroyed by fire about two o'clock the next morning.
That said cargo, including said merchandise belonging to

libellants, was at the time of its destruction aforesaid, in the
possession of the respondent, and had never been taken into
the possession of the collector of the said port of New York.
That said fire broke out without any imputed negligence, and
that by it the steamer was also somewhat burned.
"15. That between the arrival of the steamer and the destructio'i- of the merchandise there was not sufficient time in
which to enter libellants' goods at the custom-house, pay the
duties thereon, and obtain the requisite permits for the remeoval of the same. That, in fact, no duties were paid upon
libellants' goods, and no permits obtained prior to the destruction of the goods by fire; that said goods were at the time of
their destruction 'unpermitted' goods.
"16. That upon obtaining the permits referred to, the respondent's custoni-house broker caused a notice of the time
and place of discharge to be posted on the bulletin board of
the custom-house. It is usual to so post such notices. It is
not usual to publish them in the newspapers.
"17. No notice; was ever sent to or received by the libellants, nor did they have any actual knowledge of the readiness to discharge, or of the time or place of discharge of the
Egypt upon her arrival.
"18. Libellants never knew that the merchandise had been
landed and deposited upon the Inman dock, and never had an
opportunity of removing such merchandise."
The other facts, so far as they are material, are stated in the
opinion of the court..
Upon such facts the Circuit Court found, as conclusions of
law, that respondent had the right to dock and discharge the
Egypt at the Inman pier; that it was exempt from liability
for the goods destroyed by 'fire on such pier; and that there
was, by reason of the application to the collector to allow the
unpermitted cargo to remain on tho wharf, no valid agreement or binding obligation to pay the libellants the value of
the goods burned.

A brief for the same

BROwIw delivered the opinion of the court.

This case involves the liability of a steamship company for
the loss by fire of' a consignment of goods unloaded without
personal notice to the consignee upon the wharf of a company
other than the one owning the vessel.
By the Limited Liability Act, Rev. Stat. § 4282, no ship
owner is liable to answer for the loss of any merchandise
shipped upon his vessel by reason of any fire "happening to
or on board the vessel, unless such fire is caused by the design
or neglect of such owner," and in the case of The Scotland,
105 U. S. 24, the exemptions and limitations of this act were
held to apply to foreign as well as domestic vessels. A similar exemption from fire happening without the "fault or
privity" of the owner is contained in the British Merchants'
Shipping Act of 1854, 17 and 18 Vict. c. 104, § 503. The bill
of lading in this case also contains an exemption of liability
from loss caused by fire "before loading in the ship or after
unloading." There is no comma after the word "loading" or
"ship," but obviously it should be read as if there were. In
view of the fact that, under no aspect of the case would the
owner of the vessel be liable for the consequence of any fire
occurring on board of such vessel without his fault, and that
an attempt is made in thi' case to impose the liability, not of
a warehouseman, but of a common carrier and insurer against
fire, after the contract of carriage had been fully performed,
it would seem that such liability ought not to be raised out
of the contract in this case except upon clear evidence, and
for the most cogent reasons. The liability of the company
for the goods while upon the wharf is a mere incident tb its
liability for them while upon the ship, and if the liability is
more extensive under the incidental contract of storage than
it was under the principal contract of carriage, it is an exception to the gener'ai rule that the incidental liability of a
contracting party is not broader than his liability upon the
principal contract.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

Two facts are mainly relied upon in this case for holding
the respondent company to the liabilities of an insurer:
1. That the Egypt did not unload at her usual wharf, but
at what is known as the Inman pier, and that no actual notice
was given to the libellants of such unloading.
2. In the application to the collector to allow the unpermitted cargo of the steamer to remain upon the wharf for
forty-eight hours there was a stipulation that it should be "at
the sole risk of owners of said steamer."
We shall proceed to dispose of these questions in their
order.
1. As bearing upon the liability of the vessel after the cargo
is unladen the following exemptions in the bill of lading are
pertinent and necessary to be considered:
(1) "Fire before loading, in the ship, or after unloading."
(2) "The National Steamship Company, (Limited,) or its
agents or any of its servants are not to be liable for any damage to any goods which is capable of -being covered by insurance."
(3) "The goods to be taken from alongside by the consignee
immediately the vessel is ready to discharge, or otherwise they
will be landed by the master and deposited at the expense of
the consignee and at his risk of fire, loss, or injury in the warehouse provided for that purpose, or in the public store, as the
collector of the port of New York shall direct, and when
deposited in the warehouse or store, to be subject to storage,
the collector of the port being hereby authorized to grant a
general order for di.charge immediately after entry of the ship."
It is admitted that, under what may be termed the common
law of the sea, a delivery of the cargo, to discharge the carrier
from his liability, must be made upon the usual wharf of the
vessel and actual notice be given to the consignee, if he be
known. This was the ruling of this court in the case of The
Tangier, (Richardson v. Goddard,) 23 How. 28, 39, and The
Eddy, 5 Wall. 481, and is in conformity with the great weight
of English and American autbority. Yyde v. Trent and .Mersey Navigation Co., 5 T. R. 389; GibonsV. Culver, 17 Wend.
305; 1 Parsous.on Shipping, 222.

CONSTABLE v. INATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Opinion of the Court.

This rule, however, originated prior to the era of steam nav-

igation, when a voyage from Liverpool to New York rarely
consumed less than three weeks; when the time of the arrival
of the vessel could not be forecast with any accuracy; when
crews were discharged immediately upon her arrival; and the
vessel was usually detained several weeks in the slow and
laborious process of unloading, taking on cargo, and refitting
before setting out upon another voyage. Such methods of
delivery were found wholly inadequate to the necessities of
modern commerce, and particularly to the comparatively short
voyages of the large transatlantic passenger steamers, which
are kept permanently equipped with large and expensive
crews, at a cost of several hundred dollars per day, and in
order to be profitably employed must be kept in almost constant motion. In such cases the consignees of the cargo may
be numbered by the hundreds, and a requirement that each
consignee shall have a personal notice of the unloading of the
cargo, in order to relieve the carrier from responsibility, would
necessitate delays which might consume the entire profits of
the voyage. It is of the utmost importance that the discharge
of the cargo shall be'gin as soon as possible after the vessel
arrives at her wharf, and if the consignee may sometimes be
spurred to greater diligence, or put to some inconvenience in
removing his consignments, he receives a compensation in the
lower rate of freight the vessel is thereby enabled to charge.
To obviate the difficulties attendant upon the ancient
method of discharging, the regular steamship lines are in the
habit of providing themselves with wharves having covered
warehouses, into which the cargo is discharged, and of inserting in their bills of lading stipulations similar to those found
in this case, viz., that the responsibility of the vessel shall
cease after the goods are discharged, and thus of extending
their statutory exemption from fire to such as may occur before loading or after unloading. In view of the fact that the
piers of the regular steamship lines are well known to every
importer, and the day of arrival of each steamer may be predicted almost to a certainty, we perceive nothing unreasonable
in this stipulation. An importer, having reason to anticipate

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

the arrival of goods by a certain steamer, by putting himself
in communication with the office of the company, may usually secure a notice of several hours of the actual arrival of
the vessel at her wharf. It seems, too, by the sixteenth finding in this case, that, in lieu of a personal notice to each consignee or of publication through the papers, a custom has
grown up in the port of New York of posting on a bulletin
board in the custom-house a notice of the time and place of
discharge. Taking all these facts into consideration, we see
no impropriety in the company limiting itself to the liability
of a warehouseman with respect to the goods so discharged
into its. own warehouse. Indeed, as applied to the usual
wharf of the steamer, we do not understand it to be seriously
questioned in this case. In fact, an argument appears to have
been made in the District Court to the effect that the Limited
Liability Act applied to this fire to exonerate the company,
but the court heldi and doubtless properly, that a fire originating upon the dock could not be said to have "happened to the
ship" within the meaning of section 4282, even though the
fire extended to and did some damage to the vessel. .Morewood v. Pollok, 1 El. & Bl. 743. No good reason, however, is
perceived why, if a wise policy requires the exemption of the
carrier from a fire occurring without his fault, such exemption
should not extend to any such fire while the goods are in his
possession and under his control, or at any time before actual
delivery to the consignee. Bht, 1 -- -ever this may be, there
can be no question of the power of the carrier to extend his
statutory exemption from fire to such as occur after the discharge of the cargo, by special stipulation to that effect in the
bill of lading. Thus in York Co. v. 'entraZ Railroad,3 Wall.
107, it was held that the common law liability of a carrier
might be limited by special contract with the owner, and that
the exemption in a bill of lading from losses by fire was sufficient to protect the carrier, if the fire were not occasioned by
any want of due care on his part. See also The Lexington,
(New Jersey Steam _Aravigatiom Co. v. Merchants' Bank,) 6
How. 344, 382; Railroad Co. v. Manufacturing Co., 16 Wall.
318; Phmix Jis. Co. v. Erie TransportationCo., 117 U. S.

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEA.SHTI? CO.
Opinion of the Court.

312. Indeed, a general exemption from the consequences of
fire has been held to extend not only to fires happening on
board the vessel, but to fires occurring to .the goods while on
the wharf awaiting transportation. Scott v. Baltimore &c.
Steamboat Co., 19 Fed. Rep. 56.
No rule is better settled than that the delivery must be according to the custom and usage of the port, and such delivery
will discharge the carrier of his responsibility. Thus in Dick8o v. Dunham, 14 Illinois, 324, it was said that "it was competent for the defendant," the carrier, "to set up a custom or
usage in the port of Chicago, that goods should be delivered'
at the wharf selected by the master of the vessel, and that
consignees should receive their goods there, with the averment
of knowledge of such a custom in the plaintiff, and that this
contract was made in accordance with it." So also in Gatlife
v. Bourne, 4 Bing. (N. C.) 314, 329, Chief Justice Tindall
said: "We know of no general rule of law which governs the
delivery of a bill of goods under a bill of lading, where such
delivery is not expressly according to the terms of the bill of
lading, except that it must be a delivery according to the practice and custom usually observed in the port or place of delivery." See also Farmers' and fechanics' Bank v. Champlain
Transportation Co., 23 Vermont, 186; The Tangier, 1 Cliff.
396; Richmond v. Union Steamboat Co., 87 N. Y. 240; Gibson v. Culver, 17 Wend. 305; The Boston, 1 Lowell, 464. In
The Sultana v. Chapman, 5 Wisconsin, 454, there was a delivery at a place where the court held the boat had no right to
leave the goods, and they were there destroyed. Under such
circumstances, notwithstanding the exception in the bill of
lading, the carrier was held not to be exempted from liability
for the loss. "He had no right," said the court, "to place
these goods where he did; and having done so, and a loss
having ensued, he must be held responsible for it, as being
occasioned by his own negligence or misconduct."
While there is no express provision in the bill of lading in
this case dispensing with notice to the consignee, the provision
that the goods shall be taken from alongside by the consignee
immediately the vessel is ready to discharge, is inconsistent

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

with the idea of, personal notice, since such a notice would
necessitate a delay of one or two days in the discharge of the
cargo, while the notices were being given. If the goods were
not taken by the consignee the carrier. was authorized to deposit them at the risk of the consignee "in the warehouse provided for that purpose," meaning, of course, the warehouse
upon the pier. His obligation to give notice, if any such
existed, must, under the terms of the bill of lading allowing
an immediate discharge of the cargo, be cotemporaneous with
such discharge, and too late to be of any avail to the consignee. Such notice appears to have been given in this case,
as the libellants' broker in his testimony, to which we have
been referred, says: "The invoice and bills of lading were
sent down to me on the 31st of January, and the entries made
out,

.

.

and lodged in the custom-house at twenty-five

minutes past two." In GleadeZl v. Townson, 56 N. Y. 194,
1"97, it was said of a similar stipulation in a bill of lading, that
the goods should be taken from alongside by the consignee
immediately the vessel is ready to discharge: "The landing
of the goodsupon the pier of the plaintiff, under the circumstances of this case, did not, we think, change his relation to
the goods, and divest him of his custody of them as a carrier.
The privilege to make this diposition of them was secured to
him by the bill of lading, unless the consignee was ready to
take the goods from the ship whenever it was ready to discharge. It was not incumbent upon the plaintiff to give
notice of a readiness to discharge the goods as a condition of
his exercising the privilege of depositing them upon the pier.
They, however, remained after such deposit in his custody as
carrier, subject to the modified responsibility, created by the
contract, until after notice had been given to the consignees
of their arrival, and a reasonable time had elapsed for their
removal. Meanwhile the defendants assumed the risk of
'fire, loss, or injury' to the goods, according to the contract,
but the language used did not exempt the plaintiff from liability for an injury resulting from his own negligence."
The cases relied upon by the libellants do not support their
contention. In the case of The Santee, 7 Blatchford, 186, a

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Opinion of the Court.

bill of lading covering a shipment of cotton, contained a clause
that the cotton should be at the risk of the consignee as soon
as delivered from the tackles of the vessel at the port of
destination. It appeared that the consignee had proper notice
of the arrival of the vessel, and of her discharge, and an
opportunity by reasonable diligence to identify his cotton and
receive it. The cotton was placed safely on the wharf, when
discharged, and a portion of it, belonging to the libellants,
was removed by some other person, but was not actually
delivered by the agents of the vessel to such other party. It
was held that the vessel was not liable for the loss. It is true
that, in delivering the opinion, it was said the carrier was still
bound to give suitable in.formation to the consignees, to enable
them to attend and receive the goods, and themselves assume
and exercise that care and responsibility of which the carrier
was to be relieved. But notice in this case was admitted to
have been given, and the only question was whether under
the bill of lading the carrier was liable after the cotton was
discharged, and it was held that he was not. Nor was he
"bound to watch the property after it passed beyond the
vessel's tackles, to see that it was kept safe or protected from
removal through mistake or design, by third persons."
In Collins v. Burns, 63 N. Y. 1, the bill of lading contained
a stipulation much like the one under consideration, and it
was held that the clause providing for immediate discharge
into the warehouse at the risk of the consignee of fire, loss, or
injury, did not exonerate the carrier for delivering goods to
the wrong party, or to a drayman who was not authorized to
receive them. The Court of Appeals, however, held expressly
that the liability of defendants was that of warehousemen,
and, therefore, that they were responsible only for negligence.
So in Tarbell v. Royal Exchange Skipping Co., 110 N. Y.
170, the goods were discharged from the ship and deposited
on a proper wharf, and after the consignees had had three
full days to remove them, it was discovered that a part had
been removed from the wharf by some one without the
authority of the consignees. It was held that, as the loss
occurred after the lapse of a reasonable time for removal of
VOL. cLiv-5

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

the goods by the consignees, after notice of arrival, defendant
was not liable as a common carrier, but that the defendant
was negligent in omitting to take ordinary care of the goods,
and allowing them to be removed without taking receipts. It
was expressly held, however, that the liability of defendant
as carrier terminated with the delivery of the goods upon -the
wharf, and that its liability arose from its negligence in delivering them to the wrong person.
It is claimed, however,, that the bertbing of this ship at a
pier other than her own was in legal effect a deviation, which
rendered the company an ihsurer of the cargo discharged at
such pier without notice, until its actual delivery to the. consignee. In the law maritime a deviation is defined as a
"voluntary departure without necessity, or any reasonable
cause, from the regular and-usual course of the ship insured."

-Davis v. Garrett, 6 Bing. 716; Williams v. Grant,1 Connecticut, 487; as, for instance, where a ship bound from New
York to Norwich, Conn., went outside of Long Island, and lost
her cargo in a storm, Crosby v. Fitch, 12 Conn. 410; or where
a carrier is guilty of unnecessary delay in pursuing a voyage,
or in the transportation of goods by rail. .Michaelsv. N . .

customary incident of the voyage, and according to the known
usage of trade, it neither avoids a policy of insurance, nor
subjects the carrier to the responsibility of an insurer. Oliver

Catlett, 12 Wheat. 383. In Ifostetter v. Park, 137 U. S. 30,
it was held to be no deviation, in the Pittsburg and New
Orleans barge trade, to land and tie up a tow of barges, and
detagh from the tow such barge or barges as were designated
to take on cargo en route, and to tow the same to the several
points where the cargo might be stored, it having been shown
that such delays were within the general and established usage
of the trade. So, in Graciev. -Marine Ins. Co., 8 Cranch, 75,
it was held to be no deviation to land goods at a lazaretto or
quarantine station, if the usage of the trade permitted it,
though by the bill of -lading the goods were "to be safely

landed at Leghorn." See also Phe4ps v. Hill, 1 Q. B. D.
(1891) 605.
In this connection the findings are:
(3) That the regular English steamship lines usually dock
at their own piers, but not always, and, in case of any emergency, dock elsewhere, and permit each other, when the
necessity arises, to use the exclusive dock of each. (7) That
for a month or more before January 31, 1883, respondent had
been blocked up at its own pier, Io. 39, in consequence of
heavy cargoes, delays of its vessels by westerly winds and ice
in the slips, and had, in consequence, been obliged to discharge two of its vessels at outside uncovered piers. (9) That
steamers of regular lines, on their arrival at the port of *New
York, if their docks are blocked, are not kept in the stream
longer than to enable them to berth elsewhere. If kept in the
stream consignors make great complaint. It was more costly
to dock the Egypt at pier No. 36, but it was done to secure to
the consignees a more prompt discharge and delivery of their
goods. (26) That pier No. 36, North River, was a fit and
proper place to discharge the steamship Egypt at the time
in question and to discharge from her libellants' goods.
If it be true that the pier of the respondent company was
so blocked that the Egypt could not obtain access to it to
discharge her cargo, it was, so far from being a deviation, a
matter of ordinary prudence to select a neighboring pier for
that purpose. Had this cargo been discharged at a remote,
unusual, or inaccessible spot, or upon an uncovered pier, so
that it was exposed to the weather or to any unusual hazard,
and a loss had been incurred, we should not have hesitated to
hold the carrier liable, notwithstanding the stipulation against
the consequence of negligence in its bill of lading. Railroad
Co. v. lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, 359; The Aline, 19 Fed.
Rep. 875; lY]e Boslennct Bay, 22 Fed. Rep. 662. No such
question, however, is presented here. While the libel alleges
that the loss occurred through the negligence of the respondent, no effort was made to prove this, and there is no finding
that such was the case. Indeed, there is nothing to indicate
that the Inman pier was not a perfectly proper place to

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

discharge a cargo, or that it was not equipped with the usual
appliances for the extinguishment of fires.
It is insisted, however, that libellants had a right to suppose
that the Egypt would discharge her cargo at her regular pier,
and that, while they might be bound to take notice of that
fact, they were entitled, if she selected another pier, to a
personal notice of the time and place of delivery, that an
opportunity might be given them to be present and receive
their consignments. But if, under the usages of trade or the
necessities of the particular case, it was allowable and proper
for the respondent to select another pier for the discharge of
its cargo, we do not understand that its obligation to its
consignees was thereby increased or modified, at least unless
the libellants can show that they were actually prejudiced by
such change. Practically the same questions are involved,
viz., whether if she had discharged at her own wharf, the
company was bound to give notice before it could relieve
itself of its responsibility. The real question still is whether,
if she had gone to her own wharf, and the fire had occurred
under the same circumstances, the vessel would have been
liable for the loss. It was for the mutual advantage of the
ship and the consignees that the cargo should be unloaded at
the earliest possible moment -the ship, that she might discharge herself of responsibility and take on her return cargo
consignees, that they might secure their goods as soon
-the
as possible. The North River piers in that neighborhood
were all used by steamers engaged in the Liverpool trade.
The pier selected was only six hundred feet from the regular
pier of the line, and inquiry at that pier would doubtless have
apprised libellants, or their agent, where the Egypt was
actually discharging her cargo.
In addition to this there is a finding that, upon obtaining
the permits for the immediate unloading of the cargo, the
respondent's custom-house broker caused a notice of the time
andoplace of discharge to be posted on a bulletin board in the
custom-house; that it is usual to post such notices, and is not
usual to publish them in the newspapers. It is true there was
an exception taken to this finding upon the ground that there

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.

69

Opinion of the Court.

was no evidence in support of it. The testimony, however,
of the witness Ryor, the custom-house broker, was to the
effect that he attended to getting out the usual papers for the
respondent company to allow the discharge and to passing all
theit steamers through the custom-house; that, on the arrival
of the Egypt, the captain brought the manifest, took the
usual oath, and made out applications for the usual permits to
land goods, discharge at night, and to allow the goods to
remain on the wharf. "We get the permit taken out, signed
by the naval officer and collector, and after the permits are all
taken out, we usually post a notice where the vessel will
discharge (giving copy of notice). I have no reason to
suppose the notice was not posted in this case. It is done in
every case. I am not positive whether it was done in this
case, but it is a part of the routine of entering a vessel to do
so. I have no doubt it was done." The witness evidently
had no definite recollection of this particular notice, but he
had no doubt that he pursued his usual course in posting it.
Respondent's agent also testifies that it was always usual to
put up such notice at the custom-house. The custom-house
broker for the libellants, Arnold Constable & Company, testified mn this connection that the invoice and bills of lading of
the. Egypt were sent down to him on January 31; that the
entries were made and lodged in the custom-house at twentyfive minutes past two. "I knew where the board is where
they put up notices of arrivals and the steamer's discharge.
. That is around the corner going into the cashier's
'office. .
.
It isn't any great distance. .
.
I never
look at that unless I want to find out where a vessel was
discharged, a strange vessel; possibly I might look then; I
have not looked there for years." While this testimony is
not direct and positive to the fact sought to be proven, it
creates, vheu aided by the ordinary presumption arising from
the course of business, a strong probability that the notice
was posted. The practice, even of a private office, if well
established, is presumed to have been followed in individual
cases, and is accepted as sufficient proof of the fact in question
when primary evidence of such fact is wanting. 1 Greenl. Ev.

1 Salk. 285; Chkmpneys v. Peck, 1 Stark. 404; Pritt v. Fairclough, 3 Camp. 305; Doe v. Turford, 3 B. & Ad. 890, 895;
Dana v. Kemble, 19 Pick. 112. We think the conclusion of
the court was justified by the evidence in this particular.
But, even supposing that actual notice had been given, it
could not have been given before the arrival of the ship, and
the names of the consignees were known, and it would then
have been too late for the libellants to take their goods away.
The findings are that the Egypt was entered at the customhouse at forty-five minutes past one in the afternoon; that
she began to discharge her cargo at half-past four, and that
libellants' merchandise was discharged prior to the fire.
(15) And that between the time of the arrival of the
steamer and the destruction of the merchandise, there was
not sufficient time in which to enter the libellants' goods at
the custom-house, pay the duties thereon, and obtain the
requisite permits for the removal of the same. If, then, it be
true that libellants could not have removed their goods before
the fire, it is difficult to see how the want of a notice could
have contributed to the loss. We are clearly of the opinion
that, under the custom of the port and exigencies of the service, there was no- obligation to delay the discharge of the
cargo until notice could be given, and a reasonable time had
elapsed before the goods could be taken away. While the
nineteenth finding is to the effect that libellants had, before
this consignment, received from the respondent company six
other consignments under bills of lading in the same form, all
of which were landed and discharged on their own pier, there
is nothing to indicate that libellants took any steps whatever
upon the faith of such previous practice, made any inquiries
as to when the Egypt was expected, or at what pier she
would discharge her cargo. Indeed, while their own broker
was at the custom-house attending to the entry of these
goods, he did not even take the trouble to look at the bulletin
to see where the Egypt was being discharged. If libellants
had shown that, relying upon the previous practice, they were
ready at pier No. 36 to receive the cargo, or were misled by

CONSTABLE v. IATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Opinion of the Court.

the discharge at pier No. 39, they would have shown a much
stronger title to recover. The inference is irresistible that,
even if the Egypt had discharged at her own wharf, they
would not have been there to receive, and could not have
received their consignments, which would have been stored
in the company's warehouse, and exposed to the same danger
of fire -in other words, the delivery at the Inman dock did
not in any legal sense contribute to the loss. There was no
stipulation in the bill of lading that the Egypt would unload at No. 36, from which a duty to give notice might be
implied, if she were compelled to select another pier.
Upon the facts of this case exhibiting a necessity for a
discharge elsewhere than at her own pier, and in the absence
of any evidence that libellants were prejudiced by the failure
of the Egypt to discharge at her usual wharf, we think there
was no breach of duty on the part of respondent in this
particular.
2. Another serious question, however, is presented by the
proviso in the application to allow the unpermitted cargo to
remain upon the wharf, viz., that it should remain "at the
sole risk of owners of said steamer, who will pay the consignee
or owner the value of, such cargo respectively as may be
stolen, burned, or otherwise lost, and who will also pay all
duties on cargo which may be in any way lost by so
remaining."
It seems that, upon the arrival of a transatIantic steamer, it
is usual to apply for and obtain a general order to allow to
be landed and sent to the public store 1(not the warehouse on
the wharf) all packages for which no special permit or order
shall have been received; also, a permit to allow such portion
of the cargo as is unladen, but not permitted, to remain upon
the wharf for forty-eight hours from the time of the granting
of the above general order, at the expiration of which time
they are sent to the proper general order store; and also a
special license to permit the cargo to be unladen at night.
These orders, licenses, and permits are granted in pursuance
of the general regulations of the Treasury Department.
Granting that the request made by the company is, upon

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

its face, broad enough to impose upon the company the responsibility for goods lost by fire, it must be construed in connection with the following stipulation upon the same subject
in the bill of lading, viz.: "1Thegoods to be taken from
alongside by the consignee immediately the vessel is ready to
discharge.

.

.

The collector of the port being hereby

authorized to grant a general order for discharge immediately
after entry of the ship. The United States Treasury having
given permission for goods to emain forty-eight hours on
wharf at New York, any goods so left by consignee will be
at his or their risk of fire, loss, or injury."
Some criticism is made upon the words "so left by consignee," libellants insisting that the word "left" implies a
voluntary leaving of the cargo upon the wharf after notice
of the discharge of the same has been received by the consignee. We are not inclined, however, to affix to it such
a technical meaning. In view of the fact that the object of
the stipulation was evidently to exempt the carrier from
responsibility for fire occurring at any time after the discharge of the cargo, and particularly during the forty-eight
hours they were permitted to remain upon the wharf, which
forty-eight hours, under the terms of the permit, began to
run from the time of the general order to unload was granted,
we think it clear that it was intended to apply during this
time, whether the goods were technically "left" by the consignee or not, and that the proviso should be interpreted as if
-itread: "The United States Treasury having given permission for goods to remain forty-eight hours on wharf at New
York, any goods so remaining will be at consignee's risk of
fire, loss, or injury." This permission, though granted at the
request of the ship owner and primarily for his benefit, is
really of more value to the consignees, since a convenient
opportunity is there afforded them to examine their goods, and
they are saved the expense of cartage to a bonded warehouse
and storage therein.
The question presented then is substantially this: A and B
agree that in a certain contingency A shall assume the risk of
the loss of his goods by fire. Subsequently B agrees with C

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Opinion of the Court.

that, in precisely the same contingency, he shall be responsible
to A for the loss of the same goods. Waiving the question
whether this means any more than that he shall be responsible
so far as 0 is concerned, does the latter contract supersede
the earlier? Unquestionably it would, if it were between the
same parties. In this case, however, the first contract was
made by B (the respondent) in full contemplation of the fact
that it would be obliged to enter into the second, and for the
special purpose of providing against it. Now, to say that,
having entered into the first contract, knowing that it would
have to enter into a second one wholly inconsistent with the
first and intending to be bound by it, is scarcely creditable to
the intelligence of its agent. Libellants, too, though parties,
or rather privies to the first contract, were not parties to the
second, and so far as it appears did not even know that it was
or would be entered into, except as they may have known a
general usage to protect officers in this manner. The position
of the parties had not changed in the interval; no new consideration moved- from the libellants; and while the contract
was nominally made for their benofit, this gift of the collector
was purely a voluntary one. Indeed, the contract seems
really to have been for the protection of the collector himself.
Under these circumstances it is clearly the duty of this court
to harmonize these contracts, if it be possible to do so. It is
by no means a universal rule that a person may sue upon a
contract made for his benefit, to which he was not a party.
Hendrick v. Lindsay, 93 U. S. 143 ; National Bank v. Grand
Lodge, 98 U. S. 123; Zeller v. Ashford, 133 U. S. 610; Cragin
v. Lovell, 109 U. S. 194 ; Willardv. Wood, 135 U. S. 309. No
case has gone so far as to hold that, where the person for
whose benefit the contract is made, has himself or by his privy
in estate entered into a contract inconsistent with this, he may
repudiate such prior contract, and claim the benefit of the
second simply because it has become for his interest to do so.
We know of no principle which authorizes one party to an
agreement to vary it, even against his own interest, without
the consent of the other. As observed by the Court of Appeals
of New York, in Simpson v. Brown, 68 N. Y. 355: "It is not

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

every promise made by one to another, from the performance
of which a benefit may inure to a third, which gives a right
of action to such third person, he being neither privy to the
contract nor to the consideration. The contract must be made
for his benefit as its object and he must be the party intended
to be benefited." See also 7fational Bank v. Grand Lodge,
98 U. S. 123; Garnsey v. ]?ogers, 47 N. Y. 233.
The principle above announced was still further limited by
the Court of Appeals in Vrooman v. Turner, 69 N. Y. 280, in
which it was said that, to give a third party, who may derive
a benefit from the performance of a promise an action, there
must b&-frst, an intent by the promisor to secure some
benefit to the third party; and, second, some privity between
the two, the promisor and the party to be benetited, and some
obligation or duty owing from the promisor to the latter,
which would give him a legal or equitable claim to the benefit
of the promise, or an equivalent to him personally.
It is necessary to a correct understanding of this contract to
examine somewhat in detail the circumstances under which it
was entered into, and the authority under which the collector
acted in prescribing its terms. By Revised Statutes, sections
2867 and 2869, general authority is given to the collector to
authorize the unloading of vessels arriving within the limits
of their collection districts, and to grant a permit to land the
merchandise. By section 2966 the collector is authorized to
take possession of such merchandise, and deposit the same in
bonded warehouses, and by section 2969 all merchandise of
which the collector shall take possession under these provisions
shall be kept with due and reasonable care at the charge and
risk of the owner. By section 2871 the collector, "upon or
after the issuing of a general order," (fcr the unloading of the
cargo,) "shall grant, upon proper application therefor, a special
license to unlade the cargo of said vessel at night, that is to
say, between sunset and sunrise," upon a bond of indemnity
being given, etc., "and any liability of the master or owner of
any such steamship to the owner or consignee of any merchandise landed from her shall not be affected by the granting of
such special license or of any general order, but such liability

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Opinion of the Court.

shall continue until the merchandise is properly removed from
the dock- whereon the same may be landed." There is certainly nothing here which contemplates that the owner of the
vessel shall enter into any independent obligation, assuming
new liabilities or expanding in any way existing liabilities, to
the consignee. The object of the statute is clearly to preserve
the 8tatu8 quo; to continue such liability as already exists and
to preclude the ship owner from claiming that, by the action
of the collector, his liability to the owner of the merchandise
is impaired or restricted. In the language of the statute, any
previous liability "shall not be •ffected," "but such liability
shall continue until the merchandise isproperly removed from
the dock whereon the same may be landed." It is true that
no mention is here made of the power of the collector to allow
the unpermitted cargo to remain forty-eight hours upon the
wharf, and no such- power is expressly given; but by section
2989 "the Secretary of the Treasury may from time to time
establish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent 'with law,

for the due execution of tb ' provisions of this chapter, and to
secure a just accountability under the same as he may deem to
be expedient and necessary." While there is nothing in the
statute allowing any fixed time to elapse between the unlading
of the goods and their removal to a bonded warehouse, the
statute does not prohibit such time being allowed, and as some
interval must necessarily elapse for the examination and appraisement of the goods designed for immediate delivery to
the importer- duties which can most readily be performed
while the goods are yet upon the wharf - and as it is for the
mutual benefit of the government and consignee to allow some
such interval of time to elapse, the Secretary of the Treasury
is doubtless vested with a certain discretion in that particular,
under the power given him by section 2989, and also by section
251, which authorizes him to make rules and regulations not
inconsistent with law in carrying out the provisions of law
relating to raising revenue from imports.
In pursuance of this authority the Secretary of-the Treasury,
on May 5, 1877, adopted certain regulations concerning the
discharge of steamships, of which the following only is mate-

OCTOBER' TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

rial: ",
Goods will be delivered from the docks by the inspector
as fast as permits therefor are presented, and such as are discharged for which no delivery permit has been received will
be sent to the general-order store. The collector may, at the
request of the master, agent, or owner of the vessel, allow
goods landed but not ' permitted' to remain on the docks, at
the sole risk of the owner of the vessel, not longer than fortyeight hours from -the time of their discharge, upon the production of evidence that the owner of the vessel assumes the
risk of the goods allowed to remain and agrees to pay the
duties on any goods which may be lost by so remaining. This
request must be made in writing to the collector, and must
state that if the permission is granted the goods will be at the
risk of the owner of the vessel; that he will pay all duties on
goods that may be lost, and must be signed by the owner of
the vessel or his agent duly authorized. The consent of the
collector thereto must also be granted in writing. At the
expiration of the forty-eight hours, no permit having been
received for their delivery by the inspector, the collector shall
send the goods to 'he general-order store to have the same
weighed or gauged, if required."
In this connection it must be borne in mind that the Secretary of the Treasury is an officer of the government; that his
powers are limited by law; that his duty is to protect the
revenues of' the government and to prevent smuggling or
other' illegal practices, whereby the government may be
defrauded of its revenue; and that he owes no duty to individuals beyond seeing that their rights are not prejudiced any
further than is necessary by the action of the customs officers.
He is neither the agent of the vessel nor of the importe, but
stands between them, representing only the government and
charged only with the collection of its revenue. The above
regulation, when carefully examined, is consistent with this
view. It requires the collector to allow the goods to remain
upon the docks "at the sole risk of the owner of the vessel,"
and requires the latter to assume "1the risk of the goods allowed to remain," and to agree "to pay the duty on any
goods which may be lost by so remaining." It is obvious

CONSTABLE 1). NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Opinion of the Courb.

from the context. that the risk referred to is the risk as between the owner of the vessel and the government, viz., the
risk of paying duties upon such goods as may be lost during
the forty-eight hours. The permit is granted primarily for
the benefit and at the request of the vessel, which retains its
lien for freight for the goods so long as they remain on the
dock. The government has as yet. no claim for duties against
the consignee of the goods, and it is just that the owner of the
vessel should assume the liability for duties. There is nothing
here indicating an intention of imposing any liability upon the
ship owner for the goods themselves, except so far as to protect the government from loss. The loss referred to is probably a loss by theft, to which these warehouses are peculiarly
subject, since, if the goods were destroyed by fire, the consignee would, under section 2984, be entitled to an abatement
or refund of duties. This construction of the ship owner's
obligation is rather emphasized than otherwise by the subsequent clause of the regulation: "This request must be made
in writing to the collector, and must state that if the permission is granted the goods will be at the risk of the owner of
the vessel; that he will pay all duties on goods which may be
lost," ptc. The risk he thus assumes is the risk of paying the
duties upon goods which may be lost. There is nothing in
these. instructions, interpreted in the light of the statute and
of the powers of the collector, to justify the inference that it
was intended to impose any new or different obligation upon
the owner of the vessel, with respect to the consignees of the
merchandise.
In the forms prescribed, probably by the department, to
carry out these regulations, however, there is an apparent
departure both from the language of the statute and the
Treasury regulations, in the obligation the owner of the vessel is required to assume, "to pay to the consignee or owner
the value of such cargo respectively as may be stolen, buwned,
or otherwise lost, and also pay all duties on cargo which may
be in any way lost by so remaining." Here the obligation
to indemnify the consignee first appears and occupies the most
prominent place, and is extended to goods stolen, burned, or

otherwise lost, while the obligation to pay duties is mentioned
rather incidentally than otherwise. Wherever, or by whomsoever these forms were prepared, we must, for the purposes
of this case, treat them as the act of the collector, who, if this
contract be construed as intended for the protection of any
one but the collector himself, clearly exceeded his authority
in requiring the owner of the vessel to assume, as against the
consignee, the risk of their being burned while upon the wharf.
As the Circuit Court finds that "such application was in the
form required by said collector, without which permit would
not be granted, and the entire cargo would be sent to the
public store,' it cannot be treated as the voluntay act of the
ship owner any further than this -contract or obfigation conformed to the requirements of the statute or the Treasury
regulations, which were designed, as we have already stated,
only to preserve the previous rights of the consignee against
the owner of the steamship unimpaired by the action of the
collector. Beyond this it must be treated either as obtained
by duress, or so plainly inconsistent with the previous agreement of the parties inter sese as to be of no avail to the
consignee.
It is a familiar doctrine in this court that a bond or other
obligation extorted by a public officer, under color of his
office, cannot be enforced, and the remarks of this court in
the case of United States v. Tingej, 5 Pet. 115, 129, are pertinent in this connection. In this case the Navy Department
caused a form of bond, not prescribed by law, to be prepared
*and transmitted to one D.eblois, a person to whom" the disbursement of public moneys was entrusted as purser, to secure
fidelity in his official duties, with a condition that it should
be executed by him with sufficient sureties before he should
be permitted to remain in office, or to receive the pay or
emoluments attached to the office. "The substance of this
plea," said the court, "is, that the bond, with the above condition, variant from that prescribed by law, was, qnder color
of office, extorted from Deblois and his sureties, contrary to
the statute, by the then Secretary of the Navy, as the condition of his remwining in the office of purser, and receiving its

Opinion of the Court.

emoluments. There is no pretence then to say, that it was
a bond voluntarily given, or that, though .different from the
form prescribed by statute, it was received and executed without objection. It was demanded of the party, upon the peril
of losing his office; it was extorted under color of office,
against the requisitions of the statute. It was plainly then
an illegal bond; for no officer of the government has a right,
by color of his office, to require from any subordinate officer,
as a condition of holding offic? , that he should execute a bond
with a condition different from that prescribed by law. That
would be, not to execute, but to supersede the requisitions of
law."
A distinction is drawn in this class of cases between a bond
compulsorily executed, as in the case under consideration, and
a bond or other obligation voluntarily given to the government for which there. is no statutory authority. In this latter case the bond has been held to be valid. United States v.
Bradley, 10 Pet. 343, 358; United States v. Hodson, 10 Wall.
395.
Upon the whole case we are of opinion:
1. That the stipulation in the bill of lading that respondent
should not be liable for a fire happening after unloading the
cargo was reasonable and valid.
2. That the discharge of the cargo at the Inman pier was
not in the eye of the law a deviation such as to render the
carrier an insurer of the goods so unladen.
3. That if any notice of such unloading was required at
all, the bulletin posted in ihe custom-house was sufficient
under the practice and usages of the port of New York.
4. That libellants, having taken no steps upon the faith of
the cargo being unladen at respondent's pier, were not prejudiced by the change.
5. That the agreement of the respondent with the'collector
of customs to pay the consignees the value of the goods was
not one' of which the libellants could avail themselves as adding to the obligations of their contract with respondent.
The decree of the Circuit Court is therefore
Affirmed.

I dissent from the judgment and opinion of the court in
this case.
The liability of the respondent is not relieved by the provisions of section 4282 of the Revised Statutes, reenacting the
first section of the act of Congress of March 3, 1851, as the
fire by which the goods were destroyed did not happen "to
or on board the vessel." 3forewood v. Pollok, 1 El. & B1.
743 ; Salmon FallsJ fg. Co. v. Bark Tangier, 21 Law Reporter,
6. Nor is the question of the carrier's liability for loss of the
goods controlled by any supposed policy of that enactment.
The National Steamship Company, by the contract of
affreightment embodied in the bill of lading, undertook not
merely to carry, but to deNver the thirty-six cases of merchandise in question at the port of New York unto the libellants
in like go6d order and condition as received, subject to certain exceptions and conditions, designed to lessen or limit its
liability and modify its duty as a common carrier.
The goods were not delivered, either actually or constructively, to the consignees, but were destroyed by fire while
still in the custody and possession of the steamship company
as carrier, after being landed and deposited on the Inman
pier, No. 36, under a special order or permit which the steamship company .applied for and obtained from the collector of
the port, allowing the goods to remain upon the wharf for
forty-eight hours from the time of granting the general order
to discharge..
The steamship company, as a common carrier, is, upon.wellsettled principles, responsible for this loss, unless it is relieved
from liability by some special exception or express stipulation
in the bill of lading, or by reason of some established or
known usage at the port of New York.
The conditions and provisions contained in the bill of lading,
so far as the same are material to the present controversy, are
as follows :
1. "Fire before loading in the ship, or after unloading."

CONSTABLE v, NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

2. "The National Steamship Company, or its agents, or afiy
of its servants are not to be liable for any damage to any
goods which is capable of being covered by insurance."
3. "The goods to be taken from alongside by the consignee
immediately the -vessel is ready to, discharge, or otherwise
they will be landed by the master and deposited at the expense of the consignee and at his risk of fire, loss, or injury,
in the warehouse provided for that purpose or in the public store, as the collector of the port of New York shall direct,
and when deposited in the warehouse or store to be subject
to storage, the collector of the port being hereby authorized
to grant a general order for discharge immediately after
entry of- the ship."
4. "The United States Tteasury having given permission
for goods to remain forty-eight hours on wharf at New York,
any goods so left by consignee will be at his or their risk of
fire, loss, or injury."
These provisions of the affreightment contract, modifyirig
and qualifying the carrier's common law liability, must, in
accordance with the well-settled rule, be construed strictly.
Their meaning is not to be extended by presumption so as to
give the carrier protection beyond what has been stipulated
for in clear and unmistakable terms. In so far as they are
ambiguous or leave the intention of the parties in doubt, they
are to be construed against the steamship company. Edsall
v. Camden and Amboy Railroad, 50 N. Y. 661; Taylor v.
L.iver1ool & Gt. Western Steam Co., L. R. 9 Q. B. 546; Bishop
on Contradts, 411 ; Carver on Carriers, § 77.
Now, subjecting the terms and stipulations of the bill of.
lading to the-test of -this established rule of construction, did
they clearly and expressly confer upon the steamship company
the right to discharge and deposit the goods upon the Inman
wharf at the risk of the consignees, without previous 4otice
to them, or any knowledge on -their part, as to when and
where the steamer would be docked and its cargo landed?
It is settled by the authorities that it is the duty of the carrier, unless specially relieved from so doing by the, contract of
affreightment, to give due and reasonable notice to the conVOL. cLIV-

signee of the time and place of discharging the goods, and to
properly separate the different consignments, so as to afford
the consignee a fair opportunity to remove the goods, or to put
them under proper care and custody.
In V7the Eddy, 5 Wall. 481,, 495, the general rule is thus
stated by this court: "Delivery on the wharf, in the case of
goods transported by ships, is sufficient under our law, if due
notice be given to the consignees and the different consignments be properly separated so as to be open to inspection and
conveniently accessible to their respective owners. Where the
contract is to carry by water from port to port, an actual delivery of the goods into the possession of the owner or consignee, or at his warehouse, is not required in order to discharge
the carrier from his liability. He may deliver them on the
wharf; but to constitute a valid delivery there the master
should give due and reasonable notice to the consignee, so as
to afford him a fair opportunity to remove the goods or put
them under proper care and custody. When the goods, after
being sf discharged and the different consignments properly
separated, are not accepted by the consignee or owner of the
cargo, the carrier sh6uld not leave them exposed on the wharf,
but should store them in a place of safety, notifying the consignee or owner that they axe so stored, subject to the lien of
the ship for the freight and charges, and when he has done so
he is no longer liable on his contract of affreightment." This
statement of the law is reaffirmed in EparteEaston,95 U. S.
68, 75, and is fully supported by the authorities both in this
country and in England.
Thus in AleAndrew v. Whitlock, 52 N. Y. 40, it was held
that a carrier of goods, by water, may land them at a wharf
at the port of destination, but not until after he has given the
consignee due notice of their arrival and unlading, and afforded him a reasonable time to take charge of and secure
them. In the meantime, instead of leaving them on the
wharf, it is his duty to take care of them for the owners. See
also to the same effect Zinn v. N. J. Steamboat Co., 49 N. Y.
442; 17e Mary Waskington, Chase, 125 ; The San tee, 'TBlatchford, 186; IEohn v. Pockard,3 La. 224; The Tybee, 1 Woods,

358, 361 ; Angell on Carriers, § 310, and Redfield on Carriers,

129.
In the present case, as shown by the seventeenth and eighteenth findings of fact, the carrier did not comply with the
requirement of the law in giving notice of the time and place
the steamer would .discharge her cargo, nor did the consignees
have any knowledge either of the vessePs readiness to discharge or that their merchandise would be or had been landed
and deposited upon the Inman dock; and the question is whether
the special conditions and stipulations of the bill of lading
were intended to dispense with such notice, or can be reasonably construed to mean that the carrier was authorized to
deposit the goods on the wharf at the risk of the consignees
without giving them previous notice, and a reasonable opportunity to take charge of the same.
The only clauses of the bill of lading bearing upon this question are the first, third, and fourth, as above quoted.
The exemption from liability for loss by "fire after"unloading," does not, by its terms, confer any authority to deposit
the goods upon the wharf without notice to and at the risk
of the consignees. The words, "fire after unloading," must
receive a reasonable construction. They manifestly do not
confer upon the carrier an unqualified discretion as to when
and where the cargo may be unloaded. The steamship company could not, for instance, under that provision of the bill
of lading, have discharged the goods of the consignee at
Brooklyn or Jersey City, and claimed exemption from liability
in the event of their destruction by fire while so landed. The
clause clearly contemplates, and should be confined to, a lawful unloading, made in the proper execution of the contract to
deliver -such an unloading as will conform to the law or
usage of the port of destination, or to the special contract of
the parties. The generality of its language in this case is to
be restricted and interpreted by the subsequent and moreparticular provision found in the third of the above clauses,
directing the disposition to be made of the goods, if the same
are not taken from alongside of the vessel when it is ready to
discharge. These clauses do not operate to limit the carrier's

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.

duty and obligation as prescribed by law, beyond what is
clearly expressed in the terms thereof, or may be fairly implied
therefrom. They do not, either singly or collectively, relieve
the carrier from its duty to notify the consignees of the time
and place of discharging the merchandise; nor do they
authorize the carrier to deposit the goods on the wharf at the
risk of the consignees without such notice.
In The Santee, 7 Blatchford, 186, the bill of lading contained
the special clause that the articles named therein should be at
the risk of the consignee or owner thereof, as soon as delivered
from the tackles of the steamer at her port of destination, and
that they should be received by the consignee, package by
package, as so delivered. If not taken away the same day
they might be sent to a store or permitted to lie where landed,
at the expense and risk of the owner or consignee. It was
held by the court that, notwi thstanding such special contract,
it was the duty of the carrier to give reasonable notice to the
consignees of the arrival and discharge of the vessel, so as to
enable them to attend and receive the goods, and themselves
assume and exercise that care and responsibility of which the
carrier was to be relieved. Tlhe same rule is laid down in
Collins v. Burns, 63 N. Y. 1; Tarbell v. Royal Exchange
Shipping Co., 1.10 N. Y. 170; and Wheeler on Carriers, 333.
In Tarbellv. Royal Exchange Shipping Co., 110 N. Y. 170,180,
the bill of lading on merchandise from a foreign port contained
the provision that the goods were to be delivered from the
ship's deck (when the ship owner's responsibility should
cease) at the port of New York, and "were to be received by
the consignees immediately the vessel is ready to discharge,
or otherwise they will be landed and stored, at the sole
expense and risk of the consignees, in the warehouses provided
for that purpose, or in the public store, as the collector of the
port of New York shall direct." The Court of Appeals of
New York held that the carrier must, if practicable, give
notice to the consignee of the arrival of the goods, and that
when this had been done, and the goods had been discharged
in the usual and proper place, and reasonable opportunity
afforded to the consignee to remove them, the liability of the

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

carrier as such would terihinate, and, in respect to the clauses
in question, the court said: "IT-he general duty of a carrier
to deliver, and of a consignee to receive, as defined in the
authorities to which we have referred, is not, we think, essentially changed by the clause in the bill of lading that the
goods are to be delivered from the ship's deck, (when the ship
owner's responsibility shall cease,) or by the clause that the
goods are to be received by the consignee 'immediately the
vtssel is ready to discharge.'"
The position taken in the opinion of the court that the
clauses in the bill of lading under consideration are inconsistent with the idea of personal notice to the consignees, is not
supported by the authorities, but is in direct conflict therewith.
The case of Gleadell v. Thornso, 56 N. Y. 194, cited in the
opinion, is, when analyzed, essentially different from the case
at bar. In that case the bill of lading contained the provision that the goods should be taken from alongside -by the
consignees "immediately the vessel is ready to discharge, or
otherwise the privilege is reserved to the vessel to land them
on the pier, or put them into craft, or deposit them in the
warehouse designated by the collector of the port of New
York, all at the expense of the consignee, and at his risk of
fire, loss, or injury." It was held by the court that it was
not incumbent on the carrier to give notice of readiness to
discharge the goods as a condition of his exercising the
privilege of depositing them upon the pier, and that while so
deposited they were, by the terms of the contract, at the
consignee's risk of fire, loss, or injury.
This decision means nothing more than that under the
alternative privilege reserved to the vessel the carrier had the
right to land the goods on the pier at the consignees' expense
and risk of fire, loss, or injury, without giving the consignees
previous notice or opportunity to- take the goods from alongside the ship. The bill of lading in the case at bar contains
no stipulation reserving to the, vessel the privilege of landing
the goods on the pier at the expense and risk of the consignees,
as in Gleadell v. Thomson. The provision of the bill of lading
in the present case is that the goods are to be taken from

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

alongside by the consignees "immediately the vessel is ready
to discharge, or otherwise they will be landed by the master
and deposited at the expense of the consignees, and at their
risk of fire, loss, or injury, in the warehouseprovidedfor that
purpose or in the public store, as the collector of the port of
New York shall direct," and when deposited in the warehouse
or store to be subject to storage.
If the rule laid down in Gleadell v. Thomson is sound and

applicable to the case under consideration, then, upon its
failure or neglect to give the consignees notice of the time
and place of discharging the cargo so as to enable them to
take their goods from alongside the vessel, the steamship
company was bound to land and deposit the goods in the
warehouse provided for that purpose or in a public store, as
the collector of the port of New York might direct. If it
failed to give the consignees proper notice and opportunity
to take the goods from alongside when the vessel was ready
to discharge, then the alternative obligation, by the express
terms of the contract, was that the master of the steamer
should land and deposit the goods in a warehouse or public
store as the collector might direct. No right whatever was
reserved in this stipulation to deposit the merchandise upon
the pier at the risk of the consignees. On the contrary, the
express undertaking on the part of the carrier, by this provision of the contract, was that if the goods were not taken
from alongside, the master should land and deposit them in
one or the other of the designated places.
The duty on the part of the consignees to take the goods
from alongside the vessel necessarily depended upon their
having notice of the time and place, when and where, the
vessel would discharge her cargo, and be ready to make delivery. When, therefore, the carrier proceeded with the discharge without giving such notice, the alternative stipulation
of the contract, as well as its legal obligation under the law,
required that the goods should be "landed and deposited "
in the manner specified; and the fact that the place for depositing the consignment was specially designated and provided for in event it was not taken from alongside the vessel,

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEA3tSIIIP' CO.

87

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

clearly negatives the right of the carrier to deposit it on the
wharf at the risk of the consignees. If the steamship company had, without notice to the consignees, landed and deposited the goods in a bonded warehouse, or, as directed by
the general order of the collector, in public store 502-510
Washington Street, then the case would have come within
the rule laid down in Gleadell v. Thomson.
There is no finding of fact in this case, supporting the suggestiQn that the 11warehouse," referred to in the third of the
above quoted clauses of the bill of lading, was the covered
pier or wharf oA which the goods were landed. The word
"warehouse," wherever used in the bill of lading, is coupled
with the words "1public store," and it is plainly evident that
they have the same meaning. That these words are synonymous, and that " warehouse," when used alone, means a
"bonded warehouse" clearly appears in the sections of the
Revised Statutes relating to the collection of customs duties.
Sections 2954, et seq. That no different meaning is given to
the wbrd " warehouse," when used in connection with the
customs laws, further appears from the definition given it in
the standard dictionaries.
It appears by the sixteenth finding of fact that the respondent on the afternoon of January 31, 1883, soon after the
entry of the vessel, caused a notice of the time and place of
discharge to be posted on a bulletin board in the customhouse; that it was usual to post such notice there, but that
it was not usual to publish it in the newspapers; and the
conclusion reached by this court is "that if any notice of such
unloading was required at all, the bulletin posted in the
custom-house was sufficient under the practice and usage of
the port of New York."
This conclusion of the court cannot, for several reasons, be
sustained. There is no finding of the court below of any
practice or usage at the port of New York dispensing with
personal notice to the consignees, nor that notice posted at
the custom-house would, by any well-established or known.
usage, charge or affect the consignees with notice. The
authorities clearly establish that notice, such as that posted

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

.upon the bulletin board, must be shown to have come to
the actual knowledge of the consignees in order to bind them,
or relieve the carrier from the duty of giving personal
notice.
In T2he .XAiddesx, 21 Law Rep. 14, 15; S. 0. Brunner, 605,
606, it was said by Curtis, X.: "Mere knowledge that the
vessel has arrived and is discharging, at a particular wharf,
gained in some casual manner by the consignee, without any
act on the part of the ma~ter, to indicate a readiness to deliver, is not within the usage, which is for the master, or
some agent for the vessel, to give notice to the consignees:
And I do not think such casual knowledge is sufficient to
impose on the consignee the duty of attending to the discharge of the vessel, and being in readiness to receive his
It
goods as soon as they are ready for delivery. . .
must be remembered that it is not knowledge of the arrival
of the vessel and that she is discharging, but notice of the
readiness of the master to deliver, -which is the operative
fact."
In Kohn v. Packard,3 La. 224, 229, the question whether
notice of the arrival of a vessel published in the newspapers
was binding upon the consignees, was clearly and convincingly
treated by ?orter, J., who said: "If we understand correctly
the usage as proved in evidence, it is this: that notice in the
newspapers of the time and place of the landing goods from
a vessel, is such notice as places the goods at the risk of the
consignee. In other words, that constructive notice binds the
party as effectually as personal notice would. If this be
the custom, then it is one which this court is prepared to say
it cannot sanction. Authorities have been read to show that
the goods are to be delivered according to the usage of the
port to which they are shipped. The principle may be admitted without at all affecting the conclusion to which we
have come, for though the custom may regulate the delivery,
it cannot dispense with it. Such would be the effect, however,
of the usage relied on in numerous instances. We understand
that it is of the essence of the contract of affreightment that
there be an engagement to deliver the goods to the consignee.
.

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEAMSHIP 00.

He consequently must be informed of the time and place the
delivery is to be made, to enable him to receive them, and if
he has not that information, the other party to the contract
cannot dissolve it. Yet the custom relied on assumes that he
may; for if notice in the newspapers is to bind the consignee
of the goods, though he never hears of it or sees it, and if
such notice confers on the master of the Vessel the right to
land the goods on the levee, where they- are destroyed or
stolen, then it follows that the custom dispenses with delivery,
or anything equivalent to it. This we think custom cannot
do. There must be the act of both parties to terminate the
contract, or the default of one of them to authorize the other
to do so."
In Parsons on Shipping, vol. 1, p. 224, it is laid down as a
general proposition that "in all cases the master is required
to give notice to the consignee of the arrival of the vessel,
and of- his readiness to discharge the cargo, and knowledge,
therefore, acquired that the vessel has arrived and will discharge her cargo at a particular wharf, is not enough. Generally if a notice in the newspapers is relied on, it must be
shown that the consignee read the notice." This same rule is
approved in Leggett on Bills of Lading, p. 279.
'There is not only no finding by the court below that the
deposit of the goods on the Inman pier, No. 36, without
previous notice to the consignees, was in accordance with any
general usage of the port of New York, but, on the contrary,
the court found a state of facts which established a course f
dealing between the parties inconsistent with any such usage.
Thus, by the nineteenth finding, it appears that during the
five years preceding the consignment in question the libellants
had received six consignments of merchandise -in steamships
belonging to the respondent, under bills of lading substantially
in the same form as the bill of lading herein, all of which
were landed and discharged on pier No. 39; that during the
same period the freight bills for these six consignments were
sent to the libellants, each containing a reference to that pier,
and that pier only, as the pier of the respondent company
where the goods would be found upon their arrival and dis-

charge; that this was true of the consignment to the libellants
in this case, the freight bill of which was the same in form as
the preceding six, and which was not received by the libellants
until February 1, 1883, the day after the goods had been
destroyed by fire.
It was further found by the court below:
"(20) That during the said five years preceding the time
of the arrival of the steamship Egypt in this case, that being
the period during which the libellants had been receiving
goods'by the respondent's line from time to time as aforesaid,
there have been two hundred and forty-one arrivals of the
respondent's steamships at said port of New York coming
from said port of Liverpool, and in only eight instances does
.it appear that the said steamships or any of them discharged
at any dock other than that known as the National dock,
exclusively occupied and controlled by the respondent as
aforesaid, and no evidence was offered with reference to the
circumstances attending the discharge of said eight vessels.
As to forty-one of said steamships, evidence of the place of
their discharge was not produced.
"(22)" That prior to the arrival and discharge of said
steamship Egypt at said Inman dock as aforesaid no steamship belonging to the respondent from said port of Liverpool
or elsewhere had ever been discharged at said dock owned
and controlled by the Inman Steamship Company, Limited,
as aforesaid.
"(23) That said dock known as the National dock, being
pier N . 39, North River, in the city of New York, is and
was at the time of the arrival of the steamship Egypt as
aforesaid the usual and a proper place at said port of New
York for the discharge of cargoes coming from said port of
Liverpool in steamships belonging to the respondent company,
and is and was at such time a proper place at said port of
New York for the discharge of the said thirty-six packages
of merchandise belonging to the libellants, and destroyed as
aforbsaid.
"(24) That said dock known as the National dock, being
said pier No. 39, North River, in the city of INew York, was

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.

91

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

the dock and place ordinarily and generally, but not invariably,
used at said port of New York for the discharge of cargoes
coming from said port of Liverpool in steamships belonging
to the respondent company.
"(25) That the National dock, being pier No. 39, North
River, in said city of New York, is and was at the time of
the discharge of the steamship Egypt as aforesaid, the dock
or wharf to which consignees of cargo coming from said port
of Liverpool to said port of New York in steamships belonging to the respondent company would naturally and usually
go for the purpose of caring for and receiving a delivery of
their consignments."
It is also admitted in the amended answer of the respondent that "there is nothing in the bills of lading which led
the libellants to believe that the goods in said bills of lading
were not to be landed on said National dock, (No. 39,) and
there delivered" to the libellants.
It is not set up or claimed in the answer of the respondent
that in discharging and depositing the goods, without notice
to the consignees, at a different pier from that at which it
was in the habit of landing and delivering other consignments to the libellants, the carrier was acting in pursuance
of any established custom or usage of the port of New York.
No such justification is set up; on the contrary, the answer
alleges that the consignees had due and proper notice that
the goods would be landed or discharged at pier No. 36.
It denied the libellants' allegation that they did not have
notice that the goods were not to be landed and delivered
at the National dock, No. 39, and averred that the libellants
did have notice that the goods carried by the Egypt were to
be landed at pier No. 36, at which they were actually landed.
The seventeenth finding of fact contradicts this denial and
averment of the answer.
The carrier having landed and deposited the goods, not at
its usual and customary place of discharge, where the consignees would naturally expect to receive their consignment,
as they had always previously done, and there being an
implied undertaking on the part of the carriers to discharge

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

at the usual wharf according to the established course of dealing between the parties, the duty of giving notice that the
discharge and delivery of the goods would be made at another
and different place became the more imperative upon the
carrier.
In Story on Bailments, § 545, it is said: "In America the
rule adopted in regard to foreign voyages, although it has
been matter of some controversy, seems to be that in such
cases the carrier is not bound to make a personal delivery of
the goods to the consignee, but it will be sufficient that he
lands them at the usual wha or proper place of landing,
and gives due and. reasonable notice thereof to the consignee.. . .. . But it is of the very essence of the rule that
due and reasonable notice should be given to the consignee
before or at the time of the landing, and that he should have
a fair opportunity of providing suitable means to take care of
the goods and to carry them away."
So, in Addison on Contracts, § 961 : "If it is customary for
the carrier by Water to carry merely rom port to poA, or from
wharf to wharf, and for the owner or consignee to fetch .the
goods from the vessel itself, or from the wharf, as soon as
the arrival of the ship has been reported, the carrier -must
'give such owner or consignee notice of the arrival of the
goods on board, or at the customary place of destination, in
-order to discharge himself from further liability as a carrier.
He cannot at once discharge himself from further liability by
immediately landing the goods without any notice to the consignee, but is bound to keep the goods on board or on the
wharf, at his own risk, for a reasonable time, to enable the
consignee .or his assigns to come and fetch them."
The rule thus laid down is supported by Salnon Falls Mfg.
Co. v. Bark Tangier, 21 Law Rep. 6; Gibson v. Culver, 1
Wend. 305; 2 Kent, 604; Maclachlan on Merchant Shipping, (4th ed.,) 453, 454; Hyde v. Trent &¢ Mersey Navigation Co., 5 T. R. 389; Gatlife v. Bourne, 4 Bing. N. C. 314.
In Gatliffe v. Bourne, to a declaration on a contract by a
inaster of a steam vessel to convey goods from Dublin to
London, and to deliver the same at the port of London to the

CONSTABLE v. NATIdNAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

plaintiff or his assigns, a plea was filed to the effect that after
the arrival of the vessel at London defendant caused the
goods to be unshipped and safely and securely landed and
deposited in and upon a certain wharf, called Fenning's
wharf, at the port of London, there to remain until they
could be delivered to the plaintiff, said wharf being a place
where goods from Dublin were customarily landed and deposited for the use of consignees, and a place fit and proper
for such purposes; that while the goods were thus deposited
upon said wharf and before a reasonable time for delivery
had elapsed, they were destroyed by an accidental fire. This
plea was held to be bad, and the carrier was charged with the
loss of the goods accidently burned while deposited on the.
wharf. This decision was affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber, Bourne v. GatliWfe, 3 Man. & Gr. 643, and in the House
of Lords, Bourne v. Gatlife, 11 C1. & Fin. 45; S. C. -7Man.
& Gr. 850, and . . 8 Scott, (N. R.,) 604. In the report of
the case before the House of Lords it is stated that no notice
was given to the plaintiff that the goods were landed upon
the wharf.
This case, in principle, controls the present case, unless the
special clauses of the bill of lading authorize the deposit of
the goods upon the Inman wharf without notice to the consignees and at their risk. The provisions of the bill of lading
already considered do not confer such authority, and if it
exists it must be found in the remaining clause, viz.: "The
United States Treasury having given permission for goods to
remain forty-eight hours on wharf at New York, any goods
so left &y consignee will be at his or their risk of fire, loss,
or injury."
This is the only clause in the bill of lading which in any
way refers to a deposit of the goods upon the wharf. The
court in its opinion construes this language to mean "The
United States Treasury having given permission for goods to
remain forty-eight hours on wharf at New York, any goods so
remaining will be at the consignee's risk of fire, loss; or injury."
This construction not only gives no effect to the words "left
by the consignee," but substitutes the act of the master for

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

that of the counignee. It makes the master's act of depositing
a leaving by the consignees. The words "left by the con§ignee" clearly contemplate the voluntary leaving, not by the
master, but by the consignee, which could only occur after
'due notice that the goods were so deposited, and a reasonable
opportunity afforded for removinithem. The words import
a voluntary act of leaving on the part-of the consignee, that
is to say, the consignee must suffer or permit the goods to
remain, or omit to remove them after it has become his or
their duty so to do. The consignees' duty of positive and
affirmative action is not called into exercise until after they
have had notice that their goods will be or have been deposited
on the wharf. Until such notice and an opportunity to take
charge of the goods is given to the consignees, it is a perversion
of language to say that the goods are left by them.
Reading this clause in connection with the former, it clearly
appears that what the parties meant and provided for was
that if the consignees were not ready to receive their goods
immediately upon their discharge from the vessel, the master
was to deposit them, not on the dock or wharf, but in the
warehouse or publlc store at the expense and risk of the consignees; but that if the carrier availed itself of the Treasury
regulations to deposit the goods on the wharf under the fortyeight hour clause, the consignees' risk and liability for loss,
while so deposited, would not commence until after they had
notice of such deposit and a reasonable opportunity to remove
the goods. It cannot be properly said that there was or could
be, on their part, any leaving of the goods so deposited until
the consignees -were put upon the duty of accepting delivery,
or taking charge of the consignment, which would not arise
until they had received notice.
This interpretation of the clause is sustained by the wellconsidered case of 7ffoa~inney v. Jewett, 90 1N. Y. 267, 270, 272,
where the contract provided that the carrier should not be
liable as, such, while the goods were "at any of their stations
.awaiting delivery."
But, conceding that the clause is ambiguous, the settled rules
of construction do not sanction a liberal interpretation thereof

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.

in favor of the carrier, but directly the reverse. Especially is
this so when, as in the present case, the steamship company
has, by its action in procuring the forty-eight hour permit,
itself placed a different*construction upon the clause. It is
well settled that the practical construction placed by parties
interested upon doubtful or ambiguous terms in a contract
will exercise great and sometimes controlling influence in.
determining its proper meaning. Topliff v. Yoplff, 122 U. S.
121; District of Columbia v. Gallaher, 124: U. S. 505.
The general order for discharge, obtained upon the entry of
the vessel, directed that' the cargo, except certain perishable
articles, gunpowder, neat cattle, etc., should be landed and
sent to public store 502-510 Washington Street. This general
order was not acted on. by the steamship. company, but as
shown by the eleventh finding of fact, after securing the general order the respondent obtained from the collector of the
port a, special license, under the provisions of section 281 of
the Revised Statutesj to unload at night, and gave bond to
indemnify and save the collector harmless from any loss or
liability which might occur, or be occasioned by reason of the
granting of that special license. The carrier furthermore
voluntarily applied to the collector and obtained a permit for
the goods to remain upon the wharf for forty-eight hours from
the time of granting the general order, at the risk of the
owners of the steamer, and upon the agreement that they
would pay to the consignees or owners the value of such cargo
respectively as might be, stolen, burned,, or otherwise lost
while so deposited.
The permit to unload at night was manifestly for the benefit and convenience of the carrier. The same is true in
respect to the permit for the goods to remain on the wharf
for forty-eight hours. The unloading commenced in the
afternoon of January 31, after business hours, and was continued through the night; and even if notice had been given
to the consignees, there was no reasonable. time and opportunity afforded them to remove or take charge of the goods
before they were destroyed by fire.
In the execution of its undertaking to deliver the goods to

OCTOBER TERM, .1893.

the consignees at the port of New York, the carrier had no
right to change or increase the risk by any departure from the
express stipulations of the contract. In unloading at night
for its own benefit, and in depositing. the goods upon the
wharf for its own convenience, the risk and liability of loss
was manifestly increased; and the goods having been destroyed while subjected, by the voluntary act of the carrier to
this increased risk, it is liable for the loss, unless expressly
exempted by some provision of the affreightment contract. It
must be borne in mind, as Lord Lyndhurst expressed it in Gat,fie v. Bourne, before the House of Lords, that the contract
was "to deliver the goods to the consignees" at the port of
destination. Instead of making, or attempting to make, such
delivery, either actually or constructively, the carrier, on a
permit from the collector, deposited the goods on the wharf,
thereby changing, if not increasing, the risk of loss, in a way
not provided for by any stipulation of the contract.
Again, it was found by the Circuit Court (12) "1That said
general order and special license and said applications and
permits and the agreements and engagements therein contained were the usual and customary ones ordinarily made
and granted in such cases, and that they were made and
granted under and by the authority in and by said bill of lading conferred upon the respondent and upon said collector of
the port of New York by the libellants herein, and under and
in accordance with the provisions of law in that behalf and
the regulations of the United States Treasury Department on
that subject." And further, (13) "That said applications
were made and said general order and special license and permits were obtained on behalf of the respondent under the
instructions and by direction of the respondent's agent in the
city of New York, and all of the agreements and engagements
made and entered into therein or thereby and on behalf of
the respondent or the libellants were made and entered into
under and pursuant to- the same instructions and directions of
said agent."
In the light of these findings the contract of the parties
should be interpreted as though the clause in question had

CONSTABLE. v. 2NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

read as follows: "The United States Treasury having given
permission for goods to remain forty-eight hours on the wharf
at New York, at the sole risk of the steamship company, and
upon its undertaking to pay to the consignee or owner the value
of such cargo respectively as may be stolen, burned, or otherwise lost while so remaining, now it is understood that if the
steamship company avails itself of this regulation, and obtains
permission for the consignment to remain on the wharf for
forty-eight hours upon said terms, its risk and liability for losses
shall only continue and remain in force until the consignee
has had due notice and opportunity to remove or take charge
of the goods; and if, thereafter, they are left by the consignee,
it will be at his risk of fire, loss, or injury." This harmonizes
all the clauses, and is alone consistent with the correlative
duties and obligations of the parties.
It is not material to the present case to determine whether
the regulations of the Treasury Department, set out in the
eleventh finding of the court below, have the force -of law,
and imposed upon the steamship company the duty of entering into the stipulation to pay the consignees for the loss of,
the goods deposited on the wharf under the forty-eight hour
permit. That stipulation was entered into voluntarily by the
steamship company. There was no requirement in the contract of affreightment that it should obtain *any such permit,
and it cannot be properly said that the stipulation which it
entered into in order to secure permission for the goods to
remain forty-eight hours on the wharf, was inconsistent with
any provision of the law or regulations of the Treasury
Department. No provision of the bill of lading exempted
the carrier from liability for loss by fire that might happen.
while the goods were deposited on the wharf under the fortyeight hour permit, and no reason appears why the carrier
might not expressly undertake a liability which the law
would otherwise impose upon it, until by proper, notice the
duty of taking care of the goods was shifted or transferred to
the consignees.
But, it is said, the consignees cannot avail themselves of
this promise made by the steamship company to the collector

because they are not privies thereto. This, however, ignores
the above findings of fact by the court, which make the consignees parties to the arrangement. Aside from this, while it
is undoubtedly the general rule that a,person who is not a
party to a simple contract, cannot enforce such contract at
law, and that a promise made by one person to another for
the benefit of a third, who is a stranger to the consideration,
will not support an action by.the latter, Nvational Bank v.
GrancZ Lodge, 98 U. S. 123, there are many exceptions to the
rule, one of which, according to the New York decisions, is
where, the party seeking to enforce the contract was intended
to be the beneficiary of the promise. Lawrence v. -Fox,20
N. Y. 268; Coster v. Albany, 43 N. Y. 399, 410, 412; Garn8ey v. Rogers, 47 N. Y. 233; fProoman v. Turner, 69 N. Y.
280..
The promise made by the steamship company in the present case falls directly within the rule announced in TFromnan
v. Turner, 69N. Y. 280, there being, first, a clear intent by
the promisor to secure a benefit to the consignees; second,
a privity between the two in respect to the protection of the
goods, the risk of which the carrier assumed; and, third, an
obligation or duty owing by the steamship company to the
consignees to properly care for the goods until delivery could
be made, which gave to the consignees a legal and equitable
claim to the benefit of the promise. The decisions in other
States are conflicting on this question.
But if an action at law would not lie upon the promise
made by the respondent in obtaining the forty-eight hour
permit, it by no means follows that the consignees could not
successfully invoke the aid of a court of equity in enforcing
the agreement. The legal rule invoked is not so rigidly or so
strictly adhered to by courts of equity as by courts of law.
Thus, in Zeller v. Ashford, 133 U. S. 610, 625, the mortgagee
was permitted to enforce in equity a contract between the*
mortgagor and his grantee, by the terms of which the
g antee assumed the payment of the mortgaged debt. See
also Willard v. TFood, 135 U. S. 309, 314; Norwood v. DeHart, 3 Stewart, (30 N. J. lEq.,) 412.

CONSTABLE v. NATIONAL STEAISHIP CO.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

Now the broad principles of equity are recognized and
applied by the admiralty courts, and the steamship company's
agreement being, as properly held by the court below, an
admiralty contract, and the consignees being the parties intended to be benefited thereby, and it being'one contemplated by the parties at the time of entering into the contract
of affreightment, no valid reason is seen why the consignees
should not have, by this libel, the right to enforce the stipulation, voluntarily entered into by the steamship company, which
agreement is not in conflict with any provision in the bill of
lading.
It is true that the court below found (twenty-seventh finding) that it was the intention of the parties to the bill of
lading that goods remaining for forty-eight hours on the
wharf, under the permit obtained on the application of the
steamship company, should be at the risk of the consignee
of fire, notwithstanding the agreement of the steamship company to assume such risk. This is not a good finding of fact,
but is a mere conclusion of law based upon the court's construction of the clauses of the contract, above referred to,
and is not binding upon this court.
The opinion .of'this 'court seems to proceed largely upon
the idea that the consignees, if they had received notice,
could not have removed the goods before they were destroyed; and, further,' that inasmuch as they took no steps
on the faith of the cargo being discharged at the usual place,
they were not prejudiced by the change. These are considerations that do not control or change the rights and liabilities
of the parties. The real question in cases like this is, whether
the carrier has brought itself within any exemption from
liability by showing that the loss was caused by the act of
God, or by the public enemy, or by the shipper, or was within
some excepted clause in the contract of affreightment. If
this is not shown, the carrier is liable for the loss. Clark v.
BarnweUl, 12. How. 272, 280.
While not controverting the legal principles governing the
liabilities and duties of carriers, the opinion of the court
seems to imply that to some extent they should be modified

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.

or suspended to meet the improved moderi methods of rapid
transportation. But I submit that long established legal principles, founded upon a wise public policy, are not to be either
ignored or disregarded to meet a supposed public convenience,
especially in a case like the present, where the resident managing agent of the carrier knew for at least six days before
the arrival of the vessel that she would land and discharge
her cargo, not at the usual place, but at the Inman pier, and
thus had ample Qpportunity to give to the 'consignees, who
were known to the steamship cqmpany, notice of the change.
The true rule on this question is well stated by Judge Porter
in Kohn v. Packard, 3 La. 230, as follows: "There are in-

conveniences in whichever way the question is viewed.

On

the part of the owners of the ship, that of giving such notice
of the time and place of discharge, as will enable them to
bring knowledge of the fact home to the persons who are
to receive the goods, or in default thereof, imposing on the
former the obligation of sending the merchandise to some
place of safety. But this inconvenience we think is not to
be compared with that to which the latter would be subject
if their property could be landed without their knowledge
and be thereby lost or damaged. On the one side there is
additional trouble; on the other, probably, a total loss. After
the best consideration in our power, we think the conclusion
we have come to is most consonant to law and will tend to
promote public convenience."
The opinion of the court does not deal with that clause in
the bill of lading which provides that the steamship company,
or its "agents, or any of its servants, are not to be liable for
any damage to any goods which is capable of being covered
by insurance." The court below held that this clause relieved
the steamship company from liability. This condition or
provision of the bill of lading is expressed in terms so general
and comprehensive as to require the shipper or consignee to
insure, not only against the enumerated perils and exceptions,
but against any and all malfeasance or misfeasance on the part
of the carrier. It admits of grave doubt whether this provision is not so unreasonable as to be void under the principle

CONSTABLE 'v. NATIONAL STEAMSHIP CO.

laid down by this court in Railroad Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall.
357, 380, 382; Hart v. P0ennsylvania Railroad,112 U. S. 331;
Pb mix ns. Co. v. Erie Tan&portatio Co., 117 U. S. 312, 322,
323; Inma v. South Carolina Railway, 129 U. S. 128, 139 ;
Liverpool Steam Co. v.. Phenix Ins. Co., 129 U. S. 397, 455;
Carver on Carriers, (2d. ed.,) § 110; Peek v. .Yortk Stafordshie
Railway, 10 H. L. Cas. 473. In this last case the condition
was that the company, "shall not be responsible for loss of or.
injury to any marble' . . . unless declared and insured
according to its value," and it was held, upon full consideration, that the condition, as a whole, was unreasonable and
void.
In the present case it is not necessary to determine that
this clause is so unreasonable as to be void. So far as it has
been considered by the courts, it has been restricted in its application. Thus, in Taylor v. Liv. & Gt. Western Steamn Co.,
L. R. 9 Q. B. 546, it was held not to cover a loss of the goods
by theft, committed while they were on board, either during
the voyage, or after arrival; and in The Titania,19 Fed. Rep.
101, while the provision was-consideved valid, it was held by
the court that it must be construed-to refer to insurance which
might be obtained in the usual course of business from the
ordinary insurance companies, ither in the usual form, or in
the customary course of business upon special application.
In that case injury from the breaking loose of a spare propeller
was held not to be within the exemption.
Giving to the clause this reasonable construction, the loss in
question would not have been covered by the ordinary marine
policy on the cargo, which generally covers the goods while
being carried aboard ship, during the voyage, and Until afely
landed, and,no longer. The clause did not impose upon the
consignees the duty of anticipating that the carrier would
land the goods at an unusual place, and it would have been
out of the usual course of business for the consignees to have
sought to insure against what they did not, and could not,
know would take place.
So, in reference to fire insurance. While it was shown by
one of the witnesses that fire insurance could have been

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Field, Gray, JJ.

procured on "goods lying on the wharf by the side of the
ship, before they were actually taken away," the clause in
question did not require that the consignees should have
anticipated that their goods would be nloaded at night and
deposited on the wharf. Aside from this, it is ordinarily
essential in a fire insurance policy that the locality of the
risk should be specified. The consignees in the present case
could not have complied with this general rule without
having some knowledge or information as to where their
goods would be landed. The local agent of the steamship
company had six days' notice of the fact that the cargo of
the vessel would be landed at the Innan pier, No. 36, but
that fact was not communicated to the consignees, and they
had not, therefore, the data to procure ordinary fire insurance
upon the goods after being landed.
It would be unreasonable, and contrary to sound principle,
to allow the carrier to assert exemption under such an insurance clause without affording the consignees, by proper notice,
an opportunity to effect insurance in the usual way upon their
goods while deposited on the wharf. If, after being notified
that their goods were deposited on a particular wharf, other
than that at which their consignments were usually received,
the consignees had failed and neglected to take out insurance,
the clause, if valid, might have been invoked for the protection
of the carrier. But under the facts of this case, to give the
carrier the benefit of the clause would be to allow it to take
advantage of its own neglect of a legal requirement.
I am of opinion that the decree appealed from should' be
reversed, and the court below directed to enter a decree in
favor of the libellants; and I am authorized to state that MR.
JusTioE -FiEL and Mnr. JusT E GRAY concur in this opinion.
