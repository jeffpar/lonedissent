OCTOBER TERM, 1.893.
Opinion of the Court.

COVINGTON AND CINCINNATI ELEVATED RAILROAD AND TRANSFER AND BRIDGE COMPANY
,.

KENTUCKY.

ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF
No. 1043. Argued April 25,1894. -Decided

KENTUCKY.

May 26, 1894.

The judgment in this case is reversed on the authority of Covington & Cincinnati Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, ante, 204.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. William H. Jaokson, (with whom was -fr.
Wadsworth on the brief,) for plaintiff in error.

W. H.

.tr. William J. Hendrick, Attorney General of the State
of Kentucky, and .AXr. William Goebel for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE BROWN

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case differs from the last only in the fact that the
plaintiff in error was not incorporated until 1886, and subsequently to a general law of the State declaring that all
charters and grants of or to corporations shall be subject to
amendment or repeal at the will of the legislature. Conceding that these words became a part of its charter, and hence
that no contract was impaired by the legislation of 1890, such
legislation is still open to the objection found to exist in the
former case, that it is in conflict with the interstate commerce
clause of the Constitution.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky is,
therefore,
Reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further
proceedings.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, MR. JUSTICE FELp, MR. Jus-

and MR. JUSTICE WHITE concurred in the judgment
of reversal, for the like reasons as in the case of Covington
Bridge v. Kfentucky, ante, 204, 223.
