APPEALS FROM-X THE CIRCUIT COURT

OF THE

UNITED STATES FOR

THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
Nos. 737, 867, 865. Submitted January 2,1889. - Decided January 6, 1890.

1., a citizen of Texas, made his will there June 7 1848, by which he devised all his property including the real estate in controversy, (1) to
is wife for twenty-one years after his death; (2) after that to his offspring, child or children by his said wife; (3) in the event of the death
of his wife without offspring by him, to the children of Af. by M'.s then
wife, who was a sister of R.'s wife; (4) in the event of the death of the
offspring which he might have by his wife, to his wife for life. AL was
named as executor of the will. 1. died January 10, 1850, leaving surviving his wife and an infant son. This son was born after the making of
the will and died in 1854. The will was duly proved by the executor
shortly after R.'s death. About six months after R.'s death his widow
married F., by whom she had several children. Two years after the
probate of the will F and his wife commenced proceedings to have the
vill declared null and void on the ground that the property was communal property. In these proceedings the executor was defendant, and
a guardian ad litem was appointed for the infant, and such proceedings were had therein that in October, 1852, a decree was entered, declaring the will to be null and void, and setting it aside; Held,
(1) That the devise to the children of Al. was a contingent remainder,
to vest only in case of the death of the testator's wife without offspring by him, and limited after the fee which was primarily given
to the testator's child;
(2) That, the executor being a defendant and appearing and answering,
and the infant son being represented by a guardian ad literm, and
the executor being interested on behalf of his own children that
the will should stand, (if that was of any consequence,) all the
necessary parties were before the court to sustain the decree;
(3) That the decree could not be attacked collaterally and was binding
on the children of M.

dicial proceedings affecting the real estate, where the court has before it
all parties that can be brought 'before it in whom the present estate of
inheritance is vested, and the court acts upon the property, according
to the rights that appear, without fraud.
In Texas an equitable claun of title to real estate is equally available with a
legal one.
In Texas, the holder of a head-right certificate could locate it upon a tract
of public land, and then abandon the location and locate it upon another
tract, and, in such case the abandoned tract became thereby again public
land, subject to location by other parties.
From the evidence it would appear that the Rutledge certificate wich is in
controversy in this case was in the land office in Texas on or before
August 1, 1857, in compliance with the requirements of the act of the
Legislature of Texas of August 1, 1856. 1 Paschal's Digest, 701, art. 4210.
By the act of the legislature of Texas of April 25, 1871, 2 Paschal's Digest,
1453, arts. 7096-7099, it was provided that a certificate of location and
survey of public lands, not on file at the passage of that act, and not
withdrawn for locating an unlocated balance, should be returned to and
filed in the office within eight months thereafter, or the location and survev should be void, Held, that in the absence of clear proof that a valid
located certificate was not on file there within the statutory time, the
court would not raise such a presumption in favor of another title, superposed upon the land at a time when the certificate was valid and possession was enjoyed under it.
The practice of locating land certificates upon prior rightful locations is not
favored by the laws of Texas.
The failure of the holder of a head-right certificate in Texas to complete his
title, by complying with statutory provisions in regard to the filing of
his certificate, enures to the benefit of the State alone.
In Texas the rights of a subsequent locator, having actual notice of a prior
location, are postponed to the superior rights of the prior locator,
although the subsequent location may have passed into a patent.
The provisions in the constitution and laws of Texas respecting the location of land certificates., reviewed.
In Texas land certificates are chattels, and may be sold by parol agreement and
delivery the purchaser and grantee thereby acquiring the right to locate
a certificate and to take out a patent in his own name and to his own use.
The failure, in a certificate of acknowledgment of a deed of the separate
property of a married woman in Texas, to state that she was examined
apart from her husband, cannot be supplied by proof that such was the fact.
In Texas an habendum to a deed running "to have and to hold to him the
said" grantee, " his heirs and assigns forever, free from the just claim
or claims of any and all persons whomsoever, claiming or to claim the
same," imports a general warranty and estops the grantor and ins heirs
from setting up an adverse title against the grantee.
On the facts the court holds that the statute of limitations of Texas is a
complete bar to the claims set up by the complainants, both in the original bill and in the cross-bills.

Opinion of the Court.

IN EQmTrY. The suit, as it was commenced in a state court
in Texas, was an action of trespass, but, on its removal to the
Circuit Court of the United States, a repleader took place on
the equity side of the court. The original bill and the crossbills were dismissed, from which decree this appeal was taken.

JusrioE BuADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This suit was originally an action of trespass to try title,
brought in March, 1884, in the District Courf of Tarrant
County, Texas, by William L. Foster and his children, William
D. Foster and others, against Elizabeth J Daggett and her husband, E. B. Daggett, and The Texas and Pacific Railway Company, The Missouri Pacific Railway Company, The Fort Worth
and Denver Railway Company and The Gulf, Colorado and
Santa F6 Railway Company, to recover possession of 320 acres
of land in the city of Fort Worth. Much of the land in question is laid out m streets and covered with buildings, and nearly
100 acres of it is occupied by the said railroad companies, or
some of them, for their tracks, station houses, freight depots,
shops, etc. The plaintiffs claimed title as heirs at law of one
Thomas P Rutledge, through Eliza A. Foster, wife of William
L. Foster, and mother of the other plaintiffs, who had been
the wife and widow of said Rutledge, and mother of his only
son, deceased. The defendants filed answers, claiming the
lands under an alleged purchase from Rutledge of his headright certificate under which the lands were located, and also
under an independent title derived by purchase from the heirs

Opinion of the Court.

of one John Childress, and also by long and undisturbed possession. No patent for the lands had ever been granted on the
Rutledge title, which was older than the Childress title, but
a patent was granted on the latter m June, 1868 so that the
various clains under the Rutledge title were of an equitable
character, which, m the Texas jurisprudence, is equally available with the legal title.
In October, 1884, Thomas H. Miller and others, children of
one Alsey S. Miller, intervened in the suit as plaintiffs, claiming the same land as devisees of Thomas P Rutledge.
On the 20th of April, 1885, William Dunlap and others filed
their petition in the suit, claiming one-half interest in the lands
as heirs-at-law of Adaline S. Worrall, wife of one I. R.
Worrall, and on the 23d of March, 1886, Martha R. Worrall
and others intervened as plaintiffs, claiming the other half
interest in the lands as heirs-at-law of said Adaline, through
the said I. R. Worrall. The Dunlaps and the Worralls claim
under the same right, and allege that Adaline S. Worrall became entitled to the lands by purchase from the heirs of John
Childress, and that, on her dying without issue in 1870, her
brothers and sisters, represented by William Dunlap and
others, inherited one-half of her interest, and her husband, I.
R. Worrall, represented by his mother, Martha R. Worrall, and
others, inherited the other half.
In December, 1885, the original plaintiffs, William L. Foster
and his children, took a non-suit, and were dismissed out of the
case, leaving three sets of claimants to the land, to wit (1) the
original defendants, the Daggetts and the railroad companies,
who were in possession, claiming under all the titles, (2)
Thomas It. Miller and others, claiming as devisees of Thomas
P Rutledge, (3) the Dunlaps and the Worralls, claiming
under John Childress, through Adaline S. Worrall.
In March term, 1886, the last set of claimants, William
Dunlap and others, and Martha R. Worrall and others, who
were citizens of other states than Texas, removed the proceedings into the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern District of Texas, and in that court a repleader
took place on the equity side of the court. Thomas H. Miller

and others, claiming as devisees of Rutledge, filed a bill to
maintain their alleged equitable title to the land, and made
the other parties defendants, who all filed answers, and the
intervenors, Dunlap and others and Worrall and others, also
filed separate cross-bills, to which the other parties filed answers. The court below dismissed both the original and crossbills, and this appeal is brought from that decree.
The land in question, when the titles set up by the complainants originated in 1852 and 1868, was of small value,
but having become the site of a portion of the city of Fort
Worth, and of an important railroad centre, it has acquired
a very great value, and is the subject of earnest litigation.
The Rutledge title originated under a head-right for 320
acres of land in Texas, granted in October, 1846, to Thomas
P Rutledge as an emigrant, by the board of land commissioners of Gonzales County, where he then resided. It is
alleged by the defendants, and proof was adduced to show,
that Rutledge sold this certificate to one Matthew Brinson in
or about 1848, and that Brmson sold it to one M. T. Johnson
in 1851. It was located by Johnson (in Rutledge's name) on
the premises in dispute in 1851 or 1852, and a survey in pursuance of such location was made January 8, 1852, by A. J
Lee, deputy surveyor for the Robertson Land District. It had
previously been located on lands in Fannin County, but the
evidence shows (as we think) that that location was abandoned, and that the location on the lands in dispute took
the place of it.
The following is the copy of the survey made by Lee, to
wit

another tract of 320 acres somewhere in the same neighborhood, and in the year 1853 or 1854 he made an exchange with
Johnson for the lot in question, and in June, 1855, Johnson
executed to Daggett a deed, of which the following is a copy
to wit.

This deed was duly proved and recorded on the 30th day of
March, 1857. Daggett, according to the weight of the testimony, went into possession of the land. in 1854, prior to
the date of the deed, built upon and improved it, and occupied it as his homestead, (with the exception of such portions
as he sold or leased to other parties,) until his death April
19th, 1883. The defendants Elizabeth J. Daggett and her
husband claim portions of the land under the will of said
E. M. Daggett, and the railroad companies clan other portions as his grantees; and both allege that the possession of
said E. IM.Daggett and of themselves under him has been continuous for nearly thirty years prior to the commencement of
the suit, namely, from the time when said Daggett first took
possession of the land in 1854, and that such possession has
been under a deed duly registered from the time the said deed
was given by Johnson to Daggett.
T. H. Miller et al., the complainants, deny that IRutledge
ever sold Ins head-right certificate to Brinson, or any one else,
and claim that its location on the land in question enured to
the benefit of Rutledge alone, and to themselves as his devisees, under a will made by hin on the 7th of June, 1848.
That will is in evidence. By it, Rutledge devised, first, all his
property to his wife, Eliza A. Rutledge, for twenty-one years
after his death, and after giving some directions about certain.
specific personal property, devised as follows:
"Fifth. I direct that after the expiration of twenty-one
years from and after my death, all of my estate, both real and
personal, shall be owned and enjoyed by my offspring or child
or children by my said wife.

T2fILLER v. TEXAS AND PAC. RAILWAY.

669

Opinion of the Court.

"Seventh. In the event of the death of my said wife without
offspring by me at her death which may survive her, I direct
that all of my estate, real and personal, shall be owned equally
by the children of Alsey S. Miller which may survive me,
which he may have by his present wife.
"Eighth. In the event of the death of the offspring which I
may have by my said wife, I direct that my said wife shall
have all of my estate, both real and personal, for and during
her life.
"CNinth. I do appoint the said Alsey S. Miller, of said
county and state, my executor of this my last will and testament."

Rutledge died on the 10th of January, 1850, leaving surviving him his wife, Eliza A. Rutledge, and an infant son, William M. Rutledge, who was born after the making of the will,
but who died in 1854, about six years of age. Eliza A.
Rutledge, after her husband's death, married William L.
Foster in July, 1850, by whom she had several children, and
died in February, 1881.
The will was regularly proved m April, 1850, by Alsey S.
Miller. the executor, whose wife was a sister of Eliza A.
Rutledge, and whose children were the devisees in remainder
named m the will. It will be seen that the said remainder
was a contingent one, to vest only in case of the death of the
testator's wife without offspring by him. It was also limited
after the fee which was primarily given to the testator's child.
More than two years after the probate of the will, proceedings were instituted by William L. Foster and his wife Eliza
A. Foster, in the District Court of Gonzales County, having
the proper jurisdiction, to have the will declared null and
void. Alsey S. Miller, the executor, was made defendant, and
the court appointed S. B. Conley guardian ad litem for William
Ml. Rutledge, the infant child of the testator. The petition for
nullfty of the will alleged that the property of the deceased
was community property, that the will was made before the
birth of the child, that the disposition made was contrary to
law, and trammelled with illegal and embarrassing conditions.
It further stated that the executor had faithfully performed

Opinion of the Court.

his trust, had paid all debts of the estate, and was ready to
close it. The executor filed an answer, admitting the allegations of the petition, and not opposing its prayer. The guardian ad literm filed an answer, leaving the matter under the
control of the court to act in its wise discretion as to justice
should seem meet. The court thereupon made a decree as
follows:
"Saturday, October 23d, 1852.
"Came all the parties by their att'ys, and S. B. Conley, Esq.,
guardian ad literm for the minor, W M. Rutledge, and the
matters and things being all before the court by the pleading
and record evidence therein, the same was submitted to the
court, and, being heard, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed
by the court that the will of the deceased, Thomas P Rutledge,
made on the 7th June, 1848, and admitted to probate on the
29th April, 1850, be, and the same is hereby, declared to be
null, void, and of no effect, and that the same be in all things
set aside and held for naught. It is further ordered, adjudged
and decreed that the said Eliza Ann Foster, as relict of said
Rutledge, deceased, and the said W M. :Rutledge, minor, be
entitled to take, receive and hold all the property of said
deceased jointly between them as heirs-at-law, be the same
real, personal or mixed, and subject to the action of the county
court of Gonzales County as to distribution after the debts are
paid and estate closed by the report of the executor, whose
acts under the will are not impaired by this decree, and that
said court is required to make the yearly allowance to the
said Eliza Ann Foster, in accordance with law and the order
of said county court. It is further ordered and adjudged that
the executor, out of the funds of the estate, pay the costs
herein expended, and that this decree be duly certified to the
county court for observance."
If this decree is valid, it disposes of the claim of the complainants, Thomas H. Miller and others, which is based on the
devise of the will. The precise question came before the
Supreme Court of Texas in the recent case of Thomas I.

MILLER v. TEXAS AID PAC. RAILWAY.
Opinion of the Court.

Miller et al. v. W L. Foster et al., (not yet reported,) and was
decided against the contention of the appellants, Miller et al.
The Commission of Appeals held that the decree of nullity
was valid, and that all the necessary parties were before the
court when it was rendered. This decision was approved by
the Supreme Court.
It is contended by appellants that the decision in the case of
-facArthur v Scott, 113 U. S. 340, is adverse to this view
But a careful examination of that case will show that this is
not correct. The decree settmig aside the will in that case
was held not to be binding upon certain grandchildren of the
testator, not born when it was passed, because their interests
(which were executory) were supported by a legal trust estate
in the executors, which was not represented in the proceedings.
INo trustee of that estate was made a party The executors had
resigned their office, and the court had accepted their resignation and no new trustee had been appointed in their stead, as
might have been done. There was no party in the case to
represent the will, or the interests created by it, or the legal
estate which supported those interests. This was the special
ground on which the decision in -MacArthur v Scott was
placed, as is fully expressed in the opinion.
In the present case the executor was a defendant in the proceedings instituted for avoiding the will, and appeared and
filed an answer, and the infant son of Rutledge, who was devisee in fee of the whole estate after the termination of his
mother's interest, was represented in the proceedings by a
guardian ad litem. Moreover, if the circumstance is of any
consequence, the executor was interested on behalf of his own
children that the will should stand, -as they were the principal devisees in remainder. We think that the Supreme
Court of Texas was right in holding that all the necessary
parties were before the court. We are also of opinion that
the decree avoiding the will cannot be attacked collaterally,
and that it is binding on the appellants, Thomas H. Miller and
others. The entire estate was represented before the court, a particular estate in the widow, and the fee simple remainder
in the infant son. The interest of the appellants, Thomas H.

Miller and others, as devisees under the will, was a mere contingent interest, a mere executory devise. In such a case it is
sufficient to bind the estate in judicial proceedings to have before the court those in whom the present estate of inheritance
is vested. Lord Redesdale's authority on this point is decisive.
In Gifar'd v Hort, 1 Sch. & Lef. 386, 408, he says: "Where
all the parties are brought before the court that can be brought
before it, and the court acts on the property according to the
rights that appear, without fraud, its decision must of necessity
be final and conclusive. It has been repeatedly determined
that if there be tenant for life, remainder to his first son in
tail, remainder over, and he is brought before the court before he has issue, the contingent remainder-men are barred."
In another part of the same opinion Lord Redesdale said
"Courts of equity have determined on grounds of high expediency that it is sufficient to bring before the court the first
tenant in tail in being, and if there be no tenant in tail in
being, the first person entitled to the inheritance, and if no
such person, then the tenant for life." Ib. ibid. These propositions are substantially repeated in his Treatise on Pleading,
173, 174, where he adds, "Contingent limitations and executory
devises to persons not in being may in like manner be bound
by a decree against a person claiming a vested estate of inheritance, but a person in being claiming under a limitation by
way of executory devise, not subject to any preceding vested
estate of nheritanceby whtch -it may be defeated,must be made
a party to a bill affecting his rights." In the present case, it is
true, some of the children of Alsey S. Miller were in being at
the time of the proceedings in question (1852), but there was a
"preceding vested estate of inheritance," by which their executory devise might be defeated, namely, the estate vested in the
infant child of Thomas P Rutledge, who was a party to the
proceedings. We are of opinion that the bill of Thomas H.
Miller and others was properly dismissed by the court below
The complainants in the cross-bills, William Dunlap and
others, and Martha R. Worrall and others, claim the lands
under the other source of title, that of John Childress, and, to
avoid the effect of the defendants' claim under the Rutledge

certificate, they deny that it was assigned by Rutledge to
Brinson, or by Brinson to M. T. Johnson, deny that it was
ever lawfully located on the land in question, and aver, that
if it was ever properly located thereon, it became void by noncompliance with the land laws of Texas.
The Childress title arose in the following manner John
Childress, a brother-in-law of the late Mr. Justice Catron, and
brought up in his family, was an early emigrant to Texas
under the patronage of his uncle, Sterling C. Robertson,
empressario of a colony on the Brazos River. His first visit to
Texas was in 1834, and in 1836 he took his wife and two
children with him, namely, John W Childress and George
R. Childress. Though numbered among the colonists of Mr.
Robertson, for some reason he failed to obtain any valid grant
of land, though undoubtedly entitled to one. lHe died in
Texas in the fall of 1837. By an act of the legislature of
Texas, passed February 13, 1860, the Commissioner of the
Court of Claims was authorized to issue to the heirs of John
Childress a land certificate for one league and one labor of
land (amounting to about 4605 acres). His widow had, in the
meantime, married one M iles Johnson, by whom she bad a
daughter named Mary As the act of the legislature was
expressed to be for the benefit of the heirs of John Childress,
it would seem that no interest in the grant enured to the said
Mary On the 9th of March, 1860, a land certificate was issued
by the Commissioner of the Court of Claims to the heirs of
John Childress as authorized by the act. It was procured by,
and delivered to, a lawyer of Austin by the name of John A.
Green, who was employed by Judge Catron on behalf of the
heirs to attend to the business. The heirs, John W Childress
and his brother George, seem to have been of a roving disposition. John appeared at Austin in December, 1860, and,
supposing that his brother George, who had not been heard
from recently, was dead, he gave Green a power of attorney
to locate the said certificate in the following manner, namely,
one-third for the benefit of his brother George, if he should
be alive, and if not, then for John's own benefit, one-third for
the benefit of Green, as a compensation for his services, and

Opinion of the Court.

onethird for the benefit of one John 0. St. Clair, to whom
John W Childress had sold his own share. No location of
the certificate was made until after the war.
In May, 1867, Green sold his one-third of the certificate to
Doctor I. R. Worrall, of Austin. The deed given cannot be
found, but it is alleged on the part of William Dunlap and
others, and Martha R. Worrall and others,, that it was given
to Worrall's wife, Adaline S. Worrall, under whom they claim.
The deed, as above said, is lost, and the records of Tarrant
County were destroyed by fire in the spring of 1876, but Mr.
Furman, a lawyer of Fort Worth, had, before the fire, made
an abstract of titles from the county records, and in that
abstract he finds, amongst other things, (1) a transfer from
John W Childress to John A. Green, conveying one-third of
the grantor's interest in the Childress certificate, filed October
8th, 1868 (date not given), (2) a transfer of the same interest
from John A. Green to Adaline S. Worrall, dated May 15th,
1867, filed October 12th, 1868. In addition to this evidence,
in the deed from Dr. Worrall and his wife to E. M. Daggett,
dated September 30th, 1869, and hereafter to be mentioned,
it is recited that the land in question (conveyed by that deed)
was the separate property of said Adaline S. Worrall. We
think, therefore, that it may be regarded as proven that the
deed for the one-third of the Childress certificate, given by
John A. Green in M ay, 1867, was given to Adaline S. Worrall,
though Green himself says that he has no recollection to that
effect, and that all his transactions were with Dr. Worrall
himself.
On the 28th of January, 1868, Dr. Worrall presented to
the county surveyor of Tarrant County the following application for a survey, to wit

Beginning at the S. E. cor. of A. Briggs's survey and S. W
corner of B. F Crowley's and running so as to embrace and
include all the vacant land connected with said point. That is
the said Rutledge survey
11 R. WoimAL."

A survey was made accordingly on the top of the Rutledge
survey by adopting the notes of the same, and the county
surveyor certified it as follows, to wit "I, A. G. Walker,
county surveyor for Tarrant County, do hereby certify that
the survey designated by the foregoing plot and field-notes
was this day made by me by adopting field-notes of the survey which was made, as above stated, the 16th January, 1852,
and which I believe to be correct, and that the same is upon
s'd survey which is in the name of T. P Rutledge, certificate
No. 134, class 3rd, issued by the board of land commissioners
of Gonzales County the 12th day of October, 1846." Dated
"this 28th day of May, 1868." On the 17th of June, 1868, a
patent was issued on this survey to "the heirs of John Childress, deceased, their heirs and assigns."
It thus appears that the Ohildress survey, under which the
complainants in the cross-bills claim title to the land in dispute,
was purposely made by Dr. Worrall on the top of the Rutledge survey, under which Daggett had been in possession of
the land for thirteen years. Of course such a title cannot be
maintained unless the survey made under the Rutledge certificate was void. It is contended that it was void, first, because
the certificate had been located on other lands in Fannin
County, before its location on the lot at Fort Worth. This is
true. Rutledge had procured a conditional head-right certificate for 320 acres as early as March 20th, 1839, from the
board of land commissioners of Washington County, and had
in March, 1846, procured a survey under it for 320 acres in
Fannin County, which was duly examined and approved, and
filed in the General Land Office, but was afterwards endorsed
as forfeited for non-return of unconditional certificate by 1st

August, 1857. Rutledge seems to have abandoned this survey, and in October, 1816, obtained a new certificate in Gonzales County, as before stated, under which the survey in Fort
Wbrth, Tarrant County, was made. It was permitted to a settler to abandon one location and adopt another. Indeed, the
new certificate and location operated as an abandonment of the
first, and the land became public land again, subject to location by other parties. In .MGinpsey v. Ramsdale, 3 Texas,
344, the court sustained a survey made after a former survey
under the same head-right had been abandoned, the judge
who delivered the opinion saying "If the question was a new
one, I should feel strongly inclined to deny the right of Ramsdale to have raised his former location, but the practice commenced with our land system, and to upset it now, would disturb land titles to an incalculable extent." We do not think
that the location of Rutledge's head-right in Fannin County
was sufficient to prevent his obtaining a new certificate and a
location in Tarrant County, unless he had sold or otherwise
disposed of the lands in Fannin County There is no proof in
the case that he had done so, although one of the witnesses,
Nance, who resides in Fort Worth, testifies that in September,
1859, being in Austin, and having understood that Daggett
could not get his land patented, he inquired of Mr. White, the
then commissioner of the General Land Office, why he could
not, and the reason given was, that the conditional certificate
had been issued long before and had been long before located
in Fannin County by another man, to whom it belonged. But
as there is no proof of this fact in the record, except the said
hearsay testimony, we must conclude that this ground of objection to the Rutledge location is not sustained.
We do not deem it necessary to take particular notice of the
Cass County location under the Rutledge certificate, which
seems to have been abandoned, or of the survey under the
William Sparks certificate, which was fully satisfied by other
locations, and was never set up as establishing any right to
the property in dispute. These documents may for the time
have deterred the commissioner of the General Land Office from
granting a patent to Daggett, but we do not see that they

present any insurmountable obstacle to the validity of the
survey made by Johnson.
Another ground urged for maintaining that the said location
was void when the Childress location was made is, that the unconditional certificate was withdrawn from the General Land
Office and not returned within the time required by law
The old wrapper in which it had been folded, and which also
contained the survey, was endorsed with the words, "forfeited
for non-return of unconditional certificate by 1st Aug. 1857."
And yet there was another still older memorandum in pencil,
faint and partly obliterated, which read thus "Unconditional
Dec. 14, '57,
certificate withdrawn by Mif. T. Johnson
for relocation." A. B. McGill testifies that he was a clerk in
the General Land Office from 1859 to 1866, except a short
period towards the close of the war, and was chief clerk from
1865 or 1866 to 1870, that the endorsement, "forfeited for
non-return of unconditional certificate by 1st Aug. 1857," is in
his handwriting, and was written when he was chief clerk,
that the other endorsement, "unconditional certificate withDec. 14, '57, for relocation,"
drawn by M. T. Johnson
is in the handwriting of Robert M. Elgin, who was chief clerk
of the said office in 1857, and until the close of the war, that
only the commissioner and chief clerk were authorized to
make such memoranda or endorsements on the files , that he
(McGill) had no recollection of having seen the pencil memorandum at the time of making his endorsement in ink, that
from the appearance of the endorsements he would say that
the pencil endorsement was made prior to the time when he
(McGill) made the endorsements in ink referred to.
Joseph Spence, formerly commissioner of the land office,
testifies as follows, to wit.
"I was commissioner of the land office in 1868. The first
knowledge that I had of the Thomas P Rutledge survey in
Tarrant County was after the Childress survey had been made
and returned. Dr. I. R. Worrall controlled the Childress survey and was anxious to get a patent upon it. Upon examination of the Childress survey, it was ascertained to cover the
Thomas P Rutledge survey Mr. A. B. McGill, who was

chief clerk of the land office, referred to me both the Chil.
dress and the Rutledge papers, with the information that the
Rutledge certificate was not found among the papers of the
file. We then together examined the papers, but failed to
find the certificate. I remarked to him that we had better
not patent until further investigation. Shortly afterwards
Dr. Worrall insisted upon the patent issuing on the Childress
certificate, and we, not finding the Rutledge certificate, determined to issue the patent on said Childress certificate, and did
SO.),
This evidence shows that the Rutledge certificate was not in
the land office, or could not be found therein, in 1868, when
the Childress patent was issued, and when undoubtedly McGill,
the chief clerk, made the endorsement testified to by him.
But it fails to prove that it was not in the office on the 1st of
August, 1857. The endorsements on the back of the certificate
itself show that it was filed in the office October 4th, 1852
(probably at the same time with the survey), and across its
face, in red ink, is written "Registered and approved Dec. 11,
1857'." (Signed) "Jas. 0. Illingsworth, omnm'r of Claims."
This memorandum, in connection with the old pencil memorandum on the wrapper, "Withdrawn by M. T. Johnson
Dec. 14, '5,"shows that, at that time, December, 185T,
Johnson, who was undoubtedly acting for Daggett, was attending to the final authentication of the Rutledge certificate
and survey, by getting it approved by the commissioner of
claims, and that, for some reason, not now disclosed, he carried
it away with him. [The presentation of the certificate to the
commissioner of claims, and its registry by him, were made in
pursuance of an act passed August 1st, 1856, which created the
said officer, and required all land certificates (with certain exceptions) to be presented to him for registry within two years,
or to be forever barred from location, surveys and patent.]
The whole evidence, taken together, instead of showing, as
supposed by McGill in 1868, when he made the endorsement
on the wrapper, that it had not been returned to the office
by the 1st of August, 1857, rather shows that it was never
removed from the office until December, 1857. How long it

was then detained does not appear. We infer from the testimony that it was in the office in 1867. The official land map
of Tarrant County was made in that year, and the land in
question was marked and designated as the T. P Rutledge
survey, and so continued until 1873. This would hardly have
been done if the certificate had not been in the office. When
it was taken out of the office, after that, does not appear, probably it was taken out by iDaggett for some purpose and
neglected to be returned, as it was shown that he was very
careless about his papers. J P Smith, a lawyer of Fort
Worth, and administrator of Daggett, testifies that in 1879 or
1880 he was counsel for him in a suit of Turner's heirs against
hn for a community interest under their grandmother, flaggett's wife, (who bad died in 1871,) and he wanted the certificate in question, and, not finding it in the land office, he had
Daggett search for it, and Daggett found it in his own safe
and gave it to Smith, who, after keeping it two or three days,
carried it to Austin by Daggett's authority, and handed it to
the commissioner of the land office, and requested him to have
it returned to its proper file in the office.
The laws which gave importance to the locality or place of
deposit of the certificate were an act of the legislature of Texas
passed August 30th, 1856, and another act passed April 25th,
1871. Paschal's Dig., Vol. I, Art. 4210, p. 701, and Vol. II, Arts.
7096-7099, p. 1453. The first of these acts declared "that all
owners or holders who have conditional certificates now located, or surveys upon lands, shall return to the General Land
Office the unconditional certificates, together with the fieldnotes of the same, on or before the first day of Augmst, 1857,
and all unconditional certificates which are not returned by
that tne, the said locations and surveys shall be null and void,
and all such locations and surveys made by virtue of such conditional certificates shall become public domain, and subject to
be located upon as other vacant lands." In our view of the
evidence, this law did not affect the Rutledge title. The Przma
.face proof is that the certificate was in the land office from
1852 to December, 1857, and that the chief clerk, McGill,
made a mistake in endorsing the wrapper as he did, "forfeited

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opimon of the Court.

for non-return of unconditional certificate by Ist August, 1857."
As already suggested, this endorsement was probably made in
1868, when Dr. Worrall applied for a patent on the Childress
survey, and no doubt was honestly made. McGill admits
that he did not notice the pencil memorandum on the old
wrapper.
By the act of 25th April, 1871, it was provided that in all
cases of location and survey of lands, by virtue of any genuine
land certificate, including head-rights, etc., the certificate should
be returned to the General Land Office with the field-notes
within the time prescribed for returning field-notes [which was
twelve months from the date of survey], and the withdrawal of
it from the office should render the location and survey null and
void, with a proviso allowing a withdrawal where the certificate had only been located in part, and by the second section
of the act it was provided that, in all such cases, if the certificate was not on fie in the General Land Office at the time of
passing the act, and had not been withdrawn for locating an
unlocated balance, it should be returned to, and filed in, the
said office within eight months from the passage of the act, or
the location and survey should be void. It was strenuously
contended that the case was within this statute, and, therefore,
that the Rutledge survey was void. But it is not absolutely
certain from the evidence that the Rutledge certificate was not
in the land office when the act of 1871 was passed, or that it
was not returned thereto within eight months from that time,
which period expired on the 24th of December, 1871. It is
true, it was not found by the clerk in 1868 when the patent
was issued on the Childress survey, and it was not found on
a subsequent search in 1875. Resort must be had to presumptions to conclude that it was not there in 1871. Will such a
presumption be raised m favor of another title superposed upon
the land at a time when the Rutledge certificate was perfectly
valid, and possession was enjoyed under it 2 And even if it
were sufficiently proven that the certificate was not in the
office during the years in question, the question would still
arise whether the claimants under the Ohildress survey and
patent can take advantage of this circumstance to maintain

MILLER v. TEXAS AND PAC. RAThWAY.
Opinion of the Court.

their title to the property When that title was created, in
1868, as already intimated, the Rutledge survey was in full
force and effect, and Daggett was in possession under it, and
had been so for thirteen years. Did, therefore, the injunction
of the statute of 1871, requirmg the survey to be returned to
the land office within eight months, under penalty of being
void if not so returned, enure to the benefit of the holders of
the Childress patent, or did it enure to the benefit of the
State ? The Childress survey when made was void, and therefore the patent issued upon it was void, because made and
granted upon lands already appropriated under an elder title,
which title, at that time, was perfectly valid, and only became
invalid by non-compliance with a statute subsequently passed
for reasons of public policy did the Childress survey and
patent, which were void at their inception, become invested
with life and validity by means of the subsequent law and the
failure to comply with it 2 If the question was only one
between the holders of the Rutledge title and the State, then
no parties other than the State could take advantage of the
omission to comply with the law
The practice of locating certificates upon prior rightful locations is not favored by the laws of Texas. It was declared by
the act of August 30th, 1856, (Pasch. Dig. Vol. I, Art. 4575,)
that whenever an entry is made upon any land which appears
to be appropriated, deeded or patented by the books of the
proper surveyor's office, or records of the County Court, or
General Land Office, the party shall abide by it, and if judgment be rendered against him he shall not have the right to
lift or re-enter the certificate, but the same shall be forfeited.
The purpose of this act was further secured by the constitution
of 1869, by the 10th article of which, section 3, it was declared
that "all certificates for land located after the 30th day of
October, 1856" (referring undoubtedly to, but mistaking the
date of, the last mentioned act) "upon lands which were
titled before such location of certificate, are hereby declared
null and void," with a proviso in favor of inadvertent conflict
with older surveys. Of course if the certificate was made
void, the location and survey were a fortiorz void, and the

Opinion of the Court.

obtaining of a patent could not mend the matter, for it was
decided by the Supreme Court of Texas, in 3Iorms v B.rtler,
11 Texas, 285, that a subsequent locator having actual notice
of a prior location will be postponed to the superior rights of
the prior locator, although the subsequent location may have
passed into a patent.
The provision of the constitution of 1869, just cited, was
retrospective, was in force when the act of 1871 was passed,
and was carried forward, as to all future locations and surveys,
into the constitution of 1876, which declared, "that all genuine
land certificates heretofore or hereafter issued shall be located,
surveyed, or patented only upon vacant and unappropriated
public domain, and not upon any land titled or equitably
owned under color of title from the sovereignty of the State,
evidence of the appropriation of which is on the county records
or in the General Land Office, or when the appropriation is evidenced by the occupation of the owner, or of some person
holding for him." Art. 14, sect. 2.
These constitutional provisions, (whose validity upon the
subject in hand cannot be seriously questioned,) taken in connection with the act of 1856, had the effect to make void the
location of the Childress certificate upon the land in dispute,
for, at that time (1868) the said land was "appropriated" and
"titled" by the survey under the Rutledge certificate, which
was duly recorded in the county records and entered and filed
in the General Land Office, plotted on the map of Tarrant
County, and evidenced by the long-continued occupation of
Dagett. If, then, the Childress location was absorutely void
at its inception, how could it be revived by the subsequent
failure of Daggett to comply with the act of 1871 2 It seems
to us quite clear that it could not be, and that said failure
enured to the benefit of the State alone. But the State has
never availed itself of the omission, and it is probable that
nothing but a direct proceeding to vacate the survey would be
effectual for the purpose. Daggett and those claiming under
him having always been in notorious possession of the land, no
person could lay any new location upon it without full knowledge of their pretensions to the ownership, and it was held

MILLER v. TEXAS AND PAC. RAILWAY.

Opinon of the Court.

by the Supreme Court of Texas in the recent case of Swtder
v .fethwm, 60 Texas, 487, that no one having knowledge of
the continued claim of those who made title to land under a
certificate could acquire any right to said land, although said
certificate had been taken from the land office prior to the
passage of the act of 1871, and was not returned within the
period required by that act. It is true, that the certificate in
that case had been taken from the office by a person who had
no interest in it, or right to control it, but the parties interested had notice of its absence in time to have supplied a
duplicate, but did not do so until after the prescribed time had
expired.
In the present case the certificate was returned to the office
in 1879 or 1880, from which it had probably been inadvertently detained by Daggett. As between the parties to this
controversy, our opinion is, that the lRutledge title must prevail, and that it is a sufficient protection to the defendants
against that set up by the complainants in the cross-bills.
This view of the case renders of less importance a question
which might have been very material as between the original
complainants, Thomas I. Miller and others, and the defendants, had not the former been barred by the decree annulling
Rlutledge's will. We refer to the question as to the assignment by Rutledge of his certificate to Brmson and by Brmson
to M. T. Johnson. We are satisfied from the evidence in the
case that Rutledge sold said certificate to Brinson and that
Brinson sold it to Johnson, at whose instance, and in whose
behalf, it was located on the land in question. M. J Brinson,
son of Matthew Brinson, to whom it is alleged Rutledge sold
the certificate, testifies that about 1848 or 1849 Rutledge and
one Gill were in the business of horse-raising and horse-trading,
and were occasionally at his father's place in Shelby County,
and one deal they made with him was the sale to him of the
land certificate in question for which the witness's father gave
them a pony belonging to witness, (who was then about twenty
years old,) and his father gave him another horse instead of
it, that afterwards, about 1851, M . T. Johnson bought the
certificate of witness's father, and that Johnson afterwards

Opinon of the Court.

traded it to Captain E. M. Daggett.

It is true, the witness

did not handle the certificate, but derived his knowledge of it
from conversation with his father and cotemporaneous knowledge of the transactions.
The witness further states that
whilst his father (Matthew 3rinson) owned the certificate he
employed Gill to locate it, or have it located for him, but
found that he was making a fraudulent use of the certificate,
using itin what he termed "lariating land," in Fannin County,
and he was obliged to institute proceedings to get possession
of it, and finally got it back from some member of Gill's
family after his death.
But no assignment of this certificate from Rutledge can
now be found. If one ever existed, it is lost or has been
destroyed.
lowever, if a sale of the certificate was actually
made by Rutledge to Brinson, and by the latter to Johnson,
it matters little whether it was actually assigned in writing or
not, as it is well settled m Texas that the land certificates of
that State are chattels, and may be sold by parol agTeement
and delivery, whereby the purchaser acquires a right to locate
the certificate and procure a patent in the name of the grantee,
but for his own use, he becoming thereby the equitable owner
of the land located. Cox v. Bray, 28 Texas, 24, Peevy v
Hfurt, 32 Texas, 146, Stone v Brown, 54 Texas, 330, 334,
Parkerv 8pencer, 61 Texas, 155, 164. In Cox v Bray, Chief
Justice Moore said "But even if the contract were within the
statute" [of frauds] "the payment of the purchase money,
the location of the land, the procuring of the patent, and the
possession and improvements made upon it by the defendant
and those under whom he claims, would, as has been frequently decided by this court, have presented sufficient equity
to have entitled the defendant to a decree of title, if he
had brought a suit for this purpose within a reasonable and
proper time.
And it certainly could not be less effectual to protect him against the wrongful efforts of the vendor
to deprive him of his possession and equitable title to the land,
however long he may have delayed his suit for this purpose."
p. 261.
Even when a written assignment was made, it was often

MILLER v. TEXAS AND PAC. RAIILWAY.
Opinion of the Court.

made with a blank space left for the name of the assignee, to
be filled up with the name of any subsequent purchaser who
saw fit to insert his own name therein, - much the same as
blank assignments of corporation stock, which pass from hand
to hand, perhaps a dozen times, before they are filled up with
the name of an assignee. It is distinctly stated in M11 v
J2foore, 62 Texas, 610, 614, that "land certificates were the
subjects of transfer, and often passed through the hands of
inny persons by an assignment in blank." In that case one
Jowell owned a land certificate as community property, and,
after his wife's death, sold it to one who was a purchaser
in good faith, and without notice of the community The
heirs of the wife brought suit for a portion of the land located
under the certificate, and contended that the purchaser was
bound to take notice of the wife's interest. But it did not
appear on the record whether the certificate was issued on
Jowell's own head-right, or some other person's. The court
held that, for all that appeared, it might have been obtained
in the way indicated above. "So far as the record shows,"
says the court, "it may have been true that Jowell purchased
the certificate through a blank assignment, and that he transferred with this assignment on it, simply by delivering it to
the persons through whom the appellee claims, if so, his name
would not even appear, either on the certificate or on any
writing by which the transfer was made, and in such case a
purchaser would not be put on inquiry as to the rights of other
persons, unless it be of those persons who claim by inheritance
from the original grantee, or some one in whom a right vested
by operation of law, at the time the certificate issued."
There seems to have been an assignment of this kind of
Rutledge's unconditional certificate. Two witnesses are sworn
in the case who distinctly testify that they saw it, with Johnson's name inserted as assignee. One of these is C. G. Payne,
of Dallas County, Texas, an attorney-at-law He states that in
January, 1868, he visited the land office at Austin, to investigate some land claims and land locations in Tarrant County
Whilst there he examined the Rutledge claim. He says he
found that two certificates had been issued to Rutledge,

Opinion of the Court.

namely, a conditional one upon which a survey had been
made in Cass County, and an unconditional certificate transferred by Rutledge to M. T. Johnson, and by Johnson located
in Tarrant County at Fort Worth upon the land now in controversy, the field-notes and survey returned to the General
Land Office, and there filed, mapped and platted, and the
patent refused on account of the unconditional certificate
located in Cass County He says that the transfer of the latter certificate from Rutledge to Johnson was written in a
coarse, rough, round handwriting. The usual form of transfers
of certificates was used. The substance of said transfer was
an assignment of all right, title, claim and interest of said
T. P Rutledge of, in and to the said certificate to the said
M1. T. Johnson, and authority therein authorizing the commissioner of the General Land Office to issue the patent to the said
M. T. Johnson or to his assigns. On his cross-examination
the witness says, that the transfer was acknowledged before
some officer authorized to use a seal, and had his certificate of
acknowledgment and seal thereon. He states that he also saw
the deed from Johnson to E. M. Daggett on record in Tarrant County
The other witness who testifies to having seen the assignment of the unconditional certificate from Rutledge to Johnson is W H. H. Lawrence. He testifies that he was engaged
in the land business at and about Fort Worth, that he had
transactions with E. M. Daggett from 1873 to 1878, and examined his title papers at his request, especially in reference to
the 320 acres tract known as the Rutledge survey, that this
examination was made, he thinks, in 1876, and he distinctly
remembers making a favorable report to Daggett after he had
finished the examination. He further says "My recollection
is that among the papers I examined was the Thomas P Rutledge certificate. I did find a transfer of such certificate to
M. T. Johnson. I am sure of this, because had it not been
present I should have known that the title from Rutledge was
defective." Being asked from whom, to whom, and the form
thereof, he said. "I can only say that it was from Rutledge
to .-[. T. Johnson, and in the usual form of transfers of such

MLLE R v. TEXAS AND PAC. RAILWAY.
Opinon of the Court.

certificates." The witness further states "If there had been
no transfer I should have discovered it and made a different
report." To another interrogatory he added "I had occasion
in very many cases to look up the titles of different lands in
Texas, and became familiar in the course of five years in the
land business at Fort Worth with the general laws of the State
in regard to lands, as also familiar with the examination of
titles."
Apparently (but perhaps not necessarily) opposed to the
hypothesis that the certificate in question was purchased by
Johnson from Brinson is the evidence of Henry Beaumont,
who testifies that in the winter of 1851-2 he placed a lot of
land certificates, including the T. P Rutledge certificate for
320 acres, in the hands of Y1. T. Johnson for location, under
a written contract and that the certificate in question had
come into his hands with others from a party (whose name
he does not mention) who had been engaged in locating and
surveying lands, and was then retiring from the business. In
corroboration of this testimony a receipt in the handwriting
of IM.T. Johnson was produced in evidence, a copy of which
is as follows, to wit

A duplicate of this receipt was found amongst Johnson's
papers after his death by J P Smith, his administrator.
It is somewhat difficult to reconcile this evidence with That
of the other witnesses. There is evidently wanting some undiscovered explanation of the discrepancy Beaumont says
that he only had the certificate for location, and that Johnson was to divide with him the emoluments thereof, -which
were always one-third of the land located. From the testimony of J P Smith, Johnson's administrator, it appears that
Beaumont and Johnson had had dealings together in the location of land certificates for some years prior to the date of the
receipt, to wit, in 1850 and 1851. The certificates mentioned
in the receipt were probably received by Johnson at some
time, or at different times, previous to the giving of the receipt. One of the certificates was that of Win. P Mlilby, for
640 acres, class 3, No. 24, issued 4th of Mlarch, 1845. This
certificate was located June 25th, 1850,- a year and ine
months before the date of the receipt. The certificate in question, that of IRutledge, was located January 8th, 1852, two
months before the date of the receipt. The suggestion of the
complainants that the survey was antedated has no evidence
to support it. That, in some way, Johnson had become
entitled to these certificates (especially to the Rutledge certificate) is corroborated by strong circumstances. Smith, Johnson's administrator, says that Beaumont never asserted any
claim to the land mentioned in the receipt. He had correspondence and communications with Beaumont after Johnson's
death. He says that there was an agreement between them
that Johnson should locate the certificates placed in his hands
by Beaumont, and was to have for doing so one-half of such
interest as Beaumont had in them, yet no -claim for any
accounting was ever made after Johnson's death. It is quite

possible that Beaumont obtained the Rutledge certificate from
Gill, who used it as a "lariat" for improperly locating land,
and that Johnson bought it of Brinson on ascertaining that it
belonged to him. This would explain why Beaumont never
asserted any claim to the land located under it, although it
subsequently became so valuable.
Be all this as it may, it is clear that Johnson, either as
owner of the certificate or as an agent employed for locating
it, and as such having, according to usage, an interest in the
lands to be surveyed, was fully authorized to make the location
under it which he did make, and to take possession of the
lands either for his own use (if he was the owner) or for the
use and benefit of himself and the actual owner, and that
his title and possession thus acquired was good against all the
world, except those who could produce a better title than that
which the certificate and the location under it secured. The
legal title, it is true, was in Rutledge's heirs, but the equitable
title was in Johnson, (if he did in fact purchase the certificate,)
and, in any event, one-third of such equitable title belonged
to hin, as the authorized locator of the certificate, and the
residue was in his hands and possession for the use of the
owners whom he represented. The location and survey were
good as against the State, and all other persons claiming by
inferior title. E. lvf. Daggett as purchaser from Johnson, and
obtaining possession from him, and the defendants as successors of Daggett, became entitled to the benefit of the Rutledge
survey as a protection against all persons claiming under a
title inferior thereto.
But this is not the whole case. There are other points wich
go to fortify the position of the defendants, which it is proper
to notice.
After the Childress certificate was located by Dr. Worrall
in 1868, E. M. Daggett, who had then been in possession under
the Rutledge title for the space of fourteen years, purchased
in, as he supposed, the entire Childress claim. In 1868 or
1869 George R. Childress, the second son of John Ohildress,
appeared at Fort Worth, having returned from California,
where he had been residing for many years. He did not know

that his brother John was living, but supposed him dead, and
that he, George, was his father's sole heir. He claimed the
land in question, and Daggett compromised with him for
about three hundred dollars, and George gave a deed selling
and relinquishing all his right and title to Daggett in fee, with
a general warranty agamst himself, his heirs, and all others..
He afterwards went to Austin, saw Green, learned of his
brother's being alive, and confirmed the arrangement made
by the latter with Green, who acted therein for the benefit
of Dr. Worrall.
In September, 1869, Daggett also compromised the claim
of Dr. Worrall and procured a deed from him and his wife,
Adaline S. Worrall. This deed is m the usual form of deeds
of bargain and sale.. It is dated 30th of September, 1869,
recites a consideration of three hundred dollars, conveys to
Daggett the land m dispute by metes and bounds, as in the
Childress patent, and recites that the land was the separate
property of the said Adaline S. Worrall, referring to the deeds
from John W Childress to Green and from Green to the said
Adaline. The deed concluded with this habendam and warranty, to wit "To have and to hold to him, the said E. M,.
Daggett, his heirs and assigns forever, free from the just claam
or claims of any and all persons whomsoever, claiming or to
claim the same." The deed was acknowledged before a notary
public, and a certificate of said acknowledgment was made
in due form, with one exception, it contains no statement that
Adaline S. Worrall, the wife, was privily examined by the
officer apart from her husband. This is necessary in order to
validate a conveyance of the wife's separate property in Texas,
and its absence cannot be supplied by showing that she was
actually privily examined. Berry v Donley, 26 Texas, 37,
FitzgeraMd v. Turner, 43 Texas, 79, Xooney v Adamson, 48
Texas, 619, Johnson v Bjan, 62 Texas, 623. To the same
effect see Ailliott v Pewso, 1 Pet. 328, 340, ffitz v enk8,
123 'U S. 291, 303. This seems to be a fatal defect, and it is
on this defect that the complainants in the cross-bills rely
Their position is, that the land was Mrs. Worrall's separate
property, that she never executed any conveyance of it accord-

iug to law, and that it was hers when she died in November,
1870, and descended, one-half 'to her husband, Dr. I. R. Worrall, and one-half to her brothers and sisters, represented by
William Dunlap and others. The complainants in the other
cross-bill, Martha IR.Worrall and others, claim the other half
-of the property as heirs of Dr. Worrall, being his mother and
his brothers and sisters. They contend that Dr. Worral had
no interest to convey when he executed the deed with his wife
in 1869, and hence the one-half part which he inherited from
his wife in November, 1870, was unaffected by that conveyance. It is true, if the deed contained a warranty, he would
be estopped from claiming the land, but it is contended that
the clause above recited does not amount to a warranty It
has been decided, however, by the Supreme Court of Texas
that words substantially such as those contained in the deed
do import a general warranty In -Rowe v. H-eath, 23 Texas,
614, the following words were so construed, to wit "For
him the said R. H., his heirs and assigns, to have and to hold
forever, as his own right, title and property, free from the
claim or claims of me, my heirs, or creditors, and all other
persons whomsoever, to claim the same or any part thereof
lawfully" In our judgment the deed of Worrall and his wife
did contain a general warranty, and the one-half part of
Adaline S. Worrall's interest which descended to Dr. Worrall
was carried by estoppel to Daggett when Dr. Worrall inherited the same from his wife.
The other questions arise on the statute of limitations. The
defendants pleaded the limitations of three years and of five
years, and also peaceable possession for thirty years. The act
of February 5th, 1841, first created the limitations referred to.
The 15th section created that of three years, declaring that
"Every suit., to be instituted to recover real estate, as against
him, her or them, in possession under title, or color of title,
shall be instituted within three years next after the cause of
action shall have accrued, and not afterwards," not computing the duration of disability from minority, coverture or insanity; and by title meaning regular claim of transfer from or
under the sovereignty of the soil, also reserving the right of
the government.

OCTOBER TERM, 1889.
Opinion of the Court.

The 16th section created the limitation of five years, declaring that "He, she or they -ho shall have had five years
like peaceable possession of real estate, cultivating, using or
enjoying the same, and paying tax thereon, if any, and claiming under a deed, or deeds, duly registered, shall be held to
have full title, precluding all claims, but shall not bar the government," and saving disabilities for non-age, coverture or
insanity
Now supposing that the prerogative of the government prevented the statute from running until after the patent issued
to the heirs of John Childress m June, 1868, it certainly commenced to run at that tune against those who claimed under
the patent, and the facts present a strong case of adverse
possession on the part of E. MV.Daggett and his grantees.
They were in full, continuous and peaceable possession for a
period, altogether, of thirty years, namely, from 1854 to 1885,
when William Dunlap and others appeared as intervenors in
this suit, and from 1854 to 1886, when the Worralls intervened.
This possession was complete in the use, cultivation and enjoyment of the land in dispute, and the payment of taxes thereon.
It was claimed and exercised under a regular deed of conveyance from M. T. Johnson, dated 23d June, 1855, which
granted and conveyed, not only the certificate of Rutledge, but
the land located under it, describing and identifying the same,
and whicl was duly registered in the records of Tarrant County
on the -30th of M[arch, 1857. It isdifficult to see why the plea
of limitation of five years at least is not a good bar against the
heirs of Adaline S. Worrall. She died November 4th, 1870,
and one-half of her estate descended to her husband, I. R.
Worrall, who survived to the 22d September, 1871. The statute having commenced to run against him, was not suspended
by his death, and had been running more than fourteen
years at the commencement of the suit. The other half of
Adaline S. Worrall's estate descended to her brother, John
Cook, and her two sisters, Alizannah, wife of William Dunlap,
and M\'atilda, wife of Dr. Jonas Fell. John Cook was living
at Adaline's death, and survived to August, 1873. The sisters
were married women when Adaline S. Worrall died, but as
