Syllabus.
that the La Grange Iron and Steel Company,-.to which the
bonds were issued, was "a private manufacturing company,
formed and established for the purpose of carrying on and operating a rolling-mill," and "was a strictly private enterprise,
formed and prosecuted for the purpose of private gain, and
which had nothing whatever of a public character." The ordinance referred to shows that the mill was to manufacture railroad iron; but that is no more i public use than the manufacture of iron bridges, as in the Topeka Case, or the making of
blocks of stone or wood for paving streets. There can -be no
doubt, therefore, that the act of the legislature of Missouri is
unconstitutional, and that the bonds, expressed to be issued in
pursuance of that act, are void upon their face.
As for this reason the action cannot be maintained, it is
needless to dwell upon the point that the. answer demurred to,
besides- the special defence of the unconstitutionality of the act,
contains a general denial of the allegations in the petition.
That point was mentioned and passed over in the opinion of
the Circuit Court, and was not alluded to in argument here, the
parties in effect assuming the general denial in the answer to
have been withdrawn or waived, and the case submitted for
decision upon the validity of the special defence.

A statute of a State, auth'orizing any person to erect and maintain on his own
land a water mill and mill-dam upon and across any stream not navigable,
paying to the owners of lands flowed daniages assessed in a judicial proceeding, does not deprive them of their property without due process of
law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the

United States.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Statement of Facts.

This was a -writ of error to reverse a judgment of the
Supreme Court of the State of New Hampshire against the
plaintiff in error, upon a petition filed, by the defendant in
error (a corporation eatablished by the laws of New Hamsphire
for the manufacture of cotton,' woolen, iron and other materials) for the assessment of damages for the flowing of his
land by its mill-dam at Amoskeag Falls on the :Merrimack
River, under the general mill act of that State of 1868, ch.
20, which is copied in the margin.*
* A, ACT for the Encouragement of Manufactures.
1. Any person, or any corporation authorized by its charter so to do,
may erect and maintain on his or its own land, or upon land of another
with his consent, a water mill, and dam to raise the water for working it, or
for creating a reservoir of water, and for equalizing the flow of the same, for
its use and of mills below, upon and across any stream not navigable, upon
the terms and conditions, and subject to the regulations, hereinafter expressed.
SECT. 2. If the land of any person shall be overflowed, drained, or otherwise
injured by the use of such dam, and said damage or injury shall not, within
thirty days after due notice thereof, be satisfactorily adjusted by the party
erecting or maintaining said dam, either party may apply by petition to the
Supreme Judicial Court, in the county or counties where such damage or
grievance arises, to have the damage, that may have been or may be'dons.
thereby, assessed ; which petition shall set out the title and description of the
premises damaged, the right by reason whereof said grievance arises, the location of the dam and extent of the damages that may be occasioned thereby; and
said court, after reasonable notice to all persons interested, shall, unless the
parties agree upon the judgment that shall be rendered, refer said petition to
a committee of three disinterested persons to be appointed by said court, to
determine in relation to the matters set forth'therein.
SECT. 8. The committee shall give such notice to the parties as shall be
qrdered by said court ; shall hear the parties and view the premises ; and, if
they shall be of opinion that the flowing or draining of said land, to the depth
and extent that the same may or can be flowed..by said dam, is or may be of
public use or benefit to the people of this Statr. and that the same is necessary
for the use of the mill or mills for which said dam was designed, they shall
estimate the damages, and make report to the said court at the next term
thereof after said view and estimate. Upon the return of the report of said
committee, -any person interested therein may object to the acceptance of'the
same for any irregularity or improper conduct of said committee; and said
court may set aside said report for any just and reasonable cause, and, if required,,shallinquire for itself whether the.erection of said dam is of public
use or benefit, any finding of the committee'upon that point notwithstanding;
SECT.

HEAD v. AMOSKEAG MANUFACTURING COMPANY. 11
Statement of Facts.

In the petition filed in the State court, the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company alleged that it had been authorized by its
charter, to purchase and hold real estate, and to erect thereon
such dams, canals, mills, buildings, machines and works as it
might deem necessary or useful in carrying on its manufactures
and business; 'that it had pu'rchased the land on both sides of
the Mferrimack River at Amoskeag Falls, including the river
and falls, and had there built mills, dug canals, and established
works, at the cost of several millions of dollars, and, for the purpose of making the whole power of the river at the falls available for the use of those mills, had constructed a dam across the
river; that the construction of the mills and dam, to raise the
water for working the mills, for creating a reservoir of water, and
for equalizing its flow, was of public use and benefit to the people
of the State, and necessary for the use of the mills for which
it was designed; and that Head, the owner of a tract of land,
described in the petition, and bounded by the -river, claimed
and, if the court shall be of opinion that the erection of said dam is not of
public use or benefit, the petition shall b dismissed. But if the report shall
be accepted and established, the court shall render judgment thereon, after
adding fifty per cent. to the estimate of damage ; which judgment shall be
final, and execution shall issue thereon. Before the reference of such petition
to the committee, if either party shall so elect, said court shall direAt an issue
to the jury to try the facts alleged in the said petition, and-assess the damages ; and judgment rendered on the verdict of such jury with fifty per cent.
added, shall be final, and said court may award costs to either party at its discretion.
SEcT. 4. No person or corporation shall derive any title from said proceedings, or be -discharged from any liability in relation to said premises, until he
or it has paid or tendered to the person aggrieved or damaged the amount of
such adverse judgment.
SECT. 5. This act shall in no way affect existing suits, nor any mill of other
persons lawfully existing on the same stream, nor any mill-site or mill privilege
of other persons on which a mmil-dam has been lawfully erected and used, nor
the right of any owner of such mill, mill-site or mill privilege, unless the right
-to maintain on such last mentioned site or privilege shall have been lost or defeated by abandonment or otherwise ; neither shall it affect the right cf a town
in any highway or bridge which said town may by law be liable tc keep in
repair: Provided, however, that the provisions of this act shall not be applicable to any navigable waters in this State.
SFT. 6. This act shall take effect from and after its passage. [Approved
July 8, 1868.]

damages for the bverflowing thereof by ,the -dam, which
the corporation had been unable satisfactorily to adjust; and
prayed that it 'might be determined whether the construction of the mills and dam, and the flowing, if any, of Uead's
land to the depth and extent, that itmight or could be fiOWed
thereby, were or might be of putlic use or benefit to 'th(r.pe-6le
of the State, and whether thef'wfe necessary for thl imws,-and
that damages, past or future, to 'the land by the consti'ction
of the dam might be assessed according to the statuteAt successive stages of the proceedings, by demurrer,, by request to the court after the introduction of the evidende upon
a trial by jury, and by motion in arrest of judgment, Head
objected that the statute was unconstitutional, and that the
petition could not be maintained, because they contemplated
the taking of his property for private use, in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States, which declares that no State shall deprive any: person f
property without due process of law, nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws; as well
as in violation of the Constitution of the State, the Bill of
Rights of which declares that all men have certain natural,
essential and inherent rights, among -which are the acquiring,
possessing and protecting property, and that every member of
the community has a right to be protected in the enjoyment
of his property.
His objections were overruled by the highest court of New
Hampshire; and final judgment was entered, adjudging that
the facts alleged in the petition were true, and that, upon payment or tender of the-damages assessed by the verdict, with
interest, and fifty, per cent. added, making in all the sum of
$572.43, the company have the right to erect and maintain the
dam, and to flow his laud forever to the depth 'and extent to
which it might or could be flowed or injured thereby. 56 N.

339; Olcott v. Spervisor8, 16 Wall. 678. Whether a use, is
public or private is a question of general law, not of constitutional construction ; and hence the decision of the State court
on that point in this case is entitled only to the weight of other
equally respectable courts. Hagar v. Reclamation District,

been in New Hampshire but one decision of this questk, . on
the merits, that in Great Palls Co. v. Fernald,47 N. H. 444.
This opinion is entitled to less weight than is ordinarily given
to New Hampshire decisions, because it was a friendly suit
without a vigorous defence; it rests on no historical basis;
it is inconsistent with the decisions of the same judge in
.Hount Washington Road Company Case, 35 N. H. 184, and
with the well considered case of Conord Railroadv. Greeley,
17 N. H. 47, 56 and, though since followed, doubts have
been expressed as to its correctness. So, too, courts in other
States, while sustaining similar statutes, have expressed doubts
of their validity if the question. were open. .Miller v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Argument for Plaitiff ,inError.

A lower riparian proprietor, by taking his land as a part of his
reservoir, appropriates property which may have a value far
beyond its value as land. This cannot be done, without buying it. .AfcCoy-v. Danley, 20 Penn. St. 85; Gould on Waters,
§ 210. The police power of a State to restrict the" uses to
which one mayput his own property, is quite a different thing
from the attempted grant of-a right to appropriate the property
of another. -Yunn v. .Jllinoi , 94 U. S. 113; Davson, v..New
Orlean, 96. U. S. 97, 107; Beer Company v. ffassachusetts, 97
U. S. 25, 32, 33 ; Water Works Co.v. St. Tammany Co., 4 Woods,
134; &_canabaCo. i. Chicago, 107 U. S. 679, 683. The
police p6wer proper. may be exercised.without compensation.
Eminent domain must be with compensation, and for public
useszonly, although the occasion for its exercise may be necessary regulations for health, morals, and good order in the community. The public has a right to pure air as much as to pure
waterr, and hence there doubtless may be a taking to prevent
or remove nuisances, as by draining swamps. Hagarv. 1?ecla.
mation District,111 U. S. 701. Private roads, so called, have
in general been sustained, or condemned, according as courts
-have-or have not found that the public have a right to use
them, even if not compelled to repair them. Underwood v.
Bailey, 59 N. H. 480; Proctorv. Andover, 42 N. 1j. 348, 360.
Whatever is a-public use for the exercise of eminent domain, is
a public use for the exercise of the taxing power. Renwick v.
-DavenportRailroad, 47 Iowa, 511; Bennington v. Park, 50
Vermont, 178; Talbot v. ffud8on, 16 Gray, 417 ; Commercial
Ba/nk'v. Iola, 2 Dillon, 353, 363. This rule that the .taking
must be for the use of the public, and not permissive, but of
right, has been recognized in many other cases, and is the only
one which will bear'examination. Nothing short of it is a
taking for public use. Bridge Co. v. Bridge Co., 1 Conn. 40,
,64; Bloodgood v. Railroad, 18 Wend. 9, 15; Burlington v.
Beaeley, 94: U. S.310; Mills Eminent Domain, § 287. Any
other principle -would afford no protection, as all agree that
the judiciairy cannot question the propriety of taking except
as involved in thq question whether it is for public use. The
New Hampshire statute does not, require a finding that the

HEAD v. AMOSKEAG MANUFACTURING COMPANY. 15
Opinion of the Court.
taking will be of public use, but only that it may be. Similar
mill acts have been declared void in Alabama, Georgia, Michigan, New York, Tennessee and Vermont, besides being questioned in other States. Moore v. 'Vight, 34 Ala. 311;
Loughbrige v. Hfarrie, 42 Georgia, 500; 1?yerson v. Brown,
35 Mich. 333; Hay v. Cohoe8 Co., 3 Barb. 42;
arding v.
Goodlett, 3 Yerger, 41.; Tyler v. Beacher, 44 Vermont, 648.
So even at the time of the decision in Company v. Fernald,the
weight of authority was against its correctness; and the preponderance has greatly increased since. And, finally, it is now
settled law in this court of last resort, as well as elsewhere, that
a legislature cannot authorize- taxes in aid of manufacturing
corporations; and a use that is not a public use for the imposition of taxes, is not a public use for the appropriation of property under the right of eminent domain. The very ground
upon which the power to tax in aid of manufacturing corporations is denied, is that it is'taking a part of the property of the
citizen for the private use and benefit of another. How then
can the legislature take a.much larger part, for the same use,
against the will of the owner? Allen v. Jay, 60 Maine, 124;
Cole v. La Grange, 19 Fed. Rep. 871; Englisk v. People, 96

M .JusTicE; GRAY delivered the opinion of the court. He
recited the facts as above stated, and continued:
The position that the plaintiff in error has been denied the
equal protection of the laws Was not insisted upon at the argument. The single question presented for decision is whether
he has been deprived of his property without due process of
law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It is only-as bearing upon that
questioii. that this court, upon a '%ritof error to a State court,

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Cour.

has jurisdiction to consider whether the statute conforms to
the Constitution of the State.
The charter of the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company,
which authorized'it to erect'and maintain its mills and dam,
gave it no riglht to flow the lands of others. Eadtman v.
AmoAeag .ManfacturingCo., 44 N. 1. 143. The proceedings
in'the State cqurt were had under the general mill act of New
Hampshire, which enacts that any person, or any corporation
authorized by its charter so -to do, may erect or maintain on
his or its own land a water mill and mill-dam upon any stream
not navigable, paying to* the owners of lands flowed the
damages which, -upon a petition filed in court by either party,
may be assessed, by a committee or by a jury, for the flowing
of the lands to the depth and extent to which they may or can
be flowed by the dam. N. H. Stat. 1868, ch. 20.
'The plaintiff in error contends that his property has been
taken by the State of New Hampshire for private use, and
that afiy taking-of private property for private use is without
due process of law.
The defendant in error contends that the raising of a water
power upon a running stream for manufacturing purposes is a
public use; that the statute is a constitutional regulation of the
rights of riparian owners; and that the remedy given by the
statute is due process of law.
General mill acts exist in: a great majority of the States of
the Union. Such acts, authorizing lands t1%e .taken or flowed
n inviturn, for the erection and maintenance of mills, existed
'in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and North Carolina, 'aswell
as in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, before
the Declaration of Independence; and exist at this day in each
of these States, except Maryland, where they were repealed in
1832. One passed in North Carolina in 1771 has remained
upon the statate book of Tennessee. They were enacted in
Maine, Kentucky, Missouri. and Arkansas, soon after their admission into the Union. They Were passed in Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, Wisbonsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Alabama and Florida, while they were yet Territories, and reenacted after they became States. They were also enacted

in Pennsylvania in 1803, in Connecticut in 1864, and more
recently in Vermont, Kansas, Oregon, West Virginia and
Georgia, but were afterwards repealed in Georgia. The principal statutes of the several States are collected in the margin.*

Opinion of the Court.

In most of those States, their validity has been assumed,
without dispute; and they were never adjudged to be invalid
anywhere until since 1870, and then in three States only, and
for incompatibility with their respective Constitutions. Lugk.
bridge v. Harris (1871), 42 Georgia, 500; Tyler v. Beacher
(1871), 44 Vermont, 648; Ryerson v. Brown (1877), 35 Ifichigan, 333. The earlier cases in Tennessee, Alabama and New
York, containiig dicta to the same effect, were decided upon
other grounds. Earding v. Goodlett, 3 Yerger, 40; AXemkis

which have entertained the most restricted view of the legislative power, that a grist mill which grinds for all comers, at
tolls fixed by law, is for a public use. See also Blair v. Cum"ing Cowunty, 111 U. S. 363.
But the statutes of many States are not so limited, either in
terms, or in the usage under them. In Massachusetts, for more
than half a century, the mill lacts have been extended to mills
for any manufacturing purpose. Mass. Stat. 1824, ch. 153;
Wolcott Voollen, -Manufacturing Co. v. Ujpham, 5 Pick. 292;
17 Pick. 58,65. And throughout New
Palmer Co. v. .Ferrill,
England, as well as in Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina,
Kentucky, and many of the Western States, the statutes are
equally comprehensive.
It has been held in many cases of high authority, that special
acts of incorporation, granted by the legislature for the establishment of dams to increase and improve the water power of
rivers and navigable waters, for mechanical and manufacturing
purposes, are for a public use. ScuddIer v. Trenton -Delaware

In some of those cases, the authority conferred by general
mill acts upon any owner of land upon a stream to erect and
maintain a mill on his own land and to flow the laund of others,
for manufacturing purposes, has been considered as resting on
the right of eminent domain, by reason of the advantages inuring to the public from the improvement of water power and
the promotion of manufactures. See also Hfolyoke Co. v. Lyman, 15 Wall. 500, 506, 507; Beekman v. Saratoga & Seenectady IRailroad, 3 Paige-- 45, 73; Talbot v. Hfudson, 16 Gray,
417, 426. And the validity of general mill acts, when directly
controverted, has often been upheld upon that ground, confirmed by long usage or prior decisions. Jordanv. Woodward,

Burnham, v. Thomp8on, 35 Iowa, 421.
In New Ho.mpshire, from which the present case comes, the
legislature of the Province in 1718 passed an act (for the most
part copied from the Massachusetts act of 1714), authorizing
the owners of mills to flow lands of others, paying damages
assessed by a jury. The act of 1718 continued in force
until the adoption of the first Constitution of the State in
1784, and afterwards until June 20, 11-92, and was then repealed, upon a general revision of the statutes, shortly before
the State Constitution of 1792 took effect. The provisions of
the Bill of Rights, on which the plaintiff in error relied in the
court below, were exactly alike in the two Constitutions.
Special acts'authorizing the flowing of lands upon the payment
of damages were passed afterwards from time to time; among
others, the statute of July 8, 1862, authorizing the Great Falls
Manufacturing Company to erect a dan upon Salmon Falls
River, which was adjudged by the Supreme Judicial Court of
New Hampshire in 1867, in an opinion delivered by Chief Justice Perley, to be consistent with the Constitution of that
State, because the taking authorized was for a public use.
Great -Falls .fanufacturing Co. v. Fernald,47 N. H. 444.
The statute now in question, the first general mill act passed
by the legislature of the State, was passed and took effect on July 3, 1868; was held in Ash v. Cumrmings, 50 N. H.
591, after elaborate argmnent against it, to be constitutional,
upon the ground of the decision in Great Falls .fanufactuning Co. v. _Fernald; and was enforced without question in
Portland v. .forse, 51 N. H. 188, and in Town v. Faulkner,
56 N. IT.255. In the case at bar, and in another case since,
the State court held its constitutionality to be settled by the
former decisions. Amoskeag 3fanufactuning Co. v. Head,

Opinion of the Court.
self at will, can be upheld as a taking, by delegation of the
right of eminent domain, of private property for public use, in
the constitutional sense, is so important and far reaching, that
it does not become this court to express an opinion upon it,
when not required for the determination of the rights of the
parties before it. We prefer to rest the decision of this case
upon the ground that such a statute, considered As regulating
the manner in'which the rights of proprietors of lands adjacent
to a stream may be asserted and enjoyed, with a due regard
to the interests of all, and to the public good, is within the constitutional power of the legislature.
When property, in which several persons have a conimon
interest, cannot be fully and beneficially enjoyed in its existing
condition, the law often provides a way in which they may
compel one another to submit to measuees necessary to secure
its beneficial enjoyment, making equitable compensation to
any whose control of or interest in the property is thereby
modified.
In the familiar case of land held by several tenants in common, or even by joint tenants with right of survivorship, any
one of them may. compel a partition, upon which the court, if
the land cannot be equally divided, will order owelty to be
paid, or, in many States, under statutes the constitutionality of
which has never been denied, will, if the estate is such that it
cannot be divided, either set it.off to one and order him to
compensate the others in money, or else order the whole estate
to be sold. Zing v.- Reed, 11 Gray, "490; Bentley v. 1ong

common, incapable of partition at law, may be the subject of
partition in equity, either by apportioning the time and extent
of use, or by a sale of the right and a division of the proceeds.

At the common law, as Lord Coke tells us, "If two tenants

in decay, and the one is willing to repair the same, and the

other will not, he that is willing shall have a writ de reparationefacienda; and the writ saith, ad .reparationemet sustentationer ejusdem domus tneantur; whereby it appeareth that
owners are in that case bound pro bono publico to maintain
houses and mills which are for habitation and use of men."
Co. Lit. 200 b; 4 Kent Com. 370. In the same spirit, the statutes, of Massachusetts, for a hindred and seventy-five years,
have provided that any tenant in common of a mill in need of
repair may notify a general meeting of all the owners for consultation, and that, if any-one refuses to attend, or to agree
with the majority, or to pay his share, the majority may cause
the repairs to be made, and recover his share of the expenses
out of the mill or its profits or earnings. Mass. Prov. Stat.

eighty years, have made provision for compelling the repair of
mills in such cases. Roberts v. Peavey, 7 Foster, 477, 493.
The statutes which have long existed in many States, authorizing the majority of the owners it severalty of adjacent
meadow or swamp lands to have commissioners appointed to
drain and improve the whole tract, by cutting ditches or otherwise, and to assess and levy the amount of the expense upon
all the proprietors in proportion to the benefits received, have
been often upheld, independently of any effect* upon the public health, as reasonable regulations for the general advantage
of those who are treated for this purpose as owners of a common property. Coomes v. Burt,22 Pick. 422; TV-rig t v. Boston, 9 Cush. 233, 241; S erman v. Tobey, 3 Allen, 7; Lowell v.

Opinion of the Court.
and the rules of this court, courts of admiralty, when the part-.
owners of a ship cannot agree upon her employment, authorize the majority to send her to sea, on giving security to the
dissenting minority, to bring back and restore the ship, or, if
she be lost, to pay them the value of their shares; and in such
case the minority can neither recover part of the profits of the
voyage nor compensation for the use of the ship. Abbott on

proceeds distributed among them. The Seneca, 18 Am. Jur.

But none of the cases, thus put by way of illustration,
so strongly call for the interposition of the law as the case before us.
The right to the use of running water is publici jurs,and
common to all the proprietors of the bed and banks of the
stream from its source to its outlet. Each has a right to the
reasonable use of the water as it flows past his land, not interfering with a like reasonable use by those above or below him.
One reasonable use of the water is the use of the power, inherent
in the fall of the stream and the force of the current, to drive
mills. That power cannot be used without damming up the
water, and thereby causing it to flow back. If the Wiater thus
dammed up by one riparian proprietor spread over the lands
of others, they could at common law bring successive actions
against him for the injury so done them, or even have the dam
abated. Before the mill acts, therefore, it was often impossible
for a riparian proprietor to use the water power at all, without
the sousent of those above him. The purpose of these statutes
is to enable any riparian proprietor to erect a mill and use the
water power of the stream, provided he does not interfere with
an earlier exercise by another of a like right or with any right
of the public; and to substitute, for the common-law remedies

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

-of repeated actions for damages and prostration of the dam,"a
new form of remedy, by which any one whose land is flowed
can have assessed, once for all, either in a gross sum or by way
of annual damages, adequate compensation for the injury.
This view of the principle upon which general mill acts rest
has been fully and clearly expounded in the judgments delivered by Chief Justice Shaw in the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts.
In delivering the opinion of the court in a case decided in
1832, he said: "The statute of 1196 is but a revision of a former law, and the origin of these regulations is to be found in
the provincial statute of 1714. They are somewhat at variance
with that absolute right 'of dominion and enjoyment which
every proprietor is supposed by law to have in his own soil;
and in ascertaining their extent it will be useful to inquire 'into
the principle upon which they are founded. We think they will
be found to rest for their justification, partly upon the interest which the community at large has in the use and employment of mills, and partly upon the nature of the property, which
is often so situated that it could not be beneficially used without the aid of this power. A stream of water often runs
through the lands of several proprietors. One may have a sufficient mill-site on his own land, with ample space'on his own
land for a mill-pond or reservoir, but yet, from the operation
of the well-known physical law that fluids will seek and find a
level, he cannot use his own property without flowing the
water back more or less on the lands of some other proprietor.
We think the power given by statute was intended to apply to
such cases, and that the legislature meant to provide that, as
the public interest in such case coincides with that of the mill-.
owner, and as the mill-owner and the owner of lands to be
flowed cannot both enjoy their full rights, without some interference, the latter shall yield to the former, so far that the former may keep up his mill and head of water, notwithstanding
the damage done to the latter, upon payment of an equitable
compensation for the real damage sustained, to be ascertained
in the mode provided by the statut6." "From this view of
the object and purpose of the statute, we think it quite mani-

HEAD v. AMOSKEAG MANUFACTURING COMPANY. 25
Opinion of ihe Court.
fest that it was designed to provide for the most useful and
beneficial occupation and enjoyment of natural streams and
watercourses, where the absolute right of each proprietor to
use his own land and water privileges, at his own pleasure, cannot be fully enjoyed, and one must of necessity, in some degree, yield to the other." Fiske v. Framingham Man ufacturing Co., 12 Pick. 68, 70-72.
In another case, decided almost twenty years later, he said:
"The relative rights of land-owners and mill-owners are founded
on the established rule of the common law, that every proprietor, through whose territory a current of water flows, in its
course towards the sea, has an equal right to the use of it, for
all reasonable and beneficial purposes, including the power of
such stream for driving mills, subject to a like reasonable and
beneficial use, by the proprietors above him and below him, on
the same stream. Consequently, no one can deprive another
of his equal right and beneficial use, by corrupting the stream,
by wholly diverting it, or stopping it from the proprietor below
him, or raise it artificially, so as to cause it to flo'w back on the
land of the proprietor above. This rule, in this Commonwealth,
is slightly modified by the mill acts, by the well-known provision, that when a proprietor erects a dam on his own land,
and the effect is, by the necessary operation of natural laws,
that the water sets back upon some land of the proprietor
above, a consequence which he may not propose as a distinct
purpose, but cannot prevent, he shall not thereby be regarded
as committing a tort, and obliged to prostrate his dam, but may
keep up his dam, paying annual or gross damages, the equitable assessment of which is provided for by the acts. It is not
a right to take and use the land of the proprietor above, against
his will, but it is an authority to use his own land and water
privilege to his own advantage and for the benefit of the community. It is a provision by law, for regulating the rights of
proprietors, on one and the same stream, from its rise to its
outlet, in a manner best calculated, on the whole, to promote
and secure their common rights in it." Bates v. Weymouth Irron
Co., 8 Cush. 548, 552, 553.
Other opinions of Chief Justice Shaw illustrate the same view.

Upon principle and authority, therefore, independently of
any weight due to the opinions of the courts of New Hampshire and other States, maintaining the validity of general mill
acts as taking private property for public use, in the strict constitutional meaning of that phrase, the statute under which the
Amoskeag Manufacturing Company -has flowed the land in
question is clearly valid as a just and reasonable exercise of the'
power of the legislature, having regard to the public good, in a
more general s6nse, as well as to the rights of the riparian proprietors, to regulate the use of the water power of running
streams, which without some such regulation could not be beneficially used. The statute does not authorize new mills to be
erected to the detriment of existing mills and mill privileges.
And by providing for an assessment of full compensation to the
owners of lands flowed, it avoids 'the difficulty which arose in
the case of Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166.
Being a constitutional exercise of legislative power, and providling a suitable remedy, by trial in the regular course of justice, to recover compensation for the injury to the land of the
plaintiff in error, it has not deprived him of his property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Walker v. Sauvinet, 92 U. S. 90; Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97;
