CHICAGO & NORTHWESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY v. CRANE.
IN

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA.
Submitted January 28, 1885.-Decided March 2,1885.

The D. & Al. Railroad Company, an Iowa Corporation, received from a township in Iowa, in consideration of its agreement to construct and maintain
a railroad to a city in the township, the proceeds of a special tax and a conveyance of a large amount of swamp lands. It constructed the railroad,
and, after operating it for a time, leased it to the C. & N. Railway Company, an Illinois corporation. The latter company changed the line and
made it avoid the city, constructing a branch to the latter. A tax-payer
and resident in the township, on behalf of himself and all other resident
voters, tax-payers and property holders, commenced suit in a State court of
Iowa against both companies, praying for a peremptory writ of mandamus
to compel the reconstruction and operation of the 6]d line. To this the
defendants filed a joint demurrer, and a joint answer, setting out further
matter in defence. On motion of the Illinois company the suit was removed to the Circuit Court of the United States, as a controversy wholly
between it and citizens of Iowa, in which the Iowa company had no interest. Act of March 3, 1875, ยง 2, 18 Stat. 471. Held, That the Iowa corporation was a necessary party for the determination of the controversy, and
the removal was improperly made.
An act authorizing a railroad company to lease its railroad to another corporation, and requiring the corporation lessee to be'liable in the same rmanner
as though the railway belonged to it, imposes a liability as to the leased
property upon the company lessee while operating it; but does not discharge the company lessor from its corporate liabilities.

This was a suit begun in the Circuit Court of the State of
Iowa for Polk County- by the defendant in error, described
in the petition as a resident, tax-payer and property-holder
of Polk City, Madison Township in that county, suing for
himself and all other resident voters, tax-payers and propertyholders of that city and township. The defendants were the
Des Moines and Minneapolis Railroad Company, a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of Iowa, and the plaintiff
in error, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, a
corporation organized and existing by virtue of the laws of
Illinois, doing business and operating a railroad within the
State of Iowa.

CHICAGO & N. W. RAILWAY v. CRANE.
Statement of Facts.

It was set. out inthe petition that the object of the Ds
Moines and Minneapolis Railroad Company was to construct
and operate a line of railroad from the city of Des Moines, in
Polk County, Iowa, to the State line in the direction of Minnesota; that prior to August, 1870, that corporation had surveyed and located the line of its road from the city of Des
Moines, in Polk County, through said county via Polk City, in
Madison Township, and was proceeding to construct the same;
that, to aid it in the construction of its road as thus located, a
special tax of three per cent. on the taxable property in Madison Township, under the existing assessment of said property,
was voted to said company upon the condition that its railroad
should be constructed and operated from the city of Des
Moines, in Polk County, via Polk City, to Ames, in Story
County; that the company did construct its railroad~ accordingly, and operated the same, making Polk City a station on
its main and continuous line between said points, and thereupon
the said tax was levied, collected and paid to the company in
accordance with the vote, and amounted to about $17,000;
that in 1874, Polk County, through its board of supervisors
and according to law, conveyed to said company all the swamp
lands of said county, amounting to about fifteen thousand
acres, on the same condition, that the- railroad should be constructed and operated from the city of Des Moines through
Polk County via Polk City, and that said company accepted
the grant; and that many citizens of Polk City and Madison
Township subscribed and paid for stock in said company upon
the same condition.
It was further alleged in the petition that said railroad was
coustructed and operated on the original line through Polk
City, which was the largest and most important station on the
railroad between Des Moines and Ames; that in the year 1879
the defendant, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, leased the said line of railroad and came into possession
of all the franchises and privileges of the Des Moines and Minnesota Railroad Company, and has changed the line and location
of said railroad, and has built and is now operating its main
line of road about two miles east of Polk City, on an entirely

different line from that upon which it was originally constructed, and in violation of its obligations a~nd duty, contrary
to the terms and conditions upon which the said taxes were
voted, the said swamp lands conveyed, and said stock sub.
scriptions made, and to the damage and injury of the citizens
and property-owners in Polk City.
The prayer of the petition was as follows:
"Wherefore plaintiff demands that defendants be required
to reconstruct and operate the main lin6,of said railroad upon
the line originally constructed, running from the city of Des
Moines, in Polk County, Iowia, north, v Polk City, to Ames,
in Story County, Iowa, making Polk City a station on the said
main. and continuous line of railroad from the city of Des
Moines. Iowa, to Ames, Iowa, and that the same be constructed
and operated in full compl%gpe with the terms and conditions
upon which the-taxes were voted and paid, swamp lands conveyed, and subscriptions-paid as aforesaid, and prays a peremptory writ of mandamus, commanding the said defendants
to forthwith comply with the above demands, and for such
other remedy and relief as may be lawful and proper in the
premises."
To this petition there was filed a joint demurrer, and also a
joint answer, on 3une 8, 1883. In the answer, among other
things, the following matter of defence was set out:
"And for further answer and defence to plaintiff's petition
defendants say: About the year 1819 the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company leased the Des Moines and Minneapolis Railroad, then constructed and in operation from th
city of Des Moines via Polk City tQ Ames, and thence north to
Story. City, in Story County, a distance of about (58) fifty-eight
miles, and during the said year the Chicago and Northwestern
Railway Company bedame the owner of all the stock, franchises,
and privileges of the Des Moine's and Minneapolis Railroad
Company, and has .ever since and now owns, holds, and controls
the same, and operates said railway as a part of the system of
the' Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company.
"At the time of the construction of said railway and the
acquisition of the same by the Chicago and Northwestern Rail-

Statement of Facts,

way Company said railroad between Des Moines and Story
City was a narrow-gauge road, and during the years 1880 and
1881 the defendant, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway
Company, changed the gauge to a standard gauge, relaid the
same with new steel rails and ties, making the same a first-class
road.
"The narrow-gauge road was not a first-class road in any
respect, very little grading having been done, and running
mainly over the top of the ground, with the surface nearly in.
its natural and native condition, there being very few cuts and
very few fills, and the road, as a whole, as it then existed, was
of very little benefit to 'any towns along it or to the company
which owned it, and the road was wholly unable to earn operating expenses and a reasonable interest upon its cost.
"The Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company extended
the line from Story City to Jewell Junction, and thence north
through Webster City, Eagle Grove, Algona, and to the State
line north at Elnore, where the same connects with a through
line, now controlled and operated by the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, known as the Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Paul and Omaha Railroad, thus making a through and
continuous line, and very direct from the city of Des Moines
to the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The said road is
built and constructed as a -first-class road, with steel rails and
eLsy gradients, and is capable of and is doing a large amount
of through business and traffic.
"These-defendants say that, with a view to making such a
first-class road, it becomes absolutely essential and necessary to
change the line so the same should run about two miles 6r two
miles and a half east of Polk City, in order to avoid a very
heavy grade of about 85 feet to the mile for three miles, going
down into Polk City, and about the same distance and grade
going out of it.
"The grade is not only very heavy, but the curves necessarily very great, and an engine capable of hauling 25 to 30-cars
on the present line as constructed east of Polk City could only
haul, at most, ten to twelve cais over the line via Polk City.
"In view of this condition of affairs and the impracticability

of operating the road through Polk City, the Chicago and
Northwestern Railway Company, in the summer of 1880, made
overtures to the people of Polk City to change the line to its
present location.
"After many conferences and public meetings in the town
of Polk City, the citizens of said town agreed with the Chicago
and Northwestern Railway Company, that if said company
would build a broad-gauge road from a point about two miles
northeast of Polk City into the town, and change the location
of their depot to a point more convenient for the citizens of Polk
City to do business, both as to passengers and freight; to run
two passenger trains from the main line to Polk City on their
way from Des Moines to Ames, two mixed passenger and freight
trains each day; move all freight promptly, with no greater
charge for freight or passengers than if Polk City were on the
main line; would also build and maintain good and sufficient
stock yards in the vicinity of the depot in Polk City, to accommodate all shippers, &c.; would transport free all the material
from Chicago, or any other point west of that place, to build a
bridge over the Des Moines River; would pay the sum of
$1,000 in money towards the building of said bridge, besides
such transportation; and if the company would further perform,
all and singular, the stipulations and agreements set out in a
certain contract made between the citizens and tax-payers of
Polk City and Polk County and the Chicago and Northwestern
Railway Company, dated on the 2d day of September, 1880, as
shown by a copy of said contract hereto annexed and made a
part of this answer, then and in that case it should be lawful
and proper for the defendants to change such line of railway
and take up the narrow-gauge running into Polk City.
"1Said contract was made and signed by thirty-five of the
principal tax-payers and residents and business men of Polk*
City and Madison Township, as appears by the said copy annexed.
"In pursuance of the said contract the main line of the defendant's road was changed, as alleged in plaintiff's petition, at
an expense to defendant of $15,000, and as herein admitted,
and the narrow-gauge- track, from a point about three miles

was then and there, during the year 1881, taken up and a broadgauge built into said Polk City, as provided by said agreement,
and from that time hitherto and, now, the defendant, the Chicago
and Northwestern Railway, has operated a broad-gauge road
into Polk City, in all respects in accordance with the contract
herein referred to.
"And these defendants aver that said contract was made

Polk, in the State of Iowa, were each and. all well acquainted
and had knowledge of the said contract, and all that has been
done thereunder, and acquiesced and consented thereto and
therein.
"And defendants aver that the citizens of Polk City and
of Madison Township and Polk County, acquiesced and made
no objections to the taking up of said narrow-gauge track, and
the laying down of the broad gauge, and the building of the
new depot and stock-yards.
"And these defendants further say that by reason of the said
contract, and in compliance with the conditions of the same by
the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, the citizens,
voters, and tax-payers of Madison Township and Polk City and
Polk County, have been greatly benefited, and the town of Polk
City placed upon a through line of railway, much more advantageous to them in all business respects than the narrow-gauge
railway as built and located through their town.
"The defendants further state that the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company has become and is the sole owner
of the stock and road and franchises of the Des Moines and Minneapolis Railroad Company, and that the latter-named company
has no longer any interest therein, and has no interest in the
subject of litigation mentioned in the plaintiff's petition; that
in case any relief can or may be granted to the plaintiff or any
other person, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company
will be solely liable to perform and execute any and all orders
of the court in respect thereto, and that said Chicago and
Northwestern Railway Company is entirely solvent, and able

"Wherefore defendants say that the plaintiff, thetown of Polk
City, and Madison Township, and the county of Polk, are each
and all forever estopped, by reason of the matters hereinbeforeยฐ
stated, to claim or demand the relief prayed by the plaintiff, or
any relief whatever, by reason of the change of the line of railways hereinbefore set forth."
On the same day, June 8, 1883, the Chicago aim'-Northwestem Railway Company filed its petition for the removal of the
cause to the Circuit Court of the United States. After setting
out that the matter and amount in dispute, exclusive of costs,
exceeded the sum or value of $500, and that the petitioner was
a corporation and citizen of Illinois, the petition proceeded as
folloivs: -

"That your petitioner's co-defendant, the Des Moines and
Minneapolis Railway Company, is merely a nominal party in
this suit, for the reason that your petitioner is the owner of all
the stock and franchises of the Des Moines and Minneapolis
Railway Company, and is the lessee of said railway in perpetuity, charged with the duty of operating said railway, and subject to the payment of all claims or demands of every nature
and kind made against said Des Moines and Minneapolis Railway Company, and your petitioner will be solely liable to obey
any order made in this cause, and to perform any judgment
rendered; that the controversy in this case is wholly between
the plaintiff and the defendant, the Chicago and Northwestern
Railway Company, who are citizens of different States, and
which controversy can be fully determined as between them
without the presence of the Des Moines and Minneapolis Railway Company; that your petitioner is the only defendant
actually interested in such controversy; that the plaintiff,
Emanuel 1T. Crane, was at and before the time of bringing this
suit, and at all times since has been, and still is, a citizen of the
State of Iowa and a resident thereof."

To reverse that order and judgment this writ of error was
prosecuted.
Yr. -. X Hubardfor plaintiff in error.-It is averred and
shown in the answer that the Chicago and Northwestern
Railway Company owned a connecting line and leased the Des
Moines and Minneapolis road under and by virtue of the
statute above quoted. The fact of the leasing of the road and
transferring of all the franchises and possession to the Chicago
and Northwestern Railway Company is alleged in plaintiff's
petition as well as by defendants, and this shows that the
Minneapolis company. is unable to respond to a mandamus.
High, Extraordinary Remedies, ยง 484; .Mitchell v. Speer, 39
Geo. 56; Dodd v. .Miller, 14 Ind. 433; Rice v. Walker, 44
Iowa, 458. The substantive ground of action for the plaintiff
for his mandamus is, that the defendants are violating an implied contract to operate the narrow-gauge road, because Polk
City and Madison township gave a three per cent. tax and the
swamp land, on condition tha: the road should be built and
operated through Polk City. But mere contract obligations
cannot be enforced by mandamus. High, Extraordinary Remedies, ยง 321; State v. Tu7pike Co., 16 Ohio St. 308; Queen
v. Hull & Selby Railway Co., 6 Q. B. 70. At the common
law, the mandamus proceeding was not an action proper, nor
was it a writ of right, but a prerogative writ obtained on an
:nformation under oath showing good cause for its issuance.
Under the Code of Iowa, however, mandamus is an ordinary
ction at law, triable as nearly as may be like an ordinary
ration for the recovery of damags, and is not triable de novo
m the Supreme, Court like an equitable action. Dove v.
Indpendent SchooZ .District of .Yeokuk, 41 Iowa, 689. The
statute on this subject is, Code, ยง 3379: "The pleadings
and other proceedings in any action in which a mandamus is
clamed shall be the same in all respects as nearly as may be,
and costs shall be recovered by either party, as in an ordinary
ration for the recovery of damages." The definition given of

an action of mandamus by our statute is contained in ยง 3373,
as follows: "The action of mandamus is one brought in a court
of competent jurisdiction, to obtain an order of such court
commanding an inferior tribunal, board, corporation, or person,
to do or not to do an act, the performance or omission of
which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust,
or stations"

. . .

GatcA for appellee.

Mn. JUsTIcE MATTHEWS delivered the opinion of the court.
He recited the facts as above stated, and continued:
The right of removal from the State court, which is contested
in this case, is founded on the last clause of the second section
of the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, Richardson's Supplement, 173: "And when in any suit mentioned in this section
there shall be a controversy which is wholly between citizens
of different States, and which can be fully determined as
between them, then either one or more of the plaintiffs or defendants actually interested in such controversy may remove
said suit into the Circuit Court of the United States for the
proper district."
It is accordingly argued in its support that the sole and real
controversy disclosed by the pleadings is between the plaintiff
below and the plaintiff in error, to which the Des Moines and
Minneapolis Railroad Company is a merely nominal party.
The action, it is said, is brought in pursuance of ยง 3373 of
the Iowa Code, which is as follows:
"Tha action of mandamus is one brought in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain an order of such court commanding"
an inferior tribunal, board, corporation or person to do or not
to do an act, the performance or omission of which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station."
And by ยง 3379, it is further provided, that "the pleadings
and other proceedings in any action in which a mandamus is
claimed, shall be the same in all respects as nearly as may be,
and costs shall be recovered by either party as in an ordinary
action for the recovery of damages."

CHICAGO & N. W. RAILWAY v. CRANE.
Opinion of the Court.

It is also declared, in ยง 3315, that "the plaintiff in any
action, except those brought for the recovery of specific real
or personal- property, may also, as an auxiliary relief, have an
order of mandamus to compel the performance of a duty
established in such action. But if such duty, the performance
of which is sought to be compelled, is not one resulting from
an office, trust or station, it must be one for the breach of
which a legal right to damages is already complete at the commencement of the action, and must also be a duty of which a
court of equity would enforce the performance."
The proposition that the Des Moines and Minneapolis Railroad Company is a merely nominal and not a real and substantial party to the controversy, is maintained on two
grounds:
1. That the relief sought against it rests upon the force of
the alleged agreements in reference to the location of its line,
which constitute the conditions of the taxes voted, lands
granted, and stock subscriptions paid to it, and that mandamus
will not lie for the purpose of enforcing the specific performance of personal contracts. 2. And that the Des Moines
and Minneapolis Railroad Company is not only exonerated but
disabled from the performance of the duty sought to be enforced against it, if for such it were amenable to the process of
mandamus, by virtue of the lease of its road, property and
franchises to the plaintiff in error, that lease being authorized
by ยง 1300 of the Code of Iowa, as follows:
"Any such corporation may sell or lease its railway property
and franchises, or make joint running arrangements with any
corporation owning or operating any connecting railway, anql
the corporation operating the railway of another shall, in all
respects, be liable in the same manner and extent as, though
such railway belonged to it, subject to the laws of this State."
But to sustain the first point, it is necessary to decide the
controversy in favor of the Des Moines and Minneapolis Railroad
Company, one of the defendants sought to be charged, upon
its merits. That necessarily affirms that such a controversy
exists; and that, in its turn, proves that the Circuit Court did
not err in holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain it.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

It may be a question whether the remedy by mandamus'is
not larger and more extensive under the iowa Code than the
plaintiff in error admits. And, at any rate, we cannot strike
from-the record parts of the plaintiff's case as immaterial without assuming the point to be proved, that we have a right to
consider its merits at all, for wheth6r-they are material may be
the substance of the controversy. It may well be that the
pcope of the plaintiffs case includes the claim that the railway
company, having, on the faith of the alleged agreements, made
a location of its line, exhausted its corporate power in reference
to its establishment; or that, even if it still had corporate discretion to change it, the circumstances alleged, including the
agreements made .on condition of its original location, may not
have created a corporate duty enforceable by mandamus, to
maintain and permanently operate it. These are questions,
certainly, which. the plaintiff in the action has the right to
raise and have tried in any !ourt of his own selection, having
proper jurisdiction; and they raise a controversy with the Des
Moines and Minneapolis Railroad Company, to which it is a necessary party, unless it is relieved from it by the substitution, in
its place, of its lessee, by the law under which it transferred its
property and franchises to the plaintiff in error.
But that section of the statute already quoted has no such
effect. It does not discharge the lessor company from any of
its corporate liabilities. It merely imposes a liability upon the
lessee while operating it. And if this liability extends, as is
claimed, to obligations of the lessor antecedent to the lease,
such as that sought to be enforced in the present proceeding,
there is nothing in the' statute to exclude the idea that it is a
joint liability, enforceable against both.
If it be said that the liability i that of the lessor, but that it
is disabled by the lease from is performance, and that that
duty is cast by the lease and the law upon the lessee, then the
necessity for a joinder in the action is still more apparent. For
to obtain a judgment against the plaintiff in error, requiring it
to perform a duty devolved upon it merely because it has assumed under the law to perform the duties of another, makes
it necessary, upon well-settled rules of pleading, also to obtain

PRENTICE v. STEARNS.
Statement of Facts.

a judgment against the latter to declare and determine with
conclusive force the existence and limits of the duty to be enforced against its guarantor and substitute.
In any view we are justified in taking of the nature of the
controversy disclosed by the pleadings in this proceeding, we
conclude that both the original defendants are necessary parties to its determination, and that, consequently, the plaintiff
in error was not entitled to remove the suit from the jurisdiction of the State court.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is accordingly

AJ/irmed.

ERROR TO THE CRoUIT COURT OF THE UTED STATES FOR THE
DXSTRICT OF MaiNESOTA.
Submitted January9, 1885.-Decided March 2.1885.

In the absence of a bill of exceptions, setting forth evidence, no error can be
assigned in respect to facts found by the court when the parties waive a
trial by jury.
In a suit at law to recover possession of realestate the court cannot take note
of facts, which, in equity, might afford ground for relieving the plaintiff,
by reforming the description in his deed.
A. deed from an Indian chief to A, in 1856, of a tract described by metes.
and bounds, and further as "being the land set off to the Indian Chief
'Buffalo ' at the Indian Treaty of September 80, 1854, and was afterwards
dis' osed of by said Bvffalo to said A, and is now recorded with the government documents," does not convey the equitable interest of the chief in another
tract described by different metes andbounds, granted to the said chief by
a subsequent patent in 1858, in conformity with the said treaty, in such
manner that an action at law may be maintained by A or his grantee for
recovering possession of the same.

This was an action at law to recover possession of real estate
and damages for its detention, the plaintiff in error -being
plaintiff below, and a citizen of Ohio, the defendant being a
citizen of Minnesota.
