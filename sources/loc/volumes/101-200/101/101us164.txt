board, under the law, is, in my opinion, conclusive when there
has been no fraud. As it seems to me, this case comes within
the operation of this principle.

UNITED STATES v. LAwsoN.
The act of Feb. 26, 1867 (14 Stat. 410), abolishing a former collection district in
Maryland, and forming from a portion thereof a new district, provides that
the collector "shall receive an annual salary of $1,200." A. held the office
of collector from April 19, 1867, until April 1, 1875. On July 18, 1867, the
Commissioner of Customs required him, in writing, to account for a!u
fees received by him as such. He accordingly thereafter paid them into the treasury. Held, 1. That in addition to his salary A. was entitled to the fees and
emoluments allowed to such officers by pre-existing legislation. 2. That
having paid them into the treasury pursuant to a peremptory order of his
superior officer he was not thereby precluded from recovering them in a suit
against the United States.

from the Court of Claims.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
APPEAL

Thse Sblicitor-General for the United States.
Mr. John Scott, Jr., for the appellee.
MR. JUSTICE CLIFFoRD delivered the opinion of the court.
Compensation to collectors of the customs from the organization of the government to the present time has been chiefly
derived from certain enumerated fees, commissions, and allowances, to which is added a prescribed sum, called salary, much
less than a reasonable compensation for the service required of
the officer. 1 Stat. 64, 816, 627, 786.
Sufficient appears to show that by these several acts certain
enumerated fees and commissions were made payable to the
collectors of the customs, and that they were also entitled to
certain proportions of fines, penalties, and forfeitures. By the
same acts they were required to keep accurate accounts of all
fees and official emoluments by them received, and of all expenses for rent, fuel, stationery, and clerk-hire, and to report
the same annually to the Comptroller of the Treasury, but

they were allowed to retain to their own use the whole amount
of the emoluments collected from those sources, without any'
limitation. Maximum rate of compensation was subsequently
prescribed, which was $5,000, and it was made applicable to
all collectors without any discrimination. 2 id. 172.
It was provided by that act that whenever the annual emoluments of any collector, after deducting the expenses incident
to the office, amounted to more than $5,000, the surplus should
be accounted for and paid into the treasury. Districts for
the collection of the customs were, at a later period, divided
into two classes, usually denominated the enumerated and the
non-enumerated ports, and the maximum rate of compensation
to collectors was diminished. 3 id. 695.
Under that act the maximum for the enumerated ports was
$4,000 and for the non-enumerated ports $3,000, and the provision in respect to both classes was that the excess, after deducting the expenses incident to the office, should be paid into
the treasury as public money.
For a considerable period of time these regulations were satisfactory, but when the policy was changed, the free list much
enlarged, and the rates of duty reduced, experience showed
that the emoluments of collectors from those sources were not
sufficient to give them a reasonable compensation. Temporary
expedients were resorted to for several years by the passage of
an annual compensation act, as will be seen by reference to
the acts of Congress during that period. United States v.
TFalker, 22 How. 299-308; United States v. Macdonald,5 Wall.
647, 655.
Importers, under various antecedent acts of Congress, were
allowed to place certain goods in the public stores under bond,
at their own risk, without the payment of the duties, until the
goods were withdrawn. Public stores were accordingly rented,
and as the business increased, the rent and storage received by
the collector of the merchants making deposits in the stores
exceeded the amount paid to the owners of the same, and there
was no law requiring the collector to account for the excess.
Congress interposed and regulated the subject. 5 Stat. 432;
Rev. Stat., sect. 2647.
By that enactment collectors are required to include in their

UNITED STATES V. LAWSON.

[Sup. Ot.

quarterly accounts all sums received for rent and storage in
the public stores beyond the rents which are paid to the owner,
and if the excess in any one year exceeds $2,000, it is made
their duty to pay such excess into the treasury as part and
parcel of the public money. United States v. Macdonald,
2 Cliff. 270, 282.
Two thousand dollars of the amount, under the act of Congress then in force, might be retained by the collector in addition to the amount received from other lawful sources of
emolument, provided the latter did not exceed the maximum
rate allowed to the office. Receipts from the other sources of
emolument were to be accounted for as before; but the effect
of the new provision was to add $2,000 to the compensation of
a collector, if his office earned that amount from rent and storage. Custom dues of every kind received by a collector are
now required to be credited in his quarterly accounts, no matter from what source of emolument the money is derived; and
the provision is, that whenever the emoluments of any collector,
other than one of the enumerated ports, "shall exceed $3,000,
the excess shall in every such case be paid into the treasury
for the use of the United States; but the provision does not
extend to fines, penalties, or forfeitures, or the distribution
thereof." Rev. Stat. 2691.
Apply the rule prescribed in that provision to the case before
the court, and it is clear that the collector, if the compensation
he received from other sources of emolument, after deducting
the incidental expenses of his office, amounted to $3,000, would
not have a right to retain any portion of the excess received
for rent and storage beyond what he paid to the owners of the
stores rented. His right in such a case, provided the aggregate
of his receipts from the other sources of emolument, after deducting the incidental expenses of his office, was insufficient to
give him the maximum compensation allowed, would be to retain enough from the amount derived from that source to make
up the deficit.
Judgment was rendered in favor of the petitioner, and the
United States appealed to this court. No formal assignment
of errors is filed, but the proposition submitted in argument is
that the petitioner voluntarily paid the amount claimed into

Oct. 1879.]

the treasury, and that he cannot now maintain any action to
recover it back.
Nothing appears in this case to warrant the conclusion that
the petitioner ever collected any thing for rent and storage, or
that any such matters are in controversy in this case, as will
hereafter more fully appear.
Special findings were made by the court to the effect following: That the petitioner held the office of collector of the port
of Crisfield from April 19, 1867, to April 1, 1875, and that he
received from the United States during that period a salary at
the rate of 51,200 per annum; that on the 18th of July subsequent to his appointment the Commissioner of Customs wrote
him, acknowledging the letter of the petitioner of a prior date,
and stated that the $1,200 salary given him by the act creating
his district constituted his entire compensation, and that he
was required to account for all fees.
Directions could hardly be more peremptory; and the Court
of Claims finds that in consequence of that letter the petitioner
accounted for and paid into the treasury all moneys collected
by him as duties on imports and tonnage, except what was
expended for office-rent, fuel, and expenses, and for the services
of his deputy and clerks.
During his term of office he collected as fees $9,066.43, of
which he paid out $623.48 for office-rent, fuel, and expenses,
and $2,492.29 for the services of his deputy and clerks, for
which sums he was allowed credit in his accounts.
None of these matters can be controverted; and the fifth
finding of the court below shows the balance of the sum collected as fees, to wit, the sum of $5,950.66, was by him, without protest, paid into the treasury of the United States. All
of the facts are stated in the findings of the court; and they
also find that the petitioner, under the acts of Congress, collected tonnage taxes to the amount of $11,839.23, and that he
paid the same to the government.
It appears that the district in which the petitioner is collector was formed out of a part of a district created by the
original collection act, and that it was continued as such
until the passage of the act abolishing it, and that the act
creating the new district provided that the collector of the

UNITED STATES V. LAWSON.

[Sup. ot.

same shall receive an annual salary of $1,200. 1 Stat. 33;
14 id. 410.
Much discussion of the proposition that the petitioner would
have been entitled to all he demands if he had seasonably
claimed it or made the payment, when it was officially required,
under protest, is certainly not required, as it is not denied in
argument; but if it were required to give the authority for
the conceded right, the effort would not be attended with much
difficulty. Express provision was made by the second section
of the Compensation Act, that collectors might demand and
receive the fees therein prescribed. They were also given a
salary of $250, and were required to keep an accurate account
of all fees and official emoluments and all expenditures for
rent, fuel, stationery, and clerk-hire, and to transmit the same
under oath to the Comptroller of the Treasury. 1 id. 706-708.
Corresponding provision is now contained in the Revised Statutes which is applicable to the case under consideration. Rev.
Stat., sect. 2654.
Percentages for the collection of duties of import and tonnage were also allowed by the original act, and are contained
in the Revised Statutes. Sect. 2659. Three per cent is
allowed to the collector of this port, and he is also entitled
to a salary of $200 by the original act, which for certain purposes may still be regarded as in force. Accounts are still
required to be rendered by the officer under oath. Sects.
2639, 2641.
Instances may perhaps be cited where it would be reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to make the salary of
the collector his entire compensation, by using appropriate
words to manifest such intention; but it is clear to a demonstration that the general rule is the other way, as appears from
all the compensation acts passed since the Treasury Department was organized. Salary in all the acts is one of the
allowances, but it will be found in every such act that fees,
commissions, other allowances, or percentages are also included
in the list. Proof of that proposition is found in the Revised
Statutes as well as in the acts of Congress -which were the
subject of revision. If more be needed to confirm the proposition, it will be found in the decisions of this court, to which

Oct. 1879.]

reference has already been made. It is not even suggested
that the acts of Congress allowing fees, percentages, and commissions are repealed, and, if not, it may well be that such
allowances were intended, as heretofore, to supplement the
small salaries prescribed in cases like the present.
Suppose that is so, still it is contended by the United States
that the payments were voluntarily made, and that the money
cannot be recovered back. Confessedly, the order was official
and peremptory, and under such circumstances it may well be
inferred that the party felt that, if he refused to obey, the
refusal would cost him his commission. Had he refused to
comply with the order or entered a protest, his act might
have been regarded as contumacious, and have proved as injurious in its consequences to the incumbent of the office as if he
had declined to discharge the ordinary duties of the collector.
Viewed in the light of the attending circumstances, and especially of the fact that the order came from the Commissioner of
the Customs, to whom he was immediately responsible, we cannot hold that the payments were voluntary, within the meaning
of the judicial rule which, in consequence of the payment,
denies to the party making the same the right to recover it
back.
Beyond all question, the money was wrongfully exacted, and
it is equally certain that in equity and good conscience it ought
to be returned, or so much of it as is not barred by the Statute
of Limitations. It was demanded of him by his official superior,
and the act of Congress exposed him to a penalty if he refused
to comply. 14 Stat. 187; Rev. Stat., sect. 8619.
Comment upon the plea of limitations is unnecessary, as the
charges barred by the statute were excluded from the judgment.
Governed by these views, we hold, as the court below held,
that the petitioner is entitled to recover the fees paid into the
treasury after May 22, 1869, as stated in the opinion of the
court, less 82.30 of tax paid on his salary, making, as properly
adjusted in the opinion of the court below, the sum of $5,605.38,
for which the judgment was rendered.
Judgment affirmed.
