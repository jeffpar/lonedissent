charge by the court that the master was bound to use due and
reasonable diligence furnished the general rule of law. If there
was anything in reference to his refusal to employ the tug
which made a more definite instruction proper, counsel for
defence should have asked for it. But none was prayed.
We are not able to see, therefore, any error in the charge of
the court.
A question was asked the master as to what he would have
done if the tug-boat had offered to take him up the river at the
usual rates, to which defendants objected, and the question
being permitted they excepted.
The answer is not given, and we cannot tell, therefore,
whether it was favorable to plaintiff or defendants. It is settled law, at least in this court, that under such circumstances
it is the evidence given which constitutes the error, if there be
one, and this must be shown by the answer. Nailor v. Iilliams, 8 Wall. 107.
We see no error in the record.
Judgment affirmed.

RAM-ROAD CoM-PNY v. UNITED STATES.
1. A party claiming a credit which by reason of his laches was not presented to
the accounting officers of the treasury and disallowed in whole or in part
by them cannot set it up in an action brought by the United States against
him for the recovery of a debt.
2. By the act of July 13, 1866 (14 Stat. 135, sect. 103 of the act of 1864, as
. .
.corporation owning . . . any railroad . . .engaged
amended), "every
or employed in . . . transporting the mails of the United States upon contracts made prior to Aug. 1, 1866, shall be subject to and pay a tax of
two and one half per cent of the gross receipts" from such service. In a
suit against a railroad company to recover said tax no express contract for
carrying the mails was proved, but it appeared that the company had been
carrying them, and that the services for which it had been paid commenced
before Aug. 1, 1866, and continued without interruption until Jan. 1, 1870.
Held, 1. That the law implies that a contract was entered into prior to
Aug. 1, 1866. 2. That the company is liable for that tax.
3. A railroad company paid, Aug. 1, 1870, to the holders of its bonds $61,495 as
interest then due. Held, that the company was liable to the United States
to a tax of five per cent on that amount.
4. The "tax of two and one-hall per centum on the amount of allinterest or
coupons paid on bonds or other evidences of debt issued and payable in one
or more years after date," by any railroad company, is a tax on the interest,
not as it accrues, but when it is paid.

CO. V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Eastern District of Wisconsin.
This is an action by the United States against the Western
Union Railroad Company, a corporation of Wisconsin, to recover certain internal revenue taxes alleged to have accrued
from Aug. 1, 1862, to Dec. 31, 1871. The company filed a
general denial of the allegations of the complaint, and in addition thereto set up a counter claim.
The plaintiff, to maintain the issue on its part, introduced
statements from the books of the defendant, which were admitted to be true, from which it appeared that the gross amount
of all receipts of the company for the transportation of passengers between Aug. 1, 1862, and July 1, 1864, was $190,863.68;
that its entire gross receipts from and after June 30, 1864,
until Aug. 1, 1866, were $1,427,685.36; that its gross receipts
for fares, and carrying the mails, from Aug. 1, 1866, until
Jan. 1, 1870, were $605,770.09, and that of the said last
amount $61,676.01 were for carrying the mails, and $544,094.08
for fares.
It further appeared from the books of the company, that
there were no net earnings subject to tax in this suit. There
were entries crediting the agent of its bondholders with interest on bonds of the Northern Illinois Railroad, from July
1 to Dec. 31, 1864, the sum of $38,876.00, and from Jan. 1
to Dec. 31, 1865, a like credit to him for interest on said
bonds, $33,648.54; and in the year 1866 a like credit of
$24,372.25; upon which the plaintiff claimed that it was entitled to a -tax of five per cent. - It further appeared from said
books that interest on the bonded debt to the amount of
$61,495.00 fell due Aug. 1, 1870, and was paid by the company on or after that date; that interest to the amount of
$53,767.65 on the bonded debt became payable Feb. 1, 1870,
and was paid on or after that date; and that $52,929.37 became
due and payable on the bonds Aug. 1, 1871, and was paid on
or after that date by the company.
The plaintiff, to further maintain the issue on its part, offered to show by said books that, Feb. 1, 1872, the further
sum of $52,423.71 became due and payable on the said bonds,
and was paid on or after said date, to which the defendant

objected on the ground that said evidence was incompetent aud
immaterial. The court overruled the objection and the defendant excepted. The plaintiff then showed that the sum of
$52,423.71 so became due and payable Feb. 1, 1872, and was
paid on or after that date, and claimed and insisted that the
plaintiff was entitled to a tax of two and a half per centum on
five-sixths of said amount.
The plaintiff then rested, and the defendant called as a
witness one Ranney, who testified that he was secretary and
treasurer of the company and had charge of its books and
papers, and he as their bookkeeper had charge of the books
of said company from Feb. 22, 1866; that he had examined
the company's books, papers, and files, and found therein no
reference to any contract for carrying the mails; that so far
as he could ascertain from his examination no such contract
was ever made, and that he had no knowledge thereof.
He further testified that that portion of the road between
Freeport and Savannah was known and called as the Northern
Illinois Railroad, and that the bonds mentioned as Northern
Illinois Railroad bonds were issued on that road; that said road
was a part of the road operated by the Racine and Mississippi
Railroad, and that it was consolidated with the Western Union
Railroad in January, 1866, and that all of the earnings of said
road for the whole time mentioned in the declaration are included in the books of the company; and that on the consolidation of the said company with the Western Union Railroad
Company the latter company succeeded to all its rights, privileges, franchises, and liabilities. That the entries in the books
of interest paid on bonds of Northern Illinois Railroad, to wit,
$38,876, $33,648.54, and $24,372.25, were made to show the
relative rights of the bondholders of the different portions of
the entire road, and that in fact no interest was ever paid upon
such bonds, except the sum of $2,360.67, and that said accounts
still remain open and unsettled upon the books, and that there
never were any net earnings of said company to pay interest on
said bonds, and that no such interest was ever paid; but at
the time of the change of management, July 1, 1869, he understood that the said bonds were arranged or settled, but in
what way he was unadvised.

The defendant then asked that it should be credited in this
suit as against the claims proven by the plaintiff the said
amount of $3,866.66 as mentioned .in said voucher, but the
court being of opinion that no interest was, in fact, ever paid
on said bonds of the Northern Illinois Railroad Company, no
tax was ever due or payable thereon, but inasmuch as said
93,866.66 had been paid on account of such tax, the defendant
was not entitled to have credit allowed therefor in this suit.
To which ruling the defendant excepted.
The defendant further requested the court to rule and decide that the plaintiff was not entitled to a tax of two and a
half per cent upon the said $61,676.61 received by the company for transportation of the mails from July 1, 1866, to
Jan. 1, 1870, but the court refused to do so, and decided that,
although there was no evidence of a contract bearing date prior
to Aug. 1, 1866, and no proof of an express contract, yet as
the mails were carried and compensation received therefor the
law would imply a contract, and therefore that the plaintiff
was entitled to said tax on that amount; to which ruling and
decision the defendant excepted.
The defendant further requested the court to decide that the
plaintiff was not entitled to a tax of five per cent upon the
amount of $61,495.00, the amount of interest paid on the bonds
of the company on or after the first day of August, 1870, but
that a tax of only two and a half per cent was due thereon;
but the court refused so to decide, but on the contrary decided
that the plaintiff was entitled to a tax thereon of five per cent;
to which ruling and decision the defendant also excepted.
The defendant further requested the court to decide that the
plaintiff was not entitled to a tax of two and a half per cent on
five-sixths of $52,423.71, the amount of interest paid on the
bonds of the company on and after Feb. 1, 1872; but the
court then and there refused so to decide, but decided that
the plaintiff was entitled to said tax of two and a half per cent;
to which ruling and decision the defendant excepted.
The case having been tried without the intervention of a
jury, the court below rendered judgment in favor of the United
States for $5,933.70. The company thereupon sued out this
writ, and assigns for error that the court erred, -

RAILROAD CO. V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

-1. In refusing to allow the sum of $3,866.66, paid Nov. 7,
1865, by the Northern Illinois Railroad Company, to be credited to the account of the defendant.
2. In deciding that a tax of two and a half per cent was
due the plaintiff on the sum of $61,676.61, received by the defendant for transportation of the mails from July 1, 1866, to
Jan. 1, 1870.
3. In ruling that a tax of five per cent was due plaintiff
upon the amount of $61,495 of interest paid on the bonds of
the company on or after Aug. 1, 1870.
4. In admitting evidence to show that the sum of $52,423.71
became due and payable for interest on the bonds of the defendant, Feb. 1, 1872, and that the same was paid.
5. In deciding that a tax of two and a half per cent was
due the plaintiff on five-sixths of the amount of interest paid
on its bonded debt Feb. 1, 1872.
Mr. John W. Cary for the plaintiff in error.
The Solicitor- General, contra.
MIB. CH=F JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
The different assignments of error in this case will be considered in their order.
1. As to the claim for a credit of $3,866.66 on account of
taxes erroneously assessed and collected, Nov. 7, 1865.
Sect. 951 of the Revised Statutes provides that "in suits
brought by the United States against individuals, no claim for
a credit shall be admitted upon trial, except such as appear to
have been presented to the accounting officers of the treasury,
for their examination, and to have been by them disallowed in
whole or in part," save under certain circumstances not material to this case. Sect. 3220 of the Revised Statutes authorizes
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, "on appeal to him
made, to remit, refund, and pay back all taxes . . . that
appear to be unjustly assessed, or excessive in amount, or in
any manner wrongfully collected."
It does not appear that this claim was ever presented to the
accounting officers of the treasury for allowance, on appeal or
otherwise, or that it has ever been disallowed. For this rea-

son, notwithstanding its apparent equity, the credit was properly refused in this suit. H1alliburtonv. United States, 13 Wall.
63 ; United States v. Giles, 9 Cranch, 212.
2. As to the tax of two and a half per cent on the amount
received for the transportation of mails between July 1, 1866,
and Jan. 1, 1870.
By the act of July 13, 1866 (14 Stat. 135, sect. 103 of the
act of 1864 as amended), "every . . .corporation owning
. . . any railroad . .. engaged or employed in . . .transporting the mails of the United States upon contracts made
prior to Aug. 1, 1866, shall be subject to and pay a tax of two
and one half per cent of the gross receipts" from such
service.
No express contract for carrying the mails was proven, but
since the service for which the compensation was paid began
before August 1, and was continued without interruption for
the whole term in question, the court below implied a contract
prior to that time. This, we think, was right. Had payment
been refused and suit brought against the United States in the
Court of Claims, to recover for the service rendered, there could
be no doubt about the right to recover, notwithstanding the jurisdiction of that court is confined to suits on contracts (Salomon
v. United States, 19 Wall. 17) ; and this not alone because the
service had been rendered, but because it is to be presumed
that when the company commenced the transportation it had
been agreed that payment should be made for what was done.
3. As to whether taxes are payable on interest falling due
Aug. 1, 1870, at the rate of five per cent or two and a half per
cent.
The ruling of the court below on this point was in accordance with our decisions in Stockdale v. Insurance Companies,
(20 Wall. 323), and Railroad Company v. Rose, 95 U. S.78.
4. As to the tax on interest due and payable Feb. 1, 1872.
The act of 1870 (16 Stat. 260, sect. 15) provided "that
there shall be levied and collected for and during the year
1871 a tax of two and one half per centum on the amount of all
interest or coupons paid on bonds or other evidences of debt
issued and payable in one or more years after date, by any"
railroad company, "and on the amount of all dividends of

RAILROAD CO. V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

earnings, income, or gains hereafter declared," "whenever and
wherever the same shall be payable, . . . and on all undivided
profits . . . which have accrued and been earned and added to
any surplus, contingent, or other fund."
The interest in this case was neither payable nor paid in 1871,
and as the tax is not leviable or collectible until the interest is
payable, we see no way in which the company can be charged
on this account. The tax is not on the interest as it accrues,
but when it is paid. No provision is made for a pro rata distribution of the burden over the time the interest is accumulating, and as the tax can only be levied for and during the
year 1871, we think, if the interest is in good faith not payable
in that year, the tax is not demandable, either in whole or in
part.
There is no question here of earnings, for the finding is not
as to what was earned by the company during the year 1871,
but as to what was paid in 1872 on account of interest then for
the first time falling due. We are aware that at the present
term we held, in Railroad Company v. Collector (100 U. S. 595),
tloat the tax levied under the act now in question was essentially a tax on the business of the corporation, and that in order
to secure its payment it was laid on the subjects to which the
earnings were to be applied in the usual course of business;
but as this tax could not be levied until 1872, and there is no
finding of any earnings in 1871, we see nothing to be taxed
under that rule. In Barnes v. Railroad Companies (17 Wall.
809) it appeared expressly that the dividends were declared
out of the earnings of 1869.
It follows that to the extent of $1,092.16, and the interest
thereon, the judgment below was wrong, but in all other
respects right. Consequently the judgment below will be
reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to enter a
judgment against the railroad company for . . . $5,933.70
