WALDEN V. SKINNER.
1. Where, as in this case, the evidence exhibited in the record shows that the
purchase of land was made upon certain trusts which through mistake the
trustee failed to have properly declared in the deed, the cestui que trust is
entitled to a decree directing the deed to be reformed.
2. The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is not defeated by the fact that with the
principal defendant are joined, as nominal parties, the executors of a deceased trustee, citizens of the same State as the complainant, to perform
the ministerial act of conveying title, in case the power to do so is vested in
them by the laws of the State.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of Georgia.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Hr. Benjamin H. Hill for the appellant.
_4r. A. B. Lawton, contra.
MR. JUSTICE CLirFF ORD delivered the opinion of the court.

Trusts are either express or implied, the former being such as
are raised or created by the act of the parties, and the latter
being such as are raised or created by presumption or construction of law. Coo/c v. Fountain, 3 Swanst. 585, 592.
Implied trusts may also be divided into two general classes:
First, those that rest upon the presumed intention of the parti~s. Secondly, those which are independent of any such express
intentions, and are forced upon the conscience of the party by
operation of law. 2 Story, Eq. Jur., sect. 1195.
Sufficient appears to show that Sarah S. Walden, the complainant, on the sixth day of May, 1874, filed her bill of complaint
in the court below against the respondents, to wit, Darius S.
Skinner and John N. Lewis and Charles S. Hardee, executors of
Charles S. Henry, deceased, who in his lifetime was the trustee
of Penelope '". Tefft and her three children. Preliminary to
the charging part of her complaint she alleges and states that on
the 28th of October, 1847, she intermarried with William P.
Tefft, who on the 9th of August, five years later, departed this
life intestate and without children, leaving the complainant as his
sole heir and legal representative; that on the 4th of June, six
years subsequent to the death of her first husband, she intervoL. xi.

37

WALDEN4 V. SKINNER.

[Sup. Ct.

married with Clarles C. Walden, who, on the eighth day of
December of the next year, departed this life testate, leaving
no children by the complainant, and that he by his will bequeathed to her all the property and rights owned and possessed by her at the date of their marriage; and that the
father of her first husband died intestate on the 80th of June,
1862, but that no administration was ever had upon his estate,
and that his widow, the mother of her first husband, departed
this life testate on the 11th of September eleven years later;
that her first husband had two brothers at the date of her marriage neither of whom ever married and both of whom died without children, that at the death of the elder of the two he had a
life policy of insurance for $5,000, which his administrator
collected and paid to his two living brothers.
Allegations then follow in the bill of complaint which relate
more immediately to the subject-matter of the controversy,
from which it appears that Elias Fort, June 28, 1831, conveyed
a certain tract of land to Charles S. Henry and Stephen C.
Greene, as trustees and in trust for Penelope W. Tefft and her
three sons, William P. Tefft, Henry D. Tefft, and Charles E.
Tefft, and it is therein declared that the said property is for the
use of the mother during her lifetime and the three sons, and
that after the death of the mother it shall be for the use of the
three sons alone as tenants in common, and that in case of sale
",the proceeds to be reinvested upon the same uses and trusts
as aforesaid, and if not sold, then the property, after the death
of the mother, was to be distributed by said trustees to each of
the said sons as shall survive and attain the age of twenty-one
years."
Greene, one of the trustees, subsequently died, leaving
Charles S. Henry the sole surviving trustee under the trust-deed,
and she charges that on the 19th of July, 1848, the mayor and
aldermen of the city of Savannah conveyed to him as such
trustee a certain lot of land numbered five, Monterey Ward,
in said city, the lot being then subject to certain annual groundrents, as specified in the conveyance, and the complainant avers
that the conveyance is informal and incomplete, inasmuch as
the trustee never signed it, as it was intended, and that it fails
to set forth and express the trust interests of the three children

Oct. 1879.]

WALDEN V. SKINNER.

as it should do. Wherefore she alleges that it should be
reformed and be made to conform to the purposes of the trust
as created and set forth in the original trust-deed.
Persuasive and convincing reasons in support of that request
are alleged which will hereafter be reproduced when the merits of the controversy are considered.
Relief specific and general is prayed, as is more fully set forth
in the transcript. Process was served and the respondents
appeared, and after certain interlocutory proceedings filed separate answers.
All of the defences to the merits are set up in the answer of
the first named respondent, who admits all of the preliminary
matters alleged in the bill of complaint. He also admits that
there was in existence at the time of the first marriage of the
complainant the trust estate held by the surviving trustee arising under the conveyance from Elias Fort to the said two trustees, which, as he alleges, was held for the sole and separate use
of the mother during her life, and remainder at her death to
her three sons as tenants in common.
Prior to that transaction there is no controversy between the
parties as to the facts, and he also admits that the authorities
of the city conveyed the lot called Monterey Ward to the surviving trustee, but he alleges that by the terms of the conveyance the legal title to the lot vested in the trustee in trust for
the sole and separate use of the mother, the trust being executory only so long and for such time as the cestui que trust
should remain a feme covert; and he denies that the conveyance is informal and incomplete in any particular, or that it
was ever expected or intended by any one that the trustee
should sign the same, and he avers that it was accepted by
the trustee for the purposes therein set forth.
Attempt is also made to enforce that view by a specific denial
of most of the reasons assigned in the bill of complaint in support of the request that the conveyance to the trustee of the
lot called Monterey Ward may be reformed so as to conform
to the trusts created and expressed in the antecedent trustdeed.
Both of the other respondents allege that they are citizens of
the State where the suit is brought, and deny that the Circuit

580

WALDEN V. SKINNER.

[Sup. Cb.

Court had any jurisdiction to make or execute any order, judgment, or decree against them in the premises.
Proofs were taken, the parties heard, and the Circuit Court
,entered a decree in favor of the respondents, dismissing the
bill of complaint. Prompt appeal was taken by the complainant to this court, and since the appeal was brought up she has
filed the assignment of errors set forth in the brief of her counsel. They are ten in number, all of which will be sufficiently
considered in the course of the opinion, without giving each a
separate examination.
Before examining the questions presented in respect to the
second deed, it becomes necessary to ascertain the true construction and meaning of the original trust-deed so far as respects
the second trust therein created and defined. Eight hundred
dollars constituted the consideration of the conveyance, and it
was made upon the trust that if, during the lifetime of the
mother of the three sons, it should be deemed advisable by her
to sell and convey the premises, then upon this further trust
that the trustees as aforesaid, or the survivor of them, upon
her application and with her consent, signified by her being
a party to the conveyance, will sell and convey the lot and
improvements for the best price which can be obtained for the
same, to any person or persons whatsoever, without applying
to a court of law or equity for that purpose to authorize the
same, and the proceeds thereof upon the same trusts as aforesaid to invest in such other property or manner as the mother
of the sons shall direct and request for the same use, benefit,
and behalf.
Explicit and unambiguous as that provision is, it requires no
discussion to ascertain its meaning; nor is it necessary to enter
into any examination of the third trust specified in the conveyance, as it is conceded that the trust property was sold by the
surviving trustee for reinvestment during the lifetime of the
mother at her request, she joining in the conveyance as required
by the terms of the instrument creating the trust.
Twenty-four hundred dollars were received for the conveyance of the trust property, and all of that sum, except $600
turned over to the mother, was invested in buildings then being
erected upon lot numbered five, called the Monterey Ward.

Oet. 1879.]

WALDEN v.

SKINNER.

Purchase of that lot had previously been made by the surviving trustee named in the original trust-deed, and it appears that
the parties understood that it was to be upon the same uses and
trusts as were contained in the trust-deed by which the title to
the lot sold was acquired.
Proof that the new lot numbered five, called Monterey Ward,
was purchased by the father and the three sons during the lifetime of the father seems to be entirely satisfactory, and it is
equally well established that each contributed one-fourth part
of the sum of $240 paid for the purchase-money of the lot.
Satisfactory proof is also exhibited that Henry D. Tefft, one of
the three brothers, died Aug. 13, 1849, unmarried and intestate,
and that he had a valid subsisting insurance upon his life in
the sum of $5,000, which his administrator collected and paid
to his surviving brothers.
Eighteen hundred dollars of the proceeds arising from the
sale of the property acquired by virtue of the first trust-deed
were appropriated towards erecting buildings on the new lot
purchased by the father and the three sons while in full life, and
when the one whose life was insured deceased, the two survivors appropriated each his proportion of the money received to
the same purpose, with the understanding that the property
was subject to the same uses and trusts as the property previously acquired and sold.
Competent proofs of a convincing character are also exhibited in the transcript that the first husband of the complainant
contributed other sums towards completing the buildings, leaving no doubt that he paid his full proportion for the improvements as well as for the lot purchased of the city authorities.
Enough appears to show that the buildings were completed
more than two years before the first husband of the complainant died intestate and without children, when it is obvious that
she became the sole heir to all the interest he possessed in the
said estate, whatever it might be. Two years elapsed after the
buildings were completed before the father of the three sons
died, and the proofs show that during that period the complainant resided with the parents of her husband, and that her rights
as his heir-at-law were uniformly recognized by the family;
that she continued to reside there with her mother-in-law after

582

WALDEN V. SKINNER.

[Sup. Ct.

the death of the senior Tefft, until the decease of his widow,
and that throughout that period she paid one-half of all repairs, taxes, insurance, and other expenses of the property as
it she were equally interested in the same with her motherin-law, and was liable to bear an equal proportion of all such
expenses.
Opposed to that is the proof that the mother-in-law, one year
before her death, when in a low and depressed frame of mind,
bequeathed the whole of the lot in question to the first-named
respondent, who is her nephew, and on the same day executed
a deed to him of the entire property, to take effect in possession
after her death. Sole title to the premises in fee-simple is
claimed by the respondent under those instruments, and he
,brought ejectment against the complainant to dispossess her of
the premises, and it appears that she was at great disadvantage
in attempting to defend the suit, because the trustee had omitted to see that the title was conveyed in trust for the benefit of
the cestuis que trust as in the prior trust deed, as he should have
done, to carry into effect the understanding of all the parties to
the sale of the prior trust premises and the purchase of the lot
in question. What she alleges is that the purchase of the new
lot was made for the same cestuis que trust as those described
in the deed of the old lot, and that the understanding of all
was that the deed of the new lot should contain and declare
.the same uses and trusts in favor of the same persons, and the
proofs to that effect are full and entirely satisfactory.
Support to that view is also derived from the fact that the
surviving trustee in the old deed is the grantee in the new deed,
and that he is therein more than once described as trustee, and
in the introductory part of the instrument is denominated trustee of Mrs. Penelope W. Tefft, wife of Israel K. Tefft, of the
city and State previously mentioned in the same instrument.
Ten years before the suit was instituted the trustee in the
new deed departed this life, and the other two respondents were
appointed and qualified as his executors. Unable to obtain
complete redress at law, the complainant prays that the deed
of conveyance from the city of the lot and improvements in
question may be reformed and be made to conform to the true
intent and purpose for which the lot was purchased, and to

Oct. 1879.]

WALDEN V. SKINNER.

that end that it may be made to include the same uses and
trusts raised, created, and declared in the prior deed from Elias
Fort, according to the understanding and agreement of all the
parties.
Besides that she also prays that her equities in and to the
property, including the improvements, may be set forth, decreed,
and allowed by the court, including such as are in her favor
from the payment of taxes, insurance, and repairs upon the
property during the lifetime and since the death of her motherin-law, and that the first-named respondent may be enjoined
from further proceeding in his ejectment suit to recover possession of the premises.
Courts of equity afford relief in case of mistake of facts, and
allow parol evidence to vary and reform written contracts and
instruments, when the defect or error arises from accident or
misconception, as properly forming an exception to the general
rule which excludes parol testimony offered to vary or contradict written instruments. Where the mistake is admitted by
the other party, relief, as all agree, will be granted, and if it be
fully proved by other evidence, Judge Story says, the reasons
for granting relief seem to be equally satisfactory. 1 Story,
Eq. Jur., sect. 156.
Decisions of undoubted authority hold that where an instrument is drawn and executed that professes or is intended to
carry into execution an agreement, which is in writing or by
parol, previously made between the parties, but which by mistake of the draftsman, either as to fact or law, does not fulfil
or which violates the manifest intention of the parties to the
agreement, equity will correct the mistake so as to produce a
conformity of the instrument to the agreement, the reason of
the rule being that the execution of agreements fairly and
legally made is one of the peculiar branches of equity jurisdiction, and if the instrument intended to execute the agreement
be from any cause insufficient for that purpose, the agreement
remains as much unexecuted as if the party had refused altogether to comply with his engagement, and a court of equity
will, in the exercise of its acknowledged jurisdiction, afford
relief in the one case as well as in the other, by compelling the
delinquent party to perform his undertaking according to the

WALDEN V. SKINNER.

[Sup. Ct.

terms of it and the manifest intention of the parties. Hunt v.
Bousmaniere's Adm'rs, 1 Pet. 1, 13; Same v. Same, 8 Wheat.
174, 211.
Even a judgment when confessed, if the agreement was made
under a clear mistake, will be set aside if application be made,
and the mistake shown while the judgment is within the power
of the court. Such an agreement, even when made a rule of
court, will not be enforced if made under a mistake, if seasonable application be made to set it aside, and if the judgment be
no longer in the power of the court, relief, says Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, may be obtained in a court of chancery. The
Hiram, 1 Wheat. 440, 444.
Equitable rules of the kind are applicable to sealed instruments, as well as to ordinary written agreements, the rule being
that if by mistake a deed be drawn plainly different from the
agreement of the parties, a court of equity will grant relief by
considering the deed as if it had conformed to the antecedent
agreement. So if a deed be ambiguously expressed in such a
manner that it is difficult to give it a construction, the agreement may be referred to as an aid in expounding such an ambiguity; but if the deed is so expressed that a reasonable
construction may be given to it, and when so given it does not
plainly appear to be at variance with the agreement, then the
latter i's not to be regarded in the construction of the former.
Hogan v. Insurance Co., 1 Wash. 419, 422.
Rules of decision in suits for specific performance are necessarily affected by considerations peculiar to the nature of the
right sought to be enforced and the remedy employed to
accomplish the object. Where no question of fraud or mistake
is involved, the rule with respect to the admission of parol evidence to vary a written contract is the same in courts of equity
as in those of common law, the rule in both being that when
an agreement is reduced to writing by the act and consent of
the parties, the intent and meaning of the same must be sought
in the instrument which they have chosen as the repository
and evidence of their purpose, and not in extrinsic facts and
allegations. Proof of fraud or mistake, however, may be admitted in equity to show that the terms of the instrument
employed in the preparation of the same were varied or made

Ot. 1879.]

WALDEN V. SKINNER.

different by addition or subtraction from what they were
intended and believed to be when the same was executed.
Evidence of fraud or mistake is seldom found in the instrument itself, from which it follows that unless parol evidence
may be admitted for that purpose the aggrieved party would
have as little hope of redress in a court of equity as in a court
of law. Even at law, all that pertains to the execution of a
written instrument or to the proof that the instrument was
adopted or ratified by the parties as their act or contract, is
necessarily left to extrinsic evidence, and witnesses may consequently be called for the purpose of impeaching the execution
of a deed or other writing under seal, and showing that its sealing or delivery was procured by fraudulently substituting one
instrument for another, or by any other species of fraud by
which the complaining .party was misled and induced to put
his name to that which was substantially different from the
actual agreement. Thoroughgood's Case, 4 Coke, 4.
When the deed or other written instrument is duly executed
and delivered, the courts of law hold ihat it contains the true
agreement of the parties, and that the writing furnishes better
evidence of the sense of the parties than any that can be
supplied by parol; but courts of equity, says Chancellor Kent,
have a broader jurisdiction and will open the written contract
to let in an equity arising from facts perfectly distinct from the
sense and construction of the instrument itself. Pursuant to
that rule, he held it to be established that relief can be had
against any deed or contract in writing founded on mistake or
fraud, and that mistake may be shown by parol proof and the
relief granted to the injured party whether he sets up the mistake affirmatively by bill or as a defence. Gillespie v. Moon,
2 Johns. (N. Y.) Ch. 585, 596.
Parol proof, said the same learned magistrate, is admissible
in equity to correct a mistake in a written contract in favor of
the complainant seeking a specific performance, especially
where the contract in the first instance is imperfect without
referring to extrinsic facts. .feisselbracl v. Livingston, 4 id.
144; Cathcart v. -obinson, 5 Pet. 264.
Many cases support that proposition without qualification,
and all or nearly all agree that it is correct where it is invoked

WALDEN

V. SKINNER.

[Slip Ot.

as defence to a suit to enforce specific performance. Little or
no disagreement is found in the adjudged cases to that extent,
but there are many others where it is held that the rule is
unsound when applied in behalf of a complainant seeking to
enforce a specific performance of a contract with variations
from the written instrument. Diffculty, it must be admitted,
would arise in any attempt to reconcile the decided cases in
that regard, but it is not necessary to enter that field of contest
and conflict in the case before the court for several reasons:
1. Because by comparing the original trust deed with the deed
of the lot in question, in view of the attendant circumstances,
the inference is very cogent that the second was designed and
intended as a complete substitute for the first. 2. Because
the proof shows to a demonstration that the consideration for
the purchase of the second lot was paid in equal proportions
by the father and each of the three sons. 3. Because it appears
that the expensive improvements made upon the lot in question
were made from the moneys of each of the three sons, advanced
at the request of the father. 4. Because it appears that the
family and every member of it understood from the first and
throughout that the trustee held the property in trust for the
mother and the three sons. 5. Because the father, from the
date of the deed to the time of his death, recognized the premises as acquired and held for the benefit of his wife and their
three sons. 6. Because the mother of the three sons, after the
decease of the first husband of complainant, recognized her as
interested in the property, and continued to do so at all times
throughout her life until about the time she conveyed the lot
in question to the respondent.
Both the deed and her will bear date Sept. 28, 1872, and the
proofs show that she was at the time in a low, depressed state
of mind, and that she departed this life within one year subsequent to the execution of those instruments. Prior to that,
and throughout the whole period subsequent to the death of
her husband, the proofs show that she uniformly recognized
the complainant as the owner of a moiety of the lot and the
improvements, and always required her to pay one-half of all
repairs, taxes, insurance, and other expenses of the property.
By the terms of the original deed the property was conveyed
k

Oct. 1879.]

WALDEN V. SKINNER.

to the trustees, subject to the payment of taxes, assessments,
and ground-rent, to and for the sole and separate use, benefit,
and behoof of the mother and her three sons during her lifetime, and after her death to the three sons as tenants in common in equal parts, with the provision that if the mother during
her lifetime should deem it advisable she might sell and convey
the premises, and that in that event the further trust was raised
and created that the trustees or the survivor of them, upon her
application and with her consent signified by becoming a party
to the conveyance, might sell and convey the lot and improvements for the best price which could be obtained for the same,
without any application to a court of law or equity for that
purpose, and to invest the proceeds thereof upon the same
trusts in such other property or manner as the mother should
direct, and for the same use, benefit, and behalf.
Provision was also made that if no such sale and re-investment was made during the lifetime of the mother, then the
trustees were to sell the same for the sole use and benefit of
the three sons or the survivor or survivors of them, share and
share alike, until the youngest should arrive at the age of
twenty-one years, when the trustees might sell and convey the
same at the request of such survivor or survivors, and divide
the proceeds to the survivor or survivors, share and share
alike.
Taken as a whole the proofs show to the entire satisfaction
of the court that the lot in question was purchased and conveyed to the surviving trustee upon the same trusts as those
raised and created in the first deed, and that the trustee, through
mistake, failed to have those trusts properly declared in the
deed of trust to him as he should have done, and that the
prayer of the bill of complainant, that the deed of the lot and
improvements in question ought to be reformed and the rights
of the complainant be ascertained and adjudged as if the deed
in question contained the same trusts as those raised and
created in the original trust deed is reasonable and proper and
should be granted.
Courts of equity, beyond all doubt, possegs the power to
grant such relief, and the proofs, in the judgment of the court,
are such as to entitled the complainant to such a decree, unless

WALDEN V. SKINNER.

[Sup. Ct.

the remaining defence set up by the respondent must prevail.
Cooper v. Phibs, Law Rep. 2 Ch. Ap. 149, 186; Cochrane
v. Willis, 34 Beav. 359, 366. Such a decree, of course, cannot
now be made against the trustee, as he is not living; but the
executors, as contended by the complainant, are competent to
perform that duty, and she prays that the decree may be adapted to the present state of the parties.
Suppose all that is true, still it is contended by the principal
respondent that the decree below is correct, because the claim
is barred. Mluch discussion of that defence will not be fhecessary, beyond what is required to ascertain the facts.
When the father died,-the complainant was living on the
premises, and she continued to reside there most or all the time
during the widowhood of the mother of her first husband, except
while she lived with her second husband, and when he died she
returned to live with her mother-in-law. During all that time
the proofs show that she was constantly recognized as the lawful heir to the estate of her deceased husband, until about a
year before the decease of the mother, who also resided on the
premises. Prior to that, the rights of the complainant were
unmistakably recognized, and nothing of consequence had occurred to indicate any intent to call her just right in question.
Soon after that, however, the respondent commenced an action
of ejectment against her to recover possession of the entire lot
and improvements, she still being in possession, and doubtless
hoping and expecting that her rights would yet be acknowledged without the necessity of expensive litigation. Expectations of the kind not being realized, she filed the present bill of
complaint. Laches are imputed to her; but the court, in view
of the circumstances and of the embarrassments growing out of
the obvious defects in the conveyance intended to secure her
rights, is of the opinion that the evidence of laches is not sufficient to bar her right to recover in the present suit. Without more, these remarks are sufficient to show that the defence
cannot be sustained, and it is accordingly overruled.
Two or three remarks will be sufficient to show that the objection that the 'Circuit Court has no jurisdiction to enter the
required decree against the executors of the deceased trustee
cannot be sustained. Jurisdiction as between the complainant

Oct. 1[879.]

WALDEN V. SKINNER.

and respondent is unquestionable; and, if so, it is clear that the
fact that the trustee if living was a citizen of the same State
with the complainant would not defeat the jurisdiction in a case
where be is a mere nominal party, and is merely joined to perform the ministerial act of conveying the title if adjudged to
the complainant. Where that is so, the executor, in case of the
decease of the trustee, if authorized by the law of the State to
execute such a conveyance, may also be joined in the suit under
like circumstances merely to accomplish the like purpose.
Where the real and only controversy is between citizens of
different States, or an alien and a citizen, and the plaintiff is by
some positive rule of law compelled to use the name of another
to perform merely a ministerial act, who has not nor ever bad
any interest in or control over it, the courts of the United
States will not consider any others as parties to the suit than
the persons between whom the litigation before them exists.
X.Lirtt v. Bland, 2 How. 9, 15 ; Browna v. Strode, 5 Cranch,
303; Coal Company v. Blatchford, 11 Wall. 172, 177,
Cases arise in the Federal courts in which nominal or even
immaterial parties are joined, on the one side or the other, with
those who have the requisite citizenship to give the court jurisdiction in the case; and where that is so, the rule is settled
that the mere fact that one or more of such parties reside in
the same State with one of the actual parties to the controversy will not defeat the jurisdiction of the court. Decisive
authority for that proposition is found in a recent ruling of Mr.
Justice Miller, in which he states to the effect that mere formal parties do not oust the jurisdiction of the court, even if
they are without the requisite citizenship, where it appears that
the real controversy is between citizens of different States.
Arapahoe County v. Kansas Padfic Railway Co., 4 Dill. 277,
283.
Nothing is claimed of the executors in this case except that
they shall perform the ministerial act of conveying the title, in
case the power to do so is vested in them by the law of the
State, and the court shall enter a decree against the principal
respondent to that effect. From all which it follows that the
complainant is entitled as between herself and the principal
respondent to the relief prayed in the bill of complaint; but
