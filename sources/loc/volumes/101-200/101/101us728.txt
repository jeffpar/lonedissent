MEYER V. HORNBY.

[Sup. Ot.

The certificate of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is a
condition precedent to a credit by the First Comptroller of the
Treasury before suit, but not to a defence upon the facts if a
suit is brought.
The presentation to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
by a collector of a claim for credit in his account, and its rejection by him, is such a presentation of the claim "to the
accounting officers of the treasury for their examination," and
disallowance by them, as will permit the collector, under sect.
951, Rev. Stat., to make proof of his claim in a suit brought
against him by the United States to collect what is due from
him on his account.
J"udgment affirmed.

MEYER v. HOR.NBY.
1. The ruling in Brooks v. Railway Company (supra,p. 443), that work done by a

contractor upon a part of a railroad then in process of construction entitles
his lien, under the laws of Iowa, to precedence over that of a prior mortgage
upon the entire road, reaffirmed.

2. The contractor was a stockholder in a construction company, which, when it
placed on the market the bonds secured by the mortgage, gave a guaranty
that the local subscriptions and grants would be sufficient to prepare the
road for the reception of the rails, and also undertook to make good any
deficiency. Held, that he was not thereby estopped from setting up his
lien, as against the mortgagee.
3. If the holders of the bonds sustained any loss by reason of the guaranty, the
company which gave it is liable in damages.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Iowa.
The facts are sufficiently stated in the opinion of the court.

to a mechanic's lien, which was allowed. The mortgagor and
owner of the road was the Davenport and St. Paul Railroad
Company, incorporated to build a road from Davenport, in Iowa,
to St. Paul, in Minnesota. The mortgage, executed May 16,
1872, embraced the entire line of road, and all present and afteracquired property therewith connected. The route was surveyed from Davenport to St. Paul, and work some three miles
out from the city of Davenport was commenced and prosecuted
il the direction of St. Paul, until about forty-eight miles were
completed. When this work was begun, the part of the road
surveyed in Scott County, from Davenport to Pine Hill Cemetery, included a difficult and expensive ascent from the riverbottom, on which the town is mainly situated, to the prairie land
above the bluff. Its construction was for this reason delayed,
and a temporary running arrangement made with another company, by which the cars from the country came into the city.
The work on that piece of road was, however, commenced on a
contract with Hornby, of date of Oct. 9, 1872, and finished prior
to the first day of November, 1873. On the 28th of that month
he filed his claim for a mechanic's lien in the proper court. The
mortgage was recorded in that county, Dec. 24,1872, but Hornby
knew of its existence when he made the contract under which he
claims his lien.
Two objections are taken to this lien. One of them is that
Hornby himself was a stockholder in the Davenport Railway
Construction Company, a corporation which placed the bonds
secured by appellants' mortgage on the market, and which gave
a guaranty that the local subscriptions and grants should be
sufficient to prepare the road for the reception of the rails, and
undertook to make good any deficiency in such local aid. Six
gentlemen also signed an agreement to be personally bound to
make good the guaranty of the construction company. Hornby
was not one of them, and it is not charged that he ever made
any personal representations on the subject to purchasers of the
bonds or to any one else.
But it is argued that because he was a stockholder of the
construction company he is now estopped to set up his lien for
work and labor performed, to the detriment of these bondholders. It is difficult to see how any such claim can be sustained.

MEYER v. HORNBY.

[Sup. Ct.

It was the corporation, and not he, who gave the guaranty. If
the bondholders have suffered any loss for which that instrument provides a remedy, the corporation is liable to suit for
damages. Even then it must be proved that there has' been a
loss, and that the loss was shffered because the local subscriptions and grants were not sufficient to prepare the whole of
said line for the rails. Before he can in any event be held
liable, it must be shown that the construction company is liable
and cannot respond to that liability.
Nothing of this kind is shown by the record. It might be
otherwise if it were proved that he used this guaranty fraudulently and with false statements to negotiate the bonds; but
this is not alleged or proven. We see no place for an estoppel
in the case.
The other error alleged concerns the fact that the part of
the road on which Hornby did his work, namely, the three
miles between Pine Hill Cemetery and the city, is a separate
division and not a part of the principal road, and that no
lien as against these mortgagees can be established for that
reason.
We have considered this question so fully in the case of
Brooks v. Railway Company (suTpra, p. 443), that it is unnecessary to discuss it here. It is sufficient to say that, under
the principle there laid down, that three miles is a part of the
improvement, and the lien attaches to the whole of it. The
fact that they consented that the court should limit it to
the three miles can do appellants no harm.
