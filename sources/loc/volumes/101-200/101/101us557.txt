SHAW

v. RAm-ROAD ComPANY.

1. Statutes are not to be construed as altering the common law, or as making
any innovation therein, further than their words import.
2. Although a statute makes bills of lading negotiable by indorsement and delivery, it does not follow that all the consequences incident to the indorsement of bills and notes before maturity ensue or are intended to result from
such negotiation.
3. The rule that a bona fide purchaser of a lost or stolen bill or note indorsed in
blank or payable to bearer is not bound to look beyond the instrument, has
no application to the case of a lost or stolen bill of lading.
4. The purchaser of a bill of lading who has reason to believe that his vendor
was not the owner thereof, or that it was held to secure an outstanding
draft, is not a bona fide purchaser, nor entitled to hold the merchandise covered by the bill against its true owner.
5. Where the judgment below was entered properly, this court will not remand
the case for a new trial because of the verbal mistake of the clerk in using
a superfluous word in entering the verdict. As the verdict was amendable
in the court below, the amendment will be regarded as made.
ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
This is an action of replevin brought by the Merchants' National Bank of St. Louis, Missouri, against Shaw & Esrey, of
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to recover possession of certain
cotton, marked "W D I." One hundred and forty-one bales
thereof having been taken possession of by the marshal were
returned to the defendants upon their entering into the proper
bond. On Nov. 11, 1874, Norvell & Co., of St. Louis, sold to
the bank their draft for $11,947.43 on M. Kuhn & Brother, of

SHAW V. IRALROAD

CO.

[Sup. Ct.

Philadelphia, and, as collateral security for the payment thereof
indorsed in blank and delivered to the bank an original bill of
lading for one hundred and seventy bales of cotton that day
shipped to the last-named city. The duplicate bill of lading
was on the same day forwarded to Kuhn & Brother by Norvell
& Co. The Merchants' Bank forwarded the draft, with the bill
of lading thereto attached, to the Bank of North America. On
November 14, the last-named bank sent the draft - the original
bill of lading still being attached thereto - to Kuhn & Brother
by its messenger for acceptance. The messenger presented the
draft and bill to one of the members of that firm, who accepted
the former, but, without being detected, substituted the duplicate for the original bill of lading.
On the day upon which this transaction occurred, Kuhn &
Brother indorsed the original bill of lading to Miller & Brother,
and received thereon an advance of $8,500. Within a few days
afterwards, the cotton, or rather that portion of it which is
in controversy, was, through the agency of a broker, sold by
sample with the approval of Kuhn & Brother to the defendants,
who were manufacturers at Chester, Pennsylvania. The bill
of lading, having been deposited on the same day with the
North Pennsylvania Railroad Company, at whose depot the
cotton was expected to arrive, it was on its arrival delivered to
the defendants.
The fact that the Bank of North America held the duplicate
instead of the original bill of lading was discovered for the first
time on the 9th of December, by the president of the plaintiff,
who had gone to Philadelphia in consequence of the failure of
Kuhn & Brother and the protest of the draft.
The defendants below contended that the bill of lading was
negotiable in the ordinary sense of that word; that Miller &
Brother had purchased it for value in the usual course of business, and that they thereby had acquired a valid title to the cotton, which was not impaired by proof that Kuhn & Brother had
fraudulently got possession of the bill; but the court left it to
the jury to determine, 1st, Whether there was any negligence of the plaintiff or its
agents in parting with possession of the bill of lading.
2d, Whether Miller & Brother knew any fact or facts from

Oct. 1879.]

which they had reason to believe that the bill of lading was
held to secure payment of an outstanding draft.
The jury having found the first question in the negative and
the second in the affirmative, further found "the value of the
goods eloigned" to be $7,015.97, assessed the plaintiff's damages at that sum with costs, for which amount the court entered
a judgment. Shaw & Esrey thereupon sued out this writ of
error.
The remaining facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. Janze8 E. Cowen for the plaintiffs in error.
The original bill of lading was a negotiable instrument. By
its indorsement, while the cotton was in transit to Miller &
Brother for a valuable consideration, and without notice of any
defect in the title of Kuhn & Brother, they acquired a valid title
to the goods.
When the Merchants' National Bank of St. Louis took the
bill of lading, Missouri was the place in which the contract was
made, - the place in which the property was actually situated,
- and it was the domicile of all the contracting parties. There
can be no doubt, therefore, that the legal effect of the bill was,
for the time being, at least determinable by the law of that
State. Scudder v. Union National Bank, 91 U. S.406; Peninsular and Oriental Steamshi Co. v. Shand, 3 Moo. P. 0. 0.

The bill of lading in the hands of Miller & Brother, even if
its effect were determinable by the law of Pennsylvania, would
be a negotiable instrument. The statute of that State expressly enacts that warehouse receipts or bills of lading shall
be negotiable. It is a familiar principle that technical words
in a statute are to be taken in a technical sense, unless it appears that they were intended to be applied differently from

560

[Sup. Ct.

their ordinary or legal acceptation. United States v. Jones,
8 Wash. 209; United States v. Wilson & Peters, Baldw. 78;
Me Cool v. Smith, 1 Black, 459.
"'Negotiable' and 'negotiability' signify that an instrument is capable of being transferred so as to be free from any
questions between original parties, the quality of being vendible by commercial indorsement." Abbott's Law Dictionary.
It is necessary to inquire, then, whether there is any thing in
the act which denotes an intent to use the word "negotiable"
in its ordinary legal sense. An examination shows that the
legislature had in view the ordinary meaning of the word.
The act provides that bills of lading and warehouse receipts
may be transferred by "indorse m ent and delivery," thus using
a term applicable solely to the transfer of negotiable instruments. The proviso to the first section enacts that all warehouse receipts or bills of lading having the words "not negotiable" plainly written or stamped on the face thereof shall be
exempt from the provisions of the act. The proviso would be
unmeaning, if the object of the act was not to make bills of
lading actually negotiable instead of merely assignable, since
it must be presumed that "negotiable" is used in the same
sense in the proviso as in the body of the section.
Moreover, it should not be assumed that the object in passing
the act was to impart to bills of lading the quality of assignability when by the common law they already had that quality
to the fullest extent.
In a number of the States, statutes were passed at an early
period for the purpose of making promissory notes negotiable
instruments. Many of them resembled the Missouri statute in
the present case, in superadding the words "like bills of exchange." Thus the statute of New York provided that "all
notes in writing . . . shall be negotiable in like manner as
inland bills of exchange." But in many of the States all such
words were omitted. Thus in Virginia the statute enacted
that "every promissory note or check for money payable in
this State at a particular bank . . . and every inland bill of
exchange payable in this State shall be deemed negotiable."
Code of Virginia (edition of 1860), p. 629. Yet certainly no
one would contend that the omission of the words "like bills

Oct. 1879.]

SHAW

v.

of exchange" in some of these statutes rendered promissory
notes negotiable in some other sense than bills of exchange
were negotiable.
The fact that Miller & Brother knew any fact or facts from
which they had reason to believe that the bill of lading was
held to secure payment of an outstanding draft does not invalidate their title, - mala fides on their part must be shown.
Goodman v. Simonds, 20 How. 843; Murray v. Lardner, 2
WIrall. 110. Phelan v. 31oss (67 Pa. St. 59) holds that a bona
fide holder for value of a negotiable note without notice can
recover upon it, notwithstanding he took it under circumstances which ought to have excited the suspicions of a prudent
man, and that, in order to destroy his title, his taking the note
mala fide must be shown.
The court erred in entering a judgment upon the verdict
which found, not the value of the goods which had been replevied, but the value of those which been eloigned. This was
a palpable error, but at the same time it is not pretended that
it was any thing but the consequence of an unnoticed mistake in
entering the verdict. The difficulty, however, is that the record, as it now stands, shows a judgment relating not to the
property in actual controversy, but to that with which the
defendants had nothing to do. They therefore have a right to
complain of the insufficiency of the record, in not showing
their discharge from responsibility for the cotton which really
formed the subject-matter of this suit.
31r. Robert

. Willson and Mlr. George Junkin, contra.

MR. JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.

The defendants below, now plaintiffs in error, bought the
cotton from Miller & Brother by sample, through a cotton
broker. No bill of lading or other written evidence of title in
their vendors was exhibited to them. Hence, they can have no
other or better title than their vendors had.
The inquiry, therefore, is, what title had Miller & Brother as
against the bank, which confessedly was the owner, and which
is still the owner, unless it has lost its ownership by the fraudulent act of Kuhn & Brother. The cotton was represented by
the bill of lading given to Norvell & Co., at St. Louis, and by
VOL. XI.

[Sup. Or.

them indorsed to the bank, to secure the payment of an accompanying discounted time-draft. That indorsement vested
in the bank the title to the cotton, as well as to the contract.
While it there continued, and during the transit of the cotton
from St. Louis to Philadelphia, the endorsed bill of lading was
stolen by one of the firm of Kuhn & Brother, and by them
indorsed over to Miller & Brother, for an advance of $8,500.
The jury has found, however, that there was no negligence of
the bank, or of its agents, in parting with possession of the bill
of lading, and that Miller & Brother knew facts from which
they had reason to believe it was held to secure the payment of
an outstanding draft; in other words, that Kuhn & Brother
were not the lawful owners of it, and had no right to dispose
of it.
It is therefore to be determined whether Miller & Brother,
by taking the bill of lading from Kuhn & Brother under these
circumstances, acquired thereby a good title to the cotton as
against the bank.
In considering this question, it does not appear to us necessary
to inquire whether the effect of the bill of lading in the hands
of Miller & Brother is to be determined by the law of Missouri,
where the bill was given, or by the law of Pennsylvania, where
the cotton was delivered. The statutes of both States enact
that bills of lading shall be negotiable by indorsement and delivery. The statute of Pennsylvania declares simply, they "shall
be negotiable and may be transferred by indorsement and delivery;" while that of Missouri enacts that "they shall be negotiable by written indorsement thereon and delivery, in the sane
manner as bills of exchange and promissory notes." There is
no material difference between these provisions. Both statutes
prescribe the manner of negotiation; i. e., by indorsement and
delivery. Neither undertakes to define the effect of such a
transfer.
We must, therefore, look outside of the statutes to learn
what they mean by declaring such instruments negotiable.
What is negotiability? It is a technical term derived from the
usage of merchants and bankers, in transferring, primarily,
bills of exchange and, afterwards, promissory notes. At common
law no contract was assignable, so as to give to an assignee a

'Oct. 1879.]

SHAW V. RAILROAD CO.

right to enforce it by suit in his own name. To this rule bills
of exchange and promissory notes, payable to order or bearer,
have been admitted exceptions, made such by the adoption of
the law merchant. They may be transferred by indorsement
and delivery, and such a transfer is called negotiation. It is
a mercantile business transaction, and the capability of being
thus transferred, so as to give to the indorsee a right to sue on
the contract in his own name, is what constitutes negotiability.
The term "negotiable" expresses, at least primarily, this mode
and effect of a transfer.
In regard to bills and notes, certain other consequences
generally, though not always, follow. Such as a liability of the
iudorser, if demand be duly made of the acceptor or maker,
and seasonable notice of his default be given. So if the indorsement be made for value to a bonafide holder, before the maturity of the bill or note, in due course of business, the maker
or acceptor cannot set up against the indorsee any defence
which might have been set up against the payee, had the bill
or note remained in his hands.
So, also, if a note or bill of exchange be indorsed in blank, if
payable to order, or if it be payable to bearer, and therefore
negotiable by delivery alone, and then be lost or stolen, a bona
fide purchaser for value paid acquires title to it, even as against
the true owner. This is an exception from the ordinary rule
respecting personal property. But none of these consequences
are necessary attendants or constituents of negotiability, or
negotiation. That may exist without them. A bill or note
past due is negotiable, if it be payable to order, or bearer, but
its indorsement or delivery does not cut off the defences of the
maker or acceptor against it, nor create such a contract as results from an indorsement before maturity, and it does not give
to the purchaser of a lost or stolen bill the rights of the real
owner.
It does not necessarily follow, therefore, that because a
statute has made bills of lading negotiable by indorsement and
delivery, all these consequences of an indorsement and delivery
of bills and notes before maturity ensue or are intended to
result from such negotiation.
Bills of exchange and promissory notes are exceptional in

SHAW v. RAILROAD

CO.

[Sup. Ct.

their character. They are representatives of money, circulating
in the commercial world as evidence of money, "of which any
person in lawful possession may avail himself to pay debts or
make purchases or make remittances of money from one country
to another, or to remote places in the same country. Hence, as
said by Story, J., it has become a general rule of the commercial world to hold bills of exchange, as in some sort, sacred
instrument in favor of bona fide holders for a valuable consideration without notice." Without such a holding they could not
perform their peculiar functions. It is for this reason it is held
that if a bill or note, endorsed in blank or payable to bearer, be
lost or stolen, and be purchased from the finder or thief, without
any knowledge of want of ownership in the vendor, the bonafide
purchaser may bold it against the true owner, lie may hold
it though he took it negligently, and when there were suspicious
circumstances attending the transfer. Nothing short of actual
or constructive notice that the instrument is not the property
of the person who offers to sell it; that is, nothing short of
mala fides will defeat his right. The rule is the same as that
'which protects the bona fide indorser of a bill or note purchased
for value from the true owner. The purchaser is not bound to
look beyond the instrument. Goodman v. Harvey, 4 Ad. & E.
870; Goodman v. Simonds, 20 How. 343; Hurrayl v. Lardner,
2 Wall. 110; Matthews v. Poythress,4 Ga. 287. The rule was
first applied to the case of a lost bank-note (Miller v. Race,
1 Burr. 452), and put upon the ground that the interests of
trade, the usual course of business, and the fact that bank-notes
pass from hand to hand as coin, require it. It was subsequently
held applicable to merchants' drafts, and in Peacock v. Blode8
(2 Doug. 633), to bills and notes, as coming within the same
reason.
The reason can have no application to the case of a lost or
stolen bill of lading. The function of that instrument is
entirely different from that of a bill or note. It is not a representative of money, used for transmission of money, or for the
payment of debts or for purchases. It does not pass from hand to
,band as bank-notes or coin. It is a contract for the performance
of a certain duty. True, it is a symbol of ownership of the goods
,covered by it, - a representative of those goods. But if the

Oct. 1879.]

SHAW v. RAILROAD C0.

goods themselves be lost or stolen, no sale of them by the finder
or thief, though to a 5ona fide purchaser for value, will divest
the ownership of the person who lost them, or from whom they
were stolen. Why then should the sale of the symbol or mere
representative of the goods have such an effect? It may be
that the true owner by his negligence or carelessness may have
put it in the power of a finder or thief to occupy ostensibly the
position of a true owner, and his carelessness may estop him
from asserting his right against a purchaser who has been misled to his hurt by that carelessness. But the present is no
such case. It is established by the verdict of the jury that the
bank did not lose its possession of the bill of lading negligently.
There is no estoppel, therefore, against the bank's right.
Bills of lading are regarded as so much cotton, grain, iron,
or other articles of merchandise,
The merchandise is very
often sold or pledged by the transfer of the bills which cover
it. They are, in commerce, a very different thing from bills of
exchange and promissory notes, answering a different purpose
and performing different functions. It cannot be, therefore,
that the statute which made them negotiable by indorsement
and delivery, or negotiable in the same manner as bills of
exchange and promissory notes are negotiable, intended to
change totally their character, put them in all respects on the
footing of instruments which are the representatives of money,
and charge the negotiation of them with all the consequences
which usually attend or follow the negotiation of bills and
notes. Some of these consequences would be very strange if
not impossible. Such as the liability of indorsers, the duty of
demand ad diem, notice of non-delivery by the carrier, &c., or
the loss of the owner's property by the fraudulent assignment
of a thief. If these were intended, surely the statute would
have said something more than merely make them negotiable
by indorsement. No statute is to be construed as altering the
common law, farther than its words import. It is not to be
construed as making any innovation upon the common law
which it does not fairly express. Especially is so great an
innovation as would be placing bills of lading on the same
footing in all respects with bills of exchange not to be inferred
from words that can be fully satisfied without it. The law has

SHAW V. RAILROAD Co.

[Sup. Ct.

most carefully protected the ownership of personal property,
other than money, against misappropriation by others than the
owner, even when it is out of his possession. This protection
would be largely withdrawn if the misappropriation of its
symbol or representative could avail to defeat the ownership,
even when the person who claims under a misappropriation
had reason to believe that the person from whom he took the
property had no right to it.
We think, therefore, that the rule asserted in Goodman v.
Harvey, Goodman v. Simonds, Mfurray v. Lardner (supra), and
in Phelan v. M11oss (67 Pa. St. 59), is not applicable to a stolen
bill of lading. At least the purchaser of such a bill, with
reason to believe that his vendor was not the owner of the bill,
or that it was held to secure the payment of an outstanding
draft, is not a bona fide purchaser, and he is not entitled to
hold the merchandise covered by the bill -against its true owner.
In the present case there was more than mere negligence on
the part of Miller & Brother, more than mere reason for suspicion. There was reason to believe Kuhn & Brother had no
right to negotiate the bill. This falls very little, if any, short
of knowledge. It may fairly be assumed that one who has
reason to believe a fact exists, knows it exists. Certainly, if
he be a reasonable being.
This disposes of the principal objections urged against the
charge given to the jury. They are not sustained. The other
assignments of error are of little importance. We cannot say
there was no evidence in the case to justify a submission to the
jury of the question whether Miller & Brother knew any fact
or facts from which they had reason to believe that the bill of
lading was held to secure payment of an outstanding draft. It
does not appear that we have before us all the evidence that
was given, but if we have, there is enough to warrant a submission of that question.
The exceptions to the admission of testimony, and to the
cross-examination of Andrew H. Miller, are not of sufficient
importance, even if they could be sustained, to justify our
reversing the judgment. Nor are we convinced that they exhibit
any error.
There was undoubtedly a mistake in entering the verdict. It

NATIONAL "BANK V. CARPENTER.

was a mistake of the clerk in using a superfluous word. The jury
found a general verdict for the plaintiff. But they found the
value of the goods " eloigned" to have been $7,015.97. The
word "eloigned" was inadvertently used, and it might have
been stricken out. It should have been, and it may be here.
The judgment was entered properly. As the verdict was
amendable in the court below, we will regard the amendment
as made. It would be quite inadmissible to send the case back
for another trial because of such a verbal mistake.
Judgment affirmed.
