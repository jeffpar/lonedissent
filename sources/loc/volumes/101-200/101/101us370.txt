PHELPS V. HARRIS.
1. A., although out of possession of certain lands in Mississippi, filed his bill under a statute of that State to remove a cloud upon his title to them. The
question of title was directly raised and litigated by the parties. The court
being of opinion that he was not entitled to any relief in the premises, dis.
missed the bill. A. thereupon brought ejectment against B., the defendant
in the former suit. Held, that the decree did not render the main controversy res judicata, as the court merely decided in effect that the bill would
not lie.
2. A power to "sell and exchange" lands includes the power to make partition
of them.
3. Where a testator devising land in Mississippi appointed a trustee with power
"to dispose of all or any portion of it" that might fall to the devisees and
"invest the proceeds in such manner as he might think proper for their
benefit," this court, without laying down as a general rule that the words
"dispose of" import a power to make partition, holds, in view of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Mississippi on the precise point in a case between the same parties, although not announced under such conditions as
made it resjudicata,that the trustee had power to make partition.
4. It is not a valid objection to the partition that the trustee authorized to make
it did not give his personal attention to it, but by agreement with one of
the heirs demanding it, submitted it to disinterested -persons, whose arbitrament he confirmed by executing the necessary indenture.
ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the

Southern District of Mississippi.
The facts are fully stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr-. G. Gordon Adam, for the plaintiffs in error.
Mr. William L. Nugent, contra.
MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This was an action of ejeetment for certain lands in Sharkie

County, Mississippi, brought by Alonzo J. Phelps and Mary B.
Phelps, his wife, the plaintiffs in error, against the defendants
in error, of whom George 0. Harris and Helen S. Harris, his
wife, were admitted to defend as landlords, the other defendants being their tenants in possession of the property in dispute. The principal question in the case is, whether Henry
W. Vick, father of the plaintiff, Mary B. Phelps, and trustee
under a deed made by his wife, Sarah, in 1850, and also trustee
under the will of his brother, -Grey Jenkins Vick, made in
1849, had authority under those instruments to make partition

of the lands given and devised therein to, and for the use of,
his children. If he had such authority, and exercised it in a
proper manner, the plaintiffs have no title, and the judgment
must be affirmed. If he had not such authority, or did not
exercise it effectually, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover
either all the land in controversy or an undivided part thereof,
and the judgment must be reversed. The facts of the case are
set out in a special finding of the court below.
By the deed of Sarah Vick, referred to (in which her husband joined), she conveyed certain lands of which she was
seised, to a trustee, to be held upon trust for her own separate
use for life, with remainder to her children in fee; subject to
certain powers of sale and exchange, and with the following
proviso : 1.Providedfurther,that said trustee is to permit the said Henry
W. Vick, as agent for said trustee, and as agent and trustee for
said Sarah Vick, during her life, and as agent and trustee for her
children after her death, to superintend, possess, manage, and control said property for the benefit of all concerned. Said Henry
W. Vick is to have power to sell and exchange said property after
the death of said Sarah Vick, and to apply the proceeds to the
payment of the debt due to the trustees of the Bank of the United
States; if such debt is paid, the proceeds of the sale to be rein
vested, and be subject to the trusts of this deed.'
The deed closes with this paragraph:

-

"My intention is that said Henry W. Vick shall he regarded,
for the purposes of this deed, not merely as an agent, but also a
co-trustee, and I desire he may be required to give no security
for the performance of his duties; and the said Jonathan Pearce
[the trustee] is not, in any manner, to be responsible for the acts
and conduct of said Henry W. Vick."
Sarah Vick died in 1850, leaving four children by her said
husband; viz., Mary B. Vick (now said Mary B. Phelps),
Henry G. Vick (under whom the defendants claim), Ann P.
Vick, and George R. C. Vick, all of whom were then under
age and unmarried.
By the will of Grey Jenkins Vick, referred to, the said Grey
devised certain lands and other property to the grandchildren

PHELPS V. HARRIS.

[Sup. Ct.

of his father and mother, among whom were the said children
of Henry W. and Sarah Vick, and constituted the said Henry
W. Vick trustee for his said children, giving him full power to
dispose of all or any portion of said property which might fall
to said children, and invest the proceeds in such manner as he
might think proper for their benefit. After the said Grey's
death, the said Henry W., as trustee of his said children, became seised in sevoralty by partition with the other devisees,
of the proportion of lands devised to his said children, upon the
trusts of the will.
In December, 1856, Henry G. Vick, the eldest of said four
children of Henry W. and Sarah Vick, became of age, and soon
after demanded from his father an account of his trust, and that
his portion of the property held under said deed and will should
be set off to him in severalty, and threatened to file a bill in
equity for that purpose. They finally agreed to leave the matter
to their attorneys, who decided that Henry G. Vick, having
become of age, had the right to demand a division of the property, and to have his share set off to him; and the said
attorneys signed a written instrument proposing the mode in
which such division should be made, to wit, through the intervention of disinterested persons to be chosen by the parties.
This plan was adopted; and Henry W. Vick and his son entered into a written agreement to that effect, designating the
persons for making the partition, and binding thfemselves to
stand to and abide by their decision. The arbitrators made
an award by which the lands in controversy in this suit were
allotted to said Henry G. Vick; an indenture was made between him and his father to carry the partition into effect;
and he remained in possession of the lands set off to him until
his death in May, 1859. It is this partition which is called in
question by the plaintiffs.
Henry G. Vick died without issue, having first made a will
by which he devised the lands in controversy, which were set
off to him as aforesaid, to Helen S. Johnston, now said Helen
S. Harris, who, after his death, went into possession thereof,
and has ever since continued in possession.
The contention of the plaintiffs is, that Henry W. Vick had
no authority, either under his wife's deed, or under the will of

Oct. 1879.]

PHELPS v. HARRIS.

Grey Jenkins Vick, to make partition of the lands, that the
partition made with Henry G. Vick was void, that he acquired
no separate estate thereby, and had no power to devise the
lands specifically, and that the plaintiff, Mary B. Phelps, as
sole surviving child of Henry W. and Sarah Vick (the others
having died without issue), is entitled to recover the property.
In pursuit of the supposed rights of Mary B. Phelps, the
plaintiffs, in February, 1871, exhibited a bill in the Chancery
Court of Washington County, Mississippi (in which the lands
in controversy were then situated), against the defendants,
George C. Harris and Helen his wife, to remove the cloud
from the supposed title of said Mary, raised by said partition
and the will of Henry G. Vick. The defendants relied on
the validity of said partition and will, and the question was
fully contested. In November, 1873, a decree was made dismissing the bill. An appeal was taken, and the Supreme
Court affirmed the decree. The plaintiffs then brought this
action of ejectment; and one of the questions in the cause is,
whether the decree in the chancery suit did not render the
controversy res judicata. The plaintiffs contended that it did
not, and that the only effect of the decree was, to decide that
a bill to remove the cloud from the title would not lie, leaving
the parties to all their legal rights in an action at law.
On this question the court below finds and concludes as
follows: "And the court here now finds as a fact, from an inspection
of the record in the said chancery cause, that the question as
to the validity of the partition of the lands aforesaid, made by
the said Henry W. Vick and the said Henry G. Vick under
the deed of the said Sarah Vick and the will of said Grey
J. Vick, and the power of said Henry W. Vick to make such
partition, as well as the validity of the devise made by the said
Henry W. Vick to the said Helen S. Harris, was directly raised
by the bill in said cause and litigated between the parties; and
that the said Supreme Court adjudged and decided that the
said partition and devise were both valid and effectual, and that
the said Henry W. Vick had full power and authority to make
the said partition with the said Henry G. Vick. Which decision so made by said court was done to determine the juris-

PHELPS V. HARRIS.

[Sup. Ot.

diction of the court in said cause, and that said Supreme Court
decided that the said Chancery Court had no jurisdiction
thereof, and that if the said complainants therein have any
right to the lands described therein, and which are the same
for which this action of ejectment is brought, it is a legal title
which must be enforced in an action at law."
The decree of the Chancery Court of Washington County,
which was affirmed by the Supreme Court, was in the following words: "The court being of opinion that the complainants
are not entitled to the relief prayed for in their bill, or to any
relief in the premises from this court, it is therefore ordered,
adjudged, and decreed that the said complainants' bill of complaint be and the same is dismissed, and that complainants pay
the costs, &c."
The bill was filed under a statute of Mississippi, which declared as follows: "When any person, not the rightful owner
of any real estate in this State shall have any deed or other
-evidence of title thereto, or which may cause doubt or suspicion in the title of the real owner, such real owner may file a
bill in the Chancery Court of the county in which the real
estate is situated, to have such deed or other evidence of title
cancelled, and such cloud, doubt, or suspicion removed from
said title, whether such real owner be in possession, or be
threatened to be disturbed in his possession or not, &c." Rev.
Stat. Miss., 1871, sect. 975, p. 191.
It is probable that the only effect of this statute was to
enable owners of land not in possession to file a bill for the
removal of clouds upon their title; since the ordinary jurisdiction of a court of chancery is sufficient to enable owners in
possession to file such a bill. The questions, what constitutes
such a cloud upon. the title, and what character of title the
complainant himself must have, in order to authorize a court
of equity to assume jurisdiction of the case, are to be decided
upon principles which have long been established in those
courts. Prominent amongst these are, first, that the title or
right of the complainant must be clear; and, secondly, that
the pretended title or right which is alleged to be a cloud upon
it, must not only be clearly invalid or inequitable, but must be
such as may, either at the present or at a future time, embar-

Oct. 1879.]

PHELPS V. HARRIS.

rass the real owner in controverting it. For it is held that,
where the complainant himself has no title, or a doubtful title,
he cannot have this relief. "Those only," said Mr. Justice
Grier, "who have a clear legal and equitable title to land connected with possession, have any right to claim the interference
of a court of equity to give them peace or dissipate a cloud on
the title." Orton v. Smith, 18 How. 263; and see Ward v.
Chamberlain,2 Black, 430, 444; West v. Schnebly, 54 Ill. 523;
Huntington v. Allen, 44 Miss. 654; Stark v. Starrs, 6 Wall.
402. And as to the defendant's title, if its validity is merely
doubtful, it is more than a cloud, and he is entitled to have it
tried by an action at law; and if it is invalid on its face, so
that it can never be successfully maintained, it does not amount
to a cloud, but may always be repelled by an action at law.
Overing v. .Foote, 43 N. Y. 290; Meloy v. .Dougherty, 16 Wis.
269. Justice Story says: "Where the illegality of the agreement, deed, or other instrument appears upon the face of it, so
that its nullity can admit of no doubt, the same reason for the
interference of courts of equity, to direct it to be cancelled or
delivered up, would not seem to apply; for in such a case,
there can be no danger that the lapse of time may deprive the
party of his full means of defence; nor can it, in a just sense,
be said that such a paper can throw a cloud over his right or
title, or diminish its security; nor is it capable of being used
as a means of vexatious litigation, or serious injury." 2 Eq.
Jur. sect. 700, a.
The Supreme Court of Mississippi, in their opinion in _Phelps
v. Harris (51 Miss. 789) a case between the present parties,
say: "This jurisdiction of equity cannot properly be invoked
to adjudicate upon the conflicting titles of parties to real estate.
That would be to draw into a court of equity from the courts
of law, the trial of ejectments. He who comes into a court of
equity to get rid of a legal title, which is allowed to cast a
shadow on his own title, must show clearly the validity of his
own title, and the invalidity of his opponent's. Banks v. Evans,
10 S. & M. 35; Huntington v. Allen, 44 Miss. 662. Nor will
equity set aside the legal title on a doubtful state of case. The
complainant, to enable him to maintain such a suit, must be
the real owner of the land, either in law or equity. Had the

PHELPS V. HARRIS.

[Sup. Ot.

defendant, Mrs. Harris, derived her title to the property in
controversy even from a doubtful exercise of power, that of
itself would be sufficient to preclude the complainants from a
resort to equity, upon the well-settled principles above laid
down. The proper forum to try titles to land is a court of
law, and this jurisdiction cannot be withdrawn at pleasure, and
transferred to a court of equity under the pretence of removing
clouds from title" (p. 793). The court further concludes that
this limited jurisdiction does not draw to it the right to take
jurisdiction of the whole controversy in relation to the title to
the land, right of possession, rents, &c., and thus usurp the
jurisdiction belonging to the courts of law.
It is true that the court, in the former part of its opinion,
discussed the question of the validity of the partition made by
H. W. Vick and his son, and held that the partition was good,
and that the title of Henry G. Vick to the lands in controversy
was perfect; and, as a consequence, that the defendant's title
was also perfect. But this discussion was entered into for the
purpose of showing that the title of the defendant was not so
devoid of validity as to constitute a mere cloud on the title;
and consequently that the case was not one in which a court
of equity could give relief.
We think, therefore, that the court below was right in determining that the decree in the equity case did not render the
main controversy res judicata, but only decided that the bill
would not lie; in other words, that it was not a proper case for
a court of equity to determine the rights of the parties.
This brings us to the merits of the controversy, involving the
question whether the partition made between Henry W. Vick
and his son Henry G. Vick was valid. The plaintiffs contend
that neither the deed of Sarah Vick, nor the will of Grey Jenkins Vick, gave to Henry W. Vick the power to make partition. The substance of -those instruments, so far as relates to
the question under consideration, has been recited. By the
deed of Sarah Vick, the trustee therein named was directed to
permit her husband, Henry W. Vick, as his agent, and as agent
and trustee for herself and her children, "to superintend, possess, manage, and control said property for the benefit of il
concerned." And it is added, "Said Henry W. Vick is to

Oct. 1879.]

PHELPS V. HARRIS.

have power to sell and exchange said property after the death
of said Sarah Vick, and to apply the proceeds to the payment
of the debt due to the trustees of the Bank of the United States;
if such debt is paid, the proceeds of the sale to be re-invested
and be subject to the trusts of this deed." The codicil to the
will of Grey Jenkins Vick, made Henry W. Vick a trustee for
his, Henry W. Vick's, children, and gave him full power to
dispose of all or any portion of the property devised by said
will, which might fall to said Henry's children, and to invest
the proceeds in such manner as he might think proper for their
benefit. These were the express powers granted. Henry G,
Vick, one of the children, came of age and demanded his portion separate from the rest. No question is made about his
right to have such division made. Had Henry W. Vick no
power to co-operate with him in making such a division? That
is the question. In the one case power is given to sell and exchange, superintend, possess, manage, and control for the benefit
of all concerned; in the other, full power to dispose of all or
any portion, and invest the proceeds in any manner he might
think proper for the children's benefit.
The question whether a naked power to sell or exchange
implies a power to make partition is discussed by Sir Edward
Sugden in his work on Powers. He says: "It is clear that a
power to make partition of an estate will not authorize a sale
or exchange of it; but it has frequently been a question amongst
conveyancers, whether the usual power of sale and exchange
does not authorize a partition, and several partitions have been
made by force of such powers under the direction of men of
eminence. This point underwent considerable discussion on
the title, which afterwards led to the case of Abell v. .eatoote,
4 Bro. 0. 0. 278; 2 Ves. Jun. 98. Mr. Fearne thought the
power did authorize a partition, on the ground that a partition
was in effect an exchange." Sugden adds, that the lords commissioners, Eyre, Ashurst, and Wilson, before whom the case
was first heard, all thought that the power was to receive a
liberal construction, as its object was to meliorate the estate.
Eyre thought, that upon the word 8ell, the trustees should have
a power of making partition, because it was in effect to take
quite a new estate. Ashurst and Wilson thought, that what-

378

PHELPS V. HARRIS.

[Sup. Ct.

ever power might be derived from the word sell, the other
words of the power, convey for an equivalent (which were also
used), were sufficient. But they made no decision. Upon the
cause coming before Lord Rosslyn, he determined that the
power was well executed, and founded his opinion upon its
being in effect an exchange, as the consequences and effects of a
partition and an exchange, as to the interests of the parties, are
precisely the same. Sir Edward then notices the decision of
Lord Eldon in the case of McQueen v. Farquhar(11 Ves. 467),
that a power to sell simply, does not authorize a partition. He
then adds: "Until the question shall receive further decision,
it can scarcely be considered clear that a power to exchange
will authorize a partition;" but he proceeds to show that the
decision in Abell v. Heathcote must have been based on the
power to exchange, and not on any additional words. After
referring to the case of Attorney-CGeneral v. Hamilton (1 Maddo
122), which was not decisive of the point, Sugden closes his
discussion by saying: "But, as Lord Rosslyn has observed,
this objection may be obviated where there is a power of sale.
The undivided part of the estate may be sold, the trustees may
teceive the money and then lay it out in the purchase of the
divided part, and although the sale is merely fictitious in order
to effect the partition, it should seem that the transaction cannot be impeached." 2 Sugden, Powers,479-482 (7th ed.), 1845.
We have quoted more largely from Sugden's work because
of his great authority on questions of real estate and equity.
It will be seen that he regards it as doubtful whether the
power to make partition is included in the power to sell and
exchange; but that partition may be effected indirectly under
the power to sell, by actually selling the undivided interest, and
purchasing a separate interest with the proceeds. The last
edition of Sugden on Powers, published in 1861, has no change
in the text on this subject.
In the case of Doe v. S tpencer (2 Exch. Rep. 752), decided
in 1848, Baron Rolfe, afterwards Lord Cranworth, speaking
for the court, held, in accordance with Mr. Preston's note to
Shepherd's Touchstone, p. 292, that two tenants in common
might effect a partition by the exchange of a moiety in one
'part for a moiety in the other part; and thence concluded that

Oct. 1879.]

PHELPS v. HARRIS.

a power of exchange given to trustees would be sufficient to
enable them to effect a partition with their co-tenant in this
way; although it was supposed that between more than two
parties it could not be done. Vice-Chancellor Kindersly, in a
subsequent case, reviewing this decision of the Court of Exchequer, well remarked, that if this can be done between two
tenants in common, there seems to be no good reason why it
may not be done between three or more.
The plaintiffs place great reliance on the case of Brassey v.
Ohalmers (16 Beav. 223), in which the master of the rolls held
that a power to sell and dispose did not give the power to
make partition; at least he refused to compel a purchaser to
accept a conveyance where such a partition had been made.
The case, however, was appealed, and the lords justices, without deciding the point, suggested the filing of a bill for partition, upon which the partition made night be confirmed, if
found beneficial. This course was adopted, and resulted in a
confirmation of the partition, and a decree confirming the title.
4 DeG. M. & G. 528; S. C., 81 Eng. L. & Eq. R. 115. So
that this case left the point still undetermined. This was in
1853, and no notice of the case is taken in the last edition of
Sugden on Powers, published in 1861.
A review of the cases and text-books on this subject was
made by Vice-Chancellor Kindersly in 1856 in the case of
Bradshaw v. Pane (2 Jur. N. S. 247), and the conclusion to
which he came was, that it was still doubtful whether a power
to sell and exchange would, or would not, authorize a partition.
The same thing is stated in Lewin on Trusts and Trustees,
3d ed., p. 417.
In a recent case, however, In re Frith and Osborne (3 Ch.
D. 618), decided in 1876 by Sir George Jessel, master of the
rolls, it was distinctly adjudged, after a masterly review of all
the previous authorities, that a power to sell and exchange
does include the power to make partition. In delivering his
judgment, the master of the rolls concludes as follows: "This
is the state of the authorities. Lord St. Leonards says that it
wants another decision to make it quite clear.. I am willing
to give the decision (supposing the doubt is not taken away
by the decision of the Court of Exchequer followed by the vice-

PHELPS v. HARRIS.

[Sup. Ot.

chancellor, Kindersly) that the passage in the Touchstone
[declaring that joint-tenants, tenants in common, and co-parceners cannot exchange the lands they do so hold, one with
another, before they make partition] is not good law, and that
you can have such an exchange, and if you can have such an
exchange, why could not the power authorize the exchange of
an undivided moiety in Whiteacre for another undivided
moiety in Blackacre ? I decide that it does. We have conflicting opinions between what the judges said in Doe v. Spencer and what the vice-chancellor intimated his opinion to be.
It is not necessary for me to decide that question. I must say,
if I had to decide it, I should be inclined to follow the opinion
of the vice-chancellor instead of the Court of Exchequer, for if
it can be done as between two, I do not see why it could not
be done as between more than two, but I have not to decide
that question now."
It would seem, therefore, to be finally settled in England,
that a power to sell and exchange does include the power to
make partition, and that all doubt on the subject has been
removed; and we have not been referred to any decisions in
this country which lead to a contrary result. This disposes of
the case so far as the power under the deed of Sarah Vick is
concerned.
The power given to the trustee by the codicil to the will of
Grey Jenkins Vick is not quite so clear. The testator constituted Henry W. Vick a trustee for his children, and gave him
full power to dispose of all or any portion of the property devised in the will that might fall to them, and invest the proceeds in such manner as he might think proper for their
benefit. The expression "to dispose of" is very broad, and
signifies more than "to sell." Selling is but one mode of disposing of property. It is argued, however that the subsequent
direction to invest thze proceeds indicates that a sale was meant.
But this does not necessarily follow. Proceeds are not necessarily money. This is also a word of great generality. Taking
the words in their ordinary sense, a general power to dispose of
land or real estate and to take in return therefor such proceeds
as one thinks best, will include the power of disposing of them
in exchange for other lands. It would be a disposal of the

Oct. 1879.]

PHELPS V. HARRIS.

lands parted with; and the lands received would be the proceeds. It is to be considered that the words used are contained
in a will, to which the rdles of construction applicable to ordinary speech are to be applied, except where technical terms
are employed. In a well-considered book on the construction
of wills, the rule of interpretation is laid down thus: 1. "In
construing a will, the words and expressions used are to be
taken in their ordinary,proper,and grammaticalsense; -unless
upon applying them to the facts of the case, an ambiguity or
difficulty of construction, in the opinion of the court, arises; in
which case the primary meaning of the words may be modified,
extended, or abridged, and words and expressions supplied or
rejected, in accordance with the presumed intention, so far as
to remove or avoid the difficulty or ambiguity in question, but
no farther." 2. "As a corollary to, or a part of, the last proposition, - teehnical words and expressions must be taken in
their technical sense, unless a clear intention can be collected
to use them in another sense, and that other can be ascertained." Hawkins, Construction of Wills, pp. 2, 4.
Now, whilst it may be true that when the words "disposed
of" are used in connection with the word " sell," in the phrase
"to sell and dispose of," they may often be construed to mean a
disposal by sale; it does not necessarily follow that when
power is given generally, and without qualification by associated words, to dispose of property, leaving the mode of disposition to the discretion of the agent, that the power should
not extend to a disposal by barter or exchange, as well as to a
disposal by sale. The word is nomen generalissimum, and
standing by itself, without qualification, has no technical signification. Taking the whole clause in the codicil together, it
is equivalent to an authority to dispose of the property as the
trustee should deem most for the interest of his children; and
this would include the power to barter or exchange as well as
the power to sell.
In re Frith and Osborne, already cited, the terms of the
power were "to sell, dispose of, convey, and assign the tenements, or any part thereof, by way of absolute sale for such a
price in money, or by way of exchange for such equivalent in
lands, as to the trustees should seem reasonable." The master

382

PHELPS V. HARRIS.

[Sup. ot.

of the rolls; in analyzibig this phraseology, said: "Of course
the word ' sell' refers to ' sale,' and the word ' exchange' refers
to ' dispose of,' and, therefore, it comes to this, whether a trust
including a power to dispose of by way of exchange for an
equivalent in other lands, authorizes trustees to dispose of the
undivided moiety, which they are empowered to dispose of,
for another undivided moiety." This quotation shows that the
words "dispose of" are properly applied to an exchange.
If this construction of the language of the will is correct,
the conclusion arrived at in relation to the power given by the
deed of Sarah Vick is applicable to that given by the will;
for, since it imports a power to exchange, it likewise imports a
power to make partition.
But without assuming to lay down as a general rule the interpretation which we have suggested, in view of the clearly
expressed opinion of the Supreme Court of Mississippi on the
precise point, we feel justified in adopting it in this case. In
disposing of the equity case on appeal, that court fully considered the power of the trustee, Henry W. Vick, both under the
deed and under the will, and came to the unanimous conclusion that he had full power and authority to make the partition in question. As to the power under the will the
court had no doubt, and as to that given by the deed they
relied on the authority of Abell v. Heatheote and the opinions
of Sugden and Fearne. And although this conclusion was
not embraced in the decree so as to become res judicata,
yet it was the ground on which the decree was rested. The
precise question before the court was, whether the power exercised by the trustee was or was not clearly in excess of powers
given by the instruments under which he assumed to act. The
court looked into these instruments, and said, without hesitation: "The trustee acted entirely within the scope of his
powers, and therefore it is not clear that he acted in excess of
those powers, but the contrary." Whilst the point adjudicated
was the conclusion that he had not clearly exceeded his powers,
the reason for that conclusion, namely, the decided opinion
that he had acted within the scope of his powers, was fairly
Within the inquiry presented for determination. The opinion
is not absolutely binding, it is true, but it is entitled to great

Oct. 1879.]

PHELPS V. HARRIS.

weight on the question as to the actual law of Mississippi, and
can hardly be called an extra-judicial opinion.
The objection that the trustee did not give his personal
attention to the division of the property, but, by agreement
with his son, submitted it to the arbitrament of disinterested
persons, we do not regard as sufficient to invalidate the transaction. It was confirmed and carried into effect by his executing the requisite indenture for that purpose. Had the matter
been carried into the courts a commission would have been
appointed to make the partition, in whose appointment the
trustee would have had less to say than he had in the selection
of the persons mutually chosen by himself and his son. And
it seems to us that the intervention of disinterested persons for
appraising the property and making the allotment was judicious and proper. It is the course most commonly pursued by
those who desire to make a division of property. It is laid
down as a rule that "trustees may justify their administration
of the trust fund by the instrumentality of others, where there
exists a moral necessity for it ; " and this is said to arise "from
the usage of mankind. If the trustee acts as prudently for the
trust as he would have done for himself, and according to the
usage of business; as, if a trustee appoint rents to be paid to a
banker at that time in credit, but who afterwards breaks, the
trustee is not answerable; so in the employment of stewards
and agents." Lewin on Trusts and Trustees, 3d ed., p. 293.
Again: "The trustee cannot without responsibility delegate
the general trust for sale; but there seems to be no objection
to the employment of agents by him, where such a course is
conformable to the common usage of business, and the trustee
acts as prudently for the cestui que trust as he would have done
for himself." Id. p. 422.
But this is rather a question affecting the responsibility of
the trustee than the validity of his acts. The trustee in this
case had power to make partition. lie did make partition, and
carried it out by executing the proper conveyance between himself and his co-tenant. The partition is valid, although the
trustee may be responsible for the manner in which it was
effected by him.
