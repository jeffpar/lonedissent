SCHOOL DISTRICT V. INSURANCE

[Sup. t

C0NIPANY.

1. The court announces its determination to insist upon a strict observance
by counsel of all rules intended to facilitate the examination of causes,
especially those submitted.
2. The submission of a cause under the 20th rule set aside for non-compliance
with paragraph 4, subdivision 3, of Rule 21, which provides that "when a
statute of a State is cited, so much thereof as may be deemed necessary to
the decision of the case shall be printed at length," either in or with the
brief.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Nebraska.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Submitted by Mr. -. Estabrook for the plaintiff in error, and
by Mr. Willard P. Hall for the defendant in error.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAIT, delivered the opinion of the
court.
This cause was submitted on the 6th of January under the
20th Rule. Its decision depends on a careful consideration of
several statutes of Nebraska. Rule 21 provides (par. 4, subdivision 3) that "when a statute of a State is cited, so much
thereof as may be deemed necessary to the decision of the case
shall be printed at length," either in or with the brief. That
rule has been entirely disregarded by both parties in this case.
For this reason the submission is set aside and the cause restored to its place on the docket.
We must insist on a strict observance by counsel of all rules
intended to facilitate our examination of causes, especially those
submitted. Although in general the statutes of the States are
to be found in the Congressional Library, we do not have them
at our rooms, where necessarily cases are investigated. A little
trouble on the part of counsel in obeying this particular rule,
will expedite materially our labors. We take this opportunity
of calling special attention to this subject.
