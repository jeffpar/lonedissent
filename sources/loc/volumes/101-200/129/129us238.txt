was wrought or unwrought metal, and also to that part which
stated that if the article was a mere excess of material in
making steel rails, it was not wrought metal in the sense of
the statute.
We are of opinion that the court erred in its disposition of
the case, and its charge to the jury The motion to direct a
verdict for the defendant, on the ground that the article was
not metal unwrought, not specially enumerated or provided for
in the statute, but was steel, specially enumerated and provided
for in the same statute, in a clause other than that regarding
metals unwrought, ought to have been granted. The article
fell within the definition of steel given in the statute. The
testimony showed that it was metal produced from iron or its
ores, by the Bessemer process, within the definition of the
articles which the statute stated should "be classed and
denominated as steel." It was none the less steel because it
was an excess of material, as the result of making steel rails,
cut off from the steel rail, and not suitable for use in itself,
without being remelted or reheated. The charge of the court
on this subject was subject to the exception and objection
made to it.
It results from these views that

delivered the opinion of the court.

The bill was brought by Sarah S. Sutton, the appellee,
against Erastus F Brown and Francis A. Kenyon, executors
of the last will of John S. Kenyon, and was in the nature of a
suit for specific performance of a contract and for the conveyance of the title to a certain house and grounds in the city of
Oconomowoc, in Wisconsin. There was no written agreement
on the subject, but the suit is based upon the idea of a verbal
promise or agreement upon the part of John S. Kenyon in his
lifetime that he would convey the property to Mrs. Sutton, the
appellee, and that such part performance had been had in its
execution as to bring the case within the exception made by
that doctrine in the requirement of the Statute of Frauds that
the sale of lands must be in writing.
The executors and trustees under the will filed their answer,
denying the existence of any verbal promise at all, and also
denying that it was so far performed as to justify'a decree.
The court, however, rendered a decree in favor of Mrs. Sutton,
that she was entitled to the property, and that the defendants

Opinion of the Court.

in the action should convey to her. It is from this decree that
the present appeal is taken.
A history of the relations of the testator, John S. Kenvon,
to Mrs. Sutton and her husband, is essential to a correct decision
of the case. The following facts regarding them are in the
main undisputed by either party
In 1868 Mr. Kenyon lived with his wife in Harlem, in the
city of New York, was a man of some wealth, an officer of a
bank in Harlem, and at his death left an estate of nearly
$200,000. He was without children or close kin in whom he
was much interested, as was shown by his will, in which, after
having made some slight provisions for some of his sisters, he
devised the great bulk of his fortune to fifteen charitable and
religious societies or associations. The father of Mrs. Sutton
lived in New York and Brooklyn, and she had been intimate
with Mr. Kenyon since her birth, being at the time of the trial
about forty-four years old. Prior to 1868 she married Charles
T. Sutton, and ever since lived with him as his wife, but had
no children. The wife of Mr. Kenyon Was for a very considerable period, certainly from 1868 to 1872, when she died, an
invalid, requiring much care and attention. Mrs. Sutton spent
a large part of her time, both before and after the date first
mentioned, with her, assisting in the care of her during sickness. In 1868 Mr. Kenyon and his wife visited Oconomowoc,
at the house of George F Westover, whose wife was a sister
of Mrs. Sutton. Thereafter the Kenyons removed to Tremont,
near New York City, where Mrs. Kenyon died in February,
1872. During a large part of this time, and at her death, Mrs.
Sutton was with her. Shortly after her decease, Mr. Kenyon
and Mr. and Mrs. Sutton went to Oconomowoc together, lived
in the family of Westover, paying therefor a consideration,
and so continued until April, 1874, except a few weeks, when
Mr. Kenyon was absent. Westover then removed to Chicago,
and on the 28th of that month Kenyon bought a cottage in
the village of Oconomowoc, and lived in it with the Suttons,
who kept the house. On July 1, 1874, Kenyon made a deed
of this cottage to Mrs. Sutton, declaring it to be in accordance
with the request of his wife during her lifetime, as a tribute

BROWN v. SUTTON.
Opnon of the Court.

from her to MIfrs. Sutton. For seven years these three continued
living together in that cottage, Kenyon making certain contributions for board, or as his quota towards the expenses of
housekeeping. During these years he made frequent trips to
New York on business connected with the bank of which he
was a shareholder and probably a director, being absent from
several weeks to three months at a time. While in New York
in 1879 upon one of these visits, he made a will, in which, after
disposing of several small items of personal property, giving
to Mrs. Sutton all the personal property in her house at
Oconomowoc, except his jewels, and the interest during her
life on one-third of $10,000, and to his sisters some slight
bequests of jewelry and furniture, the body of his estate was
bequeathed to his executors as trustees for the associations
referred to. In November, 1879, the Suttons closed the cottage and spent the winter in New York, in a house belonging
to Mr. Kenyon and furnished by him, the family consisting of
the same three persons and one servant. Thereafter they seem
to have vibrated for a year or two between the house in New
York and the cottage in Oconomowoc, always living together
as one family In September, 1880, Mr. Kenyon bought, for
the consideration of $2300, the premises in dispute in this
action, known as the "Oaks," situated in Oconomowoc, and
in 1881 began the erection thereon of a large dwelling-house.
Late in the fall of 1881 he went with the Suttons again to
New York, and they all resided together as usual in his house,
until he was stricken with apoplexy, and died m January
following.
The bill alleges that the property called the Oaks was
bought by Mr. Kenyon for Mrs. Sutton, that he had promised to buy it for her as a consideration for the services rendered to him, and to be thereafter performed, in keeping house
for him and giving him her care and society, and that he also
agreed to build thereon a new house, of sufficient dimensions
to accommodate others besides these three who lived together
as a family, so that if the necessity should arise, m event of
Mr. Kenyon's death, she might be enabled to make a living by
keeping boarders. It is claimed that the land was bought and

Opinion of the Court.

the house built in accordance with this promise, or at least that
it was in progress of erection at the time of his death. A
definite promise on his part to do this is asserted, the consideration for which was sufficient in what she had already done
and had agreed thereafter to do for him. Mr. and Mrs. Sutton were placed in possession of the premises as soon as the
purchase was made, and they were living there at the time the
present suit was brought.
The controversy in the present case isreally whether any
such promise or agreement was made, because if it was there
can be little doubt that the delivery of possession to the Suttons, and the construction of this house under their direction
and control, is a sufficient part performance to take the case
out of the Statute of Frauds.
As Mrs. Sutton was not competent as a witness to establish
a promise on the part of Mr. Kenyon to convey the property
to her, under § 858 of the Revised Statutes, and as Mr. Sutton,
being her husband, was also incompetent, it can be readily
seen, in the absence of any written agreement upon the subject or any correspondence between the parties, which could
not reasonably be expected to exist as they were nearly always
living together, that it is almost impossible to prove a direct
verbal promise from Mr. Kenyon to her in regard to that
matter. Any such promise must be largely inferred from the
situation and circumstances of the parties, and must depend
almost wholly on verbal statements made by Mr. Kenyon to
others.
The depositions in the case contain full and ample evidence
of the declarations of Mr. Kenyon on this subject. They are
in substance, that he had bought the property for Mrs. Sutton,
that he had given it to her, had placed her in possession of the
ground, and was building a house upon it for her at the time
of his death, and that he treated her and her husband as, and
frequently called them, his "children," or "the children."
There can be no question that Mr. Kenyon bought the
property in dispute with the intention, clear and well defined
in his own mind, that he was buying it for Mrs. Sutton, and
when he came to build the house upon it there can be as little

BROWN v. SUTTON.
Opinion of the Court.

doubt that he erected it for her with the intention that it
should be her house, expecting to live with the Suttons as
long as he lived, and that it would go to her in the event of
his dying before she did. It may be said, and it istrue, that
this unexecuted purpose of his is not of itself sufficient to
constitute a contract to convey to her the house, nor would it,
alone be a sufficient foundation for a decree, but it leaves the
case in such a position that no very strong evidence is required
that such a contract did exist, as it would be entirely consistent with all the other uncontradicted testimony in regard to
what he had said and done and with the possession of the
property by her. There is also quite a sufficient consider9tion
for such a promise in the services, care and attention rendered
by her to an old man in his declining years, in connection
with the fact that at the time he bought this property he was
very sure of receiving these attentions as long as he lived.
The evidence shows that this expectation on Is part was fully
realized. Let us examine briefly the positive evidence of a
promise on this subject.
We have the testimony of Mr. Westover, whose relation to
Mr. Kenyon and the family has already been noted, in whose
house they lived for two summers prior to his removal to
Chicago, and who seems to have been on intimate terms with
Mr. Kenyon, that he had many conversations with him about
his private matters, although he was not a man who talked
generally about his affairs. He states that Mr. Kenyon was
not well, and never was well, since he first went to Oconomowoc, that he was a pretty old man, at least old enough tobe Mrs. Sutton's father, and probably older than her own
father was, that he needed a great deal of nursing, and
wanted more care and attention when near her in the little.
details of life than any man he ever saw, that he seemed to
dread to be alone, and in fact she went everywhere with him,
and devoted the most of her life during those years to him as
a daughter to a father. He says "She filled the place that
an exceedingly attentive daughter would to a weak, sickly,
old father. I never saw a case in a family of more marked
service in that line than was that case. No person but Mrs.

Opinion of the Court.

Sutton was relied upon to look after his personal wants at
all."
The witness then went on to state a conversation that he
had with Mr. Kenyon about his affairs, in which he said of
his relatives "All they want of me is my money, some day
they will be terribly disappointed," and proceeded to say
that no one had filled the place of a relative to him as had
Mrs. Sutton, that he was under great obligations to her, and
how to discharge it, to repay her, or attempt to repay her,
was something that be was considering, and that he was going
to recompense her for her services to him in some way After
the purchase of the property in dispute here, Westover asked
Mir. Kenyon about it, and gives his language as follows "He
told me then that that was the final result of his determination as to Mrs. Sutton, that he had bought the place for her;
that she wanted it, and he had made up his mind that it was
the very best that could be done, and he hadprommsed her that
he would put a house on the place, such as she wanted, and
the place should be hers. He said that it was not perhaps as
much as Mrs. Sutton was really entitled to, but he thought
that after all it would be better for her than if she should be
provided for in some other way that would be even larger.
He said that he had made her home his home, as I knew, and
it was understood that he was to continue thereafter making
his home with Sortie, that is, Mrs. Sutton."
Mr. Kenyon then went on to say, as the witness states, that
by having a fine building on the place she would be able, if
anything should happen to him, to take care of herself by
keeping boarders, and continued
"The houge will be such as Mrs. Sutton wants. I have
agreed that Sortie shall have the house just exactly as she
wants it, just to suit her. He said he was to continue to
make his home with Mr. and Mrs. Sutton, and that in view
of the past and her services to him, and what had been done,
and in view of the position which she was occupying as to
him, and the services she had performed and was still to perform, he had _yromsed her that place, and he had bought it
for her because it pleased her, and he had promised to build
such a house thereon as she should want."

BROWN v. SUTTON.
Opinion of the Court.

If this statement be true, here is at once the promise and
the consideration for it, amounting to an agreement stated in
Mr. Kenyon's own language, with all the clearness of detail
necessary to a contract. There was no question about the
property to be conveyed, the promise to build the house, the
parties to the agreement, or the consideration for the promise.
The witness then details a conversation which he had in
1881, in which Mr. Kenyon reminded him of what he had said
to him before on the same subject, and said that after much
thought he had concluded that was the best arrangement, and
she had agreed to it, that it was arranged between them that
he should continue to live with her in the future, that he was
under obligations to her for what she had done for him mdividually, and that he had made arrangements with her and
she would continue to do for him as she had done, and he had
promsed to buy thatylaee for her and fXx it up and deed it to
her The witness then testified as to the board paid by Mr.
Kenyon, and said "I understood from him, as he said, that
the services of Mrs. Sutton which she had rendered him, and
which he was under obligations to requite, together with those
of the same kind which she had agreed to perform in the
future, were the basis of hmrommse to convey her the premsses
,n dispute, and were outside of anything which he had furnished in cash expense of living."
Julia L. White, who was well acquainted with Mr. Kenyon,
details various conversations with him, in one of which he
said that he wanted to give the property which is now in
controversy to Mrs. Sutton, for she had taken care of him and
had promised and was to continue to take care of him as long
as he lived, and that he then said he had prommsed to gnxe it td'
her. She testifies that Mr. Kenyon stated to her that he
desired to purchase this property for Mrs. Sutton on account
of the services and care she had already given to him, and had
prorntsedto gmve hem, and that he said on Wednesday before
his death that he had bought the place, that it was for Mrs.
Sutton, to make her home there for the care she had given
him and for the care she promised to take of him until his
death.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Small, who lives adjoining the property in dispute,
details a long conversation he had with Mr. Kenyon in regard
to the building of the house, and states that he said "I am
not building it for myself, I am building it for Mrs. Sutton."
Mr. Kenyon then went on to say that he did not want to be
bothered with the building of it, he had left it all to Mr. and
Mrs. Sutton, he had nothing to do with the building except
to furnish the money, that the rooms had all been arranged
by her, and that he intended she should have it as she
wanted it. lie states that he asked Mr. Kenyon, in whom the
title was, whether it was in Mrs. Sutton at that time, and he
replied 'KNo, when the the property was bought I took the
deed, but I intend to have the property all fixed in Mrs. Sutton." "I said, 'H aven't you done anything about it yet 9'
Ile said, ' No.' Said I, 'You may have it in your mind to do
something you want to do, but if you do not do it, if you
should be taken away, it won't be done. Under our law,
unless there is a writing made, or the parties put in possession
under the agreement, it won't amount to anything.' He said,
'I can't make anything out here for the reason my papers are
in New York. I desire to make some alterations in my affairs.
Then I shall fix it up, but I shall put them in possession. I
have put them in possession. Mrs. Sutton has had possession
ever since I went to New York in the summer. I turned it
over to them then, and they are now in possession. Mrs. Sutton has the keys to the little house and all the property, and I
intend they shall be in possession, and are in possession just as
perfect as I can make it. If I had my papers here I should
have them altered now I have my attorney down there. I
-don't want to do anything until I get down there.' He said,
' I propose to give it to them. Mrs. Sutton has been very
kind to me in sickness and disease in my family, took care
of my wife until she died. I have a good home myself with
them. I propose now to repay them in this way "' The witness also testifies as to other conversations, m which Mr. Kenyon declared that the keys and the possession were in the Suttons, that the property was theirs to all intent and purposes,
that the title was taken in his name when he bought the prop-

erty, but that he intended Mrs. Sutton should have it, and that
he frequently spoke of them as "the children."
Mrs. Williams, an insurance agent, while examining the
house at the request of Mrs. Sutton, with reference to a policy,
met Mr. Kenyon on the premises. He showed her over the
house and directed her attention to certain alterations that the
Suttons had made in the plan, and said "It is as they want
it, it is the children's, it don't make any difference to me how
they fix it." And again she states that he said m regard to
the gables ihat he would have made every one different, but
the children (a phrase which he often used with reference to
Mr. and Mrs. Sutton) wanted it so, and it did not make any
difference to him, " i t was thezrs."
To William K. Washburn, who was working about the
grounds, Mr. Kenyon said that he was fixing it up for Mr.
and Mrs. Sutton, that it was their place, and they were in
possession.
In regard to some of the details, Mr. Eastman, another witness, testified that Mr. Kenyon said he had nothing to do with
the building of it, that Mr. Sutton was building it for himself.
Mr. Anderson, a resident of Oconomowoc, testifies that he
asked Mr. Kenyon, in a conversation that they had about the
place now in dispute, if he felt anything like a Granger, and
that his reply was that he could not say he did, as he did not
buy the place for himself, but had bought it for Mrs. Sutton,
who undoubtedly would be a permanent resident, although he
should make it his home with them while there, as he had for
several years made their place his home. In another conversation, 2r. Kenyon said to him that the building was much
larger than they intended in the start, but he was building it
entirely for Mrs. Sutton, and it had been enlarged at her sug:
gestion, that Mr. Sutton had the entire control, and he had
authorizeduhim to build and finish it and make the improvements exactly as Mrs. Sutton wished. On his cross-examination he testified that Mr. Kenyon said he had bought it, but
not for himself, that he had bought it for Mrs. Sutton, and
they would make it a permanent residence, and he should
make it his home with them whenever he was there.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

Celestia Edwards testifies to a conversation with Mr. Kenyon about the property, in which he remarked that they would
have a very beautiful place and home there, to which he
replied that he liked it very well, but it did not make any
difference to him, "it was all theirs, it was the children's,
they were fixing it up just to suit themselves."
Clarence I. Peck also testifies to a conversation about this
place, in which Mr. Kenyon said that he intended to finish it
up in good style for "the children," as he called them, meaning Mr. and Mrs. Sutton, and also that he said on another
occasion "The place belongs to Charlie and Sortie, anyhow,
and I thought I would give the job of superintending it to
Charlie."
Some comment is made that the most direct testimony on
the subject of a promise comes from the sister and brother-inlaw of the plaintiff, but there is nothing to discredit their evidence, no impeachment of their character is attempted, nor is
it shown that they are in any way dependent upon her. No
reason is given why they should state anything false, and their
testimony iswholly uncontradicted. It isalso consistent with
all the circumstances of the case.
It is further made a subject of comment that Mrs. Sutton
did not make claim to the title to this property, nor bring this
suit for two or three years after the death of Mr. Kenyon, but
it is easy to suppose that she really believed that for want of
a written promise or agreement she could not enforce her right
to the property While this principle of the necessity for a
written agreement in regard to the title to real property is
almost universally understood among all classes of people, however unlearned in the law, it is not very well known that there
is an exception to it in the case of a promise, not in writing,
but so far performed as to take it out of the Statute of Frauds.
On the whole, we think that the evidence justifies the inference that Mr. Kenyon, having a clear intention that this property should belong to Mrs. Sutton, bought it for her, and also
promised her that he would make over the title to her upon
consideration that she should take care of him during the
remainder of his life as she had done in the past.
