SARGENT v. COVERT.
APPEAL FROM

THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 298. Argued March 19, 1894. -Decided

April 2, 1894.

The alleged invention, protected by letters patent No. 161,757, dated April
6, 1875, issued to James C. Covert for " improvement in clasps or
thimbles for hitching devices," did not involve such an exercise of the
inventive faculty as entitled it to protection.

THIs was a bill filed by James C. Covert against Joseph B.
and George H. Sargent in the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Southern District of New York for infringement of letters patent No. 161,757, dated April 6, 1875, issued
to complainant for "improvement in clasps or thimbles for
hitching devices," upon which a final decree was entered
adjudging the patent to be good and valid; that the defendants had infringed the same; and that complainant should
recover of the defendant Joseph B. Sargent the sum of $750,
and of the defendant George H. Sargent, $250; and costs.
From this decree an appeal was taken to this court.

delivered the opinion of the

SARGENT v. COVERT.
Opinion of the Court.

The patent in suit was issued April 5, 1875, and relates to
a device used upon rope halters. That device consists of
a tube adapted to slip upon a rope, and having on one of its
sides an enlargement with interior screw-threads. A sharppointed screw is fitted to pass through the projection at right
angles to the bore of the tube so as to enter the rope and hold

the tube fast in any given position upon it. This set screw is
provided with an eye for the reception of a snap-hook on the
end of the hitching rope whereby a loop may be formed to
pass around the neck or other part of the animal; the size of
the loop being determined by the position of the thimble
or tube on the rope.
The specification is accompanied by a drawing, in which
Figure 1 was a perspective view, and Figure 2, a longitudinal
section, of the alleged invention, Figure 2 being as follows:

0x

This is thus described in the specification: "A represents
a thimble of any suitable dimensions provided on one side
with a nut or enlargement, a, having a hole through it with
female screw-threads. The thimble A is fastened on the rope
B at any desired place by means of a sharp-pointed screw,
Cx, which passes through the thimble at the nut a and the
rope. This screw is provided with a round eye, D, for the
reception of a snap-hook."
I The claim is: "The combination of the tube A, having
the projection a, with interior screw-threads cast therewith,
and the screw 0, having the eye D and the sharp point x, for
entering into the rope, all constructed as and for the purposes
set forth."
The file wrapper and contents showed that the original

claim was: "The combination of the thimble A, rope B, and
sharp-pointed screw 0, provided with the eye D, substantially
as, and for the purposes herein set forth;" but the projection
a in the claim allowed was not an essential qualification, and
complainant insists that the words "cast therewith" do not
refer to the "interior screw-threads," and only appear to do
so through erroneous punctuation. Defendants' screw-threads
were made with a tap in the ordinary way.
In support of the defence of invalidity, defendants introduced a patent issued to John Wiard, June 9, 1868, for an
"improvement in cattle tie," in the drawings accompanying
which, Figure 2 represented "the adjustable socket of the
halter," as follows:

0
This was described in the specification in these words:
"B is a socket, constructed so as to pass freely over the rope,
as in Fig. 1, and in one side of which is fitted a thumb
screw, 0, so that when the said thumb screw is turned hard
down upon the rope, the socket will be held firmly in that
position, and may be adjusted to different positions on the
rope by loosening the screw, and sliding the socket accordingly. The head of the thumb screw 0 is constructed with
a hole, D, at each end, so as to form a means of attachment
of the end of the rope thereto."
Comparing these two figures, it will be seen that they are
alike except that the end of the screw in the patent sued on
is sharpened and the screw has but one eye, whereas the end
of the screw in the Wiard patent is blunt and it is provided
with two eyes. And these are the particular differences
pointed out by complainant's expert, who also testified on
cross-examination that if the end of the screw in the Wiard
socket were made substantially like the sharpened point x of

SARGENT v. COVERT.
Opinion of the Court.

the Covert patent, that would be, in his opinion, an infringement. According to his view, the most essential advantage
of the invention in suit was that which resulted from having
the end of the screw sharpened instead of flat, though, he
added, "there are advantages in having a single eye to the
screw, instead of a double one;" but nevertheless, that he did
not "think the use of a double eye instead of a single one
would evade the charge of infringement."
The advantages resulting from sharpening the point of the
screw were stated by him to be "a sharp-pointed screw will
enter the material of which the rope is composed and hold
the thimble in a positive manner, and this is true even if the
screw becomes slightly slackened; a flat-ended screw simply
holds by frictional contact, and if the screw is slightly slackened does not prevent the thimble from being slipped out of
place."
It appeared that the Wiard socket as actually made and
sold had a convex end; that conical-pointed screws were in
common use prior to the patent in suit; that complainant
was acquainted with prior devices, including that of Wiard,
and sought to improve upon them; and that the sales of his
device were large.
Reference was made on the argument to testimony adduced
on behalf of complainant tending to show an essential
mechanical difference between the two devices in the use of
one eye centrally located in the one, and the use of two eyes,
each placed one side of the centre, in the other, and it was
contended that the former was superior in that the latter was
more exposed to being struck and unscrewed, and also exposed
to the liability of the attaching hook being snapped "into the
wrong eye, especially at night and in the dark, which is constantly the case during the winter months, when much of the
caring for stock is done after nightfall."
But be this as it may, the claim of the patent was not
limited to the use of a single eye, and it is apparent that the
only material difference between the patented thimble and the
Wiard socket to be considered is that the screw of the one had
a rounded end and the other a sharpened point, while the

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.

difference of operation is manifestly that a sharpened point
will enter a material upon which it is directed, further than
a rounded point. We cannot perceive in the recognition of
the fact that facility of penetration is greater in a sharpened
point than in a blunt one, any such evidence of invention as
is sufficient to sustain this patent. Moreover, the Wiard screw,
which is rounded at its end, is shown to enter the rope when
screwed down hard, and in respect of the engagement between
the rope and the socket or thimble to operate in the same way
as the patented thimble. In other words, it holds by something more than frictional contact. Each of these screws
compresses the rope within the socket, but the Covert screw,
being sharpened, penetrates further than the other. The
change is in degree and not in function.
We think the evidence fails to show that the Wiard socket
was not a practicable and successful article, and agree with
the remark of Judge Wallace in his opinion overruling the
exceptions to the master's report, (38 Fed. Rep. 237, 238,)
that: "The patented articles are not so superior to the other
fastening devices as to give rise to any cogent presumption
that those who purchased them of the defendants would have
bought them of the plaintiff in preference to the other devices,
and without reference to the difference in price, if they could
not have bought them elsewhere."
We are of opinion upon this record that the alleged improvement was such a one as would have occurred to any one
practically interested in the subject, and that it did not involve
such an exercise of the inventive faculty as entitled it to
protection.
The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded with a direction to dismiss the bill.
MR. JUSTIOE JACxsoN did not hear the argument, and took
no part in the decision of this case.
