BURCK v. TAYLOR.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
No. 170. Argued December 15,1893.--Decided April 9, 1694.

S. contracted with the State of Texas, in writing, January 18, 1882, to build
a new capitol building for it for an agreed compensation, and not to
assign the contract without the consent of the State. On the 31st of
January, 1882, S., with the consent of the State, assigned an undivided
three-fourths interest in the contract to F., G., and T., who were partners.
On the same day, without the consent or knowledge of the State, S. assigned to B., C., and D., each one-fourth of the one-fourth interest remaining in him. On the 9th of May, 1882, S. conveyed to F., G., and T. all the
right and interest which he had in and under the contract, and the State
gave its assent to this transfer on the 10th of May. It did not appear
that the assignees in the last conveyance knew of the transfer to B., C.,
and D. On the 20th of June, 1882, F. and G. transferred, with the consent of the State, all their interest in the contract to T., who then performed the work to the satisfaction of the State, and received the agreed
compensation therefor. On the 1st of April, 1883, D. transferred to E.
the interest in the contract which had been transferred to him, January
31, 1882, and on the 27th of May, 1884, he transferred the same interest to
T. Most of these conveyances were filed and recorded in the office of
the county clerk for Travis County,Texas, and some were filed in the
office of the comptroller of public accounts of the State. In a suit
brought by E. against T. to recover what he claimed to be his share of
the profits under the contract, Held,
(1) That it was not competent for S., by his own act, and without the
consent of the State, to transfer any interest in the contract;
(2) That all that could have been acquired by an assignment by S. without the consent of the State was a right to maintain an action
against S. for the share of the profits which he had attempted to
transfer;
(3) That when the contract was transferred to T., who was accepted by
the State in lieu of the original contractor, T. entered upon its
performance free from any disposition of the profits made by the
original contract;
(4) That the filing of an instrument for record in a public office of the
State, for the record of which the statutes of the State made no
provision, carried with it no notice to other parties.

BURCK v. TAYLOR.
Statement of the Case.

ON December 8, 1888, appellant filed his petition in the
District Court of Travis County, Texas, to recover of defendant the sum of $231,417, alleged to be his share of the profits
of the contract made with the State of Texas for the building
of its capitol. The suit thus commenced was thereafter removed to the United States Circuit Court for the Western
District of Texas, and on Oct9ber 7, 1889, upon leave obtained,
the plaintiff filed an amended bill. To this bill, on November
4, defendant demurred. On March 4, 1890, the demurrer was
sustained, and the plaintiff electing to stand upon his bill and
declining to amend it, a decree was entered dismissing the
same with costs. From such decree of dismissal the plaintiff
appealed to this court. The matters set forth in the bill are
as follows: On January 18, 1882, the State of Texas, by
Joseph Lee and N. L. Norton, capitol commissioners, with the
approval of 0. M. Roberts, governor, made and executed a
contract with Matthias Schnell for the erection of the capitol
building, according to certain plans and specifications; Schnell
to furnish all the material and do all the work, and the State,
as the consideration therefor, to convey 3,000,000 acres of
land. The twenty-sixth clause of the contract is as follows:
"It is further agreed, covenauted, and stipulated by the
party of the second part that this contract shall not be assigned, in whole or in part, by the party of the second part
without the consent, in writing, of the party of the first part,
signed by the governor of Texas and the capitol building
commissioners, with the advice and consent of the heads of
departments."
On January 31, 1882, Matthias Schnell, Charles B. Farwell,
John V. Farwell, Amos C. Babcock, and the defendant, Abner
Taylor, entered into a contract by which Schnell assigned and
set over to the other parties an undivided three-fourths interest
in said contract. The material portions of this contract are
as follows:
"It is hereby agreed by and between the parties hereto
that the said Matthias Schnell shall assign and set over, and
by these presents does assign and set over, to the parties of
the second part an undivided three-fourths (1) interest in said

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Statement of the Case.

contract for the purpose that the said parties of the second
part may share in any and all the profits that may arise from
same, the same as the party of the first part, as their interests
may appear, which is hereby agreed to be equal.
"And it is understood and agreed by and between the
parties hereto that the parties of the second part are to furnish whatever money may be needed or necessary for the proper
construction of said state-house or for the execution of the
said contract as the same may be required from time to time.
"It is further agreed and understood by and between the
parties hereto that the said Matthias Schnell shall have the
management and superintendence of the building and construction of said state-house from the commencement to its
completion, subject to the direction and control of the majority
in interest herein, at a salary of five thousand ($5000) dollars
per annum, payable monthly.
"And it is further agreed that the said superintendent
shall be personally responsible to the parties of the second
part for any loss or damages caused or sustained by reason of
his neglect or mistakes in prosecution of his duties as such
superintendent, wilfully done.
"And it is hereby understood and agreed that this agreement shall be binding and operative from the date of its
approval by the governor of Texas and the heads of departments."
In accordance with clause 26 of the original contract, the
following consent to the assignment was endorsed on the
back:

On January 31, 1882, Schnell made an agreement with
James Mv.Beardsley, James S. Drake, and A. A. Burck,
which, after referring to the prior contracts, purported to be
an assignment and transfer to each of the three of an undivided one-fourth of the one-fourth interest in the contract
remaining in Schnell. This contract, although signed and
acknowledged by all four of the parties, was without the consent in writing of the State of Texas. Afterwards, and on
May 9, 1892, Schnell executed in writing a further assignment
in the following language:
"THE STATE OF TEXAS,

On June 20, 1882, the firm of Taylor, Babcock & Co. assigned and transferred the entire contract to Abner Taylor,
the language of the transfer being as follows:

It further appears that the instrument dated January 31,
by which Schnell transferred a three-fourths interest in the
contract to the two Farwells, Babcock, and Taylor, was filed
for registration on February 13, in the office of the clerk of
the county court of the county of Travis, that being the
county in which the capitol building was situated, and thereafter recorded in the records of said county; that the instrument executed between Schnell, Drake, Beardsley, and Burck
was also filed and recorded in the same office on February 14,
1882; likewise the assignment of May 9, 1882, from Schnell
to Taylor, Babcock & Co. on May 10, 1882, and the deed

and Babcock, of date May 27, 1884, on May 27, 1884. It also
appears from the certificate of the comptroller of public
accounts of the State of Texas that the original contract of
the State with Schnell, together with the assignment from
Schnell to the two Farwells, Babcock, and Taylor, of date
January 31, the assignment, of date May 9, from Schnell to
Taylor, Babcock & Co., and the assignment from Taylor,
Babcock-& Co. to Abner Taylor, were all on file in his office,
though when so filed is not stated. With reference to the

BUROK v. TAYLOR.
Statement of the Case.

effect of the filing in the office of the clerk of Travis County,
the bill avers as follows:
"And your orator further says that the account between
your orator and defendant as to this matter is still open and
unsettled, and that for reason why your orator should not
have an account or relief against him the defendant pretends
that he had no notice that the said A. A. Burck assigned or
transferred to your orator a one-half interest in his, the said
A. A. Burck's, one-sixteenth interest in the profits that might
arise from the building of said capitol contract, and that the
defendant in good faith and without notice purchased from
said A. A. Burck for a valuable consideration the said Burck's
one-sixteenth interest in said profits after the said A. A. Burck
had sold one-half of his said interest to your orator, and therefore refuses to account with plaintiff; whereas the truth is
that the said transfer by A. A. Burck to your orator, which
has been hereinbefore stated and made a part of this bill as
an exhibit, was duly authenticated for registration in the office
of the county clerk, and was duly recorded in the records of
deeds of Travis County, Texas, on the 14th day of April, A.D.
1883, and said Abner Taylor then had notice of the same;
whereas the said A. A. Burck did not sell or transfer any of
his said interest in said profits to said Abner Taylor until the
27th day of May, 1884.
"That the said Abner Taylor ought not to be heard to aver
that said registration was not notice to him of the said assignment by A. A. Burck to your orator, for that the formation
of the copartnership between Matthias Schnell, Abner Taylor,
Amos C. Babcock, Charles B. Farwell, and John V. Farwell,
as hereinbefore alleged, wherein it was stipulated that the
profits arising from building the capitol should be divided
between said parties or with the assignees of either party, the
said copartnership caused said contract of copartnership, which
contained an assignment by said Schnell of three-fourths of
his interest in said capitol contract, to be recorded in the
register of deeds of Travis County, whereupon the said A. A.
Burck, J. M. Beirdsley, and James S. Drake, acting on this
means of giving notice of assignments adopted by said part-

nership, caused their said assignment to be recorded in the
office of the clerk of the county court of Travis County in the
records of deeds; and afterwards, when the said Schnell as-

signed his remaining interest in said contract and in the profits
that might arise from the fulfilment of the same to the other
members of said firm styled Taylor, Babcock & Co., the said
firm caused said last-mentioned assignment to be also recorded
in the said register of deeds as a means of giving notice
thereof; that when the said firm of Taylor, Babcock & Co.
and the individual members thereof assigned their interests
in said contract to Abner Taylor, the defendant herein, they
and said Taylor in their contract of assignment referred to
the several mesne assignments of interests in said contract as
being of record in the office of the clerk of the county court
of Travis County, and referred to said records for full particulars as to said mesne assignments, whereby the said parties
concerned in said contract for building said capitol building
agreed and established a custom among themselves to give
notice of assignments of interests in said capitol contract or
in the profits that might arise from the fulfilment of the same
by recording such assignments in the records of deeds of Travis
County, Texas, and by their conduct in so recording such assignments, and referring to said records and not otherwise
giving notice of such assignments led your orator to believe
and justified him in believing that said partnership and its
assigns would take notice of the assignment by said A. A.
Burck to your orator when your orator placed the same on
record in the records of deeds of Travis County, duly authenticated for record; that your orator, fully believing that such
record would be accepted as notice of the said assignment to
your orator, caused his said assignment to be promptly recorded in the records of deeds of Travis County on the 14th
day of April, 1883, which was more than a year before the
said Abner Taylor purchased any interest from the said A. A.
Burck."
And with regard to the rights acquired by defendant,
through the conveyance of May 27, 1881, from A. A. Burck
to him, it avers as follows:

BURCK v. TAYLOR
Opinion of the Court.

"And your orator further says that said assignment by
A. A. Barck to Abner Taylor did not purport on its face to
sell or assign to said Taylor the interests in the profits of said
capitol contract which the said A. A. Burck had assigned to
your orator, but only purported to assign to said Taylor whatever interest the said A. A. Burck had at the time of the
said assignment to Abner Taylor, or might thereafter have;
wherefore the said Abner Taylor, defendant, was placed upon
notice and inquiry as to whether A. A. Burck had parted with
any of his interest before the assignment of his remaining interest to the said Abner Taylor, but the said Abner Taylor
made no inquiry of said A. A. Burck as to whether he had
parted with any of his, the said Burck's interest, nor did the
said Taylor examine or cause to be examined the records of
deeds of Travis County for any record of an assignment by
said A. A. Burck, notwithstanding the said custom and practice of all the parties concerned in assignments affecting said
capitol contract or interest in the profits thereof to record all
such assignments and the agreement thereby affected to that
[as their?] method of giving notice of assignments."
The bill further alleges the performance of the contract
by Taylor, large profits as the result thereof, and prays an
accounting.

MR. JusTicE BnEwE

delivered the opinion of the court.

That which arrests the attention is that, though the defendant furnished all the means and did all the work of building
the capitol, and although the authorities of the State expressly
recognized him as the contractor, bound in all respects to
carry out the contract with the State in the same manner as
the original contractor, and though he had no knowledge of
any claim of plaintiff, the court is asked to recognize the latter
as the owner of one thirty-second of the profits of the con-

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

tract, and to compel the defendant to pay him that amount.
While only one thirty-second of the profits is asked for, the
rule would be the same if thirty one thirty-seconds were sued
for, and the first and principal question which arises is, whether
these transactions between Schnell and A. A. Burck and between A. A. Burck and plaintiff, had without the knowledge
of the defendant, operated to create in the plaintiff a valid
claim to a share of the profits. The contract in its twentysixth clause stipulated that there should be no assignment in
whole or in part by the contractor without the consent in
writing of the state authorities. No such consent was given
to the assignment by Schnell to Burck, nor does it appear that
the State ever in any form recognized the plaintiff, or his
immediate grantor, as having any interest in, or control of,
the contract, or any part thereof. He was to both the State
and the defendant, who did the work, an unknown party until
after the full completion of the contract, when for the first
time he appears claiming an interest in the profits by virtue
of an assignment and transfer, made before the work was
done and in disregard of the terms of the contract.
It is earnestly insisted by counsel that this provision forbidding an assignment without the written consent of the state
authorities was solely for the benefit and protection of the
State; that it did not restrict or interfere with the right of
the contractor to dispose, in any way he saw fit, of an interest
in the contract, or the profits thereof, so long as the party to
whom such transfer was made attempted no interference with
the actual work, and presented no claim against the State.
The contract in the possession of the contractor was his
property, and the profits arising therefrom, and any interest
therein, were as much the subject of disposal as any other
property, and the only limitation was one for the benefit of
the State and could not be claimed by any subsequent assignee
from the contractor. The case of Hobbs v. .Yeoean, 117 U. S.
567, 576, is relied upon as authority for this contention. In
that case one Peck having, in response to an advertisement
from the proper authorities, put in a bid for furnishing wood
and hay to the government, and expecting that the contract

BUR K v. TAYLOR.
Opinion of the Court.

would be awarded to him, entered into a partnership with
McLean and Harmon, by which Peck was to furnish one-half
of the capital necessary to carry on the partnership business,
and McLean and Harmon each one-fourth, the profits and
losses of the partnership to be divided in like proportion.
The partnership was for the purpose of carrying out this
expected contract. Subsequently, the contract with the government was obtained, and after it had been performed and
the money therefor paid to an assignee in bankruptcy of Peck,
the other partners, McLean and Harmon, filed their bill to
recover their proportionate share of the profits, as fixed by
the terms of this partnership. Among the defences was that
the partnership was invalid by reason of section 3737, Revised
Statutes, which reads as follows:
"No contract or order, or any interest therein, shall be
transferred by the party to whom such contract or order is
given to any other party, and any such transfer shall cause
the annulment of the contract or order transferred, so far as
the United States are concerned. All rights of action, however, for any breach of such contract by the contracting parties, are reserved to the United States."
But this defence was overruled, the court, by Mr. Justice
Woods, observing in respect thereto:
"Interpreting the articles in the light of the statute, as it
is the duty of the court to do, they were not intended to transfer, and do not transfer, to the plaintiffs any claim or demand,
legal or equitable, against the United States, or any right to
exact payment from the government by suit or otherwise.
They may be fairly construed to be the personal contract of
Peck, by which, in consideration of money to be advanced
and services to be performed by the plaintiffs, he agreed to
divide with them a fund which he expected to receive from
the United States, on a contract which he had not yet entered
into. This is the plainly expressed meaning of the partnership contract, and it is only by a strained and forced construction that it can be held to effect a transfer of Peck's
contract with the United States, and to be a violation of the
statute.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

"We are of opinion that the partnership contract was not
opposed to the policy of the statute. The sections under consideration were passed for the protection of the government.
Goodman v. Yiblack, 102 U. S. 556. They were passed in
order that the government might not be harassed by multiplying the number of persons with whom it had to deal, and
might always know with whom it was dealing until the contract was completed and a settlement made. Their purpose
was not to dictate to the contractor what he should do with
the money received on his contract after the contract had
been performed."
It is insisted that, tested by the rule thus laid down, this
stipulation of clause 26 was one solely for the benefit of the
State, and worked no restriction on the right of the contractor
to dispose, in advance of the completion of the contract, of the
profits which should enure therefrom.
We cannot concur in these views. By the section quoted
not only was a transfer of the contract prohibited, but also
the result of such a forbidden transfer declared. In terms it
was said that any "such transfer shall cause the annulment of
the contract or order transferred, so far as the United States
are concerned." Expressio unlus est exclusio alterius. The
express declaration that so far as the United States are concerned a transfer shall work an annulment of the contract,
carries, by clear implication, the declaration that it shall have
no such effect as between the contractor and his transferee.
In other words, as to them, the transfer is like any other
transfer of property, and controlled by the same rules. Its
invalidity is only so far as the government is concerned, and it
alone can raise any question of the violation of the statute.
The government in effect, by this section, said to every contractor, You may deal with your contract as you please, and
as you may deal with any other property belonging to you,
but so far as we are concerned you, and you only, will be
recognized either in the execution of the contract or in the
payment of the consideration.
It is familiar law that not every contract in contravention
of the terms of a statute is void, and the courts will search

the language of the statute to see whether it was the intent
of the makers that a contract in contravention of it should
be void or not. Hfarris v. Runnels, 12 How. 79; Afiller v.
Amon, 145 U. S. 421; Pangborm v. Westlake, 36 Iowa,
546.
It was in pursuance of this line of thought that the court, in
H1obbs v. AfoLean, ruled as it did as to the effect of a transfer
by a contractor with the United States of an interest in his
contract to a third party. But it has never been doubted
that, as a general rule, a contract made in contravention of a
statute is void and cannot be enforced, and the only exception
arises when, from an examination of the statute, the courts
are able to discern a different or a limited purpose on the part
of the law makers.
It is true that, in the case at bar, we have no construction
of a statute, but only of the terms of a contract. That contract, however, was as binding on the one party as the other.
The contractor assented to its terms precisely as did the State,
and his promise was not to assign the contract in whole or in
part without the consent in writing of the state authorities.
It was a promise which entered into and became one of the
terms of the contract, and one which was binding, not only
upon the parties, but upon all others who sought to acquire
rights in it. It may be conceded that, primarily, it "was a
provision intended, although not expressed, for the benefit of
the State, and to protect it from interference by other parties
in the performance of the contract, to secure the constant and
sole service of a contractor with whom the State was willing
to deal, and to relieve itself from the annoyance of claims
springing up during or after the completion of the contract in
favor of parties of whose interests in the contract it had no
previous knowledge, and to the acquisition of whose interests
it had not consented. Concede all this, and yet it remains
true that it was a stipulation which was one of the terms of
the contract and binding upon the contractor, and equally
binding upon all who dealt with him. It is unnecessary to
hold that the contractor might not be personally bound upon
his promise made before the performance of the contract to

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

transfer a portion of his profits to any third party. Whatever
liabilities he might assume by such a promise, it would be an
independent promise on his part, and would not let the
promisee into an interest in the contract. It would give him
no right to take part in the work, no right to receiveanything from the State, and all that it would give hin
would be an independent right- of action against the contractor for the failure to pay that which he had promised to pay; the contract remaining all the time theproperty of the contractor, subject to disposal by and with
the consent of the State. To him alone the State would
remain under obligations, and with him alone would the State.
be required to deal. In no way, by garnishment, injunction,
or otherwise, could the promisee prevent the State from
carrying out the entire contract with the contractor, payingto him the whole consideration, and receiving from him a full
release. By the three instruments of January 31, May 9, and
June 20, 1882, this contract was wholly transferred to and
accepted by the defendant. This was while the contract was
executory and before the work was done, and these transfers
were with the written consent and approval of the state authorities, and by them the State in terms recognized "Abner
Taylor as the contractor, bound in all respects to carry out the
contra t with the State of Texas in like manner as the original
contractor, Matthias Schnell, was bound." In other words, by
the consent of parties, and in accordance with the express provisions of the contract, before the work was done Abner Taylor, the defendant, was substituted for Schnell as the contractor.
It was precisely the same as though the contract with Schnell
had been surrendered and a new one made with Taylor. The
contract was still executory; nothing had been earned by
Schnell, and nothing was due to him. He steps out of the
contract and Taylor steps in; Taylor is accepted as the contractor and proceeds with the work. Would it not be strange
if, after having thus completed the contract, some person could,
on the strength of an unknown transfer of the entire profits of
the contract made before the transfer to Taylor, compel the
latter to pay to him such entire profits? And yet if one thirty-

BURCK v. TAYLOR.
Opinion of the Court.

second of the entire profits can be so obtained, all the profits
could, in like manner, have been obtained.
It will be borne in mind that the instrument of date January 31, 1882, by which Schnell transferred to Taylor, Babcock
& Co. a three-fourths interest in the contract, did not operate
to make Schnell a mere beneficiary of profits. He and they
became thereby joint contractors with the State. He was
under the same obligation of performance as they, and for
any failure in respect thereto the State could hold him responsible equally with them. The mere fact that there was a division between themselves as to duties in no manner abridged
the fact that he was a joint contractor with them. They, it
is true, were to furnish the money, but he was to have the
management and superintendence. He was to take his part
in the performance of the contract. Not only that, but, as
seen, he was to be personally responsible to them for any loss
or damage caused or sustained by reason of his neglect or mistakes. So, that if he had gone on jointly with them in the
performance of the contract as provided for, out of the profits
earned in the performance of the contract, they would have
had a right to deduct from the amount coming to him all the
loss and damages which they had sustained by reason of his
neglect and mistakes.
We have thus far rested the non-assignability of this contract, or any interest therein, to plaintiff's grantor upon the
express stipulation of clause 26; but even in the absence of
such a clause, it was not competent for Schnell, by his own
act, and without the consent of the State, the other contracting party, to transfer any interest in this contract. It is a
contract of that nature which is not susceptible of assignment
without the consent of the other party. Arkansas VFalley
Smelting Co. v. Belden .Xining Co., 127 U. S. 379; Delaware
County v. .Diebold Safe & Zock Co., 133 U. S. 4,73, 488. In
the latter case it was said by this court:
"A contract to pay money may doubtless be assigned by
the person to whom the money is payable, if there is nothing
in the terms of the contract which manifests the intention of
the parties to it that it shall not be assignable. But when

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.

rights arising out of contract ure coupled with obligations
to be performed by the contractor, and involve such a relation
of personal confidence that it must have been intended that
the rights should be exercised and the obligations performed
by him alone, the contract, including both his rights and his
obligations, cannot be assigned without the consent of the
other party to the original contract."
So that even if clause 26 had been omitted from the contract, Schnell, the contractor, could never have transferred
an interest in it to the grantor of plaintiff so as to vest in him
a right to take part in the work, or a subsequent right to
recover from the State on the completion of the work. All
that could ever have been acquired by an assignment or transfer by Schnell, without the coisent of the State, was a right
to maintain an independent action against him for whatever
share of the profits he had attempted to transfer. But that
obligation would be personal to Schnell, and was not assumed
by the defendant, or Taylor, Babcock & Co. when they took
an assignment of the entire contract from Schnell. Assuming
to the State the performance of Schnell's contract carried with it
no assumption of Schnell's unauthorized assignments or of his
promises to pay over certain -portions of the profits he would
have received had he performed the contract. In other words,
stepping into the place of Schnell in this contract with the
State, they did not assume his personal liabilities to third
parties. They assumed his obligations to the State, and they
took with those obligations a right to receive the entire consideration promised by the State, and they did not agree to
become liable for all or any independent promises he had made
in reference to the contract.
It is true that in that assignment it was stipulated that the
profits were "to be divided as the interests of the parties
appear under the contract, or to their heirs or assigns." If
Schnell, with Taylor, Babcock & Co., had under that assignment performed the contract with the State and had made
profits thereby, it may be that this plaintiff after giving notice
could have enforced both against Schnell and this defendant
a one-thirty-second of such profits, resting upon this stipulation

BURCK v. TAYLOI.
Opinion of the Court.

for division among the parties or their assigns, but as Schnell
never earned any share in the profits there is nothing upon
which that stipulation can take effect. The profits which
would have resulted if Schnell, with Taylor, Babcock & Co.,
had performed the contract might have been very different
from that which did result from the performance of the contract by Taylor alone. It is a mistake to suppose that the
profits to be derived from the performance of a contract, as
yet unexecuted, are something separable from the performance
- as a coupon is detachable from a b6nd- and can be sent
floating through the channels of commerce as a separate
obligation. The profits are tied up in the contract to such an
extent that the promise in respect to them becomes of value
only when he who makes the promise shall have earned the
profits through the performance of the contract. And when
the contract, being wholly executory, is transferred to a third
party who is accepted by the promisor in lieu of the original
contractor, such third party enters upon the performance of
the contract free from any disposition of the profits made by
the original contract or before the substitution.
We have thus far considered this case on the assumption
that the defendant proceeded with the completion of his contract in ignorance of any transfer to plaintiff, and that such
was the case is, we think, a fair inference from the allegations
of the bill. The pleader has evidently dought to charge constructive notice from the fact of record in the office of the
clerk of the county in which the work was done, but in which
none of the land promised and deeded was situated. It is
not pretended that there was any statute providing for such
record, or making the record notice to subsequent assignees
or purchasers, Rev. Stat. Texas, 1879, art. 4331; Bw,'nam v.
Clandler, 15 Texas, 441; Tiright v. Lancaster, 48 Texas,
250; but it is alleged that the assignments and transfers
under which the defendant claims were recorded in that
office. The argument seems to be that the defendant and his
assignors selected filing and record in that office as a means
of giving notice to other parties of their rights, and that
having made such selection was equivalent to an admission

OCTOBER TERMf, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

,that they would accept a like filing and record as notice to
them; but that argument cannot be sustained. The defendant and his assignors may have desired to give as much publicity as possible to the fact of the transfers to themselves,
,and in seeking to give such publicity may have selected the
filing ind record in one of the principal offices of the county
.as a means thereto, but they did not thereby create a new
law in respect to notice. They never in terms declared, and
-their own acts of filing for record carried, no implied declaration of their willingness to accept a similar record as notice to
themselves. They had a right to rely upon the law of the State,
.as enacted by its legislature, and were not bound by any
constructive notice other than those laws provided. If notice
was essential to charge them, actual notice should have been
given, at least in the absence of a statute providing some
means for constructive notice. Indeed, it is a mere and not
very reasonable inference from the fact that they placed
these instruments on record that their purpose was thereby
to give notice. As well might it be assumed that they simply sought to have preserved for their own use a recorded
- copy of their .assignments rather than rest upon their own
possession of the original papers. It is true in this part
. of the bill there is a statement that "said Abner Taylor then
had notice of the same." This language standing by itself is
open to a construction that actual notice was charged, but
that no such construction should be given to it is evident
from the paragraph immediately following, in which the
pleader alleges that notice was given by filing and record, and
-states the reasons why such filing and record should be ac*cepted as constructive notice. Indeed, we do not understand
from counsel's brief or argument that there is a claim that
there was actual notice given of these transfers.
Finally, it is claimed that the defendant was chargeable
with notice because the assignment which he took from A. A.
Burck, on May 27, 1884, was really nothing but a quitclaim;
that a party taking under a quitclaim deed cannot be a bona
,fde purchaser, but takes with notice of all limitations of his
.grantor';.rights, and in respect thereto several authorities are

BURCK v. TAYLOR.
Opinion of the Court.

cited from the State of Texas and elsewhere as to the rights
of one taking under such a deed.
We do not care to enter into the consideration of this question; for, while the instrument is open to two constructions,
yet, conceding that it in terms only quitclaimed, it took nothing away from Taylor's rights; it was not executed until two
years and over after Schnell had parted with all his interest
in the contract to Taylor, Babcock & Co., and it could not
possibly have the retroactive effect of vesting in the plaintiff
a right as against Taylor, which he did not theretofore have.
All that can be inferred from that instrument is that more
than two years after Schnell had parted with his entire interest in the contract to defendant and his associates, and they
had assumed full responsibility to the State, and nearly two
years after defendant had accepted the sole responsibility of
the contract, and after he had partially performed its obligations, he ascertained in some way the existence of an out-standing claim in favor of A. A. Burck and, rather than
litigate with him the validity of that claim, purchased it. It
was not an admission that A. A. Burck had a valid claim to
the extent of the attempted assignment from Schnell to him,
.and the fact that it was in the mere language of a quit claim
as likely resulted from the unwillingness of A. A. Burck to
assume the obligations of a covenant or warranty as from any.
,other reason.
In conclusion, we hold that by the nature of the contract as
well as its express stipulation Schnell was incapacitated from
transferring an interest therein without the consent of the
State; that the attempted transfers from him to A. A. Burck
and from A. A. Burck to S. B. Burck created simply a personal obligation which could be enforced against him alone;
that the assignments and transfers with the consent of the
State vested the absblute and sole interest in the contract in
the defendant, Abner Taylor; that the latter took without
notice of the plaintiff's claim; and that by his performance of
the contract he acquired the right to the entire consideration
promised by the State, and assumed no liability to Schnell,
.and no obligation to perform any promise which Schnell made

SHiamS, dissenting.
I am unable to concur in the opinion and judgment of the
court in this" case, and will briefly state the grounds of my
dissent.
The case stands upon the bill, original and amended, and
demurrer thereto. From the nature of the building contract
between the State of Texas and Schuell, as well as the covenant
contained in the twenty-sixth clause thereof, providing that
the contract should not be assigned in whole or in part by the
contractor without the consent, in writing, of the designated
state officials, "with the advice and consent of the heads of
departments," the conclusion is reached by the court that
1 Schnell was incapacitated from transferring an interest
therein without the consent of the State; that the admitted
transfers from him to A. A. Burok, and from A. A. Burck to
S. B. Burok, (complainant,) created simply a personal obligation, which could be enforced against him alone; that the
assignments and transfers, with the consent of the State,
vested the absolute and sole interest in the contract in the
defendant, Abner Taylor; that the latter took without notice
of the plaintiff's claim; that by his performance of the contract he acquired the right to the entire consideration promised
by the State, and assumed no liability to Schnell and no obligation to perform any promise which Schnell made to plaintiff
or plaintiff's assignor."
I find nothing in the allegations of the bill or in the exhibits, made a part thereof, which sustains the statement that
Taylor "took without notice of the plaintiff's claim." The
bill certainly does not admit that Taylor took the transfer to
himself and Babcock from A. A. Burck without notice of the
previous transfer to S. B. Burck. The other conclusions involve legal"and equitable propositions, which, as applied to

BURCK v. TAYLOR.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Shiras, JJ.

the admitted facts of this case, are not, in my opinion, correct.
There are important allegations in the bill, and provisions
in some of the contracts, made exhibits thereto and parts
thereofj which are admitted by the demurrer, but which are
not noticed or considered in the opinion. By the contract of
January 31, 1882, (Exhibit "L,") Schnell assigned and set
over to Charles B. Farwell, John V. Farwell, Amos C. Babcock, and Abner Taylor, "an undivided three-fourths interest
in said (state) contract, for the purpose that the said parties
of the second part may share in any and all the profits that
may arise from same, the same as the party of the first part,
(Schnell,) as their interests may appear, which is hereby agreed
to be equal;" that is, the assignees collectively were interested
in the three-fourths interest transferred to them. This contract further provided that the assignees were "to furnish
whatever money may be needed or necessary for the proper
construction of said state-house or for the execution of the
said contract as the same may be required from time to time."
The sum of $13,000, which the parties acknowledged to be
then due Schnell, was to be paid with interest "whenever the
sum of $50,000 shall have been realized by the sale of lands
named in said (state) contract." After the payment of that
sum the contract provides "that the said parties of the second
part are to have all the remaining profits until all the money
advanced as above stipulated shall be paid, with six per cent
interest thereon per annum from the time said money is
advanced, and all the other profits are to be divided as the
interests of the parties appear under the contract or to their
heirs or assigns. It is further agreed by and between the
parties hereto that Amos C. Babcock, one of the parties of the
second part, shall be the trustee for the parties herein named of
each part, to act as and be the trustee to receive the title to
be conveyed in pursuance of the contract between the State
of Texas and the said Matthias Schnell and receipt for same
to the proper officers of said State, and do all other things
required of the said Schnell pertaining to the conveyance of
the lands under said contract with the State of Texas or

capitol building commissioners, and to hold the same and to
make such conveyances or sales of said lands or any portion
thereof from time to time as the parties hereto may direct."
The State of Texas, by its proper officials, gave its written
consent to this contract of assignment, which operated to
substitute Schnell and his assignees, composing a partnership
under the style of Taylor, Babcock & Company, as the contractors with the State in place of the original contractor.
In thus becoming the substituted contractors with the State,
instead of Schnell, the members of the partnership in no way
abrogated or terminated the provisions of their private contract inter sese as above set forth. It admits of no question
that by the terms of this partnership contract Schnell was not
required to make any advances or incur any expenditures in
executing the state contract and completing the capitol building, as the four assignees of an undivided three-fourths interest in the state contract were to advance all the funds required
for that purpose, and obtain their reimbursement from the
sales of the lands to be received from the State in settlement
for the work. It is equally clear that Schnell retained a onefourth share of the profits that might be realized on the contract after refunding advances made by his copartners in
completing the capitol building. Now, the State of Texas
certainly had no concern with these private matters and
agreements between the new contractors. It was not interested in, or in any way affected by, the relative or respective
shares of the contractors in the profits which might be made.
Neither had the State any interest in the question as to how,
or amongst whom, such profits, if any, should be divided.
These were mgtters to be settled among the copartners or
associate contractors, and they were settled by them in the
provision of their private contract which provided that, after
repaying the amount expended in constructing the state capitol, "all the other profits are to be divided as the interests
of the parties appear under the contract, or to their heirs or
assigns." It can hardly be doubted that this language permitted and provided for the assignment by either or all of
the partners of his or their share in the profits, and that such

BURCK v. TAYLOR.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Shiras, JJ.

assignee could equitably assert a right thereto against any
person into whose hands such profits might come, or be found,
except a bonjft(e purchaser thereof for value without notice
of the assignee's rights. Such an assignee of a share in the
profits of the enterprise would have nothing to do with the
execution of the state contract out of which profits might
arise. Nor would he touch the State at any point, or in
any way affect its rights, interest, or convenience. The contractor's covenant not to assign the building contract without
the consent, in writing, of designated state officials, did not
extend to or cover an assignment by the contractor of a share
or interest in the profits which It was expected would arise
from the execution of the contract. The State had notice of
the provisions of the private partnership contract which included "assigns" among those entitled to share in the division
of the profits, and in consenting to the arrangements made by
that contract it may be fairly assumed to have assented to
such provisions. The right to assign a share or interest in the
profits was one of the terms of the copartnership, which the
State accepted as contractor in the place of Schnell. In thus
accepting the firm as contractor, with notice that its members
had provided for their "assigns" to share in the profits of the
building contract, the State itself could not thereafter have
objected to Schnell's assignment of his interest, wholly or
partially, in the profits that the firm might make out of the
contract, whether such assignment was made before the completion of the work, or after.
Suppose the firm of Taylor, Babcock & Company, having
the same copartnership articles and agreements as to how the
members should share in the profits of the business, had been
the original, instead of the substituted, contractors? Could
or would it be held that the contract with the State, or the
twenty-sixth clause thereof, would operate or have the effect
to prevent any member of the firm from assigning a part of
his interest in the profits that might be realized in completing
the state building? Such a proposition as this could not be
maintained. It would be too clear for argument that the
state contract with the partnership could not control the

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Shiras, JJ.

articles of copartnership as between the partners and third
parties in respect to what might be realized by the firm out
of the contract with the State. Each partner of a firm has
an undoubted right to make a valid assignment, either
absolutely or as security, in the profits of a partnership. No
partner owns absolutely any part of the partnership property.
He cannot assign any particular part of such property, or any
specific amount of the profits of the concern. But the assignment of his share, or any part thereof, in such profits will pass
such part of the profits as may remain after payment of the
firm's debts, and settlement of the partnership accounts. The
right conferred by the assignment is an intangible thing and
can only be reduced to possession by a demand for account,
and no notice of such an assignment need be given other than
a demand for an account of such profits. This is the rule laid
down in lallace's Appeal, 104 Penn. St. 559, where it was
held "that a purchaser of a partner's interest, whether at
private or judicial sale, acquires merely the right to demand
an account from the other partners and receive a certain share
of the balance remaining after the payment of the partners'
debts and the adjustment of the partnership equities. This
right is an intangible thing, and can only be reduced to possession by a demand for an account." In that case it was
further held that the assignee of a partners' interest was
superior to the claim of general creditors, and all others claiming under the partnership, except the purchasers for value
without notice.
The right of the partners, under the articles of copartnership, as well as under the general law, to make a transfer or
assignment of their interest in the profits of the firm, should
not be confounded with the right of the firm to make an
assignment of the contract, so far as the State is concerned.
In accepting the copartnership as its contractor the State did
not undertake to control the ordinary rights of partners, nor
abrogate their private agreement. The opinion of the court
asserts the proposition and reaches the conclusion that, notwithstanding the terms of the partnership agreement, which
provided that the "assigns" of any member of the firm should

Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Shiras, JJ.

be included amongst those who were to share in the profits
of the enterprise, as their interest might appear, still such an
assignee could acquire no right or title to the profits as against
the firm, or members thereof, into whose hands such profits
might come, without the consent of the State to such assignmeat; and as the result of this startling proposition, holds
that the appellee, Taylor, who was a member of the firm and
a party to that agreement, is relieved from liability to account
for profits which belong to the appellant, as the assignee of
Schnell. I know of no principle or authority upon which this
can be sustained.
Having retained a one-fourth interest in the profits of the
building contract, Schnell, on January 31, 1882, by written
contract, after reciting the contracts with the State, and with
Taylor, Babcock, and the Farwells, transferred and assigned
to A. A. Burck and two others, separately and severally, an
undivided one-fourth part "of all and whatever share, interest, or advantage, whether in money, lands, or otherwise,
which he (said Schnell) may be entitled to have or receive
under or by virtue of the contracts herein mentioned and
referred to," excepting only the $5000 to be paid for his services as superintendent, and $13,000 coming to him out of the
'first $50,000 proceeds of land sales. This assignment contained the provision "that this contract shall be' binding upon
and inure to the executors, administrators, heirs, and assigns
of the several parties hereto respectively, and that the same
shall be recognized by the parties and trustee named in the contracts herein referred to."
This assignment to A. A. Burck was witnessed by A. 0.
Babcock, of the firm of Taylor, Babcock & Company, and
trustee of the parties to receive and sell the lands to be acquired under the building contract. He not only witnessed
the contract, but appeared before the proper officers and
proved its execution for registration. The firm of Taylor,
Babcock & Company thus had notice through one member
thereof of the assignment. In addition to this it is distinctly
alleged in the amended bill that this transfer was executed
by Schnell "with the knowledge and assent of said partner-

ship," meaning Taylor, Babcock & Company. It is further
alleged "that the said Matthias Schnell, having assigned to
the said A. A. Burck a right to one-sixteenth interest in the
profits that might arise from the construction of said capitol
under said contract with the State of Texas, and having- made
such assignment to said Burck at the time said partnership
was existing, as hereinbefore alleged, with the knowledge and
assent of said firm as it theft existed, the right of the said
A. A. Burck to have one-sixteenth of the profits that might
arise from the carrying out of said contract and to have an
accounting therefor became binding upon said firm and its
assignees."
On May 9, 1882, Schnell by written contract transferred his
remaining interest in the contracts (consisting of his claim of
$13,000, and an undivided one-sixteenth interest or share in
the profits that might be realized) to Charles B. and John V.
Farwell, Abner Taylor, and A. C. Babcock, "who composed
the firm of Taylor, Babcock & Company." In respect to this
assignment, which the State approved, the original petition
charges "that the said Taylor, Babcock & Company received
said assignment from Matthias Schnell of all his interest in
said contract to complete said state capitol with full notice of
the interest of said A. A. Burck, as hereinbefore alleged, an
undivided one-half of which interest A. A. Burck subsequently
transferred to plaintiff, S. B. Burck, as aforesaid, and that the
said Abner Taylor had'full notice of the interest of the said
A. A. Burck at the time of the said transfer of Taylor, Babcock & Company to him, the said Abner Taylor, and with full
notice that by the terms of the agreement and assignment'
executed by and between said Matthias Schnell, of the first
part, and J. M. Beardsley, James S. Drake, and A. A. Burck,
of the second part, that the same should be binding on, and
inure to, the executors, administrators, heirs, or assigns of the
several parties to the said contract."
Now, after this transfer by Schnell of his interest to the firm
of Taylor, Babcock & Company, what was the situation in respect to the profits that might be realized from the building
contract ? It was clearly this: Taylor, Babcock & Company

BURCK v. TAYLOR.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Shiras, JJ.

thereafter held and owned the three-fourths interest acquired
under the partnership contract of January 31, 1882, and onesixteenth interest derived from the assignment of May 9, 1882,
aggregating thirteen-sixteenths interest in the profits, leaving
the outstanding three-sixteenths assigned to A. A. Burek and
others by Schnell on January 31, 1882. The stipulations of
the partnership contract were in no way changed or affected
by Schnell's assignment of his remaining interest to the firm
of Taylor, Babcock & Company. The obligation of Taylor
and his associates, Babcock and the Farwells, to furnish the
money required to complete the contract was not altered or
abrogated in any way. and if the contract had been completed
by Taylor, Babcock & Company, the profits realized from the
sales of the lands, after refunding the expenditures made in
completing the contract, would have been distributable between the parties in the proportion of thirteen-sixteenths to
Taylor, Babcock & Company, one-sixteenth to A. A. Burck,
and two-sixteenths to the other two assignees of Schnell.
On June 20, 1882, the firm of Taylor, Babcock & Company
transferred the building contract to Abner Taylor, which was
assented to by the State, and Taylor thereby became the contractor. But in so doing he did not cease to be bound by the
terms of the partnership contract under which Schnell retained
his one-fourth interest in the profits, and a right to assign it, as
he did. In other words, Taylor, in acquiring the shares of the
members of the firm of Taylor, Babcock & Company, in no
way either terminated or affected the interest of the parties
holding the outstanding interests in the profits assigned by
Schnell to A. A. Burck, with the knowledge and consent of
both Taylor and the firm of Taylor, Babcock & Company.
Nor did the transfer to Taylor by Babcock and the Farwells,
as members of the firm of Taylor, Babcock & Company, in"
any way relieve Taylor from the provisions of the contract of
January 31, 1882, which required himself and associates, other
than Schnell, to furnish all the money needed to complete the
building. The only effect of that transfer was simply to place
Taylor in the shoes of Taylor, Babcock & Company, subjecting
him to all the obligations resting upon himself and assignors,

and affected by all the rights and equities which were binding
upon the firm, not only in respect to the State, but as to all
others interested in the result of the enterprise.
It is held, in the opinion of the court, that this assignment
by the members of the firm of Taylor, Babcock & Company to,
the appellee, Taylor, with the consent of the State, vested in
him the absolute and sole interest in the contract, and profits
arising therefrom, and that by his completion of the contract
he acquired the right to the entire consideration promised by
the State, and assumed no liability to either Schnell or to
others claiming under Schnell. Schnell's assignee, holding the
outstanding one-sixteenth interest in the profits, was no party
to that arrangement. His rights were fixed by the partnership articles, and how and upon what principle can it be maintained that Taylor's acquisition of the interest of Babcock and
the Farwells in the contract, and the profits thence to arise,
can cut off this outstanding interest held by Burck? By taking the assignment from his copartners, Taylor was in no way
released from the obligation to furnish money and complete
the contract which rested upon the firm of Taylor, Babcock &
Company; and how is it then that, by acquiring the interest
of his copartners, he can terminate or extinguish the right of
Schnell's assignee, previously acquired with the knowledge and
consent of the firm of Taylor, Babcock & Company? Can
rights acquired with Taylor's knowledge and consent be cut
off and extinguished by the private dealings between himself
and partners, even though it be with the consent of the State?
No such proposition can be sustained either upon principle or
authority.
By the transfer of April 14, 1883, from A. A. Burck to the
complainant S. B. Burck, (Exhibit "0,") the latter acquired
an undivided one-half interest in the one-sixteenth interest
held by the former, and thereby became entitled to onethirty-secondth part of the profits that might arise upon the
completion of the contract, and the sales of the land to be
received therefor. This transfer left A. A. Burck the holder
of one-thirty-secondth interest in the profits, and, thereafter,
on M£ay 27, 1884, he assigned to Abner Taylor and A. C.

BURCK v. TAYLOR.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Shiras, JJ.

Babcock all his right, interest, and claim in and to the contract with the State of Texas derived from Schnell, or any
interest he might have in the erection of the capitol building.
These two assignments by A. A. Burck are not, upon their
faces, in conflict. They may well stand together. That to
S. B. Burck was of a specific interest; that to Taylor and
Babcock may be fairly construed to cover A. A. Burck's remaining interest of one-thirty-secondth share of the profits.
This last transfer does not purport to convey the one-thirtysecondth interest previously transferred to S. B. Burck, and
there is no allegation in the bill to give color to the idea that
Taylor and Babcock, in taking the assignment of May 27,
1884, from A. A. Burck, supposed that they were getting a
one-sixteenth interest instead of a one-thirty-secondth interest.
When that assignment was made to them, Taylor and Babcock both knew that A. A. Burck had acquired from Schnell
a one-sixteenth interest in the profits, and it is somewhat
significant that they accepted an assignment from him, general in its character, without specification as to the interest
conveyed. It is alleged that this transfer from A. A. Burck
to Taylor and Babcock did not, upon its face, purport to convey the interest previously conveyed to S. B. Burok. Upon
demurrer this statement of the bill with respect to the purport of that transfer must be taken as true. In Campbell v.
.Mackay,1 Myl. & Or. 603, Lord Ohancellor Cottenham laid
down the rule "that the court upon demurrer must assume
the statement of the bill, with respect to the purport of a
deed, to be true, and the demurring party is not at liberty to
read the instrument itself for the purpose of disproving the
statement, notwithstanding that for greater certainty as to
its contents, the bill expressly refers to it as being in the
demurring party's possession."
When this assignment of May 27, 1884, was made to Taylor
and Babcock, the latter had ceased to be a cocontractor for
the erection of the building.
The State never assented to either of these assignments by
A. A. Burck. The want of that assent is held to violate the
transfer to S. B. Burck, while it does not affect that made to

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Shiras, JJ.

Taylor and Babcock. In reference to these A. A. Burck
assignments the bill charges "that for reason why your orator should not have an account or relief against him the
defendant pretends that he had no notice that the said A. A.
Burck assigned or transferred to your orator a one-half interest in his, the said A. A. Burck's one-sixteenth interest in the
profits that might arise from the building of said capitol contract, and, that the defendant in good faith and without
notice purchased from said A. A. Burck for valuable consideration the said Burck's one-sixteenth in said profits after the
said A. A. Burck had sold one-half of his said interest to your
orator, and therefore refuses to account with plaintiff;
whereas the truth is that the said transfer by A. A. Burck to
your orator, which has been hereinbefore stated and made a
part of this bill as an exhibit, was duly authenticated for
registration in the office of the county clerk, and was duly recorded in the records of deeds of Travis County, Texas, on
the 14th day of April, A.D. 1883, and said Abner Taylor then
had notice of the same; whereas the said A. A. Burck did
not sell or transfer any of his said interest in said profits to
said Abner Taylor until the 27th day of May, 1884."
Suppose, as suggested in the opinion of the court, that this
does not amount to anything more than an averment of constructive notice arising from the registration of the transfer?
It was certainly not an admission that Taylor had no notice
of that assignment. But considering the subject-matter of
the interest transferred by Schnell to A. A. Burck, and by
him to S. B. Burck, and the situation of the parties, the question arises whether want of a definite allegation that Taylor
and Babcock had notice of the complainant's interest when
they took their assignment from A. A. Burck, can in any way
affect or defeat the complainant's rights according to the allegations of the bill?
The interest involved was to arise out of the sales of lands
then being, and thereafter to be acquired, without expense to
Schnell or his assignees. To whom was an assignee of an interest in the profits under duty and -obligation to give notice?
The ordinary rule applicable to the transfer of debts or choses

BUROK v. TAYLOR.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Shiras, JJ.

in action has no application to the case, as shown in Wallace's
Ajppeal, 104 Penn. St. 603. The principle which would
govern and control the question and the conflicting rights of
complainant and Taylor and Babcock, if there is any real conflict between them, is the equitable doctrine of a bonafide purchaser for value without notice. This is a matter of defence
on the part of such purchaser. There is certainly nothing on
the face of either the bill or the contracts, made exhibits
thereto, to indicate that Taylor, or Taylor and Babcock, have
or can assert any such defence, and yet the court's opinion
and conclusion gives Taylor the full benefit of that position as
effectually as though he had set it up by answer and established it by proof.
There is a clear distinction between choses in action and
chattel or freehold .interests. This distinction is pointed out
in Wiltshire v. Rabbits, 14 Sim. 76, 77, in which it was held
that the person who took the first assignment of an annuity
charged on leaseholds was entitled to priority over the person
who took the second, notwithstanding the latter may have
been beforehand with the former in giving the trustee notice
of his security. The same general principle is asserted in
.MleC'eightv. Foster, 5 Oh. App. 604, 610. And in
hilaot v.
Pike, 5 Hare, 14, it was distinctly held that the doctrine of
notice applicable in determining the priority of charges on
choses in action does not prevail as to equitable estates in
land. In that case several mortgages were held to take effect
with regard to interests arising out of real estate, according to
the order of time at which they were respectively created, and
that their priorities were not affected by the giving or failing
to give notice to the party in whom the legal estate was vested.
But even treating the interest here involved as an ordinary
chose in action, no proposition is better settled than that an
assignee of such a right can take only such interest as his
assignor has to transfer, and will be bound by all equities binding on the latter, unless it affirmatively appears that the subsequent assignee took without notice. Davies v. Austen, 1
Ves. Jr. 247; Biashear v. West, 7 Pet. 608; Livingston v.
iulbbs, 2 Johns. Ch. 312; Xectinnie v. Rutheiford, 1 Dev. &

There is no allegation in the bill which can be tortured into
an admission that Taylor occupies the position of a bonafide
purchaser, for value without notice, of the interest of A. A.
Burck previously conveyed to S. B. Burck. The opinion of
the court goes far beyond giving Taylor the benefit of such
position. It, in principle and effect, gives to the covenant
agaiist transferring the state contract a greater effect than a
law or a statute could have had. How can the rule laid down
by the court that the covenant against transferring the state
contract has the effect to defeat the rights of an assignee from
a member of the firm of contractors be reconciled with the
principle announced in Blair v. Gibbes, 17 How. 232, 239;
Brooks v. Martin, 2 Wall. 70, 87; Railroad Co. v. Dutrant,
95 U. S. 576, and also in Sharp v. Taylor, 2 Phillips, 801,
818? In these cases it was held that there was a distinction
between enforcing an illegal or prohibited contract, and the
assertion of a title to funds that had been realized out of such
transactions. Here the contract with the State has been completed. The State is not objecting to the assignment made by
Schnell to A. A. Burck, and by A. A. Burck to S. B. Burck,
and certainly Taylor, who not only had knowledge of Schnell's
assignment to A. A. Burck, but is charged with having assented thereto, is not in a position to interpose an objection
which even the State could not urge in order to withhold
funds that do not belong to him. What Lord Chancellor
Cottenhain said in Sharp v. Taylor, supra, is directly in point
here: "As between these two, can this supposed evasion of
the law be set up as a defence by one against the otherwise
clear title of the other? In this particular suit can the one
tenant in common dispute the title common to both? Can
one of two partners possess himself of the property of the firm,
and be permitted to retain it, if he can show that, in realizing
it, some provision in some act of Parliament has been violated
or neglected? Can one of two partners in any import trade
defeat the other by showing that there was some irregularity
in passing the goods through the custom-house? The answer

BURCK v. TAYLOR.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Shiras, JJ.

to this, as to the former case, will be that the transaction
alleged to be illegal is completed and closed, and will not be
in any manner affected by what the court is asked to do, as
between the parties. Do the authorities negative this view of
the case? The difference between enforcing illegal contracts
and asserting title to money which has arisen from them is distinctly taken in Tenant v. Elliot, 1 Bos. & Pull. 3; and Faner
v. I ssell, 1 Bos. & Pull. 296, and recognized and approved
by Sir William Grant in Thomson v. Thomson, 7 Ves. 473."
The same principle is laid down in the recent case of Kingsb~ley v. Barrill et al., 151 Mass. 199, where it was held that
an assignment of a fractional part of a claim is good in equity
where the person who is to pay raises no objection, following
James v. vewton , 142 Mass. 366.
The present case cannot be distinguished in principle from
the rule announced in Hobs v. MXeean, 117 U. S. 567, in
which A, having contracted with the United States to furnish
supplies of wood and hay to troops in Montana, entered into
partnership with B and 0 for the purpose of executing the
contract. A was to furnish half the capital, B and C onefourth each, and profits and losses were to be divided on that
basis; but, in fact, the capital was furnished by B and C. A
delivered the wood according to the contract, but failed to
deliver the hay, and, payment being refused, he brought suit
in his own name in the Court of Claims against the United
States to recover the contract price of the wood. In this suit
B and C each was a witness on behalf of A, and each testified
that he had no "interest, direct or indirect, in the claim,"
except as a creditor of A, holding his note. Pending the suit,
A became bankrupt, and then died. His administratrix was
admitted to prosecute the suit, but before entry of final judgment his assignee in bankruptcy was substituted in her place.
Final judgment was then rendered in favor of the assignee,
and the amount of the judgment was paid him. B and C, as
surviving partners, then filed a bill in equity against the
assignee and the attorneys and counsel, to recover their shares
in the partnership property, and the court sustained their right
to recover.

OCTOBER TERI, 1893.
Dissenting Opinion: Jackson, Shiras, JJ.

The attempt to draw distinctions between decisions which
involve no substantial differences in principle is not only
unwise, but is attended inevitably with embarrassment in the
administration of the law. The cases of Arkansas Valley
Smelting Co. v. Belden Xining Co., 127 U. S. 379, and
Delaware County v. Diebold Safe and Lock Co., 133 U. S.
488, cited in the opinion of the court, fall far short of asserting the proposition that a member of the firm of Taylor,
Babcock & Company (the substituted contractors with the
State) could not transfer an interest in the profits to arise out
of the building contract without the consent of the State.
There is a class of cases where the services to be rendered are
of such a personal character that they cannot be assigned;
but where is the authority that holds that where a firm is a
contractor to do certain work a member of such firm cannot
assign or transfer his share of the profits to arise therefrom?
I have looked in vain for such an authority.
The real question before the court upon the bill, and the
demurrer thereto, is not whether Schnell could have assigned
to A. A. Burck the right to take part in or assert any control
over the construction of the state capitol, or to have recovered
from the State the compensation it had promised to pay therefor? But the question is, can Taylor retain a share of the
profits which belong to Schnell by the partnership agreement,
made with himself and his associates upon full consideration,
a portion of which profits Schnell, "with his knowledge and
consent," transferred to A. A. Burck, who assigned a part
thereof to the complainant? Under and by what provision
of the contract, described in the record, did Taylor become
entitled to hold that share for his own benefit?
The bill shows that the building cost about $3,700,000; that
the lands received from the State as compensation for the
work, and since sold, were worth from ten to eleven millions
of dollars, and the profits made on the transaction were between
seven and eight millions of dollars. By the terms of the partnership contract, all the expenditures connected with the completion of the building were to be refunded with interest, and the
remaining profits were to be divided "as the interest of the

parties or their assigns might appear." The complainant as
an "assign" holds title to one-thirty-secondth interest of those
profits. The bill clearly discloses his right thereto, and I fail
to see upon what principle Taylor can dispute his claim or
deny the account which he seeks. To allow him to do so,
under the allegations in this bill, and upon the ground on
which it is rested, that the State did not assent to the complainant's acquisition of the interest he holds, is not only a
perversion of right and justice, but finds no sanction or support
in either principle or authority.
