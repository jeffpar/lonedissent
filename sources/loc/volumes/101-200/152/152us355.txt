ISRAEL v. ARTHUR.
Statement of the Case.

these could not be adjudicated in the absence of Harper as a
party, and we therefore think the court below did not err in
sustaining the demurrer for that reason.
Upon the whole, we are of opinion that the decree of the
court below, in sustaining the demurrer, and in dismissing the
bill, should be

ISRAEL v. ARTHUR.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF COLORADO.
No. 903.

Submitted January 29, 1894.-Decided Muarch 12,1894.

This court has no jurisdiction to revise the decision of the highest court of
a State, in an action at law, upon a pure question of fact, although a
Federal question might arise if the question of fact were decided in a
particular way.
The decision by the highest court of a State that a woman divorced from
her husband in a proceeding instituted by him and by a decree which
does not bind her, who marries another husband, and lives with him as
his wife, is thereby estopped, after the death of the first husband, from
setting up a claim to a widow's share in the distribution of his estate,
presents no Federal question for revision by this court.

MOTION to dismiss. Abbie A. Israel, under the name of Abbie
A. Arthur, filed her petition in the county court of Laramie
County, Colorado, in the matter of the estate of John Arthur,
deceased, May 17, 1881, alleging that John Arthur died intestate and without children; that she was his widow; that
James B. Arthur had been appointed administrator and was
in possession of decedent's property, and committing breaches
of his duty as such; that he, as a brother of John Arthur, and
certain other brothers and sisters, and descendants of a deceased sister, claimed to be entitled to the estate as heirs at
law; and that the relationship of petitioner to the decedent
and her rights in his estate were ignored; and she prayed that
she might be declared the sole distributee of said estate, and
heir at law of John Arthur, deceased, and that the administrator be required to account accordingly. The defendant an-

swered, denying any misappropriation of the estate, and that
the petitioner was then or ever had been the widow of John
Arthur; and for a second defence, defendant, admitting the
intermarriage of petitioner with John Arthur, alleged that on
February 9, 1875, a decree was duly entered by the county
court of Laramie County in favor of John Arthur and against
petitioner, dissolving the bonds of matrimony theretofore existing between them; and for a further defence alleged that on
June 12, 1877, a second decree of divorce was duly made and
entered in said court in favor of John Arthur and against petitioner. Replication was filed July 21,1881, denying the new
matter in the answer. On Mvarch 30, 1884, petitioner filed
her amended and supplemental petition to her original petition,
wherefrom it appeared that the judgment of the county court
on the trial of the issues made as above stated was against
petitioner, but that that judgment was reversed by the Supreme
Court of Colorado, as were also the decrees of divorce of 1875
and 1877, both of which were held to be null and void and of
no effect for want of jurisdiction. ]sraelv. A'rthur,7 Colorado,

The amended and supplemental petition detailed alleged
misfeasances aid wastes of the administrator and reiterated
petitioner's claim to the proceeds of the estate as the widow
of John Arthur, and prayed relief. The amended and supplemental answer of the defendant, filed April 9, 1884, admitted
that the decrees of divorce were voidable at the option of petitioner for want of due and legal service upon her, but averred
that after the decrees were rendered, petitioner, with full
knowledge thereof, "ratified, affirmed, assented to, and acquiesced in the same and each of them in this, to wit, in that after
the same had been rendered and in the lifetime of the said John
Arthur, the said defendaut,by force and virtue of the said decrees
and under and in pursuance thereof, entered voluntarily into a
contract of marriage with one James H. Israel and caused and
procured the said contract of marriage to be duly and legally
solemnized, and thereunder took upon herself and assumed
the relations of wife to the said James H. Israel, and thenceforward and at all times thereafter continuously, by virtue of

ISRAEL v. ARTHUR.
Statement of the Case.

the said solemnization of said marriage contract, lived and cohabited with the said James H. Israel as his wife until and
ever since the death of the said John Arthur."
The answer also set forth the particulars of the elopement
of petitioner with and marriage to Israel, and grounds why
it had been impossible for the administrator to learn the
facts in time to plead them to the original petition.
In a further answer, filed the same day, the charges of
waste and misfeasance were denied. To this answer a demurrer was interposed April 28, 1884. A further supplemental
answer was filed August 28, 1884, setting up that the administrator had in all things faithfully discharged the duties of his
trust and administered the estate and was ready to make his
final accounting whenever required by order of court. To this
answer a replication was filed by petitioner September 23, 1884.
The record proper does not show the action either of
the county court or of the Supreme Court on these pleadings, but in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Colorado
in this case it appears that judgment was rendered in
favor of the petitioner and the cause again taken to the
Supreme Court, which held that the facts set up in the
amended answer were sufficient to debar or estop petitioner
from claiming any property rights as the widow of John
Arthur, deceased.
Upon the cause being again remanded to the county court
the petitioner filed a new replication, January 27, 1891, to
the amended and supplemental answer of the administrator,
averring the alleged decrees of divorce to be absolute nullities, and that the Supreme Court of the State had so declared, and that the administrator was thereby estopped
from saying that she was not the widow of John Arthur
when he died; and the replication proceeded as follows:
"And this petitioner avers that she is a citizen of the United
States and a citizen of the State of Colorado, and, as widow
of said John Arthur, deceased, as aforesaid, she became at
his death the sole heir of his said estate, consisting of certain
lands, tenements, and hereditaments and personal property
at the said county of Laramie, and as such heir-at-law of him,

Statement of the Case.

the said John Arthur, the said lands, tenements, and hereditaments immediately vested in her and she is now and ever
since has been seized of the same and entitled to the possession, use, and enjoyment of the same; that the personal
estate of him, the said John Arthur, was and is more than
sufficient to pay all the debts of him, the said John Arthur,
and that she, the said petitioner, as such sole heir, is the
sole distributee of the said personal estate after the payment
of said debts and the cost of administration, and the same
and the right thereto became thereupon vested in her and
thence hitherto has been vested in her as an indefeasible
right guaranteed to her by the laws and constitution of the
State of Colorado and by the Constitution of the United
States, and that she has never been summoned or impleaded
in any court or action in which any of her said rights or
property have been adjudged lost, forfeited, or taken from
her by any due process of law; that the Supreme Court of
this State in its judgments heretofore rendered has declared
and adjudged that this petitioner was the widow of the said
John Arthur at the time of his decease, and that such decisions constitute the law of this case, and that by virtue of
the laws of the State of Colorado she is, as such widow, the
sole heir of him, the said John Arthur; that a judgment of
this court dismissing her said petition and giving her said
property to others would, if affirmed by the Supreme Court
of this State, be the taking of her private property without due
process of law, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; that a judgment of this court dismissing her said petition for the
commission of supposed crimes averred in said supplemental
answer to have been committed by her would, if affirmed by
the Supreme Court of this State, constitute an ex post facto
law of the State of Colorado, in contravention of section ten,
article one, of the Constitution of the United States; that a
judgment of this court dismissing her said petition for the
supposed crimes alleged in said supplemental answer to have
been committed by her would, if affirmed by the Supreme
Court of this State, constitute a law of attainder of the State

of Colorado, in contravention of section ten, article one, of
the Constitution of the United States; that a judgment of
this court dismissing her said petition and transferring her
said property to others would, if affirmed by the Supreme
Court of this State, constitute an act of judicial legislation
without the sanction of law and against the rights of this
petitioner guaranteed to her by both the constitution of this
State and the Constitution of the United States.
"And this petitioner denies that after the said pretended
decrees of divorce were rendered, she with full or any knowledge that they had been rendered, or otherwise or at all, ratified or affirmed or assented to or acquiesced in the same or
either of them; denies that there were any decrees to ratify,
affirm, assent to, or acquiesce in, and avers that the pretended
judgments and decrees of divorce mentioned in said amended
and supplemental answer were nil and could not be ratified
or affirmed or assented to or acquiesced in by her.
"Denies that said pretended judgments or decrees of divorce
had or were of any force or virtue; denies that in the lifetime
of the said John Arthur, by force and virtue of said pretended
decrees or under or in pursuance therdof or otherwise, she
entered voluntarily or otherwise into a contract of marriage
with one James H. Israel; denies that she caused or procured
any contract of marriage to be duly or legally or at all
solemnized between herself and the said James H. Israel in
the lifetime of the said John Arthur; denies that any contract of marriage could hive been duly and legally solemnized
between her and the said James H. Israel in the lifetime of
her late husband, the said John Arthur, deceased; and this
said petitioner denies that in the lifetime of said John Arthur,
upon the supposed knowledge that the said pretended decrees
of divorce had been rendered coming to the said petitioner
and the said James H. Israel, she desired to use the said supposed privilege conferred by said pretended decrees or to
accept the supposed benefit thereof, and denies that she procured a marriage to be solemnized between her and the said
James H. Israel in the lifetime of her late husband, John
Arthur, deceased, and she avers that said pretended decrees of

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Statement of the Case.

divorce conferred no privilege she could use and provided no
benefits whatever which she could have accepted."
She further denied that she and Israel went away from the
place where they were living to some place unknown or
remote therefrom, or were married secretly in due form of
law in the lifetime of John Arthur, or that she had ever
admitted or confessed that she had been duly or at all married
to Israel after the rendition of the pretended decrees and in
the lifetime of Arthur, as averred in the answer.
On June 8, 1891, the case came on for trial in the county
court, and the following appears in the bill of exceptions:
"Thereupon on behalf of the petitioner it was stipulated
and admitted by the respondent that the decrees set up in the
respondent's amended and supplemental answer were rendered as therein alleged, and that the same are and were void
when rendered, and that the only question now being tried is
as to whether the plaintiff is estopped by her conduct as
alleged in said answer to dispute or contest the validity of
said decrees or whether she has ratified them by her conduct."
The testimony introduced on both sides is then set forth.
The county court foifnd in favor of defendant, and gave judgment, June 23, 1891, with costs, "that the petitioner, Abbie A.
Israel, of right ought to be and is estopped to aver or claim
that she is the widow or heir of the said John Arthur, deceased, or the distributee of his estate. Wherefore it is considered, adjudged, and decreed by the court that the petition
of the said petitioner be and the same is hereby denied and
dismissed." The cause was taken by writ of error to the
*Supreme Court of Colorado, and on June 11, 1893, that court
rendered its judgment, affirming the judgment of the county
court. The court reviewed the evidence, and held that the
proof was sufficient to warrant the trial court in finding that
plaintiff in error had actually contracted and consummated
the marriage between herself and the second husband before
the death of the first, and that the substance of the issue
formed upon the amended complaint was proved; and the
ruling in Arthur v. Israel, 15 Colorado, 147, that the amended
answer was sufficient in law to debar or estop petitioner

from claiming any property rights as the widow of John
Arthur, deceased, was reaffirmed. Israel v. Arthur, 18 Colorado, 158. A petition for rehearing was filed and overruled,
and thereupon a writ of error was allowed to this court, which
defendant in error moved to dismiss.

after stating the facts, delivered

the opinion of the court.
It is not sufficient for the maintenance of our jurisdiction
to review the judgments of state courts, that a right, title,
privilege, or immunity under the Constitution of the United
States may have been claimed, but such right, title, privilege,
or immunity must have been denied. Assuming that plaintiff
in error, by her replication of January 27, 1891, duly set up a
right of protection under the Constitution, yet if she were
debarred from asserting property rights in the estate of John
Arthur, as his widow, then that right was not denied for want
of the subject-matter to be protected.
The Supreme Court of Colorado ruled in Arthur v. Israel,
15 Colorado, 147, that public policy required "that, so far as
may be consistent with fundamental principles of law, one
who has attempted to profit by a supposed divorce, and has
exercised the resulting privilege of remarriage, shall not, for
the mere purpose of obtaining property, be permitted to
repudiate his election;" and that "when, therefore, the wife,
without cause, deserts her husband and home, and for years
lives in adultery with another man, and afterwards, upon
learning that a divorce has been obtained by her deserted
husband, causes a marriage ceremony with her paramour to
be solemnized, and continuously lives and cohabits with him
as his wife, she may not, upon the subsequent decease of her
abandoned husband, take advantage of the fact that the
divorce decree is void for want of proper service of process,
and successfully assert against other heirs her right under the

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Opinion of the Court.

statute of descents and distribution to deceased's estate as his:
widow." And on the subsequent writ of error it sustained the
judgment of the county court against plaintiff in error upon
the facts.
With the conclusion on the facts we have nothing to do,
and the conclusions of law were conclusions in matters of local
and general law which suggest no Federal question.
By stipulation of record plaintiff in error admitted at thetrial that, the invalidity of the divorce decrees being conceded,
the only question to be tried was whether she was "estopped
by her conduct as alleged in said answer to dispute or contest
the validity of said decrees, or whether she has ratified them
by her conduct."
That question was determined against her, and the judgment
rested solely on the ground that she could not under the facts
be allowed, as to John Arthur's personal estate, to assert the
property rights conferred by law upon a widow. To review
that judgment would be to overhaul the application by a
state court of principles of public policy and of estoppel, which
it is not within our province to do. This was so held in
larrow v. Brinkley, 129 U. S. 178, and in effect in many
other cases. Adams County v. Burlington & .MlissouriRailroad, 112 U. S. 123; Chouteau v. Gibson, 111 U. S. 200;
Beauyrc v. Noyes, 138 U. S. 397.
In Eustis v. Bolles, 150 U. S. 361, it was ruled that a decision by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that a
creditor of an insolvent debtor who proved his debt in insolvency proceedings under the state statutes and accepted the
benefits thereof, thereby waived any right he might otherwise have had to object to the validity of the insolvency
statutes as impairing the obligation of contracts, presented no
Federal question for review. And it has been often held, at
least in actions at law, that this court has no jurisdiction to
revise the decision of the highest court of a State upon a pure
question of fact, although a Federal question might arise if
the question of fact were decided in a particular way. Dower
v. Richards, i51 U. S. 658, and cases cited.
Wfrit of error dismissed.
