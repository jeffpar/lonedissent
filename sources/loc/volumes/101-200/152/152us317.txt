KEOKUK RAILROAD

'v.

SCOTLAND COUNTY.

317

Opinion of the Court.

that a suit for taxes for one year is not an estoppel to a suit
for taxes for a different year, there is the same absence
of that privity of estate so indispensable to an effective
estoppel, which we hold to be fatal in respect to the judgment in the state court. If the plaintiff herein, the Keokuk
and Western Railroad Company, would not have been
affected by an adverse decree in the Secor suit, it cannot
take advantage of the same by way of estoppel. The opera"tion of an estoppel must be mutual.
There was no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Missouri, and it is therefore

_Afimed.

delivered the opinion of the court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1893.
Statement of the Case.

This case differs from the one just decided, ante, 301, only in
the fact that this is a bill in equity, filed by the corporation
whose property is sought to be taxed, to restrain the defendants
from levying or collecting any taxes for the years 1883 to
1887, inclusive, upon the ground that the Circuit Court for
the Eastern District of Missouri in the Secor case, and also
the Supreme Court of the State, had held the property of the
company not to be subject to taxation.
As the questions involved in the two cases are precisely the
same, the decree of the court below dismissing the bill was
correct, and the same is, therefore,
AfimeZ.
MIR. JUSTICE HARLAiN and MR. JUSTICE BREwER dissented.

KEOKUK AND WESTERN RAILROAD COMPANY v.
SCOTLAND COUNTY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF TIE

UNITED STATES

FOR

THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.
No. 414. Argued December 21, 22, 1893.-Decided March 12,1894.

A railroad company which derives its title to its road from a foreclosure of
a mortgage, given before the commencement of a suit by stockholders
to enjoin the collection of taxes upon the property so sold and conveyed,
does not occupy a relation to the plaintiffs in that suit, which entitles it
to file a bill of revivor, or to invoke the decree in the suit as an estoppel.
The purchaser under a mortgage is not entitled to the benefit of an estoppel
under a decree obtained in a suit begun after the execution of the mortgage.

THIs was a bill in equity filed by the Keokuk and Western
Railroad Company to revive a suit begun August 6, 1879, by
Charles A. Secor and other stockholders of the Missouri, Iowa
and Nebraska Railway Company against the judges of the
county courts of Scotland, Schuyler, and Clarke Counties, the
object of which suit was to enjoin the collection of taxes
