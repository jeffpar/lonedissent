THE CITY OF NEW YORK.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NqEW YORK.
No. 61. :rgued November 30, December 1, 1892.- Decided January 3,1893.
In construing the act of February 16,1875, 18 Stat. 315, c. 77, so far as it
,relates to admiralty suits, it is settled:
(1) That the facts found by the court below are conclusive; that a bill
of exceptions cannot be used to bring up the evidence for a review
of the findings; that the only rulings upon which this court is
authorized to pass are such as might be presented by a bill of
exceptions prepared as in an action at law; and that the findings
have practically the same effect as the special verdict of a jury;
(2) That it is only the ultimate facts which the court is bound to find;
and that tlis court will not take notice of a refusal to find the
mere incidental facts, which only amount to evidence from which
the ultimate fact is to be obtained;
(3) That if the court below neglects or refuses to make a finding one
way or the other, as to the existence of a material fact which has
been established by uncontradicted evidence, or if it finds such a
fact when not supported by any evidence whatever, and an exception be taken, the question may be brought up for review in that
particular.
Applying these rules to the findings in the present case, H~eld
(1) That there was gross negligence on the part of the steamship in
failing to run at moderate speed in a fog, and in failing to take
the proper precautions when the proximity of the sailing vessel
became known;
(2) That so far as the barque was concerned there was evidence to
support the findings of the Circuit Court, and that these findings
justify the conclusion that its change of course was made in
extremis.
The probability that a steamer or a vessel sailing with a free wind will
pursue the course customarily pursued in that vicinity by vessels bound
from and to the same port, is-so strong, that a deviation from that course
without apparent cause will not be considered as established without a
'clear preponderance of testimony.
The docket title to this case is: John E. Alexandre, J. Joseph Alexandre, and J. Henry Alexandre, executors of Francis Alexandre, deceased,
et al., claimants of the American steamship City of New York, her
engines, etc., Appellants v. John Machan, et al., owners of the British
.barque Helen, etc.

Statement of the Case.
There is no such certainty of the exact position of a horn blown in a fog,
as will justify a steamer in speculating upon the probability of avoiding
it by a change of helm, without taking the additional precaution of
stopping until its location is definitely ascertained.
Where fault on the part of one vessel is established by uncontradicted testimony, and such fault is, of itself, sufficient to account for the disaster,
it is not enough for such vessel to raise a doubt with regard to the man
agement of the other vessel.

THis was alibel by the owners of the British barque Helen
against the American steamship City of New York for a collision, which occurred on the evening of June 28, 1879, off the
New Jersey coast between Barnegat and Absecon, and resulted in the sinking of the Helen, and the total loss of the
vessel and cargo. The District Court found both vessels to
have been in fault, and decreed an apportionment of damages.
15 Fed. Rep. 624. Both parties appealed to the Circuit Court,
by which the decree of the District Court was reversed, the
City of New York found to have been solely in fault, and a
final decree entered for the libellants for $60,223.12, including
costs. 35 Fed. Rep. 604. From this decree the owners of
the steamship appealed to this court. The following facts and
conclusions of law were found by the Circuit Court:
"1. The British barque Helen, an iron vessel of 282 tons
register, while on a voyage from Havana to New York City,
loaded with sugar, was sunk by collision with, the steamship
City of New York, 'June 28, 1879, about 10.50 :P.m. The
captain and three; of the seamen of the barque were drowned
when the vessel sank.
"2. The collision took place at a point off the coast of New
Jersey six and one-quarter miles from shore, in 10 fathoms of
water, 12 and J miles from Barnegat light-house and 91 miles
from Tucker's Beach light-house.

from the south-west or the south-south-west.

About half an

hour preceding the collision the night became foggy; so much
3o that vessels could not discover one another at a distance of
one-eighth of a mile. During this time and until within about
three or four minutes before the collision the vessels had been
approaching each other, the course of the steamer being about
S. by W. J- W. and the course of the barque being about N.E.
The steamship was going about 11 knots an hour, which was
all the speed she could make against the wind. The barque
was going about 4 knots an hour, and each vessel kept her
respective course until she heard the fog signal of the other.
"4. During the half hour preceding the collision three seamen were on the deck of, the barque besides the mate, one
seaman being at the wheel and two on the lookout forward,
alternately blowing the fog horn, and the barque's lights were
properly set and burning. During the same time the navigation of the steamer was in charge of her second mate, her
quarter-master was at the wheel, her engine was in charge of
a competent engineer, she had a lookout on the forward deck,
and her regulation lights were properly set and burning. The
lookout on each vessel was vigilant. Each vessel observed the
proper fog signals. The steamer maintained her full speed
against the wind until her engines were reversed, just before
she struck the barque.
."5. Before either vessel discovered the other those in
charge of each heard the fog signals of the other. At about
two minutes prior to the collision those in charge of the
steamer first -heard the fog horn of the barque, and from the
-apparent direction of the sound thought she was one point off
the steamer's starboard bow. Immediately upon hearing the
fog horn the mate ordered- the wheel of the steamer . put to

executed and the steamer proceeded on under full speed until
those in charge discovered the sails of the barque. The
-'steamer had run under hard-a-starboard helm at least a
minute before the barque was seen. Those in charge of the
steamer then discovered that the barque's course was eastward,
across the steamer's bow. The steamer then sounded succes.

sive whistles of alarm, and those in -charge saw the barque
luffing to the starboard. Thereupon the mate immediately
ordered the steamer's engines, reversed and her wheel ported,
and this order was promptly executed, but she was then close
to the barque, probably not to exceed 150 feet, and her headway could not be stopped in time to avoid a collision, and the
steamer struck the barque on the barque's port side, her stem
striking just forward of the barque's mizzen rigging, with such
force that she penetrated the barque a distance of five feet,
and the barque sank almost instantly.
"The whistle of the steamer first heard by those in charge
of the barque indicated to them that the vessels were quite
near to each other. They thought the steamer was approaching, bearing abeam on the barque's port side. Immediately
after they saw her masthead light and then her green light,
whereupon the mate told the wheelsman to port the wheel,
and called to those below to save themselves. The man at
the wheel had hardly got the wheel over when the steamer
struck the barque. During the time the steamer was running
under her hard-a-starboard wheel she changed her course to
the eastward three or four points, and the barque after she
luffed changed her course one or two points by the time the
vessels came together."
The sixth finding relates only to the.damages, and is immaterial.
"Conclusions of Law.
"1. The steamer was guilty of fault in violating the 21st
rule, because she did not slacken her speed when she heard
the fog signals of the barque, and also because she did not
go at a moderate speed when in a fog, and also because she
changed her course and kept on at great speed after she heard
the barque's fog horn before seeing her.
"2. The barque's change of course was an error in extremis."

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BRoww delivered the opinion of the court.

Notwithstanding the ruling of this court in The.Abbotsford,
98 U. S. 440, that the finding of facts by the Circuit Court is
conclusive, and that the only rulings that can be reviewed by
this court are"those made upon questions of law, but few collision cases have been brought to this court since the act of
February 16, 1875, 18 Stat. 315, c. 77, took effect, in which
an effort has not been made, under one guise or another, to
obtain a review of the findings of the Circuit Judge upon the
testimony.-, If it were the dutyr of the court to review the
testimony upon every finding of fact to which the defeated
party- chose to take an exception, and inquire whether such
testimony authorized the' finding, the title of the act "To
facilitate the disposition of cases," was a misnomer, and the
act itself might better never have, been passed. In this case
- sixteen- exceptions were taken to the findings of the court;
twenty-one specifications of error are embodied in the seven.teenth exception to the'opinion of the court, which was incor-porated in the bill.of exceptions, and there are also thirty-five
exceptions to the refusal of th6 court to find the facts and law
as requested'by the claimants.
In construing the act of 1875 the following propositions
may be regarded as settled:
1. That the facts found by the court below are conclusive;
that the bill of exceptions cannot be used to bring up the
evidence for a review of these findings; that the only rulings,
-upon which we'are authorized to pass; are such las might be
:presented by a bill of exceptions prepared- as in actions at
law; and that the findings have practically the same effect
as the special verdict of a jury. The Abbotsford, 98 U. S. 440;

3. If the court below neglects or refuses to make a finding,.
one way or the other, as to the existence of a material fact,
which has been established by uncontradicted evidence, or if
it finds such a fact when not supported by any evidence whatever, and afl exception be taken, the question may be brought
up for review in that particular. In the one case the refusal
to find would be equivalent to finding tbt the fact was immaterial; and, in the other, that there was some evidence to
prove what is fouid, when in truth there was none. Both of
these are questions of law, and proper subjects for review in
an appellate court. The Francis Wright, 105 U. S. 381, 387;
The E. A. Packer, 140 U. S. 360.
In the case of The Francis Wright the court held that the
bill of exceptions ought to show the grounds relied on to
sustain the objections, so that it might appear that the court
below was properly informed as to the point to be decided,
and that the facts sought to be incorporated were conclusively
proven by uncontradicted evidence; and if the exception were
as to facts found, it should be stated that it was because there
was no evidence to support them, and then so much of the
testimony as was necessary to establish this ground of complaint, which might under some circumstances include the
whole, should be incorporated in the bill of exceptions. In
The E. A. Packer, 140 U. S. 360, the Circuit Court refused to
find a specific fact which this court thought to be material,
and to have been proven by uncontradicted testimony, and
the case was remanded for a further finding
Z.in regard to this
point.
This case, then, must- turn upon the question whether the
Circuit Court found any facts which were whollyiunsuippoited
by testimony, or refused to find any fact mtei"iatVQ"the su,.
when such fact was proven by uncontiadlidte&dence

a northerly and easterly course, and was sailing free under a
strong southerly wind. The steamship was bound from New
York to Havana upon a course S. by W. -1 W., and was proceeding at her usual full speed, which was from ten to eleven
knots an hour. Each was making the fog signals required by
law, which were heard upon each vessel before the other vessel
camne in sight. About two minutes prior to the collision the
officers. in charge of the steamer first heard the fog horn of
the barque, and, from the apparent direction of the sound,
thought she was one point off the steamer's starboard bow.
Immediately upon hearing the fog horn the mate ordered the
wheel of the steamer to sthrboard and hard-a-starboard.. The
-order was promptly executed, and lafte the steamer had. An
at full speed under her hard-a-starboard helm about a minute,
the sails of the barque were discovered crossing the steamer's
bows to the eastward; the steamer immediately blew several
alarm whistles, and the officer of the deck saw the barque
luffing to starboard; the steamer's engines were thereupon
immediately reversed, and her wheel ported; but, being then
close to the barque, her headway could not be stopped in time
to avoid a collision, and she struck the barque upon her port
side between the main and mizzen rigging, with such force
that she penetrated the barque a distance of five feet and sank
her almost immediately. The captain and three of' the crew
were drowned.
1. Appellants' first exception is to the third finding of fact,
that "the Wind was blowing from the southwest or the southsouthwest," because it does not find the direction in which
the wind was blowing, and because the direction of the wind
was neither S.W. nor S.S.W., but S. There was, some conflict of testimony upon this point between the crews of the
respective vessels and the bbservers at the signal stations and
light-houses between Sandy look and Cape M,ay; but as the
District Judge was also of the opinion that the wind was
somewhere from S.W. to S.S.W. it is impossible for us to say
that there was no testimony to support this findin . If it
were impossible to ascertain, definitely from, the te.timony
whether it was from the S.W. or S.S.W., there was clearly no

Opinion of the Court.

obligation to find the exact point from which it was blowing.
As observed by the District Judge, this finding "confirms the'
previous conclusion that the barque up to the time of the collision had been sailing on a northeast course, since that would
bring such a wind about a point on her starboard quarter, as
all her witnesses testify."
2. The finding that the vessels could not discover one
another at a distance of on~eighth of a mile is substantially
'confirmed by all the testimony and by the opinion of the
District Judge, who makes a similar statement three or four
times in his opinion.
3. Appellants also except to the finding that the course'of
the barque was "about N. E." instead of a 6 out N. E. by N.
j N. ; but as the vessel had a free wind, and the usual course
at this point between Absecon and Barnegat on the New
Jersey coast, where the collision occurred, was N. E. or N. E.
by N. for vessels bound to New York from Cape. Henlopen,
a departure from that course will not be presumed in the
absence of some controlling reason. Indeed, the probability
that a steamer or a vessel sailing with a free wind will pursue
the course customarily pursued in that vicinity, by vessels
bound from and to the same port, is so strong, that a deviation from that course without apparent cause will not be
'considered as established without a clear preponderance of
testimony. The District Judge also found that the general
course of the vessel was N. E. until her wheel was put to port,
just before the collision. Exception was also taken to the
finding that "the steamship was going about eleven knots an
hour." As the appellants claim in their brief she was making
eleven knots an hour, and both courts agree in this opinion, it.
is difficult to see why an exception was taken to this finding..
4. The fourth, fifth, and seventh exceptions are dependent
upon the construction to be given to the several findings made
by the court, and are not to the findings themselves, and hence
are impertinent. The sixth exception is unimportant.
5. The remaining ten exceptions to the findings of fact are

tions to the opinion of the Circuit Court, embodied in a single
exception - the, seventeenth ; and thirty-five exceptions to the
refusal of the court to find the facts and conclusions of law as
requested, by the claimants. But the substance of all these
objections to the findings and opinion of the Circuit Court
turn upon those contained in the paragraph, above cited, which
indicate that the change of course made by the barque just
prior to the collision was an error in extremis, for which the
barque was not responsible. This was the point upon which
the Circuit ,and District Courts chiefly differed, and upon
which the stress of the case was laid. The finding in question
was as follows: "The whistle of the steamer first heard by
those in~charge of the barque indicated to them that the vessels were quite near to each other. They thought the steamer'
was approaching bearing abeam on the barque's port side.
Immediately after they saw her masthead-light and then her
green light, whereupon the mate told the wheelsman to port
the wheel, and called to those below to save themselves. The
mvn at the wheel had hardly got the wheel over when the
steamer struck the barque. During the time the steamer was
running under her hard-a-starboard wheel she changed her
course to the eastward three or four points, and the barque,
after she luffed, changed her course one or two points by the
time the vessels came together."
In this connection the allegation of the original libel was
that "the wind at the time was W.S.W., and the said barque
was heading E. by N. J- N., running free, and going at the
rate of about three knots an hour.

.

.

. That when the

said steamer was close upon the said barque, and the impending collision inevitable, and in the effort to 'escape the same,
order was given to port the barque's, helm, which order was
obeyed, but did not alter the course of said barque more than
a point, and in a direction away from the said approaching
steamer." The answer denied "that such order was given
when the collision was inevitable, or that it did not alter the
course of the barque more than a point, or that such alteration was in a direction away from the approaching steamer;"
and averred " that at about ten o'clock and fifty minutes the

Opinion of the Court.

second mate in the pilot house heard the- blast of a fog horn
about a point or so on the starboard bow of the steamer,
whereupon he ordered the wheel of said steamer to be put
hard-a-starboard, which order.was obeyed, and was the proper
order, and would have been efficient for the avoiding of the
collision but for the change of course on the part of the barque,
hereafter spoken of.

.

.

.

That when, or almost immedi-

ately qfter, the helm of the said steamer was starboarded, the
helm of said barque was ported, and her head began to come
up towards the course of the said steamship; that said change
of course of said barque was at once seen and reported by the
lookout on the steamer and seen by her second mate in the
pilot-house, and that as soon as such change was seen, and
when the head of the steamer had been changed about a point
under her starboard helm, her helm was put hard-a-port, and
her engine was. stopped and reversed.

.

.

.

And these

respondents allege that the said barque changed her course
under her port wheel four or five points before the collision,
and that at the time of the collision she was heading about
east and said steamer was heading about S. or S. .by W., and
that such change of course on the part of the barque carried
her across the bow of the said steamship, which had taken the
proper measures to avoid her, and, but for the said change of
course on the part of said barque, would have succeeded in
doing so."
The case was tried upon these allegations, and the District
Judge found that all the witnesses agreed that, at the time of
the collision, the bat'que "'was heading about E. or E. by N.,
or about four points to the eastward of the usual course for
vessels bound for New York ;" that the testimony of the"
mate and wheelsman of- the barque, who were the officers of
the deck, that her course prior to the collision was E.,by N.
j- N., was untrue and wholly irreconcilable with the admitted'
facts, and with the other accredited testimony; and inferentially, at least, that their testimony was fabricated for the
purpose of demonstrating that the change of course from E.
by N. - N. to E. or E. by N. (from half a point to a point and
a half) was so slight that it mast have been made in exlrem'k,
VOL. CXLVu-6

S'OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

while, if the course of the barque had been N.E., the change
would have been from three to four points. The District
Court found the 'course to have been N.E.; that this course
was continued until the helm was ported; and that the
"change of three to four points was too great and was commenced too early and too far off from the steamer to be
regarded as a change inm exremis, and as this change of course
evidently contributed to the collision the barque must also be
held chargeable with fault." A decree was thereupon rendered apportioning the damages, and both parties appealed to
the Circuit Court.
Pending that appeal, the libel was amended by averring
be by said barque's
that "the wind at the time appeared
compasses W.S.W., and the said barque was heading, as it appeared by said compasses, E. by N. - N., running free, and
going at the rate of about three knots an hour.

.

.

.

That

the said barque was an iron vessel and had a list to starboard,
and her compasses were affected by those facts, and she had a
deviation card on board, by means of which corrections in the
-readings of said compasses were made, which said deviation
card was lost with said vessel, and, the master being drowned,
libellants were unable to more accurately state the said deviation than that it was between one and three points on different courses."
Exceptions were filed to this libel for indefiniteness and
insufficiency, and a second amended libel was filed, averring
"that the wind at the time appeared to be, by said barque's
compasses, W.S.W. Libellants believe that the true direction
of the wind was S.W.; that the compasses of the barque indicated it to be W:S.W. for the reasons hereinafter stated. The
said barque was heading, as it appeared by said compasses,
E. by N.- J N.,- and libellants believe her true heading was
N.E.' E., and that the said heading appeared to be E. by N.
N., by ,said barque's compasses, for the reasons hereinafter
stated." The previous allegation with regard to deviation
was repeated with the addition that "libellants believe that
suh'.deviation on a true N.E. j E. course was two points, so
that the course appeared by said barque's compasses to be E.

THE

CITY OF NEW YORK.
Opinion of the Court.

by N. I N." To this amended libel an answer was filed and
the case went to trial in the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court
was of opinion that if the barque changed her course four or
five points to the starboard, as claimed by the steamship, such
change could not have been made when the vessels were
within two or three hundred feet of each other; that, if it
could. be demonstrated that, at the time of the collision, the
barque was headed about east, and that her course previous to
the change was N.E., the argument for the steamer would be
convincing; but that this could not be demonstrated unless
the testimony of the wheelsman of the steamer, who gave the
course on which the steamer 'was headed when the barque's
change of course took place, and also when the collision took
place, was accepted as correct. "It is highly improbable,"
said the court, "that in the excitement and confusion of the
moment the helmsman of the steamer looked at his compass
so carefully as to accurately note the steamer's course when he
was ordered to put his wheel hard-a-port, and again when the
collision took place. Equally improbable is his testimony,
that while the steamer was under a hard-a-starboard helm her
course was only changed about three-quarters of a point,
although she was running at full speed for a minute under
that helm, and, that while she was under her helm hard
a-port, at the time she was reversing her engines, her course
was changed a point and three-quarters to starboard."
The court conceded that, the mate of the barque, who was
the only witness who attempted to give her course by the compass, was not entitled to any credit, but that the testimony of
the wheelsman, the lookout, and the engineer of the. steamer
so strongly confirmed, the testimony of the witnesses for the
barque, to the effect that her change of course was not made
until the vessels were so close together, that a collision was
unavoidable, that it was not necessaryto devote any-time to
the attempt to ascertain what the course of the barque was
previously to the time this change was made. "All the witnesses for the steamer agree that the barque's change of course
took place under their observation, and , that the steamer
sounded an alarm of successive blasts of her steam whistle- and

OCTOBER TERMf, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

reversed her engines."

The court evidently was not satisfied

with the testimony that the barque was headed east, or nearly

so, at the moment of impact, and gave weight to the testimony
of a diver who visited the wreck a few days after the collision,
and testified that she was lying at the bottom of the ocean
headed about N.N.E. on a line parallel, with the shore. It
thought this testimony more persuasi in fixing her heading
approximately than the conjectural opinions of witnesses
formed in the excitement and confusion of the moment, who
thought she was headed about east. In short, it came to the
conclusion that the change of cpurse which brought the two
vessels together was made by the steamer, while running a
minute under her hard-a-starboard helm, rather than by the:
barque, and that, upon this assumption, if the course of the'
barque were changed only one or two points, the vessels would
have come together at the angle shown in the diagrams of the
witnesses upon both sides. It was evidently of the opinion
that the testimony that the barque was headed east, or nearly
so, at the moment bf collision, indicating, as it did, a change of
bourse of three or four points, was outweighed by the testimony of the witnesses that, whatever change :of course was
made, took place when the vessels were in plain sight of each
other, and so close together that a collision was unavoidable.
Upon the findings of the Circuit Court there can be no question of the gross negligence of the, steamship. She was not
only not running at the moderate speed required by rule 2i, but
she failed to take the proper precautions wheir the proximity
of the sailing vessel became known to her. Upon hearing the
fog hotn of the barque only one'point on her starboard bow,
the officer in charge should at once have checked her speed,
and, if the sound indicated that the approaching vessel was
near; should have stopped or reversed until the sound was
definitely located, or the vessels came in sight of each other.
Indeed, upon the testimony in this case, it is open to doubt
whether, if the engiue bad been at once stopped, the steamer
would'have come to a standstill before she had crossed the
course of the barque. There is no such certainty of the exact
position of a hbrn blown in a fog as will justify a steamer in

Opinion of the Court.

speculating upon the probability of avoiding it by a change of
the helm, without taking the additional precaution of stopping
until its location is definitely ascertained. The Rypodane,-6

So far as the case of the barque is concerned, there was evidently testimony to support the findings of the Circuit Court,
and if these findings are consistent, and justify its conclusion
of law that the barque's change of course was an error in
extremis, we cannot do otherwise than affirm the decree. In
view of the recklessness with which the steamer was navigated
that evening, it is no more than just that the evidence of contributory negligence on the part of the sailing vessel should be
clear and convincing. Where fault on the part of one vessel is
established by uncontradicted testimony, and such fault is, of
itself, sufficient to account for the disaster, it is not enough for
such vessel to raise a doubt with regard to the management of
the other vessel. There is some presumption at least adverse
to its claim, and any reasonable doubt with regard to the propriety of the conduct of such other vessel should be resolved in
its favor. Taking the finding of the Circuit Court, that the
course of the barque was*about N.E., in connection with the
fact that after she luffed she changed her course but one or
two points by the time the vessels came together, it is evident
that that court did not agree with the District Court that she
was headed E. or E. by N. at the time of the collision. Nor
is this finding inconsistent with his further finding that ivhen
the barque was first seen the officers of the steamer discovered
that her course was eastward, since that may be construed as
any point east of north. The evident gist of the steamer's
complaint is the refusal of the Circuit Court to find the heading of the barque at the moment of collision. Had it found
such course to be E. or E. by N., as the answer averred, :nd as
much of the testimony indicated, it would necessarily follow
that she must have changed her course from three to four
points under her hard-a-port helm -a change scarcely consistent with an error in extremis. But the testimony upon this

Opinion of the Court.

point was that of the mat6 and the wheelsman of the barque,
and is a mere inference from their thoroughly discredited testimony that the course of the barque was E. by YN., and
that she swung only a point to starboard. flaving once found
that this was not the course of the barque, and that such course
was N.E., this testimony falls to the ground. The testimony
of the mate and wheelsman of the steamer, that the barque
-was heading E. by N. or E. by N. I. N. at the moment of collision, was evidently nothing but a mere guess. Indeed, it is
very improbable that, in the excitement and consternation
occasioned by the immediate presence of such a peril, the
-wheelsman of either vessel would stop to look at the compass
or notice the bearing, even of his own vessel, much less that
of the other. While the testimony of the diver, that her heading after she was sunk was N.N.E., may not have been entitled to great weight, it was a circumstance tending to support
the theory that she was not heading E. by N. It is evident
that if her general course were N.E., and, her helm were put
hard-a-port, as all agree it was, she could not have been head.ing N.N.E. at the time of the collision. It is evident that the
Circuit Court was dissatisfied with all the testimony upon the
subject of the barque's heading at the time of the collision,
and rested its conclusion upon the finding that, during the
time the steamer was running under her hard-a-starboard
wheel, she changed her course to the eastward two or three
.points, and the barque, after she luffed, changed her course,
but one or two points by the time the vessels came together.
Taken in connection with the further finding that the mate
told the wheelsman to port the wheel after he saw the mast
headlight and the green light of the steamer, it justified the
conclusion that this order was given in erern'is.
The court evidently thought that more satisfactory evidence
of the heading of the two vessels at the time of the collision
was derived from the fact that the steamer while running at
11 miles an hour put her helm hard-a-starboard from one to
two minutes prior to the collision. At this rate of speed it is
by no means improbable that she swung three or four points
before the collision took place, while the other testimony left
