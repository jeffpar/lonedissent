STATES ex fel. TRASK v. WANAMAKER.

To TErE SU-REmE

COURT

OF

THE DISTRICT OF COLD3BIA.

No. 1232. Argued and submitted December 20, 21, 1892.-

Decided January 3,1893.

Aawrit of error does not lie to a judgment' of the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia, denying a writ of, mandamus to the Postmaster
General to compel him to readjust the salary of a postmaster when the
additional amount to become due him would be less than $5000; and this
is not affected by the fact that many similar claims for relief exist, in
which the aggregate amount involved is over $100,000.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
MPr. ilavey Spalding for plaintiff in error.
J.'. Asit tant Attorney General JMiaury filed a brief for
defendant in error, but the court declined to hear him.

M .. CHIEF JUSTI=E FULL-ER delivered the opinion of the
court.
The relator applied for the writ of error herein to one of the
justices of this court by a petition, setting up the alleged
errors relied on, and stating that the,quegtions of law involved'
"concern the interest of more than one thousand persons, expostmasters, who reside in many different States and Terri"tories, and are in like case with herself and who have presented claims for like relief before the Postmaster-General,
and that all of such claims amount to more than one hundred
thousand dollars;" and praying that the writ be allowed
"under section 706 of the Revised Statutes." The order
was thereupon granted.
Upon an almost identical petition, a writ of err6r was
allowed in United States v. -ilas, 124 U. S. 86, but no question as to the pecuniary amount involved in its relation to
jurisdiction, or as to the repeal of section 106, was suggested
by counsel or considered by the court.

- OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Syllabus.

Section 706 of the Revised Statutes and section 848 of the
Revised Statutes~of the District of Columbia, which provided
for the allowance of appeals and writs of error by the justices
of this court under special circumstances, are no longer in
force. Act of February 25, 1879, c. 99, 20 Stat. 320, c. 99;
Railroad Co. v. Grant, 98 U. S. 398; -Dennison v. Alexander,
103 U. S. 522; Act of March 3, 1885, 23 Stat. 443., c. 355;
Cross v. Bfurke, 146 U. S. 82, 87.
The sum in dispute on this record, exclusive of costs, is more
than one thousand and less than five thousand dollars. It is
well settled that our appellate jurisdiction, when dependent
upon the sum or value really in dispute between the parties,.is
to be tested without regard to the collateral effect of the judgment in another suit between the same or other parties. It is
the direct effect of the judgment that can alone be considered.
NYew England Xfortgage Co. v. Gay, 145 U. S. 123; W-ashington aid Georgetown Railroad Co. v. .Districtof 0olumiaj 146
U. S. 227.
This case does not come within either of the sections of the
act of March 3, 1885, regulating appeals and writs of error
from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and the
writ of error must, therefore, be
.Dimised.

The maker of a promissory note signed it entirely for the benefit of the
payee, who was really the party for whose use it was made. The maker
and the~payee were citizens of the same State. A citizen of another
State discounted the note, and paid full consideration for it to the payee,
who endorsed it to him. The note not being paid at maturity, the endorsee, who had not _parted with it, brought suit upon it against the
maker in the .Circuit Court of the United States. Held, that the court
had jurisdiction, notwithstanding the provision in the act of August 13,
