JENNINGS v. COAL RIDGE COAL CO.
Statement uf the Case.

him for repayment, or that Shropshire and his wife Iso understood. The indebtedness was joint and not several. There is,
however, included in this amount of $5778.80 a note of $1000
of Augustus and Alexander C. Shropshire, with interest from
December 1, 1877, to January 1, 1881, amounting to $327.83,
which should be excluded as individual indebtedness of A. C.
Shropshire and not properly chargeable in this account. All
equitable considerations are open in such a suit, and we think
that the equities require that John Lyle should receive an additional credit of $4450.97. The balance due upon the account
stated, corrected in this particular, would be $3356.34.
TIe decree is reversed and the cause remanded,witA a direction to enter a decree for the amount of $3356.34 with

JENNINGS v. COAL RIDGE IMPROVEMENT AND
COAL COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVAINIA.
Io. 98. Argued December 21, 1892.-Decided January 3,1893. â€¢

Bell's Gap Bailroad Co. v. .Pennsylvania,134 U. S. 232, affirmed to the point
that a provision in a state law for the assessment of a state tax upon
the face value of bonds instead of upon their nominal value violates no
provision of the Constitution of the United States.

THE brief of the plaintiff in error stated his case as follows:
"W. W. Jennings is the owner of $20,000 of the registered
mortgage bonds of the Coal Ridge Improvement and Coal
Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, upon which bonds by
the terms thereof, there was due him on the first day of
December, 1887, six months' interest amounting to $600. The
total issue of bonds secured by the mortgage is $200,000.
The company being financially embarrassed was not in funds

OCTOBER TERM, 1892.
Opinion of the Court.

to pay the interest maturing December 1, 1887. It made an
arrangement with most of its bondholders for an extension of
two years. Jennings was asked to agree to this arrangement,
but refused, threatening foreclosure unless the interest due
him were fully and promptly paid. The company thereupon
tendered him $570, being the interest due, less $30, which the
treasurer of the company proposed to deduct for state tax
alleged to be due, at the rate of three mills per annum upon
the nominal or par value of the bond. Jennings agreed to
submit to the deduction of a tax based upon the actual value
of the bonds, which did not exceed 75 per centum of par, but
the treasurer of the company insisting that he was compelled
by law to assess them at par, regardless of actual value, refused
to make any concession."
"The decision of the trial court being in favor of Jennings,
the Coal Ridge Company carried the case to the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania, assigning as error the affirmance of
the above and other points by the trial court. The Supreme
Courb of Pennsylvania reversed the ruling of the trial court
and, allowing the tax, reduced the judgment to $570, to correct
which action-this writ of error was taken."
