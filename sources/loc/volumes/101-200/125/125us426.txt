3RROR TO THE

I OcUIT COURT OF THE 'UTED
DISTRICT OF WM .

STATES FOR THE

Io. 150. Argued January 30, 31, 188.-Decided April 2, 1888.

In Maine, the plaintiff in a replevin suit for ice, gave a bond, with sureties,
to the defendant, m the penalty of $30,000, conditioned to prosecute the
suit to flnal judgment, and pay such damages and costs as the defendant should recover against them, "and also return and restore the same
goods and chattels in like good order and condition as when taken, in
case such shall be the final judgment." The ice was stated in the bond
to be of the value of $15,000. In the suit there was a judgment for a
return of the ice to the defendant, and for an amount of damages ascertained by the jury by allowing interest from the time the ice was taken,
on a sum found-to have been its value where and when it was taken, and
also allowing the expenses of the Jefendant in preparing to remove the
fce. The damages were paid but the ice was not returned. In a suit on
the bond, Held,
(1) The plaintiff in that suit was entitled to recover what the jury in the,
replevin suit bad found to have been the value of the "ice where
and when it was taken, with interest thereon from the date of the
verdict in the replevin suit;
(2) It was not competent for the obligors in the bond to show that the
ice was of less value than the amount stated in the writ of replevin
and the bond; but it was competent for the obligee to show-that
such value was greater;
(3) The finding of the jury in the replevin suit as to the value, of the ice
where and when it was taken, was competent and conclusive evidence, as against the obligors, of such value.

BLArcHronD delivered the opinion of the court.

On the 12th of August, 1870, the Washington Ice Company,
a New York corporation, procured from the Supreme Judicial
Court of the State of :Maine a writ of replevin, directed to the
sheriff of the county of Lincoln, in that State, commanding
him to replevy "a certain lot of lce, beihg about thirty-eight
hundred tons of ice, now lying and being in certain ice-houses
situate in the town of Boothbay, in the county of Lincoln and
State aforesaid, and owned or occupied by :Nathamel Webster,
of Gloucester, in the county of Essex and Commonwealth of
lMassachusetts, of the value of fifteen thousand dollars, belongnow taken and
ing to the Washington Ice Company,
detained by NathamelWebstet, . . . and them deliver unto
the said The Washington Ice Company," and summon the defendant to appear before the court within and for the county
of Lincoln on the fourth Tuesday of October, 1870,to answer
unto the plaintiff.in a plea of replevin, for that the defendant,
on the 1st of August, 1870, at said Boothbay, unlawfully took
the goods of the plaintiff as aforesaid and them unlawfully
detained; "provided they, the said plaintiffs, shall give bond
to the said defendant, %vith sufficient sureties, in the sum of
thirty thousand dollars, being twice the value of the said goods
and chattels, to prosecute the said replevin to final judgment,
and to pay such damages and costs as the said defendant shall
recover against them; and also to.return and restore the same
goods and chattels in like good order and condition as when
taken, in case such shall be the final'judgment."
The sheriff made a return to the .writ, dated August 13th,
1870, as follows: "By virtue of ais writ I have taken the ice

within named, as the property of the within-named Washington Ice Company, and, on'the nineteenth day of August,
D. 1870, I delivered said ice to fliram Perkins, whom the

Washington Ice Co. designated as their agent to receive said
ice; and, on the nineteenth day, I summoned the within-named
Nhathaniel Webster, by reading this writ in his presence and
hearing, for his appearance at court-the quantity replevied,
by actual weight, being about twenty-five hundred tons."
Webster pleaded the general issue to the writ, at October
Term, 1871, and fied a brief statement and special matter in
defence, setting forth, that, at the time of the alleged taking,
as stated m the writ, the ice named therein was not the property of the plaintiff, nor had the plaintiff any right to the possession thereof, butit was the property of the defendant and
one Babson, and was rightfully in the possession of the defandant, and was wrongfully taken from his possession by the
plaintiff; and prayed judgment for the return of the ice in
like good order and condition as when it was taken from the
possession of the defendant, and for damages for such taking
and detention, and for costs.
The case came on for trial before a jury, and evidence was
put in; but the case was taken from the jury and submitted
to the full court, on the report of the evidence by the judge,
and transferred to the Supreme Judicial Court for the :Middle
fDistrict. It was there heard, and is reported as Wamington
Im Co. v. "Weoter, 62 Maine, 34:1.
It is there stated, that the case came before the full court
under an agreement that, if the action was maintainable, it
was to stand for trial, but otherwise a nonsuit was to be entered. On June 26, 18%T, the order of the fall court was received, in these words: "The nonsuit to stand, judgment for
return of the goods replevied, damages to the time of taking
to be assessed at nsi imu, if the defendant so elect, or he
may, if he -prefer, resort to his remedy on the bond.' The
case was then continued to October Term, 1874, when the
defendant elected to have his damages assessed by a jury.
The case was then continued to April Term, 1875, when leave
was granted. to the officer who served the writ, to amend his

return thereon in accordance with the facts; and thereupon
-hemade the following as Ins amended return, which was allowed by the court, such amended return bearng date August
13, 1870: "By virtue of this writ, ha-Ving first taken a bond
as prescribed by law, I have this day replevied all the ice by
me found in the ice-houses within mentioned, all of which
said ice I caused to be weighed on delivery at the wharf in
said ,Boothbay, about three miles frim said ice-houses, being
the nearest place thereto where ice could be shipped -twentytwo hundred and ninety-seven tons and nineteen hundred and
twenty-one pounds of which was thus' weighed on successive
dlays, portions of it on each week day between the twentythird day of August, 1870, and the sixteenth day of Septeinber, 1870, and thirty-three tons and nineteen hundred and
thirty pounds thereof was thus weighed on three several days
between the. twenty-sixth day of September, 1870, and the
twenty-sixth day of October, 1870, the whole of said ice thus
taken by me weighing twenty-three hundred and thirty-one
tons and eighteen hundred and fifty-one pounds, and, on the
nineteenth day of said August, 1870, I delivered all the said
ice at said ice-houses to the plaintiff, reserving to myself authority to weigh the same; and, on the nineteenth day of said
August I summoned the within-named N~athaniel Webster to
appear at coirt, as within directed, by reading this writ aloud
in his presence and hearng."
The action of replevin was tried by a jury, and the presiding judge submitted to them to find, in addition to their verdict, answers to two questions; and the ju., on the 14th of
:&ay, 1875, Teturned the following verdict: "The jury find
that the defendant waf damaged by reason of the takng.of
the property rellevied in the suit, and assess damages for the
defendant in the sum of six thousand five hundred and fiftyfive dollars." They also returned answers as follows to the
questions submitted to them: "1First. What was the value
of the ice replevied, where it was situated, at the time it was
.taken in this suit I Answer. Twenty thousand and sixtynine dollars and thirty-three cents. Second. What damage
did the defendant sustain by reason of the taking of the ice in

480

Opinion of the Court.

replevin, on account of the preparations he had to make to
remove it? Answer. Eight hundred and thirty-five dollars
and twenty-five cents." The plaintiff filed exceptions to the
rulings of the judge m matters of law, and also moved to set
aside the verdict. The evidence was reported to the full court,
and the case was transferred to the Supreme Judicial Court
for the Middle District, where it was heard, and is reported
s ' r.4ingt Ice (7o. v. WeFst-r,- 68 "game,449. The decision of the court was, that the motion and exceptions should
be ,overruled. Thereupon, a judgment was rendered by the
lower court, on the 4th of :May, 1878, that the property replevied be returned and restored to Webster irrepleviable,
and that he recover against the Washington Ice Company
$7723.98, dimages for the taking and detaining of the property replevied, being the amount of the verdict, with interest
thereon to the date of the judgment, and also $47T.67, costs
of suit.
On the 31st of 'July,1878, a writ of return was issued on
the judgment. It recited that the Washington Ice Company
had replevied the 2331 tons and 1851 pounds of ice, of the
value of $20,069.38, and set forth the terms of the judgment
for' the return, and for the recovery of the $7723.98 damages
for the taking and the $177.67 costs, and commanded the
sheriff that he fofthwith return and restore the said property
to Webster, and collect the said sums of money from the
Washington Ice Company, with interest from the 4th of M:ay,
1878. On the, 19th of August, 1878, a demand was duly
made upon the Washmgton Ice Company, for the return of
the ice mentioned in the writ of restitution.
On the 17th of September, 1878, the Washmgton Ice Company paid to Webster $8379.36 in full for such damages and
costs, and interest. The receipt given by Webster for the
amount contained this clause: "This receipt not to affect
any further claim of the within-named Webster for the ice
named in paid.writ, or for any f~irther damages or costs that
may be recovered or recoverable by said Webster."

stated by hun in the amended return, exacted a bond in the
penalty of $30,000, dated August 12, 1870, executed by the
Washington Ice Company, as principal, and Josiah H. Drummond and William E. Gould, to Webster, the condition of
which was as follows- "The .condition of the above obligation is such, that, whereas the said The Washington Ice Company have this day commenced against the said NathanieI
Webster an action of replevin for a certain lot of ice, being
about thirty-eight hundred. tons of 'ice, now lying and being
'in certain ice-houses situate in the town of Boothbay, in the
county of Lincoln, and State of Maineowned or occupied by
Nathaniel Webster, of Gloucester, in the county of Essex and
Commonwealth of Mfassachusetts, of the value of fifteen thousaud dollars, which they say the said Nathamel 'Webster has
unlawfully taken: Now, therefqre, if the said The Washington
Ice Company shall prosecute. the said replevin to final judgment, and pay such damages and costs as the said Nathaniel
Webster shall recover against them, and also return and restore the same goods and chattels in like good order and condition as when taken, in case such shall be the final judgment,
then the said obligation to be void, otherwise, to remain in
full force."
On the 13th of February, 1879, Webster brought the present action of debt, in the Circuit Court of the United States
for the District of Maine, against the Washington Ice Company and Drummond and Gould, founded on the said bond.
The defendants appeared, and by their plea-prayed oyer of the
bond and its condition, and sdt forth the condition, and
pleaded that- they had kept all the conditions of the bond
except the following, namely, "1and also return and restore
the same goods and chattels in like good order and condition
as when taken, in case such shall be the final judgment;"
that, as to that condition, they had not kept it; that final
judgment had been rendered against them in the replevin suit
mentioned in the condition, for a return of *the goods and
chattels replevied thereto; that they had not returned the
same to the plaintiff according to the reqmrement of said
condition; and that they, therefore, submitted to the jidg.

Opinion of the Court.

ment of the court and prayed that they nght be heard by
the court in equity in the assessment of the damages for the
breach of the last mentioned condition. On the 12th of
October, 1880, the defendants filed an offer to be defaulted,
and that judgment might be rendered against them for $16,000
and legal costs,.and execution nnght issue against them for
the same. That offer was declined by the plfitiff on the 1st
of lNovemberi 1880. At September Term, 1882, the case was
tried before the Circuit Court on the filing of a written stipulation waiving a jury. At the conclusion of the trial, the
court directed a judgment for Webster against the defendants
to be entered, for $28,990..14, and costs, which was done. To
review that judgment, the defendants have brought this writ
of error.
There is a bill of exceptions, upon which various questions
are raised by the plaintiffs in error. At the trial, the plaintiff
introduced in ev.idence the.original writ of replevin in the suit
in the state court, the return and the amended return, the
pleadings in that suit, the- record of the judgmeit and of the
proceedings of the court theretn, and the two orders of
the full court. The defbndants objected to the admission of
the following question -to the jury and their answer thereto,.
recited in the record of the proceedings in the replevin suit,.
namely: " What was the value of the ice replevied, where it
was situated at the time it was taken in this suit ? Answer.
Twenty thousand and sixty-nine dollars and thirty-three
cents." The court overruled the objection and admitted the
question and answer, and the defendants excepted.
The plaintiff then introduced in evidence the writ of return,
and'the fact of the making, upon the defendants of the demand for the return of the ice replevied; and the receipt given
by him to the Washington Ice Company for the damages,
costs, and interest awarded by the judgment. of May 4, 1878.
He also introduced in evidence the bond sued upon.
The bill of exceptions then proceeds as follows - ",The
plaintiff thereupon contended, that the defendants were
estopped to deny that the goods replevied were at least of
the value set forth in the writ of replevin and in the replevin

to .beassessed, but that the plaintiff was not precluded from
shiowing that.they were of greater value.
it The defefdnAts -launed that they were not thus estopped
or precluded, and offered evidence to show that the value of
the ice replevied was less than ten thousand dollars, at whatever time such value is to be assessed, and submitted to the
court the following prayer for a ruling on this subject, viz. :
That the defendants are not estopped to prove that the value
of the geods replieved.was less than fifteen thousand dollars
by reason of the inseftion of that sum in'the replevin writ and
bond as the value of the goods which the officer in that writ
was commanded to replevy. .
" The court rejected the evidence offered, and overruled this
prayer of the defendants, and -ruled that the defendants are
estopped as is contended by the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff*
is not precluded from showing that the value of the goods
replevied was more than fifteen thousand dollars. To which
rejection of evidence and rfling the defendants then excepted.
"1
The defendants contended that the statement of the officer
who served the replevin writ, m .his returns thereon, of the
quantity of goods actually taken by him on the writ of replevin, is competent and conclugive evidence of that quantity,
in the trial-of this action upon the replevm bond, and submitted
to the court a. prayer for a ruling to that effect.
"The plaintiff contended that the statement of the officer,
in his return, of the quantity of ice replevied, being indefinite
in the first return, and in the amended return being of weights
taken at a different place from that at.which the ice was
replevied, and at subsequent times from that of the taking,
was not evidence of the quantity of the ice replevied.
"The court overruled the said prayer of the defendants in
this respect, and ruled that neither of the xetarns was conclusive evidence of the .quantity taken by the officer upon the
replevin writ. To which rulings the defendants then excepted.
"It was admitted by the plaintiff that the.damages which
were assessed in the action of replevin, for the .taking and
detention by the plaintiff in 'that action, of the property

replevied therein, with the interest thereon, and the costs
recovered in that action, with interest thereon, have been fully
paid, and that the judgment in that action, awarding to the
defendant in the same the sum of seven thousand seven hundred and twenty-three dollars and ninety-eight cents damages,
and his costs of suit taxed at four hundred and seventy-seven
dollars and sixty-seven cents, has been fully satisfied.
"Thereupon the defendants contended, that the damages
which the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action are the
value of the goods replevied, or of goods of like description,
character, and intrinsic value, at the date of the judgment in
the action of replevn, and of the order therein that the property replevied be returned and restored to the said Nathaniel
Webster, with interest thereon; and they offered evidence to
prove, that the value of ice of like description, character, intrinsie value, and quantity as that replevied, at the place where
the ice was replevied, and also at the place where the demand
upon the writ of return was made, was less than ten thousand
'dollars at that time. The court rejected the evidence offered,
and overruled this prayer of defendants. To which rejection

which the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action are the
value of the goods replevied, or of goods of like quantity,
description, character, and intrinsic value as those replevied,
at the date of said demand. But the. court rejected the evidence offered, overruled this prayer of the defendants, and
ruled that the plaintiff in this action is entitled to recover the
value of the ice replevied at the time it was taken by the dfficer upon the replevin writ. To which rejectionof evidence
and rulings the defendants- then excepted.
"The plaintiff contended that the finding of the value of

the ice replevied, by the jury which assessed the damages for
taking the ice upon the replevin -writ, against the plaintiff in
that suit, in answer to the question ubmitted to them m that
trial, ' What was the value of the icereplevied, where it was
situated, at the time, it was taken in this suit?' as appears in
the record of the proceedings in the action of replevin, is evidence in this action upon the bond; and is conclusive against
the defendants of the value of the ibe, in determining the
amount which the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action,
and moved the court for an entry of judgment against the
defendants, for the sum found by the jury in answer to that
question, -viz., the sum of twenty thousand and.sixty-nine- dollars and thirty-three cents, with interest thereon from the date
of that finding, and that execution issue for such sum.
"The defendants resisted this motion, and contended that
the value of the ice replevied was not a legal issue in the replevm acti6n. and that they were not precluded from showing
that the-value -of the ice was less than the sum thus found;
and that said question and answer were not evidence to be
taken into consideration in determining the amount which the
plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action upon the bond;
and they further contended,-that, if the finding of value in
the action of 'replevin furnished the rule of damages to 16e assessed in this action, interest thereon should be cast only from
the date of the demand upon the writ of return, and not from
the date of that finding by the jury.
"The court overruled the defendants' position, sustained
the motion of the plaintiff, and ruled that the finding of value
by the jury in the action of replevin was con6lusive against
the defendants, and ordered judgment to be entered for the
sum of twenty-eight thousand nine hundrd andninety dollars
and fourteen cents damages, and that execution issue for that
sum, that being the amount of- the said sum of twenty thousand and sixty-nine dollars and thirty-three cents, with interest thereon from the date of said finding, Mffay 14, 1875. To
which rulings -of the. court, order, and decision, and entry of

OCTOBER TERM,

1887.

Opinion of the Court.

The positions of the parties as thus set forth in the bill of
exceptions are those taken by thexi on the argument before
this court. The material question in the case is, what damages the defendant shall pay for the failure to return the 2331
tons and 1851 pounds of ice to the plaintiff, after judgment
for its return was rendered. The jury in the replevin suit
assessed the damages of Webster at the sum of $6555. They
also found the value of the ice replevied, where it was situated
at the time it was taken in the replevin suit, to have been
$20,069.33. The ice was taken, under the writ of- replevin,
on the 13th of August, 18-70. The verdict of the jury was
rendered on the 14th of May, 1875. The interest on $20,069.33, at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, from August 13, 1870,
to May 14, 1875, a period of four years and nine months, was
$5719.75. Add- to that the sum of $835.25, found by the
jury to be the damage sustaned by Webster by reason of the
taking of the ice in replevin, on account of the preparations
he had to make to remove it, and it makes a total of $6555,
which was the exact amount assessed by the jury as damages
by reason of the taking of the property replevied. Thus, in
the judgment in the replevin suit, Webster recovered, as damages, in addition to the $835.25, interest at the rate of 6 per
cent per annum on $20,069.33, the value of the ice, where it
was situated, at the time it was taken, from August 13, 1870,
to May 14, 1875; and, in the present suit, he has recovered on
the bond the sum of $20,069.33, as the value of the ice, where
it was situated, at the time it was taken, and -mterest -on that
suln, at the rate of 6 Ter cent per annum, from May 14, 1875,
to the date of the verdict of the jury in the present suit, such
interest amounting to $8920.81. Therefore, in-thd two suits,
taken together, Webster has recovered, as the value of his ice
unlawfully taken from him by the writ of replevin on the 13th
of August, 1870, its value as it was situated at that time. $20,069.33, and interest thereon from that date, at 6 per cent. per
annum, to the date of the verdict of the jury in the present
suit on the bond. This is equal and exact justice, and no more,
so far as he is concerned. S.o far as the prncipal and the
sureties in the bond are concerned, they obligated themselves

WASHINGTON ICE CO. v. WEBSTER.
OplnioA of the Court.

that the principal should return and restore the goods taken
on the Writ 'of replevin, "in like good order and condition as
-when taken." The article taken was ice, a perishable commodity. None of that taken on the 13th of August, 1870, iau be
supposqd to have been in existence when the judgment of May
4 1878, for its return, was rendered, or when the writ of return
of July 31, 1878, was issued, or when the demand of August 19,
1878, for the return, was made. The same quantity of ice which
was taken on the writ was, by the bond, to be returned, 'in like
good order and condition as when taken. If a part of it had
been returned in like good order and condition, and 'the rest
of it had not been returned at all, ok returned not in such like
good order and condition, the obligors in the bond would have
been liable for the value, at the time when taken, of what was
not returned, and for the depreciation in value of what was not
returned in like goa Order and condition. In no other manner could the condition of the bond have been satisfied, and
the defeifdant in the writ of replevin hqeve been made whole,
according to the intent and purpose of The writ and of the
bond, and of the statute of Maine, under which the bond was
given. The writ and the bond were in the. form prescribed

by statute.
The principal argument on the part of the defendants in the'
present suit is, that in the statute of Maine, Rev. Stat. 1857
and 1871, c. 96, § 11, which provides, that, 'in a replevin
suit, "if it appears that the defendant is entitled to a return of
the goods, he shall have judgment and a writ of return accordingki- with damages for the taking and costs," the words
"1damages for th6 taking " mean all damages resulting from
the taking. and detention of the goods; that, if the defendant
in replevin recovers judgment for a return of the goods replevied, he may, at his election, have the damages which he
has sustained by-reason of the taking and detention of them,
.Iothe time of such judgment, assessed in the replevin suit, or
he may recover those damages in a suit on the bond, but cannot
have.both; that, if he elects, as he did in the present case, to
have his damages assessed in the replevin suit, he cannot, in a
subsequent suit on the bond, founded on a failure to return the

OCTOBER TERMI,

Opinion of the Court.

goods, recover-any damages which accrued prior to the judgment in the replevm suit, and, therefore, cannot recover for
any depreciation in the value of the goods which occurred
between the time of the taking and the date of the judgment
of return; that any damages collectible for such depreciation
must, if the defendant makes the election referred to, be assessed in the replevm suit, as an item of damajes resulting from
the detention of the goods; .and that, as the plaintiff in this

suit failed to Dave such damages assessed m the replevin suit.
he cannot recover them in the present suit.
This point seems to us, at best, to be altogether technical,
and not to be founded on any sound principle. By the terms
of the bond, it was made enforceable against the principal and
sureties if the principal should not pay su~h damages and costs
as Webster should recover against it, and should not also return and restore the goods replevied in like good order and
condition as when taken. Under the condition of the bond,
the sureties were liable to pay the damages recovered against
the principal by the judgment of Mfay 4, 1878, in case the principal had not paid them, as it did. By the judgment in the
present suit, they are only made liable according to their obligation, that their principal shall return and restore the goods
in like.good order and condition as when taken. Such we
consider to have been the effect of the rulings of the state court
in the re&levin suit, in 62 and 68 Maine.
In the case in 62 Mame,the court, commenting upon the
above recited provision of the Revised Statutes of 1871, c. 96,
§ 11, says, (p. 361:) "When the defendant makes a good title
to the goods replevied, he is entitled to damages for the interruption of his possession, the loss of the use of the goods from
the time of their replevin till their restoration, and for their
deterioration." It also says, (p. 362:) "The damages are to be
assessed to the time of the verdict for the defendant, upon the.
principles adopted in trover, save that the value of the property
is not to be included therein." It also says, (p. 363:) "It seems,
therefore, fully settled that in a replevin suit, when, damages
are not assessed at visi pim, or where a nonsuit is entered,
the defendant, when the property replevied Is not returned,

WVASHINGTON ICE CO. -v. WEBSTER.

Opinion of the Court.

may recover all damages sustained, in a suit upon the replevin
bond." It also.says, (p. 363,) that the plaintiff "is bound by
his replevin bond to restore the goods in like good order and
condition as when taken. He is responsible, if judgment is
against him, for the damaged or deteriorated condition of the
goods when restored2 Again, it says, (p. 364:) "When goods
not held under legal process are replevied, and after entry of
the -actionthe plaintiff becomes nonsuit and a return is ordered,
but the goods replevied are not forthcoming on demand, the
defendant, in a suit on the bond, is entitled to reQover, as
damages, the value of the goods when taken, and interest
thereon from the service of the writ to the time of the rendition of judgment." Again, (p. 364:) "If the market value of
the goods replevied.shall be less at the time of the demand on
the writ of return, than when the goods are taken, the loss
must fall on the plaintiff, by whose wrongful act the defendant
is deprived of his property. Besides, the plaintiff, having possession, might have sold them, which the defendant could not do."
-It is contended for the defendants, that, in this suit on the
replevin bond, Webster is entitled to recover, as damages, only
the value of the go6ds replevied, 'on the 19th of August, 1878,
the date of the demand on the writ of return, with interest
thereon; and some expressions of the court in the decision i i
62 l aine, supposed to tend in that direction, axe referred to.
But they are wholly inconsistent with the other expressions
of the court, above quoted, and contrary to reason and justice,
in their application to the present case, and also to authority.
One of the expressions thus relied on by the defendants is
this, (p. 363 .) "The damages being assessed to the time of
the verdict, if the goods replevied are not forthcoming on
demand on the writ of return, the defendant, in a suit by him
on the replevin bond, will be entitled to recover, as damages,
the value of the goods replevied at the date of the demand on
the writ of return, with interest thereon, the damages and
v.
costs assessed in the replevin suit, and interest. Sift
Barne8, 16 Pick. 194." But a reference to the case of Biqft
v. Baina shows that the remark of the court -had reference
to a case where the value of the property replevied had risen,

Opinion of the Court.

at the time of the demand on the writ of return, beyond what
it was at the time it was taken. The MAassachusetts statute
and practice in regard to replevin are the same as in -Maine.
The principle declared in Bwijft v. Bamev was, that the successful defendant in replevin was entitled to a full indemnity;
that the plaintiff in replevin, who caused the property to be
valued, might well be bound by the valuation, when it was
made to appear that the action was groundless, that it by no
means followed that the other party, who had no agency in
the valuation, was also to be bound; that the plaintiffs in the
suit on the bond were entitled to a full indemnity for the
damages sustained by the non-performance of the condition of
the bond, and that could not be obtained unless they should
be allowed to recover the actual value of the property replevledl at the time when it ought to have been restored on the
writ of restitution; and that, in the case then before the court,
that was the true measure of damages.
In Parkar v. ronds,8 :Mfet. 205, it is said that the property in &igft v. Barnes had -risen in value after it was replevied; and, in Parker v. &m&, as some of the property
had been sold at the time of the demand, and some was de"teriorated and depreciated in value by use, the .court said
that the value at the time of the demand would not be the
measure of damages without a proper allowance for the
depreciation.
The rule in Massachusetts seems well settled. In _Ligtm
v. Brown, 98 Mass. 515, which was a suit on a replevin bond,
the value of the property, at the time of the demand for its
return, was greater than the penal sum of tlie bond, but
though the obligors contended that the proper measure of
damages was its appraised value or its value at the time it was
replevied, the court said: "1The appraisal made in the replevin
suit is conclusive against the party by whom it was made.
Parker v. imonds, 8 Met. 205. But it is not admissible in
eviddnce against the present plaintiff, who, as defendant in the
replevin action, had no agency in procuring this valuation.

Opinion of the Court.

turn than at the date of the appraisal. The value at the date
of a demand for the restoration of the property in compliance
with the order of return is the measure of damages for which
the plaintifE contends, and to which, in the opinion of the
court, he is entitled. Swift v. Barnes, 16 Pick. 194:."
In Tuck v. .tos e, 58 Maine, 461, the market value of the
replevied property had increased from the time it was replevied to the time of the judgment for a return, and it was held,
in a suit on the bond, that the defendants .were liable for the
value of the property at the date of the judgment for a return,
with interest at six per cent from the date of that judgment
to the date of the judgment on the bond.
It is, therefore, manifest that the court, in its opinion in 62
Maine, did not mean that the time of the demand on the writ
of return was to be taken as the time for fixing the value of
the property in any other case than one where there had been
an increase in the value from thd time of the taking, to the
benefit of wjutch increase the defendant in the replevin suit
was entitled. v.
We see nothing inconsistent with these views in 9veS
Tuite, 104: Mass. 328. In that case the defendant in a replevin
suit had a judgment therein for a return, and for damagts
assessed by com~uting interest on the appraised value of the
goods replevied, from the date of the writ of replevin to the
date of the judgment; and, in a subsequent suit on the bond,
he sought to recover, not only the value of the property, with
interest from the date of the demand under the judgment, but
damages for inconvenience and loss resulting from the inter-

ruption of the possession of the property, which was the
machinery of a manufactory, and damages for the expense,
trouble, and delay attending the restoration of the establishment to its original condition. It was held that these damages were included in the damages recoverable in the replevin
suit. The case was a peculiar one, and the defendant in the
replevin suit did not, as in the present case, ask merely for an
allowance, as damages, of a continuation of the interest oiL

verdict in the replevin suit to the tihae of the verdict in the

Opinion of the Court.

suit on the bond; and the court did not pass on that question.
The decisions in Maine support the views taken by the
Circuit Court. In &nitk v. .Dilingluzm,'33 Maine, 38, in .a

suit on a replevin bond, the value of the property replevied, as
valued in the writ, was allowed, with interest from the date of
the bond. The interest was objected to. 1No damages had
been assessed in'the replevin suit. The court said: ,"
If damages for the takng had been assessed, as the statute provides,
up to the time when the nonsuit was ordered, the estimate of
damages in this suit for the detention would have commenced
at that period. But the record shows that no such assessment
was made. The wrong done to the plaintiffs consists in the
taking of their property, and in the delay of making compensation for it. There is nothmg in the statute which precludes
the allowance of interest on the value of the property from
the time when it was taken." It certainly can make no
difference in principle that part of such, interest is allowed m
the replevin suit and part in the suit on the bond, so long as
there is no duplication.
In Thoma v. eSpoford, 46 Maine, 408, the case of SmitAh v.
Dilingazm is cited by the court as authority for the proposition, that in a suit on the replevin bond the plaintiff may
recover damages for detention, although they were not
assessed in the judgment in the replevin suit.
T1 he opinion of the court in 68 Maine contains nothing to
support the views of the defendants. In that opinion it is
said, (p. 459 :) '" When this cause was first tried, the presiding
justice was of opinion that the action was not maintainable,
and that the defendant's claim for damages for the plaintiffs'
unlawful taking could only be determined in a suit upon the
replevin bond. By agreement of parties, the case was withdrawn from the jury, to be reported to the full court. If the
action could not be maintained upon the evidence offered and
introduced by the plaintiffs, a non-suit was to be entered. If
the action could be maintained, it was to stand for trial; and
the court were also authorized to pass upon the several propositions in respect to damages. made bythe defendant's counsel.

WASHINGTON ICE CO. v. WEBSTER.
Optntol1 of the Court.

Upon a full hearing of the questions of law raised upon the
report, it was detbrminmed that the action was not maintainable; and a non-suit in pursuance of the agreement of the parties was ordered. It was further decided that the defendant
had a right to have Ins damages assessed. 62 Mifame, 3411."
The trial- court had instructed the jury as to damages as
follows, (p. 452:) "The defendant is"entitled to the value of
that ice, at the time it was taken, and where it was situated,
for any lawful use to which it could be put, If it was valuable to use there, he is entitled to its value for use. If it was
valuable for sale, he is entitled to its value for sale. If it was
valuable to send to market, he is entitled to whatever value it
bore at the time and place for any market, not what it might
bring at another market, - I don't mean that - but its value
at Boothbay, on August 13, 1870, for any purpose to which it
might be put." On this the Supreme Judicidl Court remarked, (p. 461:) "To these instructions there can be no
reasonable objections urged. The value at the time and place
of taking is the rule."
The contention of the defendants that, on the recovery of
the judgment in replevin, the plaintiff in replevin was only
bound to restore the go6ds or to pay their money value at that
time, and that the liability for the breach of the replevin bondwould be discharged if the plaintiff. in replevin paid such sum
of money as would enable the defendant then to go .int the
market and buy goods of like description and value, is not
sound. Ice is-a peculiar article of property. The ice in question was taken in August, 1870, at a time of year when, as we
all know, ice has a larger value than at some other times of
the year. The defendant in the replevin suit was entitled to
the value of that ice as of that time, and of the place where
it was taken, as stated in the case in 68 Maine, for any lawful
use to which it could be put. It was also sgid by the court in
that case, (p. 462 :) "As the taking by the plaintiffs was
wrongful, the defendant is entitled to full indemnity. The
measure of damages is the actual value of the property to %he
plaintiffs as an article of merchandise or sale?' Under these
views, the defendant would not necessarily be made whole by

Opinion of the Court.

a sum of money sufficient to enable him to purchase in. the
market a like quantity of ice, eight years-after it was taken.
It is also conteided for the defendants in this suit, that the
Circuit-Court erred in rejecting the evidence offered by them
to show that the value of the ice replevied was less than
$10,000, at whatever time such value was to be assessed, and
in ruling that the plaintiff was not 'precluded from showing
that the value of the goods replevied was more than the"
$15,000 named in the replevin writ and the bond.
We do not think the court erred in rejecting the evidence
so offered by the defendants. The writ of replevin stated that
the quantity of ice was "about thirty-eight hundred tons,"
"of the value f fifteen thousand d6llars? The bond of the
12th of August, 1870, recited that the action was for "about
thirty-eight hundred tons of ice," "of the value of fifteen
thousand dollars." The first return of the sheriff, dated
August 13, 1870, specified the quantity of ice as "about twenty-five -hundred tons." The amended return specified the
quantity as being 2381 tons and. 1851 pounds. The jury,
in the trial of the replevin suit, found that the value of the
ice replevied, where it was situated, at the time it was
taken, was $20,069.33. The condition of the bond must be
held to -mean,that the quantity of goods replevied was to be
restored, leaving it to be ascertained what that quantity was.
It must be assumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the quantity taken by the jury as the basis of the
value they found, was the quantity named m the amended
return of the sheriff. The sureties in the bond were, by its.
terms, so connected -with the replevin suit, that they are bound
by the adjudications necessarily made in it. The jury could
not have found any basis for the calculation of the interest as
damages, unless they had found, as they did, the value of the
ice, where it was situated, at the time it was taken. The sureties are bound by that finding.
There was, therefore, no error in excluding the evidence so
offered by the defendants, or in. permitting the plaintiff to
sliow, as he did conclusively, by the record in the replevin
suit, that the value of the ice, where it was situated;' at the

WASHINGTON ICE CO. v. WEBSTER.
Ophnon of the Court.

time it was taken, was greater than the $16,000 named in the
writ of replevin -and the bond.
This is in accordance with the decisions in the Supreme
Tudicial Court of Maine. In .Thomm v. Syqfford, 46 :Name,
408, the court below had ruled that the plaintiff ip the suit on
the replevin bond was estopped from showing that the property was of greater value than that stated in the writ of restitution, which was-the value stated in the.writ of replevin, the
bond being for double that value, but the Supreme Tudicial
Court said: "The defendant in replevin ia not concluded by
the value of the property named in the bond or the writ. If
he was to be thus est6pped from denying that value, he would
be at the mercy of his opponentwhose interest it always is to

authorities and fair reason, that
not concluded or estopped by the sum named in the bond as
the actual value." To the same effecHs X ler v. .fo8ea, 56
:Maine, 128, 141. In -Duck v. .oses, 58 Maine, 461, 477, it ii held that the plaintiff in replevin is bound by the value whicli
he puts upon the property in his writ, but that with the defendant in replevin it is otherwise, and, as he has no hand in
.fixing the value in the writ, he is not estopped from showing
it to be greater than is there stated.
The defendants submitted to the court a prayer for a ruling
that the statement of the sheriff, in his return, of the quantity
of ice actually taken by him on the writ of replevin, was competent and conclusive evidence of that quantity, in the trial of
the suit on the replevin bond. The bill of exceptions states
that the cQurt overruled such prayer, and ruled that neither
one of the returns was conclusive evidence of the quantity
taken by the officer upon the replevin writ, and that the defendants excepted to such rulings. INo practical question ariges
upon this exception, for it does not appear by the bill of exceptions that either side offered any evidence for the purpose of
showing that the quantity of ice replevied varned from the
quantity stated in the amended return. The evidence offered
to be given by the defendants to prove that the value of the
ice replevied was less than $10,000 at whatever time such value

was to be assessed, was not an offer to prove that the quantity
of ice replevied varied from that stated in the amended return;
and the plaintiff, neither offering nor giving any evidence that
such quantity varied from that stated in the amended return,
relied upon the finding of th6 jury in the replevin suit as to
the value of the ice replevied.
The defendants complain of the admission in evidence of
the answer of the jury in the replevin suit as to the value of
the ice replevied, where it was situated, at the time it was
taken, and also of the ruling of the court that such answer
was evidence in this suit, and- conclusive against the defendants, of the value of the ice, in determining the amount ivhich
the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this suit. It is contended
for the defendants, that it was discretionary in the jury, in the,
trial of the replevin suit, to answer the question referred to,
and that it was no part of the legal issue in that trial. But,
as has been shown, the rule adopted in that trial, for finding
the damages, was to assess the interest on what was found to
have been the value of the ice at the time and place of taking,
and that such value was-an indispensable element in arriving
at a verdict. Such value was found by the jury, in finding
the verdict, and, a judgment having been entered thereon, the
fact so found is conclusive, not only upon the parties to the
replevin suit, but upon those-who became sureties by the bond,
"to abide its event. The sureties became bound by the resfilt
of the replevin suit by virtue of their agreement contained in
the bond.
In Drummond v. Fzm of .PreatiM, 12 Wheat. 515, the
record of a judgment confessed by a principal to a creditor for
a debt due was held to be admissible in evidence to charge a
surety who had guaranteed the debt to the creditor. In
StovdZ v. BaTn, 10 Wall. 583, it was held that the sureties in
the bond of an administrator were bound by a decree against
the administrator, made in a suit to which they were not parties, finding assets in his hands which he had not paid over.
The sureties in the replevin bond were represented in. the
replevin suit by the plaintiff therein, and were identified with
it in interest, and claimed in privity with it, so as to be con-

eluded by the proceedings in that suit. 1 Greenl. Ev. § 523.
The question of the value of the ice at the time it was taken
in replevm was essential to the finding of the verdict in the
replevin suit; and in such case, it is-not necessary to the conclusiveness of the former judgment that there should have
been a formal issue in the prior suit as to such question. 1

Argued February 3, 6,1888.-Decded April 9,1883.

A patent granted in 1871, for an improvement in post-office boxes was reIssued in 1872, and again in 1877, and again in 1879. The original patent
limited the invention to a metallic frontage made contInuo-is by connecting the adjoining frames to each other, and not merely to the woodwork.
There was no mistake, and the original patent was not defective or insufficient, in either the descriptive portion or the claims. In the progress
of the first reissue through the Patent Office, the applicant, on its requirement, struck out of the proposed specification everything which suggested
any other mode of fastening than one bywhichthe frames were to befastened to each other: He7d, that the flrst reissue could not have been construed as claiming any other mode of fastening; that therefore the third
reissue could not be construed as clauning any other mode of fastening;
and that, as the defendant's structures would not have infrnged any
claim of the original patent, they could not be held to Infringe any claim
of the third reissue.
