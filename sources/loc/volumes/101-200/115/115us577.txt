-. r. IF. B. Corngton for plaintiff in error.

.Afr. Jacob P. E'ffinger in person.
JusTicE FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.
The writ of error brought by the trustee raises no Federal

was or was not executed with reference to Confederate notes
is a question of fact for the State court, and not one of law
for this court.
