curved body and rounded corners. Smith has it in his shape.
But, in view of the state of the art, and the terms of his
patent, the plaintiff must be confined to a curved body, rounded
corners and oblique arms, or, at least, to a shape which, for
practical use, in subsequent manipulation, has a disposition of
metal, which causes a sharp corner to be formed in substantially the same way as by the use of his blank. The defendants' blank does not have such a shape.

WOLLENSAK v. REIhER.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
Argued April 14, 15, 1885.-Decided May 4, 1885.

In view of the state of the art existing at the date of the patent granted to
John F. Wollensak for an improvement in transom lifters by original patent No. 136,801, dated March 11, 1873, and by reissued patent No. 9,307,
dated July 20, 1880, and the claims of that patent, it must be limited to a
combination, with a transom, its lifting arm and operating.rod, of a guide
for the upper end of the operating rod, prolonged beyond the junction with
the lifting arm, so as to prevent the operating-rod from being bent or displaced by the weight of the transom; and it is not infringed by the device
secured to Frank A. Reiher by patent No. 226,353, dated April 6, 1880.

This was a bill in equity to restrain infringements of a patent. The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Opinion of the Court.

136,801, dated March 11, 1873, having been issued to John F.
Wollensak, the appellant, for an alleged new and useful improvement in transom-lifters. This appeal is from a decree
dismissing the bill for want of equity.
The specification and drawings of the patent are as follows:
"Figure 1 is a perspective view, showing one means for carrying my invention into operation. Fig. 2 is a side elevation
of the same, and Fig. 3 is a detached sectional view.
"Similar letters of reference in the several figures denote
the same parts.
"Transom-lifters have heretofore been constructed with a
long upright rod or handle jointed at its upper end to a lifting-

.11
, ,

arm which extends to and is connected with the side or edge of
the transom-sash, the sash being opened or closed by a vertical movement of the long rod. When thus constructed the
upright rod is liable to be bent by the weight of the trangom,

WOLLENSAK v. REItHER.
Opinion of the Court.

owing to the want of support at or near the point of junction
between the long rod and the lifting-arm.
"The object of my invention is to remedy this difficulty;
and to such end it consists in providing the proper support, or
support and guide, for the upper end of the lifting-rod during
its vertical movements and while at rest.
"This may be accomplished in a variety of ways, one of
which I will now proceed to describe in detail, although I wish
it clearly understood that I do not limit my invention to this
construction, but regard it as covering broadly any construction, combination or arrangement of parts which shall support
the long or operating rod and prevent it from being bent or
displaced by the weight of the transom.
"In the drawings, _D is the door; T, the transom-sash,
pivoted at top, bottom, or middle, as preferred; A, the liftingarm that connects the sash to the upright rod, passing through
two guides, G G', one above and one below the point of junction with the lifting-arm; R, a friction roller secured to the
lifting-rod so as to bear against the wall and support said rod
at its point of junction with the lifting-arm; n n,, notches cut
in the upright rod to receive the end of the set-screw; and s, a
set-screw arranged, in connection with the lower guide and the
rod , so as to be convenient of operation for the purpose of
fixing the transom at any required angle. The upright rod is
thus supported at three points, to wit, above, below, and at the
point where it sustains the weight of the transom. It can also
be adjusted and securely fastened so as to open the sash as
much or as little as may be desired, and to lock it in that position.
"Having thus described my invention, what I claim as
new is-

"1. The combination, with a transom, its lifting-arm and
operating-rod of a guide for the upper end of the operatingrod, to prevent it from being bent or displaced by the weight
of the transom.
"2. The roller R7, arranged at the junction of the lifting-arm
A and upright rod U, in a transom-lifter, substantially as and
for the purpose described.

Opinion of the Court.

"3. The guide G', arranged above the junction of the liftingarm and upright rod, in combination with the prolonged rod
U, the guide G,and arm A, substantially as and for the purpose specified."
The defences relied on were, that the alleged invention was
not patentable; that it had been anticipated by Bayley and

M]C[luskey, to whom a patent had been granted, dated July It,
1868, o. 79,511, for an improvement in railroad-car ventilators; and that the defendant's device, secured to him by a
patent dated April 6, 1880, No. 226,353, did not infringe that
of the appellant.

Opinion of the Court.

The specification and drawings of the appellee's patent are

"My object is to construct a lifter which will always be
ready for use and answer equally well for all kinds of transoms,
no matter how the same may be hinged, without exchanging.
or altering any of the parts, in a simple and durable manner.

and Fig. 10 an inverted plan, of the casing.

Figs. 11 and 12

show the top of lifting-rod with adjusting-block. Fig. 13 shows
the lower part of the lifting-rod with handle attachment.
" Like letters of reference indicate like parts.'
"The casing A, which is screwed to the door-frame, is provided on the front plate with a long slot, a. Sliding loosely
up and down in this casing, A, is the adjusting-block B, which
protrudes by the ear b, forming part of this block, through
slot a. Affixed to block B is the lifting-rod C, in such a manner as to allow the rod to turn in said block. For this purpose
the block is provided with a wide slot, as shown in Figs. 9
and 12, into which fits loosely the pin d, which penetrates the
rod C.
"Attached to the transom in a position which is regulated
by and depends upon the manner of hinging the same, at
about midway between the outer swinging point and the
centre of hinge, is the bracket or loop D. Attached to this
loop is the connecting link or arm E, which connects at its
other end to the ear b of the adjusting-block.
"A look at the drawings will show that the upward or
downward movement of the adjusting-block, caused by the
respective movement of the lifting-rod, will be followed by a
swinging movement of the transom on its hinges, through the
agency of the universal link or arm .
"The inner face of the casing A (shown in Fig. 9) is provided
with a series of notches, e. The upper end of the rod C is provided with a spiral spring, F, which, resting at one end in the
holef of the adjusting-block B, is affixed at its other end in a
groovef', at the, top of rod C. This spring Fhas the tendency
to hold the rod C, which turns loosely in the block B, in such
a position as to cause the pin d, which projects on both sides of
the block B, to fall into one of the notches e provided in the
casing. Thus the rod, with block B and universal link E, is
held in place by the action of spring F and pin d, and can be
moved only by turning the rod C slightly on its axis, so as to
disengage the pin d from the notch e.
"It will be seen, that, whenever the hand of the operator

WOLLENSAK v. REIHER.
Opinion of the Court.

should happen to loose its hold upon the rod, the spring F wil
cause the pin d to fall into the next notch and arrest the
further movement of the block B, and thereby the movement
of the transom. The transom may thus be locked at any
desired position.
"The rod 0 is provided at its lower end with handle I, arranged with an opening for the finger, so that the rod may be
with convenience turned and lifted or lowered at will.
"For transoms hinged at the lower edge of the frame (shown
in Figs. 1 and 2) the transom with loop _D hangs in the universal link E. The casing A with adjusting-block is affixed
above. When operating the same the block bears with its
shoulders A upon the inner face of casing A.
"For transoms hinged at the upper frame, as shown in Figs.
3 and 4, the casing is fastened below, so that the adjustingblock may be held by the lowest notch e. While the transom
is closed the universal link hangs downward from the loop A.
In this case, when operated, the bearing between block and
casing is reversed, and is taken up by a pin, g, penetrating
through the ear of the block and resting upon the outer face of
the casing A.
"For oblique transoms the lifter is affixed as shown in Fig. 5.
Fig. 6 shows a transom hinged at the side. The casing of
lifter is affixed vertically at the hinged side, the adjusting
block being in the highest notch when the transom is closed.
"For transoms hinged in the middle the lifter may be affixed
either above or below the hinged centre. For skylights the
lifter is affixed as shown in Fig. 7.

"It will be seen that the universal link F, with its two
swivelling loop ends, will always be ready to form a connection
between the transom-loop 1? and the ear b of the adjustingblock, no matter which way the transom may be hinged.
"What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is"1. The casing A, with slot a, containing the adjusting-block
B, with upright rod a, in combination with chain-link F and
loop D, all arranged and constructed in the manner as shown,
and for the purpose specified.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

"2. The adjusting-block B, rod , pin d, and spring F, in
combination with casing A, provided with slot a and notches
e e,for the purpose set forth."
The specification of the complainant's patent undertakes
broadly to describe the invention, intended to be embraced in
it, as "any construction, combination or arrangement of parts
which shall support the long or operating rod and prevent it
from being bent or displaced by the weight of the transom."
But, having reference to the state of the art at the date of the
alleged invention, and the claims of the patent, the patentee
must be limited to the combination, with a transom, its liftingarm and operating-rod, of a guide for the upper end of
the operating-rod, prolonged beyond the junction with the lifting-arm so as t, prevent the operating-rod from being bent or
displaced by the weight of the transom.
Putting by the question whether this is a patentable invention in view of the existing state of the art, the claim must be
regarded as a narow one, and limited to the particular combination described. In that view, the defendant's arrangement
is no infringement. The difference between the two devices is
pointed out, and, as we think, satisfactorily, by Mr. Dayton, an
expert witness on behalf of the defendant. He says: "When
the sash is opened in the Reiher transom not an ounce of its
weight falls upon, either laterally or obliquely, the upright rod.
The Reiher transom is provided at its lower end with a block
which runs in a guide, and which is so constructed, with inner
flanges and an external pin, arranged to bear respectively upon
the inner and outer faces of the slotted guide which he employs,
and which is fixed on the frame, as to receive all the pressure
resulting from the weight of the transom. The handle or the
long upright rod in the said Reiher transom is designed and
serves wholly as a means of reaching the foot of the lifting-arm
and pushing it upward or drawing it downward. As I before
stated, not a particle of inward or lateral pressure falls upon
the end of this rod by reason of the weight of the transom. In
my judgment, such upright rod may, for this purpose, as well
be absent as present. I stated that the sole purpose of the long
upright rod was to reach and lift the foot of the block with the

WOLLENSAK v. REIHER.
Opinion of the Court.

end of the lifting-rod. To be accurate, I also state .that it
serves, additionally, to operate a novel locking device with
which said foot-piece of the lifting-arm is provided.
"So far, then, as the function of the guide 4' in the Wollensak
patent, or the upper guide in the numbers 1 and 3 of the Wollensak transom model, is concerned, I find that the Reiher
transom presents a totally different structure, operating on a
totally different principle, from that exhibited in the Wollensak
transom model.
"In my judgment the improvements of Mr. Reiher, as exemplified in the Reiher transom exhibit, are based upon and
proceed from a totally different point in the state of the art of
transom-lifters, from that admitted to be old in the passage
quoted from Wollensak's patent specifications, and upon which
Wollensak's improvements are based. It is a matter of common knowledge, I believe, and it is certainly within my personal
knowledge, that transoms or flap windows were, long prior to
the date of Wollensak's original patent, provided with a pivoted
brace, the foot of which was movable against the frame of
such window or door. This is precisely the point in the art to
which Mr. Reiher in his transom-lifter has applied his improvements. His improvements do not involve the removal of the
weight of the transom from a direct bearing against the frame
at the foot of the lifting-arm, and have not that object. Mr.
Reiher sought, evidently, only to provide a ready locking device by which the foot of the lifting-arm may be secured at any
point quickly, and by which he may at once reach the locking
device and lift the transom, through the medium of the long
upright rod. Said long upright rod in his case is not, therefore, made stronger or weaker with a view to prevent its bending, and is only strong enough in any case to enable him to
push up the foot of the lifting-arm, and, by rotating the rod, to
unlock his novel fastening device. There was no fault in the.
old structure upon which Mr. IReiher has made his improvements like that assigned to the old device upon which Wollensak has improved, namely, the bending of the vertical rod
having a lifting-rod connected therewith, because said liftingarm did not, in the old device attacked by Reiher, have any

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion df the Court.

vertical rod at all, and because the lifting-arm distinctly bore
against the frame instead of against the rod."
It follows, that the decree of the Circuit Court, dismissing
the bill for want of equity, was correct. It is accordingly ,

Afflrmed.

WOLLENSAK v. REIER.
APPEAL FROM THE CIROUIT COURT OF THE IThTED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
Argued April 14, 15, 1885.-Decided May 4, 1885.
The question whether delay in applying for a reissue of a patent has been
reasonable or unreasonable is a question of law for the determination of the
court.
The action of the Patent Office, in granting a reissue, and deciding that from
special circumstances shown, it appeared that the applicant had not been
guilty of laches in applying for it, is not sufficient to explain a delay in the
application which otherwise appears unreasonable, and to constitute laches.
When a reissue expands the claims of the original patent, and it appears that
there was a delay of two years, or more, in applying for it, the delay invalidates the reissue, unless accounted for and shown to be reasonable.
A bill in equity which sets forth the issue of a patent, and a reissue with expanded claims after a lapse of two or more years, and states no sufficient
explanation of the cause of the delay, presents a question of laches which
may be availed of as a defence, upon general demurrer for want of equity.

The facts which make the case are stated in the opinion of
the court.

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill in equity to restrain by injunction the alleged
infringement by the defendant below of reissued letters patent

WOLLENSAK v. REIHER.
Opinion of the Court.

No. 10,264, issued to the complainant December 26, 1882, upon
the surrender of original letters patent No. 148,538, dated
March 10, 1874, granted to the complainant for a new and useful improvement in transom lifters. There was exhibited with
the bill, as parts thereof, copies of the original and reissued
letters patent. The defendant demurred to the bill for want
of equity, the demurrer was sustained, and the bill dismissed.
From that decree this appeal was taken.
The original patent was confined to two claims, which are
also the first two in the reissued patent. The latter, which, in
its specification and drawings, is substantially the same with
the original, adds seven additional claims, making nine in all.
Of these, the bill alleges infringement as to the third, fourth,
fifth, sixth and ninth.
The bill, after averring the issue of the original patent, and
referring to the copy set out as an exhibit, contains the following averments:
"That said letters patent, being afterwards found to be in
operative or invalid by reason of an insufficient or defective
specification, which insufficiency or defect had arisen through
inadvertence, accident or mistake, and without any fraudulent
or deceptive intention on the part of your orator, were afterwards surrendered and duly cancelled by the Commissioner of
Patents: that thereupon, and upon due application therefor,
reissued letters patent of the United States, No. 10,264, were
issued to your orator, dated the 26th day of December, 1882,
granting to him, his heirs or assigns, for the term of seventeen
years from the said 10th day of March, 1874, the full and exclusive right of making, using, and vending to others to be used,
the said invention, as by reference to said reissued letters patent
here in court to be produced, and a copy; of the specification
and drawings of :which is hereto attached, will more fully
appear; that said reissued letters patent were applied for in
good faith and not for any fraudulent or improper purpose;
that, as your orator verily believes, no other person, firm, or
corporation, not acting under his authority, ever began the
manufacture, sale, or use of transom lifters containing or embodying said inventions or improvements until long after your.

orator had consulted counsel and taken steps towards applying
for said reissue, and until long after your orator had applied
for and obtained a reissue of his previous patent on transom
lifters, having broader claims than any now contained in said
reissue No. 10,264, that, in making said application for said lastmentioned reissue, your orator presented to the Patent Office
a full, sworn statement of facts and circumstances connected
with his applying for and obtaining said original patent No.
148,538, and with his delay in applying for said reissue; that
at the first, said reissue application was rejected, on the ground
that such statement did not show or furnish any sufficient explanation or excuse for said delay, and that your orator had
lost his rights to such a reissue by reason thereof, the examiner
citing Jillerv. Bra"8 Company, 104 U. S.350, and other cases;
that, on appeal, said decision or rejection was reversed by the
examiners-in-chief constituting the Patent Office Board of Appeal; that, in a long and full opinion, said examiners-in-chief
expressly held that your orator had sufficiently and satisfactorily
explained said delay and was still entitled to such a reissue,
and that a part of said opinion, referring to claims appearing
in said reissue, and now in controversy, was as follows:
"'All the above claims, moreover, have been rejected upon
a supposed legal bar to enlargement of claim, found in certain
recent decisions of the courts, mainly of the Supreme Court of
the United States, on which the other decisions cited are based.
*

*

.We

find, upon review, that there was a grave defect

in applicant's patent and claims, whereby it was inoperative to
protect the invention disclosed by him, to the full extent to
which he was entitled.

.

.

.

We do not find any evidence

of such laches or delay, after ascertaining the defects of his
patent, as to debar 6r estop him from the benefits of the statute.
We do not find in his renewed application any attempt to enlarge the scope of his invention beyond what was originally
disclosed, but, on the contrary, an attempt to secure protection
for the invention contained in the patent."'
For the purpose of deciding the question of law, arising on
the demurrer to the bill, it is not necessary to set out the
several claims-in the original and reissued patents, with a view

WOLLENSAK v. REIHER.
Opinion of the Court.

to a comparison. It is sufficient to say, that it is not claimed
that the defendant is guilty of an infringement of either of the
claims in the original patent as repeated in the reissue; and it
is admitted that the claims in the reissued patent, infringement
of which is averred, are expansions of the original claims, not
covered by them, but alleged, nevertheless, to be embraced
within the invention as described in the original patent. This
is to say, that if, as a matter of fact, the patentee was the first
and original inventor of the parts and combinations covered by
these claims, the language of the specification to the original
patent would sufficiently embrace them.
It follows from this, that if, at the date of the issue of the
original patent, the patentee had been consqious of the nature
and extent of his invention, an inspection of the patent, when
issued, and an examination of its terms, made with that reasonable degree of care which is habitual to and expected of men,
in the management of their own interests, in the ordinary
affairs of life, would have immediately informed him that the
patent had failed fully to cover the area of his invention. And
this must be deemed to be notice to him of the fact, for the law
imputes knowledge when opportunity and interest, combined
with reasonable care, would necessarily impart it.
Not to improve such opportunity, under the stimulus of selfinterest, with reasonable diligence, constitutes laches which in
equity disables the party, who seeks to revive a right which he
has allowed to lie unclaimed, from enforcing it to the detriment
of those who have, in consequence, been led to act as though
it were abandoned.
This general doctrine of equity was applied with great distinctness to the correction of alleged mistakes in patents, by
reissues, in the case of -Miller v. Bra.s Company, 104 U. S.
350. It was there declared, that where the mistake suggested
was merely that the claim was not as broad as it might have
been, it was apparent upon the first inspection of the patent,
and, if any correction was desired, it should have been applied
for immediately; that the granting of a reissue for such a purpose, after an unreasonable delay, is clearly an abuse of the
power to grant reissues, and may justly be declared illegal and

OCTOBEtR TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Cour&

void; that, in reference to reissues made for the purpose of
enlarging the scope of the patent, the rule of laches should be
strictly applied, and no one should be relieved who has slept
upon his rights, and has thus led the public to rely on the
implied disclaimer involved in the terms of the original patent;
and that When this is a matter apparent on the face of the
instrument, upon a mere comparison of the original patent with
the reissue, it is competent for the courts to decide whether the
delay was unreasonable and whether the reissue was, therefore,
contrary to law and void.
This doctrine has been reiterated in many cases since, and at
the present term has been reconsidered and emphatically
repeated as the settled law, in the case of .fan v. Harwood,
112 U. S. 351, where it is said, by Mr. Justice Bradley, delivering the opinion of the court: "We repeat then, if a patentee
has not claimed as much as he is entitled to claim, he is bound
to discover the defect in a reasonable time, or he loses all right
to a reissue; and if the Commissioner of Patents, after the
lapse of such reasonable time, undertakes to grant a reissue for
the purpose of correcting the supposed mistake, he exceeds his
power, and acts under a mistaken view of the law; and the
court, seeing this, has a right, and it is its duty, to declare the
reissuepro tanto void, in any suit founded upon it." It was
also there said, that, while no invariable rule can be laid down
as to what is reasonable time within which the patentee should
seek for the correction of a claim which he considers too
narrow, a delay of two years, by analogy to the law of public
use before an application for a patent, should be construed
equally favorable to the public, and that excuse for any longer
delay than that should be made manifest by the special circumstances of the case.
In the present case the delay in applying for the reissue was
more than five years. No special circumstances to account for
or excuse the delay are set out in the bill. In lieu of such a
statement, the complainant avers that he presented to the Patent Office a full, sworn statement of facts and circumstances
connected with his applying for and obtaining his original patent, and with his delay in applying for the reissue, and that

WOLLENSAK v. REIHER.
Opinion of the Court.

the examiners-in-chief decided that he had sufficiently and
satisfactorily explained the delay, and was entitled to the reissue. But this does not satisfy the law. The question as to
whether the delay had been reasonable or unreasonable is for
the court to determine, upon the special circumstances brought
to it9 attention; and it cannot substitute the decision of the
Patent Office upon that question for its own. The very question is, whether the Patent Office has decided rightly, and, as
it is a question of power and jurisdiction, in which the delay
shown is prinuafacie unlawful, it is incumbent on the party
seekin' to establish the jurisdiction of the Patent Office to
grant the reissue, to show the facts on which it rests. In every
case of a reissue, that office, either expressly or implicitly decides
the question of diligence on the part of the patentee; and the
grant of a reissue is a decision that the delay has not been unreasonable. That, therefore, is the very question for judicial
review, in every suit to enforce a reissued patent, in which the
question is made; and, as we have seen, the settled rule of decision is, that if it appears, in cases where the claim is merely
expanded, that the delay has been for two years, or more, it is
adjudged to invalidate the reissue, unless the delay is accounted
for and excused by special circumstances, which show it to
have been not unreasonable.
When, therefore, the injunction bill sets out or exhibits both
the original and the reissued patent, and it appears from inspection that the sole object of the reissue was to enlarge and
expand the claims of the original, and that a delay of two or
more years has taken place in applying for the reissue, not explained by special circumstances showing it to be reasonable,
the question of laches is a question of law arising on the face
of the bill, which avails as a defence, upon a general demurrer
for want of equity.
This rule of equity pleading applies in analogous cases; as
where, it otherwise appearing on the face of the bill that the
claim is stale, or is barred by lapse of time, and it is sought to
avoid the effect of such a bar, on the ground that the fraud
complained of was concealed, and has been only recently discovered, it is necessary that "the particular acts of fraud or

concealment should have been set forth by distinct averments,
as well as the time when discovered, so that the court may see
whether, by the exercise of ordinary diligence, the discovery
might not have been before made." Beaubiem v. Beaublen, 23

GEORGE W. FRASHER & Others v. O'CONNOR.
IN ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
Argued April 10, 1885.-Decided May 4, 1885.
In adjusting Congressional grants of lands to a State, the only questions
for consideration by the officers of the United States are, whether the State
possessed the right to claim the land under the grant, and whether the land
was subject to selection by its agents. Those officers have no jurisdiction
to review transactions between the State and its purchasers, nor between
the State and its locating agents, and determine whether such purchasers or
locating agents complied with the provisions of its laws relating to the sale
of the lands.
Surveys under the eighth section of the act of July 23, 1866, "to quiet land
titles in California," become operative by approval of the United States
Surveyor General for the State, and his filing in the local land office of
the township plats. Upon such approval of a survey and filing of the
township plats, lands thereby excluded from a confirmed private land claim
become subject to State selections and other modes of disposal of public
lands. Previous approval of the survey by the Commissioner of the General Land Office is not necessary.
Lists of Lands certified to the State by the Commissioner of the General
Land Office, and the Secretary of the Interior, convey as complete a
title as patents ; and lands embraced therein are not thereafter open to
settlement and pre-emption.
