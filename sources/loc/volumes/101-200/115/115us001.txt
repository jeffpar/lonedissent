TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.
Argued November 20, 21, 1884.-Decided May 4, 1885.

Corporations of the United States, created by and organized under acts of
Congress, are entitled, under the Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, to
remove into the Circuit Courts of the United States suits brought against
them in State courts on the ground that such suits are suits "arising under
the laws of the United States."
The Union Pacific Railway Company is, as to its road, property and franchises
in Kansas, a corporation defacto created and organized under acts of Congress ; and as to the same in Nebraska, it is strictly and purely a corporation deriving all its corporate and other powers from acts of Congress
The Texas & Pacific Railway Company is also a corporation, deriving its
corporate powers from acts of Congress.
These companies are entitled, under the Act of March 3, 1875, to have all suits
brought against them in State courts removed to Circuit Courts of the
United States, on the ground that they are suits arising under the laws of
the United States.
An objection that a petition for removal was not verified by oath, or that there
was delay in filing it, may be waived by delay in taking the objection.
In Kansas, a proceeding before a Mayor of a city and a jury to take land for
widening a street, and to ascertain the value of the land taken, and to assess the cost thereof on the property benefited, is not, while pending there,
a suit at law within the meaning of the Act of March 3, 1875, authorizing
the removal of causes; but it becomes such a suit at law when transferred to
the Circuit Court of the State on appeal.
In proceedings, under the Act of the Legislature of Kansas, passed in 1875, for
widening the streets of Kansas City, the Union Pacific Railway Company
had a controversy distinct and separate from like controversies of other
owners of land, affected by the proceedings: and the fact that the removal
of the controversy of the Railway Company to the Circuit Court of the
United States may have an indirect effect upon the proceedings in the State
courts as to the other owners, furnishes no good reason for depriving the
Company of its right to remove its suit.

The questions argued and decided in these cases arose under
the statutes regulating the removal of causes from State courts.
The facts in regard to each case are stated in the opinion of
the court.

N. JUSTicE BiR&DLEY delivered the opinion of the court.
The principal question involved in these cases is whether a
suit brought in a State court against a corporation of the
United States may be removed by such corporation into the
Circuit Court of the United States, on the ground of its being
a corporation organized under a law of the United States.
The plaintiff in error in four of the cases is the Union Pacific
Railway Company, and in the other three cases is the Texas
& Pacific Railway Company. They contend that they bave
such a right of removal, either under the removal act of July
27, 1868, 15 Stat. 227, now forming ยง 640 of Revised Statutes;
or under the act of March 3, 1875, entitled "An Act to determine the jurisdiction of Circuit Courts of the United States,
and to regulate the removal of causes from State courts, and
for other purposes," 18 Stat. 470; or both. Whether the corporations of the United States, organized under acts of Congress,
have or have not this right of removal is the principal question
in these cases.
The suits were all brought in State courts against the said
corporations severally. In the first case, Myers, a switchman
at Armstrong, in Kansas, in the employ of the Union Pacific
Railway Company, sued the company for an injury alleged to

Opinion of the Court.

have been sustained by him through the carelessness of the
company or its agents, in the construction of the coupling of
its cars. The company filed an answer, and at the same time
a petition for the removal of the cause to the Circuit Court of
the United States for the District of Kansas, and the proper
bond required by the law. The petition for removal stated
that the petitioner was a corporation other than a banking
corporation, and organized under a law of the United States,
namely, an act of Congress entitled "An Act to aid in the
construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri
River to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the government
the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes,"
approved July 1st, 1862; and that, in accordance with said act
and the acts amendatory and supplemental thereto, the petitioner had exercised and did exercise its corporate functions
and powers.
The petition then proceeded as follows:
"That February 1st, 1880, pursuant to sec. 16 of the said act
of July 1, 1862, and of the act of July 2d, 186k, the Kansas
Pacific Railway Company, a corporation created by the Territorial Legislature of Kansas, and organized under the laws of
said Territory, and the Denver Pacific Railway & Telegraph
Company, a corporation created and organized under the laws
of the Territory of Colorado, both of which said companies are
mentioned in said acts of Congress and their said railroads by
said acts made a part of the Union Pacific Railroad system,
were, by agreement, consolidated with the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Your petitioner and said consolidated company, by agreement, as by said acts authorized, assumed and
adopted the name of The Union Pacific Railway Company,
which company, consolidated, assumed, took, and from thenceforth had and has, by virtue of said agreement of consolidation,
possession and ownership of all the railroads and other property, real and personal, of said constituent companies, and has
and does operate and manage the same under and by authority
of said acts of Congress, and is governed and controlled by said
acts, and is to all intents and purposes and in fact a corporation
under the laws of the United States.

PACIFIC RAILROAD REMOVAL CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

That.the plaintiff, Abram Myers, has sued your petitioner,
the Union Pacific Railway Company, process in this suit having been served on its agents, and your petitioner has appeared
thereto and filed its answer; that the matter and amount in
this suit above entitled exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or
value of five hundred dollars; that your petitioner has a defence
to said action arising under and by virtue of the aforesaid laws
of the United States; that said suit has not been tried, nor has
it been ready or stood for trial, and the present is the first
term of the court at which it could have been tried."
The petition concluded with the proffer of the proper bond,
and a prayer for an order of removal, and that the court would
proceed no further in the cause. The bond was approved and
an order of removal was made. On filing the record in the
Circuit Court of the United States, a motion was made to remand the cause to the *Statecourt, and it was remanded accordingly, the circuit judge holding that the suit was not one
arising "under the Constitution and laws of the United States,"
within the meaning of the act of Congress of March 3, 1875,
and that a suit cannot be removed from a State to a federal
court upon the sole ground that it is a suit by or against a corporation organized under' the laws of the United States. To
the judgment remanding the cause, the writ of error was sued
out in this court.
The next case, Union PacidieRailway Company v. The City
qf iansa.q, was a proceeding instituted by the common council
of said city by ordinance passed in April, 1880, for widening a
street through the depot grounds of the company, and thereby
taking a portion of its said grounds and the property of many
other persons. A jury was summoned in November, 1880, before the mayor, to inquire and find- the value of the property
taken for the street, and to assess the amount upon surrounding property benefited thereby. On December 12, 1880, this
jury found the value of the company's property taken equal to
$7,305, and assessed, as benefits, upon the remaining property
of the company the sum of $12,325 towards paying the damages for widening the street. The verdict was confirmed by
the mayor and common council, February 25, 1881. The laws

of Missouri give to any party, dissatisfied with the award of
the jury in such cases, an appeal to the Circuit Court of Jackson County (in which Kansas City is situated), and the Union
Pacific Railway Company, and some other dissatisfied parties,
filed separate appeals, and the proceedings were certified to the
said court, where the said appeals were by the law directed to
be tried "in all respects, and subject to the same rules and the
same law, as other trials had in the Circuit Court, and the same
record thereof made and kept." After the case was certified
to the Circuit Court of Jackson County, the company in due
time, April, 1881, filed a petition for removal of the case to the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of
Missouri. The petition, as in the case of Myers, set out the
incorporation of the company, and the consolidation of the
three companies before mentioned under the acts of Congress
before referred to, by the name of The Union Pacific Railway
Company. The petition then proceeds to state as follows:
"And your petitioner, by agreement of said constituent
companies, succeeded to, had, and possessed all the rights and
privileges and property, real and personal, which was of said
constituent companies, or either of them, and that at the time
of commencement of this proceeding your petitioner had
owned and possessed, exclusive of all other rights and claims,
the tract of land described in said proceeding, as follows:" (it
then describes the land of the company taken for the street,
and then states as follows:) "and that the same had been acquired by the Kansas Pacific Railway Company for depot and
other railway purposes by authority of law, and that your peti.
tioner held said land for said purposes, and was occupying the
same in part for such purposes at the time of the commencement of the proceedings, -and was about to appropriate the
residue thereof to such use, the increase of business of your
petitioner making it imperatively necessary that it should be
so occupied.
"Your petitioner distinctly avers that it is a corporation, not
banking, organized under the laws of the United States; that
it holds and possesses said property pursuant to such laws; that
it has a defence in this action arising under and by virtue of

PACIFIC RAILROAD REMOVAL CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

the laws of the United States hereinbefore referred to; and
your petitioner desires that said cause may be removed into
said Circuit Court of the United States for trial pursuant to
section 640 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. Your
petitioner further states that the matter in dispute in this
cause, in which your petitioner is interested, exceeds the sum
of five hundred dollars, exclusive of costs; and further, that
this suit has not been tried, but is now pending for trial on appeal in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri."
The petition concluded with the ordinary proffer of a bond
and prayer for removal of the case, &c., and an order of removal was made by the State court. Motion was then made
to the Circuit Court of the United States to remand the cause,
and that court, after holding the motion under consideration
for some time, gave judgment to remand, which judgment is
brought here by writ of error.
Before rendering judgment, the Circuit Court of the United
States allowed the company to file an additional statement of
facts for the purpose of showing that the cause was removable,
averring its acceptance of the acts of Congress, and the passage
of an act by the Legislature of Missouri, authorizing the company to extend its track within the limits of Missouri, and to
acquire depot grounds there, which it did; and the fact that
said grounds are essential to the operations of the company in
carrying out the objects declared in the acts of Congress relating thereto; that the United States loaned its bonds on said
portion of the road and has a lien thereon for their payment.
The third suit, Union Pacftc Railway Company v. Lucia
_Y1-51th, was an action brought by the defendant in error
against the company in the District Court of Dodge County,
Nebraska, in July, 1883, to recover damages for injuries sustained by her at the company's depot at North Bend, between
Omaha and Ogden. A petition for removal of the cause to
the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Nebraska was filed in due time, alleging the incorporation and
organization of the company under and by virtue of.the acts
of Congress of 1862 and 1864, before referred to; that the
matter in dispute exceeds $500 exclusive of costs; that the de-

fendant had a defence to the action arising under and by virtue of the laws of the United States, to wit, the act and amendatory act of Congress above referred to, concluding with the
usual proffer of bond and prayer for removal. The order of
removal was granted, the Circuit Court remanded the cause to
the State co-art, and a writ of error brings the case here. In
this case the place of injury was on the main line of the Union
Pacific Railway Company.
The fourth case is that of Frank H arwood, who brought a
suit against the Union Pacific Railway Company in the District
Court of Davis County, Kansas, in July, 1882, to recover damages for an injury received by him at the company's depot at
Junction City, Kansas, whilst loading hogs in a car. A
petition for removal of the cause was filed in due time, alleging
the organization of the company under the act of Congress of
July 1, 1862, and the amendments thereto, and other acts of
Congress; and that the petitioner had a defence arising under
the laws of the United States, and concluding with tendering
the proper bond, and a prayer for removal. The State court
approved the bond offered, but denied the petition and proceeded with the cause. A verdict being found for plaintiff, the
case was taken to the Supreme Court of Kansas by appeal.
One of the reasons assigned on the appeal was the denial of the
petition to remove the cause. The Supreme Court affirmed
the judgment, and a writ of error to the judgment of that court
brings the case here.
The three cases of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company
were as follows: The first was a suit brought by A. F.
McAlister against the company in the District Court of Harrison County, Texas, in April, 1879, to recover damages for an
injury to the plaintiff whilst a passenger in one of the company's trains. A petition for removal was filed in due time,
alleging that the suit arose under the laws of the United States,
and that the defendant was a corporation organized under and
by virtue of certain acts of Congress of the United States, to
wit an act entitled "An Act to incorporate the Texas Pacific
Railroad Company, and to aid in the Construction of its Road,
and for other Purposes," approved March 3, 1871,16 Stat. 573,

PACIFIC RAILROAD REMOVAL CASES.
Opinion of the CourL

and an act supplementary thereto, approved May 2, 1872, 17
Stat. 59; that the petitioner had a defence to the action arising
under and by virtue of a law of the United States, to wit, said
act of incorporation ; that it was not a banking, but a railroad
corporation authorized to construct, own and maintain a railroad
to and from certain places designated in said acts of Congress;
concluding with a proffer of a bond and a prayer for removal.
The court approved the bond, but refused to remove the cause.
The special exceptions to the petition for removal were two;
first, that it did not show what the defence was, arising under
and by virtue of a law of the United States; secondly, denying
the allegation that the defendant was a corporation created and
existing under and by virtue of acts of Congress of the United
States. Afterwards the defendant filed a plea in abatement,
stating that it had fied in the United States Circuit Court
at Jefferson, Eastern District of Texas, a certified copy of the
record of the pleadings and other papers in the cause, and had
the same entered on the docket of said court, in the fall term
of 1879, and that plaintiff appeared and moved to remand the
cause to the State court, which motion was overruled, and the
Circuit Court of the United States entertained jurisdiction of
the cause; and the plaintiff agreed to a continuance of the cause
in that court to the spring term of 1880; and at the spring term,.
1880, procured the same to be continued, and at the fall term,
1880, appeared before said court and consented to a continuance,
and at the spring term, 1881, again prosecuted his cause in said
court, and continued the same. This plea was excepted to, and
overruled by the State court. Judgment was rendered in favor
of the plaintiff, and an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court
of Texas. That court overruled the error assigned on the refusal of the District Court to remove the cause, on the ground
that the defendant's petition for removal did not set forth the
defence so as to show that it was a defence arising under the
laws of the United States. The court took notice also that the
petition was not sworn to, but as that point was not raised by
the plaintiff's counsel, they did not consider it. The judgment
of the District Court was affirmed; and the case is brought
here by writ of error to the judgment of the Supreme Court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

The second case of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company
was a suit brought by Laura Kirk against the company in the
District Court of the Second Judicial District of Texas, in
March, 1881, to recover damages for the death of her husband,
caused by the company's cars running off the track. The petition for removal was filed in this case similar in all respects
to that in the preceding case. A second petition was filed a
few days later, adding an averment that the defendant had
fixed its domicil and principal business office at Philadelphia,
in the State of Pennsylvania, and was in contemplation of law
a citizen of that State. The prayer of the petition was denied,
the cause went to trial, judgment was rendered for the plaintiff,
an appeal was taken, and the judgment was affirmed by the
Supreme Court of Texas, upon the reasons and authority of the
previous case of lfTcAlister v. The Texas and Pacift Railway
Oompany. The case is now here by writ of error.
The third and last case of the Texas and Pacific Railway
Company was a suit brought by James Murphy against the
company (or rather against one of its constituent companies,
and afterwards, by amendment against the company itself)
in the District Court of Harrison County, Texas, in 1873, to
recover damages for an injury received by the plaintiff in
,getting upon the cars of the company at Jonesville, Texas.
The pleadings were amended from time to time on both sides,
and the cause was continued, until finally an amended original
petition was filed in October, 1878, followed by a petition for
removal filed November 1, 1878. The prayer of the petition
was denied. The case was afterwards tried, and a verdict and
judgment rendered for the plaintiff; and in M ay, 1883, this
judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Texas on appeal. On the question of removal the court followed the decision in the McAlister case above stated. No question was
raised in this case on account of the time at which the petition
for removal was fied. The application for removal was treated
by the court as made under ยง 640 of the Revised Statutes.
With some diversification of details, it will be perceived that
all of these cases depend principally on two questions:
,First, whether the fact that the plaintiffs in error are corpo-

rations of the United States created by act of Congress makes
the suits against them "suits arising under the laws of the
United States," within the meaning of the second section of
the act of M~arch 3, 1875, before referred to, so as to be removable from the State into the federal courts for that cause: and,
Secondly, whether, if not removable on that ground, they
are removable under ยง 640 of the Revised Statutes, upon the
allegation contained in the several petitions of removal, that
the defendant has a defence to the action arising under and by
virtue of a law of the United States, naming, in some cases,
the act of incorporation as the law referred to.
We are of opinion that corporations of the United States,
created by and organized under acts of Congress like the plaintiffs in error in these cases, are entitled as such to remove into
the Circuit Courts of the United States suits brought against
them in the State courts, under and by virtue of the act of
March 3, 1875, on the ground that such suits are suits "arising
under the laws of the United States." We do not propose to
go into a lengthy argument on the subject; we think that the
question has been substantially decided long ago by this court.
The exhaustive argument of Chief Justice Marshall in the case
of Os.,orn v. Bank of tie United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 817-828,
delivered more than sixty years ago, and always acquiesced in,
renders any further discussion unnecessary to show that a suit
by or against a corporation of the United States is a suit arising
under the laws of the United States. That argument was the
basis of the decision on the jurisdictional question in that case.
The precise question, it is true, was as to the power of Congress
to authorize the bank to sue and be sued in the United States
courts. The words of its charter were, that the bank should
be made able and capable in law to "sue and be sued, plead
and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in all State courts having competent jurisdiction, and
in any Circuit Court of the United States." The power to
create such a jurisdiction in the federal courts rested solely on
the truth of the proposition, that a suit by or against the bank
would be a suit arising under the laws of the United States;
for the Constitution confined the judicial power of the United

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

States to these four classes of cases, namely: first, to cases in
law and equity, arising under the Constitution, the laws of the
United States, and treaties made under their authority; secondly, to cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers
and consuls; thirdly, to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; fourthly, to certain controversies depending on the
character of the parties, such as controversies to which the
United States are a party, those between two or more States,
or a State and citizens of another State, or citizens of different
States, or citizens of the same State claiming lands under
grants of different States, or a State or its citizens and foreign
States, citizens or subjects. Now, suits by or against the
United States Bank could not possibly, as such, belong to any
of these classes except the first, namely, cases in law and equity
arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United
States; and the Supreme Court, as well as the distinguished
counsel who argued the Osborn case, so understood it. Unless,
therefore, a case in which the bank was a party was for that
reason a case arising under the laws of the United States, Congress would not have had the power to authorize it to sue and
be sued in the Circuit Court of the United States. And to this
question, to wit, whether such a case was a suit arising under
the laws of the United States, the court directed its principal
attention. But as it was objected that several questions of
general law might arise in a case, besides that which depended
upon an act of Congress, the court first disposed of that objection, holding that, as scarcely any case occurs every part of
which depends on the Constitution, laws or treaties of the
United States, it is sufficient for the purposes of federal jurisdiction if the case necessarily involves a question depending on
such Constitution, laws or treaties. The Chief Justice then
proceeds as follows:
"We think, then, that when a question to which the judicial
power of the Union is extended by the Constitution, forms an
ingredient of the original cause, it is in the power of Congress
to give the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of that cause, although
other questions of fact or law may be involved in it.
"The case of the bank is, we think, a very strong case of

PACfIC RAILROAD REMOVAL CASES.

this description. The charter of incorporation not only creates
it, but gives it every faculty which it possesses. The power to
acquire rights of any description, to transact business of any
description, to make contracts of any description, to sue on
those contracts, is given and measured by its charter, and that
charter is a law of the United States. This being can acquire
no right, make no contract, bring no suit which is not authorized by a law of the United States. It is not only itself the
mere creature of a law, but all its actions and all its rights are
dependent on the same law. Can a being, thus constituted,
have a case which does not arise literally as well as substantially under the law? Take the case of a contract, which is put
as the strongest against the bank.
"When a bank sues, the first question which presents itself,
and which lies at the foundation of the cause, is, has this legal
entity a right to sue? Has it a right to come, not into this
court particularly, but into any court? This depends on
a law of the United States. The next question is, has this
being a right to make this particular contract? If this question be decided in the negative, the cause is determined against
the plaintiff ; and this question, too, depends entirely on a law
of the United States. These are important questions, and they
exist in every possible case . ..
"The question forms an original ingredient in every cause.
Whether it be in fact relied on or not, in the defence, it is still
a part of the cause, and may be relied on. The right of the
plaintiff to sue cannot depend on the defence which the defendant may choose to set up. His right to sue is anterior to that
defence, and must depend on the state of things when the
action is brought. The questions which the case involved,
then, must determine its character, whether those questions be
made in the cause or not." pages 823, 824.
"It is said that a clear distinction exists between theparty
and the ca u8e: that the party may originate under a law with
which the cause has no connection; and that Congress may,
with the same propriety, give a naturalized citizen, who is the
mere creature of law, a right to sue in the courts of the United
States, as give that right to the bank.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

"This distinction is not denied; and if the act of Congress
was a simple act of incorporation, and contained nothing more,
it might be entitled to great consideration. But the act does
not stop with incorporating the bank. It proceeds to bestow
upon the being it has made all the faculties and capacities
which that being possesses. Every act of the bank grows out
of this law, and is tested by it. To use the language of the
Constitution, every act of the bank arises out of this law."
page 827.
If the case of Osborn v. The Bank of the United States, is
to be adhered to as a sound expositi6n of the Constitution,
there is no escape from the conclusion that these suits against
the plaintiffs in error, considering the said plaintiffs as corporations created by and organized under the acts of Congress
referred to in the several petitions for removal in these cases,
were and are suits arising under the laws of the United States.
An examination of those acts of Congress shows that the corporations now before us, not only derive their existence, but
their powers, their functions, their duties, and a large portion
of their resources, from those acts, and, by virtue thereof
sustain important relations to the Government of the United
States.
A question is made in the cases coming from Kansas about
the constitution of the company owning and controlling the
line of railroad running through that State. The allegations
of the petition for removal in the Myers case (and the others
are substantially the same) are: That on February 1, 1880,
pursuant to ยง 16 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1862, and
ยง 16 of the act of July 2, 1864, the Kansas Pacific Railway
Company, a corporation created by the territorial legislature
of Kansas, and organized under the laws of said Territory, and
the Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company, a corporation created and organized under the laws of the Territory
of Colorado, both of which companies are mentioned in the
said acts of Congress, and their roads by said acts made a part
of the Pacific Railroad system, were by agreement consolidated with the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and said consolidated company assumed and adopted the name of The

PACIFIC RAILROAD REMOVAL CASES.
Opinion of the Court.

Union Pacific Railway Company, which assumed, took, and
thenceforth has had, by virtue of said agreement of consolidation, possession and ownership of all the railroads and other
property, real and personal, of said constituent companies; and
has operated and managed the same under and by authority
of said acts of Congress, and is governed and controlled by
said acts, and is to all intents and purposes and in fact a corporation under the laws of the United States. These allegations, if true (and they must be taken to be so on the application for removal), show that the present corporation, the
Union Pacific Railway Company, which is the corporation
sued, and which appears and defends the suits, is a corporation
formed and organized under an act of Congress. Besides, the
legislation of Congress in reference to all the companies so
consolidated, in the acts of 1862 and 1864, and subsequent acts,
all of which is reviewed and commented on in the opinion of this
court in Arlws v. .an. as, 111 U. S. 449, shows that all the
said companies, before the said consolidation, had received
large donations of land, subsidies, powers and privileges from
Congress, and had accepted and were subject to important
duties to the United States Government, and were subject to a
wide control of said government both in the construction and
management of their roads and works; and one of said companies, to wit, the Union Pacific Railroad Company, was originally incorporated and organized under said acts, and was
strictly a corporation of the United States, subject to the acts
of Congress, and having important duties to perform to the
government in the prosecution of its business. The facts that
the last named company is one of the constituen elements of
the consolidated company, and that the entire system of roads
now in its possession and under its charge and control constitutes one of the most comprehensive and important mediums
of inter-State commerce in the country, and that in all its
transactions it is subject to the supervision and control of the
Government of the United States, are sufficient, it seems to us,
to bring the Kansas cases, as well as the other cases, fairly
within the principle of the case of Osborn v. The Bank. The
organization of the company under the consolidation proceed-

ings makes it, at least, a corporation de facto, and the legality
of its constitution as a corporation will not be inquired into
collaterally. It has, as we know, from the case of Ames v.
KYansas, been called in question in a regular way by an information in the nature of a quo warranto,and until that, or some
other case directly assailing the validity of the consolidation,
is decided, the plaintiff in error must be regarded as a corporation organized under and by virtue of the laws of the United
States. And the whole being, capacities, authority and obligations of the company thus consolidated are so based upon,
permeated by and enveloped in the acts of Congress referred
to, that it is impracticable, so far as the operations and transactions of the company are concerned, to disentangle those
qualities and capacities, which have their source and foundation
in these acts, from those which are derived from State or Territorial authority.
With regard to transactions occurring in Nebraska, on the
original line of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, it is not
disputed that the present company derives all its corporate and
other powers from the acts of Congress and is strictly and
purely a United States corporation; and the Texas and Pacific
Railway Company stands in the same predicament and occupies
the same position in Texas, in relation to consolidation with
State organizations, as the Union Pacific does in Kansas, and the
same considerations apply to both. It was originally incorporated by the name of the Texas Pacific Railroad Company by
act of Congress, approved March 3, 1871, 16 Stat. 573, with
power to construct a railroad from Marshall, Texas, to San
Diego on the Pacific Coast, and to purchase, or consolidate with,
any railroad company, chartered by Congressional, State, or
Territorial authority on the same route. Under this act, and
by authority of the Legislature of Texas, a consolidation was
effected with the Southern Pacific Railroad Company and the
Southern Transcontinental Railway Company, corporations of
Texas, and by act of Congress of May 2, 1872, 17 Stat. 59, the
name of the company was changed to the Texas and Pacific
Railway Company. The powers, privileges and advantages
given to the company, by Congress, and the duties imposed

upon it, are specified in the acts referred to. It comes clearly
within the reason and conclusion applied to the Union Pacific
Railway Company.
If we are correct, therefore, in the conclusion to which we
have come, that suits by and*against such corporations are
"suits arising under the laws of the United States," then they
are, in terms, embraced in ยง 2 of the act of March 3, 1875,
and the cases now under consideration were removable to the
respective Circuit Courts of the United States, to which it was
sought to remove them, unless any of them were obnoxious to
some other objection peculiar to the individual cases.
The point suggested by the Supreme Court of Texas in the
case of McAlister, that the petition was not verified by oath,
would not be tenable if it were raised by the defendant in
error, since it was evidently waived by him at the time, having
never been raised or mentioned in any way. The same may
be said of the delay in filing the petition in the case of Murphy. See Ayer8 v. TFatsonz, 113 U. S. 594.
In the Kansas City case, of proceedings for widening a
street running through the depot grounds of the company at
that place, brought here by writ of error to the Circuit Court
of the United States, for the Western District of Missouri, it is
contended by the City of Kansas, the defendant in error, first,
that the consolidated railway company must be regarded as
having the same status as if it were still the Kansas Pacific
Railway Company, a corporation of the State of Kansas;
secondly, that the case had already been tried once before the
Mayor and a jury, and an appeal had been taken to the Circuit Court of Jackson County before the petition for removal
was filed, and, therefore, the application came too late; and,
thirdly, that the proceeding was not a separate one against
the railway company, but a joint one against that company
and many other persons, and the appeal of the railway company and other parties carried the whole case to the Circuit
Court of Jackson County to be retried in toto; and a removal
of the case by the railway company to the Circuit Court of the
United States must be a removal of the whole case, and not
merely the case of the railway company, which would cast upon

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

the Federal Court an administrative function in local matters,
for which it was incompetent and destitute of jurisdicton.
The first of these points has already received consideration.
But it may be added, as bearing on this particular case, that
the original Kansas company was authorized by ยง 9 of the
Pacific Railroad act of July 1, 1862, to extend its road into
the State of Missouri-that is, "to construct a railroad and
telegraph line from, the Missouri River, at the mouth of the
Kansas River, on the south side thereof [which is in the State
of Missouri], so as to connect with the Pacific Railroad of Missouri, to the aforesaid point on the one hundredth meridian of
longitude," namely, the point where the Union Pacific was to
commence. This provision looked to the establishment of a
continuous line of railroad from the Mississippi River, at St.
Louis (the eastern terminus of the Pacific Railroad of Missouri), to the Pacific Ocean. The power assumed by Congress
in giving this authority to the 'Kansas company was, undoubtedly, assumed to be within the power "to regulate commerce among the several states;" and, although by an act of
the Legislature of Missouri, passed in February, 1865, the consent of that State was also given to the extension of the road
into its territory, and to its connection with the Missouri road,
the fact remains that the company claimed and assumed to
exercise its powers under the act of Congress, as well as by the
consent of the Legislature of Missouri. So that the right of
appropriating the very property in question in this case was
claimed under authority of an act of Congress. This circumstance adds strength to the claim of the plaintiff in error that
the case was one "arising under the laws of the United
States."
The second ground of objection, that the cause had been
once tried before the mayor by a jury, and an appeal taken,
before a petition for removal was filed, and therefore the application was too late, is answered by the reasoning of this
court in the case of The Boom Conjany v. Patterson, 98 U. S.
403, which was a case very similar in this respect to the present. it was there held that the preliminary proceedings were
in the nature of an inquest to ascertain the value of the prop-

Opinion of the Court.

erty condemned, or sought to be condemned by the right of
eminent domain, and was "not a suit at law in the ordinary
sense of those terms," consequently not a "a suit" within the
meaning of the removal acts; but that "when it was transferred to the District Court by appeal from the award of the
commissioners, it took, under the statute of the State, the form
of a suit at law, and was thenceforth subject to its ordinary
rules and incidents." In that case, "the point in issue on the
appeal was the compensation to be made to the owner of the
land; in other words, the value of the property taken. No
other question was open to contestation in the district court."
The court, therefore, considered the case to be within the rule
laid down in Gaines v. Fuentm, 92 U. S. 10, 20, in which it was
held that a controversy between citizens of different States is
involved in a suit whenever any property or claim of the parties,
capable of pecuniary estimation, is the subject of litigation and
is presented by the pleadings for judicial determination." And,
in this view, the case of Boom Co. v. Patterson was held to be
removable to the federal court. That case, we think, governs
the present, so far, at least, as relates to the trial before the
mayor, which was in its nature an inquest of valuations and
assessments, not having the character of a suit.
A more embarrassing question arises under' the third objection raised by the defendant in error, to wit, that the whole
case relating to the widening of the street was carried before
the Circuit Court of Jackson County by the appeal, and must
also be carried to the Circuit Court of the United States in
the same condition if the application for a removal is sustained, whereby the latter court will be called upon to exercise
administrative functions of a local character to which it is incompetent.
To understand the bearing of this objection, it is necessary
to inquire, first, the condition of the case in the Circuit Court of
Jackson County on the appeal; and, secondly, the rules which
must govern the case on its removal to the federal court, if such
a removal should be effected.
The condition of the case in the Circuit Court of Jackson
County on the appeal depends upon the statute of Missouri

Opinion of the Court.

under which the proceedings were had for widening the street.
This statute was an amendment to the city charter of the City
of Kansas, passed in 1875. We have carefully examined its
provisions. After giving very full directions as to the preliminary proceedings, such as the ordinance for opening or widening a street, the notices to be given, the summoning of jurors,
and the duties to be performed by them, the recording of
their verdict, &c., ยง 6 declares: "In case the city, or any defendant to such proceedings, shall feel aggrieved by the verdict
of the jury, such party so aggrieved may, within twenty days
from the time the verdict of the jury is confirmed by the common council, appeal to the circuit court in and for the County
of Jackson in this State. If the appeal is taken by either party,
the same shall be taken.and perfected by the filing with the
clerk of the city, within the time aforesaid, such an affidavit as
is required by law, in appealing from the judgment of a justice
of the peace. If any appeal is so taken, the clerk of the said
city shall, within six days from the taking of such appeal, file
a complete transcript of the proceedings, and all papers filed
and used in the trial, certified by him, with the clerk of the
circuit court; and said circuit court shall thereupon become
possessed of the cause, and said cause, unless dismissed, shall
be tried de novo in said court, and the parties thereto shall have
ar speedy trial thereof, and to that end said causes shall have
precedence over all other causes, and if necessary to a full deternination of any question arising in the said cause, the circuit
court shall have power to make and bring in other parties to
such proceedings, on service of notice upon them for six days,
or by publishing a notice to them for the same length of time,
in any daily newspaper printed in said City of Kansas; and the
parties so made by either kind of notice, and all persons claiming under them, shall be bound by such proceedings; . .
and the judge of said circuit court shall have power, and it
shall be his duty to hold a sitting of his court for the speedy
trial thereof, at the court house in said city, at any time in vacation, and summon a jury before him (unless a jury is waived)
for the trial of such appeals only, such trials to be had in all
respects, and subject to the same rules and the same law as

other trials had in the circuit court, and the same record thereof
made and kept. The verdict of the jury, or the finding of the
circuit judge sitting as a jury, as the case may be, shall conform in all respects to the requirements of section three of this
act for the government of the jury making the first assessment,
and the verdict shall have the same force and effect as is provided in regard to said first verdict, and shall be binding on
the parties; and the assessments against private property shall
be paid in the same time, and until paid bear the same rate of
interest as is above provided; and the amount assessed by the
jury against property shall be a lien on the several parcels
of property, charged from the day the ordinance for the improvement takes effect until paid.

.

.

On appeal under

this section the jury shall consist of six men, freeholders of the
city, and be chosen by the judge; and any finding or verdict
in that court shall, unless set aside for good cause, be confirmed, and judgment entered thereon, that the city have and
hold the property sought to be taken for the purposes specified
in the ordinance providing for the improvement, and pay therefor the amount assessed against the city, and full compensation assessed therefor, and that the several lots and parcels of
private property assessed to pay compensation by the verdict
or finding stand charged and be bound respectively for the
payment of assessments, with interest, as provided in this
act.

.

.

We have not been furnished by the counsel on either side
with reference to any decisions of the Mffissouri courts giving
construction to this section. Whether the direction that the
cause shall be tried de novo requires that all the valuations and
assessments are to be retried, or only those affecting the appellants, is not expressly stated. The principle of valuation and
assessment to be followed by the jury is laid down in ยง 3 of
the act, as follows:
"SEc. 3. The jury shall first ascertain the actual damages
done to each person or corporation in consequence of the taking of their property for such purposes, without reference to
the proposed improvement, as the just compensation to be made
therefor; and, second, to pay such compensation, assess against

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

the city the amount of benefit to the city and public generally,
inclusive of benefit to any property of the city, and against
the several lots and parcels of private property deemed benefited, as determined according to the last section, by the proposed improvement, the balance of such compensation; each
lot or parcel of ground to be assessed with an amount bearing
the same ratio to such balance as the benefit to each lot or
parcel bears to the whole benefit to all the private property assessed. Parties interested may submit proof to the jury, and
the latter shall examine personally the property to be taken
and assessed.

"

From this it would seem that the balance of damages for
property taken, after deducting the amount to be paid by the
city, is to be divided and assessed pro rata upon those whose
property is benefited, in proportion to the benefit to each. But
each piece of property taken is valued by itself, "without reference to the proposed improvement," and the amount of benefit
to each piece of property benefited is ascertained separately
without reference to the other pieces benefited. It is only
after this has been done that the aggregate amounts are ascertained and the damages are assessed pro rata against the pieces
of property benefited according to the benefit to each, which
is the result of a mere arithmetical calculation. In the State
Circuit Court the jury ascertains and finds all these facts, and
reports them in one general verdict.
What, then, is the relation in which the railway company,
as an appellant, stands towards the city of Kansas in this litigation? Olearly, it has two distinct issues, or grounds of controversy; first, the value of its property taken for the street;
secondly, the amount of benefit which the widening of the
street will create to its remaining property, not so taken. It
mnay have a third issue, and, judging from the course of the
argument, it has a third issue, still more important to it than
either of the others, to wit, the right of a city to open a street
at all across its depot grounds. Now this controversy involving these three issues, is a distinct controversy between the
company and the city. It may be settled in the same trial with
the other appeals, and by a single jury; but the controversy is

PACIFIC RAILROAD REMOVAL CASES.
Opinion of the Court

a distinct and separate one, and is capable of being tried distinctly and separately from the others. If the State Circuit
Court had equity powers, it might direct a-separate issue for the
trial of this controversy by itself. It might try the other appeals without a jury (the parties waiving a jury), and try this
controversy by a jury.
If this view of the subject is correct, we see no difficulty in
removing the controversy between the city of Kansas and the
railway company for trial in the Circuit Court of the United
States. The proceedings for widening the street, pending in the
State court, may have to await the decision of the case in the
federal court; and the result of those proceedings may be materially affected by the decision of that case; but that consideration does not affect the separate and distinct character of
the controversy between the city and the railway company,
although it might raise a question of proper parties in a pure
chancery proceeding as between the city and the company.
This controversy is to all intents and purposes "a suit." The
indirect effect upon the general proceedings for widening the
street which would ensue in case the federal court should determine that the City of Kansas had no right to widen the
street in the company's depot grounds, or that the valuation of
its property was much too small, or the assessment of benefits
against it was much too large, furnishes no good reason for
depriving the company of its right to remove its suit into a
United States court. We think that the case was removable
to that court under the act of March 3, 1875.
This disposes of all the cases now before us, and renders it
unnecessary to inquire whether the allegations in the several
petitions of removal were, or were not, sufficient to bring the
cases within Rev. Stat. ยง 640; or whether this section still remains in force.
The judment8 are rever8ed in all the case, and the causes
will be reemanded, with in8itctions to enter judgments in aceordance with tM8 opinion.

MILL-ER, dissenting.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Dissenting Opinion : Waite, C.J., Miller, J.

I am unable to agree to these judgments. In my opinion
.Congress did not intend to give the words " arising under the
Constitution or laws of the United States," in the act of 1875,
the broad meaning they have when used by Chief Justice Marshall in the argument of the opinion in Osob'm v. Bank of the
United States, 9 Wheat. 738. I do not doubt the power of
Congress to authorize suits by or against federal corporations
to be brought in the courts of the United States. That was
decided in Osborn's case, and with it I have no fault to find.
Neither do I doubt that Congress did, in the charters under
which these corporations exist, authorize suits by or against
them to be brought in the courts of the United States as well
as in the courts of the States; but I cannot believe that, if the
charters had given jurisdiction to the courts of the United
States in only a limited class of actions, and had provided that
in all others the suits must be brought in the courts of the
proper State, the act of 1875 would have extended the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States to all suits by or
against such corporations when the value of tl]e matter in dispute exceeded $500.
The acts of incorporation made no provision for.the removal
to the courts of the United States of suits begun in a State
court. The act of July 27, 1868, ch. 255, ยง 2, 15 Stat. 227,
now Rev. Stat. ยง 640, did, however, give authority for that
purpose in suits brought against the company in a State court
"upon the petition of such defendant, verified by oath, stating
that such defendant has a defence arising under or by virtue
of the Constitution or of any treaty or law of the United
States." If all suits by or against, and all defences by, a fed
eral corporation necessarily arise under the laws of the United
States "because the charter of incorporation not only creates
it, but gives it every faculty which it possesses," why require
the corporation, when asking for a removal, to cause an oath
to be fied with its petition that it has a defence in the suit
which arises under the Constitution or laws? If, "because the
power to acquire rights of any description, to transact business
of any description, to make contracts of any description, to sue
on those contracts, is given and measured by its charter, and

that charter a law of the United States," every suit by or
against, and every defence to such a suit by, a federal corporation must arise under the laws of the United States, why require it to set forth in its petition for removal that its defence
does arise under such a law? If such a corporation cannot
"have a case which does not arise literally, as well as substantially, under the law," what the necessity for saying more than
that it is such a corporation?
The act of 1868, Rev. Stat. ยง 640, related specifically to this
class of corporations -and this class of suits, and it shows distinctly that the words "arising under the laws of the United
States" were there used in a restricted sense. I see no evidence
of any intention by Congress to use them in any other sense in
the act of 1875, when applied to the same kind of suits and to
the same kind of corporations.
I am authorized to say that MR. JUsTIcE MILERr unites with
me in this dissent.
