CHIF JUSTIcE WA=rr delivered the opinion of the court.
The judgment in this case is for less than five thousand dollars, but the record contains a certificate of division. The motion to dismiss is "on the ground that this court has no jurisdiction upon such a certificate as is filed herein." The record has
not been printed, and in N'ationalBank v. Insurance Co., 100 U.
S. 43, we announced the rule that to get a decision on a motion
to dismiss before printing, the motion papers must present the
case in a way which will enable us to act understandingly without referring to the transcript on file. In this case we have
not been furnished either with a copy of the certificate on
which the motion depends or with an agreed statement of what
it contains. In fact,- there is nothing on which we can act unless we go to the transcript.
o8tThe further considerationof the motion isconsequentlyl
poned until the case isfor hearing on its merits.
