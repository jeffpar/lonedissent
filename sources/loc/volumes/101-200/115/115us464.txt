The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

A Rouse and .Xr.William Grant for defendant in
error.
WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.
This was a suit brought by Van Benthuysen, the defendant
in error, a commission merchant engaged in the sale of manufactured tobacco, to recover back from Stockdale, a collector
of internal revenue, certain taxes paid under protest on the
amount of sales of tobacco in a bonded warehouse. The sole
controversy is about the liability of the merchant to pay taxes
upon the amount of revenue stamps affixed to the tobacco at
the time of its removal from the warehouse. The case was
here at the October Term, 1880, and is reported in 103 U. S.
87. We then decided that he was "not liable to be taxed for
the revenue stamps required to be affixed to the tobacco before
the removal thereof from a bonded warehouse, unless they
were at the time of such sales so afflxed, whereby they entered
into the value of the tobacco and formed a liart of the price
thereof." Under this ruling the judgment of the court below
was reversed, and the cause sent back for a new trial. The
present writ of error was brought for a review of the judgment upon the second trial. The bill of exceptions shows that
the charge to the jury was almost in the exact language of the
opinion of this court construing the law on which the rights of
the parties depend, and it covered the whole case.
Affirmed.
