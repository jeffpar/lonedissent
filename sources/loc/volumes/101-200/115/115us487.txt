IN ERROR TO THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF

MOFFITT & Another v. ]KURTZ.
IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.
Submitted October 14, 1885.-Decided November 2.3,1885.

A writ of habeas corpus is not removable from a State court into a Circuit
Court of the United States under the act of March 3, 1875, ch. 137, § 2.
A police officer of a State, or a private citizen, has no authority as such, without any warrant or military order, to arrest and detain a deserter from the
army of the United States.

A writ of habeas corpus was issued on April 8, 1885, by and
returnable before a judge of the Superior Court of the City
and County of San Francisco, in the State of California, addressed to John Moffitt and T. W. Fields, citizens of that
State, upon the petition of Stephen Kurtz, a citizen of Pennsylvania, alleging that he was by them unlawfully imprisoned
and restrained of his liberty, inasmuch as they had arrested
him as a deserter from the army of the United States, and
had no warrant or authority to arrest him, and were not officers of the United States.
Moffitt and Fields, at the time of entering their appearance
in that court, filed a petition to remove the case into the Circuit Court of the United States, because the parties were citizens of different States, and because the suit involved a ques-

tion arising under the Constitution and laws of the United
States, to wit, the question whether a person who is not an
officer of the United States has authority to arrest a deserter
from the army of the United States. The court ordered the
case to be so removed.
Moffitt and Fields thereupon signed and filed in the Circuit
#
Court the following return:
"Now come the respondents and make this their return to
the writ of habeas corpus herein, and show that respondent J.
Moffitt is a regular police officer of the city and county of San
Francisco, and respondent T. W. Fields is a special police officer
of said city and county; and being such officers as aforesaid,
they arrested the petitioner, Stephen Kurtz, in the city and
county of San Francisco, by the authority of the United States
in this, to wit, that said Stephen Kurtz, under the name of
Stephen Noll, on the 29th day of May, 1876, at Cleveland in
the State of Ohio, enlisted in the Army of the United States
for the term of five years, and on the 17th day of March, 1879,
he being a soldier attached to Co. D of the 21st Regiment of
Infantry of the Army of the United States, stationed at Vancouver Barracks in the Territory of Washington, deserted from
the Army of the United States; and your respondents hold
said petitioner for the purpose of delivering him to the military
authorities of the United States to be tried according to the
laws of the United States."
The Circuit Court, upon motion and hearing, made an order
remanding the case to the Superior Court of San Francisco;
and Moffitt and Fields sued out a writ of error from this court
to reverse that order.
After the case had been so remanded, Kurtz filed in the
Superior Court of San Francisco a suggestion that the return
was insufficient, and that he was entitled to be discharged, for
the following reasons:
"First. It appears by said return that the defendants were
not officers of the United States, but are police officers of the
municipality of San Francisco, and as such they have no
authority to arrest or detain the plaintiff, and as such officers
they have been and are prohibited from arresting or detaining

KURTZ v. MOFFITT.
Argument for Moffitt and Fields.

the plaintiff as a deserter from the United States Army by a
rule of the police department which was in force at the time
of the arrest of the plaintiff, and still is in force, which rule
was and is as follows: 'Police officem are prohibited from
arresting deserters from the United States Army or Navy
without a warrant.'
"Second. The desertion set up in the return is an offence
against the United States, and not against the State of California, of which Commonwealth the defendants are officers,
and they are therefore incompetent to arrest or detain the
plaintiff.
"Third. The desertion set up in the return is barred by
article 103 of section 13412 of the Revised Statutes of the
United States."
The Superior Court, upon a hearing, ordered the writ of
habeas corpus to be dismissed and Kurtz remanded to custody,
and entered judgment accordingly; and he sued out a writ of
error from this court to reverse that judgment, that court being
the highest court of the State in which a decision on the merits
of the case could be had. See R2obb's Case, 64 California, 431,
433, and 111 U. S.624, 627; Barbierv. Connolly, 113 U. S.

I. The Superior Court of San Francisco had no jurisdiction
to proceed with the hearing of the case on the merits, after
the case was removed to the Circuit Court. The case was as
clearly one involving a right under a law of the United States
as was Gordon v. Longest, 16 Pet. 97. The writ of habeas
corpus authorized by § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat.
81-82, reaches every case of unlawful imprisonment under
Federal authority, and every case of imprisonment in contempt
of the national authority. See Sturges v. Crowningshield,4

Pennsylvania,16 Pet. 531, 614; Ableman v. Booth, 21 How.
506, 523 ; Tarble's Case, 13 Wall. 397. The State writ reaches
all cases not reached by the national writ-the latter all cases
not reached by the former-and thus there is no hiatus or confusion. tfnited States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542. As State
courts were more numerous than Federal courts, and reflected
local political opinion, a gradual encroachment on the sphere
of Federal jurisdiction may be traced, which culminated in the
Supreme Court of Wisconsin declaring an act of Congress to
be unconstitutional. The decision in Ableman v. Booth, above
cited, settled that in all matters in which the Federal government has exclusive control, the State shall abstain from interference, as the Federal government abstains from interference
with the government of the States. The conflict of jurisdiction
which resulted from this encroachment may be traced through
the following leading cases. In the matter of Samuel Stacy,

Wise. 390 ; Casey's Case, reviewed in _freill's Case, 8 Blatchford,

which may be traced from 1807 to the present time, as follows: 1807, State v. Plme, T. U. P. Charton, 142; 1809, In re

Argument for Moffitt and Fields.

same causes which produced the first line of decisions axe still
operative, and produce irritation and confusion.
It is contended on the other side that a municipal policeman
cannot exercise Federal power; that all his acts are done in his
character as a State officer. This proposition is not sustained by
the following decisions of this court. Priggv. Pennsylvania,
16 Pet. on page 614 et sey.; Tennessee v. Davis, 100 U. S. on
page 263; .Exparte Virginia,100 U. S. on page 346; Exparte
Ya ' ough, 110 U. S. on page 662. See also 7n, re Smith, and
1n re Slpangler, above cited. Many statutes authorize both
Federal and State officers to perform acts outside of the duties
pertaining to their offices. Rev. Stat. §§ 1014, 1750, 1758,
1778, 2165, 2181, 3066, 3833, 4522, 4546, 4556, 4559, 4606,
5270, 5280.
Ex parte Clodomirno Cota, 110 U. S. 385, is also
instructive on this point.
The Federal government still possesses all the jurisdiction
which can be exercised by habeas corpus in any case arising
under "this constitution, the laws of the United States, and
the treaties made, or which shall be made under their authority."
None of this power has been restored to the State judiciary by
any act of Congress, and if it had been it would still be Federal
power though exercised for the time being by a State officer.
We have shown that many State courts failed to regard the
proper limitations of State and Federal power in the use of the
writ of habeas corpus, but we refer to the following leading
cases, all cited above, to show that some of the State courts
have been sound on this question: State v. .feBride; In re
Sim8; ie Spangler. We claim that the jurisdiction which the
State has surrendered, and parted with, and transferred to the
United States, and which Congress has conferred on the
Circuit and District Courts of the United States is not retained
and cannot be exercised by the State courts. "No court can exercise judicial power unless it is derived from some government
or sovereignty." Allsrnan v. Booth, cited above. The Superior
Court had no power or authority under the Constitution and
laws of California, to hear this case after the removal thereof
to the Circuit Court. The Federal laws gave the Superior
Court no power to hear it after the removal. The case was

one which belonged to the Federal judiciary and which did not
belong to the State judiciary, and the Superior Court should
have dismissed the case as moved by the defendants.
II. As to the judgment remanding the prisoner. (1) Desertion is a crime against the United States, 2 Stat. 136, 302;
Rev. Stat. § 1342, Art. 47, and may be punished by imprisonment with hard labor, which may extend to life. (2) The plea
of the statute of limitations under the articles of war or the
penal code cannot be received on habeas corpus. In 'e Arno
White, 9 Sawyer, 49, 52; -Ex parte Reed, 100 U. S. 13. (3)
The defendants had the right to arrest the plaintiff. They
were citizens of the United States; as such, parties to the Constitution, Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. on page 404 ; and
bound to observe its laws. Those laws forbid desertion, and
offer rewards for the arrest of deserters. Rev. Stat. § 1120.
Every citizen has a right to accept this offer, and becomes
thereby the agent of the Federal government, with authority
to use force to execute the supreme law. Exparte Siebold, 100
U. S. 371, 395 ; Eejarte Yarbrough, 110 U. S.651, 662. (4)
Desertion is continuous, and is an infamous crime. Congress
has given a legislative definition of crimes, "not capital or
otherwise infamous," in Rev. Stat. Dist. Col. § 1049, "that is
to say" "all simple assaults and batteries and all other misdemeanors not punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary."
This court has construed this language in Ex-parte Wilson, 114
U. S. 417. It has already been shown what the punishment
for desertion may be. (5) No special warrant was necessary
for the arrest of the deserter. A warrant in law exists when
a statute authorizes the doing of an act. Under Rev. Stat.
§ 1014, for any crime against the United States, the offender
may be arrested by any "magistrate according to the usual
mode of process in such State," and § 836, Penal Code of California, prescribes that, in case of felony, or when the offender
is arrested in the act, a special warrant is unnecessary, the
statute being the warrant. Under the Fifth Amendment to
the Constitution crimes are infamous or not infamous, or as
designated in §§ 16, 17, Penal Code, felonies and misdemeanors.
Desertion has none of the indicia of a misdemeanor, but has

KURTZ v. MOFFITT.
Argument for Moffitt and Fields.

all the features of a felony, and we are authorized to apply to
it the felony procedure which justifies an arrest without a
special warrant in cases where the statute is the warrant. On
this question, the State is not and cannot be neutral. The deserter is not a citizen, and the State can give him no asylum.
The crime he has committed is not against a foreign government, but against a sovereignty whose dominion extends to
every foot of territory which any State can claim. All State
officers, under article 20, § 3, Constitution of California, are
enlisted on the side of the Federal government. The defendants not only had the power, but it was highly proper for
them, to make this arrest. In re Lafonte, 2 Rob. La. 498. In
arresting a deserter the power and authority of the State is not
exercised. The State legislature could not prohibit or punish
the arrest of a deserter from the United States army, because
any such law would interfere with the powers of the national
government. The rule of the police department is of no more
force than if it were an act of the legislature, and as an act of
the legislature it would be unconstitutional, being contrary to
the supreme law of the land. Taje v. flurey, 5 West Coast
Reporter, 692.
Desiring to present all that may aid the court in the solution of the question, we also refer to the following State decisions: (1852.) Hutelings v. 'Fan Bokkelen, 34 Maine, 126.
The action was replevin for the person. The deserter was remanded, and it was held that no special warrant was required
for the arrest of a deserter. (1863.) Trask v. Payne,43 Barb.
569. The action was for damages which were given against a
deputy sheriff. This case is cited by the plaintiff. We remark
that the order of July 31, 1862, cited in that case, has been
superseded- by the act of Congress of March 3, 1863, § 7 of
which made it "the duty of the provost marshals to arrest all
deserters and send them to the nearest military post." The
same act (§ 26) authorized the President to issue a proclamation in regard to deserters. The President accordingly did
"call on all good citizens to aid in restoring absent soldiers to
their regiments." See Gen. Order 325, 1863, Army Reg. 1863,
§g 156-7; Army Reg. 1881, p. 28, § 214. (1866:) Huber v.

MR.

JUSTICE

GRY delivered the opinion of the court. After

stating the facts in the language reported above, he continued:
The first question to be considered is whether this case was
rightly remanded to the State court, or should have been retained and decided in the Circuit Court of the United States,
into which it had been removed on a petition filed under the
act of March 3, 1875, ch. 137, § 2.
In order to justify the removal of a case from a State court
into the Circuit Court under this act, it is not enough that it
arises under the Constitution and ]aws of the United States, or
that it is between citizens of different States, but it must be a
"suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, where the matter
in dispute exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of five
hundred dollars." 18 Stat. 470.
A writ of habeas corpus, sued out by one arrested for crime,
is 'a civil suit or proceeding, brought by him to assert the civil
right of personal liberty, against those who are holding him in
custody as a criminal. Ex _parte Tom Tong, 108 U. S. 556.
To assist in determining whether it is, within the meaning of
the act of 1875, a "suit at law or in equity where the matter
in dispute exceeds the sum or value of five hundred dollars,"
it will be convenient to refer to the use and the interpretation
of like words in earlier acts defining the jurisdiction of the
national courts.
The Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, ch. 20, § 22, authorized "final judgments and decrees in civil actions and suits
in equity in a Circuit Court, where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of two thousand dollars, exclusive of
costs," to be revised by this court on writ'of error or appeal.

KURTZ v. MOFFITT.
Opinion of the Court.

1 Stat. 84. The act of April 2, 1816, ch. 39, § 1, provided that
no cause should be brought to this court by appeal or writ of
error from the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia " unless the matter in dispute in such cause shall be of the value of
one thousand dollars or upwards, exclusive of costs." 3 Stat.
261.
In Lee v. Lee, 8 Pet. 44, decided in 1834, a petition to the
Circuit Court for the District of Columbia set forth that the
petitioners were entitled to their freedom, and were held in
slavery by the defendant; he pleaded that they were not entitled to their freedom as they had alleged; upon that plea
issue was joined, and a verdict and judgment rendered for the
defendant; and the petitioners sued out a writ of error. A
preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of this court was overruled, and the judgment below considered on the merits and
reversed. The ground of the decision upon the question of
jurisdiction appears to have, been that the single matter in dispute between the parties was the freedom or slavery of the
petitioners-to the petitioners, the value of their freedom, not
to be estimated in money; to the defendant, claiming to be
their owner, the pecuniary value of the slaves as property,
which, if he had been the plaintiff in error, might have been
ascertained by affidavits. 8 Pet. 48.
In Barry v. .ercein, 5 How. 103, decided in 184:7, this court
dismissed for want of jurisdiction a writ of error to reverse a
judgment of the Circuit Court for the Southern District of
New York, refusing to grant to a father a writ of habeas
corpus to take his child out of. the custody of his wife who
was living apart from him. Chief Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion, after quoting the 22d section of the Judiciary
Act of 1789, said: "In order, therefore, to give us appellate
power under this section, the matter in dispute must be money,
or some right, the value of which in money can be estimated
and ascertained." "The words of the act of Congress are plain.
and unambiguous. They give the right of revision in those
cases only where the rights of property are concerned, and
where the matter in dispute has a known and certain value,
which can be proved and calculated, in the ordinary mode of

OCTOBER TERM, 1885.
Opinion of the Court.

a business transaction. There are no words in the law, which
by any just interpretation can be held to extend the appellate
jurisdiction beyond those limits, and authorize us to take cognizance of cases to which no test of money value can be applied.
Nor indeed is this limitation upon the appellate power of this
court confined to cases like the one before us. It is the same
in judgments in criminal cases, although the liberty or life of
the party may depend on the decision of the Circuit Court.
And since this court can exercise no appellate power unless it
is conferred by act of Congress, the writ of error in this case
must be dismissed." 5 How. 120, 121.
In Pratt v. ]Fitzhugh, 1 Black, 271, decided in 1861, this
court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a writ of error to reverse a judgment of the Circuit Court for the Northern District of New York, discharging on habeas corpus persons imprisoned upon an execution issued by that court directing the
marshal to levy the amount of a decree for $21,581.28 out of
their goods and chattels, and, for want thereof, to arrest and
keep them until the moneys were paid. Mr. Justice Nelson,
in delivering the opinion, said that the 22d section of the
Judiciary Act had always been held to mean a property value;
and he distinguished the case of Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet.
540, (which was a Writ of error to reverse a judgment of the
Supreme Court of Vermont on habeas corpus, remanding to
custody a prisoner under a warrant of extradition from the
Governor of that State,) upon the ground that it was brought
up from a State court under the 25th section of the Judiciary
Act, in which case no value was required.
In DeKrfft v. Barwey, 2 Black, 704, decided in 1862, an appeal was taken from.a decree of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, awarding the custody of a child to the father
as against the divorced mother; and Lee v. Lee, above cited,
was referred to as supporting the right of appeal. But this
court dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction, Chief Justice Taney saying that the case was not distinguishable from
Barry v. Xercein, above cited, and in that case it was held
"that in order to give this court jurisdiction under the 22d
section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the matter in dispute must

KURTZ v. MOFFITT.
Opinion of the Court.

be money, or some right, the value of which could be calculated
and ascertained in money."
The act of February 5, 1867, ch. 28, § 1, conferring power
upon the judges of the national courts to issue writs of habeas
corpus in cases of persons restrained of their liberty in violation of the Constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United
States, expressly gave an appeal to this court from the judgment of a Circuit Court in such cases. 14 Stat. 385. Shortly
after the passage of this act, Mr. Justice :Nelson refused to
allow an appeal from a judgment of the Circuit Court for the
Southern District of New York upon a writ of habeas corpus
issued under the 14th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, because no appeal was provided by law in the case of a habeas
corpus issued under that act, and the appeal given by the act
of 1867 was confined to cases begun under it. In e Heinrich,
5 Blatchford, 414, 427. And within two years afterwards it
was determined by this court that, independently of the act of
1867 (which was repealed by the act of March 27, 1868, ch. 34,
15 Stat. 44,) this court (except in a small class of cases of commitments for acts done or omitted under alleged authority of a
foreign government, as to which provision was made by the
act of August 99, 1842, ch. 257, 5 Stat. 539,) had no jurisdiction by direct appeal to revise the judgments of inferior courts
in cases of habeas corpus, but could only do so by itself issuing
writs of habeas corpus and certiorari under the general powers
conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789. Exparte XcCardle,

and appeals from the final decisions of the Supreme Courts of

of the United States, "where the value of the property or the
amount in controversy exceeds one thousand dollars, except
that a writ of error or appeal shall be allowed"' to this court

"upon writs of habeas corpus involving the question of personal
freedom," clearly implies that writs of habeas corpus would not
be included if not specially mentioned. See also Potts v.
Chuma ero, 92 U. S. 358; Elgin v. Marshall, 106 U. S. 578,
580; Curtis on U. S. Courts, 65.
From this review of the statutes and decisions, the conclusion is inevitable that a jurisdiction, conferred by Congress
upon any court of the United States, of suits at law or in equity
in which the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of a
certain number of dollars, includes no case in which the right
of neither party is Capable of being valued in money; and
therefore that writs of habeas corpus are not removable from
a State court into a Circuit Court of the United States under
the act of March 3, 1875, ch. 137, § 2, and this case was rightly
remanded to the State court.
We are then brought to a consideration of the merits of the
case, as presented by the writ of error sued out by the prisoner
to reverse the judgment of the State court remanding him to
custody.
The case, as shown by the record, is briefly this: Kurtz, a
deserter from the army of the United States, was, without
any warrant or express authority, arrested by Moffitt and
Fields, police officers of the city of San Francisco, and citizens
of the State of California and of the United States, and held by
them for the purpose of being delivered to the military authorities of the United States to be tried according to the laws of
the United States; and be claims immunity from being arrested for a military crime by persons not military officers of
the United States and having no express authority from the
United States or from such officers to arrest him.
If a police officer or a private citizen has the right, without
warrant or express authority, to arrest a military deserter, the
right must be derived either from some rule of the law of England which has become part of our law, or from the legislation of Congress.
By the common law of England, neither a civil officer nor a
private citizen had the right without a warrant to make an arrest for a crime not committed in his presence, except in the

case of felony, and then only for the purpose of bringing the
offender before a civil magistrate. 1 Hale P. C. 587-590; 2

6D.&R. 623;S. C.,4 B. & 0.596. No crime was considered a
felony which did not occasion a total forfeiture of the offender's
lands, or goods, or both. 4 Bl. Com. 91,95 E paczrte Wilson,
114 U. S. 417, 423. And such a forfeiture did not follow upon
conviction by a court martial of a crime not punishable b y the
courts of common law. Co. Lit. 391 a.; I Clode's Military
Forces of the Crown, 176.
By some early English statutes, which appear to have been
in force down to the Revolution of 1688, desertion was made
felony, punishable in the civil courts. 3 Inst. 86, 87; 1 Hale

by the Mutiny Acts, beginning with the statute of 1 W. & M.,
ch. 5, and re-enacted almost every year since, for the first time
authorized mutiny and desertion to be punished at the sentence
of a court martial in time of peace. Lord Hardwicke, in 14

From 1708, the English Mutiny Acts have repeatedly, if not
uniformly, contained provisions by which persons reasonably
suspected of being deserters might be apprehended by a constable, and taken before a justice of the peace, and the fact of
their desertion established to his satisfaction, before their surrender to the military authorities. Stats. 7 Anne, ch. 4, § 43,
and 10 Anne, ch. 13, § 42, 9 Statutes of the Realm, 58, 576;
Clode on Military Law, 93, 209; Tytler on Military Law (3d
Ed.) 200. By the recent acts, provision is made for their apprehension by a military officer or soldier, if a constable cannot
be immediately met with; and it is at least an open question
whether a man whom a military officer causes to be apprehended as a deserter and delivered to an officer of the guard,
without having him brought before the civil magistrate, may
not maintain an action against the officer who causes his arrest,

arthough he cannot sue the officer of the guard if it is the duty
of the latter under the Articles of War to receive and hold
all prisoners so delivered to him by a military officer. FoZton v. Gavin, 16 Q. B. 48, 81; Iolton v. .Freese,16 Q. B. 81,
note.
It does not appear to have ever been the law of England
that a peace officer or a private citizen could as such, and without any warrant or order either from a civil magistrate or
from a military officer, lawfully arrest a deserter for the purpose of delivering him to the military authorities for trial by
court martial.
In the United States, the line between civil and military
jurisdiction has always been maintained. The Fifth Article
of Amendment of the Constitution, which declares that "no
person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand
jury," expressly excepts "cases arising in the land or naval
forces;" and leaves such cases subject to the rules for the government and regulation of those forces which, by the eighth
section of the First Article of the Constitution, Congress is empowered to make. Courts martial form no part of the judicial
system of the United States, and their proceedings, within the
limits of their jurisdiction, cannot be controlled or revised by
the civil courts. Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65; Ex parte
Mfason, 105 U. S. 696; Tfales v. Wtitney, 114 U. S. 561.
Congress has never conferred upon civil officers or magistrates
or private citizens any power over offenders punishable only in
a military tribunal. Section 1014 of the Revised Statutes,
which provides that, "for any -crime or offence against tho
United States, the offender may, by any justice or judge of
the United States," or commissioner of a Circuit Court, or by
any judge, mayor, justice of the peace or magistrate of any
State where he may be found, "and agreeably to the usual
mode of process against offenders in such State, and at the expense of the United States, be arrested and imprisoned, or
bailed, as the case may be, for. trial before such court of the
United States as by law has cognizance of the offence," and
that "copies of the process shall be returned as speedily as

KURTZ v. MOFFIT-.
Opinion of the Court.

may be into the clerk's office of such court," manifestly applies
to proceedings before the civil courts only.
From the very year of the Declaration of Independence,
Congress has dealt with desertion as exclusively a military
crime, triable and punishable, in time of peace, as well as in
time of war, by court martial only, and not by the civil tribunals; the only qualification being that since 1830 the punishment of death cannot be awarded in time of peace. Articles
of War of September 20, 1776, sect. 6, art. 1, 2 Journals of
Congress, 347, continued in force by the act of September 29,
1789, ch. 25, § 4, 1 Stat. 96; acts of March 16, 1802, ch. 9,
§ 18; April 10, 1806, ch. 20, art. 20; January 11, 1812, ch. 14,
§ 16; January 29, 1813, ch. 16, § 12; 2 Stat. 136, 362, 673,
796; May 29, 1830, ch. 183, 4 Stat. 418; Rev. Stat. § 1342,
arts. 47, 48.
The provisions of the Revised Statutes concerning the trial
and punishment of deserters are as follows: By § 1342, "the
armies of the United States shall be governed by the following
rules and articles;" "and the convictions mentioned therein
shall be understood to be convictions by court martial." By
article 47, any officer or soldier who deserts the service of the
United States "shall, in time of war, suffer death, or such
other punishment as a court martial may direct; and in time
of peace, any punishment, excepting death, which a court
martial may direct;" and by article 48, every soldier who
deserts "shall be tried by a court martial and punished, although the time of his enlistment may have elapsed previous
to his being apprehended and tried." The provisions of
§§ 1996 and 1998, which re-enact the act of March 3, 1865, ch.
79, § 21, 13 Stat. 490, and subject every person deserting the
military service of the United States to additional penalties,
namely, forfeiture of all rights of citizenship, and disqualification to hold any office of trust or profit, can only take effect
upon conviction by a court martial, as was clearly shown by
Mr. Justice Strong, when a judge of the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania, in Hfuber v. Reily, 53 Penn. St. 112, and has
been uniformly held by the civil courts as well as by the military authorities. State v. Symondq, 57 Maine, 148; Severance

420; Winthrop's Digest of Judge Advocate General's Opinions,
225.
The Articles of War have likewise always provided that any
officer or soldier who advises or persuades any other officer or
soldier to desert the service shall be punished by court martial.
Articles of War of September 20, 1776, sect. 6, art. 4; act of
April 10, 1806, ch. 20, art. 23; Rev. Stat. § 1342, art. 51.
Section 5455 of the Revised Statutes, which re-enacts the act
of March 3, 1863, ch. 75, § 24, 12 Stat. '135, embracing the provisions of earlier statutes, and by which every person who entices or procures a soldier to desert the military service of the
United States, or who aids a soldier in deserting, or knowingly
harbors a soldier who has deserted, "or who refuses to give up
and deliver such soldier at the demand of any officer authorized
to receive him," is to be punished by fine and imprisonment,
merely provides for the punishment of civilians, not subject to
the Articles of War, who are accessories to the crime of desertion by a soldier, or who do any of the acts specified tending
to promote his commission of that crime. It has no application to the crime of the soldier himself, and no tendency to
show that he may be arrested by a private citizen without
authority from a military officer.
Indeed, the last clause
above quoted has rather the opposite tendency.
The respondents contend that their authority to make this
arrest is to be implied from the usage of offering rewards for
the apprehension of deserters, which has existed from a very
early date.
On May 31, 1786, the Congress of the Confederation passed
the following resolve:. "Resolved, That the commanding
officer of any of the forces in the service of the United States
shall, upon report made to him of any desertions in the troops
under his orders, cause the most immediate and vigorous search
to be made after the deserter or deserters, which may be conducted by a commissioned or non-commissioned officer, as the
case shall require. That, if such search should prove ineffectual,
the officer commanding the regiment or corps to which the
deserter or deserters belonged shall insert in the nearest gazette

or newspaper an advertisement, descriptive of the deserter or
deserters, and offerifig a reward, not exceeding ten dollars, for
each deserter who shall be apprehended and secured in any of
the gaols of the neighboring States. That the charges of advertising deserters, the reasonable extra expenses incurred by
the person conducting the pursuit, and the reward, shall be
paid by the Secretary at War, on the certificate of the commanding officer of the troops." 11 Journals of Congress, 81.
Since the adoption of the Constitution, Congress has never
passed any similar resolve or statute: and the only legislation
upon the subject, that has come to our notice, is in the provision made in the annual army appropriation acts from 1844 to
1876, "for the apprehension of deserters, and the expenses incidental to their pursuit," and from 1877 to the present time,
"for the apprehension, securing and delivery of deserters, and
the expense incident to their pursuit." Acts of June 17, 1844,
ch. 106, 5 Stat. 697; July 24, 1876, ch. 226, 19 Stat. 98; November 21, 1877,'ch. 1, 20 Stat. 2; 1885, ch. 339, 23 Stat. 359.
These acts clearly confer no authority upon any one, not otherwise lawfully authorized, to arrest a deserter.
For many years, the Army Regulations, promulgated by the
Secretary of War under authority of the President, have generally provided, as in those of 1821 and 184:1, that a certain
pecuniary reward "shall be paid to any person who may apprehend and deliver a deserter" to an officer of the army; or,
as in the later regulations, that a like reward "will be paid for
the apprehension and delivery of a deserter to an officer of the
army at the most convenient post or recruiting station." Army
Regulations of 1821, art. 69, § 104; 1841, art. 30, § 123 ; 1857,
art. 18, § 152; 1861, art. 18, § 156; 1863, art. 18, § 156, and
appx. B,§ 48; 1881, art. 22, § 214.
The Army Regulations derive their force from the power of
the President as commander-in-chief, and are binding upon
all within the sphere of his legal and constitutional authority.

United States v. Elia8on, 16 Pet. 291; United States v. Freevan, 3 How. 556. Whether they could, in time of peace, and
without the assent of Congress, confer authority upon civil
officers or private citizens to enforce the military law need not

Opinion of the Court.

be considered, because the regulations in question cannot be
construed as undertaking to confer such authority. They do
not command or authorize any civilian to arrest or detain deserters, but merely direct the payment of a reward for every
deserter actually brought in, and justify the military officers in
paying the reward and receiving and holding the deserter.
The President's proclamation and order of March 10, 1863,
13 Stat. 775, commanding all soldiers absent without leave to
return to their regiments, on pain of being arrested and punished as deserters, and calling upon all good citizens "to aid in
restoring to their regiments all soldiers absent without leave,"
is not now in force. It was issued in time of war, for a temporary purpose, under § 26 of the act of March 3, 1863, ch. 75,
12 Stat. 731, which has been repealed by §§ 5595 and 5596 of
the Revised Statutes.
The rule of the common law, that a peace officer or a private
citizen may arrest a felon without a warrant, has been generally held by the courts of the several States t6 be in force in
cases of felony punishable by the civil tribunals. TFakely v.
Hart, 6 Binney, 316; Holley v, .Aim, 3 Wend. 350; Bohan v.
Sawin, 5 Cush. 281; Brockway v. Crawford, 3 Jones (No. Car.)
433; ]?euck v. .AcGregor, 3 Yroom, 70; Burns v. Eren, 40
N. Y. 463; State v. Holmes, 48 N. H. 377. But that rule has
never, so far as we are informed, been judicially extended to the
case of an offender against the military law, punishable exclusively by court martial. In THutchings v. Van Bokkellen, 31
Maine, 126, in which it was held that an officer of the army
might lawfully arrest a deserter and hold him for trial by court
martial, without a warrant, and that proof that the person
making the arrest was de facto such an officer was sufficient,
it was not even suggested that the arrest could be supported
without any evidence of his military authority. And in Trask
v. Payne, 43 Barb. 569, it was decided that a civil officer or
private citizen could not lawfully arrest a deserter without
express order or warrant.
Sections 836, 837, 849, of the Penal Code of California of
1872, affirming the authority of a peace officer, without a
warrant, or a private person, to make an arrest "for a public

SHEPHERD v. MAY.
Syllabus.

offence committed or attempted in his presence," as well as in
cases of felony, and requiring the person arrested to be taken
forthwith before a magistrate, evidently have in view civil
offences only, and if they could be construed to include such
offences against the United States, certainly do not include
offences which are not triable and punishable except by court
martial.
Upon full consideration of the question, and examination of
the statutes, army regulations, and other authorities, cited in
the elaborate argument for the respondents, or otherwise
known to us, we are of opinion that by the existing law a
peace officer or a private citizen has no authority as such, and
without the order or direction of a military officer, to arrest
or detain a deserter from the army of the United States.
Whether it is expedient for the public welfare and the good of
the army that such an authority should be conferred is a matter for the determination of Congress.
It is therefore ordered that tte judgment of the Circuit Court,
remnanding the case to the Superior Court of the City and
County of San,Francisco,be aJfirned ; and that the fnal
judgment of said Superior Court be reversed, and the case
reemanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

Argued November 11, 1885.-Decided November 23, 1885.

A conveyance of real estate subject to a deed of trust executed by the vendor to
secure the payment of a note, does not, without words importing that the
vendee assumes the payment of the note, subject the latter to any liability
to pay it.
An express promise made to the vendor by the vendee of real estate conveyed
to him subject to a deed of trust executed to secure a debt, that he will
pay the debt, does not, without the assent of the creditor, make the vendee
the principal debtor, and the vendor the surety.
