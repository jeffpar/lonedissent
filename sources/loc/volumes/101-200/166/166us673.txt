BALTIMORE v. BALTIMORE TRUST AND GUARANTEE COMPANY.
APPEAL

FROM

THE

CIRCUIT

COURT

OF

THE

UNITED

STATES

FOR

THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND.
No. 209.

Argued March 11, 12, 1897.- Decided April 26, 189T.

The direction of the municipal authorities of Baltimore to the street railroad company to maintain but one track through Lexington street from
and to the points named, instead of a double track as originally granted
to the company, did not substantially change the terms of the contract
(if there was one) between the city and the railroad as expressed in the
original grant, and was no more than the exercise by the city of its acknowledged power to make a reasonable regulation concerning the use
of the street by the railroad company.

THE appellee, being the plaintiff below, brought this action in
the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Maryland, for the purpose of enjoining the city authorities from tearing up or interfering with the railroad track laid down by the
Lake Roland Elevated Railroad Company on Lexington street,
in the city of Baltimore. The bill and the answer were duly
filed in April, 1893, and the following are substantially the facts
upon which the case was heard and determined by the court
below:
The plaintiff sued as trustee and mortgagee named in a mortgage executed by the Lake Roland Company to secure the payment of certain bonds issued and to be issued by the company for
the purpose of raising funds to construct its road. The mortgage was upon all the property of the company, its railroad,
plant, tracks, etc., and was executed on the 1st day of September
in the year 1892. The amount of the bonds which the mortgage
so secured was a million dollars, the principal payable on the 1st
of September in the year 1942. It was on the ground that the
proposed action, hereafter mentioned, on the part of the city
authorities would result in a most material impairment of the security of the mortgage that this suit was brought by the trustee
and mortgagee for the purpose of restraining such action.
The Lake Roland Company was the result of a consolidation

of two railway companies, one of which, called the North Avenue Railway Company of Baltimore city, had the franchise
to construct and operate a passenger railway in the city of
Baltimore, the whole line of which road was to be located in
that city. The Lake Roland Company succeeded to all the
rights acquired by the North Avenue Railway Company. The
legislature of Maryland, by the act of the Laws of 1890,
c. 370, among other things enacted that "the mayor and city
council of Baltimore shall have the power to regulate the use
of the streets, lanes and alleys in said city by railway or other
tracks," etc. On the 8th of April, 1891, the common council
of Baltimore passed what is termed ordinance No. 23, by which
it authorized the North Avenue Railway Company of Baltimore city, in connection with its tracks in other streets mentioned in the ordinance, "to lay down and construct double
iron railway tracks for the purposes of its business,
on Lexington street westwardly to Charles street from North
street." This is a distance of about eleven hundred feet. The
right was also given to the company to operate its road by electricity supplied from overhead wires, and the tracks, wires and
poles were to be laid and constructed under the supervision and
direction of the city commissioner. Various other conditions
and regulations were contained in the ordinance, all of which
the railroad company accepted. As a portion of the road to be
constructed consisted of an elevated road, it became necessary
to obtain the sanction of the legislature before the company
undertook the execution of the work. Accordingly chapter
112 of the Laws of 1892 was passed, the first section of which
ratified and confirmed ordinance No. 23, with "the same effect
as if the mayor and city council of Baltimore, at the time of
the passage of said ordinance, bad been fully authorized by the
general assembly to pass said ordinance, and to grant each and
all of the powers and privileges therein contained; the said
mayor and city council to have the same power and control
hereafter in reference to the enforcement, amendment or repeal
of said ordinance as it has or would have in respect to any ordinance passed under its general powers."
Subsequently to the passage of this act of 1892, the Lake

BALTIMORE v. BALTIMORE TRUST COMPANY.

675

Statement of the Case.
Roland Company, in the summer and fall of 1892, commenced
to lay its tracks in the city and to build a portion of its
elevated road. Prior to the laying down of any tracks on
Lexington street, between North and Calvert streets, the
latter being a street which crosses Lexington street between
North and Charles streets at a distance of between three and
four hundred feet west from North street, it became known to
the railroad company that the mayor and some of the city
authorities were opposed to the laying of double tracks in that
street between those points. This was a short time prior to
the 7th day of November, 1892. On that day the mayor
wrote a letter to the president of the railway company, in
which he stated that lie had noticed the company had commenced laying double tracks on Lexington street, between
North and Calvert streets, and that the public interest in his
judgment required that no more than a single track should be
laid on Lexington street at that point, and that the law
officers of the city had informed him that it was competent
for the city council to prohibit the laying of double tracks
there. The mayor also stated that at the next session of the
council an ordinance would be introduced prohibiting the
company from laying double tracks on the portion of Lexington street above described. He ended by saying: "I write
you this to prevent you from going to the unnecessary expense of laying a system of double tracks and afterwards
being required to remove them." On the same day the president of the railroad company received from the city solicitor a
notice that he was, at the request of the mayor, preparing an
ordinance to prohibit the railroad company from laying more
than a single track on Lexington street, between North and
Calvert, and he offered to permit the president of the railroad
company to see the proposed ordinance before it was sent to
the council. It is stated, however, on the part of the railroad
company that at no time prior to the 12th day of November,
1892, two days prior to the passage of the ordinance hereafter
spoken of, was there any intimation given to the officers of
the company that there was any opposition to the laying of
the company's double tracks on Lexington street, between

Statement of the Case.

Calvert and Charles streets, which was a distance of between
seven and eight hundred feet immediately west of Calvert
street, and the portion of Lexington street, between Calvert
and North streets, was immediately east from Calvert street.
It is asserted on the part of the company that it laid the
double tracks on Lexington street, between Calvert and
Charles streets, without opposition on the part of any one so
far as it knew, but it admits that it did lay the double tracks
between North and Calvert streets, notwithstanding the receipt of the letters mentioned and in spite of the known
opposition of the mayor. This work was done, between North
and Calvert streets, during the night and on election day, so
that before the 14th of November, 1892, the work of laying
the double tracks on Lexington street had been substantially
completed the whole distance between North and Charles
streets. The common council of the city met on the day last
named, and passed "An ordinance to regulate the use of
Lexington street between North street and Charles street,
by railway tracks, and to prohibit the laying or maintaining
or using by North Avenue Railway Company, or any other
person or corporation, of more than a single iron railway track
upon said portion of Lexington street." The first section of
this ordinance reads as follows:
"SECTION 1. Be it enacted and ordained by the mayor and
city council of Baltimore, That the first section of ordinance
No. 23, approved April 8, 1891, so far as the same authorized
and empowered the North Avenue Railway Company to lay
double iron railway tracks upon the portion of East Lexington
street between North street and Charles street, be, and hereby
is, repealed, and that the authority and license given to said
North Avenue Railway Company by said first section of said
ordinance to lay such double iron railway tracks, be, and
hereby is, revoked."
(It will be observed that this ordinance, instead of confining
the single track to that portion only of Lexington street lying
between North and Calvert streets, as spoken of by the mayor,
included the whole of Lexington street between North and
Charles streets.)

'BALTIMORE v. BALTIMORE TRUST COMPANY.

677

Statement of the Case.
The second section of the same ordinance prohibited any
person or corporation from laying down railway tracks on
Lexington street except as provided in the succeeding section
of the ordinance, and directed that all tracks which had been
theretofore placed on Lexington street should be removed by
the persons who laid them, within ten days after they received
notice to that effect from the city commissioner.
The third section authorized the railroad company to lay
down and maintain one track and no more on Lexington
street, "upon the same terms and subject to the same provisions and limitations as were provided by the city ordinance
No. 23, of April 8, 1891, in respect to double iron railway
tracks there authorized to be laid on said portion of Lexington
street." The third section contained also the following proviso: "Provided, as a condition precedent to the right of the
North Avenue Railway Company to exercise the authority
or license in this section conferred upon it, the said North
Avenue Railway Company shall within twenty days from
the passage of this ordinance, at its own expense, remove
the whole or such portion of the double iron railway tracks
that it has caused to be laid on said portion of Lexington
street, as the city commissioner shall designate, and shall
also, at its own expense, replace the pavement on the said portion of East Lexington street in a manner satisfactory to the
city commissioner."
After the passage of this ordinance and before the expiration of the twenty days mentioned in the proviso to the third
section, the railroad company, not admitting the right of
the city to pass such ordinance or to compel the company to
take up one of its tracks, and yet being embarrassed by the
proviso as to the necessity of taking up the tracks within
twenty days, came to ail understanding with the city authorities that, as both parties desired a speedy determination of
the question of law, a case should be made which should raise
that question, and it should be presented to the courts for their
decision, and that in the meantime the provision limiting the
time in which to take up the track would not be enforced.
Accordingly a bill was filed in the city court of Baltimore by

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.

the railroad company raising the question, and a demurrer
on the part of the city was served and a decree taken against
the company proforma in that court. An appeal was then
taken by the company to the Court of Appeals of Maryland,
which court after full argument of the question decided the
case on its merits, and affirmed the judgment of dismissal
directed by the court below. Iake Roland Elevated Railway
v. Baltimore, 77 Maryland, 352. This decision was rendered
about the 16th of March, 1893.
Thereafter the railroad company took up one of its tracks
on Lexington street and located the other under the direction
of the city commissioner and proceeded with due
diligence to
lay down a single track on Lexington street and to restore the
street to its proper condition.
While engaged in this work and on the 1st of April, 1893,
the mayor notified the company by letter that he.was advised
that the company had no authority to lay its track on the bed
of Lexington street between North and Charles stre, ts in the
absence of an ordinance granting such a privilege from the
mayor and city council. (This letter, it is suppoc;d, was
based upon the proposition that the company had ijot complied with the condition contained in the ordinance of November, 1892, already mentioned.) The mayor therefore advised
the company that, in the opinion of the city law officers, the
present single track of the company occupying the bed of the
street was a violation of law. A suggestion was made by him
that an application for an ordinance be at once made to the
city council, and that there should be no delay in the matter,
as the public -convenience required Lexington street to be
promptly made passable by repaving. The president of the
company replied, declining, under the circumstances, to ask
for the passage of another ordinance, because, as he was
advised and believed, the company already had a clear right
to lay down and maintain its tracks on Lexington street.
The mayor, on April 5, 1893, then notified the company that
on Wednesday5 April 12, the commissioner would commence
to take up the tracks on Lexington street, unless in the meantime the railroad company applied to the city council, which

Statement of the Case.

would meet on April 10, for an ordinance giving it a right
to keep its track on the street.
Soon afterwards, and on the 15th of April, 1893, this suit
Was commenced. In the bill it was alleged that if the city
were permitted to take up the tracks it would be impossible
for the company to reach its terminus at the corner of Charles
and Lexington streets, and that as the entire railway system
of the company was on the eve of completion and operation,
it would suffer great damage by the removal of the tracks;
the plaintiff also claimed that ordinance No. 23, having been
accepted and acted upon by the railroad company, there was
thereby constituted an irrepealable and inviolable contract between the municipal corporation and the railroad company, the
terms of which could not be altered or impaired without the
consent of both parties to the contract, and that, therefore,
the subsequent ordinance purporting to change the terms of
the original so as to deprive the railroad company of the right
to reach its terminus with double tracks was in contravention
of the tenth section of the first article of the Constitution of
the United States, which prevents legislation which impairs the
obligation of contracts, and for that reason the subsequent ordinance was void. It was also alleged that the proposed action
of the city authorities was not only invalid, but that it tended
directly to impair the value of the mortgage security held by
the plaintiff trust company as trustee for the bondholders.
On the other side it was alleged on the part of the common
council that the original ordinance was nothing but a revocable license, and that the existence of double tracks in that
portion of Lexington street, lying between North and Charles
streets, would be inconsistent with the reasonable use of the
street at that point by the public and by other vehicles; that
the street was so narrow as to leave but just sufficient room
between the curb and the railroad tracks for ordinary vehicles
to pass, and that those which were of extra width could not
meet or pass a car on the same side of the street; that the
street was one of the main thoroughfares running east and
west in the city of Baltimore; that at certain portions of
the day it was crowded with vehicles of all descriptions, and

that to permit the use of the street at the point in question by
this company, with its electric cars running at a comparatively
high rate of speed and with double tracks laid in the street,
would prevent the reasonable use of the same by the public,
and would be dangerous in the extreme and directly tend to
loss of life and injury to property.
As to the matter of convenience to the public and of necessity to the company, the latter asserted it would, in fact,
accommodate the public more to have double tracks than
a single one, while it was a real necessity to the company
in order that it might, by giving accommodation to the public, impossible with a single track, successfully compete with
rival roads running through adjacent streets for a fair share
of patronage; that it could not do so, if it had but a single
track for eleven hundred feet on Lexington street.
Upon these facts the case was heard in the court below, and
that court held that ordinance No. 23, upon its acceptance by the
railroad company, became a contract between the city and the
railroad company, which could not be substantially modified
without the consent of both parties, and that the subsequent ordinance was a violation of that contract and therefore invalid,
and a judgment was ordered enjoining the city authorities from
interfering with the railroad company in the construction and
maintenance of two parallel tracks on Lexington street, and
from interfering in any manner with the company in the operation of its electric cars over and upon such tracks, provided the
two tracks are laid and maintained and the cars operated in conformity with the provisions of ordinance No. 23, and in conformity with the general regulations of the mayor and common
council of Baltimore relating to the construction and operation
of such street railways, not inconsistdnt with the provisions of
ordinance No. 23, above mentioned. From this decree, Judge
Morris, -District Judge in the district of Maryland, dissented.

Opinion of the Court.

Xir. John iv. Steele and Mr. John E. Semmes were on their
brief.
MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after stating the facts, delivered the
opinion of the court.

The discussion on the argument of this case took quite a
wide range, but in the view we take, we can dispose of this
appeal without deciding whether the common council had or
had not the power to make a contract for the perpetual use
of its streets by the railroad company, upon the terms and
conditions which might be agreed upon between the common
council and the railroad company, and which when once
agreed upon should not be thereafter subject to repeal or
material alteration by the common council. It is sufficient for
the decision of this case to hold that the direction to lay but
one track through Lexington street, between the points mentioned, did not substantially change the terms of the contract,
and was no more than the exercise by the city of its acknowledged power to make a reasonable regulation concerning the
use of that street by the railroad company and that the
original contract (assuming that one existed) was entered
into subject to the right of the city to adopt such a regulation.
Chapter 370 of the act of 1890, referred to in the foregoing
statement of facts, distinctly granted to the mayor and city
cQuncil of Baltimore the power to regulate the use of the
streets by railway companies. In the absence of any such
positive legislation, we think there could be no well founded
doubt of this power, and that any contract entered into by
the city with a railroad company would be subject to its
exercise, so long as it did not materially modify or impair the
rights granted by the contract. Indeed, no question is made
of the existence of a power of regulation by any party to this
suit. It was not denied by the court below. The only dispute on this branch of the case between the parties is in
regard to the question whether the direction to lay but a
single track on Lexington street, between the points men-

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

tioned, is or is not a reasonable regulation of the use of that
street to which the contract was subjected, as above stated.
We are not now concerned with the question of the right of
the common council absolutely or unconditionally to repeal
ordinance No. 23, but simply as to whether the passage of the
subsequent ordinance amounted to a valid regulation of the
use of the street by the railroad company. We think that
the later ordinance, although the word "repeal" was used in
its first section, was in substance a regulation of the use of the
street which the city had the power to enact. The effect of
the whole ordinance was simply to change the right of the
company to operate its road on Lexington street for eleven
hundred feet, so that instead of using double tracks *Itshould
have in that street but a single track.
There is sufficient in the case before us from which it may
be seen that the laying down of double tracks in some portion
of the street in question was done with the knowledge that it
was against the wishes of the mayor and the city authorities,
and in spite of the notification by them to the company that
immediate measures would be taken to have ordinance No. 23
so altered by the common council at its first session as to provide for the laying of but one track instead of double tracks
between North and Calvert streets on Lexington street. Notwithstanding such notice the company proceeded by working
night and day to lay down the double tracks in Lexington
street between the points last named. In looking at the question, therefore, of the reasonableness of the ordinance which
made no provision for payment by the city of the expense of
taking up one track and relocating the other along Lexington
street, but which on the contrary provided that it should be
done at the expense of the railroad company, it is proper that
we should view the case as if the proposed regulation had
been passed before the company had laid any track on Lexington street, between North and Calvert streets, and before it
had been put to any expense on account of such double track.
We cannot say the regulation was unreasonable simply on the
ground that it did not provide for paying the expense of taking up one track already laid in the street between Calvert

Opinion of the Court.

and Charles streets (a distance of a few hundred feet), to the

laying of which the city had not, at the time, objected. Having at one time granted the right to the company to lay double
tracks through certain named streets of the city of Baltimore,
was it a reasonable regulation of the use of one of those streets
to thereafter, and before the completion and operation of the
road therein, provide that but a single track in that street should
be used instead of the double tracks which had been first provided for?
Upon the facts already set forth a sufficient foundation was
laid for the exercise of a fair and reasonable legislative discretion in determining the question whether the portion of the
street mentioned should be occupied by a single or double
track of the railway company. A regulation of that portion
of the street by subjecting it to the use of but one instead of
double railway tracks did not (in our judgment) thereby
materially modify nor did it, in effect, prohibit the exercise
of the privileges previously granted by the city to the railroad company, nor did it impair the obligation of the contract or destroy vested rights, nor was this regulation substantially inconsistent with the terms of ordinance No. 23. While
that ordinance provided generally for double tracks through
the streets mentioned therein, the reduction of the right to
use two tracks and the granting of the right to use but one
for such a comparatively short distance in one particularly
crowded and narrow thoroughfare was not a regulation inconsistent with the terms of the original ordinance. It would, we
think, be unreasonable to hold that the least limitation of the
power to operate double tracks was an infringement and impairment of the contract as set forth in the ordinance. In our
opinion, the ordinance does not give any such cast iron right

or one which shall be beyond any reasonable limitation and
supervision by the city. It granted the use of the streets for
double tracks for many miles, and the subsequent limitattion
of that use to one track related to but a,few hundred feet
where peculiar and exceptional conditions existed, where the
danger to be apprehended from the use of electric cars on
double tracks in a narrow and busy thoroughfare was very

Opinion of the Court.

great, and where it might fairly be decided by the common
council that double tracks at that point would be an unreasonable and dangerous use of the street by the company
and directly tend to prevent its reasonable and safe use and
enjoyment by the public at large.
In St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 149 U. S. 465,
469, Mr. Justice Brewer, in delivering the opinion of the court
in regard to the power of regulation of the streets of a city,
said:
"It is given power to open and establish streets, to improve
them as it sees fit, and to regulate their use, paying for all
this out of its own funds. The word 'regulate' is one of
broad import. It is the word used in the Federal Constitution
to define the power of Congress over foreign and interstate
commerce, and he who reads the many opiiions of this court
will perceive how broad and comprehensive it has been held
to be. If the city gives a right to the use of the streets or
public grounds, as it did by ordinance No. 11,604, it simply.
regulates the use when it prescribes the terms and conditions
upon which they shall be used. If it should see fit to construct an expensive boulevard in the city, and then. limit the
use to vehicles of a certain kind, or exact a toll from all who
use it, would that be other than a regulation of the use? And
so it is only a matter of regulation of use when the city grants
to the telegraph company the right to use exclusively a portion of the street, on condition of contributing something
towards the expense it has been put to in opening and improving the street."
To same effect, see Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania,
114 U. S. 196, 203: "The power to regulate commerce," says
Mr. Justice Field, speaking for this court, " is the power to
prescribe the rules by which it shall be governed, that is, the
conditions upon which it shall be conducted."
If it be said in this case that the city had already regulated
the use by prescribing that there should be two tracks, the
answer is that this power of regulation is a continuing power;
it is not exhausted by being once exercised, and so long as the
object is plainly one of regulation, the power may be exercised

as often as and whenever the common council may think
proper; the use of the street may be subjected to one condition to-day and to another and additional one to-morrow,
provided the power is exercised in good faith and the condition imposed is appropriate as a reasonable regulation, and
is not imposed arbitrarily or capriciously. New Orleans Gas
Co. v. Louisiana Light Co., 115 U. S. 650, 672; N. Y. &
X. E. Railroad v. Bristol, 151 U. S. 556, 567.
The effect of the third section of the latter ordinance was to
leave with the railroad company the power to lay down and
maintain and use one track instead of double tracks on Lexington street between the streets named. It is true the city
assumed to attach a condition to the exercise of this right,
which was that the railroad company should within twenty
days remove the double tracks and replace the pavement. In
view of all the facts, we should incline to regard this as in the
nature of a penalty to secure obedience of the company to the
regulation, and in any event, in the light of the conduct of
the parties in relation to the litigation in.the state court, we
think the railroad company has not lost the right to maintain
one track in the street in question as it now exists, without
the adoption of any further ordinance on the subject.
On the ground which we have stated, we think the decree
of the Circuit Court wrong, and for that reason it must be
Reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.
