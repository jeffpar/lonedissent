OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Statement of the Case.

cannot find any evidence which justifies us in believing that
a legal grant can have been made, and under those circumstances we cannot consider possession since the date of the
treaty as dispensing with the requirement that the title, if
not perfect at that time, was one which the claimant would
have had a lawful right to make perfect, had the territory
not been acquired by the United States.
In the view we have taken of this case, it becomes unnecessary to consider whether Governor Armijo had power or
authority to make a grant of public lands without the assent
of the territorial deputation or departmental assembly.
The judgment of the pourt below must therefore be
Affirmed.

BOLLES v. OUTING COM[PANY.
ERROR TO CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND

No. 47. Submitted October 16, 1899.

-Decided

CIRCUIT.

December4, 1S99.

In an action under Rev. Stat. ยง 4965 to recover a penalty of one dollar for
every copy of an engraving or photograph infringing the copyright of
another, the plaintiff's recovery is limited to copies actually found in the
possession of the defendant, and does not extend to copies already sold
and put in circulation.
A party who does not take out a writ of error will not be heard to complain
of adverse rulings in the court below.

THIS was .an action begun April 18, 1894, by Charles E.
Bolles, a resident of the city of Brooklyn, New Yoik, for the
penalty provided for the infringement of the copyright of a
photograph, by Rev. Stat. see. 4965. This section enacts that
"if any person, after the recording of the title of any map,
chart, musical composition, print, cut, engraving or 2 hotogravh,
as provided by this chapter, shall, within the time
limited, and without the consent of the proprietor of the
copyright first obtained in writing, signed in presence of two
or more witnesses, engrave, etch, work, copy, print, publish

shall sell or

expose to sale, any copy of such map or other article, as aforesaid, he shall forfeit to the proprietor all the plates on which the
same shall be copied, and every sheet thereof, either copied or
printed, and shall further forfeit one dollar for every sheet of
the same found in hisyossession," etc.
In August, 1893, plaintiff made a photograph of the yacht
"Vigilant" under full sail, and copyrighted the same under
the title "Vigilant, No. 4." The copyright stamp on the'photograph was made by impressing at the lower end of the right-'
hand corner of the photographs the words "Copyright 93, by.
Bolles, Brooklyn," Bolles being the trademark name used by
the plaintiff.
Defendant made a photogravure of this photograph, and published it November, 1893, in a magazine published by itin New
York known by the name of "The Outing." Defendant had
no permission to use or copy the photograph.
One copy of this number of The Outing was purchased of
the defendant by an employ6 of the plaintiff for the sum of
twenty-five cents.
On the first trial in the Circuit Court the action was dismissed upon the ground that the copyright stamp on the photograph was insufficient notice of the copyright, because the
year was not given in full, nor the full name of the owner.
Thereupon plaintiff sued out a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the copyright stamp
was sufficient, but sustained the trial court in its exclusion of
certain evidence offered sto the number of copies found in
the possession of the defendant. 77 Fed. Rep. 966.
Upon the new trial the same evidence as to the number of
copie of the infringement found in the possession of the
defendant was excluded, and a verdict directed for plaintiff
for one dollar penalty for the one copy bought by plaintiff's
employA from the defendant. Plaintiff moved for a new trial
because of -the refusal of the court to permit him to prove the
the number-of copies which had been in the defendant's possession at any time within the two years previous to the comrpencement of the suit. Upon his motion being denied, he

again- sued out a writ of error -from the Circuit Court of
Appeals, which affirmed the judgment. Whereupon plaintiff
sued out a writ of error from this court.
.Mr.George E. Taldo for plaintiff in error.
XM.John _R. Abney for defendant in error.
MR. JusTicE BRowN, after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
Whether .the court erred in excluding the evidence offered
by the plaintiff tending to show the number of copies of the
issue of The Outing, containing a reproduction of the plaintiff's photograph, which had been printed and delivered to the
defendant at any time within two years prior .to the commencement of this action, is the sole question presented by
the assignments of error.
This is an action to recover a penalty of one dollar for every
copy of the plaintiff's photograph, and is based upon Revised
Statutes, section 4965, which declares that any person offending against its provisions " shall forfeit to the proprietor all the
plates on which the same shall be copied, and every sheet
thereof, either copied or printed, and shall further forfeit one
dollar for every sheet of the same found in his possession, either
printing, printed, copied, published, imported or exposed for
sale,

.

one half thereof to the proprietor and the other

half to the use of the United States." This is clearly a penal
statute in that it fixes a single and arbitrary measure of recompense to the plaintiff, irrespective of the damages actually sustained by him, or of the profits realizbd by the defendant; and
in the further provision that one half of the amount recovered
shall be to the use of the United States. It makes no pretence
of awarding damages, and simply imposes a forfeiture of a specified sum. In this respect it differs-wholly from the following
section (4966) recently considered by us in Brady v. Daly, ante,
148, which made a person performing or representing any copyrighted dramatic composition "liable for damages therefor,

. .. to be assessed at uch sum, not less than $100 for the
first and $50 for every subsequent performance, as to the couit
shall appear to be just." There the award was of damages, and-a
minimum sum was fixed apparently to cover cases where it was.
impossible to estimate such damages; but there was no limit
to the amount which might be awarded if, in the opinion of the
court, it were just to increase the minimum. The idea suggested by the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the
court, that as it would be difficult to prove the exact amount
of damages suffered by reason of the unlawful representation,
the statute provided a minimum sum, leaving it open for a
larger recovery upon proof of greater damages, hs no application to the section under consideration, where the plaintiff can
recover no greater nor less damages than the penalty provided
by the section. The penal character of the act is further
emphasized by the fact that the plaintiff apparently recovers
a moiety for the use of the United States, though perhaps this
is not beyond a doubt suggested in Thornton v. Schreiber, 124
U. S: 612. The act of 1831, for which this act is a substitute,
and of the sixth section, of which sectiofi 4965 is a substantial
copy, was said by this court in Backus v. Gould, 7 How. 798,
811, to give a qui tam action for the sum forfeited.
The statute, then, being penal, must be construed with such
strictness as to carefully safeguard the rights of the defendant
and at the same time preserve the obvious intention of the leg-.
islature. If the language be plain, it will be construed as it
reads, and the words of the statute given their full meaning;
if ambiguous, the court will lean more strongly in favor of the
defendant than it would if the statute were remedial. In both cases it will endeavor to effect substantial justice. UnitedStates

76, 95; American Fur Co.v. United &ate, 2 Pet. 358; United
States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214.
The language of this section when examined seems hardly
susceptible of two interpretations, unless certain words which
are not found there are treated as interpolated. "Itforfeits
to the proprietbr of the pirated publication all the plates on
which the same shall be copied, and every sheet thereof, either

copied or printed, and shall further forfeit one dollar for every
-sheet of the same found in his "possession. No remedy is
provided by the act, although by section 4970 a bill in equity
will lie for an injunction; but the provision for a forfeiture of
the plates and of the copies seems to contemplate an action
in the nature of replevin for their seizure, and in addition to
the confiscation of the copies, for a recovery of one dollar for
every copy so seized or found in the possession of the defendant. While the forfeiture is not limited as to the number
of the copies, it is limited to such as are found in, and not
simply traced to, the possession of the defendant. Congress
may have been perfectly willing to impose a forfeiture of one
dollar for every such copy, and have been reluctant to impose
it upon the thousands of such copies that may.have previously,
been put in circulation. The construction contended for would
permit an author to lie by during the two years allowed him
for bringing suit, permit another to publish the work during
that time, and then recover for every copy so published.
Not only this, but as the penalty is imposed upon any person who engraves, copies, prints, publishes or sells a copy, not
"only the publisher, but the printer and bookseller might be
liable for every copy' traced to his possession. Indeed, the
defendant might be made liable for every copy traced to his
possession, even though he destroyed the whole edition for
the purpose of relieving himself from the penalty.
This case is clearly controlled by that of Backus v. Gould,
7 How. 798. This was an action of debt brought by Gould
and Banks to recover penalties incurred by the invasion of
plaintiffs' copyright in twelve volumes of law reports. Defendant insisted that plaintiff could only recover for such sheets
as were proved to have been found in his possession, either
printing or printed, published or exposed for sale. Plaintiffs
insisted, as the plaintiff does here, that they were entitled to
recover for every sheet which had been published, or procured
to be published, by the defendant, whether the same were
proved to have been found in the defendant's possession or
hot. The language of the forfeiting clause, section six of
the act of February 3, 1831, c. 16, 4 Stat. 436, 437, was that

BOLLES v. OUTING COMPANY.
Opinion of the Court.

"such offender shall forfeit every copy of such book to the
person legall, at the time, entitled to the copyright thereof;
and shall also forfeit and pay fifty cents. for every such sheet
which may be found in his possession,

.

.

.

one moiety

thereof to such legal owner of the copyright aforesaid, and
the other to the Uffited States." The recovery was held to
be limited to the sheets in the possession of the defendant,
and an instruction that he was liable for every sheet which
he had published, or- procured to be published, was held to be
erroneous.
That case was decided in 1849, and must be regarded as
overruling anything to be found to the contrary in Reed v.
Garusi, Taney Dec. 72;
C.a, 20 Fed. Cases, 431, decided by
Chief Justice Taney in 1845; -Dwight v. Apeton, 8 Fed.
Cases, 143, decided in 1843, and .Millett v. Snowde, 17 Fed.
Cases, 374, decided in 1844.
The case of Thornton v. Schreiber, 124 U. S. 612, was a
qui tam action brought against Thornton under section 4965
for the unlawful reproduction of a certain copyrighted photograph. The case turned upon the fact whether the sheets
were found in the possession of the defendant. They were
actually found in the store of Sharpless & Sons, wholesale
dealers in dry goods, were used by pasting them. upon parcels of dry goods, and were their property. Thornton was
employed for the purchase. of goods sold by the firm, and he
appears to have gotten up the plate, ordered fifteeih thousand
copies to be made, which were subsequently delivered to
Sharpless & Sons, who paid for them. Attempt was made
to establish the fact that Thornton had the possession of these
prints, by showing that he was the man who first conceived
the idea of getting them up and using them in the business
of the firm. It was held that Thornt6n could not be considered to have held possession of them, but that an action of
replevin could have been sustained against the firm, and that
they were the proper parties to be. made defendants. The
same argument was made as in Backus v. Gould, that .the
words, "found in his possession," meant simply that, where
the sheets are ascertained by the finding of the jury to have

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

been at any time in the possession of the defendant, the forfeiture attached; but it was held that the only possession
defendant had was that of Sharpless & Sons, and that he held
them merely as their employ6, subject always to their order
and control. While Backus v. Gould is not cited in the opinion, the case is a distinct affirmance of that. See also Sarony
v. Fhrioh, 28 Fed. Rep. 79.
Hdd Congress designed the extended meaning claimed for
these words "found in his possession," it would naturally have
used the expression "found or traced to his possession," or
"found to be, or to have been, in his possession." It is only
by interpolating words of this purport that the statute can
receive the construction claimed. We concur with the learned
judge who spoke for the Court of Appeals that the words
"found in his possession" aptly refer to a finding for the purposes of forfeiture and condemnation. "The remedy by forfeiture and condemnation is only appropriate in a case where
the property can be seized upon process, and where, as here,
the forfeiture declared is against property of the ' offender' is
only appropriate when it can be seized in his hands."
Two other defences are interposed which go to the recov:
ery of even the small judgment of one dollar and costs, and
which, if sustained, would require the judgment of the court
below to be reversed, and ultimately a verdict for the defendant. First, that the notice of the copyright, imprinted on the
photograph, did not fill the requirements of the statute; and,
second, that the copyright claimed by Bolles is not sanctioned
by the Constitution. It is sufficient to say of these that the
defendant did not take out a writ of error, and cannot now be
heard to complain of any adverse rulings in the court below.
