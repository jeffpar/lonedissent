THE PEDRO.
PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA.
No. 115. Argued November 2, 8,1899. -Decided December 11, 1899.
On the 20th of April, 1898, a joint resolution of Congress was approved by
the President declaring that the people of Cuba are, and of right ought
to be, free and independent. On the same day the Minister of Spain at
Washington demanded his passport, and the diplomatic relations of Spain
with the United States were terminated. On the 22d of the same April a
blockade of a part of the coast of Cuba was instituted. On the 23d of
the same month, in a proclamation of the Queen Regent of Spain it was
declared that a state of war was existing between Spain and the United
States. On the 26th of the same month the President issued a proclamation, declaring that a state of- war existed between the United States and
Spain, the fourth and fifth articles of which proclamation were as follows:
"4. Spanish merchant vessels in any ports or places within the United
States shall be allowed till May 21, 1898, inclusive, for loading their cargoes and departing from such ports or places; and such Spanish merdhant vessels, if met at sea by any United States ship shall be permitted
to continue their voyage if, on examination of their papers, it shall appear
that their cargoes were taken on board before the expiration of the above
term; Provided, that nothing herein contained shall apply to the Spanish
vessels having on board any officers in the military or naval service of the
enemy, or any coal (except such as may be necessary for their voyage),
or any other article prohibited or contraband of war, or any dispatch of
or to the Spanish Government."
"5. Any Spanish merchant vessel
which, prior to April 21, 1898, shall have sailed from any'foreign port
bound for any port or place in the United States, shall be permitted to
enter such port or place and to discharge her cargo, and afterwards
forthwith to depart without molestation; and any such vessel, If met at

sea by any Uuitvd States ship, sbh4 be pelmitted to coutinlie hvr .oy,

age to any port not blockaded." The Pedro was built in England, sailed
under the British flag till 1887, and then was transferred to a Spanish
corporation, and sailed under the Spanish flag. Sailing from Antwerp
she arrived at Havana with a cargo April 17, 1898.
She remained
there five days, discharged her cargo and left for Santiago April 22.
At 6 o'clock on that evening, when about 15 miles east of the Morro, and
5 miles north of the Cuban coast, she was captured by the New York, of
the blockading fleet, sent to Key West, and there libelled and condemned.
.Meld,
(1) That the language of the proclamation was plain, and not open to
interpretation;
(2) That the Pedro did not come within Article 4 of the proclamation;
nor within Article 5 ; nor within the reasons usually assigned for
exemption from capture;
(3) That it must be assumed that she was advised of the strained relations between the United States and Spain;
(4) That being owned by a Spanish corporation, having a Spanish registry, and sailing under a Spanish flag and a Spanish license, and
being officered and manned by Spaniards, she must be deemed to
be a Spanish ship, although'she was insured against risks of war
by British underwriters - that fact being immaterial.

Tnis was an appeal from a 'decree of the District Court of
the United States for the Southern District of Florida condemning the steamer Pedro as lawful prize of war on a libel
filed April 23, 1898.
April 20, 1898, the President approved the following joint
resolution :
"First. That the people of the Island of 'Cuba are, and of
right ought to be, free and independent.
"Second. That it is the duty of the United States to
demand, and the Government of the United States does hereby
demand, that the Government of Spain at once relinquish its
authority and government in the Island of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
"Third. That the President of the United States be, and
he hereby is, directed and empowered to use the entire land
and naval forces of the United .States, and to call into the
actual service of the United StateÂ§ the militia of the several
States, to such extent as may 'e necessary to carry .these resolutions into effect.
"Fourth, That the United States hereby disclaims any dis-

position or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or
control over said Island except for the pacification thereof, and
asserts its determination, when that is accomplished, to leave
the government and control of the Island to its people." 30
Stat. 738.
On the same day, the Minister of Spain to the United States
requested and obtained his passports; the text of the resolution was cabled to the Minister of theiUnited States at Madrid;
and the Secretary of State by separate dispatch directed him
to communicate the resolution to the Government of Spain
with the formal demand of the United States therein made,
and the notification that, in the absence of a response by
April 23, the President would proceed without further notice
to use the power and authority enjoined and conferred upon
him.
April 21, the Minister of the United States at Madrid
acknowledged the receipt of the Secretary's dispatch that
morning, but saying that before he had communicated it he
had been notified by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain
that diplomatic relations were broken off between the two
countries, and that he had accordingly asked for his passports.
The letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain
referred to was as- follows:
"In compliance with a painful duty I have the honor to
inform Your Excellency that the President having approved
a resolution of both Chambers of the United States, which in
denying the legitimate sovereignty of Spain and threatening
an immediate armed intervention in Cuba, is equivalent to an
evident declaration of war, the Government of His Majesty
has ordered its Minister in Washington to withdraw without
loss of time from the North American territory, with all the
personnel of the Legation. By this act the diplomatic relations which previously existed between the two countries .are
broken off, all official communications between their respective
representatives ceasing, and I hasten to communicate this to
Your Excellency in order that on your part you may make
such dispositions as seem suitable. I beg Your Excellency to
acknowledge the receipt of this note at such time as you deem

Statement of the Case.

proper, and I avail myself of this opportunity to reiterate to
you the assurances of my distinguished consideration."
The Secretary of the Navy at once gave instructions to the
commander in chief of the North Atlantic Squadron to "immediately institute a blockade of the North coast of Cuba,
extending from Cardenas on the east to Bahia Honda on the
west; also, if in your opinion your force warrants, the port
of Cienfuegos, on the south side of the island.

.

.

.

It is

believed that this blockade will cut off Havana almost entirely
from receiving supplies from the outside.

.

.

. The De-

partment does not wish the defences of Havana to be bombarded or attacked by your squadron."
April 22, Admiral Sampson, in command, instituted the
blockade and on that day the President issued the following
proclamation:
"Whereas, by a joint resolution passed by the Congress
and approved April 20, 1898, and communicated to the
Government of Spain, it was demanded that said Government at once relinquish its authority and government in the
Island of Cuba, and withdraw its land and naval forces from
Cuba and Cuban waters; and the President of the United
States was directed and empowered to use the entire land and
naval forces of the United States, and to call. into the actual
service of the United States the militia of the several States
to such extent as might be necessary to carry said resolution
into effect; and
"Whereas, in carrying, into effect said resolution, the President of the United States deems it necessary to set on foot
and maintain a blockade of th6 North coast of Cuba, including all ports on said coast between Cardenas and Bahia
Honda and the port of Cienfuegos on the South coast of
Cuba:
"Now, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the
United States, in order to enforce the said resolution, do
hereby declare and proclaim that the United States of America have instituted, and will maintain a blockade of the North
coast of Cuba, including ports on said coast between Cardenas and Bahia Honda and the port of Cienfuegos on the

South coast of Cuba, aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws of
the United States and the law of nations applicable to such
cases. An efficient force will be posted so as to prevent the
entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid. Any
neutral vessel approaching any of said ports, or attempting
to leave the same, without notice or knowledge of the establishment of such blockade, will be duly warned by the Commander of the blockading forces, who will indorse on her
register the fact, and the date, of such warning, where such
indorsement was made; and if the same vessel shall again
attempt to enter any blockaded port, she will be captured
and sent to the nearest convenient port for such proceedings
against her and her cargo as prize, as may be deemed advisable.
"Neutral vessels lying in any of said ports at the time of
the establishment of such blockade will be allowed thirty days
to issue therefrom." 30 Stat. 1769.
April 23 the Queen Regent of Spain issued a decree, in
which, among other things, it was stated:
"Article I. The state of war existing between Spain and
the United States terminates the treaty of peace and friendship of the 27th October, 1795, the protocol of the 12th Janunary, 1877, and all other agreements, compacts and conventions
that have been in force up to the present between the two
countries.
"Art. II. A term of fiue days from the date of the publication of the present royal decree in the Madrid Gazette is
allowed to all United States ships anchored in Spanish ports,
during which they are at liberty to depart."
April 25, in response to a message from the President,
Congress passed the following act, which was thereupon duly
and at once approved:
"First. That war be, and the same is hereby, declared to
exist, and that war has existed since the twenty-first day of
April, Anno Domini eighteen hundred and ninety-eight,
including said day, between the United States of America
and the Kingdom of Spain.
"Second. That the President of the United States be, and

he hereby is, directed and empowered to use the entire land
and naval forces of the United States, and to call into the
actual service of the United States the militia of the several
States, to such extent as may be necessary to carry this act
into effect." 30 Stat. 364.
April 26 the President issued a further proclamation, as follows:
"Whereas, By an act of Congress, approved April 25, 1898,
it is declared that war exists, and that war has existed since
the 21st day of April, A.D. 1898, including said day, between.
the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain;
and
"Whereas, It being desirable that such war should be conducted upon principles in harmony with the present views of
nations and sanctioned by their recent practic:, it has already
been announced that the policy of this Government will be
not to resort to privateering, but to adhere to the rules of the
declaration of Paris:
"CNow, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the
United States of America, by virtue of the power vested in me
by the Constitution and the laws, do hereby declare and proclaim:
"1. The neutral flag covers enemy's goods, with the exception of contraband of war.
"2. Neutral goods, not contraband of war, are not liable to
confiscation under the enemy's flag.
"3. Blockades in order to be binding must be effective.
"14. Spatish merchant vessels, in any ports or places within
the United States, shall be allowed till May 21, 1898, inclusive,
for loading their cargoes and departing from such ports or
places; and such Spanish merchant vessels, if met at sea, by
any United States ship, shall be permitted to continue their
voyage, if, on examination of their papers, it shall appear that
their cargoes were taken on board before the expiration of the
above term; Provided, that nothing herein contained shall
apply to Spanish vessels having on board any officer in the
military or naval service of the enemy, or any coal (except
such as may be necessary for the.voyage), or any other article

prohibited or contraband of war, or any dispatch of or to the
Spanish Government.
"5. Any Spanish merchant vessel which, prior to April 21,
1898, shall have sailed from any foreign port bound for any
port or place in the United States, shall be permitted to enter
such port or place, and to discharge her cargo, and afterwards
forthwith to depart without molestation; and any such vessel,
if met at sea by any United States ship, shall be permitted to
continue her voyage to any port not blockaded.
"6. The right of search is to be exercised with strict regard
for the rights of neutrals, and the voyages of mail steamers
are not to be interfered with except on the clearest grounds of
suspicion of a violation of law in resnect of contraband or
blockade." 30 Stat. 1770.
The steamship Pedro was built at lNewcastle, England, in
1883, and, until 1887, sailed under British regis.try and the
name of Lilburn Tower. In the latter year her name was
changed to The Pedro, and she was transferred to La Compaiia La Flecha, a Spanish corporation of Bilboa, Spain, and
registered at that port in its name, and on October 4, 1881,
obtained a royal patent from the Crown of Spain, which was
issued to her as the property of the company. Thereafter she
sailed under the Spanish flag and was officered and manned by
Spaniards, though she was engaged in the transportation of
cargo for hire as a merchant vessel under the management of
G. H. Fletcher and Company of Liverpool. Her voyages
began in Europe where she took cargo for Cuban ports, from
which ports on discharge she proceeded to ports of the United
States, where she took cargo for a port of discharge in Europe,
the round trip occupying about three months. Between March
20 and March 25, 1898, she took on board at Antwerp, Belgium, some 2000 tons of cargo for Havana, Santiago de Cuba,
and Cienfuegos, Cuba, of which 1700 tons was rice and the
rest, hardware, empty bottles, paper, cement and general
cargo.
On March 18, 1898, she was chartered to the firm of Keyser
and Company, being described in the charter party as "now
loading in Antwerp for Cuba," to proceed to Pensacola, Flor-

Statement of the Case.

ida, or Ship Island, Mississippi, "with all convenient speed,"
to load a cargo of lumber for Rotterdam or Antwerp. The
charter party provided that "should the vessel not be in all
respects ready for cargo at her loading place on or before the
18th of May, 1898, charterers or their agents have the option
of cancelling this charter. If required by charterers, lay days
are not to commence at loading port before the 5th of May,
1898." Among the ship's papers was a bill of health issued
by the consul of the United States at Antwerp, March 24,
which described her as "engaged in Atlantic trade, and plies
between Antwerp, Cuba and the United States." The bill of
health concluded as follows: "I certify that the vessel has
complied with the rules and regulations made under the act
of February 15, 1893, and that the vessel leaves this port bound
for Pensacola, in the United States of America, via Havana,
Santiago & Cienfuegos.". The steamer's freight list on the
voyage to Cuban ports was valued at about $7'OO, stated to
be barely sufficient to cover the expenses of receiving, transporting and delivering that cargo and the charter hire on the
contemplated voyage from Pensacola or Ship Island to Rotterdam would have been about $25,000.
The steamer arrived at Havana on April 17, and remained
there for five days, discharging about sixteen hundred tons of
her cargo, and taking on some twenty tons of general merchandise for Santiago. On April 22, at about half after three
o'clock in the afternoon, she-left Havana for Santiago, and at
six o'clock, when about fifteen miles east of the Morro, at the
entrance of Havana harbor, and five miles north of the Cuban
coast, was captured by the cruiser New York, one of the blockading fleet, and sent to Key West in charge of a prize crew.
There she was libelled on April 23.
In due course, proofs in preparatorio,which embraced the
ship's papers and.the depositions of her master and first officer,
were taken. The master appeared in behalf of the owners and
made claim to the vessel, and moved the court for leave to
take further proofs, presenting with the motion his test affidavit. In the affidavit it was alleged that, although a majority of the stock of La Compafia La Flecha was registered in

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Counsel for Parties.

the names of Spanish subjects and only a minority in the
names of British subjects, (members of the firm of G. RI.
Fletcher and Company,) one of the latter had possession of
all the certificates of stock, which under the charter of the
company established the ownership thereof, whereby he was
the "sole beneficial owner of the said steamer Pedro." And
further that the steamer was transferred from the British to
the Spanish registry solely for commercial reasons, "there
being discriminations in favor of vessels carrying the Spanish flag in respect of commerce with the colonies of Spain,
in consideration of dues paid by such steamers to the government of Spain," but hat it was the intention of the British
stockholders to withdraw her from the Spanish registry and
from under the Spanish flag, and restore her to the British
registry and the flag of Great Britain whenever the trade
might be disturbed. It was also alleged that the steamer
was insured "against all perils and adventures, including the
risks of war, for her full value by underwriters of Lloyds,
London, and by insurance companies organized and existing
under and pursuant to the laws of Great Britain, and that if
the said vessel should be condemned as prize by this court
the loss will rest upon and be borne by the said English
underwriters."

The motion was denied, the cause heard on the pleadings
and the proofs taken injvreparatorio,and a decree of condemnation entered.
Subsequently the Secretary of the Navy
elected to take the vessel for the use of the United States
pursuant to section 4624 of the Revised Statutes. By order
of court she was duly appraised and delivered to the Navy
Department, and the amount of her appraised value deposited
with the Assistant Treasurer of the United States at New
York, subject to the order of the District Court. From the
decree of condemnation an appeal was prosecuted to this
court.

THE PEDRO.
Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Eoyt filed a brief for the
United States.
Mm. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the
court.
When, on the twenty-second day. of April, this Spanish
steamer sailed from Havana, the United States and Spain
were at war. Congress had adopted a resolution, April 20,
demanding "that the Government of Spain at once relinquish
its authority and government in the Island of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from' Cuba and Cuban waters,"
and directing and empowering the President "to use the
entire land and naval forces of the United States, and to call
into the actual service of the United States the militia of the
several States, to such extent as may be necessary to carry
these resolutions into effect." Time was given by the Executive until April 23 for Spain to signify compliance with. the
demand, but the Spanish Government at once, on April 21,
recognized the resolution. as "an evident declaration of war,"
and diplomatic relations were broken off. Blockade had been
proclaimed April 22, and put into effective operation at
Havana, and, immediately thereupon, elsewhere, under the
proclamation. And by the act of Congress of April 25, it
was declared that war had existed since the twenty-first day
of April.
,Being an enemy's vessel, the Pedro was liable to capture as
lawful prizie unless exempted therefrom by the terms of the
proclamation of April 26. If that document in its bearing on
this case could be regarded as ambiguous, a liberal constructibn might be indulged in, and it is urged that such liberality
should in any event be accorded in view. of the traditional
policy of this Government in respect of the exemption of private property at sea during war.
In The Pkcnix, 1 Spinks Eccl. & Adm. Rep. 306, 310;
Spinks' Prize Cases, 1, 6, Dr. Lushington said in reference to
the relaxation of belligerent rights by official action "If the
words of the documenl are capable of two constructions, then

OCTOBER TER-M, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

I am clearly of opinion that the one most favorable to the
belligerent party, in whose favor the document is issued,
ought to be adopted; but the court must bear in mind that
its province is notjus dare, but jus dicere; and I must again
refer to the principle which I have often enunciated in this
court, verbis plane expressis omnino standum est."
As applicable here, the meaning of the language used
appears to us plain, and the proclamation not open to interpretation, since none is needed; nor are we justified in
expanding executive action by construction because of the
diplomatic attitude of this Government in respect of the
exemption of all property, not contraband, of citizens and
subjects of nations at war with each other, an exemption
which has not as yet been adopted into the law of nations.
It may be that the hardships incident to the contrary view
will finally be found so destitute of corresponding advantage
as to lead to the general acceptance of the doctrine so long
unsuccessfully advocated by our statesmen and publicists, in
diminution of the evils of war, but we must apply the law as
it is, and not the law as they have contended it should be.
The Pedro did not come within the fourth article of the proclamation, for she waÂ§ in Havana, 'a port of the enemy, on
April 21, and not "in any port or place within the United
States." She sailed from Havana for Santiago, another port
of the enemy, on April 22, was captured that day, and reached
Key West on April 23 as a prize of war. The suggestion that
she was thus brought within the exemption requires no remark.
Nor did the fifth article of the proclamation exempt the
Pedro. That article provided that "any Spanish merchant
vessel which, prior to April 21, 1898, shall have sailed from
any foreign port bound for any port or place in the United
States, shall be permitted to enter such port or place and to
discharge her cargo, and afterwards forthwith to depart without molestation."
The Pedro remained in the harbor of Havana from the 17th
until the 22d of April. We think it must be assumed that she
was advised of the strained relations between the United States
and Spain, and the imminency of hostilities. At all events,

THE PEDRO.
Opinion of the Court.

she did not leave Havana until the day after that designated
by Congress and the President as the day on which war
actually began, and which was also so regarded by the
Government of Spain. She had no cargo to be discharged
at any port or place in the United States, but had cargo for
Santiago and Cienfuegos, Cuban ports held by the Spanish
forces, and she cleared, not for Pensacola, but for Santiago.
She was not within the letter of the proclamation, nor within
the reasons usually assigned for the exemption as pointed out in
the opinion of the District Judge, 87 Fed. Rep. 927. She had
not lefta foreign port in ignorance of the perilous condition of
affairs, and innocently taking a course which would subject her
to our power by entering one of our ports. Neither was she
bringing cargo to this country for the increase of our resources,
or the convenience of our citizens. On the contrary, she was
sailing from one port to another port of the enemy, and all
the cargo she had on board was destined for the enemy's
ports. Not only this, but she took on cargo at Havana for
Santiago, and was captured while thus actually trading from
one enemy port to another enemy port, being herself an enemy
vessel. In these ciicumstances the fact that the Pedro was
under contract to ultimately proceed, after concluding her
visits to the Spanish ports, to a port of the United States, to
there load for Europe, did not bring her within the exemption
of the proclamation.
The doctrine as to continuity of voyage as laid down by this
court in the cases cited by appellant has no application.
In The Oircasian,2 Wall. 135, it was ruled that the intent
to violate a blockade, found as a fact, was not disproved by
evidence of a purpose to call at a neutral port, not reached
at tithe of capture, with ulterior destination to the blockaded
port. In The Bermuda, 3 Wall. 514, the. actual destination
to a belligerent port, whether ulterior or direct, was held, to
determine, the character of the transaction as a whole; that
transhipment could not change the effect of the pursuit of a
common object by a common plan; and that if the cargo was
contraband its condemnation was justified, whether the voyage was to ports blockaded or to ports not blockaded; and so

366.

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Opinion of the Court.

as to the vessel in the foriner case. And in The Springbok,
5 Wall. 1, it was held that an intention to trAnship cargo
at a neutral port did not save it when destined for a blockaded
-port; that as to cargo, both in law and intent, the voyage from
London 'to the blockaded port was one voyage, and that the
liability attached from the time of sailing if captured during
any part of that voyage. The solution of the question under
consideration is not particularly aided by these and like decisions relating to blockade running and the transportation of
contraband.
In Thf Josep1, 8 Cranch, 451, the American brig Joseph
sailed from Boston with a cargo on freight April 6, 1812, on
a voyage to Liverpool, and the north of Europe, and thence
directly or indirectly to the United States. She discharged
her chrgo at Liverpool; then, under British license, she took
a cargo from Hull to St. Petersburg, and there received news
of the war between the United States and Great Britain.
She afterwards sailed from St. Petersburg to London with a
cargo consigned to merchants at that port, having delivered
which, she sailed for the United States in ballast, and was
captured not far from Boston Light, and sent into port for
adjudication. Her trading with the enemy rendered her
liable to condemnation as prize; but it was contended that
the offensive voyage terminated at London, and that she was
not taken in delicto. The court held, however, that whether
her voyage were considered an entire one from the United
States to England, thence to St. Petersburg, and thence to
the United States, or as two distinct voyages, the homeward
voyage being from St. Petersburg to the United States, with
a deviation to London, she was captured during the same
voyage in which the offence was committed, though after it
was committed, and was still in delicto.
The Argo, 1 Spinks, 315; Spinks' Prize Cases, 52, so much
relied on by counsel, was an entirely different case from that
presented by this record. The Argo was a vessel belonging
to a Russian owner, sailing under Russian colors, and bound
on a voyage from Havana to Corl. Her charter party bore
date February 7 at Havana, but it was therein stipulated that

THE PEDRO.
Opinion of the Court.

she should load at Havana or Matanzas, demurrage not to be
paid for forty-two running days. She took on sufficient
ballast at Havana to keep her safe, and left there in February
for Matanzas, where her cargo was begun to be put on board
February 28 and was completed on March 30, and she cleared
from that port April 2. March 29, 1854, the British Order
in Council printed in the margin' was issued. Dr. Lushington, adhering to the views he had expressed in The _Phwmix,
8upra,held that the order did not contemplate that the vessel
should be laden at the date of sailing and that the voyage
was commenced at Havana to end in Great Britain, notwithstanding she took cargo at Matanzas.
It was argued that the Pedro was not liable to capture and
condemnation because British subjects were the legal owners
of some and the equitable owners of the rest of the stock of
La Compafiia La Flecha, and because the vessel was insured
against risks of war by British underwriters. But the Pedro
was owned by a corporation incorporated under the laws of
Spain; had a Spanish registry; was sailing under a Spanish
1 "HerMajesty, being compelled to declare war against His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, and being desirous to lessen as much
as possible the evils thereof is pleased by and with the advice of her Privy
Council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, that Russian merchant vessels,
in any ports or places within her Majesty's dominions shall be allowed until
the tenth day of May next, six weeks from the date hereof, for loading
their cargoes and departing from such ports or places; and that such Russian merchant vessels, if met at sea by any of her Majesty's ships, shall

Spaniards. Nothing is better settled than that she must,
under such cifcumstances, be deemed to be a Spanish ship
and to be dealt with accordingly. Story on Prize Courts

These stockholders were in no position to deny that when
they elected to take the benefit of Spanish navigation laws
.And the commercial profits to be derived through discriminations thereunder against ships of other nations, they also
elected to rely on the protection furnished by the Spanish
flag. Nor can the alleged intention to restore the Pedro to
British registry, if war rendered the change desirable, be
regarded. That had not been done when the Pedro was
captured.
In conclusion, we are of opinion that the court below did
not err in refusing to allow further proofs to be taken. The
Spanish ownership was made out, and the facts that the stock
of the corporation belonged legally or equitably to British
subjects or that the loss of the vessel would be eventually

there any doubt as to the movements of the Pedro and the
trading in which she was actually engaged. The conclusion
reached by the District Court could not have been affected
by the further proofs desired to be taken.

The Pedro was a British-built ship, formerly owned and
registered in Great Britain. About nine years prior to
the 22d day of April, 1898, on which day the ship was captured, she was transferred to a Spanish corporation, took a
license from the Spanish Government, and thereafter sailed
under the Spanish flag. From the time when she thus became

a Spanish merchant. vessel she followed a course of regular
trade by sailing from some port or ports in Europe to some
port or ports in the southern part of the United States, touching in so doing at several places in the Island of Cuba. Voyages of this kind were made for about nine years prior to
the capture, the vessel usually consuming about three months
in both the outward and return voyage, being thus able to
make four trips each year between a European port and a
port in the United States. On these voyages, as illustrated
by the. one on which she was engaged when captured, the
business secured for the Cuban ports was accessory to the
main object of the voyage, which was the procuring of a
remunerative cargo in the United States. Prior to the journey to the United States, upon which she was captured, the
Pedro had last been at the port of New Orleans in January,
1898, .at which time she there paid the tonnage tax imposed
by the act of Congress, the payment then made being the
fourth for the year beginning March 2, 1897, showing that
for the year prior to her capture she had been four times in
a port of the United States and paid tonnage at such ports.
The Pedro, being in the port of Antwerp in March, 1898,
took cargo for Havana, Santiago and Cienfuegos, in the Island
of Cuba. Whilst the vessel was thus at Antwerp taking cargo
for the Cuban ports in question, she was, on the 18th of March,
1898, through brokers at Liverpool, chartered by W. S. Keyser
& Co., a firm of merchants established in Mobile and Pensacola, to proceed to Pensacola or Ship Island in the United
States "with all convenient speed,"
there to take a cargo of
lumber to be carried on the return voyage to Rotterdam.
The opening clause of the charter described the vessel as
now loading in Antwerp for Cuba, and the contract. contained the stipulations usual to such agreements. It was
provided that the charterers should not be obliged to commence loading the ship at Pensacola or Ship Island before
the 5th of May, but that the loading should be completed
in sixteen working days, and that if the vessel did not arrive
at her point of destination in the United States on or before
the 18th day of May, 1898, the charterers should have the

option of cancelling the contract. Although the vessel had
a capacity of about five thousand tons measurement, the
cargo which was taken at Antwerp for the Cuban ports
was only about two thousand tons, less than half her capacity, and the entire freight on such cargo did not exceed seven
thousand dollars, which was barely sufficient to meet the expense of receiving, transporting and delivering. On the other
hand, the freight on the lumber to be taken at either the port
of Pensacola or Ship Island, at the rates fixed in the charter
party, would have amounted to about twenty-five thousand
dollars. The ship sailed on her voyage on the 25th of March,
1898. Before doing so she took from the American consul at
the port of Antwerp a bill of health as required by the laws
of the United States. In this bill of health the vessel was
described as one "engaged in Atlantic trade, and plies between
Antwerp, Cuba and the United States;" and the consul besides certified that the "vessel has complied with the rules
and regulations made under the act of February the 15th,
1893, and that the vessel leaves this port bound for Pensacola in the United States of America via Havana, Santiago
She arrived at Havana on the 17th of
and Cienfuegos."
April, 1898, and there discharged about sixteen hundred tons
of her cargo. On the 20th of April she received from the
steamer Alava, in the port of Havana, about twenty tons of
general cargo destined for Santiago, which the latter vessel
had brought from European ports and desired to tranship,
the same never having been landed in Cuba. In the afternoon of April the 22d the steamer left Havana in continuance of her voyage. On that morning, in execution of an
order received from the President, the American fleet left
Key. West for the Island of Cuba to establish and enforce
a blockade of certain ports in the Island of Cuba which had
been proclaimed by the President. The Pedro, some distance
outside of the harbor of Havana, met the American fleet and
was captured.
There is no just foundation, however, for the contention
that in leaving the port of Havana the vessel was violating
the blockade, for at the time of her sailing the blockade had

THE PEDRO.
Dissenting Opinion: White, Brewer, Shiras, Peckham, J.

not been established. Indeed, when the capture took place
the fleet was on its way to Havana for the very purpose of initiating the blockade ordered by the proclamation of the President. Whilst it is true that subsequently to the 22d of April
Congress passed a resolution declaring that war should be considered as having been flagrant as of the date of the 21st of
April, that it was not conceived or known when the vessel
sailed from Havana on the 22d that a state of war existed
is also demonstrated by the proof, which shows that just prior
to the sailing of the Pedro fromx the harbor of Havana an
American ship was allowed to *departfrom that port, and that
shortly after the Pedro left an American steamer, which was
likewise in the port of Havana, was also permitted to leave.
Under this state of fact it seems to me that the Pedro was
within the exact requirements of the fifth article of the proclamation of the President of the United States, and hence was
not subject to capture and condemnation. The article in question is as follows:
"5. Any Spanish merchant vessel which prior to April 21,
1898, shall have sailed from any foreign port bound for any
port or place in the United States, shall be permitted to
enter such port or place, and to discharge her cargo, and afterwards forthwith to depart without molestation; and any such
vessel, if met at sea by any United States ship, shall be permitted to continue her voyage to any port not blockaded."
The theory from which it is deduced that the Pedro was not
a Spanish merchant vessel "which prior to April 21, 1898,"
had "sailed from any foreign port bound for any port or place
in the United States," is not by me understood. She assuredly sailed from Antwerp prior to the 21st of April, 1898; she
certainly was bound for a port in the United States, since she
was under a charter to American citizens, by the terms of
which she was obliged "to proceed with all convenient speed"
so as to arrive at Pensacola or Ship Island by May 5, 1898,
where she was to take on an American cargo to be carried to
the port of Rotterdam. The vessel beyond question took a
bill of health from the American consul at Antwerp, describing her as one engaged in Atlantic trade, and plying between

Europe and the United States, and the American consul certi.
fied that she was leaving the port of Antwerp bound for Pensacola in the United States via Havana, Santiago and Cienfuegos.
Under these conditions she came, in my conception, not only
within the letter of the fifth article of the proclamation, but
also within its plain intent. The object of the proclamation
was to relieve Spanish merchant vessels coming in the regular
course of a commercial voyage to our ports from, without
warning and without opportunity of returning to a port of
safety, being captured and condemned as prize of war in consequence of the breaking out of hostilities subsequent to the
inception of the voyage which the vessel was engaged in prosecuting. In this respect the proclamation was but a practical
execution of the enlightened policy by which civilized countries, on the breaking out of hostilities, have relieved merchant
vessels, coming to one or the other of the belligerent countries,
from being subject to capture when, before the happening of
war, they had undertaken a lawful voyage in the prosecution
of purely commercial duties and relations. The scope of the
proclamation is shown by a consideration of the fourth and
the fifth clauses together, the one providing for the right of an
enemy's vessel found in a port of the United States at a time
covered by the clause, to load cargo and depart without molestation, even although bound to a port of the enemy, and the
provision of the fifth article which protects from seizure and
condemnation the merchant vessels of the enemy which had
sailed bound for any port of the United States prior to the
period mentioned in the proclamation.
But, it is said, when the Pedro left Havana on the afternoon of the 22d she was not bound for Ship Island or Pensacola in the United States, but was bound for Santiago, therefore she was on a voyage between two ports of the enemy,
and was not within the fifth article of the proclamation. This,
however,-treats the voyage from Havana to Santiago as a new
and wholly independent one from that which commenced at
Antwerp. It disregards the fact that the vessel had sailed
from Antwerp for Pensacola or Ship Island via Havana and
the other ports named; it overlooks that the ship was under

express charter to American citizens, when she left Antwerp,
to proceed to Pensacola or Ship Island, and it further ignores
the certification by the consul already referred to. To treat.
the voyage from :Havana to Santiago as a new and independent one, moreover, fails to give weight to the proof showing
that the touching at the Spanish ports in the Island of Cuba
was merely incidental to the main voyage from Antwerp -to
the United States. It also does not apply the cumulative
proof arising from the long and regular course of business in
which the ship had been engaged for nine years pfior to her
capture in making regular trips from ports in Europe to ports
in the United States via designated ports in the Island of
Cuba. The decisions of this court, also, I think, refute the
contention that the ultimate termination of an outward voyage may be disregarded, in order to create a new voyage
because of the touching of a vessel at an intermediate port.
The rule, consecrated by the previous decisions of this court,
according to my understanding, is that the real intention of
a vessel as to her outward bound port is the determining factor in concluding whether in consequence of her voyage she is
or is not subject to capture as lawful prize. In The Joseyh, 8
Cranch, 451, 454, 455, the vessel being a merchant vessel of the
United States, with full knowledge of the war (1812) between
the United States and England, carried a cargo from St. Petersburg to London. After discharging the cargo at the latter
point she started in ballast for New York, her home port, and
was captured and proceeded against for the offence of trading
with the enemy. The defence was that the voyage had terminated on the arrival of the vessel in London, and that from
London to the United States she was on a new voyage, and
therefore not subject to capture and condemnation for an
offence committed on a previous voyage. The court, through
Mr. Justice Washington, said:
"It is not denied that if she be taken during the same
voyage in vhich the offence was committed, though after it
was committed, she is considered as being still in delicto, and
subject to confiscation; but it is contended that her voyage
ended at London, and that she was on her return embarked

on a new voyage. This position is directly contrary to the
facts in the case. The voyage was an entire one from the
United States to England; thence to the north of Europe;
and thence, directly or indirectly, to the United States. Even
admit that the outward and the homeward voyages could be
separated so as to render them two distinct voyages, which is
not conceded, still it cannot be denied that the termini of the
homeward voyage were St. Petersburg and the United States
.

.

.

It was, in short, a voyage from St. Petersburg' to

the United States by way of London."
In The Circassian,2 Wall. 135, a vessel sailing from one neutral port directly to another port of the same character was condemned, because it was found that the real and ultimate destination of the ship was a blockaded port in the United States.
In The Bermuda, 3 Wall. 514, a vessel with cargo from one
neutral port to another neutral port was condemned, as it was
held that the real object of the voyage was to transport- contraband of war by the vessel from. one i eutral port to the
other with the object and purpose of continuing the transportation from the neutral port, to which the vessel was consigned, into the United States through the lines of a lawfully
established blockade, the court deciding that the real purpose
and intent as to the ultimate destination of the ship and its
contraband cargo should control in determining the legality of
the capture. In speaking on the subject, through Mr. Chief
Justice Chase, the court said (p. 553):
"It makes no difference whether the destination to the
rebel port was ulterior or direct;. nor could the question of
destination be affected by transhipment at N~fassau, if transhipment was intended, for that could not break the continuity
of transpoitation of the cargo. The interposition of a neutral
poit between neutral departur6 and belligerent destination.
has always been a favorite resort of contraband carriers and
blockade runners. But it never avails them when the ultimate
destination is ascertained. A transportation from one point
to another remains continuous, so long as intent remains unchanged, no 'matter -what stoppage or transhipment intervene."1

THE PEDRO.
DIssenting Opinion: White, Brewer, Shiras, Peckham, JJ.

Applications of this doctrine are contained in the following
cases: The Hart, 3 Wall. 559; The Springbok, 5 Wall. 1
The Peterhof, 5 Wall. 28. I do not understand that in the
opinion of the court now announced the cases just cited have
been overruled. They stand, therefore, and must be reconciled
with the decision made in this case. This being so, the doctrine, from my point of view, may now be thus summed up.
Where there is a question as- to the condemnation of a vessel
as lawful prize, the fact that, between her point of departure
and her point of ultimate destination, she has touched or
unladen her cargo or a portion thereof at an intermediary port,
will not be considered as breaking the continuity of the voyage or as destroying the ulterior destination, and therefore if
that destination be unlawful the voyage will be continuous
from the point of departure to such ulterior destination, and
the vessel will consequently -be condemned. These rules are
subject to the following exiceptions: Where it becomes necessary to disregard the foregoing principles as to ulterior destination they will be given no weight, and the voyage will be
treated as having terminated at an intermediary point, and
consequently the vessel will be condemned because the voyage was not continuous. The result being, in any event, to
subject the vessel to condemnation.
It is, however, urged, conceding that the ultimate destination controls, and therefore that the stoppage at the intermediary port was of no consequence, as under the charter party
the Pedro was bound to proceed to Pensacola, there to take
on a cargo, to be delivered at Rotterdam, even under the doctrine of continuous voyage, her voyage must be treated as continuous from Antwerp via Havana, etc., to Pensacola, thence
to Rotterdam; that is to say, the continuous voyage, as manifested by the charter party, was from Antwerp to Rotterdam
via-Pensacola, hence the ship was never bound for the United
States. But this obliterates the manifest distinction between
the outward and return voyage, which is apparent in the text
of the fifth article of the proclamation.
Even conceding that from some points of view the round
voyage, that is, both the outward and return trip, should be

OCTOBER TERM, 1899.
Dissenting Opinion: White, Brewer, Shiras, Peckham, JJ.

considered as being continuous, such concession cannot in reason be the test for determining whether under the proclamation the vessel was bound for the United States. If it be held
that both the inward and the outward voyage are to be taken
under the proclamation as the criterion for determining whether
a vessel was bound for the United States, it would follow that
the proclamation had no relation whatever to any foreign ship,
other than such a. ship bound to a port of the United States
without the intention of departing, that is, with the intention
of remaining in the port of the United States. The proclamation, however, provides that the vessels bound for the United
States to which it refers "shall be permitted to enter such port
or place, and to discharge her cargo, and afterward forthwith
to depart without molestation; and any such vessel, if met at
sea by any United States ship, shall be permitted to continue
her voyage to any port not blockaded." This plainly distinguishes between the voyage on which the vessel is bound for
the port of the United States and the voyage to be undertaken
by the vessel from the port of the United States to which she
is bound back to her homeward or some other neutral port.
To construe the proclamation so as to cause it to embrace
only vessels bound for the United States without any purpose
of thereafter departing, would exclude from its operation the
entire class of vessels it was its purpose to protect from condemnation. The error of such a consideration becomes to
my mind plain, especially when it is borne in mind that it is
conceded on all sides that the proclamation should receive a
liberal construction in favor of the public purpose which it
embodies, and against the liability of innocent and unwarned
private property to capture and condemnation.
It was strenuously argued at bar, and, as I understand the
opinion of the court, it is now held, that the Pedro was not
embraced within the fifth article of the proclamation because
she did not have cargo for the United States. The object of
the fifth clause of the proclamation, it was said, was to allow
vessels with cargo bound for the United States to be free
from capture, because it was the public policy of the United
States, on the outbreak of war, to encourage the bringing in

THE PEDRO.
Dissenting Opinion: White, Brewer, Shiras, Peckham, JJ.

of cargo. The text of the proclamation does not, however,
support this contention. It declares that all vessels which
"have sailed from any foreign port bound for any port or
place in the United States shall be permitted to enter such
pqrt or place

.

.

2" It does not say all vessels which

have sailed with cargo, but that all vessels shall be so permitted. True it is that the proclamation also authorizes the
vessel thus permitted to enter to discharge her cargo. But
the mere adding to the permission to enter, the right to discharge cargo, cannot be taken as denying permission to enter,
if there be no cargo to discharge. It cannot in any event be
said that the proclamation in plain terms confers the privilege
of safe entry only on vessels 'having cargo; and if it does not,
then construction is required, and the rule is that a liberal
construction must be applied in order to protect the innocent
private vessel from capture and condemnation. This supposed
theory of the desire to encourage the bringing in of cargo,
upon which it is assumed that the fifth article of the proclamation rests, entirely discards or at least ignores the enlightened moral sense which the proclamation embodies, that is,
the duty not to capture without warning merchant vessels
bound to our shores previous to the outbreak of war, and substitutes for it what to me seems the sordid motive of a supposed gain to result from incoming cargo. In other words,
in its last analysis, the contention that the proclamation contemplates only exempting a vessel from seizure which has
cargo for the United States, really asserts that fair dealing
and justice are embodied in the proclamation only so far as
it was deemed that profit might be derived from being just,
0nd no further. Such an interpretation of the proclamation,
however, is refuted by its very terms, since its preamble
declares that its object was to mitigate the wrongs of war in
accordance with the practice pursued by enlightened and
civilized nations. Aside from these considerations, the supposed advantage tAbe derived from allowing cargo to come
in, when considerd 'intrinsically, is without force. Under
this theory, two vessels would depart on the same day from
a foreign port; one bound to a port in the United States, with

cargo, under a charter to foreign citizens to convey their
goods into this country; the second ship proceeding in ballast
under charter to American citizens to proceed to the United
States and there take cargo. The argument is that the vessel
chartered to the foreigner and containing his goods in the
execution of his contract would be exempt from capture,
whilst the vessel sailing in order to carry out the contract
made with and in favor of an American citizen would be subject to capture. But this contention as to cargo is not only
in conflict with the text of the fifth article, but is also at war
is, the
with another provision of the proclamation -that
fourth article. By that article a Spanish vessel found in a
port of the United States, as therein stated, is not only allowed
to depart, but is also accorded the privilege of taking on cargo
and carrying it either to a neutral port or to a port of the
enemy, if not blockaded, up to a stated date without molestation. But the language conferring the privilege of loading
cargo contained in the fourth article, whilst really only permissive, must be construed as imperative, if the permissive
privilege to discharge cargo in the fifth article be held an
imperative one, for no distinction can be drawn between the
two. The argument then comes to this, that the public policy
of the proclamation deemed the coming in of cargo so important that it provided for the capture of all vessels sailing for
ports of the United States prior to the commencement of war,
if they did not have cargo, and that the same public policy
considered the taking away of cargo from the United States
so important that the privilege given in the fourth article to
Spanish merchant vessels in our ports to depart could be
availed of, provided only they took cargo away from the
United States. An interpretation which gives rise to so unreasonable a contradiction seems to me to demonstrate its
own unsoundness.
But all the considerations which are relied on as justifying
the condemnation in this case seem to me to be fully answered
by authority. Both the fourth and fifth articles of the proclamation of the President were almost word for word a repro:

Great Britain. The departure of the vessel from Havana in
ballast was prior to the date fixed by the Order in Council.
After arriving at Matanzas she there took on cargo, and sailed
from that port for Great Britain, subsequent to the date fixed
in the Order in Council. She was captured, and the -question
of her condemnation was considered and decided by Dr. Lushington. It was held that the vessel was protected by the
Order in Council, and she was released. Necessarily, under
the facts stated, the ultimate end of the outward voyage to
Great Britain, and not the intermediary port at which the
Argo stopped, controlled; otherwise she would have been subject to condemnation. This follows, as the order in terms
only protected Russian merchant vessels which had sailed
prior to the date of the order. As the sailing for Great
Britain from Matanzas was subsequent to the order, it necessarily results that the date of sailing relied upon as protecting
was the date of the sailing from Havana, and not the subsequent departure from the intermediate port. So, also, the
case necessarily decided that the presence of cargo was not
essential to entitle the vessel to protection under the Order in
Oouncil, since the vessel sailed in ballast from Havana, and
only departed from Matanzas, where the cargo was taken on,
after the date of the order, and therefore ata time and under
conditions which would not have protected her unless the
antecedent conditions existing at the time of the sailing had
been considered as determinative.
The language of Dr. Lushington, in passing upon the case,
is to my mind so persuasive of the issues which arise upon this
record, that I quote from it. He said (Spinks' Prize Cases,

p. 53):
"This vessel did sail from the Havannah prior to the date
of the Order; she sailed from Matanzas subsequently to the
date of the Order. When she left the Havannah she was in
ballast bound for Cork, according to the charter party.
"It has been contended that this Order in Council contemplated that the Russian vessel should have been laden at the
date of the Order; but I find no words in the Order that
would justify my putting so strict a construction upon it;

THE PEDRO.
Dissenting Opinion: White, Brewer, Shiras, Peckham, JJ.

neither do I think that there are any words which impose the
necessity of not touching at or taking a cargo at some other
port than that where the voyage commenced. For instance,
I apprehend that a vessel might have taken in a part of her
cargo from one foreign port, having left that port prior to the
29th of March, and taken in another part of the cargo at
another foreign port subsequently.
"The real meaning of the Order in Council, according to
my view of it, is, that the vessel shall have sailed prior to the
29th of March, on a voyage to end in Great Britain, and I
am clearly of opinion that this was one continuous voyage,
the commencement of which was at the Havannah, and that
the sailing from Havannah prior to March the 29th is a substantial compliance with the terms of the Order."
Some stress was laid in argument, and seems to be given
weight in the opinion of the court, to the language of Dr.
Lushington referring to the taking on of the cargo. But,
clearly, from the text of his opinion, this language was used
in relation to the argument presented to him, which was that
although a vessel sailing in ballast, without cargo, prior to the
date of the Order in Council, was admittedly within its purview, the Argo was not covered by it, because subsequent to
the proclamation she took on her cargo at an intermediate
port. In meeting this argument the question of cargo was
referred to, and the whole purport of the Order was summed
up in language which I again quote. It was as follows:
"The real meaning of the Order of Council, according to
my view of it, is, that the vessel shall have sailed prior to the
29th of March, on a voyage to end in Great Britain, and I- am
clearly of opinion that this was one continuous voyage, the
commencement of which was at the Havannah, and that the
sailing from Havannah prior to March the 29th is a substantial compliance with the terms of the Order."
The sailing from Havana, thus decided to have been sufficient, I again remark, was in ballast and without cargo.
This construction of the Order in Council, I have said,
should be persuasive, indeed, if it should not be held to have
been adopted and ratified by the reproduction in the procla-

mation of the President of the very language of the Order in
Council, so many years after that order had been thus construed by the British Admiralty tribunal.
Thinking that the condemnation of this ship under the
circumstances disclosed by the record will subject innocent
private property to condemnation without just cause, will deprive it of the protection afforded by the proclamation of the
President, which, according to its terms, but carried out those
commendable principles of honesty and humanity, enforced
by all, civilized nations on the outbreak of war, I am constrained to dissent.
