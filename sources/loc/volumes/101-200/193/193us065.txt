THE EASTERN

DISTRICT OF

NEW YORK.

Nos. 307, 308. 309, 312. Argued January 12,1904.-Decided February 23, 19"4.

The act of April 29, 1902, c. 641, continuing all laws then in force "so far
as the same are not inconsistent with treaty obligations," does not repeal
§ 3 of the act of May 5, 1892, putting the burden of proving their right
to remain in this country, on Chinese arrested under the act. Neither
does it repeal § 6 of the act requiring Chinese laborers who are entitled
to remain in the United States to obtain a certificate of residence.
A written statement by a United States Commissioner that a Chinese person
of a certain name was brought before him and was adjudged to have the
right to remain in the United States by reason of being a citizen is not
evidence of a judgment.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Argument for Appellants.

193 U. S.

Direct appeals have been taken to this court upon the ground
that treaty and constitutional questions were involved. Chin
Bak Kan v. United States, 186 U. S. 193; United States v. Gue
Lim, 176 U. S. 459; United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S.
649. The treaty and constitutional questions were raised upon
the preliminary hearing before the Commissioner.
These are the first cases which have come before this court
in which a construction of the act of April 29, 1902, renacting,
extending and continuing all laws relating to the subject of
Chinese exclusion, "so far as the same are not inconsistent with
treaty obligations" is asked, and are the first cases which have
come before this court since the Fong Yue Ting Case, 149 U. S.
698, in which a consideration of the registration provisions of
the act of 1892, as amended by the act of 1893, is involved.
These are in no sense "entry cases." The defendants were
not arrested while seeking entrance to the United States, nor
shortly after effecting entrance. The complaints assumed that
the defendants were residents during the registration period
fixed by the acts of 1892 and 1893, and there was no testimony
to controvert the fact of long years of residence in the United
States. They are the first cases in this court since the ,ong
Yue Ting case, in which the defendants were at the time of
arrest actually residing in the United States.
Section 3 of the act of 1892, placing the burden of proof on
Chinese defendants and section 6 of the same act as amended
by the act of 1893, in so far as it relates to the deportation of
Chinese residents of the United States, have all been revoked
or superseded by section 1 of the act of April 29, 1902, which
(in providing for the re~nactment of the Chinese exclusion laws
only in so far as the same were not inconsistent with treaty
obligations) assures to Chinese persons, either permanently or
temporarily residing in the United States for the protection of
their persons and property, all rights given by the laws of the
United States to citizens of the most favored nation (article 4
of the treaty of 1894), the sections above mentioned being
inconsistent with said treaty provision.

AH HOW v. UNITED STATES.
193 U. S.

Argument for Appellants.

Earlier legislation on the subject of Chinese exclusion was
concededly in violation of treaty obligations with China. Chae
Chang Ping v. United States, 130 U. S. 581; Lem Moon Sing v.
United States, 158 U. S. 538; Fong Yue Ting v. United States,
149 U. S. 697; United States v. Gue Linz, 176 U. S. 459, 464.
Even after judicial expression on this subject, Congress, with
"malice aforethought," reinacted this legislation. Acts of
May 5, 1892, and November 3, 1893. And see Sen. Doc. Rep.
776, part 2, pp. 44-97, 1902, referring to statutory violations
of the treaty presented by John W. Foster for Chinese Minister.
A construction which seeks to effectuate treaty obligations
should be sought rather than the contrary. Chew Heong v.
United States, 112 U. S. 536; United States v. Gue Lim, 176 U. S.
459, 465; Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 194.
Section 3 of the act of 1892 is repealed to the extent, of its
repugnance, to wit, in so far as requiring Chinese residents of
the United States to establish by affirmative proof, their right
to remain here. See Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342,
363; United States v. Tynan, 11 Wall. 88; South Carolinav.
Stoll, 17 Wall. 425.
There is a distinction between an alien who remains here and
one who has left here and seeks to return. While here he is
entitled to the benefit and guarantees of life, liberty and property secured by the Constitution to all persons of whatever race
within the jurisdiction of the United States. His personal
rights when he is in this country and such of his property as is
here during his absence are as fully protected by the supreme
law of the land as if he were a naturalized citizen of the United
States. But when he has voluntarily gone from the country
and is beyond its jurisdiction, being an alien, he cannot reenter
the United States in violation of the will of the Government, as
expressed in enactments of the law-making power. Lem Moon
Sing v. United States, 158 U. S. 547, 548; United States v. Wong
Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 700.
The construction contended for is reasonable and just. It
is not only within the spirit of the act of 1902 and the treaty

193 U. S.

It is a much narrower

construction of the act and treaty, than the construction of
section 6 of the act of 1884 adopted in Lau Ou Bew, 144 U. S.
47. It is not as narrow as that in United States v. Gzie Linz, 176
U. S. 467. As to due process of law and definitions applicable
to this case, see Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97, 107;
Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 635. This clause cannot,
be given any wider scope. See Wong Wing v. United States,
163 U. S. 227.

affected by the decision in the case of Chin Bak Kati, 186 U. S.
193.
Neither the act of 1892, nor the act of 1893 amending it,
required that Chinese persons who were merchants or who
"were engaged in business rather than manual labor" should
procure certificates of residence during the period when the
registration provisions were in force. Lee Kan v. United
States, 62 Fed. Rep. 914; Pinn Kwran Case, 100 Fed. Rep. 609,
reviewing 94 Fed. Rep. 824.
The question is not whether the respondent is a merchant
and so exempt from registration, but whether he is a laborer
and so liable to deportation for want of registration. He does
not appear to be a laborer within either common understanding
or the statutory definition of the term. United States v. Mark
Ying (a peddler), 76 Fed. Rep. 450.
If these defendants were engaged in business in 18,94, rather
than in manual labor, but since, through misfortune or other
cause have become laborers, they are, nevertheless, not. subject
to these registration provisions. Treasury Dec. No. 14,5421,
November 25, 1893.
As to those who were minors when the registration act was
in force as to laborers, they should not be required to produce
certificates. United States v. Gue Lirn, 176 U. S. 462; In rc
Tung, 19 Fed. Rep. 184.

The construction contended for by the Government would
be imputing to Congress intention to work gross hardship in
the matter of requiring imprisonment pending appeals inconsistent with its subordination of these statutes by the act of

persons for the protection of their persons and property all the
rights of the most favored nation, and besides would be of more

than doubtful constitutionality as involving imprisonment as
distinguished from mere brief detention, incidental to deportation. Yicl Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 368; In re Qwong

Rep. 206; In re Lintner, 57 Fed. Rep. 587.
The statutes throwing the burden of proof on the Chinamen
arrested are inconsistent with Art. 4 of the treaty of 1894,
and with the amendments to the Federal Constitution. A
later inconsistent statute supersedes a prior treaty. Exclusion

495; cases cited under last point and Mrs. Gue Lir v. United
States, 176 U. S. 459, 465.
The registration provisions have been erroneously construed
below as having required all persons not now proved to be
merchants as defined in the act, to register as "laborers," as
also persons who were minors, residing in the United States in
1892 having no occupation of their own, contrary to a reasonable construction and understanding of these laws, at least
as given during the six months following November 3, 1893,
during which alone registration was permitted.
As to provisions of registration of merchants and witnesses
in regard thereto, see Li Sing v. United States, ISO U. S. 486;

to exclude the certificate of United States Commissioner, the
genuineness whereof was admitted and which was relied upon
to show an adjudication made after due hearing in 1897, by a
United States Commissioner to the effect that the defendant
was a citizen of the United States by birth.
The Commissioner had jurisdiction to determine citizenship.
Chin Bak Kan v. United States, 185 U. S. 193. The certificate
was sufficient to establish res judicata. Treaty Dec. 22,572;
United States v. Chung Shee, 76 Fed. Rep. 951, 956; United
States v. Luey Guey Auck, 115 Fed. Rep. 252. Compare United
States v. Hills, 124 Fed. Rep. 831; Kirby v. United States, 174
U. S. 47; Spar! v. United States, 156 U. S. 51, 56.
The principle of res judicata applies to determinations based
upon jurisdiction, whether made in courts of record or not of
record. Gates v. Preston, 41 N. Y. 13; Reich v. Cochrane, 151
N. Y. 122; Mohr v. Maniere, 17 Fed. Cas. No. 9695, affirmed
101 U. S. 416.
Congress has to provide methods by which the Commissioner's determination upon such issues can be proved. United
States v. Jones, 134 U. S. 483; Hoyne v. United States, 38 Fed.
Rep. 542; Philips v. United States, 33 Fed. Rep. 164; §847,

obtainable. Treasury Dec. 8572, 11,606, at p. 1048; 14,375,
14,654, 17,237. As to the excuse of illness, the Commissioner
has attempted to give this statute an unduly harsh and severe
construction, to the effect that there must not have been a day
during the statutory period during which illness, did not prevent registration. This is an unwarranted and oppressive construction of the statute, not sustained by the authorities.

ment in the matter of prescribing regulations and forms of
certificates required by the act of 1893.
The complaints stated no cause of action. Accordingly, the
general line of authority requiring complaints setting forth the
facts establishing causes of action, is applicable here. Rice v.
Ames, 180 U. S. 371; Ex pare Hart, 63 Fed. Rep. 249, 259; Ex

The complaints should have been under oath. Register v.
Lee Lure, 94 Fed. Rep. 343, 346; Souzthworth v. United States,
161 U. S. 639, 642.
These proceedings were all barred by the statute of linitations of five years, since more than five years have elapsed
since registration was authorized and the defendants were
shown to have been continuously resident within the United
States for upwards of twenty years except Lew Guey, the
holder of the McGettrick certificate.
If these proceedings are not criminal, they are at least qua.si
criminal within the meaning of § 1047, Rev. Stat.; Boyd v.
United States, 116 U. S. 616; Lees v. United States, 150 U. 8.

they partake so far of the nature of criminal proceedings as to
be governed by these provisions, applicable to proceedings for
penalties and forfeitures. Ex parte Sing, 82 Fed. Rep. 22;

either the claim of merchant status or that of citizenship,
and amply justified the commissioner's orders of deportation,
and his finding as to the merchant claim that the proofs
furnished did not clearly establish facts which would bring
these persons within the statute as merchants.
The term" merchant," as it is used in Chinese exclusionlegislation, has been clearly defined by the law and by the decisions
of the courts. Section 2, act of Nov. 3, 1893; In re Ah Yow,
59 Fed. Rep. 561; Lai Moy v. United States, 77 Fed. Rep. 955;
Mar Bing Guey v. United States, 97 Fed. Rep. 576, and has
expressly been held not to include bookkeepers and paid assistants in a store. United States v. Pin Kwan, 100 Fed. Rep. 609;
Quock Ting v. United States, 140 U. S. 417; In re Louie You, 97
Fed. Rep. 580; United States v. Lee Huen, 118 Fed. Rep. 458.
The points raised in these cases have been heretofore considered by the court and positively and conclusively determined. The court has held that the treaty of 1894 did not
repeal existing law; that defects in complaint or pleading do
not affect the authority of the commissioner or judge of the
validity of the statute; that the adjudication of the judge or
commissioner is final; that the court cannot properly re-,
examine facts already determined by two judgments below;
that the policy of Chinese legislation is opposed to numerous
appeals. Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 729;
United States v. Lee Yen Tai, 185 U. S. 213; Chin Bak Kan v.
United States, 186 U. S. 193.
The contentions that the act of April 29, 1902, repeals by
implication the laws of 1892 and 1893, and that the offense is
barred by the operation of §§ 1046, 1047, Rev. Stat., are
without merit. The language of the act of 1902 makes it
evident that Congress considered the entire scheme of exclusion law, embracing the treaty, as forming one complete, harmonious and consistent whole. The act of 1902 is merely
additional legislation on the subject, and there is nothing
repugnant between that and former acts. Neither § 1046,
which provides a limitation of five years for prosecutions under

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Argument for the United States.

193 U. S.

the revenue and slave trade laws, nor § 1047, imposing the
same limitation on suits or prosecutions for penalties or forfeitures, touches Chinese exclusion in the remotest way. But
if the case were otherwise, it is sufficient to say that the offense
is a continuing one; it is the gist of the subject that the Chinaman never had and has not now any right to be here.
Congress intended the determination of the rights of a
Chinaman to be prompt and final in the lower tribunals. The
statutory provisions as to bail in Chinese cases limit the discretion of courts and judges and forbid the taling of bail.
Sec. 5, act of May 5, 1892; sec. 2, act of Nov. 3, 1893. The
practice on the subject is conflicting, but it appears to tend
to the refusal of bail. In re Ah Kee, 21 Fed. Rep. 701; In re
Chow Goo Pooi, 25 Fed. Rep. 76; In re Ah Aloy, 25 Fed. Rep.
808; In re Chin Yuen Sing, 65 Fed. Rep. 788; Chan Gun v.
United States, 9 D. C. App. 290. So far as affirmative law
goes, and disregarding, for the sake of argument, the clear
prohibition in the statutes cited, the fact is that the Chinese
case falls between the two categories of civil and criminal as
used in the Revised Statutes respecting bail, §§ 945, 1014,
1015, and is unprovided for on that point.
No general or fundamental right of appeal exists here.
Where Congress has given one appeal specifically, no further
appeal is to be inferred or implied. Railroad Company v.
Grant, 98 U. S. 398; McKane v. Durston, 153 U. S. 684; Kohl
v. Lehlbacl, 160 U. S. 293.
The law defines a laborer and a merchant, and those claiming
to be merchants must bring themselves clearly within the
definition and conditions. A Chinese person, technically a.
minor, whose claim of citizenship is not established, who has
been here for an uncertain time, and is found to be a laborer,
cannot escape the result of that status merely because of his
minority. In such cases the exceptions to the certificate requirements in the case of minor children of a domiciled merchant, are not applicable. United States v. kirs. Gzie Lira,
176 U. S.459.

The claim of citizenship by birth is not to be conceded upon
a mere assertion of the fact unaccompanied by corroborative

JUsTICE

HoLLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.

These are appeals from judgments of the United States
District Court confirming decisions of a commissioner, and
adjudging that the appellants be removed from the United
States to China. Chin Bak .Zanv. United States, 186 U. S. 193.
The commissioner decided that each of the appellants was a Chinese laborer found without certificate of residence as required by
law within the United States, and was not entitled to remain
within the United States. The facts may be summed up as
follows: The appellants were arrested in July, 1902, when
working in laundries, they all having failed to produce certificates of residence when called upon to do so by the Chinese
inspector. At the hearing before the commissioner they
offered testimony of witnesses other than Chinese that they
were residents of the United States on May 5, 1892. Ah How
and Chu Do put in evidence that they were not laborers.
Yung Lee offered evidence of illness, which he contended made
him unable to procure his certificate. Chu Do offered parol
evidence that he was born in the United States, and therefore
was a citizen, and also that he was a minor during the time
allowed by the statute for obtaining a certificate. Lew Guey
offered similar evidence and a certificate of another United
States commissioner of a hearing before him and an adjudication that Lew Guey had the right to remain in the United
States by reason of being a citizen thereof. The United
States offered no evidence beyond the facts stated above.
The ground of appeal common to all the cases is that §§ 3

Opinion of the Court.

193 U. S.

and 6 of the act of May 5, 1892, 27 Stat. 25, have been repealed. By § 3 any Chinese person arrested under the provisions of the act shall be adjudged to be unlawfully within the
United States, unless he shall establish by affirmative proof to
the satisfaction of the judge or commissioner his right to remain. Of course, if the burden of proof was on the appellants,
the commissioner and judge might not be satisfied by the
affirmative evidence produced. We are not asked to review
the finding of fact. See Fong
ue Tiny v. United States,
149 U. S. 698, 714, 715. But it is argued that this section
is done away with by § 1 of the act of April 29, 1902, c.
641, 32 Stat. 176, continuing all laws then in force, "so far as
the same are not inconsistent with treaty obligations." It is
said that the section is inconsistent with Article 4 of the treaty
of December 8, 1894, 28 Stat. 1210, agreeing that Chinese
laborers, or Chinese of any other class, either permanently or
temporarily residing in the United States, shall have for the
protection of their persons and property all rights that are
given by the laws of the United States to citizens of the most.
favored nation, excepting the right to become naturalized
citizens. It is pointed out that the treaty of 1894 with Japan
and the treaty of 1859 with Paraguay give the rights and
privileges of native citizens to the subjects of those countries
in access to the courts and in the defence of their rights, and
it is said that the law as to the burden of proof cuts down
those privileges and rights. The section has been upheld, however, by this court, since the treaty, and after the passage of
the act. Chin Bak Kanb v. United States, 186 U. S. 193, 200;
United States v. lee Yen Tai, 185 U. S. 213. It is not repealed by the laws of 1902. The clause of the treaty had a
different object, and in view of the difficulties encountered in
such an investigation, it could not have been supposed to
promise that special measures theretofore taken should not. be
continued in force for the purpose of ascertaining the very
question whether the laborers were lawfully residing in the
United States or not. See Fong wue Ting v. United States,
149 U. S. 698, 730. But it is enough to say that the treaty
itself, in Article 5, expressly refers to the act of 1892 as

amended by the act of 1893, and states that the Chinese
government will not object to the enforcement of those acts.
It follows still more clearly from the language of Article 5
of the treaty that § 6, as amended by the act of November,
3, 1893, 28 Stat. 7, remains in force. Zee lung v. Patterson,
186 U. S. 168, 176, 177. That section requires Chinese laborers
who are entitled to remain in the United States to obtain a
certificate of residence from the collector of internal revenue
of their district, or to be deported, subject to certain excuses.
Article 5 of the treaty especially refers to the requirements of
registration in -the acts of 1892 and 1893, although, as we
have said, it states that the enforcement of the acts as a whole
will not be objected to. In one or two of the cases there was
a suggestion below that § 6 of the act was unconstitutional,
but that question was disposed of in -Font
Y-ue Ting v. United
States, 149 U. S. 698, and was not pressed.
The complaints are objected to as insufficient, because in
addition to alleging that the appellants are laborers not entitled to remain in the United States without certificates, it
adds the words "having come unlawfully into the United
States without certificates," thus implying, it is said, that an
unlawful coming into the United States could be legalized by
obtaining a certificate. It is enough to say that such objections have been answered by Fong Yue Ting v. United States,
149 U. S. 698, 729, and C]iin Bak Kan v. United States, 186
U. S. 193, 199. In the former it was laid down that" no formal
complaint or pleadings are required." That proposition is not
affected by the later statutes. We d6 not mean to imply that
there is anything in the objection if we should consider it on
its merits.
As to the testimony that two of the appellants were merchants during the period of registration, all that appears is
that the commissioner did not believe it. We cannot go outside the record of the specific case for the purpose of inquiring whether the decision was induced by some view of the
law which may be open to argument. The same may be said
as to the parol testimony as to the age of two of the appellants and their birth in this country. But we may add that it

by no means follows from the decision in United States v. .Mrs.
Gue Lim , 176 U. S. 459, that the minor children of laborers,
old enough to do work, are not required to have certificates.
The language of the statute certainly is broad enough to include them and does not indicate a division by local laws with
regard to coming of age. The principle applicable to the admission into this country of the wife and children of a certilicated merchant is not the principle applicable to such a case.
As to the certificate of the United States commissioner, offered
by Lev Guey, it was merely a written statement by the commissioner that a person of that name was brought before him
on the usual charge, and was adjudged to have the right to
remain in the United States by reason of being a citizen.
Apart from the possibility that the commissioner in the present hearing was not satisfied of the identity of the party,
such a statement is not the certificate of evidence required by
the act of 1892, and is not evidence of a judgment. United
States v. Iew Poy D6,w, 119 Fed. Rep. 786. The evidence
that Yung Lee was disabled by sickness from obtaining a
certificate did not satisfy the commissioner. We cannot say
as matter of law that he was bound to be satisfied by the
testimony of Yung Lee himself that he was so disabled.
We have assumed, for the purpose of decision, what does
not clearly appear from the record, that the judge who tried
the case on appeal tried it solely on the commissioner's report of evidence and heard no witnesses. Whether the fact
could be assumed if the result would be a reversal of the
judgment below, we nebd not decide. See United States v.
Lee Seick, 100 Fed. Rep. 398, 399. There is no other question
worthy of notice. We are asked to express an opinion as to
the right of the appellants to give bail pending their appeal,
but that now is a moot point. We agree with the Government, that these cases are covered by previous decisions of
this court.
