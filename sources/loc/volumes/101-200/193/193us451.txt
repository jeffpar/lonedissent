GAGNON v. UNITED STATES.
193 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

Connecticut, 371; Illinois Central Railroad Company v. Read,
37 Illinois, 484, 510. As was well observed by Circuit Judge
Putnam in Duncan v. Maine Central Railroad Company, 113
Fed. Rep. 508, 514, in words quoted with approval by the
Court of Appeals in this case:
"The result we have reached conforms the law applicable
to the present issue to that moral sense which justly holds
those who accept gratuities and acts of hospitality to perform
the conditions on which they are granted."
We see no error in the record, and the judgment of the Court
of Appeals is
Affirmed.
GAGNON v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 163.

Argued February 29, 1904.-Decided rarch 21, 1904.

The inherent power which exists in a court to amend its records, and correct
mistakes and supply defects and omissions therein, is not a power to
create a new record but presupposes an existing record susceptible of
correction or amendment.
An order, entered nuno pro tunc thirty-three years after an unrecorded
judgment naturalizing an alien is alleged to have been rendered, may
be attacked collaterally on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction
to enter such an order, when no entry or memorandum appears in the
record or files at the time alleged for the-original entry of the judgment.
In the absence of jurisdiction to make such an order, the fact that notice of
the application therefor was given to the Attorney General does not give
the court jurisdiction.

THIs was a petition filed in the Court of Claims in 1894 and
amended in 1902, to recover the value of one-half of certain
property taken in 1866 from the firm of which the petitioner
was a member by Indians then in amity with the United States.
The facts found in the case were substantially as follows:
Charles Gagnon was a British subject. In March, 1858, he
declared before the District Court of Woodbury County, Iowa,
his intention to become a citizen of the United States. He

OCTOBER TERML 1903

alleged that in 1863 he was admitted by the District Court of
Richardson County, in the Territory of Nebraska, as a,citizen
of the United States, but no entry of this fact appeared in the
records of that court for the year 1863.
It appeared Hosford & Gagnon, under which firm name they
traded, owned horses and cattle of the aggregate value of
$15,500 and in 1866, without just cause or provocation on
their part, Indians belonging to the defendant tribes, then in
amity with the United States, took them away. Hosford filed
his claim. for one-half of the amount and obtained judgment,
which has been satisfied. Gagnon's claim was for the remaining half.
It further appeared that in the prosecution of his claim
Gagnon failed to produce his certificate of naturalization, or a
duly authenticated copy thereof. To meet the requirements
of the law, providing that only citizens of the United States

can recover under the Indian Depredation Act, Gagnon relied
exclusively on a record of the District Court for the first, judicial district of the State of Nebraska, (successor of the District
Court of the Territory,) purporting to enter nune pro lime a
judgment of naturalization of the territorial court as of the
date of September 25, 1863.
No paper, memorandum or entry of any kind was found in
the records of the court tending to show that a certificate of
naturalization had been issued to Gagnon in that year. It
also appeared that the persons who held the offices of judge
and clerk of the territorial court in 1863 were both (lead.
The record of the state court recited that it had been made
to appear "by competent evidence" that the alleged application for naturalization had been granted by the territorial
court, but that the "judgment of naturalization was never
recorded, and if recorded the record is lost and cannot be
found in the records of this court, and it being legal and proper
that said record should be supplied, and this court being willing
that said error and omission be corrected, it is ordered and
adjudged that said judgment so rendered by this court at its

September term, 1863, be entered at large on the journal of
this court as of the date when it should have been entered,
to wit, on the 25th day of September, 1863, and that the clerk
issue to the said Charles Gagnon the proper certificate of
naturalization," et;.
It further appeared that on March 19, 1897, Gagnon's attorneys wrote the Attorney General that application would be
made to the District Court of Richardson County, Nebraska,
on March 29, 1897, "for restoration of certain lost records
relative to the naturalization of said Gagnon."
Upon the facts thus found the Court of Claims decided that
Gagnon was not a citizen of the United States at the time the
depredation was committed, and the petition was dismissed.

Immediately upon the admission of Nebraska as a State the
legislature passed the act of June 15, 1867, Laws, 1867, p. 58,
making the District Courts of the State successors to the District Courts of the Territory, and see ยง 905, Rev. Stat.
While in some of the older jurisdictions the practice has
grown up of requiring written applications for naturalization,
there was no statute requiring it when this claimant was
naturalized in 1863.
It has been held since the earliest times that naturalization
proceedings are conclusive where they were had in a court of
competent jurisdiction. Spratt v. Spratt, 4 Pet. 393, 407;

No. 2980.
The Court of Claims undertook to pass upon the validity of
the proceedings in the District Court, in a collateral procee(ding, and upon evidence aliunde, but the validity of a judicial
record cannot be questioned by a court not sitting in review,
except upon the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction.

709; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 718; Ex parte
Watkins, 7 Pet. 568, 572.
If the record was improperly supplied it was not a matter of
usurpation of jurisdiction but error. The Court of Claims has
no jurisdiction to correct error of a state court, and least of all
to correct it upon evidence aliunde.
The record of the naturalization of the claimant in the district court of the Territory as certified by the clerk of the district court of the first judicial district of the State, successor
to the territorial court, imports verity. That court is sole
custodian of its own records. The record, no matter when
made, or no matter after what distance of years it was supplied,
imports absolute verity and is binding upon all other courts
within the United States.
The absolutely binding character of a judicial record and
the extent to which it imports absolute verity are principles
elementary in the law. Art. IV, ยง 1, Const. U. S.
Whether it be a question of the power of the court to supply
a record of proceedings unrecorded by the clerk, or to supply
a lost record, the authorities are equally clear. The leading
case in this court is In re Wight, 134 U. S. 136. See also Gon-

In In re Wight, 134 U. S. 136, this court in a criminal case
sanctioned an order supplying the record at a subsequent
term. If such an amendment can be made at one term later
no limit can be drawn upon the exercise of the power. In
United States v. Vigil, 10 Wall. 423, a record supplied after
two years was held good. In Balch v. Shaw, 7 Cush. 282, 284,
the correction was made fourteen years after the time the
proceedings took place.
In Rugg v. Parker, 7 Gray, 172, a record was made nunc
pro tunc after 20 years; in Lawrence v. Richmond, 1 J. & W. 241,
after 23 years; in Taylor v. McElrath, 35 Alabama, 330, after
20 years; in Parsonsv. McBride,49 N.Car. (4 Jones's Law) 99,
after 36 years.
The cases cited show that each court must necessarily be the
judge of what it has decided and adjudged and when it orders
an amendment of the record the presumption of other courts
must necessarily be, that it does not undertake to order its
clerk to record what it never had decided. Sprague v. Litherberry, 4 McL. 442, 449; 22 Fed. Cases, No. 13,251; Inhabitants
of Limerick, 18 Maine, 187.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

193 U. S

It is suggested in the opinion below that there has usually
been shown to be a cause pending on which to found an order
restoring the record. But none of the cases makes any distinction of this sort, or limits the power to those in which there
is a pending cause. In United States v. Hill, 120 U. S. 169, it
was held that a proceeding for naturalization is not a "cause"
in the strict sense of the term but a special and peculiar case
of which the courts have jurisdiction, where only the party
asking for the right or privilege is before the court. And see
Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 207.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Thompson, with whom 3Mr.
Assistant Attorney Peyton was on the brief, for the United
States.
MR. JUSTICE

BROWN delivered the opinion of the court.

This case raises the simple question whether thirty-three
years after a judgment naturalizing an alien is alleged to have
been rendered but not recorded, or if recorded, the record lost.,
a common law court has jurisdiction to enter such judgment

of naturalization nunc pro tunc, when no entry or memorandum
appeared upon the record or files at. the time the original judgment is supposed to have been rendered. If there be no jurisdiction to enter such judgment, it may be attacked collaterally.
The power to amend its records, to correct mistakes of the
clerk or other officer of the court, inadvertencies of counsel,
or to supply defects or omissions in the record, even after the
lapse of the term, is inherent in courts of justice, and was
recognized by this court in In re Wight, 134 U. S. 136; Gonzales
v. Cunningham, 164 U. S. 612, 623, and United States v. Vigil,
10 Wall. 423. It is also conferred upon courts of the United
States by Rev. Stat. secs. 899, 900 and 901. This power,
however, must be distinguished from that discussed by the
court in Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410, wherein we held
that the authority of the court to set aside or modify an exist-

GAGNON v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

ing judgment or order ceased with the expiration of the term,
and from that time all final judgments and decrees passed beyond its control, and that if such errors existed they could only
be corrected by writ of error or appeal to a superior tribunal.
An exception was there made of certain mistakes of fact not
put in issue or passed upon, such as that a party died before"
judgment, or was a married woman, or was an infant and no
guardian appeared or was appointed, or that there was error
in the process through the default of the clerk. In the Federal
courts the power to amend is given in general language in the
final clause of Rev. Stat. section 954, which declares that such
courts "may at any time permit either of the parties to amend
any defect in the process or pleadings, upon such conditions
as it shall, in its discretion and by its rules, prescribe." As
above indicated, however, this power has been restricted to
amendments made during the progress of the case, or at least
during the continuance of the term in which the judgment is
rendered.
This power to amend, too, must not be confounded with the
power to create. It presupposes an existing record, which is
defective by reason of some clerical error or mistake, or the
omission or some entry which should have been made during
the progress of the case, or by the loss of some document
originally filed therein. The difference between creating and
amending a record is analogous to that between the construction and repair of a piece of personal property. If a house or
vessel, for instance, be burned or otherwise lost, it can only be
rebuilt, and the word "repair" is wholly inapplicable to its
subsequent reconstruction. The word "repair," as the word
"amend," contemplates an existing structure which has become imperfect by reason of the action of the elements, or
otherwise. In the cases of vessels particularly, this distinction
is one which cannot be ignored, as it lies at the basis of an
important diversity of Jurisdictipn between the common law
4 e-,/5"
and maritime courts. 7
The power to recreate a record, no evidence of which exists,

has been the subject of much discussion in the courts, and the
weight of authority is decidedly against the existence of such
power. We have examined a large number of authorities upon
this point, and while they do not altogether harmonize in their
conclusions, the practice in some States being much more rigid
than in others, we have found none which supports the contention that a record may be created to take the place of one
of which no written memorandum was made or entered at the
time the original judgment was supposed to have been rendered. The following cases contain instructive discussions
of the principles involved, but an epitome of them would
subserve no useful purpose. Bilansky v. Minnesota, 3 Minnesota, 427; Schoonover v. Reed, 65 Indiana, 313; Smith v. Hood
& Co., 25 Pa. St. 218; Missouri v. Primm, 61 Missouri, 166;
Brown v. Coward, 3 Hill (S. Car.), 4; Lynch v. Reynolds, 69
Kentucky, 547; Coughran v. Gutcheus, 18 Illinois, 390; Frink
v. Frink, 43 N. H. 508; Rugg v. Parker,7 Gray, 172; Balch v.
Shaw, 7 Cush. 282.
The power of the court to amend existing records is also
considered at length in the following cases from the Federal
courts: Tilghman v. Werk, 39 Fed. Rep. 680; Whiting v.
Equitable Life, 60 Fed. Rep. 197, 200; Odell v. Reynolds, 70
Fed. Rep. 656, 659; Blythe v. Hinckley, 84 Fed. Rep. 228, 244.
It may be gathered from these cases that, if a memorandum
be entered upon the calendar that a certain document has been
filed, such document, if lost, may be supplied by a copy in the
hands of counsel; or where a judgment or order has been entered upon the calendar, which does not appear upon the
journal, the court may order a new one to be entered mane pro
tune. In such cases there is often a memorandum of some
kind entered upon the calendar, or found in the files, and there
is no impropriety in ascertaining the fact even by parol evidence, and supplying the missing portion of the records. But
the exercise of a power to recreate a record where no memorandum whatever exists of such record is evidently a dangerous
one, and, although such power may have been occasionally

GAGNON v. UNITED STATES.
193 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

given by the legislature in cases of overwhelming necessity, as,
for instance, by the "lost record act" passed by the general
assembly of Illinois after the great fire in Chicago in 1871,
(Laws of Illinois, 1871-2, p. 650,) such power has not been
hitherto supposed to be inherent in courts of general jurisdiction. As the evidence upon which such restoration is made
cannot be inquired into, if the jurisdiction to recreate the record
exists, it might well happen that, upon the testimony of a single
interested witness, the court would order a new record to be
entered after a lapse, as in this case, of over thirty years, and
when the judge and clerk have .both died, and there was no
possibility of contradicting the testimony of such single witness.
Additional complications may also be properly referred to
in this case in the fact that the declaration of intention was
made before another court in another State, and that the
territorial court which is alleged to have entered the judgment
of naturalization had itself been abolished and a state court
substituted in its place. Did the jurisdiction exist to make
this order of naturalization, there is nothing to prevent any
person from applying to any competent court for a similar
judgment of naturalization, or even a judgment for damages,
and to have the same entered nunc pro tunc as of any date it
would be for his interest to have it rendered. It is true that
in this case notice was given to the Attorney General by the
petitioner of his proposed application to the court for the
restoration of "certain lost records," but if the jurisdiction to
enter this judgment nunc pro tunc did not exist, it could not
be given by this notice.
As there was no competent evidence of the citizenship of the
petitioner, there was no error in the action of the court below,
and its judgment is therefore

Affirmed.
