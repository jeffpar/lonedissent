Goods of Porter, L. R. 2 P. & D. 22, where Lold Penzance said,
if we correctly understand him, that if the only words adverse
to the will had been "should anything unfortunately happen
to me while abroad," he would not have held the will conditional. See In the Goods of Lllayd, 6 P. D. 17, 19.
On the other hand, we may cite the following cases as strongly
favoring the view which we adopt. It hardly is worth while to
state them at length, as each case must stand so much on its
own circumstances and words. The latest English decisions
which we have seen qualify the tendency of sonic of the earlier
ones. In the Goods of Mayd, 6 P. D. 17; In the Goods of Dobson,

THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD OF THE CITY OF
NEW YORK v. THE CITY OF NEW YORK.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITE)

STATES FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 150.

Argued January 29, February 23, 24, 190.-Decided March 21, 1901.

Where the sole ground on which the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. is invoked is that the case arises under the impairment of contract clause of
the Constitution of the United States, and the facts set up by complainants
are, as matter of law, wholly inadequate to establish any contract right*
as between them and the State, no dispute or controversy arises in respect
to an unwarranted invasion of such rights and the bill should be dismissed
for want of jurisdiction.
The mere filing of a map and profile, and the payment of the regular incorporation tax, by a company, organized under the general railroad law
of 1850 of New York, but which did not obtain the consents of municipal
authorities or of abutting property owners or substituted consent of the
Supreme Court, or acquire any property by condemnation, did not create

Argument for Appellant.

a contract with the State for the exclusive use of the space included in
the map and profile, and a subsequent act of the State authorizing the
construction of a railroad partly over the same route, does not violate
the impairment of contract clause of the Constitution of the United States.

THE facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. Roger Foster for appellant:
The Circuit Court had jurisdiction of the bill. All it is
necessary to show in order to secure a reversal of the decree
is that the complainants claim a franchise and that all of their
objections to the constitutionality of the Rapid Transit Act
are not so manifestly frivolous and without color of right as
conclusively to prove bad faith upon their part. Swafford v.
Templeton, 185 U. S. 487, 493, 494; Riverside & A. Ry. Co. v.
City of Riverside, 118 Fed. Rep. 736, 740; City Railway Co.
v. Citizens' Street R. R. Co., 166 U. S. 557, 563; Pacific El. Co.
v. Los Angeles, 118 Fed. Rep. 746, 752.
Having jurisdiction of the Federal question raised by the
bill, the court had also jurisdiction of the whole bill including
all questions that were not Federal. Omaha Horse Ry. Co. v.
Cable Tramway Co., 32 Fed. Rep. 727, 729; Louisville Trust
Co. v. Stone, (C. C. A.) 107 Fed. Rep. 305, 309, 310; Nashville

Donald, 165 U. S. 58, 71; Owensboro v. Owensboro Waterworks,
(C. C. A.) 115 Fed. Rep. 318, 320.
Where there is a single ingredient of Federal jurisdiction in
the case, the relief may be given upon other grounds although
the Federal question is decided adversely to the complainants.

100 U. S. 257, 264; Gold W. W. Co. v. Keyes, 96 U. S. 199, 203.
This is not a special rule of practice established for the sole
benefit of banks and railway companies chartered by Congress,
but it extends to all classes of cases. New Orleans Water Works

United States v. Union Pacific Ry. Co., 160 U. S. 1, 51.
It seems clear consequently, that so much of the bill that
seeks relief grounded upon fraud and mistake in execution of
the Rapid Transit contract, the breach of the same by the
contract or its invalidity because it creates a municipal indebtedness beyond the limitation of the state constitution is
sufficient to compel a decree in the complainant's favor.
The statute is unconstitutional because of its failure to provide adequate compensation for the property taken. Keene
v. Bristol, 26 Pa. St. 46; Sage v. Brooklyn, 89 N. Y. 189; Bloodgood v. Mohawk & Hudson R. R. Co., 18 Wend. (N. Y.) 9, 17,

Proprietorsv. Essex Co. Comrs., 103 Massachusetts, 120, 124;
Brickelt v. Haverhill Aqueduct Co., 142 Massachusetts, 394, 396.
The statute takes public funds for a private use and is not
due process of law. A decision sustaining the act logically
implies the power of the United States to build and operate
all railroads that engage in interstate commerce. Pleasant
Township v. Â£Etna Life Ins. Co., 138 U. S. 67; Rippe v. Becker,

Re Municipal Fuel Plants, 66 N. E. Rep. 24.
This is a Federal question. Loan Association v. Topeka,
20 Wall. 655.
The act takes property without due process of law by subjecting complainants to the payment of taxes for the expenses
of officers neither elected by the people, nor appointed by
representatives of the people, and gives to such officers control
of the complainants' business and of the city's money. A
majority of the quorum of the Rapid Transit Board have been
elected by the remainder of those appointed by the legislature.

Such a close corporation is unconstitutional. Fox v. M, & H.

89 N. W. Rep. 204, 208; State v. Fox, 63 N. E. Rep. 19.
The filing of the maps and profiles of their route gave to the
complainants and their predecessors a vested and exclusive
right thereto and the State then contracted not to interfere
with the same. Rochester H. & L. R. R. Co. v. N. Y., L. E.

The franchise is property which cannot be taken without
compensation and the obligation of that contract cannot be
impaired without a violation of the Constitution. City Railway Co. v. Citizens' Street R. R. Co., 166 U. S. 557; People v.

Argument for Respondents.

193 U. S.

Since the Rapid Transit Underground Railroad Company
was chartered less than five years before the bill was filed, it
cannot be claimed that its charter has been forfeited. The
defendants are estopped from claiming that the charters of
the other corporations have been forfeited. Coney Ihand &c.
R. R. Co. v. Kennedy, 15 App. Div. 588; Devereaux v. Brownsville, 29 Fed. Rep. 742.
Delay due to the inaction of the court is sufficiently excused. Hunt v. Smith, 3 Rich. Eq. (S. C.) 465, 511; Pendlcry

Matter of Kings County El. R. R. Co., 105 N. Y. 97.
No one but the Attorney General of the State can raise the
question of the forfeiture of the charter. Re N. 1'. El. R. Co.,

When the consent was granted by the court and municipal
authorities, it inured by relation to the corporation which had
the prior right to construct the street railroad. Ingersoll v.

As to the jurisdictional question:
The court below was without jurisdiction. Before there can
be any jurisdiction there must be a Federal question; and here
there is no such question, for the matter in dispute did not
arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States.
Defiance Water Co. v. Defiance, 191 U. S. 184, and cases cited

Co., 178 U. S. 239; New Orleans v. New Orleans TV. W. Co.,
142 U. S. 79, 88.

The court below in order to retain jurisdiction had to find
in the allegations of the bill a real and substantive Federal
question. Assuming the truth of the allegations of fact, some
contract with the State, real or apparent, must be made out.
New Orleans v. New Orleans Water Co., 142 U. S. 79, 88.
In cases of this character where this court has sustained the
jurisdiction, a contract has been established by sufficient allegations at the least. Illinois Central R. R. v. Chicago, 176
U. S. 646; Citizens' Railway Co. v. Citizens' Railroad Co., 166
U. S. 557.
Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487, and Wiley v. Linkler,
179 U. S. 58, merely distinguished cases where the subjectmatter of the suit was Federal-as plainly the subject-matter
of this suit is not-from cases which were like this suit, where
a Federal question has been held to be presented in a controversy over subject-matter not Federal.

brief on behalf of the city of New York and other respondents.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the court.

This was a bill filed on behalf of the Underground Railroad of

OCTOBER TERAM, 1903.
Opinion of the Court.

193 U. S.

the City of New York and the Rapid Transit Underground
Railroad Company, corporations organized under the laws of
New York, against the City of New York, the Mayor, the
Comptroller, and the Rapid Transit Commissioners of New
York, and contractors engaged in the construction of an underground railway and subway in that city, all of the State of
New York, to enjoin payment for work done and further
construction. The bill was demurred to for the reason, among
others, that the Circuit Court was without jurisdiction in fliat
the averments of the bill did not present a case arising under"
the Constitution or laws of the United States, which was the
sole ground on which jurisdiction was invoked. The demurrer
was sustained and the bill dismissed for want of jurisdiction,
116 Fed. Rep. 952, and, the question of jurisdiction being
certified, the case was brought directly to this court.
If, on the face of complainants' statement of their own ease,
it does not appear that the suit really and substantially involved a dispute or controversy as to the effect or construction
of the Constitution, on the determination of which the result
depended, the Circuit Court was right and its decree must be
affirmed. Defiance Water Company v. Defiance, 191 U. S. 18-1,
and cases cited.
The bill refers to the rapid transit acts of 1891, Laws, 1891,
c. 4, 1894, Laws, 1894, c. 752, and 1895, Laws, 1895, c. 519, and
sets forth their provisions for a rapid transit board einpowered
to construct an underground railroad in the city of New York;
fqr the submission to the electors of the city of the question
whether there should be municipal construction of railroads;
for the power of the board, in case a majority vote favored
municipal construction, to grant the right to maintain and
operate the municipal railroad for not less than thirty-ive
years nor more than fifty years; for the advance by the city
of the funds to construct the railroad; for the borrowing of
money and the issuing of bonds therefor; for the laying out
of the routes and the adoption of the plan of construction by
the board; for the requisite consent of the local authorities,

UNDERGROUND RAILROAD v. CITY OF NEW YORK. 423

Opinion of the Court.

consisting of the mayor and common council, and of a majority in value of the abutting owners, or, in lieu thereof, of the
Supreme Court of the State; for the various steps of procedure
after the popular vote in favor of municipal construction; and
for details of the contract for the construction and operation
of the municipal road.
The bill further alleges that the Rapid Transit Board had
determined on the construction of an underground railroad;
that the local authorities have duly given their consent and
that the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court has, on application of the board, appointed three commissioners to determine whether the railroad ought to be constructed and operated; that said commissioners have duly determined that it
ought to be; that their determination has been duly approved
by the court, and has been taken in lieu of the consent of the
property owners; that the city of New York, the municipal
authorities and board have entered into a contract, February,
1900, with defendant contractors, to construct the road over
the routes determined on, and that the railroad is now in
process of construction, and large sums of money have been
paid out by the city therefor.
But it is asserted that the complainants had a prior exclusive
right under contract with the State to the use for underground
railroad purposes of the streets now sought to be used for the
municipal rapid transit road, and that the legislation is in
conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, and section 10 of
article II of the Constitution.
No rights created by the Constitution are asserted, and if the
facts set up by complainants are, as matter of law, wholly
inadequate to show possession of contract rights as between
them, or either of them, and the State, then no dispute or controversy arises in respect of an unconstitutional invasion of
such rights.
The bill avers that the Underground Railroad of the city of
New York, one of the complainants, was formed August 21,
1896, by the consolidation of the Central Tunnel Railway

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

193 U. S.

Company, the New York and New Jersey Tunnel Railway
Company and the Terminal Underground Railway Company,
as to the two latter of which no claim is made and no question
arises.
And it alleges that the Central Tunnel Company was organized March 26, 1881, "under the so-called General Railroad
and Tunnel Law of the State of New York, namely, chapter
one hundred and forty of the Laws of 1850, and of the various
acts amendatory of and supplemental to the same, and
chapter five hundred and eighty-two of the Laws of 1880."
That company's articles of association declared its purpose
to be "constructing and maintaining and operating a railroad
for public use in the conveyance of persons and property."
Chapter 140 of the Laws of New York of 1850, as amended
by chapter 133 of the Laws of 1880, provided that railroad
corporations formed under it should possess in addition to
"the powers conferred on corporations in the third title of the
eighteenth chapter of the first part of the Revised Statutes,"
(which did not include power to construct railroads or to use
the streets of a city,) the power "to construct their road
across, along, or upon any

.

.

street, highway,

which the route of its road shall intersect or touch.
Nothing in this act contained shall be construed . . . to
authorize . . . the construction of any railroad not al-

ready located in, upon or across any streets in any city, without the assent of the corporation of such city." Laws, 1850,
pp. 211, 224; Laws, 1880, pp. 242, 244.
By chapter 10 of the Laws of 1860 it was provided: "It shall
not be lawful hereafter to lay, construct or operate any railroad
in, upon or along any or either of the streets or avenues of the
city of New York, wherever such railroad may commence or
end, except under the authority and subject to the regulations
and restrictions which the legislature may hereafter grant and
provide," (Laws, 1860, p. 16,) which was carried forward into
the charter of the city of New York of 1882. Laws, 1882,
c. 410, Â§ 1943. This was held by the Court of Appeals to

Opinion of the Court.

render the general railroad act inapplicable to the city of New
York. Matter of Washington &c. Railroad Company, 115 N. Y.
442.
The constitution of the State contained, by amendment
adopted in 1874, the following provision:
"But no law shall authorize the construction or operation of
a street railroad except upon the condition that the consent of
the owners of one-half in value of the property bounded on,
and the consent also of the local authorities having the control
of that portion of the street or highway upon which it is proposed to construct or operate such railroad be first obtained,
or in case the consent of such property owners cannot be obtained, the general term of the Supreme Court, in the district
in which it is proposed to be constructed, may, upon application, appoint three commissioners, who shall determine, after
a hearing of all parties interested, whether such railroad ought
to be constructed or operated, and their determination, confirmed by the court, may be taken in lieu of the consent of the
property owners."
This was continued by the constitution of 1894, which
changed the words "General Term" to "Appellate Division,"
and the word "district" to "department."
The Court of Appeals ruled in People v. O'Brien, 111 N. Y. 1,
that in order for a railroad corporation to acquire authority
to construct or operate a railroad upon the streets of any
municipality, not only the consent of the municipal authorities was indispensable, but that they were empowered to
grant such consent on such terms and conditions as they
chose to impose.
The first section of chapter 582 of the Laws of 1880, provided:
"Whenever such road, or any part of the same, is intended
to be built within the limits of any city or incorporated village
of this State and to run by means of a tunnel underneath any
of the streets, roads or public places thereof, the said company,
before building the same underneath any of said streets, roads
or public places, shall obtain the consent of the owners of one-

half in value of the property bounded on the line, and the
consent of the board of trustees of the village by resolution
adopted at a regular meeting and entered on the records of
said board, and of the proper authorities having control of said
streets, roads or public places; or in case such consent of the
owners of property bounded on the line cannot be obtained,
the general term of the Supreme Court in the district in which
such city or village is situated may, upon application, appoint
three commissioners who shall determine, after a hearing of
all parties interested, whether such railroad ought to be allowed
to be built underneath said street, roads and public places, or
any of them,

.

.

.

and the determination by said com-

missioners, confirmed by the court, may be taken in lieu of the
consent of said authorities and property owners." Laws, 1880,
p. 872.
In Matter of New York District Railway Company, 107 N. Y.
42, decided in 1887, the Court of Appeals held that qtreet underground roads were street railways and that the constitutional
provision applied to them; that the act of 1850 had no application to street railroads, and, if it had, the authority to construct had been taken away by the act of 1860; and that the
provision of the act of 1880, allowing the action of the Supreme
Court commissioners to stand in the place of the consent of the
municipal authorities was unconstitutional, and also as to the
consent of the abutting owners, because indivisible; but that
perhaps the act might stand as authority for the construction
of an underground street railway on condition of the assent,
of the city authorities and the half of abutting values, rejecting
all the provisions for the appointment of commissioners.
It follows that the Central Terminal Company could have
acquired no right to build the proposed railroad without the
consent of the municipal authorities and the consent of the
abutting property owners, yet no such consents are asserted
to have been given it, and the contrary appears on the face of
the bill.

But after setting forth the provisions for a rapid

transit board by the Rapid Transit Act of 1891, as amended,

UNDERGROUND
193 U. S.

RAILROAD v. CITY OF NEW YORK. 427
Opinion of the Court.

especially in 1894, and the proceedings thereunder, which
showed that the consent of the municipal authorities and of
the Supreme Court in lieu of the property owners had been
given to the municipal construction sought to be enjoined,
the bill argues that the determination and consents in favor
of such municipal construction amounted to authority to construct the railroad of the Central Tunnel Company because it
was an underground railroad, which it had been proposed
should occupy the same route or part of it, notwithstanding
the railroad of that company had not been consented to by
either the local authorities or the abutting property owners
of the Supreme Court acting for them.
We quite agree with the Circuit Court that this contention
is wholly inadmissible. The determination of the Rapid Transit Board and the consents of the municipal authorities and
the abutting owners to municipal construction could not be
regarded as enuring to the benefit of private parties who had
endeavored to acquire the franchise twenty years before and
had failed to perform the conditions essential to the right to,
construct such a road.
The bill also avers that the consent of the abutting property
owners could not be obtained by the Central Tunnel Company,
and that the company applied to the General Term of the
Supreme Court for the appointment of three commissioners,
and that on February 2, 1883, commissioners were appointed,
one of whom declined to serve, whereupon the court appointed
another commissioner, who also declined to serve; that the
company thereupon applied for another appointment, and
"said application was duly granted by said court;" but that
the said General Term and its successor, the Appellate Division, had not yet entered said order, and that, by reason of the
inaction of the Supreme Court, the Central Tunnel Company
and its successor, the Underground Railroad Company, had
not been able to continue the proceedings before commissioners, and neither of said corporations had been able to
commence the construction of its line of railroad. If this

imputation of laches could in any view be entertained it is
enough to say that the General Term in 1886 adj udged the act
of 1880, under which the application was made, to be unconstitutional in respect of obtaining consents, illatter of New
York District Railway Company, 42 Hun, 621, and, as already
mentioned, this decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
107 N. Y. 42.
The general railroad law of 1850 provided for the filing of a
map and profile of the proposed route, and this was (lone by
the Central Tunnel Company, March 28, 1882, and the bill
claims that thereby the company obtained a contract right.
But the mere filing of a map and profile by a company incorporated under that law could not give an exclusive right to the
occupancy of the space included in such map and profile as
against the State. In some instances it might give priority as
between railroad corporations, whose corporate existence had
not lapsed for non-construction, but only until the legislature
otherwise provided. And so it was held in People v. Adirondack Railway Company, 160 N. Y. 225, where, among other
things, it was observed: "There is no property in a naked
railroad route, existing on paper only, that the State is oblige(I
to pay for when it needs the land covered by that route for a
great public use, and its officers are authorized to act by appropriate legislation." The judgment was affirmed by this
court in Adirondack Railway Company v. New York Sate, 176
U. S. 335, and we said:
"But the capacity to acquire land by condemnation for the
construction of a railroad attends the franchise to be a railroad
corporation, and when unexecuted cannot be held to be in
itself a vested right surviving the existence of the franchise
or an authorized circumscription of its scope. .
"We agree with the Court of Appeals, as has already been
indicated, that the railroad company occupies no position
entitling it to raise the question. The steps it had taken had
not culminated in the acquisition of any property or vested
right."

UNDERGROUND RAILROAD v. CITY OF NEW YORK. 429
193 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Where certain routes have been determined according to
law, and the necessary consents have been obtained, and real
estate has been acquired by condemnation, the situation would
be entirely different. Suburban Rapid Transit Company v.
Mayor, 128 N. Y. 510. But without the consents the right to
construct and operate could not become vested. In Matter of
Application of the Rochester Electric Railway Company, 123
N. Y. 351.
The Underground Railroad, one of the complainants, was,
as before stated, formed by the consolidation of the Central
Tunnel Company with two other companies under chapter 676
of the Laws of 1892, which provided for the consent of the
proper city authorities and of the owners of one-half in value
of the abutting property, or, as to the latter, the determination
of commissioners affirmed by the Supreme Court. Neither of
these consents is alleged to have been obtained.
It is averred, however, that the company paid; when its
articles of consolidation and incorporation were filed in August,
1896, the incorporation tax of one-eighth of one per cent on its
capital stock, required to be paid by chapter 908 of the Laws
of 1896; but the payment of a tax for the privilege of being a
corporation did not carry with it the right to occupy any street
of New York with its proposed railroad.
And the fact, also asserted, that this company filed a map
or profile did not, as we have seen, in itself create a contract
right.
The company is alleged to have leased its road to the Rapid
Transit Underground Railroad Company, the other complainant, which was incorporated in 1897, subject to the rapid
transit law of the State and the railroad law under which it
was incorporated. The consent of the municipal authorities
and the consent of the abutting property owners, or the substituted consent of the Supreme Court, were essential to the
right to construct a railroad, and these it never obtained. It
paid the incorporation tax under the tax law of 1896, but that
gave no right of construction, nor did its filing of a map or
