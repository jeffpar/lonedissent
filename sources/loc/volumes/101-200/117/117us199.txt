JOHNSON v. KEITH.
Opimon of the Court.

JOHNSON v. KEITH & Another.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MSSOURI.
Submitted March 2, 1886.-Decided March 8, 1888.

A judgment of reversal in a State court, accompanied by an order remanding
the cause for a retrial, is not a final judgment for the purpose of a writ of
error to this court.
Bostwick v. Brnkerkoff, 106 U. S. 4, affirmed.

This was a motion to dismiss a writ of error "because the
record and mandate of the said Supreme Court of Missouri in
this cause, brought up by such writ of error, shows on the face
thereof that no final judgment or decree was rendered or made
in this cause by said Supreme Court of Missouri, but on the
contrary thereof, it appears from such record and mandate,
that the judgment and decree of the inferior court, to wit
The said Circuit Court of Lafayette County, Missouri, was, by
such Supreme Court of Missouri, reversed, and that this cause
was by such Supreme Court of Missouri remanded to the said
Circuit Court of Lafayette County, Missouri, for further proceedings to be had therein, in conformity with the opinion of
said Supreme Court of Missouri in this cause delivered. Such
writ of error was prematurely and improvidently sued out and
issued."
