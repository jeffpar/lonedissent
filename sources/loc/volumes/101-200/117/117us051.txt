poration, and had no domlcil in Tennessee, and the sleeping
cars in question, as before said, had not any situs in Tennessee
for the purposes of taxation.
The question involved in this case was before the Court of
Chancery of Tennessee in Pullman &out/ern Car Co. v
Gasnes, 3 Tenn. Ch. 587, on the same facts, as to the privilege
tax for 1871. That court held (and it is stated that the Supreme Court of Tennessee, on appeal, affirmed its ruling), that
this privilege tax, as to such of the cars as passed and repassed
through the State, and did not abide in it, was-not amenable
to the objection that it interfered with inter-State commerce.
The view taken was that the property of the foreign corpora,
tion, used in Tennessee, could be taxed as property or by an
excise on its use, and that the tax in this case was not directly
on the object of commerce, or directly aimed at commerce.
We have given to the views set forth by the Tennessee Chancery Court the consideration due to the judgments of that tribunal, but are unable to concur in its conclusion.

Syllabus.

Davidson County, Tennessee, on December 15, 1883, by the
State of Tennessee, against the Pullman Southern Car Company, a Kentucky corporation. The questions involved are the
same as those disposed of in .Ptkardv The PullmanSouthern Car Co., ante, 34. The bill sets forth the act of Tennessee
of M arch 16,1877, and alleges that from 1877 the company had
run sixty sleeping cars instead of thirty-eight each year, and
ought to have paid as a privilege tax for each car for each of
the years 1877, 1878, 1879, and 1880, $50, malting $12,000,
whereas it had paid only $7276.41, and that by an act passed
April 7, 1881, Laws of 1881, ch. 149, 202, the privilege taxwas
increased to $75 a year, for each car, making due for the years
1881 and 1882, $9000. The bill prays for a discovery, and an
account, and for judgment.
The defendant removed the suit into the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Middle District of Tennessee, and then
answered the bill. The answer raises the same questions which
were adjudged in the other suit, and on the same facts. The
case was heard on bill and answer. The decree gave a recovery
for $300 and interest for the taxes for 1881 and 1882 on the two
cars which ran wholly within Tennessee, but dismissed the bill
in all other respects. The plaintiff appealed to this court from
all of the decree except that part which awarded a recovery
For the reasons assigned in the opinion in the other suit, the decree in this case is
Aflirmed.
