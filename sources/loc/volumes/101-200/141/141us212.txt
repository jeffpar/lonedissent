M .. CiEF JUSTIoE FULLER

delivered the opinion of the

court.
The motion by appellant for leave to dismiss its appeal in
this cause is accompanied by certain correspondence which is
referred to as stating the grounds on which the motion is
made. We cannot be called upon to examine into these
papers for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion as to
whether the dismissal is justifiable or not, and must decline to
permit them to be filed and to thereby leave it to be inferred
hereafter that we may have acted upon them. Appellant
undoubtedly has the right to dismiss its appeal with the leave
of the court, and may renew its motion to that effect unacconpamed by other matter, and the order of disnissal will be
entered.
.Mr Asszstant Attorney General .Maury thereupon withdrew the papers, and renewed the motion without'them, and
the appeal was ordered to be
