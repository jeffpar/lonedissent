FOWLER v. EQUITABLE TRUST COMPANY (2)
EQUITABLE TRUST COMPANY v. FOWLER. (2)
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.
Nos. 34, 35.

Argued April 16, 17, 1891. - Decided October 26,1891.

The decision below in these cases is reversed on the authority of Fowler
v. Equitable Trust Company, ante, 384.
THE

court stated the case as follows.

The Trust Company made a loan to Rose H. Fowler, a citizen of Illinois, of the sum of $6000, for'five years, with interest
at the rate of ten per cent per annum, payable semi-annually
The latter executed to the company six coupon bonds of $1000
each, dated May 1, 1874, payable May 1, 1879, with interest
semi-annually at the rate of seven per cent per annum, the
principal and interest payable at the office of the company in
New York. As security for the payment of the bonds and the
interest thereon, the borrower conveyed to Jonathan Edwards,
trustee, a lot in Springfield, Illinois, with the appurtenances
thereon. The deed was sinilar in its provisions to the one
given in the preceding cases, Nos. 32 and 33.
The present suit was brought October 27, 1882, to foreclose
the grantor's right and equity of redemption, and for a sale in
satisfaction of the amount found, upon an accounting, to be
due the Trust Company Sophie Fowler was made a defendant
upon the ground that she claimed some interest in the mortgaged property She filed an answer and cross-bill, to which,

the company filed a replication and answer. By a decree
entered October 20, 1884, it was adjudged by the court that
the plaintiff was entitled to recover $2162.48 as the balance of
the principal actually received by the defendants, $23.12 for
insurance paid, in all, $2185.60.
When this decree was
entered the defendants filed a written motion and petition for
rehearing, in respect to which the same proceedings were had
as in the preceding cases. A formal order for rehearing was
made June 30, 1885, and entered as of October 31, 1884, and
there was a final decree, January 11, 1887, in favor of plaintiff
for $5411.23, of which $5381.83 was found to be the principal
sum actually received by the defendants, and $29.40 to have
been paid for insurance. From that decree both parties appealed.
In reference to the loan in question, Johnston, the local
agent of the company at Springfield, through whom the loan
was obtained, testified "The trust deed and bonds were executed and delivered to me about the 22d day of June, 1874, as
complete. This was a loan of six thousand at ten per cent.
Seven per cent of the interest was evidenced by the interest
coupons attached to the six one-thousand dollar bonds, and
the remaining three per cent was discounted for the five years
and deducted from the $6000. The trust deeds and bonds in
this case bear date the 1st day of May, 1874, and the interest
which accrued on them from May 1, 1874, to June 23, 1874,
was'paid to the defendant.

defendant his sight Braft on the Trust Company, which was
negotiated by her. Pursuant to a previous agreement with
him, she paid him a commission of $150. The evidence as to

the circumstances under which the loan was made, and commissions paid, and of Johnston's relations to the Trust Company, was the same as in the other cases.

JusTIcE HARLA,

for

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
These appeals are from the same decree. The cases arise
under the usury laws of Illinois. They do not differ materially
from Nos. 32 and 33, except as to the amount of the loan.
The answer raises the same questions as were raised in. those
cases. The decree gave no credit on the principal sum for
payments on account of interest, but was for the amount actually received by the borrower in cash, and the sum paid by
the mortgagee for insurance, with interest on the aggregate
amount at six per cent from the date of its rendition. Under
the statute of Illinois relating to interest upon the loan or forbearance of money, and for the reasons given in the opinion
in cases Nos. 32 and 33, the loan in question must be held to
have been usurious, and the decree should have been in conformity with the principles announced in those cases.
The decree is
Reversed wzth costs, and the cause w remanded with nstructions to make such modifications mr the decree as will be
conststent with th s opTinon.
