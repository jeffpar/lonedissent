WILLCOX & GIBBS SEWING MACHINE COMPANY
v. EWING.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
No. 64. Argued October 29, 1891.-De,:ided November 16, 1891.

A contract of agency, which leaves the agent free to terminate his relations
with the principal upon reasonable notice, must be construed to confer
the same right upon the principal, unless provisions to the contrary are
stipulated.
A provision -in a contract, otherwise terminable upon reasonable notice, that
a violation of the spirit of the agreement shall be a sufficient cause for
its abrogation, does not imply that it can bo abrogated only for sufficient
cause.
The plaintiff in error by contract appointed the defendant in error ,,its
exclusive vendor" for its machines in a defined territory; agreed to sell
the machines to him at a large discount from its retail New York prices;
and not to "knowingly supply its goods at a discount to go within that
territory." The defendant in error accepted the appointment; agreed' to
pay for'he machines at the discount rate; not to sell them below the said
retail rate; and not to solicit orders within the territory of other agents.
Held, that the agreement constituted him agent within the defined terrtory.

THE court stated the case as follows

were sustained by the defendant in error, Ewing, on account
of an alleged breach of a written contract between him and
the Willcox and Gibbs Sewing Machine Company, -the plaintiff in error, of date October 15, 1874. The case depends upon
the construction of that contract.
On the 16th of May, 1867, the parties entered into a written
agreement, reciting that the company's "agency" for Philadelphia and vicinity had been conducted by Ewing, and that
a settlement of accounts had been made whereby the assets of
such agency had been transferred to him. In view of that
settlement, and to secure the interests cf both parties, it was
agreed, for considerations mutually satisfactory, that the company should furnish Ewing such Willcox and Gibbs sewing
machines as he might order, at a discount of forty per cent
from its list price so long as the list remained unchanged, and
three dollars per machine in addition to that forty per cent,
that whenever the price was changed due notice was to be
given Ewing, and a discount made upon the basis of the then
cost of a machine to the company and its then retail price,
which should bear the same proportion that the above discount
and three dollars per machine bore to such cost and retail
price, and that parts of, and attachments to, the machines
should be furnished at a discount of forty per cent, and cabmet work, needles and any attachments that cost the company
more than sixty per cent of its retail price, at net cost. In
consideration of the premises Ewing agreed to continue the
business, then established in Philadelphia, of the sale of these
sewing machines, and, in good faith, to devote his entire time
and energy to its advancement and improvement, and to the
increase of the sale of the machines, as fully and energetically
as he had done the previous year, and so long as he faithfully
did so and in good faith kept at least the sum of $25,000 actively employed therein, the company "agreed to continue,
and in equal good faith, carry out all the provisions" of the
agreement.
The company agreed to convey to Ewing, by proper writing,
the lease of the property in Philadelphia in which.the business
was then carried on, to be used for the purposes stated in the

WILLCOX & GIBBS CO. v. EWING.
Statement of the Case.

contract. In consideration of the premises, and so long as
Ewing faithfully performed the agreement on his part, he
was to have the exclusive sale of the Willcox and Gibbs sewing machine, its attachments and parts, in certain defined portions of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia and Ohio;
the company reserving the right to sell their machines and
accessories at their retail prices only to go into such territory
It was also provided that "the agency, or, in other words,
the interest in the Willcox and Gibbs sewing machine business" conveyed to Ewing was not to be sold or assigned by
him without the company's consent, but such consent was to
be given if the party was acceptable to it.
On the day of the execution of the above agreement the
company gave this receipt "iReceived from Daniel S. Ewing,
of Philadelphia, twenty-five thousand three hundred and
ninety-eight -a dollars, which is the balance due this company from the Philadelphia office to the 15th inst., the payment of which by the said D. S. Ewing transfers to him all our
interest in the stock, fixtures, book ac., etc., of said office."
Under the date of October 15, 1874, the parties signed a
memorandum, in which it was stipulated that a new agreement should be entered into between them containing certain
specified terms, "the making of which it is hereby understood
shall nullify all former contracts and agreements made prior 1'
to that date. This writing closed with these words "Above
is substantially our mutual understanding of what the new
contract is to be." On the same day the new contract -the
one in suit - was reduced to writing and signed. It does
not vary from the memorandum of the same date in any respect material to the present controversy As the case
depends upon the construction of the last agreement, it is
given in full, as follows:
"This agreement, made and entered into this fifteenth day
of October, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, by
and between the Willcox and Gibbs Sewing Machine Company, a corporation duly organized under the laws of the
State of New York, of the first part, and Daniel S. Ewing, of
the city of Philadelphia, Penn., of the second part, witnesseth

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Statement of the Case.

"The first party hereby appoints, subject to conditions
hereinafter expressed, the second party its exclusive vendor
for its sewing machines, parts and attachments, in and for the
following-named territory, to wit the city of Philadelphia,
Pa. and the adjacent country lying within a radius of ten
miles from the city hall of said city The second party hereby
accepts said appointment. The first party will sell for the
present to second party its sewing machines and parts thereof
at 60 per cent discount from its present New York retail price
list, and its needles, attachments, silk and cotton at its lowest
wholesale rates. In the event of a change (the liberty to
effect which is not herein intended to be restricted) in retail
prices or of a general revision of discounts by first party, the
second party is to be as favorably considered then in the readjusting and fixing of discount rates to him as is extended to
him on present basis of prices. All bills owing from second
to first party shall be paid in cash 30 days from date of same.
The first party will not knownigly supply its goods at a discount to go within the limits of territory hereby assigned,
but the first party reserves the right always to sell its sewing
machines, parts and accessories at full retail rates to go anywhere. The established retail prices of first party are to be
maintained for retail trade, and the second party is bound to
sustain them and will bind all subvendors or agents of his to
sustain said established retail prices. Second party will be
allowed to fill orders from any locality at full list rates, but
trade must not be solicited by his connivance or consent in
the territory of other agents, and discounts or any equivalent
device therefor must not be allowed in any form on articles
herein specified permitted to go out of his owa territory Machines or parts, needles or attachments counterfeiting, infringing or in any degree trespassing upon ours, or in any effect
trading upon our name, must not be dealt in or countenanced
by second party, but it is hereby agreed that his time, attention and abilities must primarily be devoted to the forwarding of the interest of the party of the first part. If, for any
reason, at any time the connection hereby formed shall cease,
the first party shall have the right to buy back of its goods

sold to second party all such goods as first party may select,
first party to pay therefor same prices as charged second
party
"Second party agrees to purchase from first party during
the year 1875 at least $20,000, net, worth of machines, parts
and accessories, to be taken in equal monthly parts, and to be
paid for as stated herein. Violation of the spirit of this
agreement shall be sufficient cause for its abrogation. Permission is granted second party to trade in all former territory
occupied by him until such time as first party shall form other
connections for occupying the territory not contained in that
designated therein as belonging to second party
"And it is agreed and understood that this appointment or
agency is not salable or transferable by second party without
obtaining the written consent of first party, but such consent
is to be given providing the purchaser or other person is
acceptable to said first party First party consents to renew
and extend second party's note, $10,000, maturing January
23-26, 1875, for one year from said date, without interest,
upon consideration of this agreement alone. All contracts or
agreements made prior to the date first written above are
hereby nullified and satisfied."
Subsequently, February 15, 1877, Ewing executed the following receipt, which was endorsed on the contract " Received,
New York, Feb'y 15, 1877, the sum of four hundred and.
twenty 52 dollars, making the discount up to 55 per cent on
all goods received by me since the revision of discounts in
August, 1875, same amount being in full for all claims or
demands for arrears of discounts, allowances or any, other
claims I may have up to date hereof. In consideration whereof
I also now confirm the within contract, admitting the company's right to revise discounts or prices as in its judgment it
may deem proper and just, in conformity with the within contract. D. S. Ewing."
The parties continued to act under the agreement of 1874
until the latter part of 1879. On the 10th day of October of
the latter year the company notified Ewing of their purpose
to abrogate their agreement at the expiration of sixty days

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Statement of the Case.

from that date, saying "In the meantnne,'the company will
be ready and willing to take off your hands the store now
-occupied by you, and they will purchase, if you desire to sell,
the fixtures contained in the store at a just valuation. They
will also purchase all stock which you have on hand which
has been obtained from the said company, in accordance with
the terms of their contract. Should you be desirous of terminating the said agreement at an earlier period than the
time herein designated, the company will join with you in an
agreement for such earlier termination of the contract." In
reply to this notice, Ewing wrote to the company "I do not
accept notice for the abrogation of the contract existing between us, for the reason that I deny your right thus, or by
any arbitrary process, to determine said contract. Should
.you wish to open negotiations for the purchase of any thing,
right or privilege which I hold, that may be of value to you,
I shall be pleased to receive communications bearing upon the

subject."
At the trial of the present action, brought to recover
dhmages for .breach by the company of the contract of 18.74,
Ewing introduced the agreement of 1867, and gave evidence
tending to show the value of the business in that and succeeding years, his faithful performance of the contract, and the
,damages he had sustained by reason of the alleged breach.
To the introduction of that evidence the company objected,
but the objection was overruled, and an exception taken. The
defendant did not introduce any proof, but insisted at the trial
and insists here, that it appeared from the evidence that
Ewing, prior to the abrogation of the contract, did not give
his time and labor, primarily, for the benefit- of its business in
his hands.
The defence was based, in part, upon the broad ground that
the contract of 1874 was revocable at the will of the company,
or, at least, upon reasonable notice to Ewing; and, as by the
uncontradicted evidence sixty days' notice was given of the
purpose to abrogate it. that the law was for the company

in substance, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover any

I. The contract in suit was one of sale, not of agency
The right conferred upon Ewing was analogous to that conferred upon the licensee of a patent. The nature of such
licensee's right has been very clearly considered by this court
recently in the case of St. Paul Plow Works v Starling, 140
U. S. 184.
Ewing was not constituted an agent to sell on behalf of the
defendant, for its account, its machines. It was made his duty
to purchase for himself, and to pay for, the machines which
he desired to sell. The defendant agreed with him that it
would furnish to him, to be sold by him, for his own account,
within a designated territory, its machines. It further agreed
that within said territory he alone should be allowed to sell
the same.
It seems too plain for argument that the agreement by the
defendant with the plaintiff was one of sale and not of agency
It not only conferred upon the latter the right to seh, but it
excluded others from selling.
Was this agreement one of sale only so long as the defendant desired to sell, or one to sell to him without limit of time
The agreement by Ewing "to purchase from first party
during the year 1875 at least $20,00 net worth of machines,
parts and accessories to be taken n equal monthly parts and
to be paid for as stated herein," was not one which it was
competent for the defendant at will to revoke. This agreement, by itself, is sufficient to show that the provision was

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

one, not at will, but for a time, and for a time not terminable
with the year 1875.
Inasmuch as the contract was not to be at will, it was to
have some duration. The least extent which can be given it
is for the life of Ewing, or during the continuance in business
of the defendant. An agreement to run for some time, not
limited, cannot be otherwise construed.
II. The contract of 1867 was properly admitted in evidence.
The contract of 1867 was admissible in evidence not only as
throwing some light upon the question of the value of the
contract broken, but also for the purpose of showing the facte
that the agreement of 1874 rested upon a consideration.
The contract of 1874 stated that "All contracts or agreements made prior to the first date written above are hereby
nullified and satisfied."
It was the right of the jury to know that a consideration
had been given. It was impossible to correctly understand
the relation established by the contract of 1874 without a
knowledge of the situation. It was not claimed that the contract of 1867 was admissible to modify, to alter, or to vary
that of 1874, but simply to show that the parties had dealt
together previously about the same subject matter, and that
the new agreement grew out of such past relation. Though
the learned judge did not admit the contract of 1867 for this
purpose, we submit that he should have done so.
III. The value paid to the defendant by the plaintiff for
the exclusive right to sell its sewing machines in 1867, in connection with the oral testimony, was pertinent to the issue
raised as to the amount of damages due the plaintiff.

after stating the case, delivered the

If this action was based upon the agreement of 1867, there
would be some ground for holding that the company was
obliged, by that agreement, to continue Ewing as agent so
long as he performed its stipulations. We are only concerned,
however, with the agreement of 1874, which materially differs

WILLCOX & GIBBS CO. v. EWING.
Opinion of'the Court.

from that of 1867, and expressly provides that all prior contracts between the parties "are hereby nullified and satisfied."
It is only for a breach of the contract of 1874. the plaintiff
sues. Looking at all the provisions of the last agreement, it
is clear that Ewing - although bound, while the contract was
in force, to devote his time, attention and abilities, primarily, to
the interests of the company, within the territory allotted to
him-was not compelled to continue in its service foi any
given number of years, at least after 1875, or indefinitely, but,
-was at liberty after that year, if not before, upon reasonable
notice, to' surrender his position and quit its service, subject to
the company's right to buy back such of its goods sold to him
as it might select, and for the prices at which they were
charged to him. He may have been entirely satisfied with
the manner in which the company acted towards him, and yet
may have preferred - it is immaterial for what reason - not
to remain in its service after 1875, or to continue in the business of selling sewing machines. We specify the year 1875,
because Ewing agreed to purchase, during that year, $20,000
of .the-company's machines. But he did not bind himself to
purchase any given number during subsequent years. It would
be a very hard interpretation of the contract to hold that he
was bound by the agreement of 1874 to serve the company
within the designated territory so long as it kept the contract,
and was satisfied with him as its agent. None of its provisions
wouldjustify such an interpretation.
If Ewing had the privilege, upon reasonable notice, of severing the connection between him and the company after 1875,
upon what ground could a like privilege be denied the cofipamy
if it desired to dispense with his services 2 He contends that
his life, or the continuance of the company in business, was
the shortest duration of the contract, consistently with its provisions, provided he did his duty This position is untenable.
His appointment was made and accepted subject to the conditions expressed in the agreement. No one of those conditions
is to the effect that so long as he devoted his time, attention
and abilities to the company's business, he should retain his
,position as its exclusive vendor, within the territory named,

OCTOBER TER.M, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

without regard to its wishes. If the parties intended that
their relations should be of that character, it was easy to have
so s.aipulated. The only part of the contract that gives color
to the theory for which the plaintiff contends, is the part declaring that a violation of the spirit of the agreement "shall
be sufficient cause for its abrogation." This clause, it may be
suggested, was entirely unnecessary if the parties retained the
right to abrogate the conteact after 1875, at pleasure, and
implies that it could be abrogated only for sufficient cause, of
which, in case of suit, the jury, under the guidance of the court
as to the law, must judge in the light of all the circumstances.
We cannot concur in this view The clause referred to is not
equivalent to a specific provision declaring, affirmatively, that
the contract should continue in force, for a given number of
years, or without limit as to time, unless abrogated by one or
the other party for sufficient cause. It was inserted by way
of caution, to indicate that the parties were bound to observe
equally the spirit and the letter of the agreement while it was
in force.
There was some discussion at the bar as to whether Ewing
was, strictly, an agent of the company We think he was.
Ile was none the less an agent because of his appointment as
"exclusive vendor" of the defendant's machines within a particular territory, or because of the peculiar privileges granted
to or the peculiar restrictions imposed upon him. One clause
of the contract prohibits him from soliciting trade, directly or
indirectly, in the territory "of other agents," another, that
he will bind "all sub-vendors or agents" to sustain the established retail prices of the company, and still another imposes
restrictions upon. the sale of his "appointment or agency"
The agreement constituted him the sole agent of the company for the sale of its machines within a certain territory
It is true that the machines he undertook to sell were to be
,purchased by him from the company at a large discount.
But he could not sell them by retail below the regular retail
prices. This arrangement was the mode adopted to protect
the company's interests, and to secure the plaintiff such coinpensation for his services as would induce hun co devote his

WILLCOX & GIBBS CO. v. EWING.
Opinion of the Court.

time, attention and abilities to the company's interests. He
was still a mere agent to sell such machines as might be delivered to him under the contract. We perceive. nothing in the
agreement of 1874 to take the case out of the general rule
that "the principal has a right to determine or revoke the
authority given to his agent at his own mere pleasure, for,
since the authority is conferred by his mere will, and is to be
executed for his own benefit and his own purposes, the agent
cannot insist upon acting when the principal has withdrawn
his confidence, and no longer desires his aid." Story on
Agency, §§ 462, 463. So far as the company's power of revocation is concerned, the case is not materially different from
what it would be if the plaintiff had agreed to sell such
machines as were delivered to him at the established retail
prices, receiving, as compensation for his services, the difference between those prices and the amount he agreed to pay for
them under the contract of 1S74. In either case, -his relation
to the company would be one of agency, that could be terminated at its will or by renunciation upon his part, at least after
1875. Of course the revocation by the principal of the agent's
authority could not injuriously affect existing contracts made
by the latter under the power originally conferred upon him.
For the reasons stated the court below erred in not instructing the jury, as requested, to return a verdict for the defendant.
