Tins appeal brought up for review a judgment by the Court
of Claims sustaining a demurrer to a petition filed by the appellant, in which he claimed as due him from the United States

WINGARD v. UNITED STATES.
Dissenting Opinion. Field, Gray, Brown, JJ.

I dissent from. the judgment of the court in this case, on the
grounds stated in my dissenting opinion in .XoAllister v.
United States.
I may also add to those grounds the fact that, by the laws
of .the United States applicable to all the Territories, it is provided that for each Territory there shall be appointed a Governor, a Secretary, a Chiet Justice and two Associate Justices
of its Supreme Court, an Attorney and a Marshal, and that
their terms shall be four-years and until their successors are
appointed and qualified, with this difference that it is declared
with reference to all the officers, except the Justices of the
Supreme Court, that they shall hold their offices for that term,
unless sooner removed by the President, but that qualification
is not added to the term of the Justices. (Rev. Stat. ยง 1841,
1843, 1864, 1875, 1876, 1877.)
It is also to be observed that the acts of Congress organizing
the different Territories of the United States, and providing
for judicial tribunals therein, from the foundation of the government down to the present time, with. three exceptions, have
fixed the term of the judicial officers of the Territories at
definite periods absolutely, without any conditions, 'or simply
with the condition "upon good behavior." In two of these
exceptions where the words "unless sooner removed" are
added, the power of removal is not vested in the President,
but left to be exercised under the general law of the country
applicable to such officers; that is, by impeachment or by the
joint action of the President and Congress, after full opportu-nityis given to the accused of being heard upon the grounds
of complaint. In the third exception the words added, ar?"
"unless sooner removed by the President with the consent of
the Senate of the Unitect States," which implies a previous
consideration iby the Senate of the grounds of removal, and
this would usually be accompanied with notice to the accused
and an opportunity afforded to him-of being heard thereon.1

for all, the Territories:
