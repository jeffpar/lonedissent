ST. LOUIS, IRON MOUNTAIN AND SOUTHERN
RAILWAY COMPANY v. JOHNSON.
APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS.
Fos. 60, 71. Argued October 30, 1891.

Decided November 16,1891.

Under a written contract J. was to build a road for a railroad company for
$29,000, and to have possession of the road and run and use it till he should
be paid. He completed the road, but was not paid, and, while in possession, was forcibly ejected by the company. In an action against it for
forcible entry and detainer he had judgment. Meantime, another company purchased the road, but before that, by a written agreement
between J. and the first company, the amount due him under the contract
was fixed at $25,000. The judgment was affirmed by this court, but
before any judgment was entered on its mandate, the second company
tendered to J. the $25,000 and interest, which he refused, and it then filed
a bill in equity, for a perpetual injunction against J. from taking possession of the road, and obtained an order for a temporary injunction,
on paying the money tendered, into a depository of the court, to its
credit, with the right to J. to receive the money when he pleased. J. defended the suit on the ground, that the agreement as to the $25,000 was
conditional and temporary and that the condition had not been fulfilled.
The court decreed that on the plaintiff's paying into court the costs of the
suit, and $1000 for the expenses of J. in preparing to take possession of
the road, a perpetual injunction should issue. Both parties appealed.
Held,
(1) The agreement as to the $25,000 was binding on J., and its terms
could not be varied, by showing a contemporaneous verbal understanding that the $25,000 was to be paid in cash in a limited time;
(2) The tender and the payment into court changed the condition of
affairs, and the right of J. to possession of the road ceased,
(3) The case was distinguishable from that of Ballance v. Forsyth, 24
How. 183, and like that of Parker v. The Judges, 12 Wheat.
561,
(4) The appeal by the plaintiff did not involve an amount sufficient to
give this court jurisdiction.
THE

court stated the case as follows

JOH2NSON v. ST. LOUIS &c. RAILWAY.
Statement of the Case.

On the 23d of April, 1879, A. H. Johnson, of Helena, Arkansas, and the Iron Mountain and Helena Railroad Company,
an Arkansas corporation, entered into a written agreement,
whereby Johnson, in consideration of $29,000 to be paid to
him as thereinafter stipulated, agreed to complete the grading, tieing, culverting, clearing and grubbing on the company's railroad between its junction with the Arkansas Midland Railroad, eight miles west from Helena, and the town of
Marianna, in Lee County, Arkansas, a distance of about eighteen miles, to furnish certain cross-ties and square timber, to lay
the iron rails, and to place the road between those points in
good running order, the rails, fastenings, spikes, and switches
to be furnished by the railroad company, and the road to be
completed on or before September 1, 1879, 81000 to be paid
as each mile of the road was completed and ready for the running of locomotives and cars thereon, and the balance when
the track should be laid and the superstructure completed to
Marianna, and ready for the running of locomotives and cars.
It was further agreed that all moneys which might be collected by a committee of citizens appointed on behalf of certain citizens of Helena, who had subscribed money to aid in
building the railroad, should be paid by said committee to
Johnson in discbargepro tanto of the contract, that, until the
829,000 should be fully paid, Johnson should have the possession of the road and the right to run, use and control the
samebut such right of possession should cease and determine,
and Johnson should deliver up possession of the road to the
company, as soon as the $29,000 should be fully paid to him,
that the company might at any time terminate the contract
by paying to Johnson the value of the work then done by
him, and that, in estimating the value of the work, the whole
value, to the town of Marianna, should be fixed at $29,000;
and the proportion then performed by Johnson was to be paid
for at the rate of $29;000 for the whole. There was a provision for arbitration in case the parties should not agree as
to the value of the work, and the company agreed to furnish
to Johnson the iron rails, fastenings and spikes, from time to
time, as rapidly as he might be ready to lay the same.

and Southern Railway Company, an Arkansas corporation,

JOHNSON v. ST. LOUIS &c. RAILWAY.
Statement of the Case.

The suit referred to in that agreement was the suit for
forcible entry and detainer brought by Johnson. Before any
judgment was entered on the mandate of this court, and on
August 24, 1887, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern
Company tendered to Johnson $33,825, being the $25,000
mentioned in the agreement of October 6, 1881, and interest
on the amount at the rate of six per cent per annum from
that date to the date of the tender, which tender Johnson
refused.
On this state of facts, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and
Southern- Company filed a bill in equity against Johnson, as a
citizen of Ohio, in the District Court of the United States for
the Eastern District of Arkansas, setting forth the contract of
April 23, 1879, and the other facts hereinbefore stated, the
fact that the plaintiff had been made a party defendant to the
forcible entry and detainer suit, the affirmance of the judgment in that suit by this court, the agreement of October 6,
1881, the fact of the tender of the $33,825, and that Johnson
was preparing to take actual possession of the eighteen miles of
track, so as to cut off the plaintiff from all use of its line of
railway from Marianna to Helena. The bill prayed for an
injunction to restrain Johnson from any interference with
the eighteen miles of track, and for a perpetual injunction
against him from attempting to take possession of it or interfere with it.
On the filing of the bill, an order was made by the court,
that on the payment by the plaintiff into the German lational
Bank of Little Rock, Arkansas, the depository of the court, to
the credit of the court, of the $33,825, and the payment to the
clerk of all costs in the forcible entry and detainer suit, a temporary injunction should issue, enjoining Johnson from issuing
any process to put the plaintiff out of the possession of the
eighteen miles of track, or disturbing its possession thereof,
until the further order of the court in the premises, and that
Johnson might receive said sum from the depository at his
pleasure, without prejudice to any of his rights, and particularly his right to receive any further sum that -might be due
him, and for which he- had a lien on the eighteen miles of

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Argument for Johnson.

track, or a right to the possession of the same as security
therefor.
Johnson appeared in the suit and put in an answer to the
bill, setting up that the agreement of October 6, 1881, was not
in the nature of an account stated, but was, and was intended to
be, conditional and temporary, and that the condition had not
been fulfilled. To this answer there was a replication, and
proofs were taken.
On final hearing, the court made a decree that, on the plaintiff paying into the registry of the court the costs of the suit,
and $1000 for the amount expended by Johnson in necessary
preparations to take possession of the eighteen miles of track
and operate the same as required by law, Johnson should be
perpetually enjoined from executing the judgment at law in
his favor for the possession of the eighteen miles, and that, if
the plaintiff should fail to pay those sums into the registry of
the court, for the use of Johnson, within ninety days from the
date of the decree, the temporary injunction should be dissolved,
and Johnson might sue out proper process and execute the
judgment at law in his favor for the possession of the eighteen
*milesof road. Both parties took appeals to this court.
Mr John J Hornor and Xr3 A. H. Garland for Johnson.
I. The appellant in an action of forcible entry and detainer
instituted by him against the Iron Mountain and Helena Railroad, (to which appellee on its own motion had been made a
party defendant in the District Court of the United States for
the Eastern District of Arkansas, at Helena, and had taken
upon itself the defence of said suit,) was adjudged entitled to
the possession of said railroad, and a writ of restitution was
ordered to be issued to place him in possession thereof, and the
right was given to him to use, operate and control it, until
paid in full the sum due him under the contract. The bill
contains no allegation that anything has arisen since the
institution of said suit or rendition of said judgment which
rendered it inequitable that said judgment should not be
enforced.

JOHNSON v. ST. LOUIS &c. RAILWAY.
Argument for Johnson.

Equity will interpose to restrain the execution of a judgment
upon the suggestion of fraud, accident, mistake or surprise in
procuring it. In the case at bar there is not only no suggestion of fraud, accident, mistake or surprise, but, on the contrary, the sole issue in the action at law was the right of appellant under his contract to keep possession of the road, and all
the defences which legal acumen could bring forward to defeat
this right were invoked. The bill suggests nothing which had
arisen since the judgment in the action at law by which the
appellant had forfeited, either at law or in equity, the right of
possession given him by the contract, and confirmed by the
judgment. Even if the application had been made to restrain
the prosecution of the action of forcible entry and detainer,
no injunction would have been granted unless it appeared that
certain manifest irreparable injury would have followed the
withholding the relief. Crawford v Paine, 19 Iowa, 172,
Lamb v Drew, 20 Iowa, 15, Hamilton v Hen dnx, 1 Bibb,
67, 70; .MoCerure v Stewart, 1 T. B. Mon. 189.
This principle of law is peculiarly applicable to the case at
bar because appellee had utterly failed and refused to obtain
any adjustment of the amount due during all the period when
the right of possession was being litigated by it. As soon as
it is adjudged a trespasser it demands a settlement upon its
own terms, and, failing to obtain it, cries out that it, as well as
the public, will suffer irreparable injury if a court of equity
does not maintain it in its wrong doing, and actually not only
tendering a less amount than the terms of the contract agreed
should be paid, but a less amount than was actually due on
its own interpretation of the contract.
A court of conscience will not place a wrong-doer in a better
position than he has placed himself. It will leave him exactly
where it finds him. Oreath v Sims, 5 How 191, 205, Sample
v Barnes, 14 How 70.
A court of equity will not protect a party in the enjoyment
of that which he has obtained by a violation of law and
thereby enable him to benefit by his own wrong. Collett v
Jones, 7 B. Mon. 586, Howardv Current, 9 B. Mon. 493.
II. The relation between the parties was contractual and

the bill seek8 through a court of equity to relieve appellee
from the effects of the contract merely because the enforcement will now prove a hardship.
Mere hardship or inconvenience will not authorize a court of
equity to set aside the terms of a written contract. .ttng v
United States Bank, 11 Wheat. 59, Stelthetmer v Eillip, 75
N. Y 282.
Nor will a court of equity relieve a party from an improvident or foolish contract, if entered into without fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the other contracting party
Mfoffat v IMinslow, 7 Paige, 124.
III. The appellee is a trespasser in possession, after full
defence made by it to the action at law for such trespass.
It has been judicially determined in the case of 'on Mountan & H'elenam Railroad v Johnson., 119 U. S. 608, that not
only a railroad, but this identical railroad, comes within the provisions of the statute of the State of Arkansas on the subject
of forcible entry and detainer. It is alleged in the bill that
Johnson is only entitled to the possession as security for his
debt. If this be true, then under the laws of Arkansas all that
the appellees were required to do before suing out the writ
of unlawful detainer and replevying this railroad was to tender to Johnson in possession the amount due under the contract as construed by them. Under the statute the remedy
for the appellees to recover possession after any unlawful holding over by Johnson, was as summary as this court adjudged
it to be in favor of appellant when he was forcibly ejected
from it. The remedy at law was full, complete and adequate
and was the remedy provided by 'law when the contract was
entered into in 1879. And as such must have been in contemplation of the parties who executed such contract. Pr-Itchard
v Norton, 106 U. S. 124.
IV Neither the bill, the order of the judge granting the
injunction nor the decree perpetuating it, settled in any manner the rights of the parties under the contract of April 23,
1879. A sum of money is simply substituted as appellant's
security, instead of possession of the road, as provided in the
contract.

JUSTICE

BLATCH'O,

after stating the case, delivered

the opinion of the court.
It is contended by Johnson that the court below had no

jurisdiction to grant the injunction prayed for in the bill, because he had been adjudged, in the suit for forcible entry and
detainer, to be entitled to the possession of the 18 miles of
the road, and a writ of restitution had been ordered to issue
to place him in possession thereof, that it is not alleged that
anything had arisen since the institution of the forcible entry
and detainer suit or the rendition of the judgment in it, which
made it inequitable that such judgment should be enforced,
that the relations between the parties were entirely contractual,
and Johnson was seeking nothing not provided for by the
contract of April 23, 1879; that the bill in this suit does not
allege that such contract was obtained by fraud, accident,
mistake or surprise; that the plaintiff in this suit is a trespasser in possession, after full defence made by it to the forcible entry and detainer suit, and, without restitution, seeks,
through the interposition of a court of equity, to retain the
fruits of its trespass and nullify- the judgment at law; and
that the bill in this.suit does not seek to settle the rights of
the parties under the contract of April 23, 1879, nor does the
decree thereon settle such rights, but the order of injunction
and the decree nullify such contract by substituting a sum of
money as security to Johnson, instead of possession of the
road, as provided therein.
But we are of opinion, as contended by the plaintiff, that,
on the evidence in the case, the agreement of October 6, 1881,
was a settlement of the amount due to Johnson, and was and
is binding upon him, The. tender by-the plaintiff- to Johnson
of the $33,825, followed as it was by the payment into the
German National Bank of that sum, oA August.26, 1887, to
the credit of the court, as appears by the, record, changed thc

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Opinion of the Court.

condition of affairs, and entitled the plaintiff to the relief by
injunction asked for, because it showed that the contract of
April 23, 1879, had been fully complied with by the plaintiff,
as the successor of the Iron Mountain and Helena Railroad
Company, and that Johnson had no further right to the
possession of .the road. The $25,000, with interest from
October 6, 1881, was substituted for the $29,000, and the contract of April 23, 1879, is to be read as if the sum of $25,000,
instead of $29,000, had been mentioned in it. Johnson was
to have possession of the road, and the right to run, use and
control it, only as security for the payment of the money
and was to deliver up possession of it to the Iron Mountain and
Helena Company, of which the plaintiff is the successor, as
soon as the money should be paid. It was paid, by the tender
and deposit of the $25,000, with interest, and the right of
Johnson further to retain possession of the road, or to interfere
with it, ceased.
This case is not like that of Ballance v Forsyth, 21 How
183. There this court had, in Ballance v _Forsyth, 13 How
18, affirmed a judgment in ejectment against Ballance. After
the mandate went down from this court, Ballance filed a bill
:n equity, setting forth the same titles that were involved in
the ejectment suit, and praying relief, on certain special grounds,
by enjoining the execution of the judgment. The bill was
4ismissed, and this court affirmed the decree, on the ground
that Ballance could not appeal from the judgments of the Circuit Court and of this court to a court of chancery, on the
relative merit of the legal titles involved in the controversy,
which they had adjudicated. But in the present case the
relief in equity does not involve a regxamination of the
merits of the original controversy, but is based on grounds
arising subsequently to, and independently of, such controversy
The question raised as to the jurisdiction of the court below
in this suit is disposed of by the ruling in Parker v Tho
Judges, 12 Wheat. 561, where, while a writ of error was pending in this court, a bill in equity was fied in the court below,
and an injunction issued to stay proceedings on the judgment.

JOHNSON v. ST. LOUIS &c. RAILWAY.
Opinion of the Court.

After the judgment had been affirmed here, an order was
issued by this court to show cause why that court should not
issue an execution on the judgment. It was contended that
an injunction could not be awarded while the record was
before this court on a writ of error. This point was thus disposed of, Chief Justice Marshall delivering the opinion of the
court "We do not think this a valid objection. The suit in
chancery does not draw into question the judgments and proceedings at law, or claim a right to revise them. It sets up
an equity independently of the judgment, which admits the
validity of that judgment, but suggests reasons why the party
who has obtained it ought not to avail himself of it. It pro-poses to try a question entirely new, which has not been and
could not be litigated at law It may be brought before the
commencement of a suit at law, pending such suit, or after its
decision by the highest law tribunal." See also -Marshcall v
Holmes, ante, 589, and cases there cited.
Although the agreement in regard to the $25,000 was made
October 6, 1881, and the judgment in the forcible entry and
detainer suit was not rendered until March 14, 1883, such
agreement could have constituted no defence to that suit. It
was the tender of the money which laid the foundation for
the injunction suit, and, although the money might have been
tendered at an earlier day, the delay in tendering it deprived
the company of no rights and conferred none on Johnson. As
was said by this court in the forcible entry and detainer suit,
(119 U. S. 608, 612,) the questions there raised by the company in regard to the original contract of April 23,-1879, and
to the right of Johnson to hold possession of the road, were
immaterial. Equally, the equitable right involved in the
present suit could not have been material in the former suit,
even if such right had then existed.
The written agreement of October 6, 1881, is full and complete, and its terms cannot be varied, qualified or contradicted
by showing, as is sought to be done, a contemporaneous verbal
understanding that the $25,000 mentioned in the agreement
was to be paid in cash in a limited time, or satisfactory securities delivered in a limited time, or the written contract

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.

was to be void. The agreement of October 6, 1881, is, on its
face, an absolute one, that the amount due to Johnson under
the prior contract of April 23, 1879, was the sum, of $25,00a
on October 6, 1881, and it cannot be reduced by parol evidence
to a mere offer that in a certain contingency Johnson would
accept the sun , specified in full for the sum provided in the
original contract.
As to the appeal by the plaintiff, which calls in question so,
much of the decree as imposes upon it the costs of the suit and
the payment of the $1000, that appeal must be dismissed,
because it does not involve an amount sufficient to give this
court jurisdiction of it.
In No. 60 the decree zs affirmed with costs against Johnson,
and in .Yo.71 the appeal isdismassedfor want of jursdictwn.
Mia. JUSTICE LAxAn dissenting.
I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal in No. 1
for want of jurisdiction, but I dissent from the judgment and
opinion of the court, just announced, affirming the decree of
the court below in No. 60. As I see the case, it is a bill in
which the complainant, (The St. Louis, IroA Mountain and.
Southern Railway Company,) asks the aid of a court of equity
to relieve it from the execution of a judgment of a court of
law, affirmed by this court, upon the ground that it would ,be
against conscience to execute that judgment in obedience to,
the inandate of this court. I do not say that a court of equity
cannot interfere in such a case. But, as has been remarked
by Lord Redesdale, "bills of this description have not of late
years been much countenanced." 2 Story Eq. Jur. § 888. In
general, such jurisdiction isexercised only in a case where the
equity of the applicant is free from doubt - such-equity, for
instance, as that the judgment was obtained by fraud, accident
or mistake, or. that the applicant had a good defence to the
action at law of which he could not avail hiiself in a court of
law, or was prevented from doing so by the act of the adverse
party, or by some accident unmixed with negligence or fault

JOHNSON v. ST. LOUIS &c. RAILWAY.
Dissenting Opinion. Lamar, J.

in himself, or that the right, upon which the relief he asks in
equity, arose after the judgment at law was obtained, and
independently of it, and which would not have constituted a
defence in the suit at law -larshall v. Holmes, ante, 589,
and cases there cited. I do ot think that the state of facts
which appears in this record presents such a case. It is more
like the case of Ilallance v Borsyth, 24 How 183. In that
case, Ballance brought an action of ejectment against Forsyth
and obtained a verdict and judgment for the recovery of the
land in dispute. The judgment was affirmed by this court.
13 How 18. After the mandate went down from this court,
Ballance filed a bill in equity, setting forth the same titles that
were involved in the buit at law, and praying relief on certain
special grounds. Mlr. Justice Campbell, who delivered the
opinion of the court, said "This is a bill filed by the plaintiff
to enjoin the execution of a judgment in. the Circuit Court,
upon which a writ of error had been taken to this court and
affirmed. The cause in this court was between the same
parties, and the decision of the court is reported in 13 How
18. The plaintiff sets forth the claims of the respective parties,
and insists that his is the superior right, and that he is entitled to have the property.- But it ts not allowable to him to
appealfrom the judgment of the Circut Court and Supreme
Court to a court of chancery upon the relative merit of the
Zegal titles snvolved sn the controversy they had adjudicated."
These few sentences aptly characterize the case under consideration. The two cases, in their essential features, are very
similar. In the one cited, the relative merits of the legal titles
to the property in dispute were involved. In this, the relative
claims of right to the possession of the property in dispute are
involved. There is one difference between them. The applicant for relief in this case comes into court an adjudged trespasser and wrong-.doer, asking for relief from the legal effects
of his own wilfully illegal act. In speaking of the complainant
as a trespasser and wrong-doer, I am sustained by the statement in the bill itself, to the effect that, whilst the action
of forcible entry and detainer was pending, the complainant
bought the property of which the appellant was dispossessed,

OCTOBER TERM, 1891.
Dissenting Opinion. Lamar, J.

took possession thereof and became a maintainer of the defendant in the suit, and was -itself made a party to said suit.
The special equities upon which Forsyth, in the case just
referred to, asked for relief, are not enumerated in the report
of the case. But in this case we find none of the equities
which courts 9f chancery have recognized as justifying an
interposition by injunction to restrain the execution of a judgment. It is not pretended that the judgment in the action at
law was obtained by fraud, mistake or accident. It is not
denied that that judgment was rendered after a fair, legal,
protracted and warmly contested trial. There is not an averment that the judgment is even erroneous in law or that it
worked an unjust hardship on the railroad company
The bill alleges no fact or circumstance which has occurred
since the rendition of the judgment by the District Court and
this court, which would make its execution against conscience.
The only equity it assumes to set up is the irreparable damage
and injury which it alleges would be caused to the railroad
company by reason of its being a common carrier and a
United States mail carrier over the railroad in question, whose
duties -it would be unable to perform if not allowed to retain
possession and use of said railroad. The answer to this claim
is, that the irreparable mischief was as imminent when the
action at law was pending as it is now Nor was there any
fact which being a good defence, either legal or equitable,
pending the action, of which it was prevented from availing
itself by any agency -of the opposite party or by any accident
unmixed with its own negligence or fault.
I do not think that the vWfiten agreemenc of October 6,1881,
between the appellant, Johnson, and Bailey, (the president of
the railroad company,) merits consideration as a ground of
equitable relief, in view of the peculiar circumstances which
attended its execution. That writing was entered into whilst
the possessory suit was pr ding and before the complainant
was made a party thereto. If it is a valid ground for equitable
intervention now, it was then, and the complainant could have
filed his bill on the equity side of the court, praying that the
action he suspended until the equities of the case could be
adjusted, and thus have prevented the judgment from being

obtained. Instead of pursuing such a course the complainant
waited about seven months after the judgment was affirmed
by this court, when, assuming that the written agreement, so
called, was the sole measure of the rights of Johnson under the
judgment, it tendered him the sum named in that agreement,
and upon his refusal to accept the same as a full satisfaction,
instituted this suit, asking the court to aid it in retaining its
illegal and ill-gotten possession of the property in the controversy The same remark applies to the tender by the company
to Johnson of $25,000. It was not such a fact, arising after
the judgment, and independent of it, as constitutes in itself
alone a right to invoke the aid of a court of equity, but it
was an act closely connected with that judgment, not independent of it, resorted to as a means of avoiding the execution
thereof by offering the $25,000 as a substitute for its satisfaction, in no aspect of it does that tender, relied on as the foundation of this suit, create the clear and unquestionable equity
which alone can justify a court of chancery in suspending the
execution of a judgment, for the express purpose of giving its
sanction and protection to a possession acquired by an unlawful forcible entry and detainer. The undisputed facts of the
case are, that the appellee purchased from the original transgressor, who had ousted Johnson of his rightful possession of
the railroad property, took possession and continued in the
wrongful occupancy and use of it, contested the action of
forcible entry and detainer brought by Johnson until judgment was rendered in his favor, awarding to him restitution of
the possession of the property, which, on a writ of error from
this court, was affirmed, and now when it asks for a decree
enjoining Johnson from taking the possession thus adjudged
to him, equity demands that before the preventive remedy of
injunction can be invoked, there must first be an actual restoration of the injured party to his original rights.
I think the decree of the court below should be reversed,
and the cause remanded with direction to dismiss the bill and
dissolve the injunction.
MR. JUSTIcE GRAY was not present at the argument and

took no part in the decision.
