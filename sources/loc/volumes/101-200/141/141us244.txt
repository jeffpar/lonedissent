OCTOBER TERAI, 1890.
Statement of the Case.

Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which we have just reversed.
It is apparent from an inspection of the record that the whole
loundation of that part of the judgment which is in favor of
the defendant is, to our judicial knowledge, without any
validity, force or effect, and ought never to have existed.
Why, then, should not we reverse the judgment which we
know of record* has become erroneous, and save the parties
the delay and expense of taking ulterior proceedings in the
court below to effect the same object?
Upon full consideration of the matter we have come to the
conclusion that we may dispose of the case here.
We,therefore, reverse the yudgment of the Circuit Court, and
order that the cause be remanded with directions to enter
yudgrment for the latnti n error against the defendant
in error for the whole amount sued for -n the action,
namely, ezght thousand dollars,with znterest and costs, and
take suck further proceedings as may be proper sn conformity with ths opmnion.

"There is no other allowance of an appeal or writ of error
in the cause of record, except that disclosed in the bond for
supersedeas and the orders thereon, as above stated and no
formal writ of error appears in the record.
"The plaintiff in said judgment, who is shown by the record
-to be the surviving partner of the firm of Reiley & Gude, on
the 9th of July, 1890, presented his petition to Hon. John
Bruce, who took and approved said supersedeas bond, praying
that he would revoke the supersedeas created by said bond
because it was not valid in law to prevent the issue of execution on the judgment which was not accurately described in
the supersedeas bond.
"Judge Bruce denied the petition, and thus sustained the
validity of the bond, and treated the case as if it had been
removed into the Supreme Court of the United States.
"The petition and the papers relating thereto were filed in
said Circuit Court and a certified transcript of the same is submitted with this motion to this Honorable Court.
"These papers, thus certified, are dehors the record in the
case adjudged by the court, but they are here presented to
show that the plaintiff, Gude, is withont remedy as to execution on his judgment until the Supreme Court has exercised
jurisdiction-in the main cause, or has declared that it has no
jurisdiction."
