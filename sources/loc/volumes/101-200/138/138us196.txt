GOBURN v. CEDAR VALLEY LAND AND CATTLE
COMPANY (Limited).
SAME v. SAME.
SAME v. SAME.
SAME v. SAME.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED
THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.

STATES FOR

Nos. 139, 140, 141, 142. Argued and submitted January 9, 1891.-Decided January 26,1891.
A -litigation existed between the appellants and the appellee, which was
embodied in two bills, two cross-bills, their respective answers, and the
other proceedings therein. A correspondence ensued which resulted in
a proposition for compromise and settlement on the one side, which was
accepted by the other. Subsequently it appeared that the appellee intended and considered the agreement of settlement to embrace a complete relinquishment and discharge of all claims of either party against
the other, while the appellants claimed that they were to retain their disputed claims against the appellee. The appellee thereupon iled a petition in each of the causes, disclosing to the court the correspondence and
agreement of settlement and praying for a decree that all matters in controversy "had been settled and compromised by the parties and are
decreed and adjudged to be finally settled, and ordering that all the cases
be dismissed." The court below, after hearing the parties, found that
there had been a full compromise and settlement by agreement of the
parties, and ordered each of the bills to be dismissed. A motion to vacate
these decrees, and grant a rehearing was overruled. Held,
(1) That the parties intended to make a full compromise and settlement
of all claims and demands on either side, and that the decree of
the court below was right, and should be affirmed;
(2) That no objection having been raised, until after decision rendered,
to the proceeding by petition instead of by supplemental or crossbill, the decree should not be vacated or disturbed on that
account; especially as the appellants'had appeared in answer and
opposition to the petitions, and had introduced affidavits to support
their contentions.

THESE cases, as stated in substance by counsel, may be
described as follows:

COBURN v. CEDAR VALLEY LAND CO.
Statement of the Case.

(1) On October 10, 1885, the Cedar Valley Land and
Cattle Company, Limited, an English corporation, filed its
bill against William N. Ewing and James M. Coburn in the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District
of Missouri, alleging that Stewart and others, having ascertained that the defendants were willing, in conjunction with
them, to subscribe to the capital stock of the corporation when
formed, agreed among themselves to become the promoters of
a corporation for the purpose of purchasing a ranch with the
cattle and horses thereon, then the property of one Munson,
and situated in the State of Texas; that the name of the corporation was to be the Cedar Valley Land and Cattle Company, Limited, and that plaintiff is the identical corporation
in contemplation; that the corporation was formed January
7, 1885, and in the preceding December, Stewart, Burnett,
Campbell and Fisher, styling themselves plaintiff's directors
and acting as plaintiff's promoters, believing that defendants
were willing to undertake and assume the trust in behalf of
the proposed corporation, directed and requested defendants
to buy the ranch, land and cattle from Munson for plaintiff at
the very lowest terms, and defendants accept6d the trust ;
that on December 31, 1884, defendants, in the name of Ewing,
in pursuance thereof, concluded negotiations with Munson for
the ranch, and purchased it for plaintiff, and Ewing entered
into a written contract with Munson, which is set out at length
in the bill; that this contract was made for and in behalf of
plaintiff, in contemplation of corporate existence, as was the
employment of Ewing by the promoters and the contract of
purchase, and with the intention that the contract should be
adopted by the corporation when formed and enure to its
benefit; that said contract was so adopted and the corporation
proceeded to carry the same out, and complied with all the
terms and conditions of the contract, including the payment of
the sums of money therein provided, being $100,000 remitted
December 31, 1884, $140,000, May 5, 1885, and $180,000 June
18, 1885, which moneys were entrusted to the defendants to
make such payments; and that Ewing, on the 31St of December, 1884, made a declaration of trust that the $100,000 to be

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Statement of the Case.

paid on that day was the property of the plaintiff. Plaintiff
further averred that in August, 1885, it learned that Coburn
and Ewing had secretly agreed with Munson for a commission
for selling said property, and had received about $40,000 from
him on that account, which was retained out of the moneys
remitted, and that defendants agreed to pay Munson for some
of his cattle about $18,000 more than he had at first been
willing to sell for; and further, that defendants, out of the
cash sent them by the company with which to p-4y Munson,
had retained the sum of'$60,000, and, in lieu thereof, had conveyed to him a lot and building in Kansas City, belonging to
them, worth not more than $45,000. The bill prayed for a
decree for such amount as defendants might be found to have
received, upon an acouftting, etc.
The defendants answered denying that they.were promoters
of said corpgration, and alleging that all- heir agreements and
arrangements as to the character in which they should act in
the purchase of said ranch property, were made with Burnett,
one of the persons named as- a promoter and director in the
bill, and that Burnett knew that the defendants would be
paid a commission by Munson, and that the defendants were
openly engaged in the business of selling such property for a
compensation; and that the services rendered by defendants
involved much labor and were reasonably worth a larger
amount than was received. The answer also alleged that
plaintiff acquired said ranch for $100,000 less than its actual
market value; and that the only connection which defendants
had with said corporation was that after it had been organized,
Ewing subscribed to its capital stock, pursuant to a contract
by which he was appointed its manager for the term of five'
years.
Exceptions were filed to the sufficiency of this answer, which
were referred to a special master for examination and report.
This report was made and the exceptions set for hearing. 'Phe
appeal in this case is No. 139.
(2) On December 8, 1885, Coburn and Ewing filed a crossbill against the Cattle company, by leave, which alleged that
they for a. number of years .had been partners in the business

COBURI

v. CEDAR VALLEY LAN!D CO.
Statement of the'Case.

of selling property as brokers and for a commission, and that
at all the times mentioned in the plaintiff's bill, they had the
ranch in their charge for the purpose of selling the same under
an agreement for a reasonable compensation to be paid them
by Munson; that Burnett, knowing this fact, made an agreement with them to procure a purchaser for said property if
they would share their commission with him; that afterwards
they were directed by Burnett to buy the property upon terms
and conditions and at specified prices known to him; that they
entered into the contract with Munson pursuant to directions
from Burnett, and expended a large amount of .time and
labor in the transaction, a reasonable compensation for which
was alleged to be $50,000;. and that some months afterwards,
the corporation, having been organized in the meantime,
entered into an agreement with Coburn and Ewing, that, if
they would subscribe $100,000 to its capital stock, it would
appoint Ewing its manager for the period of five years at a
stipulated salary, which proposition was accepted, the sum of
$50,000 paid on account of such subscription, and the appoint.ment accordingly made. The cross-bill further alleged that
said corporation had attempted to annul the contract so made
with Ewing, and, without offering to cancel said subscription
or to return any part of the money paid on account thereof,
or tendering or offering to pay the reasonable and expected
profit arising from said contract, had sought to sequester said
stock and had refused to permit its transfer on its books; and
that the market value of said stock was $125,000, and the
reasonable and expected profit arising out of said contract
was $20,000.
The cross-bill prayed for an answer to certain separate interrogatories directed to matters peculiarly within the knowl-*
edge of the corporation, and that upon its appearing to the
court that Coburn and Ewing were entitled to be paid a.reasonable compensation, and that it was the duty of the corporation to pay the same, the court might decree it to Coburn and
Ewing, and that the corporation might be required to pay
them the value of their stock, less any sum that might be
unpaid thereon, and to pay to Ewing the sum of $20,000 on

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Statement of the Case.

account of his contemplated profit out of the contract appointing him manager of the corporation, and also for general relief.
To this cross-bill the Cattle company filed a demurrer. The
appeal in this case is No.142.
(3) On October 6, 1885, Coburn and Ewing filed their bill
against the Cattle company and George D. Fisher in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, which alleged that,
in March, 1885, Ewing proposed to the defendant company,
on behalf and in the name of Coburn and Ewing, to subscribe
for two thousand shares of its capital stock, of the par value
of $50 each, upon the condition that Ewing should be appointed manager of the company for the period of five years;
that this proposition was accepted and Ewing appointed accordingly by the directors of the corporation, and thereupon
Coburn and Ewing subscribed for the two thousand shares and
paid $50,000 in full of all assessments or calls which had been
made on said stock, and certificates had been issued to them
accordingly; that Ewing entered upon the duty of manager
and had been continuously employed therein ever since; and
that on September '1, 1887, the corporation attempted to cancel and terminate the appointment of Ewing as such manager
by written communication, setting forth that "in consequence
of the facts which have come to the knowledge of the board
of directors connected with your purchase from Mr. Munson,"
they had decided to annul his appointment, and that Fisher
was authorized to take charge of the company's property, and
requested the delivery of the same to. him accordingly. The
bill also alleged that there were peculiar reasons of fitness, etc.,
for the employment of Ewing, and that Coburn and Ewing
would not have subscribed or taken any shares in the capital
stock but for the contract to appoint Ewing manager; that
Ewing had faithfully performed all his duties and had at no
time given the company any just cause for terminating his
appointment; and that the contract was of great value to
Ewing, and would yield him a sum aggregating $20,500 for
the unexpired portion thereof. And the bill further alleged
that Fisher was undertaking to prevent Ewing from performing his functions as manager, and to take out of his. ossession

Statement of the Case.

all property in his hands as such, without offering to pay or
pefund the value of the stock to Coburn and Ewing, or the
'reasonable damages accruing to Ewing by reason of the refusal of the company to further perform its contract with him,
and without releasing or indemnifying him for certain liabilities he had incurred, and for which he was personally liable,
on' account of the company, to all of which compensation,
reimbursement and indemnity, Coburn and Ewing alleged
themselves entitled before Ewing .could be discharged from
said appointment; and an injunction was prayed accordingly.
This causewas removed to the United States Circuit Court
for the Western District of Missouri, and the corporation
answered alleging that no such contract was made for the
appointment of Ewing, but that the subscription of Coburn
andi:Ewing to the capital stock was unconditional; and that
Ewihig was appointhd as manager, but as an entirely separate
and -distinct transaction. It was admitted that said appointment was cancelled and terminated by the notice mentioned
in the bill, and the grounds for such action were' set forth as
resting practically on the same facts alleged in the bill of the
company in N6. 139. The appeal in this case is No. 140.
(4) On November 23, 1885,--the 'Cattle company filed a
cross-bill setting forth the alleged employment of Coburn and
Ewing on behalf of the intended corporation'; the making of
the contract with Munson; that Coburn and :Ewing had received a commission. from funson secretly; the transactions
as to the property in Kansas City, and the alleged overpayment in the purchase of cattle; the cancellation of Ewving's
appointment by reason of the premises; and alleging that
Ewing had done acts in hostility to the interests of the corporation, ivhich would be imperilled if he were- alloVed to manage the same. An injunction was prayed res'training Ewing
from acting as such- manager and in an.ywise ifiterfering with
the property of said cornoratien.
Coburn and Ewing answered averrinc, substantially tle

injunctions came on for hearing in December, 1885, and the
Circuit Court made an order granting the temporary injunction prayed for in the -cross-bill of the Cattle company. The
appeal in this case is No. 141..
The record in No. 141 discloses that upon the cross-bill there
was filed an affidavit with exhibits, which showed that a suit
had been commenced by Coburn and Ewing against the Cattle company in a State court of Texas and an injunction
obtained, which, upon the removal of the cause to the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas,
was dissolved by Judge McCormick, upon the ground that
where it appeared that plaintiffs had been employed to purchase a ranch and cattle, and had secretly received from the
seller a commission, and where one of them had afterwards obtained employment from the company as manager of the ranch
and herd, without disclosing the facts, the company had good
cause for removing him from a position obtained under such
circumstances. The opinion is reported in 25 Fed. Rep. 791.
June 19, 1886, the'Cattle company filed in each of said
causes the following "petition for a decree :"
"iNow comes The Cedar Valley Land and Cattle Company,
Limited, a party to the above-mentioned suits, and petitions
the court to enter an order or decree in- each of said cases
showing that the matters in controversy therein have all been
settled and compromised by. the parties and are decreed and
adjudged to be finally settled, and ordering that all the said
cases be dismissed, the plaintiff in each to pay costs therein,
and that the sureties on the injunction bond given by this
petitioner be discharged.
"And in support of this application, the petitioner files
herewith true copies of the written correspondence between
the parties, embodying their agreement of compromise, and on
the hearing of this petition will produce the originals thereof;
also affidavit of George Dixon Fisher."
The correspondence was as set forth in the margin.'

The affidavits of :Messrs. Fisher, McCrary and Field were
also filed on behalf of appellees.
"1.

C. & E. to be paid back the money for their stock, say $50,000.

"C. & E. to pay back the sum of $40,000.
"The company to enter its appearance in a suit to be brought by C. &. E.
to determine the value of their services and commission in purchase of
property, leaving out all transactions between C. & E. and W. B. M.
"2. The company to allow C. & E. $25,000 as their commissions for the
purchase of the ranch, C. & E. to pay balance of $40,000, company to pay
back amount of stock, each party to pay costs made by themselves.
"3. Arbitrate by three persons, one selected by each, they to choose a
third, what their services shall be, and the company then to pay the amount
set, C. & E. to pay $40,000 & company to pay amount of stock.
"Either proposition to be finality as to all the matters embraced in the
bill filed by the Company vs. C. & E."
Response to the proposition of Waters and Karnes, Attorneys for Coburn
"Adams and Field and Geo. W. McCrary will recommend to their client,
the Cedar Valley Land and Cattle Company, a settlement with Coburn and
Ewing as follows:
"1. C. &. E. to be allowed for their stock what they have paid on it.
"'2. C. & E. to pay back to the company the sum of $40,000.
"3. Ewing to surrender management.
"4. This settlement to be a full and final adjustment of all the controversies between the parties and of all claims of either party against the
other.
"5. No delay of legal proceedings in consequence of these negotiations,
unless by an agreement the controversies are ended.
" This proposition involves the surrender of the company's claim for the
profit on the sale of the Delaware-street property, to which we think it
entitled, and which will, we suppose, amount to about the sum of $15,000, as
well as other claims set forth in its bill.
"And it involves also the allowance for the stock of C. & E. of about
$10,000 more than its present value.
"These are, therefore, the most favorablerterms we can recommend, and
under no circumstances can we advise the payment of commissions to C. &
B., or any waiver of the company's right to defend against any claim that
they may make on this account."

"In the matter of controversy between the Cedar Valley Land and Catti(

Statement of the Case.

Fisher stated that about the 29th of April, 1886, he called
upon Coburn and submitted to him the form of a bond to be
directed to terminate rather summarily the negotiations to that end undertaken a few weeks ago. I have now taken the liberty of addressing you
this note entirely upon my own responsibility, and I am induced to do so by
a statement made to me by Mr. Gage, a mutual friend of both parties, to
the effect that he understood Mr. Fisher that the terms proposed by you in
our former negotiation were still open for acceptance. If such be the case
I say frankly to you that in my judgment the terms then proposed contain
substantially the correct basis of settlement, and I would like again to move
in the direction of ending all this interminable litigation. I do not wish to
trespass on your valuable time, and hence I have not called to present these
views in person, but if this letter receives a favorable response I will see
my clients and at some time, when agreeable to you, will call at your office to
canvass the matter more in detail. If it is thought best by you not to negotiate further I would be glad that no mention be made of this letter."
From appellees' to appellants' counsel, December 28, 1885.
"Yours of this date received. Mr. Fisher is out of town and will not
return until the last of the week. I think, however, he is still disposed to
settle, ad if you can bring your clients to agree to the terms proposed by
us let me know, and as soon as he returns I -%ll see him and advise you.
"P. S. -I will not mention the matter to any one until I hear from you
further."
From appellants' to appellees' counsel, December 28, 1885.
"Upon the receipt of your communication of to-day I at once sought an
ifterview with my cientg. Maj. Ewing is out of the city, and I only saw
Mr. Coburn, who thinks Maj. Ewing will agree to any arrangement that he
may make. He has much to say of the company's injustice to them in seeking to appropriate without compensation the result of their labor and skill
in the purchase of this property. He contends that Munson was taken at a
time when for several reasons he was very anxious to sell, and that they
drove an unusually. good bargain with him. Of course, I have sought to
jimpress upon him that the case must be tried squafely upon the law. I
have brought myself to believe that there is not much probability of your
recovering on account of the house and the bulls, but as to the commission
of $40,000 I have frankly said that I believed the chances were against my
clients. This amount represents the whole sum your company has lost,
while it has received the benefit of valuable services at no expense whatever. Any settlement made must involve an entire withdrawal of the interests of Coburn and Ewing. They insist that their stock is worth a premium, while, on the other hand, Mr. Fisher claims that it has depreciated. I
am aware that you have the impression that Birnett was not connected with
this sale, but in this it is more than probable that you are in error, and

given by Coburn and Ewing in pursuance of the terms of the
compromise, to bind said firm not to buy up or otherwise
Coburn and Ewing have in their possession the proportional part realized
coming to Burnett, amounting to $16,800. All these phases of the case I
have gone over carefully with Mr. Coburn, and he has become willing to
settle in a way approximately as follows:
"(1.) That the stock of Coburn and Ewing be taken at $50,000.
"(2.) That Coburn and Ewing pay back to the company the $40,000
received from Munson.
" (3.) That the company, with American securities, indemnify C. & E.
against any claim of the representatives of Burnett as to the .$16,800.
" (4.) That all suits be dismissed, each party paying his own coats, all.
claims for damages or compensation be waived, and full receipts passed.
"(5.) That the salary of Ewing up to the time of his discharge be paid
,to him, amounting to about one month's pay, and that there be paid a few
small items of expenses, amounting in all to a very small sum. As I understand, this is substantially your proposition to us. In a conversation with
you I think you stated that you would favor the indemnity for the $16,800.
I believe there is a controversy between Mr. Ewing and Mir. Fisher as to
whether the company owes Ewing about a month's balance on salary. This,
however, of course, can be settled by the books. If' I have not made my
proposition clear I will be glad to state it more fully, and upon Mr. Fisher's
return I much hope a satisfactory adjustment can be made."
From appellees' to appellants'counsel, January5, 1886.
"We were advised by the counsel of the Cedar Valley Land and Cattle
Company in London that the company has no, right either to purchase or
provide for the cancllation of the stock now held by Coburn and Ewing.
In view of this advice Mr. Fisher does not feel At liberty to conclude the
settlement upon the basis of taking back the stock. If we could agree upon
any settlement which would leave the stock in the hand's of Coburn and
Ewing, or which would not require the company to take it, Mr. Fisher
would feel at liberty to act in the matter; but, as I hssume. that this cannot
be accomplished, I have advised Mr. Fisher, who leaves-for London in a few
days, to lay the whole matter before the board and give us instructions

"Your note of the 5th instant was duly received, stating 'that no further action could be taken in the matter of settling the dispute between the

of 'the bond had been changed by striking out the words "as
the delay that will be necessarily occasioned, as they hoped for a speedy
termination of the controversy. I have urged upon them that they allow
me to continue my efforts for an adjustment. This they have done, with
the understanding that I request you to ask Mr. Fisher to report by cable
at the earliest possible moment whether the proposition will be accepted.
This is a matter involving so large an amount and requiring the taking of
testimony at so many and such remote points that I assume that we are
agreed as to the importance of determining this negotiation one way or
another as soon as the same can be reasonably done.
Awaiting your further advice, I am, very truly."
From appellees' to appellants' counsel, January11, 1886.
"I have arranged with Mr. Fisher to cable me instructions from London
as to compromise of the controversy between Coburn and Ewing and the
C. V. L. & C. Company. I will advise you promptly when instructions are
received."
From appellants' to appellees' counsel, January26, 1886.
"Mess. Coburn & Ewing, have 2000 shares in the C. V. L. & C. Co., £5
each paid, amounting to about $48.800. They will settle the controversy

York, which explains itself. Mr. F. carries with him to London the several
propositions of settlement which have been under discussion. Will you

From Fisherto appellees' counsel, 29th January, 1886.
"As I wired you yesterday, I am unfortunately here till to-morrow at
2 p. m., in consequence of the steamer I intended sailing with yesterday
being disabled. I am sorry at this, as I am anxious to get to London to
consult with my co-directors. I have been thinking a good deal over the
best way to arrange a compromise with C. & E., but in every shape I take
it it is always saddled with the difficulty of dealing with their stock.
"No one, of course, would be fool enough to take their shares at par when
it is so generally known, and by none better than C. & E. themselves, that
the values of all cattle shares are not within 20 per cent of what they were,
and as the company itself can neither buy nor cancel it is most perplexing.
The following is a proposition that has occurred to me that C. & B. might
submit to the board: C. & E. agree to pay Co. the $5000 [$40,000] commission, "with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent per annum for the time
they have had it; C. & E. to retain their stock in company by the directors
getting for them an advance on it for $40,000, at the rate of interest of ten
per cent per annum, said advance to go to liquidate the debt to the company, C. & E., besides, paying the company's expense ifi connection with this
litigation.
",This arrangement would enable 0. & E. to hold their stock, which they
appear to value so highly, until such time as they could sell it at par, or
possibly, in two years, at a premium, and at the same time refund the $40,000. The company would in this case ndt commence proceedings for damages caused by turning back the cattle. If you think well of this project
you can see Karnes about it, and, if C. & E. are disposed to make the above
proposition, cable the word ' consent' on 8th February, the day I expect to
get to London. Frankly, I must say this is a more favorable settlement
than I would give them, as I am satisfied there is more in the real estate than
$15,000, but under the circumstances [it] might be accepted by the board.
"Of course, if there is no cablegram, I will understand they will not
make this proposition; in any case, write not later than Wednesday."
From appellants' to appellees' counsel, February2, 1886.
"I Am just in receipt of your letter of to-day, including a letter from
Mr. Fisher from N. Y., which I herewith return to you. You have heretofore seen fit to express your appreciation of what I had done and was doing
to get this controversy settled, and hence I need not restate my endeavors
in the matter. I am only sotry to see Mr. Fisher taking the position indicated by his letter. I am now convinced that Mr. Gage was correct in his
opinion that he, F., was unfavorable to any settlement. The terms proposed
in his letter I have not submitted nor will I submit to my clients. I have.
been satisfied from the beginning and am still satisfied, and have so stated
to Mess. C. & B., that they are liable in law for the return of the $ 0,000,

Coburn added the following words: "of all pending litigabut I don't believe they are liable any further. This they ought to repay.
On the other hand, this company had received the benefits of their labor

,of the case. On such a basis I have tried to have an adjustment made; but
if it is the determination bf Mr. Fisher to drive these men to the wall, then
there is no alternative left but to fight. I shall still hope, however, that
through the co~peration of yourself and Mr. Gage a fair and just settlement may be made, and that the damage to the interests of all concerned,

Statement of the Case.

agreed upon, and that it was intended that the same should
be a full and final settlement of all pending litigation between
the parties. The original paper referred to was attached.
Mr. McCrary testified that ,he had principal charge on behalf
of the company of the negotiations for compromise and settlement between the parties; that the company and. its counsel
throughont the negotiations insisted that any settlement made
should end the litigation, and the final proposition made by
the company February 11 and 12 was. not intended to .be any
departure from this condition, but on the contrary was submitted by this affiant as a proposition "to end the litigation,"
as appears by the letter transmitting the same; that neither
he nor the company ever for a moment intended to settle the
claims of the company against Coburn and Ewing, leaving
their claims against it to be further litigated, and if Coburn
and Ewing or their counsel had such an intention, it was
unknown to this afflant at the time the settlement was entered
into; that as soon as affiant heard an intimation that it might
be claimed that the settlement did not cover all the matters in
litigation, he wrote Coburn and Ewing the letter of February
27, 1886, which was written the same day the acceptance of
the proposition of compromise was received, and before any
steps were taken on behalf of the company by affiant to carry
the same out; that if affiant had then been notified that
Coburn and Ewing would insist that only one side of the controversy was settled, he would have tendered back the stock
certificate and declined to go on with the compromise; and
that, receiving soon after the paper filed with Mr. Fisher's
affidavit, in which Coburn described the proposition accepted
as one to settle "all pending litigation," affiant felt free to go
on and perfect the compromise, believing that if Coburn and
Ewing intended to attempt to reserve any right of action
against the company, it must be on some cause of action not
involved in the present litigation.
Mr. Field said that he was one of the attorneys of the Cattle
company, and on the 27th of February, 1886, presented to
Mr. Karnes a paper prepared after consultation with his associate counsel, which was destroyed or misplaced by affiant

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.

after Mr. Karnes declined to sign the same; that the principal
purpose in presenting such writing was to obtain the speedy
and formal discharge of the sureties on the injunction bond,
which purpose was explained to Karnes, though such paper
did contain stipulations as to dismissing the bills and crossbills at the costs of each party, respectively, all of which
counsel for the Cattle company understood was already included in the settlement; and that when such paper was presented to Mr. Karnes, he replied that Mr. Coburn had gone to
St' Louis, and that he would make no other agreement of settlement for Coburn and Ewing, but he assured affiant that the
'sureties on the injunction bond were not to be harmed or disturbed, and afflant dropped the matter and did not further
urge Mr. Karnes' signature to such writing.
On behalf of appellants the affidavits of Karnes and Coburn
were filed. Mr. Karnes stated that on the 27th of February,
1886, Mr. Field brought to'his office a statement to the effect
that the settlement of that day was to be in full of all claims
or demands between the parties, and he distinctly told Mr.
Field that such paper would not be signed, but that Coburn
and Ewing had settled their matters with the Cattle company
on the propositions of February 11 and 12 and the unconditional acceptance of these propositions by Coburn and Ewing,
and that this settlement would not be supplemented by. any
further agreement. He further said the letter of acceptance
had been prepared with the understanding that the terms of the
compromise would be accepted only just in the way they were
proposed. and to cover nothing more; and that every letter
and paper since, so far as his knowledge extended, had been
prepared with the understanding that the settlement of February 27 spoke for itself, and that nothing was to be added.
thereto or subtracted therefrom.
Coburn testified that when the prbpositions of February 11
and 12 were considered, 'all previous propositions had been
rejected ; that the compromnise proposed by the company would
not have been accepted had it not been supposed that it was
left open to Coburn and Ewing to assert any claim they had
lor services rendered in the purchase of the ranch. That in

the early correspondence this matter was referred to, but no
mention was made in the later correspondence of this compensation, and consequently to avoid any misunderstanding, the
terms proposed were unconditionally accepted; that the letter of M r. McCrary of February 27, 1886, was received and
submitted to affiant's counsel, who advised him that he had
distinctly informed Mr. Field that receipts in full were not to
be passed, and that there was therefore no necessity of making
any reply to Mr. McOrary's letter, for which reason he did not
answer the same; that in every step taken in closing up said
compromise, Coburn and Ewing had distinctly refused to sign
any receipts in full or acknowledge any settlement in full, and
that in the many recbipts passed, language indicating a settlement in full was in each case stricken out, and in lieu thereof
it was inserted that the receipt was given on the basis of the
letters of February 11 and 12 and the acceptance of February
27; that affiant had no recollection concerning the interlineation of the paper attached to Fisher's affidavit, but he knew
that there was no intention to convey the impression that
Coburn and Ewing intended to abandon their claim for services; and that every step taken in the purchase of the ranchwas in the utmost good faith and with strict regard to the
interests of the company, and Coburn and Ewing had paid to
it more than they ever received from Munson, and had received
no compensation whatever for their services in the purchase of
the ranch.
A hearing. having been had, the court rendered a decree in
each of the four cases, finding that there had been by the
agreement of the parties a full compromise and settlement
of all the matters in controversy in the case, and ordering, in
pursuance of the agreement, that each of the bills be dismissed
at plaintiffs' costs, to be taxed. The opinion of Judge Brewer
will be found in 29 Fed. Rep. 584.
On the same day, Coburn and Ewing moved the couit to set
aside and vacate the decree entered in each of said causes and
to grant them a rehearing, which motions were overruled, the
Circhit Court delivering an opinion reported in 29 Fed. Rep. 586.
Thereupon the cases were brought to this court by appeal.

CImF JusTicE

FULL R delivered the opinion of the

court.
We are entirely satisfied with the conclusion of the Circuit
Court, upon the evidence, that all the matters in controversy.
between the parties had been fully compromised and settled.
The litigation was being prosecuted upon two bills and two
cross-bills when the negotiations commenced, and involved
the claims of the company against Coburn and Ewing and the
claim of Coburn and Ewing for compensation for services
rendered in the purchase of the ranch. No reason appears
for the severance of claims so intimately connected, and the
reservation of the latter, while the former were settled. The
proposition from Coburn and Ewing's solicitors of November
12 embraced three distinct offers, and each offer included compensation for services in and about the purchase. The response to this proposition stated what- the counsel for the
Cattle company would recommend, the settlement so recommended "to be a full and final adjustment of all the controversies between the parties, and of all claims of either party
against the other," and that counsel would under no circum-stances "advise the payment of commissions to C[oburn] and
E[wing], or any waiver of the company's right to defend
against any claim that they may make on this account." It
is ingeniously argued by appellants' counsel that by this last
clause it was intended to so exclude from the settlement this
claim for compensation as to leave it outstanding to be litigated. :-But we think, on the contrary, that it was expressed
with sufficient clearness that the company would not be
advised to consider any offer of settlement except upon the
condition of the surrender eZ this claim, and that it was for
this reason that the negotiations were at that time terminated.
tfpon the 28th of December the negotiations were renewed

COBURN v. CEDAR VALLEY LAND CO.
Opinion of the Court.

upon the basis of the terms suggested by the Cattle company,
and the first.letter of appellants' solicitor of that date declares
that "the terms then proposed contain substantially the correct basis of settlement" and expresses the desire "again to
move in the direction of ending all this interminable litigation."
Appellees' counsel at once replied that "if you can bring your
clients to agree to the terms proposed by us let me know."
On the same day appellants' solicitor,, after going over the
matter carefully With Mr. Coburn, wrote, proposing: "(1.)
That the stock of Coburn and Ewing be taken at $50,000. (2.)
That Coburn and Ewing pay back to the company the $40,000
received from Munson. (3.) That the company, with American securities, indemnify Coburn and Ewing against any claim
of the representatives of Burnett as to the $16,800. (4.) That
all suits be dismissed, each party paying his own costs, all claims
for damages or compensation be waived, and full receipts passed.
(5.) That the salary of Ewing up to the time of his discharge
be paid to him, amounting to about one month's pay, and that
there be paid a few small items of expenses, amounting in
all to a very small sum. As I understand, this is substantially
your proposition to us."
To this appellees' counsel responded on January 5, 1886,
that London counsel had advised that the company could not
purchase or provide for the cancellation of the stock held by
Coburn and Ewing, and therefore that Fisher did not feel at
liberty to conclude the settlement upon the basis of taking
back the stock, though he would, if a settlement could be
agreed on which would leave the stock in the hands of Coburn
and Ewing, or which would not require' the company to take
it; and that he had'advised Fisher, who was leaving for London, to lay the whole matter before the board for instructions;,
which he hoped would enable "us to agree with you upon some
disposition of the stock and upon a final satisfactory adjustment of the matters between the parties." On the 26th of
January, appellants' solicitors wrote that Coburn and Ewing
would settle "the controversy with the company - (1) By
returning the $40,000 commission and the company taking
their stock at the actual price paid by them; or, (2) they will

Opinion of the Court.

turn over to the company 1600 shares and retain 400. (3) In
any event, C. & E. are to be protected against any claim by
Burnett's estate, either by a release or indemnity. (4) Mess.
C. & E. agree not to buy up or otherwise molest any of the
range privileges now enjoyed by the company. (5) This settlement in no way to affect the arrangements heretoforemade
concerning the W. & L. cattle but the same to be carried out
by both parties in good faith as agreed upon, but not to enter
into this arrangement in any other way whatever. In other
words, the W. & L. cattle are in no way taken into consideration in this settlement. (6) The balance of salary as compensation to be paid to Mr. Ewing." This -letter should be read
in connection with that of December 28, for its apparent object
was to accommodate the objection in relation to the stock, as
well as to except the W. & L. cattle. The language in respect
to the waiver of all claims for damages or compensation and
the passing of full receipts, was not repeated; but, taken in
connection with the original response of the Cattle company
and what had followed thereon, the Cattle company and its
counsel could not have- understood that there was an intentional reservati6n of the question of compensation. The controversy referred to, January 26, was the same controversy
referred to in the letter of January 8, of the same counsel, and
must be held. tp have covered the entire controversy in respect
to which, the parties were treating.
On the 2d of February appellees' counsel enclosed the letter
received from Mr. Fisher from New York, in answer to which
appellants' counsel, referring to the suggestions of Fisher in
relation to certain details of the settlement growing out of the
difficulty in dealing with Coburn and Ewing's stock in the
company, replied, saying, among other things, that Coburn
and .Ewing ought to repay the $40,000, but "on the other
hand this company has received the benefits of their labor
without any expense." Fisher carried with him to London, as
appellants were informed, "the several propositions of settlement which have been under discussion," and which bore upon
their face the concession that Coburn and Ewing no longer
claiied to be entitled to compensation.

COBURN 'v. CEDAR VALLEY LAND CO.
Opinion of the Court.

Upon the 24th of February the copy of the letter from the
secretary of the Cattle company was sent to appellants, stating
that the board of directors had had under consideration the
two alternative offers of the 26th of January for the settlement
of the claims made by the Cattle company, bnd that neither of
these propositions was acceptable. These alternative offers
related to the company's taking Coburn and Ewing's stock at
the actual amount paid by them, or taking 1600 shares and
retaining 400. The secretary then proceeded to state "the
only terms upon which the board can agree to compromise
the claim of the company," which terms required the payment
by Coburn and Ewing of £10,000, £4,000 in cash or in L. &
W. cattle, and the remainder by a sufficient number of shares
on the basis of par value; and the giving of security by Coburn
and Ewing not to interfere with the company's range privileges; and agreed to the indemifying of Coburn and Ewing
against any claim from Burnett's or his partner's executors.
And the letter says that in view of the facts "that the issue
has practically been decided against Mess. Coburn and Ewing
by the same judge before whom the case will ultimately be
tried," the amount of money received by them from Munson,
and the difficulty in placing any of the shares, etc., the board
is of opinion that the offer is favorable to Coburn and Ewing,
but "is induced to offer these easier terms with -the object of
settling the matter before the general meeting of the 4th of
Marsh." This would repay the company $50,000 instead of
$40,000 but only $20,000 would be paid in cash or cattle, and
the remainder in shares.
The contention seems to be that, as the terms of compromise
mentioned in the secretary's letter addressed to the Cattle
company's attorney, did not specifically allude to the claim
for compensation, both parties had made and received propositions in which that claim was left open to litigation, and
therefore, appellants could accept the proposition contained
in the secretary's letter, and at the same time reserve the objectionable claim. But we do not agree with that view, as
already indicated, and are of opinion that Coburn and Ewing
must have known that the intention of the company was to
I

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

settle the entire matters of difference between them, and that
in no event would the company entertain any claim for compensation on their part. This must be so, since the whole
theory of the negotiation, renewed December 28, conceded the
terms of the company's solicitors in response to the proposition
of November 12, as the correct basis of settlement, and those
terms embraced the rejection of the item of commissions,
which was so well understood that appellants' letter of December 28 expressly said that all claims for damages or compensation were to be waived aud full receipts passed. What
the board was considering, as appellants must be held to have
known, was what appellants should pay and how they should
pay it, and it was only in regard to the disposition of their
stock that any difficulty arose in substantially arriving at a
final conclusion before Fisher went to London.
It was claimed by the company that the stock was not worth
its par value on account of certain action on Ewing's part,
which turned out to be ill-advised, and the directors considered
that although they asked Coburn and Ewing to pay $50,000
instead of $40,000 as offered, yet as the larger part of this was
to be taken in their stock at par, it was a liberal offer on the
company's part, in view of all the other facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction. And to this Mr. McCrary
alludes in his-letter of Febtuary 24, when he says: "The sum
demanded is nominally larger than that offered by you; but,
as it is proposed to receive payment in cattle and the stock of
the company now held by 0. and E. at par, I am in hopes
your clients will consider it better to accept than to continue
the litigation."
The secretary assumed, as we think he had a right to do,
that the: claim for compensation on the part of Coburn and
Ewing had been dismissed as inadmissible, and that his letter
to the counsel of the company need only name the terms upon
which the company's claim was to be compromised. The
attempt, by the letter of February 27, 1886, reciting the secretary's letters, to so limit the compromise as to reserve the right
to litigate the question of compensation, is not commendable.
Appellants could not in good faith restrict their settlement in

COBURN v. CEDAR VALLEY LAND CO.
Opinion of the Court.

this way, nor attribute the courtesy with which Mr. McCrary
had acted as extending to a concession which he had refused
to make at the very threshold. And when he notified Coburn
and Ewing, on the 27th of February, that "it is understood that

the settlement embraces all the matters involved in the pending litigation in the several suits between the parties," it was
their duty, if that were not so, to have so advised him at once.
What passed between Mr. Karnes and Mr. Field is in dispute, but it is clear enough that it could not control so important a difference, if it really existed. The letter of Mr. McCrary
informed Coburn and Ewing that he should wire the company
of its acceptance of the proposition, and his affidavit shows that
this letter was written before he had taken any steps to carry
out the compromise on behalf of the company. The subsequent letters in March of Mr. McCrary and of the company
demonstrated their understanding that the entire controversy
was settled, which indeed was the only motive of any negotiations at all.
The grounds upon which the Cattle company resisted the
claim for compensation are too obvious to require comment,
and were the same which justified the removal of their agent
from his agency. We do not doubt that the compromise covered all the matters in controversy; that this was understood
by the parties with whom they were dealing; and that the
latterjwere bound, as the court held, in the premises.
But, although the decision of the court was correct upon
the merits, it is objected that the decrees in question were improperly rendered, for want of jurisdiction to proceed upon
the petitions. 'Undoubtedly the ordinary rule would have r4qui ied the matter of 'the settlement to be presented by a supplemental bill or cross-bill or a bill in that nature; and thesq\
decrees were rendered upon petition only. But this objectionwas not raised until after a decision rendered. Appellants
appeared in answer to the petitions, and introduced affidavits
to support their views of the meaning to be attached to the
correspondence, and they insisted that their claim for compensation was not embraced in the .compromise, and, therefore ,
that the dismissal of the bills should be without prejudice.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

The case of Zeley v. Hobby, 16 Pet. 269, 277, is decisive
against this objection. There a release was filed in a chancery
suit by the defendant, who moved to dismiss the bill, which
motion was opposed upon the ground that the release was
obtained by duress. The parties went on to take testimony as
to the circumstances under which the release was given, and
it was held by the court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice
Taney: "Some objections have been made as to the manner in
which the release was introduced into the proceedings. It
was filed in the cause, and a motion thereupon made to dismiss
the bill; and it is said that, being executed while the suit was
pending, and after the answers were in and the accounts
before the master, it should have been brought before the
court by a cross-bill or supplemental answer, and could not in
that stage of the proceedings be noticed by the court in any
other way. It is a sufficient answer to this objection to say
that it was admitted in evidence without exception, and both
parties treated it as properly in the cause; and the complainant proceeded to take testimony to show that it was obtained
from him by duress, and the defendants to show that it was
freely and voluntarily given. It had the same effect that it
would have had upon a cross-bill or supplemental answer, and
the complainant had the same opportunity of impeaching it.
And there is no propriety in requiring technical and formal
proceedings, when they tend to embarrass and delay the administration of justice; unless they are required by some fixed
principles of equity law, or practice, which the court would
not be at liberty to disregard." In Gilbert-v. Endean, 9 Ch.
D. 259, 267, gir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, uses this
language: "I think a Court of Appeal cannot refuse to decide
on the merits where the parties in the court below argued the
case on'the merits without objecting to the evidence. They
must be taken to have assented to having their rights decided
on the motion according to the usual rules governing interlocutory motions. If they wished them to be decided otherwise, they should have objected to the reception of the evidence.
I think it is impossible for the appellant to succeed upon that
ground, not having taken that course in the court below."

MILLER v. CLARK.

1223

Counsel for Parties.

These cases are cited by appellees together with Pryer v. Gribble, L. R. 10 Oh. 534; Tebkntt v. Potter,4 Hare, 164; Askew v.
Xilllngton, 9 Hare, 65. For&yth v. ]ifanston, 5 Madd. 78, Wood
v. Rows, 2 Bligh, 595, 617, Rowe v. Wood, 1 Jac. & Walk. 315,
337, and Tebbutt v. Potter, 4 Hare, 164, were referred to in
A8kew v. 3lillington; and Vice Chancellor Turnef held, where
the agreement of compromise went beyond the ordinary range
of the court in the existing suit, and the right to enforce the
agreement in that suit was disputed, that the proper course for
proceedings to enforce it was by bill for specific performance,
and not by motion or petition in the original suit to stay the
proceedings, and he thought this must necessarily be so where
the agreement itself was disputed. But, under the circumstances, we have already held that the petitioners' case did
not fail upon the merits, and as all parts of the agreement fell
within the range of the suits, and appellants did not dispute
the form of proceeding, we are of opinion that the decrees
cannot bo reversed upon this ground. They are therefore
Affirmed.
