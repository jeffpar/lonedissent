See also Lawrence v. Berney, 2 Rep. in Ch. *127; Adams Eq.
*416; 2 Dan. Ch. Pr. (4th ed.) 1586. This rule was much
considered and applied in TVadhams v. Gay, 73 Illinois, 415,
and approved by this court in Gay v. Parpart,106 U. S. 679.
The prior decree was the consequence of the consent and not
of the judgment of the court, and this being so, the court had
the right to decline to treat it as 'es ajudicata; WVadhams

As, therefore, if the old company had defended the suit
aogainst it, it would have prevailed, the decree of the Circuit
Court, being correct upon the merits, is also correct in that
the court refused to be constrained by the previous erroneous
consent decree, to decree contrary to the right of the cause.

SOHELL'S EXECUTORS v. FAUCHE.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 690.

Argued January 28, 1891.-Decided March 2,1891.

It appearing that at the date of the transactions in controversy, more than
,thirty years.ago, it was the custom for importers to pass in protests with
the entries, the court may presume that the usual course was pursued in
respect of a protest produced under subpoena at the trial from the proper
repository, where it had been lying for a long time, and that it was
made and served at its date, and before the payment of duties.
Two papers attached together by a wafer, and signed on the bottom of the
lower one, which when read together make a protest against two exactions
of duties, are to be treated as a unit.

SCHELL'S EXECUTORS v. FAUCHA.
Statement of the Case.
A protest against the exaction of duties is sufficient if it indicates to an
intelligent man the ground of the importer's objection to the duty
levied upon the articles, and it should not be discarded because of the
brevity with which the objection is stated.
When such a protest is in proper form and attached to the invoice, the
omission of date is immaterial.
The failure of a collector of customs to conform to a treasury regulation
requiring him to record protests ought not to prejudice the rights of the
importer.
A protest, otherwise valid and corree in form, against an exaction of
excessive duties upon an importation of' goods, which concludes "you
are hereby notified that we desire and intend this protest to apply to all
future similar importations made by us," having been long and consistently held by the court below to be a sufficient and valid protest against
prospective importations, so that that doctrine has become the settled
law of that court, and the general practice prevailing in the port of New
York, this court accepts it as the settled law of this court.
In all cases of ambiguity the contemporaneous construction not only of the
courts but of the departments, and even bf the .officials whose duty It
is to carry the law into effect, Is controlling.

Tis was a consolidation of six actions originally begun
between September 1, 1857, and March 1, 1860, in the state
courts of New York, and removed to the Circuit Court of the
United States. The actions were brought against the col
lector of customs for the port of f.New York to recover back
duties alleged to have been illegally exacted upon certain
importations of mousselines de laine made by'the copartnership
of which the defendants in error are the survivors. The consolidated suit was tried in October, 1887, and a verdict found
for the plaintiffs under the direction of the court for $50,563.44. Judgment having been entered against the executor'
of Augustus Schell, deceased, late collector of the port, a writ
of error was sued out from this court. The real question at
issue was whether mousselines de laine were under the act of
March 3, 1857, (11 Stat. 192,) subject to a duty of 19 or 24 per
cent. That question, however, was excluded from this case
under a stipulation "by and between the respective parties to
this action that mousselines de laine, composed of worsted, oi
worsted'with a-satin stripe, were, under the tariff acts of 1857,
subject to a duty of 19 per cent as claimed by the plaintiffs."'
As the duty exacted and paid was 24: per cent, judgment was

rendered for the difference, and the only questions argued by
counsel in this court arose upon the admissibility of testimony,
and the form, sufficiency and service of protests accompanying
the several entries of merchandise, which are set forth and
considered in the opinion of the court.

BRowN delivered the opinion of the court.

Apparently in consequence of the decision of this court in
Ca?'y v. Curtis, 3 How. 236, to the effect that under the
act of March 3, 1839, an action for money had and received
would not lie against a collector of customs for duties paid
under protest, Congress on February 26, 1845, enacted (5 Stat.
727) that nothing contained in the act of 1839 should be construed to take away or impair the right of any person who
may have paid duties under protest, to maintain an action at
law against a collector to ascertain the legality of such payment; "nor shall any action be maintained against any collector, to recover the amount of duties so paid under protest,
unless the said protest was made in writing, and signed by the
claimant, at or before the payment of said duties, setting forth
distinctly and specifically the grounds of objection to the payment thereof." The questions presented by the record in this
case turn upon the proper construction of this proviso, and
upon the proper practice to be pursued in making and serving
such protest.
1. Defendants objected to the receipt of Exhibit 5 and
twenty-six other exhibits standing in like position, with the
protests attached thereto. These exlhibits were all entries of
merchandise imported by plaintiffs in various ships, to which
were appended -the usual consignee's oath, and a specific protest duly signed by plaintiff's firm was also attached to each
one by a wafer. Objection was made to the admission of such
documentE.upon the ground that it did not appear that such

SCHELL'S EXECUTORS v. FAUCiH.
Opinion of the Court.

protests had been served upon the colleotor as required by the
act of 1845; and second, that if so served, it did not appear
that they had been served at or before the payment of the
duty sought to be recovered, as required by the same act.
The act of 1845 requires, first, that the protest shall be in
writing; second, that it shall be signed by the claimant; third,
that it shall be made at or before the payment of the duties;
and fourth, that it shall set forth distinctly and specificalfy
the grounds of objection to the payment of such duties. But
so far as respects the manner, or the person. upon whom protest shall be served, the statute is silent, and we can only infer
that from the nature of the proceedings it must be served uponr
the collector or his subordinate officer, or the person whci receives the entry or the payment of the duties. In this silence
of the statute, and in the absence of any treasury regulation
upon the subject, it would probably be cor*petent for the coll
lector to receive such protest personally, or delegate his authority to one of his deputies. It is not at all singular that after
the lapse of more than thirty years, it should be impossible to
prove upon whom the service was made; but we are informed
by the testimony of a custom of passing protests in with the
entry, which seems to have prevailed for some time prior to
the date of these transactions, and to have continued until the
treasury regulations of 1857 were adopted. Now, as these
protests were produced under subpoena at:the trial from the
proper repository where they appeared to have been lying for
a long time, it is not unreasonable to infer that the usual
course was pursued and the protests served according to the
custom of the office. With regard to the conduct of a public
office the presumption is that everything is done properly and
according to the ordinary course of business, or, as expressed
in the maxim, ornniaprixsuruntur"riteesse acta. 1 Greenleaf

Ev. sec. 38. The same presumption would justify us in inferring that the protest was made and served at its date, which,
in the case of Exhibit 5, was January 30, 1858, and before the
payment of duties, which appears upon the face of the entries
to have been made February 1, or two days after the protest
was signed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

2. Objection was also made to Exhibits 6, 11 and 13, upon
the grounds we have already held to be insufficient, and upon
the further ground that the protest consisted of two forms of
protest, one printed on white, like exhibit No. 5, but unsigned,
and the other on blue paper, the latter being pasted to the
former and signed by the plaintiffs' firm. The two papers
thus pasted together and signed, as aforesaid, were attached
to the entry by a wafer and, read together, made a protest
against two exactions, viz.: first, an excessive duty upon the
mousselines de laine; and second, the exaction of a duty upon
two and one-half or :three per cent commissions, when, as
claimed, such goods Were liable only to duty upon 'vo per
cent commission. This consolidated protest was dated "New
York, Feb. 10th," and addressed, immediately following the
date, to "Augustus Schell, Esq., Collector of Customs," and
signed at the bottom by Lachaise, Fauch6 & Co., the importers. Had it not been for the repetition of the word "Sir" at
the beginning of each section of the protest, and the further
fact that the protest was on two pieces of paper, there would
be nothing to indicate that the plaintiffs did not intend in one
communication to protest against the two exactions, viz.: the
excessive duty on the mousselines de laine, and the duty on
the commissions. While the protest is signed only at the end
of the second piece of paper, no one would be misled into supposing that the signature, and the final clause applying the
protest to all future similar imports, were not intended to
apply as well to the protest against the duty assessed upon
the mousselines te laine, as upon the commissions. And it
is evident from the protest books of the custom-house in
New York, that the entire paper was understood by the
official who recorded it, as a single protest against two
illegal exactions. Authorities are plentiful to the effect that
papers attached together even by a pin are to be treated as
a unit constituting one entire contract or memorandum.
Thus in Tallman v. Franklin,14 N. Y. 584, it was held that,
where an auctioneerpinned a letter to him from the owner of
certain real estate to be sold, which stated the terms of sale,
on a page bf his gales' book, and then made the residue of the

SCHELL'S EXECUTORS v. FAUCHE.
Opinion of the Court.

entries requisite to constitute a memorandum of the contract;
of sale on the same page of the book, and subscribed his name
to it, the letter was to be takdn as a part of the memoranduiu
subscribed by the auctioneer, and was sufficient to take- it out
of the Statute of Frauds. To the same effect are RHutcheon v.
Johnson, 33 Barb. 392, 395, where certain" papers which had
been pasted together were construed as a single memorandun;
Cinder v. Farnum, 10 Penn. St. 98, where the sheets of i will
were fastened together by a string;: and .artin v. Hamlin, 4
Strobhart Law, 188. If, however, the papers are not connected
together in fact, they are not considered as connected in law,
unless, at least, the paper signed refers in some way to the
other, which may then be construed as forming a part of it.
Hinde v. lVhitehouse, 7 East, 558; Kenworthy v. Scho&elZ,
B. & 0. 945. The proper test is, whether a person reading
these papers would be deceived or misled 7as to the actual intention of the writer. We think there can be but one answer
to this, and we hold the objection was not well taken.
3. The objections to the admission of Exhibits 1 and 2 are
also untenable. These protests were in the following form.
"New York, July 25, (27,) 1857. Augustus Schell, Esq.,
Collector of the Port of New York. Sir: We hereby protest
against the payment of a duty of 24 per cent, charged by
you on worsted stuff goods, claiming that under existing
laws said goods are only liable to a duty of 19 per cent as a
manufacture of worsted. We pay the amount exacted to
obtain possession of the goods, claiming to have the difference
refunded. Lachaise, Fauch6 & Co." Objection was made to
these protests upon the ground that neither of them distinctly
and specifically set forth the ground or grounds of objection
to the payment of the duties exacted on any of the importations mentioned therein, as required by the act 'of 1845. In
Greely's Administrator v. Burgess, 18 Howard.413, 416, the
protest was objected to upon the ground that it 'stated only
"that the goods were not fairly and faith'fully examined by
the appraisers," and the proof offered was, that the appraisers
did not examine any of the original packages, and only saw
samples which had' been taken several weeks before, and

which would not afford a true criterion by which to judge
of the importation. Mr. Justice Campbell observed "This
statute was designed for practical use by men engaged in

active commercial pursuiits, and was intended to superinduce
a prompt and amicable settlement of differences between the
government and the importer. The officers of the government on the one part, and the importer or his agent on the
other, are brought into communication and intercourse by the
act of entry of the import, and opportunities for explanation
easily occur for every difference that may arise. We are not,
therefore, disposed to exact any nice precision, nor to apply
any strict rule of const-uction upon the notices required under
this statute. It is sufficient if the importer indicates distinctly
and definitely the source of his complaint, and his design to
make it the foundation for a claim against the government."
The protest was held to be sufficient. So, in Arthur v. -Yorgaze, 112 U. S. 495, it was held that a protest against paying a
certain duty upon a carriage, which stated that the carriage was
"personal effects," and had been used over a year, and that,
under the Revised Statutes, "personal effects in actual use"
are free from duty, was sufficient, upon which the amount
paid for duty could be recovered back on the ground that the
carriage was free from duty as "household effects" under
the same statute. It was said by Mr. Justice Blatchford:
" The protest is not required to 'be made with technical precision, but is sufficient if it shows fairly that the objection
afterwards made at the trial was in the mind of the party
and was brought' to the knowledge of the collector, so as to
secure to the government the practical advantage which the
statute was designed to secure." In the case-under consideration, the importer claimed in substance in his protest, that
the duty of 24: per cent was excessive, and that the goods
were liable only to a duty of 19 per cent "as a manufacture
of worsted." ilis-insistence upon classifying them as a manufacture of worgted indicated clearly that the objection made
was substantially to their classification as "de laines." We
think- the collector upon reading this protest could have no
doubt:in ht mind that the intention of the importer was to

SCIIELL'S EXECUTORS v. FAUCHA.
Opinion of the Court.

object to the failure to classify the goods as a manufacture of
worsted. Some allowance must be made for the magnitude
of business done at a large port, and the hurry and confusion
necessarily incident to its transaction, as well as for the proneness of commercial men to look at the substance of things,
rather than at the form in which their ideas are expressed.
A protest which indicates to an intelligent man the ground of
the importer's objection to the duty levied upon the articles
should not be discarded because of the brevity with which the
objection is stated.
4. Exhibits 14 and 41 contain protests which are without
date, and objection was made to them upon that ground.
But as it appeared that these protests were in proper form,
the same form as No. 5, and were attached to the invoice of
merchandise mentioned therein, and duly signed by the plaintiff's firm, we regard the omission of the date as quite immaterial.
5. Objection was also made to the admission of twenty-two
protests upon the ground that there was no evidence that
these had been copied in the record kept for that purpose.
Treasury Regulation No. 387 provided that "whenever duties
are paid under protest, collectors of customs will have the
protest carefully and accurately copied at length in a record
to be kept for that purpose, properly compared, verified and
certified as a correct copy by the officer or officers making
such comparison, the number and date of entry, name of. importer, vessel and description of merchandise in regard to
which the protest is made, to be duly stated on the record for
the purpose of identification. This precaution is deemed necessary as well for the protection of the importer as the United
States in the event of the loss of the original protest by acc
dent or otherwise."
The object of this regulation is thus
stated to be in terms to supply secondary evidence in case of
the loss of the original protest. If the original be produced,
the record is of no value, and in any event, the failure of the
collector to conform to the treasury regulation ought not to
prejudice the rights of the importer. The latter would be
powerless to require such record to be made, and the omission

Opinion of the Court.

-

to make it in a particular case should not be imputed to him.
We have already held that the production of the protest from
its proper custody was sufficient evidence that it had been
served according to law.
6. The only remaining question to be considered is that of
prospective protests, and this is really the main question in
the case. In twenty-seven entries there are no protests to be
found, nor is there any record nor any reference in the protest books of the custom-house indicating that any protest
was served in the cases of such entries. These, however, are
claimed by the plaintiffs to be covered by the concluding
clause of the double protest number 6, which is in the following words: "You are hereby notified that we desire and
intend this protest to apply to all future similar importations
made by us." The same clause is found in the protest acconpanying entries number 11 and 13, but in none others. Exhibit Number 14 is a specific protest attached to the entry.
As no claim was made that any specific protest, however
served, had any prospective effect, it follows that the claim
for a repayment of duties on the twenty-four exhibits after
number 13, is based upon the prospective clauses appearing
in the charges and commission form of the pasted papers of
Exhibits Number 6, 11 and 13, or is based on such clause or
clauses, of one or more of these three exhibits. We attach
no significance to the fact that the prospective clause of the
protest is found at the end of the double protest, following
the protest against the duty upon the commission, and is not
found attached to that portion of the protest against the
duty upon the mousselines de laine. As we have already held
that the two protests constitute one paper, it necessarily follows that the concluding clause regarding the prospective
protests should be applied to the entire paper, and to the
protest against the duty upon the goods, as well as upon the
commissions.
The objection to the admission of these papers raised distinctly the question as to the validity of prospective protests.
It is admitted that the doctrine held by the court below upon
the trial of this suit, that the prospective protests set forth

SCHELL'S EXECUTORS v. FAUCH.
Opinion of the Court.

in the clauses attached to the special protests are sufficient as
to all similar importations made by the same importer, is now,
and has been for a long time, the settled law of that court,
and the general practice prevailing in the port of New York.
Such practice is claimed to be authorized by the case of .M4lrHiott v. Brune,. 9 How. 619, decided in 1850. This was also
an action for duties illegally exacted, in which the question
was made as to the validity of a certain protest, which was
somewhat vague in its terms, but was construed by the court
as applying prospectively to all importations of "sugar and
molasses." After this prospective protest the plaintiffs made
a special protest in each of six several importations, but there
were thirteen other importations made after the general protest, respecting which they relied upon the efficacy of the
general protest. The court held -that as the subsequent entries
"all depended on a like principle, - as from the circulars of
the department some doubt existed whether the excess of duties
would not voluntarily be refunded- as the amounts in each
importation were small, and both parties thus became fully
aware that the excess in all such cases was intended to be put
in controversy,.and reclaimed, -we are inclined to think this
written protest may fairly be regarded as applying to all subsequent cases of a like character, belonging to the same parties." This case was in affirmance of the opinion in Brune v.
.Marriott,Taney Dec. 132, in which Chief Justice Taney said
that "a particular protest in each casa is not required by the
law. The object of the protest is merely to give notice to the
officer of the government, that the importer means to claim
the reduction, and to make known to the collector the grounds
upon which he makes the claim. In these receipts this protest
is sufficiently explicit, and covers all the cargoes upon which
the duties had not been finally assessed and adjusted by the
collector." It was said of this case in Davies v. .Miller,130
U. S. 284, 287, that "though criticised in Warren v. Peaslee,
2 Curtis, 231, it was generally regarded and acted on as laying
down a general rule establishing the validity of prospective
protests," citing Steegman, v. .Maxwell, 3 Blatchford, 365;
Hutton v. Schell, 6 Blatchford, 48; and Fowler v. 1?edj)eld

OCTOBER TERM, 1890.
Opinion of the Court.

there cited; Wetter v. Sehell, 11 Blatchford, 193; and Choteau
v. Redfteld, there cited. But as this case has been generally
accepted as settling the law for this court, and the practice
has grown up throughout the country of paying duties under
such protests, -a practice to which eminent judges have lent
their sanction, we think it too late for us to be called upon to
overrule it. It is an acknowledged principle of law, that if
rights have been acquired under a judicial interpretation of a
statute which has been acquiesced in by the public, such rights
ought not to be impaired or disturbed by a different construction, and if, notwithstanding Treasury Regulation Number
3841, requiring protests to be special in each case, a practice
has grown up in the different ports of entry of receiving prospective protests, the annulment of such practice might entail
serious consequences upon importers who had acted upon the
faith of its validity. As early as 1803, it was held by this
court, in Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch, 299, 309, that a practical
construction of the Constitution that the justices of the Supreme Court had a right to sit as circuit judges, although not
appointed as such, was not open to objection. "It is sufficient to observe," says the court, "that practice, and acquiescence under it, for a period of several years, commencing with
tl~e organization of the judicial system, affords an irresistible
answer, and has indeed fixed the construction. It is a contemporary interpretation of the most forcible nature. This
practical exposition is too strong and obstinate to be shaken
or controlled. 'Of course, the question is at rest, and ought
not now to be disturbed." In all cases of ambiguity, the contemporaneous construction, not only of the courts but of the
departments, and even of the officials whose duty it is to carry
the law into effect, is universally held to be controlling.
.AHcJeen v. DeLaney's Lessee, 5 Cranch, 22; Edwards' Lessee
v. Darby, 12 Wheat. 206; United States v. Alexander, 12
Wall. 177; Peabody v. Stark, 16 Wall. 240; Hahn v. United
States, 107 U. S.402; Rogers v. Goodwi, 2 Mass. 475; Endlich on Stats. see. 357. Nor do we think the fact that in
some cases specific protests were filed after the general prospective protest, necessarily shows an intention to abandon

Opinion of the Court.

any future claim under the prospective clause. If it were any
evidence at all of such intent, it might properly be submitted
to a jury, but defendants had no right to a peremptory instruction in their favor.
This disposes of all .the material questions involved, and it
results that the judgment of the court below must be

The question whether or not lands returned as "subject to periodical overflow " are" swamp and overflowed lands" is a question of fact, properly
