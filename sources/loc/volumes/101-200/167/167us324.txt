Statement of the Case.

PARSONS v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 270. Argued April 8, 9, 1897. -Decided

May 24, 1897.

The President has power to remove a district attorney of the United States,
when such removal occurs within four years from the date of the attorney's appointment, and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to
appoint a successor to him.
Section 769 of the Revised Statutes which enacts that "district attorneys

shall be appointed for a term of four years and thbir commissions shall
cease and expire at the expiration of four years from their respective
dates" provides that the term shall not last longer than four years, sub-

ject to the right of the President to sooner remove.
It was the purpose of Congress, in the repeal of the tenure of office sections
of the Revised Statutes, to again concede to the President the power of
removal, if taken from him by the original tenure of office act, and, by
reason of the repeal, to thereby enable him to remove an officer when in
his discretion he regards it for the public good, although the term of
office may have been limited by the words of the statute creating the
office.
The legislative, executive and judicial history of the question reviewed.

THE appellant, on the 4th day of December, 1894, filed
in the Court of Claims an amended petition, in which he
alleged that on the 4th of February, 1890, after his nomination and confirmation, he was duly appointed, qualified and
commissioned for the term of four years as attorney for the
United States for the Northern District of Alabama, and also
to act as such for the Middle District of Alabama; thdt thereupon he entered upon the discharge of the duties of his office;
that he never resigned the same, and that he then resided,
and has continued to reside, since the date of his commission,
in the city of Birmingham, Alabama, and within the Northern
District of Alabama, and that he had given his personal attention to the duties of his office, and that no cause of removal
bad existed since his appointment.
Although the appellant was, as he alleged, duly commissioned as such district attorney, the contents of the commission
do not appear in the petition nor in the record, but it has

been assumed that it contained the usual language, which,
after authorizing and empowering the officer to execute and
fulfil the duties -of the office, proceeds as follows: "To have
and to hold the said office with all the powers, privileges and
emoluments to the same of right appertaining unto him, the
said Lewis E. Parsons, Jr., for the term of four years from
the date hereof, subject to the conditions prescribed by law."
It was further, alleged in the petition that on the 29th day
of May, 1893, the appellant received a written communication
from the President of the United States as follows:
"EXECUTIVE

MANSION,

"Washington, D. C., May 26, 1893.
"SIR: You are hereby removed from the office of attorney
of the United States for the Northern and Middle Districts of
Alabama, to take effect upon the appointment and qualification

of your successor.
"GROVER

"To LEwis E.

CLEVELAND.

PARSONS, JR.,

"Birmingham, Ala."

No charges had been preferred against the appellant.
Under date of Birmingham, Alabama, June 5, 1893, he sent
a written communication to the President of the United States,
at Washington, D. C., in which he said:
"My commission bears date February 4, 1890, and authorizes me to hold said office for the definite term of four Years
from the date thereof, fixed by law, and I am advised by
counsel, and it is my own opinion, that you have no power

to remove me, and I respectfully decline to surrender the
office.
,ery respectfully,
"LEwis E. PARSONS, JR.,
"United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama."

This answer was duly mailed to the President of the United
States, and on the same day, viz., the 5th day of June, 1893,

Statement of the Case.

the appellant notified both the Attorney General of the United
States and Emmet O'Neal that he declined to surrender the
office of attorney of the United States for the Northern
District of Alabama to said O'Neal, who was named by the
President as appellant's successor, his (O'Neal's) appointment
bearing date May 26, 1893.
Upon the 20th day of June, 1893, O'Neal moved the Circuit
Court for the Southern Division of the iNorthern District of
Alabama to require appellant to turn over to him all the books
and papers and other property appertaining to the office, which
motion was resisted by appellant, but was granted by the court,
although it did not adjudicate or determine the question of the
title to the office, or the power of the President to remove the
appellant. -Inre O'Neal, 57 Fed. Rep. 293.
The appellant applied to this court for leave to file a petition
for a writ of mandamus to compel the judge to vacate his
order granting the motion of Mr. O'Neal, which application
was denied, but the merits of the case were not passed upon.
In re Parsons,Petitioner,150 U. S. 150.

The appellant further alleged in his petition that from the
first of January, 1893, to May 26 of that year he had earned
certain fees, which had been duly accounted for and approved
by the District Judge, and that since the 26th of May, and
prior to the 31st day of December, 1893, certain other fees
had been earned for services rendered by Mr. O'Neal, who
had been performing the duties of United States attorney
since the 26th of May, 1893, and that on the whole there
was a balance due appellant for salary and fees duiing the
year 1893, appertaining to his office as district attorney, which
amount had been demanded by appellant and payment had
been refused. Judgment for the amount was demanded.
The usual answer was put in by the United States. It further appears that on the 26th of May, 1893, the Senate of the
United States was not in session, but that in August, 1893, that
body was in session, and that the nomination of Mr. O'Neal
was sent to it, and his appointment was by it consented to and
confirmed, and that he was commissioned as United States district attorney for four years from that time. These facts have

not been stated in the formal finding of facts by the court
below, but they have been referred to by both the counsel in
their briefs in the case as part of the admitted facts, and the
fact of the confirmation of Mr. O'Neal on the 26th day of
August, 1893, by the Senate, is stated by Judge Weldon in
the course of his opinion in this case. 30 C. Cl. 222. The
court below determined, as a conclusion of law, that the appellant was not entitled to recover, and his petition was therefore dismissed.; From that judgment he has appealed to this
court.

MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM,

after stating the. facts, delivered the

opinion of the court.
The question here presented is whether the President of the
United States has power to remove a district attorney, who
had been duly appointed, when such removal occurs within
the period of four years from the date of his appointment,
and to appoint a successor to that officer by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate. The appellant in this case
claims that the President has no such power, and that by
virtue of the appointment of appellant to the office of district
attorney in February, 1890, he was entitled to hold that office
for four years from that date, and to receive the emoluments
appertaining thereto during the same period. He bases his
claim upon sections 767 and 769 of the Revised Statutes.
Section 767 provides for the appointment in each district of
the United States, with the exceptions therein stated, of "a
person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United
States in such district."
Section 769 reads as follows:
" District attorneys shall be appointed for a term of four

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

years and their commissions shall cease and expire at the
expiration of four years from their respective dates. And
every district attorney, before entering upon his office, shall
be sworn to the faithful execution thereof."
The appellant claims that this section gives to every district
attorney the legal right to hold his office for four years, and
that during that time the President has no power to remove
him directly, and the President and Senate have no power to
remove him indirectly by the appointment of a successor, and
that, therefore, he has never been legally removed, and he
bases his claim to recover herein upon that fact.
The first question which arises is in regard to the proper
construction of the above-quoted section. Does it provide for
the continuance in office for four years at all events and for
a termination at the expiration of that period, or does it mean
to provide that the term shall not last longer than four years,
subject to the right of the President to sooner remove? If it
were to be construed in accordance with the claim of appellant, the further question would then arise whether a statute
which fixed a term of office for a district attorney, during the
running of which neither the President, nor the President and
Senate by the appointment of a successor, should have power
to remove the incumbent from office would be constitutional.
It will greatly aid us in giving the proper construction to
this section if we look for a moment at the constitutional
history of the subject relating to the President's power of
removal and at the debates which have taken place in Congress in regardto it. The question arose in the first session
of the first Congress which met after the adoption of the
Constitution.
On the 19th of May, 1789, in the House of Representatives,
Mr. Madison moved "That it is the opinion of this committee
that there shall be established an executive department, to be
denominated the department of -foreign affairs; at the head of
which there shall be an officer to be called the secretary of
the department of foreign affairs, who shall be appointed by
the President by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate; and to be removable by the President."
Subse-

PARSONS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

quently a bill was introduced embodying those provisions.
Mr. Smith of South Carolina said that "He had doubts
whether the officer could be removed by the President; he
apprehended that he could only be removed by an impeachment before the Senate, and that being once in office he must
remain there until convicted upon impeachment; and he
wished gentlemen would consider this point well before deciding it." 1st Lloyd's Cong. Reg. pp. 350, 351. Then ensued
what has been many times described as one of the ablest constitutional debates which has taken place in Congress since
the adoption of the Constitution. It lasted for many days,
and all arguments that could be thought of by men -many
of whom had been instrumental in the preparation and adoption of the Constitution- were brought forward in debate in
favor of or against that construction of the instrument which
reposed in the President alone the power to remove from
office.
After a most exhaustive debate the House refused to adopt
the motion which had been made to strike out the words "to
be removed from office by the President," but subsequently
the bill was amended by inserting a provision that there
should be a clerk to be appointed by the secretary, etc., and
that said clerk, " whenever said principal officer shall be removed from office by the President of the United States, or
in any other case of a vacancy," shall be the custodian of the
records, Qtc., and thereupon the first clause, "that the secretary should be removable from office by the President," was
stricken out, but it was on the well understood ground that
the amendment sufficiently embodied the construction of the
Constitution given to it by Mr. Madison and those who agreed
with him, and that it was at the same time free from the objection to the clajjse so stricken out that it was itself susceptible
to the objection of undertaking to confer upon the President
a power which before he had not. The bill so amended was
sent to the Senate, and was finally passed after a long and
able debate by that body, without any amendments on this
particular subject. The Senate was, however, equally divided
upon it, and the question was decided in favor of the bill by

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

the casting vote of Mr. Adams, as Vice President. Mr. Charles
Francis Adams, in the Life of John Adams (vol. 2, p. 143), in
speaking of this action of the Vice President, says:
"It was the only time, during his eight years of service in
that place that he felt the case to be of such importance as to
justify his assigning reasons for his vote. These reasons were
not committed to paper, however, and can therefore never be
known. But in their soundness it is certain that he never had
the shadow of a doubt. His decision settled the question of
constitutional power in favor of the President, and consequently established the practice under the government which
has continued down to this day.
"Although there have been occasional exceptions taken to
it in argument, especially in moments when the executive
power, wielded by a strong hand, seemed to encroach upon
the limits of the coiSrdinate departments, its substantial correctness has been, on the whole, quite generally acquiesced in.
And all have agreed that no single act of the first Congress
has been attended with more important effect upon the working of every part of the government."
Many distinguished lawyers originally had very different
opinions in regard to this power from the one arrived at by
this Congress, but when the question was alluded to in after
years they recognized that the decision of Congress in 1789,
and the universal practice of the Government under it, had
settled the question beyond, any power of alteration. -(To
this effect see Kent's Com. vol. 1, Lee. 14, p. 310, subject, U. S.
Marshals; Story on the Const. vol. 2, §§ 1542-1544.)
In the subsequent debates in Congress over the removal of
the deposits of the Government, by direction of the President,
from the Bank of the United States, and the dismissal by the
President of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Duane, as a
means to accomplish that purpose, the subject of the power of
the President to remove from office was alluded to by Mr.
Webster, and he admitted the proposition that the President
had the power of removal. Although as an original question
he would have had a different opinion, yet in view of the ac'tion of Congress and the practice of the Government he said:

PARSONS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

"1 regard it as a settled point, settled by construction, settled
by precedent, settled by the practice of the Government, settled by legislation "; and he did not ask to disturb it. In
speaking on that subject, and referring to Mr. Webster's admission, Mr. Evarts, upon the trial of President Johnson, said:
"lHe knew the force of those forty-five years, the whole existence of the nation under its Constitution, upon a question of
that kind; and he sought only to interpose a moral restraint
upon the President, in requiring him, when he removed from
office, to assign the reasons of the removal." (Johnson's Impeachment Trial, vol. 2, p. 314, remarks of Mr. William M.
Evarts, of counsel for the President.)
In I91 re Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259, which was a case involving the validity of an appointment of a clerk of the District
Court of Louisiana by the District Judge thereof, it was said,
by Mr. Justice Thompson, in speaking of the power of removal:
"In the absence of all constitutional provision, or statutory
regulation, it would seem to be a sound and necessary rule to
consider the power of removal as incident to the power of
appointment. This power of removal from office was a subject much disputed, and upon which a great diversity of
opinion was entertained in the early history of this government. This related, however, to the power of the President
to remove officers appointed with the concurrence of the Senate; and the great question was, whether the removal was to
be by the President alone or with the concurrence of the Senate, both constituting the appointing power. No one denied
the power of the President and Senate, jointly, to remove,
where the tenure of the office was not fixed by the Constitution; which was a full recognition of the principle that the
power of removal was incident to the power of appointment.
But it was very early adopted, as the practical construction of
the Constitution, that this power was vested in the President
alone. And such would appear to have been the legislative
construction of the Constitution."
And in speaking of the different language employed in the
act establishing the Navy Department from that which was

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

used in regard to the Department of State, the learned justice further remarked: "The change of phraseology arose,
probably, from its having become the settled and well understood construction of the Constitution that the power of
removal was vested in the President alone, in such cases,
although the appointment of the, officer was by the President
and Senate."
The opinions of the law officers of the Government have
been in harmony with the foregoing views.
In 1847, Attorney General Clifford, subsequently and for
many years one of the justices of this court, in the course of
an opinion given in regard to the claim of Surgeon Du Barry
for back pay, in speaking of this power of the President and
the acquiescence in the result arrived at by the Congress of
1789, said:
"No one ever thought of maintaining that the inferior
offices, so called in the Constitution, should be held during
life. The doubt which arose was, whether the concurrence of
the Senate was not requisite to effect a removal in all cases.
where it is required to consummate the appointment. The
power was finally affirmed to be in the President alone by a
majority of both houses of Congress after great deliberation
and, perhaps, one of the ablest discussions in the history of
the country. 4 Elliott's Debates, 350, 404. That decision
was; acquiesced in at the time, and has since received the sanction of every department of the Government. It is worthy of
special remark that several commentators on the Constitution,
who do not entirely admit the correctness of the construction
adopted, are, nevertheless, constrained to regard the question
as closed. Mr. Justice Story, after reciting the arguments on
both sides, remarks: ' If there has been any aberration from
the true constitutional exposition of the power of removal
(which the reader must decide for himself), it will be difficult,
perhaps impracticable, after forty years' experience, to recall
the practice to the correct. theory.' 3 Story, § 1538. The
remarks of Chancellor Kent are still more decisive on this
point. He says: 'It may now be considered as firmly and
definitely settled; and there is good sense and practical utility

in the construction.' 1 Kent, 311." 4 Opinions Attys. Genl.

In 1851, Attorney General Crittenden, in a written opinion
delivered to the President of the United States, stated that
the President was not only invested with authority to remove
the Chief Justice of the Territory of Minnesota from office, but
that it was his duty to do so if it appeared that he was incom-*
petent and unfi for the place. Speaking of these territorial
judges, Mr. Crittenden said:
"Being civil officers, appointed by the President, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate, and commissioned
by the President, they are not exempted from that executive
power which, by the Constitution, is vested in the President
of the United States over all civil officers appointed by him,
and whose tenures of office are not made by the Constitution
itself more stable than during the pleasure of the President
of the United States."
Concluding he said:
"To answer your inquiry specifically, I have only, in conclusion, to add that, in my opinion, you, as President of the
United States, have the power to remove from office the
Chief Justice of the Territory of Minnesota, for any cause
that may, in your judgment, require it." 5 Opinions Attys.
Genl. 288, 291.
In that case the statute under which the Territory of
Minnesota was organized, act of March 3, 1849, c. 121, § 9,
9 Stat. 403, 406, provided for the appointment of judges of
the Supreme Court, and that they should "hold their offices
during the period of four years." In regard to that provision Mr. Crittenden said, in the opinion above referred to:
"That these territorial judges were appointed under a law
which limited their commissions to the term of four years,
does by no means imply that they shall continue in office
during that term, howsoever they may misbehave. An express declaration in the statute that they should not, during
the term, be removed from office, would have been in conflict
with the Constitution, and would have precluded either the
House of Representatives or tihk President from the exercise

Opinion of the Court.

of their respective powers of impeachment or removal. The
law intended no more than that these officers should certainly,
at the end of that term, be either out of office, or subjected
again to the scrutiny of the Senate upon a renomination."
Attorney General Evarts, in speaking of the tenure of civil
office act, said that it was passed "to change the doctrine and
practice of the Government, by which removal from office, at
the mere discretion of the President, had been established as
a proper, and, as had been thought, a necessary attendant of
the executive duty and responsibility under the Constitution
to maintain the efficiency and fidelity of the public service
in fulfilling the manifold and incessant obligations of administration and in execution of the laws." 12 Opinions Attys.
Genl. 439, 44:6.
This power has been recognized as extending to officers of
the army and navy. Attorney General Cushing, in the case
of Lansing, 6 Opinions Attys. Genl. 4, said:
"I am not aware of any ground of distinction in this
respect so far as regards the strict question of law between
officers of the army and any other officers of the Government.
As a general rule, with the exception of judicial commissions,
they all hold their offices by the same tenure in this respect."
See, also, case of Colonel Belger, 12 Opinions Attys. Genl. 421,

the power of the President to dismiss an officer from the
military service, 15 Opinions Attys. Genl. 421.
The foregoing references to debates and opinions have not
been made for the purpose of assisting u§ in ourselves arriving
at a decision of the question of the constitutional power of
the President in his discretion to remove officials during the
term for which they were appointed-and notwithstanding the
existence of a statute prohibiting such removal, but simply
for the purpose of seeing what the views of the various departments of the Government have been upon the subject of
the power of the President to remove and what claims were
made and how much of acquiescence had been given to the
proposition that to the President belonged the exclusive
power of removal in all cases other than by way of impeach-

PARSONS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

ment. It is unnecessary for us in this case to determine the
important question of constitutional power above stated.
The short review we have taken throws light upon the
question of the true construction of the language used by
Congress in the section of the Revised Statutes under examination. Other legislation will be adverted to.
Before doing so, however, we think it well to comment
upon one or two cases which have been said to indicate a
different view on the part of this court as to the power of the
President. It is said that in the case of Marbury v. Madison,
1 Cranch, 137, it was held that a justice of the peace in the
District of Columbia was not removable at the will of the
President, as his office was one created by Congress, and
the term was limited in the act. The case was an original
application to this court for a mandamus against the Secretary of State to compel him to deliver a commission to the
petitioner which had, as was alleged, been signed by the President and sealed by the Secretary, commissioning the petitioner
as one of the justices of the peace for the District of Columbia
under an act of Congress. The court unanimously held that
it had no jurisdiction to grant an original writ in such case.
Chief Justice Marshall, in the course of his opinion, stated
that "Mr. Marbury, then, since his commission was signed
by the President and sealed by the Secretary of State, was
appointed; and as the law creating the office gave the officer
the right to hold for five years, independent of the executive.
the appointment was not revocable, but vested in the officer
legal rights, which are protected by the laws of his country."
Whatever has been said by that great magistrate in regard
to the meaning and proper construction of the Constitution is
entitled to be received with the most profound respect. In
that case, however, the material point decided was that the
court had no jurisdiction over the case as presented. The
remarks of the Chief Justice in relation to the right of an
appointee to retain possession of an office created by Congress
in and for the District of Columbia, as against the power of
the President to remove him during the term for which he
was appointed, are not necessarily applicable to the case of an

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

officer appointed to an office outside of such District. In the
District of Columbia Congress is given by the Constitution
power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases. Art. I,
§. 8, subdiv. 17, Const. U. S. The view that the President
had no power of removal in other cases outside of the District, as has been seen, is one that had never been taken by
the Executive Department of the Government, nor even by
Congress prior to 1867, when the first tenure of office act was
passed. Up to that time the constant practice of the Government was the other way, and in entire accord with the construction of the Constitution arrived at by Congress in 1789.
The case of United States v. Guthrie, 17 How. 284, has also
been cited upon the same point. The question in that case
was in regard to the right of the relator Goodrich to a writ
of mandamus to compel the Secretary of the Treasury to draw
his warrant to pay the amount of salary -due to the relator,
as he alleged, during the term nominated in his commission
appointing him Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the
Territory of Minnesota. The President had removed him
within the period of four years, the term named in the statute and in his commission. It was in relation to the power
to remove this official appointed under the statute organizing
the Territory of Minnesota that Attorney General Crittenden
gave his opinion, which is above referred to. This court held
that the Circuit Court had no power to issue a writ of mandamus commanding the Secretary of the Treasury to pay a
judge of the Territory of Minnesota his salary for the unexpired term of his office from which he had been removed by
the President of the United States. The question, whether
or not the President had power to remove a territorial judge
during his statutory term of office was argued, but was not
decided in the case. The prevailing opinion was very brief,
and was delivered by Mr. Justice Daniel, and it simply discussed and denied the power of the court to issue the writ.
Mr. Justice McLean delivered his own opinion in regard to
the power of the President to remove, in which he said that
he differed from the opinion of the court in answering the
question as it did, and he was of the opinion that the ques-

PARSONS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

tion as to the power of the President to remove was before
the court, and that such power of removal was not committed
solely to the President. The case is not claimed to be authority for the doctrine asserted by Mr. Justice McLean, and it
can only becited for the purpose of showing that there was
an exception to the general acquiescence in the power of the
President to remove. The case also arose in regard to the
dismissal of a judicial officer of a Territory.
The case of McAllister v. United States, 141 U. S. 174, has
also been cited. There is nothing in that case which gives
any countenance to the doctrine contended for by the appellant. The court there held that a judge of the District Court
of Alaska was not a judge of a court of the United States
within the meaning of the exception contained in section 1768,
Revised Statutes, relating to the tenure of office of civil officers,
and it was held that the judge of the District Court of Alaska,
prior to the repeal of that section, was subject to removal, before the expiration of his term of office, by the President in
the manner and upon the conditions set forth in that section.
Mr. Justice Harlan, in delivering the opinion of the court in
that case, and replying to the suggestion that the conclusion
reached by the court was not in harmony with some observations of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Marbury v. Madison,
stated on page 188, that there was nothing in those observations which militated, in any degree, against the views expressed by him in the case then under consideration, and he
said (p. 189): "The decision in the present case is a recognition
of the complete authority of Congress over territorial offices,
in virtue of 'those general powers which that body possesses
over the Territories of the United States,' as Marbury v.
Madison was a recognition of the power of Congress over
the term of office of a justice of the peace for the District
of Columbia." The case contains nothing in opposition to
the contention as to the practical construction that had been
given to the Constitution by Congress in 1789 and by the
Government generally since that time and up to the act
of 1867.
We may now look at the course of legislation in regard to
VOL. CLXVIi-22

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

the appointment of district attorneys from the earliest period
in our constitutional history down to the repeal in 1887 of
those sections of the Revised Statutes which contained in
substance the provisions of the tenure of office acts.
By section 35 of chapter 20, laws 1789, entitled "An act to
establish the judicial courts of the United States," it was provided, among other things, as follows: "And there shall be
appointed in each district a meet person learned in the law to
act as attorney for the United States in such district, who
shall be sworn or affirmed to the faithful execution of his
office, whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such district all
delinquents," etc. 1 Stat. 73, 92. No provision was made in
the act for the removal of such officer. In the view held by
that Congress as to the power of the President to remove,
it was unnecessary. The legislation remained in this condition until the 15th of May, 1820, when the act (chapter 102
of the laws of that year) was passed entitled "An act to limit
the term of office of certain officers therein named, and for
other purposes." 3 Stat. 582.
The first section of that act provided that from and after
its passage "all district attorneys, collectors of the customs,
naval officers, and surveyors of the customs, navy agents,
receivers of public moneys for lands, registers of the land
office, paymasters in the army, the apothecary general, the
assistant apothecaries general and the commissary general of
purchases, to be appointed under the laws of the United States,
shall be appointed for the term of four years, but shall be
removable from office at pleasure."
This was an act designed, as indicated by its title, and by
the language used in the body of the act, to bring the terms
of those offices named therein to an end after the expiration
of four years. Its purpose clearly was not to grant an unconditional term of office for that period. It was an act of limitation and not of grant.
The provision in the second section, that the commissions
should cease and expire at the end of four years, shows clearly
that the intention of Congress was to restrict what had been
a possible life term of office to a period of not more than

PARSONS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

four years under any one appointment. The provision for a
removal from office at pleasure was not necessary for the
exercise of that power by the President, because of the fact
that he was then regarded as being clothed with such power
in any event. Considering the construction of the Constitution in this regard as given by the Congress of 1789, and
having in mind the constant and uniform practice of the
Government in harmony with such construction, we must construe this act as providing absolutely for the expiration of the
term of office at the end of four years, and not as giving a
term that shall last, at all events, for that time, and we think
the provision that the officials were removable from office at
pleasure was but a recognition of the construction thus almost
universally adhered to and acquiesced in as to the power of
the President to remove.
The legislation in regard to these various officers remained
as provided for in this act of 1820 until the passage of the
first tenure of office act, March 2, 1867, c. 154, 14 Stat. 430.
By that act it was provided that every person holding any
civil office to which he had been appointed by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate, and all who should be thereafter appointed to any such office, "and shall become duly
qualified to act therein, is and shall be entitled to hold such
office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed and duly qualified, except," etc. The reason for the
passage of this well-known act is a matter of history. It was
the result of a contest which sprang up between President
Johnson and the two houses of Congress within a very short:
time after he became President, and which grew in force and
bitterness as the views of Congress on the one side and the
President on the other became more opposed to each other in
the matters regarding the States lately in rebellion and the
proper measures to be pursued for their government. The
act was a portion of the legislation passed by Congress at
that time for the purpose of keeping those men in office who
were then supposed to be friendly to the views of Congress
upon that great subject. On the same day, March 2, 1867,
Congress passed the army appropriation act, 14 Stat. 485, 486,

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

c. 170, by which the headquarters of the general of the army

were established at Washington, and all orders and instructions
relating to military operations issued by the President to the
Secretary of War were directed to be issued through the general of the army. Other provisions were also therein contained for the purpose of restraining the action of the President
in the exercise of his power to remove or suspend the general
of the army. Reference to the subject is made in Blake v.
United States, 103 U. S. 227, 236.
The President, as is well known, vetoed the tenure of office
act, because he said it was unconstitutional in that it assumed
to take away the power of removal constitutionally vested in
the President of the United States -a power which had been
uniformly exercised by the Executive Department of the Government from its foundation. Upon the return of the bill to
Congress it was passed over the President's veto by both
houses and became a law. The continued and uninterrupted
practice of the Government from 1789 was thus broken in
upon and changed by the passage of this act, so that, if constitutional, thereafter all executive officers whose appointments had been made with the advice and consent of the
Senate could not be removed by the President without the
concurrence of the Senate in such order of removal.

Mr. Blaine, who was in Congress at the time, in afterwards
speaking of this bill, said: "It was an extreme proposition a new departure from the long-established usage of the Federal Government-and for that reason, if for no other, personally degrading to the incumbent of the Presidential chair.
It could only have grown out of abnormal excitement created
by dissensions between the two great departments of the
Government.

self-defence against the alleged aggressions and unrestrained
power of the executive department." Twenty Years of Congress, vol. 2, 273, 274.
The conduct of President Johnson in regard to the provisions
of.this act and his contest with Secretary Stanton in relation to
the office of Secretary of War led to his impeachment by the
House and his trial before the Senate, resulting in his acquittal.

PARSONS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

In November, 1868, a new President was elected, who came
into office on the 4th of March, 1869. His relations with
Congress were friendly, and the motive for the passage of
the act of 1867 had ceased to operate. Within five days after
the meeting of Congress a bill was introduced in the House
to repeal the act of 1867, and was passed by that body. In
the Senate, however, the repeal failed, but the act was modified by the act passed on the 5th of April, 1869, 16 Stat. 6, and
the first section of the original act was modified so as to provide as follows:
"That every person holding any civil office to which he
has been or hereafter may be appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and who shall have become
duly qualified to act therein, shall be entitled to hold such
office during the term for which he shall have been appointed,
unless sooner removed by and with the advice and consent of
the Senate, or by the appointment, with the like advice and
consent, of a successor in his place, except as herein otherwise
provided."
Assuming the constitutionality of these acts, it is seen that
under the act of 1869, a person who had been appointed to
an office by and with the advice and consent of the Senate
could yet be removed by and with such advice and consent,
or by the appointment, with the like advice and consent, of
a successor in his place, except as provided in the second section of the act, which provided for appointments during the
recess of the Senate, and for the designation of persons to fill
vacancies which might happen during that time. No further
legislation upon the subject of removals or appointments was
enacted for some years, although repeated but unsuccessful
attempts were made to repeal the act of 1869, and to leave
the President untrammelled by any statute upon the subject,
With the legislation of 1869 in force, this appellant would
under the facts of this case have been legally removed by the
appointment of his successor in the way it occurred.
A revision of the statutes having been undertaken since
1869, section 769 was placed therein as the substance of the
statute of 1820. The section is quoted above. It does not

Opinion of the Court.

contain the affirmative recognition of the power of removal
which is contained in the act of 1820. The reason for the
omission plainly was because the insertion of language in the
section which in so many words recognized a right of removal
would have conflicted with the succeeding sections, embodying
the terms of the tenure of office act, which prohibited removals.
Section 769 was so drawn that in effect it permitted removals
within the term, and it was left to the succeeding sections to
make provisions that should limit the right of removal otherwise existing by virtue of the language of that section. The
same construction of the language of that section should be
adopted which we would apply to the act of 1820, and which
was applied by Attorney General Crittenden and acted upon
by the President, in the case of the chief justiceship of the
Territory of Minnesota, 5 Opinions of Attorneys General, 288,
a construction of limitation and not of grant, a construction
by which no more than a period of four years is permissible,
subject in the meantime to the power of the President to
remove. In thus construing section 769 we think full effect
is given to its language and the practical construction of former periods is adhered to, while at the same time the purpose
of Congress to retain officials in office is also given full effect
by the succeeding provisions upon the subject of the tenure
of office. The right to remain in office is made to depend
upon those subsequent sections, and when in 1887 they were
repealed by Congress, 24 Stat. 500, the full legal force and
effect of the language used in section 769 was permitted to come
in play, freed from the restraints of the sections thus repealed.
Such being the case, the persons appointed under section 769 are
not entitled to hold for four years as against any power of the
President to remove, and in no event can they remain in office
longer than that period without being reappointed. This construction of the act as one of limitation, we think, in the light

of the history of the subject, is a most natural and proper one.
The argument of the appellant, however, shows, if adopted,
that the result of the passage of the repealing statute of 1887
has been to limit the power of the President more than it was
limited before that statute was passed. While the tenure of

PARSONS v. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the Court.

office provisions existed, it is conceded that the President might
remove, an officer like a district attorney within the four years
for which he was commissioned, provided his removal was concurred in by the Senate or was effected by the appointment
of his successor by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate; yet, now since the repeal of those sections which it
was supposed limited and restrained the power of the President, he is still further restrained and limited in his power,
because under the construction as claimed by the appellant he
cannot now remove an officer within the four years' even with
the advice and consent of the Senate or by the appointment of
his successor by the like advice and consent. This extraordinary result is reached by construing, according to appellant's
views, section 769 as meaning to give a term of office of four
years in any event, and while this term of office was, before
the repeal'of the sections above named, subject to be shortened
in accordance with their provisions, yet as they 'have been
repealed it leaves section 769 in force as granting an unconditional and absolute term of four years which cannot be shortened by the President, or the President and Senate combined,
and which leaves the incumbent subject only to removal by
the slow and weary process of impeachment by the House
and a conviction thereon and a removal by the Senate as a
punishment.
This could never have been the intention of Congress. On
the contrary, we are satisfied that its intention in the repeal
of the tenure of office sections of the Revised Statutes was
again to concede to the President the power of removal if
taken from him by the original tenure of office act, and by reason of the repeal to thereby enable him to remove an officer
when in his discretion he regards it for the public good,
although the term of office may have been limited by the
words of the statute creating the office. This purpose is accomplished by the construction we give to section 769, while
the other construction turns a statute meant to enlarge the
power of the President into one circumscribing and limiting it
more than it was under the law which was repealed for the
very purpose of enlarging it.

YARDLEY v. PILLER.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 296. Argued April 28, 189T. - Decided May 24, 1897.

The national banks in Philadelphia organized, for their convenience, a
Clearing House Association, with rules for its business set forth in
detail in the statement in the opinion below. Among these rules, one
provided for the deposit of securities in fixed amounts by each bank
as collateral for their daily settlements; and another for the hours
in the day in which settlements were to be made, and the mode of
making the exchanges. The Keystone Bank made its deposit in conformity with the rule; but, having become indebted to the clearing
house by reason of the receipt of clearing house certificates to a large
amount, the securities deposited by it were surrendered, and were redeposited by it as security for the payment of the certificates. In the
clearing of March 19, 1891, the KeystoUe Bank presented charges against
other banks to the amount of $155,136.41, and the other banks presented
charges against it for $240,549, making the Keystone Bank a debtor in
the clearing for $75,359.08. In accordance with the rule, the Keystone
Bank between the hours of eleven and twelve paid the $75,000 in cash
or its equivalent, and gave its due bill to the manager of the clearing
house for the fractional sum of $359.08, which was deposited by the
manager and checked against by him as cash. In the runners' exchange
of that day, the Keystone Bank owed a balance of $23,021.34, which
balance it settled by giving its due bill to the manager for deposit in
accordance with the system above stated. In operating the clearing on
the morning of March 20, the Keystone Bank, through its runner, delivered to the respective clerks of the various banks packages containing
claims held by the Keystone Bank amounting to $70,005.46, and the settling clerk of the Keystone Bank received from the runners of the other
banks packages containing $117,035.21, leaving the Keystone Bank debtor
in the clearing for $47,029.75. The packages containing the demands
which the Keystone Bank held against other banks, and which had been
delivered to the agent of each of those banks, were by them taken away
at the termination of the clearing. The packages containing the charges
presented against the Keystone Bank, which in the aggregate amounted
to $117,035.21, instead*of being taken away by its settling clerk, were,
under the arrangement Which we have stated, turned over by him to the
