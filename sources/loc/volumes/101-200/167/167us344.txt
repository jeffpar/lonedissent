YARDLEY v. PILLER.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 296. Argued April 28, 189T. - Decided May 24, 1897.

The national banks in Philadelphia organized, for their convenience, a
Clearing House Association, with rules for its business set forth in
detail in the statement in the opinion below. Among these rules, one
provided for the deposit of securities in fixed amounts by each bank
as collateral for their daily settlements; and another for the hours
in the day in which settlements were to be made, and the mode of
making the exchanges. The Keystone Bank made its deposit in conformity with the rule; but, having become indebted to the clearing
house by reason of the receipt of clearing house certificates to a large
amount, the securities deposited by it were surrendered, and were redeposited by it as security for the payment of the certificates. In the
clearing of March 19, 1891, the KeystoUe Bank presented charges against
other banks to the amount of $155,136.41, and the other banks presented
charges against it for $240,549, making the Keystone Bank a debtor in
the clearing for $75,359.08. In accordance with the rule, the Keystone
Bank between the hours of eleven and twelve paid the $75,000 in cash
or its equivalent, and gave its due bill to the manager of the clearing
house for the fractional sum of $359.08, which was deposited by the
manager and checked against by him as cash. In the runners' exchange
of that day, the Keystone Bank owed a balance of $23,021.34, which
balance it settled by giving its due bill to the manager for deposit in
accordance with the system above stated. In operating the clearing on
the morning of March 20, the Keystone Bank, through its runner, delivered to the respective clerks of the various banks packages containing
claims held by the Keystone Bank amounting to $70,005.46, and the settling clerk of the Keystone Bank received from the runners of the other
banks packages containing $117,035.21, leaving the Keystone Bank debtor
in the clearing for $47,029.75. The packages containing the demands
which the Keystone Bank held against other banks, and which had been
delivered to the agent of each of those banks, were by them taken away
at the termination of the clearing. The packages containing the charges
presented against the Keystone Bank, which in the aggregate amounted
to $117,035.21, instead*of being taken away by its settling clerk, were,
under the arrangement Which we have stated, turned over by him to the

Opinion of the Court.
manager of the clearing house, to be retained until at the hour named
the Keystone Bank paid the balance due by it. Before 'the hour for
making the payment, however, the Keystone Bank, by order of the
Comptroller of the Currency, was closed, and subsequently was placed
in the hands of a receiver. On the failure of the Keystone to make the
payment of $47,029.75, the committee of the association instructed the
manager to call on the banks, by whom claims had been presented against
the Keystone, "to redeem the packages against the Keystone Bank."
The manager thereupon gave the proper notification, and the various
banks notified sent their checks and redeemed the packages in question.
Among the obligations for $117,035.21, however, were due bills amounting to $41,197.36. These due bills came from the fractional amounts
arising by the settlement made on the morning of the 19th, to wit,
$359.08; for the due bill given at the runners' settlement on the morning of the 19th, $23,031.44; and for due bills given to various banks
during the course of business on the 19th, amounting to $17,806.84.
Thereupon, and as part of the same transaction, the manager paid from
the $70,005.36, which by his settlement sheet appeared to the credit of
the Keystone as owing from other banks to the Keystone Bank for the
checks surrendered by that bank, the amount of the due bills referred
to, viz., $41,197.36. This left to the credit of the Keystone the sum
of $28,808.10, and this amount was by the manager, acting under direction of the committee of the association, credited on the loan certificate
account of the Keystone Bank with the association. In a suit by the
receiver of the bank to determine the rights of the parties, Held, (1)
That the claim of the receiver that the Keystone Bank was entitled to
)e paid $70,005.36 of credit, irrespective of the outstanding due bills
which it had been expressly agreed between the parties were to be paid
by way of set-off in the clearing, was without foundation; (2) That the
Clearing House Association, having been in possession of the $28,808.10
as the fiduciary agent of the Keystone Bank without a lien or right upon
it, its appropriation of the same after the insolvency of the Keystone
Bank to the debt owing for loan certificates was obviously a preference
within the inhibition of the statute against preferences in the cases of
insolvent banks, Rev. Stat. ยง 5242.

doing business in that city. Its affairs are governed by rules
and regulations adopted by agreement between the banks
forming the association, and the general direction of its
operation is under the control of a president, secretary and
,manager, and of a committee selected by the members of the
association. As the name of the association implies, it is intended to afford a uniform and convenient method by which
daily settlements of balances can be had between the banks
entering into the association. In addition to the function of
affording a means for the daily clearing of balances, the Clearing House Association, by agreement among its members,
issued, at periods when it was deemed best to do so, clearing
house certificates. These certificates were delivered, under
the discretion of the managers, when applied for by a member
of the association, and were secured by the pledge of bills
receivable or assets taken from the portfolio of the bank obtaining the certificates. These certificates were available as
cash in settlements between the banks and for other purposes,
and the object of issuing them was, in times of panic or stringency, to create, to the extent of the certificates, solidarity
of responsibility between the banks, as each bank was liable
for a proportionate share of the certificates in case of default
in their payment, thus fortifying the credit of one by the
credit of all. Moreover, the certificates afforded a means by
which a bank with good assets could use them in order to
obtain certificates which were, for banking purposes, the equivalent of cash, when, from any stringency or panic, the assets
themselves, although entirely sound, could not be readily convertible into current money.
Article 2 of the constitution of the Clearing Association
provided as follows:
" ART. 2. Its object shall -be to effect at one place the daily
exchanges between the several associated banks, consisting
of a morning exchange and a runner's exchange, and the payment, at the same place, of the balances resulting from such
exchanges. The responsibility of the association for such exchanges is strictly limited to the faithful distribution by the
manager, among -the creditor banks for the time being, of

YARDLEY v. PHILLER.
Opinion of the Court.

the sums actually received by him; and should any losses
occur while the said balances are in the custody of the manager, they shall be borne and paid by the associated banks, in
the same proportion as the expenses of the clearing house, as
hereinafter provided for."
Article 11 said:
" ART. 11. Should any of the associated banks fail to appear
at the clearing house at the proper hour, prepared to pay the
balance against it, the amount of that balance shall be immediately furnished to the clearing house by the several banks
exchanging at that establishment with the defaulting bank, in
proportion to their respective balances against that bank,
resulting from the exchanges of the day, and the manager
shall make requisitions accordingly, so that the general settlement may be accomplished with as little delay as possible.
The respective amounts so furnished the clearing house on
account of the defaulting bank will, of course, constitute
claims on the part of the several responding banks against
that bank: Provided,That the amount of the due bill given
by the defaulting bank, in settlement of its debit balance in
the runner's exchange of the previous day, and deposited by
the clearing house in its depository bank, shall be deducted
from the total charge of such bank, and shall be the first
claim against the securities deposited by the defaulting bank,
under article 17."
Article 17 was as follows:
"ART. 17. Each bank, member of the Clearing House Association, shall deposit securities with the clearing house committee as collateral for their daily settlements, in the following
percentage or assessment on capital:
"1st. Banks with capitals of $800,000 and over, ten per
cent.
"2d. Banks with capitals of $500,000 and under $800,000,
fourteen per cent; but not to be required to deposit over
$80,000.
" 3d. Banks with capitals over $250,000 and under $500,000,
twenty per cent; but not to be required to deposit over
$70,000.

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

"4th. Banks with capitals of and under $250,000 shall
deposit not less than $50,000.
"The committee shall apply the deposit of any defaulting
bank to the payment of the balance due by such bank at the
-clearing house, or to the reimbursement, pro rata,of the sev.eral banks furnishing said balance, under article 11; and the
,surplus, if any, shall be held as collateral security for other
indebtedness to members of this association."
By article 9 of the constitution the hour for making the
morning exchange at the clearing house was fixed at eight
and a half o'clock, and the hour for making the runners'
exchange at half-past eleven. By the same article it was provided that a bank becoming a debtor by the morning clearing
must pay the sum debited to it to the clearing house between
the hours of eleven aid twelve o'clock that day, and at twelve
and a half o'clock of the same day the bank being a creditor
in the daily clearing should receive from the manager of the
,clearing house the sum of the credit to which it was entitled.
The settlement at the runners' exchange was made by due
bills, and these due bills were deposited by the manager of the
clearing house in his bank account, kept with one of the banks
belonging to the association, and were checked against by him
as if the due bill were cash. Such due bill, when so received
o1 deposit by the bank and treated by it as cash, became a
credit item, presented by it, in the clearing of the following
morning. In addition, where claims were presented by the
runner of one bank for payment to another bank during the
-course of a business day, the bank by whom the money was
to be paid, to obviate the risk of carrying it, instead of banding over money, gave to the runner a due bill for the amount,
which, on its face, was stipulated to be payable in the clearing
-of the next day.
The Keystone National Bank was a member of the Clearing House Association. It deposited with the association, in
accordance with the rules, securities to guarantee its obligation to meet its daily clearing. It had obtained, moreover,
from the Clearing House Association clearing house certificates
to a large amount, and in December, 1890, by an agreement

YARDLEY v. PfHILLER.
Opinion of the Court.

between the association and the Keystone Bank, the securities
deposited by the Keystone Bank to guarantee its liability to
pay any balance arising from the daily clearing, were returned
to that bank, and were by it deposited anew with the Clearing
House Association as security for clearing house certificates.
It resulted from this transaction that the Keystone Bank did
not have in the hands of the Clearing House Association any
security to guarantee its obligation to meet its daily clearing.
At the time, however, when the securities were withdrawn
and used by the Keystone for the purpose of securing clearing house certificates, an agreement was made that in order to
secure the performance of any obligation which might arise
from the daily clearing the Keystone Bank would leave in the
hands of the manager of the clearing house the vouchers presented by other banks against it at the time the clearing was
made, to be held by the manager until the balance shown to
be due by it in the clearing was paid in accordance with the
agreement. From December, 1890, until the 20th of March,
1891, in execution of this agreement, whenever in the daily
clearing the Keystone Bank owed a balance, it did not take
away the vouchers delivered to its settling clerk, but they
were turned over to the manager of the clearing house to be
held until the obligation of the Keystone Bank resulting from
the clearing was made good.
The operation of making the clearing was accomplished by
thb following method: At the hour named a runner and a
settling clerk representing each bank met at the clearing
house. These representatives of the respective banks brought
with them, in separate sealed packages, the checks which the
banks they represented held against other banks. The runner
of each bank thereupon delivered to the settling clerk of the
others these packages, taking receipts therefor, so that at the
common place of meeting the clerk of each bank received
from every other bank the checks drawn against the bank he
represented. The making up of these packages for exchange
is thus provided for in the rules:
"Rule III. Sealed packages, well gummed and sealed with
wax and endorsed with ink or indelible pencil, shall be used

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

exclusively in the morning exchange and in the runners' exchange, and the amounts stated thereon shall be the basis of
settlement. These packages, with the seals unbroken, shall
be delivered by the messengers of the several banks to their
respective institutions; otherwise, no responsibility shall attach
to the sender."
After these packages had been received the settling clerk
of each bank made up from the indorsements on the packages
delivered to him the debits, and stated the credits arising from
the sum of the packages delivered by the runner of his bank
to the settling clerks of the other banks. The sheets thus
made up were then turned over to the manager of the clearing
house, by whom they were verified and consolidated. The
manager's balance sheet hence, necessarily, contained a statement itemizing the aggregated debits and credits of itl the
banks concerned in the clearing. Where any fractional sumwas due by a bank in consequence of the clearing, this fractional sum was paid to the manager by a due bill, the manager
treating this due bill as cash, deposited it in the bank where
his account was kept and the sum of this due bill became a
credit item in favor of the bank holding it in the clearing of
the next morning.
In the clearing of the 19th of March, 1891, the Keystone
Bank presented charges against other banks to the amount
of $155,136.41, and the other banks presented charges against
itfor $240,549, ' making the Keystone Bank a debtor in the
clearing for $75,359.08. In accordance with the rule, the
Keystone Bank between the hours of eleven and twelve paid
the $75,000 in cash or its equivalent, and gave its due bill to
the manager of the clearing house for the fractional sum of
$359.08, which was deposited by the manager and checked
against by him as cash. In the runners' exchange of that
day, that is, the 19th of March, the Keystone Bank owed a
balance of $23,021.34, which balance it settled by giving its
due bill to the manager for deposit in accordance with the
system above stated. In operating the clearing on the morning of March 20, the Keystone Bank, through its runner, delivered to the respective clerks of the various banks packages

Opinion of the Court.

containing claims held by the Keystone Bank amounting to
$70,005.46, and the settling clerk of the Keystone Bank received from the runners of the other banks packages containing $117,035.21, leaving the Keystone Bank debtor in the
clearing for $47,029.75. The packages containing the demands
which the Keystone Bank held against other banks, and which
had been delivered to the agent of each of those banks, were
by them taken away at the termination of the clearing. The
packages containing the charges presented against the Keystone Bank, which in the aggregate amounted to $117,035.21,
instead of being taken away by its settling clerk, were, under
the arrangement which we have stated, turned over by him
to the manager of the clearing house, to be retained until at
the hour named the Keystone Bank paid the balance due
by it.
Before the hour for making the payment, however, the
Keystone Bank, by order of the Comptroller of the Currency,
was closed, and subsequently was placed in the hands of a
receiver. On the failure of the Keystone to make the payment of $47,029.75, the committee of the association instructed
the manager to call on the banks, by whom claims had been
presented against the Keystone, "to redeem the packages
against the Keystone Banlk" ; in other words, "to redeem the
amounts which they had been credited with on the manager's
balance sheet, in settlement of the account of checks drawn
on the Keystone Bank." Not being able from his records to
ascertain what banks to call upon to make the payment of
$117,035.21, the manager sent to the Keystone Bank, and
received from that institution their settlement and package
sheets for that day. On receipt thereof, the manager thereupon gave the proper notification, and the various banks notified sent their checks and redeemed the packages in question.
Among the obligations for $117,035.21, however, were due
bills amounting to $41,197.36. These due bills came from
the fractional amounts arising by the settlement made on the
morning of the 19th, to wit, $359.08; for the due bill given at
the runners' settlement on the morning of the 19th, $23,031.44;
and for due bills given to various banks during the course of

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

business on the 19th, amounting to $17,806.84. Thereupon,
and as part of the same transaction, the manager paid from
the $70,005.36, which by his settlement sheet appeared to the
credit of the Keystone as owing from other banks to the
Keystone Bank for the checks surrendered by that bank,
the amount of the due bills referred to, viz., $41,197.36. This
left to the credit of the Keystone the sum of $28,808.10, and
this amount was by the manager, acting under direction of
the committee of the association, credited on the loan certificate account of the Keystone Bank with the association. The
result of the transaction was a reduction of the claims which
had been originally made against the Keystone Bank in the
exchanges of the 20th of March, 1891, from $117,035.21 to
$41,197.36, and a return to the various banks of $75,837.85 of
checks and drafts received from their customers. Whilst the
record does not affirmatively show the fact, it is fairly inferable from it that these checks, etc., aggregating $75,837.85,
were immediately charged back by the banks by whom they
had been received and were returned to the depositors from
whom they had received them, and therefore reached ultimately the drawers, who were depositors in the Keystone
Bank, thus leaving the Keystone Bank liable for their amount
in its deposit account with its depositors.
On February 19, 1894, the receiver of the Keystone Bank
filed his bill in this cause in the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, setting forth
the relations between the Keystone Bank and the clearing
house, and detailing the transactions of the 20th of March,
1891, substantially as we have stated them; alleged an appropriation by the association to its own use, after the insolvency
of the Keystone Bank, and in violation of the statutes of the
United States, of the checks and drafts which had been surrendered at the clearing house by the Keystone Bank on the
morning of the 20th of March, as hereinbefore stated, and also
alleging an appropriation and application to the use of the
association of bonds of the Baltimore Traction Railway Com,pany of the par value of $100,000, which it was claimed had
been specifically deposited by the Keystone Bank as security

YARDLEY v. PHILLER.
Opinion of the Court.

for the payment of any balance which might be owing by it
in the daily clearing. It was averred that demand had been
made on the association, and that it had refused to account to
the receiver for the said checks, drafts and bonds. A discovery was asked and relief prayed that the association surrender
the checks, drafts and bonds, or, in the alternative, that the
association be decreed to pay the amount collected thereon
with interest. The answer of the association detailed most
of the facts heretofore recited and averred the lawfulness of
the appropriation made of the $70,005.36. As to the traction
bonds, it was averred that they were deposited as security for
loan certificates, and that they had been sold and the proceeds duly accounted for in the account as to such certificates.
The claim of the receiver as to these bonds was subsequently
abandoned.
A decree was entered in the Circuit Court adjudging that
the receiver recover from the defendants $70,005.36 with interest from March 20, 1891. 58 Fed. Rep. 746. On appeal,
the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decree, and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to dismiss
the bill of complaint. 17 U. S. App. 647. From this latter
decree an appeal-was taken to this court. The opposing judgments rendered by the Circuit Court and by the Circuit Court
of Appeals well define the conflicting contentions of the parties, since the conclusion of the Circuit Court entirely sustained the position taken by the complainant while the Court
of Appeals justified the rights asserted by the defendants.
The receiver of the Keystone Bank argues that the result
of the transactions at the clearing house on March 20, 1891,
after the failure of the bank, was to wholly dismiss the Keystone Bank from the clearing and leave it with a claim of
$70,000 against the clearing house, which it is entitled to
have paid in full without reference to all or any of the debts
due by it, which otherwise would have been properly chargeable in the clearing. In other words, the Keystone Bank,
although it put into the clearing only claims against other
banks sufficient to partially discharge its obligations, and
failed subsequently to perform the duty, owing by it, to pay
VOL. CLXVIi-23

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

in cash a sum adequate to make up the difference, that is, to

discharge all its debts resulting from the clearing, asserts that
as a consequence of its failure to pay all it has been absolved
from thereafter paying anything whatever in the clearing.
Or, stated in another form, the argument is this: As the
banks which held checks on the Keystone Bank, when they
received these checks from the clearing house, charged them
back to their depositors, and therefore made them obligations
due by the Keystone Bank on its deposit account with its depositors, these banks elected to consider the Keystone Bank
as no longer connected with the clearing house, and hence
also lost their right to compensate the credit of the Keystone
Bank by such other obligations, outside of the checks, which
were properly entitled to and had actually figured in the
clearing, such as due bills, etc., which these banks had not
charged back, because they were not of the nature to be so
charged, as they were when presented in the morning clearing held by the banks for their own account. It is clear then
that the claim of the receiver of the Keystone Bank is that,
by the default of that bank, its liability to have its claim in
the clearing compensated by its due bills held by other banks
was cancelled, and hence that it was in a much better position
by its failure than it would have been if it had not suspended
and had furnished the funds to pay all the claims presented
against it in the clearing.
On the other hand, the claim of the Clearing House Association is that it owes nothing, and that by the default of the Keystone Bank the clearing house became entitled to appropriate
the balance of the credit due the Keystone Bank in the clearing, to debts due to the clearing house, although such debts
were not of a nature to have authorized them to be charged
against the clearing if the failure had not taken place. That
is, the clearing house also contends that the effect of the failure
was to give it rights against the Keystone Bank which it would
not have had if the failure had not taken place.
The claims of both parties, therefore, when analyzed, amount
to the assertion, as a proposition of law, that they both have
greater rights in consequence of the insolvency than they

YARDLEY v. PHILLER.
Opinion of the Court.

would have had if the insolvency had not taken place. The
self-evident error of this proposition points to the unsoundness
of the claims of both parties to the controversy.
We will demonstrate that this is the case by considering the
situation of the parties in order thereby to determine their
respective rights against and obligations towards each other.
A clear ascertainment of the legal status of the parties will be
at the outset greatly facilitated by first considering a matter
much discussed in argument, viz.: what, if any, bearing the
payment of $117,035.21 to the manager of the clearing house by
sundry members of the association has upon this controversy.
In the manager's settlement sheet of the daily clearings
between the banks, made up from the data contained in the
settlement sheets prepared by the settling clerk of each bank
at the close of the clearing, there was set out in the centre of
the sheet, running from top to bottom, a list of banks, each
bank being given a number ranging from 1 to 43. In a column
to the left of the number and name of each bank there was a
list of debit items, each item indicating that the sum stated
was owing from the bank opposite to which it was placed, for
checks and drafts and due bills which had been presented
against that bank by other banks in the association. The
banks which had presented these checks, drafts and due bills
were given credit therefor on the credit side of the sheet, in a
column to the right of the name of each bank, as being claims
in their favor against the debit items due from other banks.
The aggregate of the debit items was therefore the fund
from which the aggregate of the credit item was to be paid.
The two necessarily balanced each other.
If, as the result of the failure of the Keystone Bank and the
return to the banks, which had presented them, of the packages
in question, the sum of $117,035.21 had been stricken from the
debit side of the manager's sheet, the effect necessarily would
have been that the totals on the credit side -would have been
just that much greater than the total of the debit side, and,
therefore, there would have been a shortage of that amount
in the execution of the clearing. It follows that in paying
the aggregate credits the manager of the clearing house would

OCTOBER TERM, 1896.
Opinion of the Court.

have been short that much money. In other words, to have
paid the banks who had presented the checks against the
Keystone Bank the sum of their claims against all the banks
in the association, as shown by the credit side of the manager's
sheet, the manager necessarily would have had to make good
the shortage by paying less to that amount to the banks who
had received an increased credit because of the expected payment of the debit item charged against the Keystone. That
is to say, the deficiency on the credit side which would have
resulted from taking out the $117,035.21 debit due by the
Keystone would have caused the loss to fall on the banks
which had presented the claims against the Keystone, because
they would have received that much less on the aggregate
amount due to them from the entire clearing, that is, from all
the other banks. Instead of doing this, however, and in order
to render his settlement regular in form, the manager called
upon the banks who had presented the claims against the
Keystone Bank to substitute money for these claims, so that
this money, paid in by them in response to the call, might take
the place of the amount of $117,035.21, and thus cause the
debit and credit side to agree, and enable him to carry out
the clearing just as it had been made in the early morning.
The effect of this was not to change the situation at all, since
if the $117,035.21 had not been paid in, the loss would have
fallen on the banks who had received credit, because they
had presented claims against the Keystone amounting to
$117,035.21. It results that by paying in the amount called
for and having it put fictitiously on the sheet, in lieu' of the
$117,035.21 due from the Keystone Bank the banks paying in
the amount neither gained nor lost, since they immediately
received back the amount when the clearing was carried out.
Whilst the transaction then assumed the form of a payment
of $117,035.21 by the banks called upon, it was in reality no
payment at all, for it simply enabled the money paid in to be
considered as on one side of the account in order to be handed
back to them on the other. This is the inevitable result of
the transaction, which, besides, is clearly shown by the testimony of Mr. Boyd, the manager of the clearing house, who

YARDLEY v. PHILLER.
Opinion of the Court.

says that the payment of the $117,035.21 was a mere matter
of bookkeeping.
When it is understood that the payment in of the money
in consequence of the call made upon the banks was in reality no payment at all, since it was but the giving on the one
hand to the manager of a sum of money to be handed back
by him on the other in order that his settlement sheet might
balance, it becomes perfectly clear that the result was in no
way to change or destroy the credit of $70,005.36 standing on
the clearing sheet in favor of the Keystone Bank. This latter amount was the sum of checks which the Keystone Bank
had surrendered at the morning exchange to the settling
clerks of the banks upon which such checks were drawn.
As a result of such surrender, the Keystone Bank was entitled
to receive out of the debits paid by other banks the sum
named. The banks which owed that sum were charged in
the debits as owing that amount to the clearing house, and
when, as they did, they settled their indebtedness to the clearing house the manager thereof necessarily received that sum
for account of the Keystone Bank. The banks which for
mere bookkeeping purposes had paid in a sum of money and
at once received it back certainly cannot be permitted -to
claim that the effect of this transaction was to destroy the
rights of the Keystone Bank on the credit side of the clearing, which rights of necessity resulted from the paying into
the clearing house of the aggregate debits.
But these banks who paid in their money, under the call,
and received it back, whilst they were not in a position, in
consequence of having done so, to enable them to assert that
the credit of the Keystone had disappeared, were certainly
not thus put in a positiofi by which they could not exercise
their lawful claims upon the credit of the Keystone. The
claims which, as we have seen by the rules of the clearing
house and the contracts between the parties, were to be
mutually compensated, in the clearing, one with the other,
were the due bills and the items of bankers' exchange checks,
drafts, etc. The $117,035.21 against the Keystone Bank
contained $75,837.99 of checks and drafts, and the remainder

consisted of due bills. These checks and drafts, on the failure of the Keystone Bank, were charged back by the banks
who held them to those who had deposited them, and in consequence, presumably, ultimately reached the hands of tile
depositors of the Keystone, by whom the checks were drawn.
The right of the bank holding a check against the Keystone
Bank, on the failure of that bank, to charge back the checks
was unquestionable. Indeed, it was not only to the interest,
but it was the duty, of the banks towards their stockholders
to do this, for if they had held the checks, without charging
them back, they would have become responsible for them, and
therefore would have assumed a debt which they were under
no obligation to assume. Having exercised the right to return
the checks, there arose a resulting obligation on the banks not
to continue to present against the Keystone Bank, for payment out of its credit in the clearing, obligations for which
there was no longer a right to make a claim. Deducting,
therefore, the $75,837.99 of checks, it left only the due bills,
$41,197.26, which were paid by the manager of the clearing
house out of the $70,005.36 to the credit of the Keystone
Bank. This payment of course extinguished the due bills
and reduced the credit of the Keystone Bank ($70,005.36) to
the extent of the payment of $41,197.26, leaving, therefore,
a balance to the credit of the Keystone Bank of $28,808.10
unappropriated by anything resulting from or entering into
the clearing. This sum the Clearing House Association at
once appropriated in reduction of an indebtedness due it by
the Keystone Bank upon the loan certificate account, an
account which had arisen from loan certificates which the
Keystone Bank had previously obtained from the clearing
house, secured by collaterals, as already stated.
From the foregoing it obviously results that the claim of
the receiver that the Keystone Bank was entitled to be paid
$70,005.36 of credit, irrespective of the outstanding due bills
which it had been expressly agreed between the parties were
to be paid by way of set-off in the clearing, is without foundation. This conclusion leaves only for consideration the question whether the Clearing House Association possessed the

Opinion of the Court.

right to appropriate and impute the $28,808.10 of balance
in its hands and due to the Keystone Bank towards the
payment of the indebtedness of the Keystone Bank for
loan certificates.
It is undisputed that there was no agreement between the
clearing house and the Keystone Bank by which the sums due
to the latter, in the clearing, could be applied to the loan
certificate account. It is obvious that the Clearing House
Association was an agent and fiduciary representative of
all the banks forming the association. When the nature of
the loan certificates and the relation of the Clearing House
Association to its members is thus understood, the question
whether the Clearing House Association had a right to take
as it did the clearing credit of the Keystone and apply it to
the debt in question, in reason, answers itself. As said in
Reynes v. Dumort, 130 U. S. 354, 391, "A general lien does
not arise upon securities accidentally in the possession of a
bank, or not in its possession in the course of its business as
such, or where there is a particular mode of dealing, inconsistent with such general lien."
The Clearing House Association having been therefore in
the possession of the $28,808.10 as the fiduciary agent of the
Keystone Bank without a lien or right upon it, its appropriation of the same after the insolvency of the Keystone Bank
to the debt owing for loan certificates was obviously a preference within the inhibition of the statute against preferences
in the cases of insolvent banks. Rev. Stat. ยง 5242.
But want of power in the clearing house to absorb the
$28,808.10 belonging to the Keystone necessarily follows,
even if we eliminate from view all claim of lien or all question
of fiduciary relation, and consider the matter solely under the
priiciples of the general law of set-off. It is certain that all
or any portion of the $70,005.36 entered on the clearing sheet
and resulting from the claims presented against other banks
by the Keystone Bank, in the cleafing of that morning, was a
debt due by the clearing house, not to the Keystone Bank,
but to the other banks who had presented claims against the
Keystone in excess of the $70,005.36. This is shown by the

OCTOBER TERM, 1896
Opinion of the Court.

fact that up to the time of the insolvency not only did the Keystone Bank have no claim against the clearing house, but it
was under obligation to pay $47,029.75, the difference between
the sum which it had presented and the sum of the claims presented against it. iNot only, therefore, all of the $70,005.36
presented by the Keystone Bank in the clearing, but the
$47,029.75, which it had to pay, belonged to other banks, and
hence up to the time of the insolvency the Keystone was a
debtor and not a creditor. The credit of $28,808.10 which
the clearing house impounded arose as a result of the transactions between the parties, after the announcement of the
insolvency of the Keystone was made, that is, the credit of
$28,808.10 was solely caused by the withdrawal, after the
insolvency, by certain banks of checks and drafts which they
held against the Keystone Bank. It was only when, in consequence of the failure of the Keystone to pay the sum due by
it to the other banks, and thereupon these banks exercised
their undoubted right to make this withdrawal, and charge
back to the persons from whom they had received them the
checks and drafts against the Keystone, that that credit in the
favor of the Keystone arose. But this withdrawal was confessedly made after the declared insolvency, and hence the
credit which the withdrawal caused could only have arisen
after that time. The claim of the clearing house, therefore,
is that a fund put in its hands for account of certain banks
having become the property of the Keystone after the insolvency of the latter, by a partial release granted by the banks
in whose 'favor the fund existed, therefore there instantly arose
on the part of the clearing house a right to set off its certificate account held against the Keystone by the sum of the fund
so created after insolvency. But, obviously, the right to set
off, as recognized in Scott v. Armstrong, 146 U. S. 499, is to be
governed by the state of things existing at the moment of
insolvency, and not by conditions thereafter created. The
case under this aspect is directly controlled by Nashville
Security Bank v. Butler, 129 U. S. 223, and, indeed, is governed by the general principle announced in Davis v. Elmira
Savings Bank, 161 U. S. 275.

YARDLEY v. PHILLER.
Opinion of the Court.

Whilst, however, we find the appropriation of the $28,808.10
to have been unlawful, the record is not in such a shape as to
enable us to dispose finally of the controversy. As we have
said, the bill of the complainant sought not only the recovery
of the entire $70,065.36 credit shown on the manager's clearing sheet, but also an accounting for certain bonds which it
was claimed had been held by the clearing house as collateral
for the payment of the daily balances in the clearing. The
proof having shown that these collaterals were not held as
security for the clearing but for the loan certificates, this
claim was abandoned. But from the evidence offered in relation to this item and found in the record, there is a statement
of the condition of the loan certificate account between the
clearing house and the Keystone Bank or its receiver. This
statement shows that after reducing the loan certificate
account by the $28,808.10 credit, resulting from having appropriated the balance in the clearing, as above stated, and after
having realized on certain assets held as collateral for that
account, there was a balance of $9695.62 in cash to the credit
of the Keystone Bank or its receiver. That is to say, after
putting the clearing house -in funds to discharge all the loan
certificates, it had in cash nearly ten thousand dollars to the
credit of the receiver. The statement moreover shows that in
addition to this cash there were in the hands of the clearing
house collaterals held for the loan certificates and which had
not been realized, amounting to $331,941.47, and besides that'
there was a balance due on collateral notes, in process of collection, amounting to $16,397.72. Necessarily, if the appropriation made by the clearing house of the $28,808.10 be
stricken from the loan certificate account, the amount due to
the Clearing ,House Association by the Keystone or its
receiver will be increased by that amount, and this would
absorb the sum of $9695.62 credited thereon as shown by the
account in the record, and leave a balance besides against the
Keystone. The uncollected collaterals would, of course, be a
guarantee for the payment of the balance, and the ultimate
sum due, after exhausting all the collaterals, would be a claim
against the receiver, entitle4 to its distributive share from the

assets of the Keystone Bank. The record fails to disclose
whether the receiver of the Keystone Bank has taken the collaterals and the balance of cash stated in the account. If he
has, the issues are settled, for plainly he cannot be permitted,
after having taken the collaterals or the dash balance, upon
the theory that the loan certificate account has been extinguished by imputing thereto the $28,808.10, and then in this
suit seek to recover by repudiating the credit.
We conclude, therefore, that the ends of justice require that
the result of the dealings between the parties should be ascertained and settled before a final decree passes, and that to
accomplish this purpose
It will be necessary to reverse both the decrees of the Circuit
Court of Appeals and of the Circuit Court, and to remand
the cause with directions to allow the parties if necessary
to reform their pleadings so that their rights may be determined in conformity with the foregoing opinion, the costs
of the Circuit Court of Appeals to be borne by the receiver,
those of this court by the appellees, those in the Circuit
Court to abide the final result.
