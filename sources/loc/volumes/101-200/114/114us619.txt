UNITED STATES v. CORSON.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
Submitted April 22, 188.-Decided May 4. 188.

An officerof volunteers, in the army, dismissed from the service during the
recent civil war, by order of the President, could not be restored to his
position merely by a subsequent revocation of that order.
The vacancy so created could only be filled by a new appointment, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, unless it occurred in the recess of that
body, in which case the President could have granted a commission to expire at the end of its next succeeding session.'

-The facts which make the case, are' stated in the opinion of
the court.

M.t. XUsTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from a jtidgment of the Court of Claims in
favor of appellee for the sum of $538; $328 of 'which represents his claim for pay as a 'aptain and assistant quartermaster
of volunteers from March 27, 1865, to June 9, 1865, and $210,
his claim for pay allowedby t6e acts of March 3, 1865, ch. 81,

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.
Opinion of the Court.

ยง 4, 13 Stat. 497, and July 16, 1866, ch. 181, 14 Stat. 94; the
first of which acts provides that all officers of volunteers in commission, at its date, below the rank of brigadier-general, who
should continue in the military service to the close of the war,
should be entitled to receive, upon being mustered out of the
service, three months' piay proper; and the last of which extended the provisions of the first act to all officers of volunteers
below the rank of brigadier-general, who were in the service
on March 3, 1865, and whose resignations were presented and
accepted, or who were mustered out at their own request, or
otherwise honorably discharged from the service after the 9th
of April,:1865.
The facts are: Appellee enlisted as a private soldier in the
military service of the United States in August, 1861. Having
been promoted from time to time, he was commissioned prior
to March 27, 1865, as captain and assistant quartermaster of
volunteers. His ervice was continuous from August, 1861, to
March 27, 1865, on which day he was, by order of President
Lincoln, dismissed the service. But, on June 9, 1S65, an order
was issued by President Johnson revoking the order of dismissal, and restoring him to his former position. IBy an order
issued from the War Department under date of June 19, 1865,
he was assigned to duty as division quartermaster of the 1st
Division, 1st Army Corps, with the temporary rank, pay, and
emoluments of major in the Quartermaster's Department under
the act of July 4, 1864. He held the latter position until
October 7, 1865, when he was honorably mustered out of the
service of the United States.
It does not appear that there was any attempt, between
March 27,1865, and June 9, 1865, to fill the vacancy by another
appointment.
In Blake v. United States, 103 U. S. 227, 231, it was said
that "from the organization of the government, under the present Constitution, to the commencement of the recent war for
the suppression of the rebellion, the power of the President, in
the absence of statutory regulations, to dismiss from the service an officer of the army or navy was not questioned in any
adjudged case, or by any department of the government."

UNITED STATES v. CORSON.
Opinion of the Court.

See also .7JElratL v. United States, 102 U. S. 426; -eyes v.
United States, 109 U. S4 336, 339. But ยง 17 of the act of July
27, 1862, ch. 200, 12 Stat. 596, authorized and requested the
President to dismiss and discharge from the military service,
either in the army, navy, marine corps, or volunteer force, any
officer for any cause which, in his judgment, either rendered
such officer unsuitable for, or whose dismission would promote,
the public service. In accordafice with these decisions, it must
be held that that act, if not simply declaratory of the long
established law, invested the President with authority to make
the order of March 27, 1865, dismissing appellee from the service of the United States. No restriction or limitation was
imposed upon his authority, in that regard, until the passage
of the act of July 13, 1866, ch. 176, 14 Stat. 92, repealing the
seventeenth section of the act of July 17, 1862, and by which,
also, it was declared that "no officer in the military or naval
service shall, in time of peace, be dismissed*from the service,
except upon and in pursuance of a sentence of a court-martial
to that effect, or in commutation thereof." That act did not go
into effective operation, throughout the whole of the United
States, until August 20, 1866; for, not until that day, was the
war against the rebellion recognized by the President and
Congress as having finally ceased in every-part of the Union.
.AeLlrath v. United Stqtes, 102 U. S. 426, 438.
In view of these adjudications, it is not to be doubted that
the effect of the order of March 27, 1865, dismissing appellee
from the service, was to sever his relations with the army.
Thenceforward and until, in some lawful way, again appointed,
he was disconnected from that branch of the public service as
completely as if he had never been an officer of the army.
So that his right to pay as captain and assistant quartermaster
of volunteers, from the date of his dismissal from the service
by President Lincoln to the date of the order of President
Johnson, depends -entirely upon the question whether an officer
of the army, once lawfully dismissed from the service, can regain his position and become entitled to its emoluments by
means of a subsequent order revoking the order of dismissal
and restoring him to his former position.

OCTOBER TERM, 1884.

Syllabus.

This question must be answered in the negative upon the
authority.of 3fimmack v. United States, 97 U. S. 426. The
death of the incumbent could not more certainly have made
a vacancy than was created by President Lincoln's order
of dismissal from the service. And such vacancy could only
have been filled by a new and original appointment, to which,
by the Constitution, the advice and consent of the Senate were
necessary; unless the vacancy occurred in the recess of that
body, in which case, the President could- have granted a commission to expire at the end of its next succeeding session.
Const. Art. II. Section 2.
It results that, as the appellee was dismissed from the army
during the recent war by a valid order of the President,.and as
he was not reappointed in the mode prescribed by law, he was
not entitled, as an officer pf the army, to the pay allowed by
statute for the period in question.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to dsmliss the 2etition.

Argued April 3, 1884.-Decided May 4,18S5.

The terms "imports"

and "exports" in Art. 1, Sec. 10, Clause 2. of the Con-

stitution, prohibiting States, without the consent of Congress, from levying
duties on imports or exports, has reference to goods brought from, or carried to foreign countries alone, and not to goods transported fr~m one State
to another.
Woodruff v. Parham,8 Wall. -128, arirmed and applied.
A general State tax, laid alike upon all property, does not infringe that clause
of the Constitution if it happens to fall upon goods which, though not then
intended for exportation, are subsequently exported.
Article 1, Section 8, clause 8 of the Constitution, which confers upon Congress
the power to regulate commerce among the several States, leaves to the States
in the absence of Congressional legislation, the power to regulate matters
of local interest, which affect inter-State commerce only incidentally; but
the power of Congress over inter-State commerce is exclusive wherever
