CALUMET GRAiN & ELEVATOR CO. v. CHICAGO. 431
Opinion of the Court.

this case to decide. It is only necessary to say that the act of
1899 does not manifest the purpose of Congress to go to that
extent under the power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce and thereby to supersede the original authority of the
States. The effect of that act, reasonably interpreted, is to
make the erection of a structure in a navigable river, within
the limits of a State, depend upon the concurrent or joint assent of both the National Government and the state government. The Secretary of War, acting under the authority conferred by Congress, may assent to the erection by private parties
of such a structure. Without such assent the structure cannot
be erected by them. But under existing legislation they must,
before proceeding under such an authority, obtain also the assent of the State acting by its constituted agencies.
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Circuit Court is
Afflrmed.

This case relates to the construction of a dock in Calumet

facts upon which that company principally bases its claims for
relief are those upon which the plaintiffs relied in CUmmings

that case, the judgment in this case is

Apnkm~d.
