Statement of the Case.

HOOKER v. LOS ANGELES.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OALIFORNIA.
,No. 149. Argued January 23, 1903.-Decided February 23, 1903.
Where the controversy in the state court does not involve the construction
of the treaty of 1848 with Mexico, but only the validity of the title of
certain Mexican and Spanish grants made prior to the treaty, no Federal
question is involved.
The Fourteenth Amendment does not control the power of a State to determine the form of procedure by which legal rights may be ascertained,
if the method adopted gives reasonable notice and affords a fair opportunity to be heard.
Where the validity, on account of repugnancy to the Federal Constitution,
of statutes of California as to the paramount right of the City of Los
Angeles to the surface and subterranean waters of the Los Angeles River
is not drawn in question in the trial or in the Supreme Court of the
State, the decisions of the state courts will not be reviewed in this court.

THis is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the State of
California to review a judgment of that court affirming the judgment of the Superior Court of the county of Los Angeles, California, in favor of the city of Los Angeles, and against Hooker
and Pomeroy. The city brought suit against Hooker and Pomeroy, to condemn all their "estate, right, title, and interest," in
and to certain tracts of land, described in the complaint, for
the purpose of enabling the city "to construct and maintain
thereon the ' headworks' of its projected system for supplying
water to its inhabitants for private and municipal purposes."
All questions except the amount of compensation to be awarded
were by stipulation tried by the court. The jury returned a
verdict awarding $23,000 as the value "of an estate in fee simple
in the lands described in the complaint, including all their elements of value, subject to the paramount right of the city or
Los Angeles to take from the Los Angeles River, from time to
time, all the water that may be needed at such time for the use
of the inhabitants of said city, and for all municipal and public
uses and purposes therein," and $2000 as damages to the re-

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after making the foregoing state-

ment, delivered the opinion of the court.
We cannot find in the pleadings or other proceedings in the
trial court, or in the Supreme Court, that any statute of California was asserted to be in conflict with the Constitution, or
any law or treaty of the United States, or that any right was
claimed by plaintiffs in error under the Constitution, or any
treaty or statute of the United States.
The city alleged in its complaint that the Los Angeles River
was a non-navigable stream, rising a few miles to the north and
northwest of the city, and fed by streams rising to the surface
in or near the bed of the river; that that bed was composed of
sandy soil, into which the water sank and formed subterranean
streams flowing beneath the bed and then rising to the surface;
that the river flowed through the land sought to be condemned
before reaching the city; that the city was the owner of the
exclusive right to the use of all the water of the river in trust
for the public purposes of supplying the inhabitants of the city
with water for domestic use, supplying water for the irrigation
of land embraced within the pueblo lands of the city, and other
municipal uses; that plaintiffs in error were owners of the fee
simple of the lands described, subject to the rights of the city
to the water of the river; and the prayer was for the condemnation in fee simple of all the estate, right, title and interest of
plaintiffs in error in the land.

OCTOBER TERI, 1902.
Opinion of the Court.

The answer of plaintiffs in error denied that the river was
fed by springs rising to the surface in or adjoining the bed of
the river; admitted that the bed was composed of sandy soil,
but denied that the waters of the river formed well-defined
subterranean streams flowing in channels beneath the bed, or
that such subterranean waters rose before reaching the city,
or became a part of the surface water of the river; and denied
that the city was the owner of any right to the use of all the
water of the river, in trust, or otherwise; denied that the city
had any right in the water or to the use thereof, other than as
a riparian owner of lands through which the river flowed, and
rights acquired by appropriation; and denied that the city
owned the right to the water of the river to the exclusion of
plaintiffs in error. On the contrary, the answer alleged that
the lands of plaintiffs in error were riparian lands situated far
above the north boundary of the city, and that, as riparian
owners, plaintiffs in error were entitled to the use of the waters
of the river for all lawful purposes, and, to a reasonable extent,
for irrigating those lands and for domestic and other uses. And
it set up grants of part of the land to the predecessors of plaintiffs in error in 1843 by the governor of both Californias, and of
the remainder of the land by grant in 1781; that confirmation
was petitioned for before the board of land commissioners appointed under the act of Congress of 'March 3, 1851, the grants
confirmed, and the decrees of the board affirmed by the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of
California, and patents duly issued; and averred that plaintiffs
in error claimed title "under and through the aforesaid Mexican and Spanish grants, and the proceedings for the confirmation thereof, and the said patents issued by the United States
founded thereon ;" and that as owners of the land plaintiffs
in error were also owners of the waters percolating in the soil
thereof, and riparian owners, having the rights of riparian
proprietors in the waters of the river.
The trial court decided that the city was, and had been since
its organization, owner in fee simple of the paramount use of
the waters of the Los Angeles River, so far as might be needed
from time to time, for the public purposes of supplying the

HOOKER v. LOS ANGELES.
Opinion of the Court.

inhabitants of the city with water for public and domestic purposes, as described in the complaint; but plaintiffs in error
were the owners of the particular land, and had, subject to the
rights of the city, the rights of riparian proprietors thereof,
and the right to use the water of the river for all purposes for
which riparian owners are entitled to use such waters.
The contentions seem to be that the state courts decided
against the claim of plaintiffs in error to the rights of a riparian
owner, and to the ownership of alleged percolating waters, as
derived from patents of the United States as well as from Mexican grants, or under the treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo; that
the statutes of California in authorizing the trial of title in
condemnation proceedings, and the determination of compensation before the determination of title, amounted to providing
for the taking of private property for public use without just
compensation; that certain statutes declaring the city to be
vested with a paramount right to the surface and subterranean
waters deprived plaintiffs in error of their property without due
process of law ; and that the statute of the State in providing
that compensation and damages should be deemed to have accrued at the (late of the summons, as construed by the state
courts, resulted in taking the property of plaintiffs in error without just compensation.
Obviously, the question as to the title or right of plaintiffs in
error in the land, and whatever appertained thereto, was one of
state law and of general public law, on which the decision of
the state court was final. '8anFranciscov. Scott, 111 U. 5. 768;
Powder F rks v. Davis, 151 U. S. 389. And the question of
the existence of percolating water was merely a question of
fact.
The patents were in the nature of a quit claim, and under
the act of March 3, 1851, were "conclusive between the United
States and the said claimants only, and shall not affect the interests of third persons." The validity of that act was not
drawn in question in the state court, and as the right or title
asserted by plaintiffs in error was derived under Mexican and
Spanish grants, the decision of the state court on the claims
asserted by plaintiffs in error to the waters of the river was not

Opinion of the Court.

against any title or right claimed under the Constitution, or
any treaty, or statute of, or commission held, or authority exercised, under the Constitution. If the title of plaintiffs in
error were protected by the treaty, still the suit did not arise
thereunder, because the controversy in the state court did not
involve the construction of the treaty, but the validity of the
title of Mexican and Spanish grants prior to the treaty. JN'ei
Orleans v. De Armas, 9 Pet. 224; Iowa v. Rood, 187 U. S. 87;

In Crystal Springs Land and Mater Company v. City of Los
Angeles, 82 Fed. Rep. 114, the Circuit Court ruled that where
both parties claimed under M1exican grants, confirmed and patented by the United States in accordance with the provisions of
the treaty of Guadeloupe Iidalgo, and the controversy was
only as to what were the rights thus granted and confirmed,
the suit was not one arising under a treaty so as to confer jurisdiction on a Federal court, and that where the only ground of
Federal jurisdiction was the allegation in a bill that defendant's
claim of title was based in part on certain acts of the legislature
of the State, which attempted to transfer to it, as alleged, the
title held by complainant's grantors at the time of their passage,
the court would not retain jurisdiction when an answer was
filed by defendant denying the allegations, and disclaiming any
title or claim of title not held by it before the passage of the
acts. The bill was dismissed, and we affirmed the judgment.
177 U. S.169.
The trial court determined for itsblf, among other questions,
the nature and extent of the city's interest in the waters of the
river, but while it instructed the jury in relation thereto it did
not file its written findings until after the return of the verdict.
And it is argued that the respective rights of the parties were
not in fact adjudicated until after the amount of compensation
had been found, and that in this way plaintiffs in error were
deprived of their property without due process of law. The
Fourteenth Amendment does not control the power of a State
to determine the form of procedure by which legal rights may
be ascertained, if the method adopted gives reasonable notice
and affords a fair opportunity to be heard. Iowa Central .

HOOKER v. LOS ANGELES.
Opinion of the Court.

R. Co. v. Iowa, 160 U. S. 389; Long Island Mater Supply Com1)any v. Brooklyn, 166 U. S. 685.
The construction of a law of a State, that it was competent
for the court to try and determine in a condemnation proceeding, an adverse claim of the plaintiff therein to an interest in
property sought to be condemned, is conclusive on this court,
and we cannot understand how the entry of the verdict of a
jury as to the amount of compensation prior to the filing of
written findings on the other issues could have the effect of depriving plaintiffs in error of their property without due process
of law. The Chief Justice of California well said that it was of
no importance in what order the other issues in the case were
decided, except in so far as the determination of one point was
necessary as a basis for the determination of another, and that
if the instructions to the jury actually given were correct, the
fact that these findings had not been previously filed was of no
consequence.
And so as to certain statutes of the State of California, which
declared that the city of Los Angeles is vested with the paramount right to the surface and subterranean water of the Los
Angeles River. Those statutes were admitted in evidence
merely to show that the city was the successor of the ancient
pueblo. The court held that the right of the city of Los Angeles to take from the Los Angeles River all of the waters of
the river to the extent of its reasonable domestic and municipal
needs was based on the Spanish and iMexican law, and not on
the charters of the city of Los Angeles. The validity of the
statutes, on account of repugnancy to the Federal Constitution,
was not drawn in question in the trial court nor in the Supreme
Court of the State, and both courts held that they neither
granted to the city nor took away from plaintiffs in error any
rights or property.
Section 1249 of the Code of Civil Procedure of California
provided that for the purpose of assessing compensation and
damages, the right thereto should be taken to have accrued at
the time of the summons, "and its actual value at that date,
shall be the measure of compensation for all property to be
actually taken, and the basis of damages to property not actually
taken, but injuriously affected."

OCTOBER TERM, 1902.
Opinion of the Court.

The validity of the statute under the state constitution had
been repeatedly sustained by the state courts, and those courts
held that the value referred to in the statute was the actual
value at that date.
Plaintiffs in error asked the court to charge the jury that the
date of estimating the value of the property was the date of the
summons, and the Supreme Court held that in these circumstances they could not be permitted to attack the condemnation
statute as unconstitutional so far as related to the appraising
the value of the land as provided.
Moreover, this court cannot reverse the decisions of state
courts in regard to questions of general justice and equitable
considerations in the taking of property. .Fallbrooklrrigation
District v. Bradley, 16- U. S. 112.
The truth is there is nothing in this record adequately showing that the state courts were led to suppose that any claim
under the Constitution of the United States was made by plaintiffs in error, or that any ruling involved a decision against a
right set up by them under that instrument.
In ,ayward v. Denny, 158 U. S. 180, after stating the contention of plaintiff in error that the effect of the judgment of
the state court was "to deprive him of his property without
due process of law, or to deny him the equal protection of the
laws, and amounted to a decision adverse to the right, privilege,
or immunity of plaintiff in error under the Constitution of being protected from such deprivation or denial," we said: "But
it nowhere affirmatively appears from the record that such a
right was set up or claimed in the trial court when the demurrer
to the complaint was overruled, or evidence admitted or excluded, or instructions given or refused, or in the Supreme Court
in disposing of the rulings below.

.

.

.

We are not called

on to revise these views of the principles of general law considered applicable to the case in hand. It is enough that there
is nothing in the record to indicate that the state courts were
led to suppose that plaintiff in error claimed protection under
the Constitution of the United States from the several rulings,
or to suspect that each ruling as made involved a decision
against a right specially set up under that instrument. And

we may add that the decisions of state tribunals in respect of

the law of the land is violated unless their conclusions are absolutely free from error."

LOTTERY CASE.

APPEAL FROI

ThE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
NORTHIRN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 2. Argued December 15, 16, 1902.-Decided February 23, 1903.

Lotter~y tickets are subjects of traffic among those who choose to buy and
sell them and their carriage by independent carriers from one State to
another is therefore interstate commerce which Congress may prohibit
under its power to regulate commerce among the several States.
Legislation under that power may sometimes and properly assume the form,
or have the effect, of prohibition.
Legislation prohibiting the carriage of such tickets is not inconsistent with
any limitation or restriction imposed upon the exercise of the powers
granted to Congress.

THE general question arising upon this appeal involves the
constitutionality of the first section of the act of Congress of
March 2, 1895, c. 191, entitled "An act for the suppression of
lottery traffic through national and interstate commerce and
the postal service subject to the jurisdiction and laws of the
United States." 28 Stat. 963.
The appeal was from an order of the Circuit Court of the
United States for the Northern District of Illinois dismissing
a writ of h4abeas corpus sued out by the appellant Champion,
who in his application complained that he was restrained of his
liberty by the Marshal of the United States in violation of the
Constitution and laws of the United States.
