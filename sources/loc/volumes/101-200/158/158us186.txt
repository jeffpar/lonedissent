conclusive unless some collusion or fraud upon the part of the

did not tend to show any such fraud or collusion, and, if it
did, it was not competent under the pleadings. There was no
sufficient allegation of fraud or collusion on the part of the
sureties in the answer. Besides, we think the evidence disclosed a state of facts from which it could be fairly presumed
that defendant had notice of the pendency of the former suit."
We are not called on to revise these views of the principles

is enough that there' is nothing in the record to indicate that
the state courts were led to suppose that plaintiff in error
claimed protection under the Constitution of the United States
from the several rulings, or to suspect that each ruling as
made involved a decision against a right specially set up under
that instrument. And we may add that the decisions of state
tribunals in respect of matters of general law cannot be reviewed on the theory that the law of the land is violated

Statement of the Case.
case of collision, suffice to condemn the steamer, unless there be proof
that the failure contributed to the collision.
From the facts as stated by the court in the statement of facts and in the
opinion, it is held that there can be no doubt that the collision between
the Oregon and the Clan Mackenzie was attributable to the inefficiency
of the pilot and lookout of the Oregon.
Where one vessel, clearly shown to have been guilty of a fault adequate in
itself to account for a collision, seeks to impugn the management of the
other vessel, there is a presumption in favor of the latter, which can
only be rebutted by clear proof of a contributing fault, and this princil)le
is peculiarly applicable to a vessel at anchor, complying with regulations
concerning lights and receiving injuries through the fault of a steamer
in motion.
The provision in Rev. Stat. ยง 4234 that every sail vessel shall on the approach
of a steam vessel during the night time, show a lighted torch upon that
point or quarter to which the steam vessel shall be approaching, is no
part of the International Code, and would seem to apply only to American
vessels, and has no application to vessels at anchor.
Under all ordinary circumstances a vessel discharges her full duty and
obligation to another vessel by a faithful and literal observance of the
International rules.
The obligors in a stipulation given for the release of a vessel libelled for a
collision are not, in the absence of an express agreement to that effect,
responsible to intervenors in the suit, intervening after its release; but
the court below may treat their petitions as intervening libels, and issue
process thereon, or take such other proceedings as justice may require.

Tins suit was originally instituted December 31, 1889, by
the filing of a libel in admiralty by John Simpson, master of
the British ship Clan Mackenzie against the steamer Oregon,
to recover damages for a collision between the two vessels,
which occurred December 27th in the Columbia River about a
mile above a point in the river known as Coffin Rock light,
and resulted in the sinking of the Clan Mackenzie, and the
loss of two of her crew. The libel charged the Oregon with
fault in not having a proper lookout or a competent pilot, and
in failing to keep out of the way of the Clan Mackenzie,
which was then at anchor.
Upon the Oregon being arrested, a claim to her was interposed by the Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway
Company, and a stipulation given in the sum of $260,000 to
answer the libel. Subsequently, intervening petitions were
filed by James Laidlaw, administrator of the estates of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Statement of the Case.

two seamen of the ship who were killed in the collision, by
John Simpson and his wife individually, and by eighteen
others of the crew of the Clan Mackenzie for the loss of their
property,clothing, and effects in the sinking of the ship. Copies
of these petitions were served upon the claimant, but no warrant
of arrest was issued, and no separate stipulation was given to
answer the intervenors' demands.
James Joseph, another of the crew, also intervened, alleging
that he had been seriously injured by the collision, and asking
damages therefor. Exceptions to these petitions were filed,
denying the right to intervene after the vessel had been discharged from arrest. These exceptions were overruled, and
the claimant ordered to answer. Answers were accordingly
filed.
Subsequently, and on April 5, 1890, the Oregon Short Line
and Utah Northern Railway Company, charterer of the Oregon, filed a cross-libel against the Clan Mackenzie, charging
that the collision occurred through the fault of the latter, in
failing to display a proper anchor light, to keep a proper
anchor watch, or to call the steamer's attention by shouting,
ringing the ship's bell, or showing a lantern or torch, as required by Rev. Stat. ยง 4234. A stipulation was given in the
sum of $50,000 to answer this cross-libel, and the cases came
on to a hearing in the District Court upon libel and cross-libel.
The District Court found the Oregon to have been in fault
for excessive speed, for want of a proper lookout, and of an
officer on deck, and for the negligence of her pilot in mistaking the anchor light of the Clan Mackenzie for that of Coffin
Rock, and for not keeping farther out in -the channel of the
river. The District Court also found the Clan Mackenzie to
have been in fault for the want of a proper lookout, for
failure to ring her bell, and for the omission to exhibit a torch.
The ease was adjudged to be one of mutual fault, and a decree
was entered dividing the damnages. The intervening petitions
were held to have been properly filed, and one-half of their
claims was ordered to be paid by the Oregon, and the other
half out of the money found to be due to the Clan Mackenzie.

Statement of the Case.

the Circuit Court, which affirmed the decree of the District
Court, and made the finding of facts printed in the margin. 1
FINDING OF FACTS.

First. That the Clan Mackenzie is aBritish vessel of twenty-five hundred
tons burden, built of iron, two hundred and fifty-nine feet in length, thirtyeight feet beam, and twenty-three feet in the hold, and was early in the
forenoon of December twenty-sixth, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, at
Astoria, Oregon, bound for Portland from Rio Janeiro, in ballast, and in tow
of the steamboat Ocklahana, of which one Henry Empkins was master and
pilot.
Second. That about eight o'clock in the evening of said day said vessel
came to anchor on the Oregon side of the Colombia River in five fathoms of
water, at three feet flood tide and about nine hundred feet distant from and
a little below a dock and woodyard for steamboats called Neer City; also,
about three-fourths of a mile below Goble's Point and a mile above Collin
Rock.
Third. That immediately below said Coffin Rock and a short distance
inside of it, on the face of a wooded promontory and at a height of about
thirty feet from the water, there is and was at said time maintained a government light, described as a tubular-lens lantern of one hundred candle
power, with a radiating power of four miles, and easily visible on a dark,
clear night from three to four miles.
Fourth. That said steamboat Ocklahaina was owned at said date by the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, but was in possession and control
of said Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway Company under a
lease from said Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, and that said
Henry Empkins, as master and pilot, was the agentof the said Oregon Short
Line and Utah Northern Railway Company.
Fifth. That said pilot anchored the Clan Mackenzie on the edge of the
ship channel, which at that point is nearly half a mile wide at the mean of
the lowest low waters and well out of the usual track of the ocean steamers
that ply between Portland and San Francisco, and also back and out of the
range of said Coffin Rock light.
Sixth. That under the direction of said pilot there was placed in the fore
rigging of said Clan Mackenzie on the starboard side midway between the
foremast and the shrouds, between twenty and twenty-ive feet above the
deck and thirty-five to forty feet above the water, an anchor light, which
was a white light in a copper lantern with a globular corrugated lens over
eight inches in diameter, and that the material used in it was equal to the
best coal oil, and it would burn eight hours without trimming; that it was
easily visible on a dark, clear night a mile away and was kept in place and
burning brightly from ten o'clock i. r. of said December twenty-sixth up to
and at the moment of the collision hereinafter mentioned.
Seventh. That said pilot then proceeded with said Ocklahiama to the dock
of the woodyard at said Neer City, where said steamboat was tied op for
the night.

Mr. Artemas H. Jlolmes for the Oregon and the Railway
Company. Mr. W. W. Cotton, Mr. John F Dillon, and Mr.
J. i. Wilson were with hin on his brief.
Eighth. That said Clan Mackenzie was well and properly anchored, and
that the light hung in the rigging thereof was properly hung and was in all
respects a good and sufficient anchor light.
Ninth. That about nine o'clock in the evening of said December twentysixth, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, the Oregon, an iron steamship of
about one thousand tons burden and three hundred feet in length, and being
operated by said Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway Company
under the lease from the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company as
owner thereof, left Portland, Oregon, for San Francisco, California, with
a cargo of freight and passengers, under the charge of a pilot, and drawing
between sixteen and seventeen feet of water and having a proper mast
light and side lights burning.
Tenth. That the night of said December twenty-sixth, eighteen hundred
and eighty-nine, was dark and clear, the weather calm, with some clouds in
the sky; a few stars were visible, and according to the calendar the moon
set at 9.42 P.m.
Eleventh. That during the passage of the Oregon down the Columbia
River, and up to the time of the collision, the pilot thereof was on the centre
of the bridge just abaft and above the pilot-house, and there was a man at the
wheel and another forward on the forecastle head acting as a lookout. The
steersman and lookout came on duty at twelve o'clock, and besides these no
person connected with the vessel was on dnty on deck from that time to
the collision.
Twelfth. That near one o'clock, and a mile or more above Goble's Point
and opposite the railway ferry landing, the anchor light of the Clan Mackenzie and the Coffin Rock light might both have been seen from the ship's
channel in the Columbia River, and there the pilot of the Oregon saw one
light which he took for said Coffin Rock light.
Thirteenth. That from this point the Oregon followed the bend of the
river to the westward for nearly a half mile until both lights were shut out
by Goble's Point, and in time course of the next half mile she came back to
the northward, so that by the time she was abreast of the foot of Sand
Island and just above Goble's Point, if she had been in midehannel, both
lights would have been plainly visible from her deck, though somewhat in
line, the light of the Clan Mackenzie being the farther in shore; but the
Oregon, instead of being in midehannel, hugged the shore in the bend above
Goble's Point, and came abreast of said point on the south side of the
channel, when the pilot saw a light, which he supposed to be Coffin Rock
light, and headed for it, giving the steersman the course northwest by
north, which was held to the moment of the collision, while the general

direction of the ship channel from abreast of said Goble's Point to below
Coffin Rock light is north-northwest.
Fourteenth. That the light which the pilot saw both above, at, and below
Goble's Point and which he mistook for the Coffin Rock light, was in fact
tie anchor light of the Clan Mackenzie, but that the Coffin Rock light was
brning brightly during all said times, and should have been visible from
the deck of the Oregon.
Fifteenth. That during said time, and up to the moment of the collision,
the Oregon was going through the water at the rate of twelve miles an hour
and about fifteen miles past the land.
Sixteenth. That the Oregon arrived within three hundred feet of the
Clan Mackenzie when the pilot and lookout of the Oregon simultaneously
discovered the Clan Mackenzie, and the helm of the Oregon was immediately put to port.
Seventeenth. That the course of the Oregon was not changed in time
to avoid a collision, and she struck the Clan Mackenzie in a direction
slightly diagonal to her keel between the port cathead and the stem, and cut
into her for a distance of about thirty feet.
Eighteenth. That from the deck of the Oregon the outline of the shore
from Goble's Point to Coffin Rock was easily distinguishable, and the light
of the Clan Mackenzie should have been seen and distinguished for at least
a quarter of a mile.
Nineteenth. That it was and is the custom of vessels being towed from
Astoria to Portland to anchor for the whole or part of a night in the Colul)ia River, which fact should have been known to the persons in charge
of the Oregon, and they should have kept a good lookout for such vessels
in order to avoid a collisi6n.
Twentieth. That said collision was caused primarily by the fault of the
Oregon, in that she was being run at too high a rate of speed; that she did
not have a proper lookout on the bow; that she should have had at least
one officer on deck to oversee said lookout, and that her pilot was negligent
or incompetent in mistaking the anchor light of the Clan Mackenzie for that
of Coffin Rock light and in not keeping well out into the channel of the
river before rounding Goble's Point, so as to bring the Coffin Rock light
plainly in view before giving the steersman the course, and also in standing
continuously at the middle of the bridge over and above the light in the
pilot-house instead of moving back and forth thereon.
Twenty-first. That there was a watch on board the Clan Mackenzie, who
had instructions from the master to keep a good lookout and ring the bell
if the weather became thick or foggy, and that said watch saw the light of
the Oregon when about three-fourths of a mile away and her hull when at
a distance of about one-fourth of a mile, when he perceived that she was

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.
MR.

JUSTICE BRowN,

after stating the case, delivered the

opinion of the court.
At the time of the collision in question, which occurred
about one o'clock on the morning of December 27, 1889, the
ship Clan Mackenzie, an iron sailing vessel of 2500 tons burden,
bound from Rio Janeiro to Portland in ballast, was lying at
anchor in five fathoms of water on the westerly or Oregon
side of the Columbia River, about 900 feet distant from and
below a steamboat dock known as Neer City, about threequarters of a mile below Goble's Point, and one mile above
Coffin Rock. She was anchored on the edge of the ship channel, which, at that point, is nearly half a mile wide at low water,
and well out of the usual track of ocean steamers plying up
and down the river, and out of the range of Coffin Rock light.
She was provided with an anchor watch, and was displaying
the proper statutory anchor light between twenty and twentyfive feet above the deck. In this condition she was run into
and sunk by the steamship Oregon. The circumstances above
detailed raise a presumption of fault on the part of the Oregon,
and the burden of proof is upon her to exonerate herself from
heading directly for the Clan Mackenzie and commenced shouting and continued to do so until just before the collision, but he did not ring the bell.
The weather was not thick or foggy.
Twenty-second. That said Clan Mackenzie was not provided with a
torchlight to be shown on the approach of danger* and none was siown at
the time the Oregon was approaching.
I further find from the evidence now introduced in connection with that
introduced in tie District Court that it is not customary when a ship is at
anchor in a harbor, river, or channel, as in this case, with her anchor light
l)urning brightly, and the night is clear and without fo, to show a torch or
a flash light or ring a bell on the approach of a steamer, and that if a torch
or flash light is not already prepared and at hand and-ready for use that it
would take five minutes to obtain one from the place where they are usually
kept and light it.
Twenty-third. That said Clan Mackenzie, being a foreign vessel, was
not required, under section forty-two hundred and thirty-four of the Revised Statutes, to burn a torch on the approach of the Oregon, and it was
not the custom on the Columbia River to do so or to ring a bell in a clear
night under like circumstances, but tie liability to a collision would have
been greatly diminished hadi either been (lone in time.

Virginia 1nrman and The Agnese, 97 U. S. 309, 315; I
Parsons on Shipping, 573.
Has she succeeded in doing so?
An answer to this question requires the consideration, both of
her own movements, and of the alleged delinquencies on the
part of the Clan Mackenzie.
1. The Oregon was an iron steamship, 300 feet in length,
and of about 1000 tons burden, and was navigated by the
railway under a charter from her owner, the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company, in a freight and passenger trade
between Portland and San Francisco. She left Portland at
about nine o'clock in the evening in question with a cargo of
freight and passengers, under charge of a river pilot, drawing
about sixteen feet of water, and displaying her proper riding
lights. The weather was cal and the sky somewhat cloudy,
but the night was dark and clear - such a night as is most
favorable to the discovery of lights. The deck watch was
composed of' the river pilot in command, who was on the
bridge just above the pilot-house; a man at the wheel, and
a lookout upon the forecastle head. No officer and no other
man connected with the vessel was on deck from the time the
watch was changed at 12 o'clock until the collision.
Considering the darkness of the night, her rate of speed,
which was fifteen miles an hour past the land, the narrowness
of the channel, and the probability of meeting other vessels,
the greatest watchfulness was required, and we think that
prudence demanded at least an additional lookout. The watch
was the smallest that would be tolerated under any circumstances, and even were it sufficient for navigation by daylight,
it by no means follows that it was sufficient for running a
river in a dark night. It is hardly possible that, in a fourhour watch, the attention of the lookout should not be occasionally diverted front his immediate duty. Yet the withdrawal of his eye from the course of the vessel even for the
fraction of a minute may occur at a moment when a light
comes in sight, and before this light can be accurately located
and provided for, a collision may take place. As was said
by Mr. Justice Swayne in The Ariadne, 13 Wall. 475, 478:
VOL. CLVIII-13

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

"The duty of the lookout is of the highest importance. Upon
nothing else does the safety of those concerned so much depend. A moment's negligence on his part may involve the
loss of the vessel with all the property, and the lives of all
on board. The same consequences may result to the vessel
with which his shall collide. In the performance of his duty
the law requires indefatigable care and sleepless vigilance."
Where, as in this case, the circumstances are such as to
require more than ordinary care, we think it not too much to
require a lookout to be stationed on either bow. I[t was said
in the case of The Oydensburg (C/1amberlain v. Ward), 21
How. 548, 571, that ocean steamers usually have two lookouts
in addition to the officer of the deck, and that no less precaution should be taken by first-class steamers on the Lakes. In
the case of Tlie Germnania, 3 Mar. Law Cases (0. S.), 269, a
case of a steamer which had come into collision with a barque
in the English Channel in a dark night, the Privy Council
were advised by the nautical assessors, who assisted them,
that it was the usual practice in king's ships to have never
less than two lookouts at the bowsprit, and their lordships
announced themselves as not satisfied with the sufficiency of
the reason alleged for having only one lookout in that case.
While, in the case of The Colorado, 91 U. S. 692, the collision
took place during a dense fog, it was said, in the opinion of
the court, that a watch consisting only of the mate, one
wheelsman, and one lookout, besides the engineer, would
hardly be considered sufficient for a large propeller, even in
a clear night.
Nor are we satisfied with the conduct of the master in leaving the pilot in sole charge of the vessel. While the pilot
doubtless supersedes the master for the time being in the
command and navigation of the ship, and his orders must be
obeyed in all matters connected with her navigation, the master is not wholly absolved from his duties while the pilot is
on board, and may advise with him, and even displace him in
case he is intoxicated or manifestly incompetent. Ie is still
in command of the vessel, except so far as her navigation is
concerned, and bound to see that there is a sufficient watch on

deck, and that the men are attentive to their duties. The
fona, L. R. 1 P. C. 426.
In The Batavier, 1 Spinks, 378, 383, it was said by Dr.
Lushington : '.There are many cases in which I should hold
that, notwithstanding the pilot has charge, it is the duty of
the master to prevent accident, and not to abandon the vessel
entirely to the pilot; but that there are certain duties he has
to discharge (notwithstanding there is a pilot on board) for
the benefit of the owners." In an official report made by a
maritime commission in 1874, the Elder Brethren of Trinity
House are said to have expressed the opinion "that in wellconducted ships the master does not regard the presence of a
duly licensed pilot in compulsory pilot waters as freeing hin
from every obligation to attend to the safety of the vessel;
but that, while the master sees that his officers and crew duly
attend to the pilot's orders, he himself is bound to keep a
vigilant eye on the navigation of the vessel, and, when exceptional circumstances exist, not only to urge upon the pilot to
use every precaution, but to insist upon such being taken."
Marsden on Collisions.
These deficiencies in the watch, however, are rather evidences of negligence, and illustrative of lax management in
the navigation of the vessel than distinct faults in themselves,
and would not suffice to condemn the vessel in the absence of
evidence that they contributed to the collision. The question
still remains, what was the particular act or omission which
brought about the collision ?
At Goble's Point, three-quarters of a mile above where the
Clan Mackenzie lay, there is a bend in the channel; but the
anchor light of the ship, as well as Coffin Rock light, might
have been seen from the deck of the Oregon near the railway
ferry landing, a mile or more above Goble's Point. The pilot
did in fact see one of such lights, which he took to be Coffin
Rock light. As the steamer neared Goble's Point, however,
both lights were shut in by the land; but a little before
reaching the point, if she had been in midchannel, both lights
would have been plainly visible from her deck, though somewhat in line, that of the ship being a little nearer the bank.

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

But the Oregon, instead of being in midehannel, hugged the
shore in the bend above Goble's Point, and was on the southerly (more properly, the westerly) side of the channel as she
came abreast of the point, when the pilot saw a light, which
be supposed to be Coffin Rock light, and headed for it, giving
the wheelsman the course N. W. by N., which was held to the
moment of the collision, although the general direction of the
ship channel from a point abreast of Goble's Point is N. N.
W. (This finding is probably a mistake for N. W. by N. I N.)
The light which the pilot saw both above, at, and below
Goble's Point, and which he mistook for the Coffin Rock light,
was in fact the light of the Clan Mackenzie. But the Coffin
Rock light was burning brightly all this time, and should
have been visible from the deck of the Oregon.
The pilot did not in fact discover the Clan Mackenzie until
he was within 300 feet of her, when he and the lookout simultaneously made her out, and the wheel was immediately put
to port. The change of course, however, was too late to avoid
a collision, and the steamer struck the Clan Mackenzie in a
direction slightly diagonal to her keel, between the port cathead and the stem, and cut into her a distance of about thirty
feet. It is stated by the District Judge that the pilot sought
to excuse himself for seeing but one light, by suggesting that
the two lights must have been so near in line that a mast of
the Clan Mfackenzie intercepted the rays of the Coffin Rock
light. But, as the outline of the shore from Goble's Point to
Coffin Rock was easily distinguishable from the (leek of the
Oregon, it was manifestly owing to the negligence or inefficiency of the lookout, that the two lights were not separated
and distinguished, as the Oregon rounded Goble's Point.
Indeed, the finding of the Circuit Court is that both lights.
might have been seen at the railway ferry landing, a mile
above Goble's Point, and from the course of the river at and
below the landing, it is impossible that the two lights should
nlot have been distinguished before the steamer reached the
point; and, even after that, they could hardly have been so
constantly in line as not to be separated, if the lookout had
been attentive to his duty. In all probability, however, he

TIE OREGON.
Opinion of the Court.

was watching the Coffin Rock light, and gave no thought to
the possibility of there being another light between him and
Coffin Rock. From the fact that the Clan Mackenzie was
anchored on the westerly edge of the channel, and that as
soon as she was perceived, the order was given to port, it
would appear that the Oregon was considerably to the westward of her proper course, and that, instead of shaping her
course outside of Coffin Rock light, she was in reality heading
directly for the light of the Clan Mackenzie, which she mistook
for the other. The pilot should not have been taken unawares
by the presence of the ship, as there is a distinct finding that
it was the custom of vessels being towed from Astoria to
Portland to anchor for the whole or part of the night in the
Columbia River, and that this fact should have been known
to the persons in charge of the Oregon, and they should have
kept a good lookout for such vessels. Add to this the further
fact that the lookout of the Clan Mackenzie repeatedly hailed
the steamer, while she was yet a quarter of a mile away, and
that the Oregon neither distinguished her light nor heard
her hail, and the inattention or incompetency of the lookout
becomes even more clearly manifest. In short, there can be
no doubt whatever that this collision was attributable to the
inefficiency of the pilot and lookout of the Oregon.
2. The District Judge was also of opinion that the Clan
Mackenzie failed to discharge her whole obligation to the
steamer, and should consequently share the loss. In this
opinion the Circuit Judge, with evident hesitation, concurred. As we had occasion to remark in T/e City of New
)Tork, 147 U. S. 72, 85, where one vessel clearly shown to
have been guilty of a fault, adequate in itself to account for
the collision, seeks to impugn the management of the other
vessel, there is a presumption in favor of the latter, which
can only be rebutted by clear proof of a contributing fault.
This principle is peculiarly applicable to the case of a vessel
at anchor, since there is not only a presumption in her favor,
by the fact of her being at anchor, but a presumption of fault
on the part of the other vessel, which shifts the burden of
proof upon the latter.

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

So far as concerns the management of the Clan Mackenzie,
the facts found are that her anchor watch was charged by
the master to keep a good lookout, and ring the bell if the
weather became thick or foggy; that the watchman saw the
light of the Oregon about three-quarters of a mile away, and
her hull when at a distance of about one-quarter of a mile,
when he perceived that she was heading directly for the Clan
Mackenzie, and commenced shouting, and continued to do so
until just before the collision, but did not ring the bell; that
the Clan Mackenzie was not provided with a torchlight, to be
shown on the approach of danger, and none was shown at the
time the Oregon was approaching.
Upon these facts the Clan Mackenzie was found to have
been in fault, first, in not providing her anchor watch with a
torchlight or flare-up, whereby her presence might have been
indicated to the approaching steamer; and, second, because
her anchor watch (lid not avail himself of the means at hand
for this purpose, to wit, the ship's bell. The International
Code, (Rev. Stat. ยง 4233,) in force at this time, provided, (rule
ten,) that " all vessels, whether steam-vessels or sail-vessels,
when at anchor in roadsteads or fairways, shall, between
sunset and sunrise, exhibit, where it can best be seen, but at
a height not exceeding twenty feet above the hull, a white
light in a globular lantern of eight inches in diameter, and so
constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light,
visible all round the horizon, and at a distance of at least one
mile."
This rule was substantially, if not literally, complied with.
The light was of the regulation size, and if it were hung a
little over twenty feet above the hull, the difference was cntirely immaterial, as it is found to have been seen by the
pilot of the Oregon, though mistaken for the Coffin Rock
light.
The obligation to exhibit a torch is claimed to arise directly
from Revised Statutes, sec. 4234, which provides that "collectors, or other chief officers of the customs, shall require all
sail-vessels to be furnished with proper signal lights, and
every such vessel shall, on the approach of any steam-vessel

THE OREGON.
Opinion of the Court.

during the night-time, show a lighted torch upon that point
or quarter to which such steam-vessel shall be approaching."
This section was incorporated into the Revised Statutes from
an act passed February 28, 1871, c. 100, 16 Stat. 440, and is
strictly no part of the International Code, which was originally adopted in 1864. This act is entitled " An act to
provide for the better security of life on board of vessels
propelled in whole or in part by steam, and for other purposes." Its first section enacts: "That no license, register,
or enrolment shall be granted, or other papers issued, by
any collector or other chief officer of the customs, to any
vessel propelled in whole or in part by steam, until he shall
have satisfactory evidence that all the provisions of this act
have been fully complied with." The act then proceeds to
lay down certain requirements, designed for the protection
of life upon steam vessels, and obviously intended to apply
only to American vessels. The seventieth section contains
the provision in question, subsequently incorporated into the
Revised Statutes as ยง 4234. Indeed, the forty-first section
of the act expressly provides that it "shall not apply to
public vessels of the United States, or to vessels of other
countries." Even if this section (Rev. Stat. ยง 4234) stood
alone and unexplained by the other provisions of the act of
which it was a part, it would seem to apply only to American vessels, since Congregs could hardly have intended to
make it the duty of collectors to require foreiga sail vessels
to be furnished with proper signal lights, even if it had the
power to do so.
But, even admitting that ยง 4234 was intended to cover
foreign vessels, we think it has no application to vessels at
anchor, but was designed to supply an obvious deficiency in
the International Code, with respect to vessels under way.
By rule 8 of the original code of 1864, sailing vessels under way
were required to carry colored lights visible at a distance of
two miles, but so enclosed by inboard screens that they were
wholly invisible to vessels coming up astern or approaching
from either side, unless such approach were from a direction
not more than two points abaft the beam. In other words,

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

one or the other of such colored lights was visible over an arc
of the horizon of twenty points of the compass; but no provision was made for the exhibition of a light to a steamer
coming up within the unilluminated arc of twelve points; and,
in a dark night, of course there was great danger of collision,
since the code provided that "no other" lights than those
mentioned in its rules should be carried. Even if a steamer
approached from ahead, the colored lights were frequently so
dim as to escape observation, and the exhibition of a torch was
a very proper additional precaution.
No such argument, however, applies to the case of vessels at
anchor, which were required by rule 10 (Art. 8 of the Revised
Code of 1885) to exhibit a large white light so constructed
as to be visible all around the horizon, and at a distance of at
least a mile.
If a proper lookout be kept upon the approaching steamer, this is an adequate provision for a clear night, and
the, additional requirement of exhibiting a torch might impose
upon the vessel anchored in a stream'where steamers are constantly passing and repassing the duty of keeping a torch
burning the entire night. Suppose, for instance, the vessel
were anchored in New York Bay or in the lower part of the
tLudson River, in ordinary weather there probably would not
be a moment during the whole night when a steamer might
not be said to be approaching her, within the meaning of the
section, and if she were required to exhibit a torch to every
such steamer, she would be required to keep one burning practically all the time. That would not only be wholly unnecessary, but liable to lead to great confusion and annoyance to
palssing steamers. The very fact that the section applies only
to sailing vessels indicates that it refers to sailing vessels under
way, since there is just as much reason for requiring a steamer
to exhibit a torchlight at anchor as a sailing vessel, as the
light displayed by both is the same. Indeed, it is at least
open to question whether this provision, so far as it applies
to the high seas, was not repealed by article 11 of the act of
March 3, 1885, c. 354, 23 Stat. 438, 440, which requires that "a
ship which is being overtaken by another shall show from
her stern to such last-mentioned ship a white light or

flare-up light." The failure of the International Code to
make some provision for notice to vessels coming up astern of
another was so manifestly a casus ornissus that, even before
the adoption of the Revised Code, it was held that the leading
vessel was bound to exhibit a light astern. This position was
treated as a "special circumstance," requiring the use of extraordinary precautions. The John Fenwick, L. R. 3 Ad. &
Ec. 500 ; Thie Anglo-Indian, 3 Asp. Mar. Law Cas. 1; The

It is insisted, however, that, irrespective of the statute, the
Clan Mackenzie was bound to make use of every precaution
which the exigencies of the case called for, to avert a collision;
that she had no right to rely upon her statutory light, but was
bound either to exhibit a torch, ring a bell, or in some other
.equally efficient manner call the steamer's attention to the fact
of her presence in the river. Undoubtedly, where the circum:stances of the case are such as to demand unusual care, such care
should be exercised. Indeed, there is a special provision in
rule 21 that "in construing and obeying these rules due regard
must be had to all dangers of navigation, and to any special
circumstances which may exist in any particular case rendering a departure from them necessary in order to avoid immediate danger."
The code, however, is supposed to make
provision for all ordinary cases.
It originated in the English Merchant Shipping Act Amendment Act of 1862, the twenty-fifth section of which provided
for the adoption by Order in Council of certain rules and
regulations for preventing collisions at sea; requiring the
adoption of certain lights, fog signals, and steering and sailing rules adapted to ahnost every case. These regulations
were adopted in lotidem verbis by the act of Congress of April
29, 1864, Rev. Stat. ยง 4233, and by all the leading maritime
nations of the world ; and in the case of The Scotia, 14 Wall.
170, were held by this court to have become the general law
of the sea, and obligatory upon all nations which had given
their assent to them. In the subsequent case of The Belgenland, 114 U. S. 355, 370, they were said to be binding upon
foreign as well as domestic ships, unless the contrary were

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

made to appear. In 1880, a new system, not differing radically from the former one, was adopted in England; and by
the act of March 3, 1885, 23 'Stat. 438, c. 354, became the law
in this country so far as concerned vessels navigating the high
seas. The object of this code was to establish a uniform
system of rules and regulations, which should be obligatory
throughout the world, taking the place of the various and
somewhat conflicting usages which had theretofore obtained
among maritime nations. As before stated, they are regarded
as sufficient protection for a vessel under ordinary circumstances ; and one vessel meeting another, whether of the same
or different nationality, has a right to assume that both are
governed by the same laws, and each may regulate her own
conduct accordingly. Exceptions to these rules, though provided for by rule 24, should be admitted with great caution,
and only when imperatively required by the special circumstances or the case. It follows that, under all ordinary circumstances, a vessel discharges her full duty and obligation
to another by a faithful and literal observance of these rules.
The power to superadd to them other requirements involves
the power to determine what shall be superadded, and in this
particular there is room for a great and embarrassing diversity
of opinion. Thus, one court might hold that, in addition to
displaying the regulation light, a vessel at anchor should
swing a torch; another, that she should ring a bell; another,
that she should blow a horn, beat a drum, or fire a cannon,
and the result would be that a lookout would never know
when he had performed his full duty to an approaching vessel.
In the answer in this case it is averred that the lookout on the
ship "did nothing to attract the attention of those on board
said steamer, either by shouting, ringing said. bell, or swinging
a lantern or a torch, or otherwise; that if said lookout had
shouted, or had rung said bell, or had swung a lantern or
torch upon the approach of said steamer, the said night being
still and dark as aforesaid, said collision would have been
avoided." The proof showing, however, that the lookout
did, in fact, hail the steamer, the respondent is forced to
abandon this position, and claim that he should have rung
his bell or swung his lantern or torch.

THE OREGON.
Opinion of the Court.

If courts were at liberty to add to the requirements of the
statute, it would always be claimed that the signal added
was not the proper signal that should have been used. Undoubtedly, if there be fog, or thick weather, a vessel at
anchor is bound by rule 15 to ring a bell; but, in an ordinary
clear night, with no immediate danger impending, we think
a proper anchor light supplies every needful precaution. And
while in Tle Jlerhcant Prince, 10 P. D. 139, it was held
that the exhibition of a flare-up light was not forbidden by
article 2 of the Revised Code requiring that certain lights, and
no others, should be carried; yet we are aware of no case holding that a vessel at anchor in a clear night is bound to do more
than display her anchor light until danger of collision is
imminent. It is true that article 24 of the Revised Code
provides that nothing shall exonerate a ship from the consequences of the neglect of any precaution which may be
required by the ordinary practices of seamen, or by the
special circumstances of the case. But in this case there is
a distinct finding that it is not customary when a ship is at
anchor in a harbor, river, or channel, as in this case, with her
anchor light burning brightly, and the night is clear and without fog, to show a torch or flash light, or ring a bell on the
approach of a steamer. Under such circumstances the Clan
Mackenzie cannot be charged with the neglect of any custom
or "ordinary practice" to exhibit a torch or ring a bell.
In measuring her duty under the circumstances of this case,
it must be borne in mind that her lookout had no reason whatever to apprehend danger, until the Oregon had rounded
Goble's Point, and taken her course for Coffin Rock. She was
then about three-quarters of a mile distant, and at her rate of
speed of fifteen miles an hour, (a mile in four minutes,) woul
cover this distance in three minutes. Even then he had a
right to assume that she would take the usual course down
the centre of the channel, would see his light, and give it a
proper berth. Ie certainly was not bound to presume that
she would be guilty of the gross and almost incomprehensible
negligence of turning from her proper course and running
directly down upon him, and until it became manifest that she

had not observed his light, he was not called upon to act. It
was then too late to light a torch, if he had had one at hand,
or perhaps even to ring a bell, and in view of the finding of
the Circuit Court that, if a torch or flash light is not already
prepared and at hand and ready for use, it would take five
minutes to obtain one from the place where they are usually
kept and light it, we are unable to understand how the court
could have held the Clan Mackenzie liable for the non-exhibition of a torch, unless upon the theory that it was her duty to
keep one lighted all the time. As soon as the lookout became
satisfied that the Oregon either had not seen or had mistaken
his light, lie did what in the excitement of the moment seemed
to him best. He hailed her, and continued to shout until just
before the collision. It was a case of action in extremnis, and,
while it is possible that a bell might have called the attention
of the approaching steamer, it is by no means certain that it
would have done so, and whether the lookout acted wisely
or not, he evidently acted upon his best judgment; and the
judgment of a competent sailor in extremis cannot be impugned. Indeed, we are not prepared to say that a hail
could not have been heard as far as a bell, and considering
the character of the lookout that was kept on the Oregon, it
is very doubtful whether a bell would have been heard or
regarded. As we have already observed, it is not sufficient
for the Oregon to cast a doubt upon the management of the
Clan Mackenzie. In view of the clearness of her own fault,
it is not unreasonable to require that she should make the
fault of the other equally clear. This she has fallen far short
,of doing.
It is also argued with great insistence that the anchor light
of the Clan Mackenzie was lowered when the Oregon first
came in sight, and that such fault was the primary and sole
cause of the collision. We have examined the testimony
upon that point, which is slight, and are therefore of the opinion that the court was amply justified in refusing to make this
finding.
Although this collision occurred in 1889, we have assumed
that the original Code of 1864 applied to it, in view of the

THE OREGON.
Opinion of the Court.

exception in section 2 of the Revised Code " as to the navigation of such vessels within the harbors, lakes, and inland
waters of the United States." The question is immaterial,
however, since the provisions of the Codes of 1864 and 1885
are substantially identical as to the requirements involved in
this case, and we do not, therefore, find it necessary to express
a decided opinion upon the point. Our conclusion is that the
Oregon was solely in fault.
3. The courts below were also in error in entertaining jurisdiction of the intervening petitions. These petitions were filed
after a stipulation had been given for the release of the Oregon, upon the original libel of Simpson, to recover for the loss
of the Clan Mackenzie. No new warrant of arrest was issued
upon these petitions, but the claimant, the Oregon Short Line
and Utah Northern Railway Company, was ordered to answer
them, and, in the final decree, damages were awarded to the
intervening petitioners, and the claimant ordered to pay into
court the sum of $35,531.19, to be applied, first, to the payment of the intervenors, and then to the payment of the original libel. We are unable to understand upon what theory
this apportionment was made.
The stipulation given for the release of the Oregon was as
follows
"Whereas a libel was filed in this court on December 31,
1889, by John Simpson against the steamer Oregon, her
tackle, apparel, and furniture, for the reasons and causes in
said libel mentioned, and praying that the same may be condemned and sold to answer the prayer of said libellant, and a
claim has been filed by the Oregon Short Line & Utah Northern R'y Co. and the said claimant and W. S. Ladd and Van
B. De Lashmutt, sureties, the parties hereto, hereby consenting and agreeing that in case of default or contumacy on the
part of the claimant or its sureties execution may issue against
their goods, chattels, and lands for the sum of two hundred
and sixty thousand dollars: Now, therefore, it is hereby stipulated and agreed, for the benefit of whom it may concern,
that the stipulators undersigned shall be and are bound in the
sum of two hundred and sixty thousand dollars, conditioned

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

that the claimant above named shall abide by and pay the
money awarded by the final decree rendered in the cause by
this court, or, in case of appeal, by the appellate court."
Here is a simple agreement to become responsible for the
final decree rendered in the cause in which the stipulation is
given, and the words "for the benefit of whom it may concern" refer undoubtedly to the owners of the Clan Mackenzie, in whose behalf Simpson, the master, had filed the libel.
We know of no authority which permits the liability of sureties upon such a stipulation to be enlarged by the inclusion of
-claims other than the ones which the stipulators agree to pay.
To such a claim the surety may well reply non in hecfoedera
veni. The stipulators may be so well satisfied that the claimant has a defence to the original libel as to be willing to take
upon themselves the contingency of a decree requiring its payment, but they may neither know, nor be able to conjecture,
what other demands may be made against the property.
In the case of The Palmnyr, 12 Wheat. 1, 10, in which this
court held that it had power to reinstate a prize cause after
dismissal, the general liability of sureties upon a stipulation is
thus stated by Mr. Justice Story: "Whenever a stipulation
is taken in an admiralty suit, for the property subjected to
legal process and condemnation, the stipulation is deemed a
mere substitute for the thing itself, and the stipulators liable
to the exercise of all those authorities on the part of the court,
which it could properly exercise if the thing itself were still in
its custody. This is the known course of the admiralty. It
is quite a different question whether the court will, in particular cases, exercise its authority where sureties on the stipulation may be affected injuriously ; that is a question addressed
to its sound discretion."
In Nwell v. Norton, 3 Wall. 257, the libellant originally
proceeded against the vessel, the master and owner, and the
pilot for a collision. The libel was subsequently amended, by
leave of the court, by dismissing it as to the pilot, and sustaining it as against the vessel and her master or owner. This
amendment was held to have been properly granted, inasmuch
as it appeared that the liability of the sureties was neither

Opinion of the Court.

increased nor diminished by it. And in this connection the
court quoted the familiar doctrine that "every person bailing
such property is considered as holding it subject to all legal
dispositions of the court." There was no intimation, however,
that the liability of the sureties could be increased by the
insertion of additional claims.
On the other hand, in the case of T4e North Carolina,15
Pet. 40, appealed from the Court of Appeals of the Territory
of Florida, a libel for salvage was filed originally against
seventy-two bales of cotton. One Houseman appeared as
claimant, and gave a stipulation for its agreed value. The
Superior Court of the Territory decreed restitution of the
seventy-two bales. Houseman appealed to the Court of Appeals of the Territory, where the libellant proceeded for one
hundred and twenty-two bales taken in salvage, charged that
it was forcibly and wrongfully taken, and claimed damages
for the marine tort. The Court of Appeals sustained this
claim for the whole amount, and made a personal decree
against Hlouseman beyond the sum for which the stipulation
was taken. This was held to be error, the court saying that
in so far as the seventy-two bales were concerned, either party
was authorized to make amendments, or introduce new evidence, in order to support his title in the appellate court.
But the libellant could not introduce a new subject of controversy, by bringing into the case the additional fifty bales,
or make a decree against the claimant inpersonam.
Nearer in point, and almost exactly analogous in principle,
is the case of Tlie Nied Elwin, I Dodson, 50. This vessel,
sailing under Danish colors, was captured by a privateer, and
subsequently restored, by consent, to the owners. A claim was
interposed for the cargo by a firm in Copenhagen, to whom
the judge restored four-sevenths, and ordered further proof
,of the remainder. Bail was given to the captor in double the
appraised value of the latter, and subsequently the judge pronounced the goods to be Danish property, and apparently
,ordered it to be returned to the owners. The King's advocate
then moved for the condemnation of the property to the
Crown in consequence of hostilities since declared between

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

England and Denmark, and also for a monition against the
bail to answer the adjudication.
HIe argued that the bail bond should be considered as a substitute for the thing itself ; that it was not confined to the
captor, to whom it was given, but was to answer all questions
relative to the property, which might arise before the ultimate
adjudication of the cause; that the Crown must be considered
as identified with the captor, and that, in case of property condemned to the Crown, instead of the captor, by whom the proceedings were originally instituted, the responsibility of the
bail was indisputable.
Sir William Scott, (afterwards Lord Stowell,) in delivering
judgment, said that the question was whether the persons who
had given bail were subject to the demands of the Crown to
account for the value of the goods. At the time the property
was delivered on bail, the question was whether it belonged
to subjects of Denmark. If so, the claimant would be entitled
to restitution. The court announced that it could not entirely
concede to the position that these bonds were mere personal
securities, given to the individual captors, but they were
regarded as pledges or substitutes for the thing itself, "in all
points fairly in adjudication before the court." " But," said
he, "the question still recurs, has the Crown the right to
enforce payment from these parties in the event, which has
since occurred, of Danish hostilities ? I am of opinion that it
has no such right.

...

The court does, indeed, upon the

intervention of hostilities accept the old proceedings, and upon
them pronounce for the interest of the Crown; but it does
so merely for the purpose of saving time and expense, and not
with any view of fixing a responsibility upon those who have
given bail to answer a very different question. If the court
were to accede to the prayer of the Crown upon this occasion
the effect would be monstrous ; it would extinguish altogether
the practice of delivering property upon bail, a mode so much
encouraged by the court and by the legislature. No British
merchant would become security for foreign claimants in any
ease, if he should be considered responsible to the extent of
such a possible contingenee as that of a subsequent intervention
of hostilities."

THE OREGON.
Opinion of the Court.

The gist of this opinion is that, if the change in the case
had been merely that of substituting the Crown for the
original captors, the bail would have been responsible, but
that the subsequent intervention of hostilities so far changed
the original cause of action as to exonerate the bail. In other
words, the contract of a surety, whether at common law or
in admiralty, is one strictissimijuris, and cannot be changed
by implication. While the bail is intended as a substitute for
the property itself, it is only such, as stated by Sir William
Scott, " in all points fairly in adjudication before the court."
In the case of Tlie Saracen, 2 W. Rob. 451, 457; S. C. 4
Notes of Cases, 498, 507, a contest arose between differentparties injured by a collision over the proceeds of the sale of
the libelled vessel. In delivering his opinion with respect to
certain questions of practice which arose in the case, Dr. Lushington observed : "In concluding my remarks upon this part
of the case, I may here observe, that if bail had been given
in the present instance, such bail, I apprehend, would have
been responsible only to the plaintiffs in the action which they
had bailed. It could not, I conceive, for a moment be contended that the claimants bringing the subsequent action
would have any title to recover against such bail, or to participate in any fund which they might bring into the registry
of the court in discharge of their liabilities as bail." A simnilar observation was made by the same eminent judge in the
subsequent case of Tle Clara, Swabey 1, 4. See also Tie
Williamn, Hlal, Lush. 25.
The case of The T IF. Snook, 51 Fed. Rep. 244, is exactly
in point. In this case a vessel was arrested for damages done
to another vessel by a collision, and was released upon bond.
Afterwards an insurance company intervened, claiming that
the cargo of the libellant vessel had been insured by the company, and had been totally destroyed by the collision. A
decree was rendered condemning the respondent vessel. Ield,
that the insurance company should not be allowed to be lot
in to share in the decree to the extent of what might remain
of the penalty of the bond after satisfying the decree in regard
to the damage to the other vessel, since the bond was given

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

only to satisfy the cause of action sued for in the original
libel. The case of the Oregon was cited, but Judge Blodgett
held it to be inapplicable to the facts of that case. We find
it impossible to distinguish this case from the one under consideration. It was quoted with approval at the last term of
this court in the case of T7e JIaytican Republic, 154 U. S.
118, 127, in which a vessel libelled for smuggling, and discharged upon giving the bond required by law, was held to be
subject to a libel in another district for another offence alleged
to have been committed prior to the offence charged in the
first libel.
The District Judge, in his opinion upon exceptions to certain of these petitions, quotes general admiralty rule 34 as
authority for the proposition that, if third parties intervene
in any admiralty case, the other party or parties in the suit
may be required, by order of the court, to make due answer.
This is entirely true, but the rule has reference only to those
cases where the vessel is still in custody, or where she has
been sold and the proceeds of sale paid into court. If still in
custody when intervening petitions are filed, the vessel cannot
be released until a stipulation is given to answer all the libels
on file. But if, after the stipulation is given, and the vessel
is discharged from custody, other libels are filed, a new warrant of arrest must be issued, and the vessel again taken into
custody.
We think the court must have confounded a stipulation
given to answer a particular libel with a stipulation for the
appraised value of the vessel, under the limited liability act,
which, by general admiralty rule 54, is given for payment
of such value into court whenever the same shall be ordered,
and in such case the court issues a monition against all persons
claiming damages against the vessel, to appear and make due
proof of their respective claims. And by rule 55, after such
claims are proven and reported, "the moneys paid, or secured
to be paid into court as aforesaid, or the proceeds of said ship
shall be divided pro rata
or vessel and freight . .
amongst the several claimants, in proportion to the amount
of their respective claims." By rule 57, if the ship has been

THE OREGON.
Opinion of the Court.

already libelled and sold, the proceeds shall represent the
same for the purpose of these rules. In all the cases cited, in
which it has been said that the stipulation is a substitute for
the thing itself, the remark has been made either with reference
to the particular suit in which the stipulation is given, or with
reference to a stipulation for the appraised value of the vessel,
where the stipulation stands as security for any claim which
may be filed against her up to the amount of the stipulation.
Thus in Tle P~almyra, 12 Wheat. 1, it was held that the
court possessed the power to reinstate any case dismissed by
mistake upon the ground that the stipulators were liable to
the exercise of all those authorities upon the part of the
court, which it could properly exercise, if the thing itself were
still in its custody. See also Tle Ann Caroline, 2 Wall. 538;
Tie lVanata,95 U. S. 600, 611 ; Te Mebb, 14 Wall. 406 ; United
States v. Ames, 99 U. S. 35 ; Thie Union, 4 Blatchford, 90.
The injustice of holding the sureties in this particular case
liable to the intervenors is the more manifest from the decree
that was entered requiring their claims to be paid before that
of the principal libellant. If it so happened that the sureties
were unable to respond to the full amount of their stipulation,
or to an amount sufficient to pay all the claims, the result
would be that the intervenors, who had taken no steps to
arrest the vessel, and were admitted under the original libel
of Simpson, might be able to appropriate to themselves the
whole or the greater part of the fund, and leave the original
libellant wholly unprovided for. A proposition which would
bring about this result surely cannot be a sound one.
The decree of the Circuit Court must, therefore, be
Reversed, with costs to the original libellants as against the
steamship Oregon, and with costs to the Oregon as against
the intervenors,and the case remanded to the Circuit Court
for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion ;
without prejudice, however, to the right of the court below,
or of the District Court, in its dis retion, to treat the intervening petitions as independent libels, and to issueprooess tereon against the steamship Oregon, her owners or
charterers, or to take such otherproceedings therein asjustice may require.
