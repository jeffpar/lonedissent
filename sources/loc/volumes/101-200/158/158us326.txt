UNION PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY v. HARRIS.
ERROR

TO

THE

CIRCUIT

COURT

OF

APPEALS

FOR

THE

EIGHTH

CIRCUIT.
No. 896.

Submitted April 15, 1895. -

Decided May 20, 1895.

Writs of error to Circuit Courts of Appeals in actions for damages for
negligence of railroad coporations are allowed when the corporations
are chartered under the laws of the United States.
In an action against a railway company to recover for injuries caused by
a collision with a car loaded with coal for a coal company which had
escaped from the side track and run upon the main track, it is held, in
view of the evidence, to be no error to charge that the railway company
is bound to keep its track clear from obstructions, and to see that the
cars which it uses on side tracks are secured in place, so that they will
not come upon the track to overthrow any train that may come along.
When in such an action the defendant sets up a written release of all claims
for damages signed by plaintiff, and the plaintiff, not denying its execution,
sets up that it was signed by him in ignorance of its contents, at a time
when he was under great suffering from his injuries, and in a state approaching to unconsciousness, caused by his injuries and by the use of
morphine, the question is one for the jury, under proper instructions
from the court; and in this case the instructions were proper.

Tins was an action brought in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Colorado by Robert E.
Harris against the Union Pacific Railway Company to recover for personal injuries received by him while he was a
passenger on defendant's train. Plaintiff recovered judgment
in the Circuit Court and the defendant sued out a writ of error
from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, by
which the judgment was affirmed. 63 Fed. Rep. 800. A
writ of error from this court was allowed and the cause
having been docketed, motions to dismiss or affirm were
submitted.
Mr. George G. Vest for the motions.

UNION PACIFIC RAILWAY v. HARRIS.
Opinion of the Court.

The complaint alleged Harris to be "a citizen of the State
of Colorado," and complained of "the Union Pacific Railway
Company, defendant, which was heretofore and now is duly
chartered and organized under and by virtue of the laws of
the United States, and having its principal place of business
in the city of Omaha and State of Nebraska, and is now and
was at the time and times hereinafter stated, a citizen of the
State of Nebraska." The motion to dismiss is made upon the
ground that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals
was final, inasmuch as the jurisdiction was dependent upon
the opposite parties being citizens of different States. As,
however, the judgments of the Circuit Courts of Appeals are
final in this class of cases only when the jurisdiction is dependent "entirely upon the opposite parties to the suit or controversy, being aliens and citizens of the United States or citizens
of different States," plaintiff in error insists that this judgment
was not final, since the jurisdiction depended not solely on
diverse citizenship, but also upon the fact that plaintiff in
error was a Federal corporation.
In Nort/er Pacific ]ailroadCompany v. Amato, 144 U. S.
465, a suit was brought in the Supreme Court of New York
against the railroad company to recover damages for personal
injuries sustained by the plaintiff, and was removed by the
defendant into the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of New York on the ground that it arose
under an act of Congress in that the defendant was a corporation created thereby, and a writ of error to the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit was sustained. In that
case the citizenship of the plaintiff was not mentioned in the
complaint or in the petition for removal, and the petition
stated that the action arose under an act of Congress. It was
accordingly held that the judgment of the Circuit Court of
Appeals was not made final by section 6 of the judiciary act
of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826. In the present case
jurisdiction was invoked on the ground of diverse citizenship,
and it is said that that was the sole ground, and that the
reference to the authority under which the corporation was
chartered and organized was merely incidental, and, further,

Opinion of the Court.

that as the case did not involve the validity or construction of
the charter of plaintiff in error, no Federal question arose.

It is not for us to inquire why writs of error to Circuit Courts
of Appeals in actions for damages for negligence of railroad
corporations should be allowed simply because the corporations are chartered under the laws of the United States, in
a statute whose object was to relieve an overburdened court,
since such is the effect of the statute according to its plain
language. Nevertheless, as plaintiff below appears to have
really proceeded on the ground of diverse citizenship, we
think there was color for the motion to dismiss although, as
the other fact upon which jurisdiction could be predicated
existed, we are obliged to overrule it. But this brings us to
the motion to affirm, which, as we do not need further argument, we proceed to dispose of.
The complaint alleged that plaintiff on July 30, 1892, was
a passenger for hire upon one of defendant's coaches in a train
with a locomotive, being operated and conducted by defendant between the city of Georgetown and the city of Denver,
defendant being by the terms of the contract of passage
bound to deliver plaintiff safely at Denver, and having undertaken to carry and convey him in safety to that city, and to
use due care and diligence thereabout; but that defendant, in
disregard of its undertaking and promise and its duty in that
behalf, carelessly and negligently ran one or more of its
freight cars out on one of its sidings, known as Silver Age
Mill siding, and negligently left the same insecure and unsafe,
and in such a position and condition as to interfere with the
passage of the train of cars, upon which plaintiff had passage,
along the main line of defendant's track, so that when the
train upon which plaintiff was a passenger came along it ran
,into this freight car and the injuries complained of were
inflicted. This was supported by the evidence, from which it
also appeared that the freight car in question was loaded for
the Silver Age Mill Company with coal and was unloaded by
that company's men.
The defendant in its answer denied all negligence, but admitted "that it had standing upon its side track, at about the

UNION PACIFIC RAILWAY v. HARRIS.
Opinion of the Court.

place mentioned in said complaint, one or more freight cars;
but denies that the said freight cars were left insecure or
unsafe, or in such a position as to interfere with the passage
of the train of cars upon which this plaintiff was riding." The
answer contained no allegation or suggestiox that any other
company had any control over the side track or the freight
cars, or that any other company was in any manner responsible for the negligence which resulted in the collision.
The Circuit Court charged the jury that "there is no room
for controversy, notwithstanding the' fact that this car was
delivered to the mining company filled with coal, and for the
use of the mining company, and that it would seem from the
.evidence that after unloading the car, it was not sufficiently
fastened in respect of the brakes; perhaps it was necessary to
block the wheels also in such a place as that; but that whatever was necessary to keep it securely in place upon the side
track was not done, and it moved down upon the track so as
to overthrow the cars in the train which came down with the
plaintiff. The act of negligence of the servants of the mining
company is to be ascribed to the defendant. In other words,
the railway company as to its passengers is bound to keep its
track clear from obstructions of this kind; to see that the cars
which it uses on side tracks are secured in place so that they
will not come upon the track to overthrow any train that
may come along; and there seems to be no question but that
the car in which plaintiff was riding was overthrown by the
freight car coming down from the switch or side track and on
to the main track in collision with the cars of the train which
carried the plaintiff."
To the giving of these instructions defendant excepted.
But we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that on the
evidence and under the pleadings there was no reversible error
therein ; and that this is so as to the motion at the conclusion
of the evidence by defendant for an instruction that the defendant was not liable, and that the Silver Age Milling Company was, if there were a liability at all. Indeed, it is stated
by the Circuit Court of Appeals that it was conceded on argument that defendant's negligence was sufficiently established.

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

The stress of the contention of the railroad company is
thrown, however, upon another branch of the case. The
complaint was filed November 26, 1892, and the answer January 11, 1893. On July 8, 1893, the defendant below filed a
supplemental answer setting up a written release in bar of the
action, executed four days after the accident, to which supplemental answer a replication was filed July 11, 1893, averring
as ground of avoidance of such release that plaintiff's mind at
the time of its execution was so enfeebled by opiates, shock,
and pain that he was unable to enter into contractual relations;
that the minds of the parties never met on the principal subject
embraced in the release, namely, the damages for which the
action was brought; and that the release was obtained through
misrepresentation and fraud. The trial commenced July 14,
and was concluded, by the rendition of the verdict, on July
17, 1893. Upon the issues joined, the validity of the release
was a matter to be left to the jury. And although the bill of
exceptions does not purport to contain all the evidence, it
appears therefrom that there was evidence tending to sustain
the replication. Certain exceptions were taken by plaintiff in
error in relation to the admission of evidence over objection,
and these were dismissed by the Circuit Court of Appeals with
this observation: "A separate statement and consideration of
these exceptions is not necessary as none of them is of any
general importance. They have all been considered carefully,
and we are satisfied none of them has any merit." We are
of the same opinion, but will refer by way of illustration to
two of the rulings complained of. One of the questions in
the case was whether Harris was bound to have read the
release at the time he signed it, and that involved considering
whether he was able to do so. He was asked upon the trial
whether he could read any part of the release without spectacles, it being contended that be did not have his spectacles
at the time the claim agent of the railroad company interviewed him in his bed just after the accident. The witness
testified that he could not read the fine print with spectacles
nor the large print without; that his eyesight was not as good
as it was when the release was presented to him; but that

Opinion of the Court.

at that time he could not have read a word of it without his
glasses. Again he was asked: "Were you at the time of
signing that conscious that you were signing any agreement
other than for your expenses of sickness and loss of time for
two weeks?" and he answered: "That is what he told me;
that is just what he told me;" and that the release was
not read to him by the claim agent. We do not think that
any ruling in reference to this testimony can be held as
substantially incorrect. The word "conscious" related to
the understanding of the witness at the time, and the question and answer are to be taken with the other testimony
and the instructions in the case; and we find nothing in these
particulars calculated to mislead the jury or to be so prejudicial to the defendant as to justify complaint.
The railway company moved that the jury be instructed
that upon the evidence the release was a complete bar to the
action, which instruction the court declined to give and defendant excepted; but, as there was evidence tending to
sustain plaintiff's contention in relation to the validity of
the release, the instruction was properly refused. The court
charged the jury in this regard in substance as follows: "A
release of this kind is of the highest significance in general
when it appears that the situation and circumstances of the
parties show that it has been entered into with an understanding of the rights of the parties respectively, and with intent
to include all matters of difference between them " and "that
when the parties are upon an equal footing, and there seems
to be no reason to believe that any mistake has been made in
respect to it, that neither party is at liberty to deny the force
and effect of what it may contain; he is not at liberty to
say that he did not read it or that he did not understand it;"
but that "when it appears that either party is in a situation as
to his health, physical condition, or as to the state of his mind
that makes it probable that he acted without deliberation, without an understanding of the act with which he is charged, the
instrument itself may be disregarded ;" that in this instance,
plaintiff having been injured July 30, and, while he was lying
in bed apparently quite ill, " was approached by an agent of

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

the defendant company and was induced to sign the release,
which has been put in evidence before you;" and upon that
"it becomes a question in the first instance whether he was in
a condition to know precisely what he was doing. He seems
to have had in some degree and to some extent the possession
of his faculties; he had used whiskey at the time of the accident or shortly afterwards, and morphine had been administered to him on several occasions. There is a question as to
the effect of the accident, how far he was disabled by it, and
as to the effect of the drug and of the whiskey, perhaps, on his
mind; whether he was then in a condition to deal with such
a subject as was presented to him. If he was not, and you
can say that his faculties were in such a state that he could
not comprehend what he was doing, and the force and effect
of the paper which he signed, you may say he is not to be
charged with it;" "and aside from that, if there was a misunderstanding of the facts, whether the facts were wilfully
misstated by the agent of the railway company or not is not
a very material question; but the question is whether the facts
were understood by both parties ;" that upon that the agent
to the railroad company said "that he only spoke in a general
way of making a settlement," and "his language was such as to
comprehend all matters that were in difference between them,
while plaintiff says that he was not asked to consider nor did
he consider the question of the liability of the railroad company to him for the injury which he had received;" and. "that
in reckoning up what should be paid to him, they considered
only the question in respect to his illness, his doctor's bill and
the like, and the loss of time for two weeks;" and if the jury
accepted "plaintiff's account of the negotiation between them
as against that of the agent of the railway company, then it
would appear that the plaintiff, at least, did not understand
the subject-matter of the negotiation, and as to what is expressed in the release he says that he did not read it and could
not read it without his spectacles, and that he did not have
them at the time this paper was given to him."
The court further instructed the jury that " under some
,circumstances a man in full health and accustomed to the

UNION PACIFIC RAILWAY v. HARRIS.
Opinion of the Court.

transaction of business executing such a paper as that, would
not be at liberty to deny his knowledge of its contents; but
with one in the situation of plaintiff, lying on his bed and
somewhat prostrated by the shock which occurred at the time
of the accident, he may be excused from reading it if he did
not in fact read it ; " " he may be excused because he was in
some pain, misery, and perhaps, to some extent under the
influence of the morphine which he had taken;" and further
that "if he understood what he was doing and understood
that hie was making a settlement of the whole business, the
entire matter between himself and the railroad company, then
he is bound by the settlement without regard 'to the amount
of money which he received.
.
.
If the settlement was,
made with a full understanding of the rights of the parties,
the plaintiff then being in a state-of health to enable him to
transact such business, and upon that you say that the settlement is binding upon the plaintiff, he is concluded of this
action, and you need make no further inquiry in respect of it;
that is to say, his action cannot be maintained." And the
court further charged the jury that if they made an allowance
to the plaintiff they should deduct from it what he had
received.
To various parts of the charge defendant excepted, but we
deem it unnecessary to go over these exceptions in detail, as
the charge as a whole was in accordance with the great weight
of authority upon the subject, and was correct upon the issues
joined and the evidence thereon. Chicago, Rock Island &
