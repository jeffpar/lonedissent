CLARK v. REEDER.
APPEAL

FROM

THE

CIRCUIT

COURT

OF

THE DISTRICT OF WEST
No. 262.

THE

UNITED

STATES

FOR

VIRGINIA.

Argued April 22, 23, 1895. -Decided

May 27, 1895.

C. contracted in writing in 1884 with R. to purchase from him about 50,000
acres of land in West Virginia, which had been originally granted by
the Commonwealth of Virginia to 1). in 1796, and which I. had acquired in 1870 from persons who had purchased it at a sale for non-payment of taxes, made in 1857, after the death of D. The contract was
by the acre, at so much per acre. The title was to be examined by F.,
a lawyer of West Virginia, the attorney of C., and upon his certifying it
to be good the first payments were to be made. The total number of
acres within the defined limits were agreed to by both parties, but a
further survey was to be made at the expense of C., in order to ascertain
what tracts and how many acres within those limits were held adversely
to B. under a possessory title. F. certified that the title was good, except as to sundry small tracts held adversely, and C. thereupon made
the first payment under the contract. Partial surveys having been made,
C. declined to carry out his agreements, and filed a bill in equity, setting
up that there had been mutual mistakes as to the amount of the conflicting claims, and praying for a rescission of the contract. This bill was met
by an answer denying that there had been such mistakes, and by a crossbill. After sundry other pleadings, and after some evidence was taken,
C. filed an amendment charging fraud upon R. and his agent, and setting
up that the contract had been induced by fraudulent concealments and
representations on their part. Further proof was taken, and a hearing
below resulted in a decree in favor of R. In this court, after a careful
review of the pleadings and proof, it is fIeld, That the Circuit Court was
right in concluding that C. was not entitled to a rescission of the contract.
APRIL 16, 1796, a grant was made by the State of Virginia
to Edward Dillon for 50,096 acres of land situated in what
was then the county of Mlontgomery, but, at the time of the
transactions involved in this case, partly in the counties of
Wyoming, Boone, Raleigh, and Logan. The entry for the
land was made April 23, 1795, it was surveyed Mv[ay 28, 1795,
and the land was known and spoken of as the Dillon survey
or grant. In 1855, Dillon having died some time before, the
land was sold for taxes and charges thereon, and at that sale

was purchased by Lawson and Ward, to whom a deed was
made December 22, 1857, by the clerk of the county court of
Wyoming County, under the statute. Lawson and Ward subsequently conveyed the land to Simpson, who conveyed to
Cox, by whom it was conveyed to Charles Reeder in 1870,
who was and always has been a citizen and resident of Maryland.
In 1873 Reeder caused a survey to be made of the Dillon
tract by W. T. Sarver, a surveyor. At that time Reeder
ascertained that there were a number of persons actually living upon portions of the land embraced in the Dillon survey,
who claimed title to the land in their possession adverse to
Rleeder's title; the number of acres claimed by each being
comparatively small. C. C. Watts of West Virginia bad been
acting as attorney and agent for Reeder in matters connected
with the land for some years, when, on January 23, 1884, he
obtained from Reeder an option to purchase it at the rate of
two dollars per acre at any time before July 1, 1884. February 4, 1884, the previous agreement was modified so that if
$25,000 was paid to Reeder in cash within thirty days from
February 4, 1884, and an additional $1000 to reimburse him
for certain outlays made by him, then the price of the land
should be reduced from $2 to $1.50 per acre.
In the same month of January, Bell, acting as the agent of
Clark, who was a resident of the city of Philadelphia, had entered into negotiations with Watts for the purchase of the land,
in the profits of which purchase, if any, Bell and others were
interested. These negotiations were commenced in Philadelphia, and resumed in West Virginia in February, 1884, and as
a result thereof the following written contract was entered
into on February 29, 1884, between Watts and Bell:
"Agreement made this 29th day of February, 1884, by and
between C. C. Watts, of Charleston, W. Va., acting under an
agreement in writing between himself and Charles Reeder, of
Baltimore, Md., dated the 3d day of February, 1884, and as
the agent of said Reeder, of the first part, and I. M. Bell, of
Staunton, Va., acting as the agent of E. W. Clark, of Philadelphia, Pa., of the second part, witnesseth:

CLARK v. REEDER.
Statement of the Case.

"That the party of the first part, acting as aforesaid, has
this day sold to the party of the second part, acting as aforesaid, a certain tract or parcel of land lying and being in the
counties of Boone, Logan, Wyoming, and Raleigh, in the State
of W. Va., containing 50,096 acres, be the same more or less,
which tract of land was granted by the Commonwealth of Virginia to Edward Dillon by patent bearing date on the 16th day
of April, 1796, and is now claimed and owned by the said
Charles Reeder by a regular chain of conveyances, the first
being a tax deed for said land executed by the clerk of Wyoming County court to Evermont Ward and Anthony Lawson,
bearing date the 22d day of December, 1857, executed, in pursuance of a sale thereof for taxes delinquent thereon in the
name of the heirs of Edward Dillon, and the last to the said
Reeder from C. C. Cox, dated the 27th day of August, 1870,
and for a particular description of said tract of land reference
is had to said patent; upon the following terms and conditions,
to wit:
"First. Said sale of said land is a sale by the acre and not
in gross.
"Second. The party of the second part is to pay for the
said land at the rate of one dollar and seventy cents per acre,
as follows: Thirty-five thousand dollars to be paid on the day'
on which James H. Ferguson, a practising attorney of Charleston, W. Va., shall certify the title of said Reeder to said land
to be good and valid, which certificate is to be made within
30 days from this date; twenty-five thousand dollars of which
sum is to be paid to the said Reeder, and the residue to said
Watts. The balance of the said purchase money is to be paid
to said Reeder on the 1st day of June, 1881, or as soon thereafter as the necessary surveying can be done to ascertain the
quantity of land within the bounds of the said patent to which
the said Reeder can make good title. It is understood that
the party of the second part is satisfied with the survey already
made by.Wm. T. Sarver of the exterior bounds of said tract
of land, and that the surveying to be done is only such as may
become necessary to ascertain what lands within said boundary

are held by a better title than that of the said iReeder, by reason of adverse title and possession, all of which surveying is
to be done at the expense of said party of second part.
" Third. When the last of the purchase money is paid, the
said Reeder is to convey said land with covenants of special
warranty to the said E. W. Clark, or to such person or persons
as he may direct.
"Fourth. The balance of said purchase money, after the
date of the certificate of said Ferguson, is to bear interest
until paid.
"Fifth. In addition to said one -7o dollars per acre, the
party of the second part is to pay to said Reeder one
thousand dollars as provided for in his contract with said
Watts.
" Sixth. This contract is subject to the approval of said
Reeder, and is to take effect from the date of such approval,
but the same shall then be void if the certificate of said Ferguson is not made within the time specified.

REEDER."

If the conditions of the agreement of February 4, 1884, (the
date is given in the foregoing contract as February 3,) were
not fulfilled, then the only option Watts had was under his
agreement with iReeder of January 23, 1884, by which the
price was to be $2 per acre, and by the terms of the agreement
between Watts and Bell, Ferguson had thirty days from February 29, 1884, within which to pass upon the validity of the
title, before the lapse of which time the option from Reeder
to Watts to purchase at $1.50 per acre would have expired.
The contract price in the contract of February 29 was fixed at
$1.70 per acre, and the contract provided that $10,000, that is,
twenty cents an acre on the basis of fifty thousand acres, of

CLARK v. IREEDER.

Statement of the Case.

the purchase money should be paid to Watts, and if the contract was approved by Reeder, the time for the payment of
the $25,000, as provided by the option of February 4, would
be extended. The contract of February 29, 1884, was taken
to Baltimore by Watts and Bell, and on March 4, 1884, Reeder
endorsed his approval thereon.
Ferguson drew the contract of February 29, 1884, as the
attorney of Clark, and, acting under it, prepared and delivered
a written opinion and certificate, dated March 22, 1884, as
follows:
"Abstract of title to the following tract of land known as
the Dillon survey.
"1st.
"The Commonwealth of Virginia
to

Edward Dillon.
"Grant or patent for fifty thousand and ninety-six acres,
situate in the then county of Montgomery, Virginia, but now
principally in the counties of Boone, Raleigh, and Wyoming,
in the State of West Virginia, dated April 16, 1796.
"The grantee, Edward Dillon, died some time previous to
the year 1855, (it is not known just how long,) and the tract
of land was entered on the land books of Wyoming County,
where most of the tract is situated, in the name of Edward
Dillon's heirs and charged with taxes in that name.
"The taxes so charged on said tract not being paid the land
was returned delinquent, as required by law, for the non-payment of said taxes, and the same was sold as required by law
in the year 1855 for the said taxes and the charges thereon
and the costs of sale, at which sale Anthony Lawson and
Evermont Ward became the purchasers of the entire tract of
50,096, and the owners of said tract of land failing to redeem
the same within the time required by law the said Lawson
and Ward obtained a deed therefor under the statute.

"Leroy B. Chambers, clerk of the county court of
Wyoming County,

I

to
Anthony Lawson and Evermont Ward.
"Deed bearing date the 22d day of December, 1857.
"This deed conveys to the said Lawson and Ward, the purchasers of said tract of land at said tax sale, the said tract of
land and all the right, title, and interest of the heirs-at-law of
Edward Dillon, dec'd, therein, but said deed is defective, and
is not sufficient of itself to convey a good title to said tract of
land to the grantees therein. It is, however, a good and sufficient color of title to ripen into a good and perfect title by
possession of the land thereunder and the payment of the
taxes thereon for a sufficient length of time.
"I have made a full and thorough examination and investigation of the matters pertaining to the title to this tract of
land and find that as early as the years 1859 and 1860 the
said Evermont Ward, acting for himself and said Lawson,
placed tenants on said land under an agreement that said
tenants should clear and cultivate as much thereof as they
saw proper, and at such place or places thereon as they saw
fit, and that they should guard and protect the whole of the
said tract against trespassers, and that said tenants and others
put on said tract of land by and under them have continued
on said land as the tenants of said Lawson and Ward from
that time to the year 1870, when Charles Reeder became the
purchaser of said land, and from that time to this they have
held and occupied the said land as the tenants of said Reeder,
and still so hold and occupy the same. I also find that quite
a number of other persons have held and occupied said land
as tenants of Ward and Lawson and of said Reeder for more
than ten consecutive years, some of them going back to 1864,
and are still holding and occupying the same as the tenants of
said Reeder.
"The said Reeder has paid all the taxes charged and chargeable on said tract of land from the date of his said purchase

Statement of the Case.

thereof to the present time and has proper receipts therefor,
and there are now no unpaid taxes on said land."
[The third muniment was a power of attorney, Ward to
Lawson; the fourth, a deed from Lawson and wife and Ward
to Simpson; the fifth, a deed from Simpson to Cox; the sixth,
a deed from Cox and wife to Reeder dated August 27, 1870.]
"The deed of Chambers, clerk, to Lawson and Ward, of
Lawson and wife and Ward to Simpson, of Simpson to Cox,
and of Cox to Reeder are all of record in the office of the
clerk of the county court of Wyoming County.
"There are no recorded liens of any sort on said tract of
land in any of the counties in which the same is situate, and
the said tract of land, so far as the records show, is free and
clear of all incumbrances.
"The only title which can be found older than the Dillon
patent is a grant from the Commonwealth of Virginia to Rutter
and Etting, dated the 9th day of January, 1796. There is, from
the best information I can obtain, a small portion of the
Rutter and Etting survey embraced within the Dillon survey,
but the Rutter and Etting survey was forfeited long prior to
1837, to the State of Virginia for the non-payment of the
taxes thereon and for the non-entry thereof on the land books
of the proper county, and was sold by the commissioner of
delinquent and forfeited lands some forty or more years ago.
At the time of that sale the taxes on the Dillon survey had
always been paid, and for that reason the title to the whole
thereof became good and valid, so far as the Rutter and Etting
survey is concerned.
"In the year 1877 an act was passed by the legislature of
the State requiring all tracts of land of - acres or more lying
in different counties to be assessed for county and district taxation in the several counties and districts in which they were
situate, and under this law, in the year 1880, the said tract
was for the first time charged with taxes in the counties of
Boone and Wyoming, as follows: 9000 acres in the county of
Boone and the whole tract in the county of Wyoming, and the
taxes were paid thereon as charged by said Reeder. In the
year 1881 and since said tract of land was charged with taxes

Statement of the Case.

in the counties of Boone, Raleigh, and Wyoming as follows:
9000 acres in Boone, 5000 acres in Raleigh, and 41,096 acres in
Wyoming, making in all 55,096, and said Reeder has paid the
taxes so charged on that number of acres from that time to
the present.
"There are, so far as I can ascertain without actually going
over the whole tract, some 50 persons living on said tract, in
part as tenants of said Reeder and in part as claimants of portions of said land. Just what number of acres these claimants
can make out a good title to it is, of course, impossible to tell,
but I can say with almost a positive certainty that in view of
the possession of the said tract by said Reeder and those under
whom he claims for nearly 25 years the number of acres to
which these junior claimants can make title will be but small
comparatively.
"I do therefore certify that in my opinion the title of
Charles Reeder to the said Dillon survey is good and valid,
except as to such parts of said tract as may be affected by the
claims of the occupants aforesaid, which may or may not be
superior to the title of said Reeder."
This certificate having been delivered March 25, 1884, to
Bell, the agent of Clark, the former drew two drafts on the
latter at the city of Philadelphia, one for $10,000 in favor of
Watts, and the other for $25,000 in favor of Reeder, and
delivered them to Watts, who deposited and dashed his draft
on that day, and forwarded the draft for $25,000 to Reeder.
Both drafts were paid by Clark, and Ferguson's certificate
was sent to him.
The record shows that a surveyor, M. A. Miller, was employed in the spring of 1884 for the purpose of ascertaining
what number of acres within the exterior boundaries of the
Dillon tract were held by persons who were in the actual
possession thereof, claiming to hold them by title adverse to
Reeder, but no report of the result of his survey was made to
Reeder until some time in November, 1884. In this report
Miller said : "There are a large number of small tracts, held
under junior patents, lying within the Dillon survey, aggregating, approximately, 2500 acres. Most of these, perhaps all,

CLARK v. REEDER.
Statement of the Case.

are held by occupant claimants who have had them in undisturbed, continuous possession, under their junior patent titles,
for many years."
Reeder testified that: "This general statement of persons
holding better title by reason of adverse title and possession is
the only information looking to a compliance with that clause
of the contract which relates to surveying that has been furnished to me by E. W. Clark or his agents, but no survey or
exact determination, as the contract requires, has ever been
furnished me." The report of Miller was dated October 29,
1884, and in it he set forth that a large part of the land embraced in the Dillon survey was embraced in the land covered
by the grant made by the State of Virginia to Rutter and
Etting, January 9, 1796, on an entry made by William Duval,
May 13, 1795, for whom it was surveyed May 30, 1795. The
report also contained the names of parties in possession, who
claimed, or were supposed to claim, the title to portions of the
land embraced within the interlock of the two surveys, under
the Rutter and Etting title.
In the spring of 1885 Reeder applied to Clark to comply
with the terms of the contract of February 29, 1884, which
Clark declined to do.
August 1, 1885, Clark filed his bill of complaint in the Circuit Court of Boone County, West Virginia, against Reeder,
which was subsequently removed on iReeder's application to
the United States court for the District of West Virginia.
The bill alleged that at the time the agreement of February
29, 1884, was entered into, it was understood and believed by
all the parties that the title of Reeder to much the greater
part the land was good and valid, and that not more thanten thousand acres could be held by others than Reeder by
any other claim or title whatever, and that it was with this
understanding that complainant made the purchase and paid
the $35,000; that upon a survey it was found to the great
surprise of Clark that the entire Dillon survey, with the
exception of about 5000 acres, was within the outlines of the
Rutter and Etting patent; that the Rutter and Etting tract
was claimed by a large number of persons asserting their title
VOL. CLviii-33

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Statement of the Case.

to be superior to the title of leeder, and that complainant
could not safely pay any more of the purchase money under
the contract while the cloud thus created hung over the title
to the land ; that he had unsuccessfully endeavored to settle
with Reeder; that he had offered to bring actions of ejectment against those claiming under the Rutter and Etting title
in Reeder's name, and had asked Reeder to do so, but without
avail; and that Reeder required him to pay for the whole
number of acres after deducting the number of acres held by
actual settlers, amounting to some five or six thousand acres,
and to take the risk of the Rutter and Etting title, which he,
complainant, had refused to do; that the contract was entered
into by complainant without any knowledge of the conflict
created by the Rutter and Etting patent, and that he believed
Reeder was equally ignorant of any such conflict, and that the
agreement was therefore the result of mutual mistake as to
conflicting claims to the land which was the subject of the
agreement; that he would not have entered into the agreement
had he known of the existence of the conflict of title, at least
until all questions as to such conflict had been settled and
determined; and that he would not have paid the $35,000, or
any part thereof, until such settlement; that Reeder derived
his title mediately through a tax sale of the Dillon land, and
there was a question as to the validity of the tax deed and the
subsequent claim under it, and it was this claim that Ferguson
was appointed to report on, it being understood by both parties
that if this title was declared by Ferguson to be good, there
was nothing in the smaller surveys aforesaid to interfere with
the title of Reeder to the whole Dillon tract; hence it was
stipulated in the agreement that Reeder was to convey the
land to complainant with covenants of special warranty, complainant taking the risk of the Dillon title held by Reeder;
that by reason of the older and apparently the better title
complainant could not make his purchase available; and as he
could not bring ejeetment and Reeder would not, and especially in view of the mutual mistake before mentioned, complainant prayed a rescission of the contract and a repayment
of the $35,000.

CLARK v. REEDER.
Statement of the Case.

To this bill Reeder filed an answer and a cross-bill. The
answer denied that when the agreement of February 29, 1884,
was entered into there was any understanding other than or
different from that embodied in the agreement itself, or that
there was any understanding between the parties as to what
number of acres might be held by others than Reeder, or
what number might be excluded under the agreement. The
claim of right of any person, under the Rutter and Etting
patent was denied, and it was averred that any title which
might have once existed under that grant was long since forfeited, and it was further averred that complainant was advised to this effect in the certificate of opinion; and it was
denied that the fact that there were persons who claimed
under the Rutter and Etting title constituted any cloud on
the title to the land purchased by complainant from defendant, or furnished any excuse for complainant's neglecting to
carry out his contract. Defendant further averred that the
contract of February 29, 1884, was entered into by himself
and complainant with full knowledge that the whole question
of title was to be passed on by Ferguson, complainant's selected
attorney, before the money should be paid and before the contract should take any practical effect, and that one of the
matters considered by the attorney and reported on by him
was the supposed conflict of the Rutter and Etting patent with
the Dillon patent, and this was before complainant paid any
money under the contract ; that complainant's agent was apprised of the supposed conflict, and that the Rutter and Etting
patent had long since been forfeited. Defendant denied that
it was the validity of his tax title that Ferguson was ordered
to report on, but on the whole title; and declared that ample
time was given by the agreement for the examination of all
matters connected with the title, and if the examination did
not show the title to be good, the agreement was to be null
and void. Defendant admitted that he had refused to bring
or authorized to be brought in his name any actions for ejectment against persons claiming title to the land, not only because this was no part of the agreement, but because, before
the agreement was entered into, the agent of the complainant

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Statement of the Case.

was distinctly informed that defendant would not agree to
bring any action of ejectment against any persons in possession of or claiming title to any portion of the land, and was
distinctly informed before the agreement was entered into
that defendant would convey the land with a covenant of
special warranty only, the agreement expressly so providing.
Defendant further stated that though he had demanded of
complainant that lie should ascertain by survey the number of
acres within the boundaries of the Dillon tract, held by better
title than that of Reeder by reason of adverse title and possession, complainant bad altogether refused and failed to comply
therewith; and defendant averred thereupon that he was entitled to have the land sold under the decree of the court for the
payment of the purchase money. Defendant also denied that
there was any mutual mistake in the execution of the contract.
The cross-bill averred that at the time the agreement of
February 29, 1884, was executed, there were certain persons
in possession of some portions of the land embraced within the
boundaries of the Dillon tract, claiming title thereto under
junior claims, and these persons, irrespective of the validity of
their claims, Reeder was unwilling to disturb, and therefore
the provision was inserted in the agreement that surveys
should be made at the expense of Clark to ascertain the number of acres within the outlines of the tract which were held
by a better title than that of Reeder by reason of adverse
title and possession; and the cross-bill, after averring that
Reeder had waited for more than a year before demanding
payment of the balance of the purchase money, the amount
of which could not be known until the survey had been
made, yet that Clark had altogether refused and failed to
furnish Reeder a list of the persons holding lands within the
boundaries of the tract by better title than Reeder by reason of adverse possession and title, and had refused to pay
the balance of the purchase money, alleging as a reason that
claims were set up to some portions of the land, but not
pretending that any person making such claim had better
title than Reeder by reason of "adverse title and possession," prayed that a decree might be passed for a sale of the

CLARK v. REEDER.
Statement of the Case.

land for the payment of the unpaid balance of the purchase
money.
This cross-bill was filed May 5, 1886, and on May 14 Clark
filed an amended and supplemental bill to the effect that one
Rockey was cutting timber on a part of the land and should
be restrained ; and also that actions of ejectment should be
brought against persons in possession of the land claiming
adversely to Reeder; and asking for the.appointment of a
receiver or receivers. Before this bill was actually filed, the
court directed an injunction against Reeder and appointed a
receiver with directions to bring such suits as he should be
advised to bring by counsel for Reeder or Clark against all
persons holding or claiming to hold adversely to Reeder. On
July 28, 1886, Reeder filed his answer to this supplemental and
amended bill, objecting to the appointment of a receiver and
moving for his discharge. Rockey also answered the bill
and filed a number of exhibits with his answer. November
13, 1886, Clark filed his answer to the cross-bill of Reeder,
restating the matters set forth in the original bill, and relying
on them and the knowledge that the facts revealed by the
Miller survey as to the Rutter and Etting title had been known
to Reeder.
On December 4, 1886, Watts, who had been in the mean,
time made a party, filed his answer to the original and amended
and supplemental bills of Clark, setting up substantially the
same matters and things as those set forth in Reeder's answer
and cross-bill, and also stating all the facts and circumstances
,connected with the making of the agreement of February 29,
1884, the furnishing of the certificate of opinion of Ferguson,
and the payment of the $35,000 on March 25, 1884. Watts
averred that during the negotiations between Clark's agent
and himself leading up to the making of the contract, the
fact of an interlock between the Dillon survey and the Rutter
and Etting survey was made known by him to Clark's agent,
though not knowing the extent of the interlock he did not
state it ; and he also said on the occasion of the payment of
the $35,000 on March 25, 1884, the fact of this interlock was
again the subject of conversation, and Clark's agent said that

OCTOBER

Statement of the Case.

in view of Ferguson's opinion this was immaterial. On February 19, 1887, Clark filed a second amended and supplemental
bill, stating, in addition to the reiteration of the allegations of
the original bill, that neither at the time of the execution of the
contract or its approval by Reeder did Clark, his agent, or
Ferguson, his counsel, know that there was any interlock between the Dillon and Rutter and Etting surveys, nor was any
intimation given thereof by Reeder or Watts ; that it was
not until after the signing and approval of the contract and
after an examination and investigation by Ferguson of the
claims of the junior claimants and occupants and of the possession of the land by Reeder and by Ward and Lawson, his
predecessors in the ownership thereof, that anything was said
by Watts about the Rutter and Etting patent or its interference with the Dillon survey, and that when he did speak of it
he spoke of it as a small and unimportant interference which
would not seriously affect the land sold to Clark; that though
Ferguson had for many years been acquainted with the Dillon
survey and had always regarded it as good and valid and the
title unquestionable, and had long known of the Rutter and
Etting survey, and the sale thereof as forfeited for delinquent
taxes by proceedings for the purpose, yet that le had never
heard that the Rutter and Etting survey covered any portion
of the Dillon survey, and the fact only came to his knowledge after the approval of the agreement of February 29, 1884,
and after the examination and investigation aforesaid he, as
far as was possible, looked into the matter and was satisfied
that if there were any interference it was so small and unimportant as not seriously to impair the value of the Dillon survey even if it should prove a better title, and that in this belief
he gave the information and opinion in regard to it, to be
found in his certificate; that before the agreement was reduced to writing the whole matter was fully discussed, and it
was the distinct understanding of Bell and Ferguson and of
Watts, as they understood him, that the Dillon patent was
the oldest patent covering all embraced within it, and that
there would not be any adverse claim set up to any of the
land except some junior grantee of some parts of the land,

CLARK v. REEDER.
Statement of the Case.

which holdings would not exceed 5000 acres, and probably
not be more than 2500, the quantity when ascertained to be
deducted from the 50,096 acres, and it was to ascertain the
number of acres so held that the survey mentioned in the
agreement was provided for. This bill propounded certain
interrogatories to Reeder and to Watts, as to their knowledge
of thQ interference and its extent, and called for answers under oath. It was further averred that when the original bill
was filed it was with the belief by Clark that Watts and
Reeder were altogether ignorant when the contract wvas executed that the iRutter and Etting survey interfered with the
Dillon survey, and therefore, he had alleged that there was
a mutual mistake, but that if the existence of the Rutter and
Etting survey and its interference with the Dillon survey had
in any way come to the knowledge of Watts and Reeder, or
if they suspected such interference, their failure to make
known the interference before the contract was executed was
a fraud on Clark, whether so intended or not, and made the
contract null and void, and entitled Clark to a rescission thereof
and the repayment of the $35,000.
On March 18, 1887, Reeder filed his separate answer under
oath to this second supplemental and amended bill, and on
March 19, 1887, Watts also filed his separate answer thereto
likewise under oath. The answer of Reeder was that the whole
question of title to the Dillon survey was to be passed on by
Ferguson, and was so passed on by him; that whether Clark,
his agent or attorney, did or did not know at the time of the
execution of the agreement or its approval by Reeder of any
interference by the Rutter and Etting survey was altogether
immaterial, as the agreement specifically provided for a period
of thirty days after the date of said contract, in which the
counsel of Clark was to investigate the survey as to the validity of the title, and if he did not then report the title to be
good and valid, the contract would be wholly void; the report of the attorney was that he was well aware of a conflict
or interference between the two surveys, though not what
may have been its extent; and thereupon, Clark was advised
of the conflict or interference before he made any payment,

Statemcnt of the Case.

and if he had any objection to make to the title on that
ground, he should have made it before making the payment;
and, not having done so, it was now too late for him to make
such a defence. That defendant had no knowledge of what
representations were made at the time of the making of the contract; that he was not present and had no knowledge of what
had taken place, and approved the agreement of February 29,
1884, when presented to him, relying on the terms thereof as
embodying the contract between the parties.
And he set
forth the facts connected with his knowledge of the Rutter
and Etting patent.
The answer of Watts specifically denied the allegations of
the bill in reference to what took place at the time of the
preparation of the agreement of February 29, 1884, and rehearsed all that did take place on this subject, reiterating the
statement made in his previous answer that while he knew at
the time the agreement was made that there was an interlock
between the two surveys, he did not know the extent, and
gave Clark's agent and Ferguson all the information he had
on the subject.
After the filing of these answers, and after the testimony
had been taken, Clark filed an amendment on November 26,
1887, under which he charged that both Reeder and Watts,
at the time of the execution of the agreement, knew of the interlock between the two tracts, and nearly the extent of it,
and fraudulently withheld such knowledge, and thereby fraudulently induced the agent and attorney of Clark to make the
contract while they were in utter ignorance of the facts, and
that Watts fraudulently represented that there was no older
title at the time the contract was executed than the Dillon
title to any of the land embraced in the latter patent, and that
the only claim that could be set up adversely to the Reeder
title would be under junior patents; and that Clark's agent
and attorney entered into the contract believing the representations, which they would not otherwise have done; and that
the contract was procured by said fraudulent concealments
and representations.
The case was heard in the Circuit Court of the United

CLARK v. REEDER.
Statement of the Case.

'States for the District of West Virginia before Mr. Justice
Harlan, acting under a special assignment for that circuit, and
District Judge Jackson, and Mr. Justice Harlan filed an opinion, in which the District Judge concurred, October 31, 1889,
which is reported in 40 Fed. Rep. 513.
On December 4, 1889, an interlocutory decree was entered
making the opinion part of the record ; referring the case to
a special master to ascertain and report all the tracts of land,
if any, within the exterior boundaries of the Dillon survey,
as run by Sarver, which were shown to be in the possession of
persons whose right thereto was better, by reason of adverse
title and possession, than the title of Reeder; to indicate in
the report all the portions of the land'in the possession of the
junior patentees holding by a better title than Reeder; and
what lands, if any, within the survey so made by Sarver were
also in the Rutter and Etting survey, held by a better title
than that of Reeder, by reason of adverse title and possession.
The court reserved, until the coming in of the master's report, the question whether the matter of the title and possession of any one, whom complainant might allege to have a
better right to any part of the lands than defendant Reeder,
should be determined upon the proofs then in the case with
such as might be submitted with the master's report, or should
be determined by actions of ejectment. The master proceeded
to discharge the duties imposed on him, and made a report of
his findings and also a supplemental report, and thereupon,
after exceptions by both parties to the reports, the court, on
May 30, 1891, passed a final decree in the case. By this decree the court adjudicated that the contract contained in the
agreement of February 29, 1884, was binding on Clark and
Reeder; and that under it there was due from Clark to Reeder
$1.70 per acre for the number of acres included within the
boundaries of the Dillon survey as run by Sarver, after deducting from the whole number of acres the amount held by
persons who held said lands by a better title than that of
Reeder by reason of adverse title and possession ; that the total
number of acres within said exterior boundaries was 54,970,
and that the number of acres within the boundaries held by

Opinion of the Court.

persons by better title than that of Reeder by reason of adverse title and possession was 7397, leaving as the number of
acres to be paid for at $1.70 per acre, 47,572. The decree
then fixed the amount due by Clark to Reeder at $70,064,
that amount including in addition to the unpaid purchase
money for the 47,572 acres of land, charges for taxes, interest,
and the $1000 mentioned in the fifth clause of the agreement
of February 29, 1884; and decreed that upon payment of said
sum of $70,064, with accruing interest, Reeder, his wife joining, should convey the land to Clark in a deed by special warranty, and that on failure by Clark to pay the money the land
should be sold by special commissioners named in the decree.
And it was further decreed that Clark do not have the relief
prayed for in the original bill, and in his supplemental and
amended bills, and as to Watts that the bills be dismissed.
The decree further ordered that all actions of ejectment
theretofore brought by the receiver be dismissed and the receiver discharged. The case was then brought by appeal to
this court.
Mr. Joseph S. Clark and Mr. Richard C. Dale for appellant.
Mr. James Me Colgan and Mr. Bernard Carter for appellee.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the case, delivered

the opinion of the court.
The theory of the original bill was that the complainant
was entitled to a rescission of the contract of February 29,
1884, on the ground of a mutual mistake of himself and
Reeder in regard to the alleged fact that the larger part of
the land embraced in the Dillon survey was covered by the
Rutter and E.tting survey; but any such mistake was denied
by the defendant, and was not sustained by the evidence;
and by his amendment to his second supplemental bill complainant in effect abandoned the ground of mutual mistake
and asked for the rescission of the contract on the ground of
fraud only. The charge of fraud is that before and at the
time of making and executing the agreement, Reeder and
Watts knew of the existence of the Rutter and Etting survey,

CLARK v. REEDER.
Opinion of the Court.

of its location with reference to the Dillon survey, of the
interlock between the surveys and very nearly the extent of
such interlock, and that the Rutter and Etting survey was the
older of the two; that they, and each of them, intentionally
and with intent to defraud Clark, withheld and concealed from
him and from his agent and from his attorney knowledge or
information of these matters, and thereby fraudulently induced
the agent and attorney to make and execute the agreement
on behalf of Clark; that Watts on his own behalf and as the
agent of Reeder, with intent to defraud Clark, falsely represented to Clark's agent and attorney at the time of the making of the agreement that there was no older title than the
Dillon patent to any part of the land embraced therein, and
that the only claims that could or would be set up adversely
to Reeder's title would be grants for parts of the lands junior
to the Dillon patent; and that the agent and attorney, believing the statements to be true, entered into and executed the
contract on behalf of Clark, which they would not have done
except for the statements and their belief in their truth; and
that the agreement was procured to be made and executed by
and through the alleged fraudulent concealments and false
representations, but for which the contract would not have
been made.
In entering into the contract, Watts assumed to act not
only for himself but for Reeder, and we accept the ruling
of the Circuit Court that in approving the contract Reeder
assented to Watts' agency, and in taking the benefit of the
contract would be bound by any conduct on his agent's part
which might entitle Clark to a rescission.
In lFarrar v. Churchil, 135 U. S. 609, 615, we said: "The
general principles applicable to cases of fraudulent representations are well settled. Fraud is never presumed; and where
it is alleged the facts sustaining it must be clearly made out.
The representation must be in regard to a material fact, must
be false and must be acted upon by the other party in ignorance of its falsity and with a reasonable belief that it was true.
It must be the very ground on which the transaction took
place, although it is not necessary that it should have been the

Opinion of the Court.

sole cause if it were proximate, immediate, and material. If
the purchaser investigates for himself and nothing is done to
prevent his investigation from being as full as he chooses,
he cannot say that he relied on the vendor's representation."
And in Farnswortthv. Diffner, 142 U. S. 43, 47: "This is a
suit for the rescission of a contract of purchase, and to recover
the moneys paid thereon, on the ground that it was induced
by the false and fraudulent representations of the vendors.
In respect to such an action it has been laid down by many
authorities that, where the means of knowledge respecting
the matters falsely represented are equally open to purchaser
and vendor, the former is charged with knowledge of all that
by the use of such means he could have ascertained.
But if the neglect to make reasonable examination would preclude a party from rescinding a contract on the ground of
false and fraudulent, representations, a fortiori is he precluded
when it appears that he did make such examination, and relied
on the evidences furnished by such examination, and not upon
the representations." In the latter case, the syllabus of Ludington v. Renick, 7 W. Va. 273, was quoted as follows: "A
party seeking the rescission of a contract, on the ground of
misrepresentations, must establish the same by clear and irrefragable evidence; and if it appears that he has resorted to
the proper means of verification, so as to show that he in fact
relied upon his own inquiries, or if the means of investigation
and verification were at hand, and his attention drawn to
them, relief will be denied."
The contract was that Reeder agreed to sell and convey,
with covenants of special warranty, a tract of land containing
50,096 acres, more or less, which tract was granted by Virginia to Edward Dillon by patent dated April 16, 1796, and
claimed and owned by Reeder by regular chain of title, the
first being a tax deed to Ward and Lawson, dated December
22, 1857; the sale to be a sale by the acre and not in gross;
that the amount of the purchase money was to be $1.70 per
acre; that from the number of acres within the boundaries of
the grant as it had been surveyed by Sarver, with which survey Clark was satisfied, should be deducted such number of

CLARK v. REEDER.
Opinion of the Court.

acres as should be ascertained by actual survey to be held by
persons by better title than that of Reeder, by reason of adverse title and possession; and it was further provided that
the contract of sale should be void unless James I. Ferguson should within thirty days from the date of the agreement " certify the title of said Reeder to said land to be good
and valid," and if within the thirty days Ferguson should
certify that the title was good and valid, then $35,000 of the
purchase money was to be paid and the remainder as soon
thereafter as the surveys needed to ascertain what lands,
within the boundaries were held by a better title than tiat
of Reeder, by reason of adverse title and possession, were
made. The question submitted to Ferguson and to be determined by him was whether Reeder had a good and valid title
to all of the land which by the patent had been granted to,
Dillon, except those parts which should afterwards be found
to be in the actual possession of persons who denied Reeder's.
title, so that Ferguson was to examine into the validity of the
title and his certificate was to be conclusive as to that. The
amendment setting up the fraud relied on to set aside the
contract did not allege that the certificate as to the title was
given because of the reliance on the silence of Watts and
Reeder as to the interlock between the two surveys, or reliance on any affirmative representations of Watts, and if
Ferguson before giving the certificate was aware of the fact
of the interlock, what he believed when the contract was
made would furnish in itself no sufficient ground for rescission. The certificate stated that Ferguson had made a full
examination of the matter pertaining to the title to this tract
of land, and that "The only title which can be found older
than the Dillon patent is a grant from the Commonwealth of
Virginia to Rutter and Etting, dated the 9th day of January,
1796. There is from the best information I can obtain a small
portion of the Rutter and Etting survey embraced within the
Dillon survey, but the Rutter and Etting survey was forfeited
long prior to 1837 to the State of Virginia for the non-payment of 'taxes thereon and for the non-entry thereon in the
land books of the proper county, and was sold by the commis-

Opinion of the Court.

sioner of delinquent and forfeited lands some forty or more
years ago. At the time of that sale, the taxes on the Dillon
survey had always been paid, and for that reason the title to
the whole thereof became good and valid, so far as the Rutter and Etting survey is concerned." And the certificate concluded with these words: "I therefore do certify that in my
opinion the title of Charles Reeder to the said Dillon survey is
good and valid, except as to such parts of said tract of land as
may be affected by the claims of the occupants aforesaid, which
may or may not be superior to the title of said Reeder." It
thus appears that Ferguson had ascertained that at least a
part of the land was included in the older grant, and that he
nevertheless certified that the title to the land covered by the
Dillon survey was good and valid because he knew and declared that the Rutter and Etting grant had been forfeited
long prior to 1837, and determined that because of the forfeiture and the fact that the taxes on the Dillon land had
always been paid, the title had become vested in the holder
of the Dillon grant. It is true that Ferguson testified that he
obtained the information that a portion of the land covered
by the Dillon grant was included within the Rutter and Etting grant from Watts between the time of the execution of
the agreement and the giving of his certificate, and that Watts
represented the interference as but 'small; yet it would seem
that if Ferguson considered the question of the existence of
the interference material he would have examined into its extent, and his certificate shows that he considered the Rutter
and Etting grant altQgether null and void, and that by its forfeiture the Dillon title had become perfected, so that, knowing
as he did that there was an interlock, it cannot be assumed
that Ferguson was affected by the failure of Watts and Reeder
to tell him of its existence or by the assertion of Watts that
no older title interfered with the Dillon grant. Moreover, it
does not appear that Watts had any particular information as
to the extent of the interference which was not open to every
one, and probably reliable information upon the subject depended upon the surveys of the two tracts.
The record shows that Mr. Ferguson had had a large ex-

CLARK v. REEDER.
Opinion of the Court.

perience in the examination of land titles in West Virginia,
their forfeiture and validity, the overlapping of different
grants for the same land, and the construction of the laws
of Virginia and West Virginia in regard to land titles; and
that he had practised many years in the counties where the
land was situated. He testified that when he first commenced to practise in that locality these surveys were in the
counties of Fayette and Logan as he now understood their
boundaries, and that, in the course of his practise in Logan
County, he became acquainted with the existence of both of
the surveys and with the fact that the Rutter and Etting survey had been sold as forfeited and delinquent by General Albert
Beckley, commissioner of delinquent and forfeited lands for
Fayette County. That sale took place in 1840, and the report of General Beckley, made to the Circuit Court of Fayette County, stated that the Rutter and Etting grant had been
carefully resurveyed, and that the survey showed that within
the boundaries of said Rutter and Etting grant nearly the
whole of the 50,096 acres patented to Edward Dillon was
included. The matter of such a claim was of record then as
early as 1840, and the certificate refers to the sale, so that no
matter what was the opinion about it expressed by Watts, if
the question of the extent of the interlock was material, a
survey might well have been had before the certificate was
given.
The record further discloses that copies of both the Dillon
and the Rutter and Etting grants were sent to Watts by
IReeder and delivered to Clark's agent for Ferguson, and
Clark says in his second amended and supplemental bill that
he is informed by his said counsel that when the fact that the
Rutter and Etting survey covered a portion of the Dillon survey came to his knowledge after the execution and approval
of the contract and after examination and investigation, he, as
far as was then possible, looked into the matter and was satisfied that if there was any interference between the two surveys
it was so small and unimportant as not to seriously impair the
value of the Dillon survey even if it should prove the better
title, and in this belief he gave his certificate; a statement

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

quite different from asserting that he acted on the statements,
of Watts as to the extent of the interference.
Apart from all this, we cannot consistently hold that the evidence sustains the amendment to the second supplemental bill
to the effect that Reeder and Watts knew of the extent of the
interference of the Rutter and Etting grant, and that it
included the larger part of the Dillon grant, and wilfully and
fraudulently withheld the information, because they believed
that if known to Clark or his agent or attorney it would prevent the sale of the land, or that Watts affirmatively represented that there had never been any older grant which affected
the Dillon grant.
We entirely concur with the statement of Mr. Justice
Harlan in his opinion on the circuit, that: "I am satisfied that
no one connected with this business knew the full extent of
this interlock." It is not pretended that Reeder made any
representation to Clark or his agent or attorney, and his testimony shows that in the course of the survey of 1873 by Sarver,
the survey which by the agreement was declared to be taken
as ascertaining satisfactorily the boundaries of the land, Sarver
discovered that there was some interference between the two
surveys, and pointed out the place where the south line of the,
Rutter and Etting survey crossed the western line of the Dillon survey; and Reeder testified that "exactly how much land
was embraced in the interlock was not known, and I did not
consider it important to know, as I was advised, by my counsel, and had other good authority for believing, that the Dillon
title would unquestionably hold as against the Rutter and
Etting, and consequently as against titles derived from the
Rutter and Etting." And he said in his answer to the interrogatories of the second supplementary bill: "I did not then
nor do I now know to what extent the Rutter and Etting survey laps on the Dillon, nor do I think that any one else knows,
because from the facts which have come to my knowledge I
do not think that any more than the first line of the Rutter
and Etting survey was ever run by the surveyor originally."
There appears in the record a letter from Watts to Reeder
under date of November 8, 1873, in reply to one from Reeder

CLARK v. REEDER.
Opinion of the Court.

enclosing him a sketch from the Sarver survey, which sketch
showed that the larger part of the Dillon tract was included
in the Rutter and Etting grant, (also called the Duval, Duval
having made the original entry,) in which Watts not only gave
his own reasons for believing that the sketch did not truly
represent the relations of the two tracts, and that in his judgment it would be impossible for the Duval to lap on the Dillon
survey, but advised Mr. Reeder that he had showed Judge
Ward the sketch and plats Reeder had sent, and Judge Ward
told him the Dillon survey was perfect, the best in West Virginia; and that the Duval had never been run; and Watts
added that he was satisfied that this was true, and that the
Duval was only gotten up for a speculation. We think it
does not admit of reasonable doubt that Mr. Reeder believed
that there was nothing in the Rutter and Etting grant which
impaired his title to the Dillon grant, although, nevertheless,
he sent, with all his title-papers, the copies of the surveys of
both tracts to Watts at the time a sale of the land was contemplated "for examination, and in order that it should be a
full and thorough examination."
And notwithstanding a serious conflict of evidence, we are
not persuaded that the specific statements of Watts in his
answers, and his testimony, as to his knowledge of the extent
of the interlock, and as to what he communicated to Ferguson
and Bell, in denial of any fraudulent concealment or fraudulent representation, can properly be treated as overcome, the
documentary and undisputed evidence being considered, and
due regard being had to the infirmities of human memory. It
was known at the time the certificate was given that the Rutter and Etting patent was older than the Dillon patent, and
that there was an interlock, but the parties had agreed to take
the exterior boundaries of the Dillon survey as made by
Sarver, and Clark was given the right by a survey at his own
expense to ascertain what lands within those boundaries were
held by a better title than Reeder's, by reason of adverse title
and possession. And if the Rutter and Etting survey had
been forfeited long prior to 1837, and the title to the Dillon
survey had become good and valid so far as the Rutter and
VOL. CLVIII-34

OCTOBER TERM, 1894.
Opinion of the Court.

Etting survey was concerned, or this was believed to be so by
all parties, it is not extraordinary when afterwards the extent
of the interlock was raised as an objection to complying with
the contract, that there might be a want of precision of recollection as to exactly what did pass in reference to that particular matter. It is remarkable that nowhere in the pleadings
or in the testimony is it alleged or suggested that the Rutter
and Etting title is good and valid as against Reeder under the
Dillon title. The result of the report of the special master was
that the only portion of the whole of the Dillon survey now
in the possession of persons claiming title adverse to Reeder
was 7397.75 acres, out of a total of 54,907.5 acres, and 7379.75
was by the final decree adjudged to be the number of acres
actually held by better title than that of Reeder by reason of
adverse title and possession, and for this Clark was not required
to pay; and in relation to this matter we cannot do better than
to quote from the opinion of the Circuit Court, as follows:
"The utmost shown is that most of the Dillon survey is within
the lines of the Rutter and Etting survey; but, as already said,
this might be true, and yet Reeder's right be the better in
law. Can it be a sufficient ground to set aside the contract
for the plaintiff to show that a large part of the lands in question are within the lines of a patent older than the one under
which Reeder claims and that they are claimed adversely to
Reeder, especially when Reeder only agreed to convey with
special warranty, and when the plaintiff agreed to pay for all
the lands covered by the Sarver survey, except such as were
shown by a survey, had at his expense, to be held ' by adverse
title and possession,' constituting a better title than Reeder's ?
I think not."
We are of opinion that the Circuit Court was right in concluding that complainant was not entitled to a rescission of the
contract.
By the interlocutory decree the court directed the ascertainment of the number of acres of land within the exterior
boundaries of the Dillon grant as run by Sarver to which there
was shown to be a better title than Reeder's, "by reason of
adverse title and possession," and this included any who were

CLARK v. REEDER.
Opinion of the Court.

in adverse possession claiming title under the Rutter-Etting
patent, and who by reason of such adverse title and possession
had a better title than Reeder; and, this having been done,
the final decree on the cross-bill adjudged and decreed the
amount to be paid to Reeder by Clark, and on failure of Clark
so to do, the sale of the land. We see no reason to question
the correctness of that course. The Circuit Court held, and
we have arrived at the same conclusion, that Clark was not
entitled to rescind the contract on the ground of fraud; and
this involved holding that Clark was bound by the contract
according to its terms, and consequently to pay for the number of acres embraced within the exterior bounds of the Dillon grant, as surveyed by Sarver, less the number of acres
within those boundaries held by a better title than that of
Reeder by reason of adverse title and possession. This being
so, and the number of acres having been ascertained in accordance with that contract, Reeder was entitled to a decree
for a sale of the land for the sum due him as the balance of
the purchase money.
A court of equity may sometimes refuse to decree specific
performance in favor of one party when it would also refuse
to rescind in favor of the other. But this is not a case to
which that principle is applicable. Nor is it a case in which
a vendor asks the court to compel a purchaser to accept a
doubtful title. It is a case where the decree gives to the purchaser what he purchased, in accordance with the terms of
his contract, and the vendor is entitled to have the property
devoted to the payment of the purchase price if the purchaser declines to pay.
