BOYNTON v. BALL.
Syllabus.

a difference of one or two hundredths of one per cent in the
amount of phosphorus in pig iron could be detected by observation of the ore, or by inspection of the manufacture of thepig iron. Under these circumstances, evidence of the amount
of phosphorus in iron made in previous years was wholly
irrelevant to the question of the amount of phosphorus in iron
made in 1880; and the general expressions of opinion as to

the excellence of the pig iron and the care taken in its manufacture did not render that evidence competent, but rather
tended to divet the attention of the jury from the real issue,
which was whether the particular iron tendered by the plaintiff
to the defendant conformed to the express warranty in the
contract between them.
The case differs from that of Ames v. Quimby, 106 'U. S.
342, where, in an action to recover the price of shovel-handles
sold to the defendant, evidence of the good quality of other
like handles sold by the plaintiff at -the same time was admitted, accompanied by direct evidence that the' latter were
of the same kind and-quality as the former.
This testimony being irrelevant and incompetent, and manifestly tending to prejudice the defendants with the jury, its
admission requires the verdict to be set aside; and it becomes
unnecessary to consider the rulings upon other evidence and
upon the question of damages.
Judgment reversed, and case remanded to the Circuit Court,
with directions to set aside the verdict and to order a new
trial.

BOY-NTON t'. BALL.
iRROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLMOIS.
Argued April 4, 5, 1887.-Decided April 25, 1887.

A discharge in bankruptcy may be set up in a state court to stay the issue
of execution on a judgment recovered against the bankrupt after the
commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy and before the discharge; although the defendant did not before the judgment ask for a
stay of proceedings under Rev, Stat. § 5106.

Statement of Facts.

IN the year 1865 Ball, the defendant in error, and one
Griffin, since deceased, recovered a judgment against Boynton, the plaintiff in error, for $6223.99. In April, 1875, Ball
commenced an acticn of debt in a state court of Illinois against.
Ball, to recover the amount of that judgment and interest
On the 19th of Mffarch, 1878, a rule was made that the
defendant should plead, and on the 4th of the following April
he pleaded as follows:
"And the defendant, by James I. Neff, his attorney, comes
and defends the wrofig and injury when, &c., and says that he.
qqes not owe the said sum of money above demanded or anypart thereof in manner and form as the plaintiff hath above
thereof complained against him. And of this the defendalit
puts himself upon the country, &c."
On this plea issue was joined, and, a jury being waived, the
case was submitted to the court. At December Term, 1879,
judgment was entered in the plaintiff's favor against the
defendant for the sum of $623.99 debt, and $5234.99 damages. Execution issued therefor, which was returned unsatisfied on the 20th Iay, 1880.
' On the 25th March, 1881, Boynton filed a motion for a perpetual stay of execution on that judgment, supporting it by
proof that he was declared a bankrupt on the 15th day of
April, 1878, and that he received his certificate of discharge
on the 23d December, 1880. Notice of this motion was
served on Ball, who appeared.and opposed the granting of it,
setting up the appearance of Boynton in the suit, his plea, the
joinder of issue, the submission to the court, and the eltry of
Judgment - all after the commencement of the proceedings in
bankruptcy, though before the date of the discharge. At the
hearing in the Circuit Court at March Term, 1881, the motion
for the stay of execution was denied. This judgment was
affirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of Illinois in March,
1882. Boynton v. Bag, 105 IM. 627. Boynton then sued out

court -wijl stay execution, ard each and every of them decisions made upon bankrupt acts having nothing like the section of the act of 1867 found in the Rev. Stat. § 5106; that
being a .'.zw section, and they are no authorities as tQ3the
duty that section imposes upon the bankrupt.
Section 14 of St. 49 Geo. III, c. 121, quoted by plaintiff in
error, prohibits any creditor who shall have brought action or
instituted suit against a bankrupt, on any demand arising
.prio#to bankruptcy, or which might have been proved, from
proving a debt unless on condition of relinquishing such suit
or action. St.' 6 Geo. IV, c. 16, § 59, also quoted by plaintiff, is
to same effect.
Section 5 of the act of Congressof 1841, cited by plaintiff,
provides that no creditor coming in and proving his debt shall
be allowed to maintain any suit therefor, but shall be deemed
to have waived all right of action; and it declares, as the
effect of so proving, all actions commenced and unsatisfied
judgments already pbtained surrendered. Section 5105 of the
Revised Statutes is to precisely the same effect. But inasmuch
as Ball, the here defendant, has never proved his debt against
Boynton, the plaintiff in error, nor has Ball in any way or
manner connected himself with Boynton's bankruptcy
proceedings, it is submitted that all the above mentioned sections
have no bearing whatever on any question in this case.
St. 34 & 35 H. VIII, c. 4, enacted in 1549, was the first
bankrupt aet. Its preamble is as follows: "1Whereas,divers
and sundry Persons craftily obtaining into their hands great
substances of other Men's Goods, do suddenly flee to, parts
unknown, or keep their Houses, not minding to pay or restore
to any of their Creditors their Debts and Duties, but at their
own Wills and Pleasures, consume the Substance obtained by
Credit of other Men for their Pleasure and delicate Living,
against all Reason, Equity, and good Conscience; therefore,
be it enacted,.ete."
Every succeeding act up to St. 4 & 5 Anne, c. 17, contained
like severe denunciations against this class of delinquents. By
this last mentioned act it is provided that if the bankrupt has
fully turned over all his estate to his creditors, and made full

BOYNTON v. BALL.
Argument for Defendant in Error.

disclosure, he shall have a certain allowance or exeimption,
and shall also, having fully conformed to the act, be allowed
a certificate. This is the first statute giving either, an1 was
continued into the more permanent act of St. 5 Geo. II,c. 30,
where, by the 7th section, a discharge is given from all debts
by him owing at the time he became bankrupt; and in case
he should, after having received his certificate, be arrested,
prosecuted, or imprisoned for any debt due before the time
he became bankrupt, he was to be discharged on common
bail, and might plead that the cause of action accrued before
his bankruptcy.
No such provision, or anything having even a resemblance
to § 5106, is to be found in either the Bankrupt Act of 1800,
2 Stat. 19, or that of 1841, 5 Stat. 440; consequently, any
decision predicated on those acts has no weight, and is of
little authority in determining the effect of, and duties
imposed on the bankrupt by, this new section in the act of
1867.
This was a new feature of the bankrupt law; neither it, nor
anything like it, had ever existed, either in lEngland or this
country, and experience indicated, and justice demanded; that
there should be some mode provided by which, when a §uit
was pending against a defendant (as was Ball v. Boynton),
and he went into banklmptcy, that when adjudicated a bankrupt he could stay such suit until the question of whether
he was to get a discharge should have been first determined.
The act created this privilege and defence, which, if 'defendant had then interposed in this case, the judgment in
question never could, on his own theory-of the effect of his
discharge, have been recovered against him. Tis duty, after
going into bankruptcy, is clearly pointed out in Holden v.
Sherwood, 84 Ill. 94, where the defendant, after verdict,
suggested his bankruptcy, and filed his discharge, but did
nothing more. Uniformly, since our very first act on the
subject, the bankrupt having a certificate of discharge, has
been required to plead it. -Fellows v. Itall, 3 XcLean, 281;

Argument for Defendant-in Error.

We submit that the precedents established under a statute
unlike any act of Congress ever existing here, establishedno
principle that can be deduced dfrom any bankrupt act ever in
force in this country. And we maintain that § 5106 Rev.
Stat. afforded defendant an- ample opportunity and remedy,
of which he neglected to avail himself for over nindteen
months before our judgment. He then came into court, and
without any intimation that he had gone into bankruptcy, or
should! rely on his bankruptcy, actually joined us in submitting his case for trial,by which we obtained our judgment
incurring the costs thereof, and of the execution issued
thereon, and he is, therefore, now estopped from interposing
his discharge.
The rendition of the new judgment upon the old decree
made such a new and essentially different debt that it thereby
became not provable against his estate, and is not affected by
his discharge. See ln re Gallison, 2 Lowell 72, andd the reasoning .of the court, and the authorities on both sides cited in

,Opinion-of the Court.

to this court to review the judgment of the state cotirt, arises
out of the refusal of that court to give effect to a certificate of
discharge in bankruptcy to Boynton, the plaintiff in error.
Ball, the defendant. in error, brought suit against Boynton
in the Circuit Court of the state of Illinois for Stephenson
County, on April 16, 1877. To this Boynton filed his answer
April 4, 1878, and judgment was rendered against him on
December 9, 1879, for $6223.99 debt, and $5234.99 damages
and costs. Pending this suit in the state court Boynton, on
his own application, was declared a bankrupt April 15, 1878,
and received his discharge from all his debts December 23,
1880. An execution on the judgment 'against Boynton in the
state court was issued February 21, 1880, and reurned unsatisfied. On March 25, 1881, Boynton filed a petition in the
state court, asking for a perpetual stay of execution on the
judgment readered in favor of Ball, and filed a certified copy
of his discharge in bankruptcy, together with certain affidavits. Ball was served with notice of this motion and appeared
and made defence. The motion was overruled by the circuit
court, from which ruling Boynton appealed to the Supreme.
Court of the state, which court affirmed the judgment of the
court below with costs. 105 Ill. 627.
The question presented for us to consider-is, whether the
discharge in bankruptcy was, under the circumstances of this
case, a discharge from the judgment rendered in the circuit
court of Stephenson County while the proceedings in bankruptcy were pending. It will.be perceived that the suit in the
state court was commenced bef6re the proceedings in bankruptcy in which the discharge was finally granted. It will
also, be perceived that the case lingered in the state court from
April 16, 1877, until December 9, 1879, when the final judgment was rendered, a period of over two years, but that the
plaintiff in error did not obtain his final discharge in bankruptcy until December 23, 1880, which was more than a year
after the judgment was obtained against him in the state
court.
In !Dimock v. The Revere- Croper Co., 117 U. S.559, decided
at the last term of this court, a case very similar to this was

OCTOBER TERM, 1886.
Opinion of the Court.

presented to us for our consideration. Dimock, being sued in
the state court of Massachusetts, made defence, and pending
the action was discharged from all his debts under bankruptcy
proceedings, receiving his certificate of discharge as a bankrupt a few days before final judgment against him in the
state court. Notwithstanding he had this discharge at the
time the judgment was rendered against him in the state
court, he did not plead it in bar of that action nor bring it in
any manner to the attention of the court. He was afterwards
sued upon this judgment in the Supreme Court of the state of
New York, and there pleaded his discharge in bankruptcy in
bar -of the action. That court, however, held the certificate of
discharge not to be a bar, and rendered judgment against him.
This judgment was reversed in the Supreme Court, in General
Term, and that judgment was in turn reversed by the Court
of Appeals, which restored the judgment of the court in Special Term. This court, in reviewing that judgment, said that
the Superior Court of M assachusetts, in which the first suit
-was brought, had jurisdiction of the case, which was rendered
complete by the service of process and the appearance of the
defendant; that nothing that Was done in the bankruptcy
court had ousted the jurisdiction of that court, which, accordingly, proceeded in due order to judgment; that this judgment
having been 'rendered after the certificate of discharge in
bankruptcy which had not been called to the attention of the
court in any manner, nor any stay of proceedings in the state
court asked on account of the pendency of the bankruptcy
proceedings, the question before the Massachusetts court for
decision at the time it rendered judgment was, whether
Dimock was then indebted to the Revere Copper Company,
and we held that it had jurisdiction and rightfully renderedl
judgment on this question in favor of that company, notwiths,tanding the proceedings in the bankruptcy court of which it
could not take judicial notice. This decision was supported by
references to cases heretofore decided involving similar questions in this court and in the courts of the states.
The principle on which the case was decided was that, while
the discharge in bankruptcy would hhve been a valid defence

BOYNTON v. BALL.4

Opinion of the Court.

to the suit if pleaded at or before the time judgment was
rendered in the Massachusetts court, it had in that respect
no more sanctity or effect in relieving Dimock of his debt to
the company than a payment, or a receipt, or a release, of
which he was bound to avail himself by plea or suggestion of
some kind as a defence to the action in proper time; that,
showing no good reason why he should not have presented
that discharge, and permitting the judgment to go against
him in the Massachusetts court, without an attempt t6 avail
himself of it there, the judgment of that court was c-nclusive
on the question of his indebtedness at that time to the copper
company. That case, so parallel in its circumstances to the
one now before us, would be conclusive of the latter 4f
Boynton had had his certificate of discharge, or if the order
for it had been made by the bankruptcy court before the
judgment in the state court. But, as we have already seen,
the judgment in the state court was rendered more than a
year before the order of discharge in the bankruptcy court,
and Boynton therefore had no opportunity to plead a discharge which had not then been granted, as a defence to that
action.
Two propositions are advanced by counsel for defendant in
error, in support of the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Illinois, as reasons why the certificate obtained so long after
the judgment in the state court should not have the effect of
a discharge of the debt evidenced by that judgment. The
first of these is, that the original debt on which the action was

brought in the Circuit Court of Stephenson County no longer
exists, but that it was merged in the judgment of that court
against Boynton, and was therefore not released under the act
of Congress, which declares that all debts provable against
the estate of th6 bankrupt at -the time bankruptcy proceedings were initiated shall be satisfied by the order of the
court discharging the bankrupt. The argument is, that the
judgment now existing against Boynton is not the debt that
existed at the time bankruptcy proceedings were initiated;
that by the change of the character of the debt from an
ordinary claim or obligation to -a judgment of a court of
voL. CXxi-30

OCTOBER TERM, 1886.
Opinion of the Court.

record it ceased to be the same debt and became a new and
different debt as of the date of the judgment. Some authorities are cited for this general proposition of a change of the
character of the debt by merger into the judgment, and
some authorities are also cited by counsel for plaintiff in error
to the contrary. See Judge Blatchford, In re Brown, 5
Benedict, 1; In re .Rosey, 6 Benedict, 507.
But this court, to which this precise question is now presented for the first time, is clearly of opinion that the debt on
which this judgment was rendered is the same debt that it
was before; that, notwithstanding the change in its form
from that of a simple contract debt, or untiquidated claim, or
whatever its character may have been,. b merger into a judgment of 'a court of record, it still refnains the. same debt on
which the action was brought in the state.- court and the
'existence of which was provable in bankruptcy,. '.The next proposition is, that under § 5106 of the Revised
Statutes of the United States it was the duty of Boynton to
make application to the state court, before judgment in that
court., to have the proceedings there stayed, to await the
determination of the court in bankruptcy on the question of
his discharge. That section is inthe following language:
"No creditor whose debt is provable shall be allowed to
prosecute to final judgment any suit at law or in equity therefor against the bankrupt, until the, question of the debtor's
discharge shall have been determined; and any such suit 6r
proceedings shall, upon the application of the bankrupt, be
stayed to await the determination of the court in bankruptcy
on the question of the discharge, provided there is no unreasonable delay on the part of the bankrupt in endeavoring to
obtain his discharge; and provided, also, that if the amount
due the creditor is in dispute, the suit, by leave of the court in
bankruptcy, niay proceed to judgment for the purpose of
ascertaining the amount due, which amount may be proved in
bankruptcy, but execution shall be stayed."
This cannot be construed to mean, anything more than that
where the bankruptcy propeedings are brought to the attention of the.court hi which'a suit is be'ing prosecuted against a

BOYNTON v. BALL.Opinion of the Court.

bankrupt, that court shall not proceed to final judgment until
the question of his discharge shall have been determined.
The state court could not know or take judicial notice of the
proceedings in bankruptcy unless they were brought before it
in some appropriate manner, and ,the provisio.s of this sedtionshow plainly that it does not thereupon loseojurisdiction of the
case, but the proceedings may, upon the application of the
bankrupt, be stayed to await the determination of 6he court
in bankruptcy, on the -question of his discharge,, Even the
direction that it shall be stayed is coupled with a condition
that "there is no unreasonable delay on the part of the bankrupt in endeavoring t6 obtain his discharge;" and with the
further provision that ,"if the amount due the creditor is in
dispute, the suit, by leave of the court in bankruptcy, may
proceed to judgment for the purpose of ascertaining the
amount due."
These provisions exclude-altogether the idea that the state
court has lost jurisdiction of the case, even when the bankrupt
shall have made application showing the proceedings against
him. The whole section is also clearly impressed with the
idea that this is a provision primarily for the benefit of the
'bankrupt, that he may be enabled to avoid being harassed in.
both courts at the same time with regard to such debt. It is
therefore a right which he may waive. He may be willing
that the suit shall proceed in the state court for many reasons;
first, because he is not sure that he will ever obtain his discharge from the court in bankruptcy, in which case it would
do him no good to delay the proceedings at his expense in the
state court; in the second place, he may have a defence in the
state court which he is quite willing to rely upon there, and to
have the issue tried; in the third place, he may be very willing
to have the amount in dispute liquidated in that proceeding,
in which case it becomes a debt to be paid pro rata with his
other debts by the assignee in bankruptcy.
If for any of these reasons, or for others, he permits the
case to proceed to judgment in the state court, by failing to
procure a stay of proceedings under the provisions of this
section of the bankrupt law, or the assignee in bankruptcy

OCTOBER TERM,

Opinion of the Court.

'des not intervene as he may do, Hill v. HMarding, 107 U. S.
631, he does nhot thereby forfeit his right to plead his flnal
discharge in bankruptcy, if he shall obtain it,. at any appropriate stage of the proceedings against him in the state court.
And if, as in the present case, his final discharge is not obtained until after judgment has been rendered against him in
the state court, he may produce .that discharge to the state
court and obtain the stay of execution which he asks for now.
See i clDougald v. _Jeid,.5 Ala. 810.
In Rogers v. The Western M2farine and Fire Ins. Co., 1 La.
Ann. 161, the court in a similar case, says: "The proposition that Rogers should have pleaded the pendency of the
bankrupt proceedings in the original suit, and cannot disturb
the execution of the judgment which is final, is untenable.
The discharge in bankruptcy was posterior to the rendition of
this judgment, and operated with the same force upon the
debt after it assumed the form of a judgment as it would
have done had the debt remained in its original form of a
promissory note."
.These and many other decisions under the bankrupt law of
1841 are to be found in the brief of the plaintiff in error.
The same" principle is decided 'in C'ornell v. Dakin, 38 N. Y.
253, and in several case- in the District and Circuit Courts of
the United-Stats. There is very able review of the subject
by Tudge Hillyer of the United States District Court of Nevada, in the case of Stansfeld, reported in 4 Sawyer, 334.
The same thing was held by the Court of Appeals of New
York, in PZamer v. Hiissey., 87 N. Y. 303, 310, which was
affirhed in this court oft writ of error in Palmer v. Hussey,
119 U. S. 96.
It follows from tliese considerations that
The Supreme Court of Illinois wag in error in failing to
give due. efect to Boynton's discharge.in -bankruptcy,and
its judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to that
court f'r further proeedings in accordance 'with thisopinion.-
