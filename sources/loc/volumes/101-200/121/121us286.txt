JUsTicE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.

These are writs of error brought for the review of judgments of the Supreme Court of Alabama. No assignment of
errors was returned with the writ in either of the cases, as
required by ยง 997 of the Revised Statutes. No counsel has
appeared for the plaintiffs in error, but the cases have both
been submitted by the defendants in error on briefs, without
any specification of errors by the plaintiffs, as required by
Rule 21, ยง 2, 108 U. S. 585. We, therefore, affirm. the judgment in each case,.under ยง 4 of the same rule, 108 U. S. 585,
for want of a due prosecution of the writ of error.
A4ffirmed.
