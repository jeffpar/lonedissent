delivered the opinion of the court.

This case is within the spirit, although not within the letter
Rule 32. The state court refused to 'let go its jurisdiction
on a petition for removal, and the Supreme Court of the State
has affirmed the ruling of the trial court to that effect. The
only questioii for our consideration on the -writ of error is
whether this decision was right. The case is advanced to be
brought on for hearing in the way provided by Rule 32, that
is to say, under the rules prescribed by Rule 6 in regard to
motions to dismiss writs of error or appeals.
