CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.
We have no jurisdiction in this case. The suit was brought
by Dows & Co. to recover damages for the unlawful conversion of ten thousand bushels of corn, the value of which, accord-'
ing to the findings, did not exceed $6,000. With interest added
to this sum from the date of the alleged conversion until the
judgment, the most that could have been recovered, upon the
special finding, was $6,360. A judgment was in fact rendered
for $2,430. The matter in dispute in this court is the difference
between these two sums, or only $3,930. In Hiltonv. Dickinson,
108 U. S. 165, it was settled that our jurisdiction depends on
the value of the matter in dispute here, and as that in the present case is less than $5,000, it follows that the suit must be dismissed; and it is so ordered.
Dimissed.
AER.
