but it is not binding on the same ground that the principal
is not binding upon her personally. Nevertheless, as it is a
rate that may be lawfully stipulated for,- if it is stipulated
for, and is made part of the consideration for which a lien is
retained on the land,- it is as much secured by the lien as the

Affirmed.

Amn-s v. QuaiBY.
1. A rule of court in Michigan provides, that where a defendant pleads matter of
set-off, founded on a written instrument, he cannot "be put to the proof of
the execution of the instrument or the handwriting" of the opposite party,
unless an affidavit is filed "denying the same." Held, that the want of
such affidavit does not preclude the plaintiff from showing that such an
instrument, dated January 2, was executed on Sunday, January 1, or that
his duplicate of an instrument executed in duplicate by him and the
defendant differs in its contents from the one retained by the defendant.
2. The plaintiff, where the quality of goods which he furnished at a given time
to the defendant is in question, may shpw the good quality of like articles furnished at the same time by him to another party, if he further
shows that those he furnished to each party were of the same kind and
quality.
3. Where the evidence is such that, as to a given matter, there is no question for
the jury, a charge and a refusal to charge in regard to such matter are not
a ground for reversing the judgment, because they work no injury to the
party excepting.
4. The court charged the jury that while the plaintiff could not recover for any
more goods than his bill of particulars set forth, lie was not bound by a
mistake in carrying out the rate or price, but could show what lie was actually to have, it not appearing by the record what were the contents of the
bill, but it appearing that the plaintiff claimed there was a mistake in it in
that respect. Held, that the charge was not erroneous.
5. After a new trial has been had, pursuant to the mandate of this court, and a
second judgment rendered, no errors other than those committed after the
mandate was received below can be considered here.

AMES v. QUIMBY.

MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the
court.
The defendant in error brought this suit against the plaintiffs in error in July, 1872, in a court of the State of Michigan.
It was removed into the Circuit Court for the Western District of Michigan in August, 1872, before the declaration was
filed. The action is assumpsit. The declaration claims $25,000
for goods sold and delivered, and a like amount for money had
and received, and $15,000 for interest. The plea was nonassumpsit with a notice of set-off to the aniount of $25,000,
and a notice that the goods alleged to have been furnished by
the plaintiff were furnished under a special contract that they
were to be of first-class quality, and that they were not. A
further notice under the plea alleged that the goods furnished
were furnished under three several contracts, made Jan. 2,
1865, Jan. 27, 1866, and Dec. 25, 1866, for the fuitishing
by the plaintiff to the defendants of shovel-handles, and that
the plaintiff did not fulfil the contracts as to the quality of the
handles. In April, 1875, the suit was tried by the court without a jury. On the findings of the court a judgment was rendered for the plaintiff for $7,825.62. The defendants brought
the case to this court by a writ of error, and the judgment was
reversed, and the cause was remanded to the Circuit Court
with directions to award a new trial. The decision of this
court is reported in 96 U. S. 824. The only question there
presented and determined was as to the proper construction of
a written contract made between the parties, Jan. 2, 1865, in
a particular not now important. The construction put by the
court below upon that contract was held to have been erroneous. The case was tried a second time before a jury in
April, 1879. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for
$12,816.53, and a judgment thereon was rendered against the
defendants. To review and reverse this judgment the present
writ of error has been brought.
The plaintiff, to maintain the issues on his part, read in
evidence a stipulation signed by the respective attorneys,
whereby the defendants admitted the sale and delivery of
shovel-handles shipped to the defendants' firm and received by
it at North Easton, Massachusetts, at the dates and in the

quantities therein set forth, being, in 1865, 15,607 dozen,
in 6 items, in May and July; in 1866, 10,188 dozen, in 13
items, in June, July, August, and September, and 2,852 dozen,
in 3 items, in November and December, up to the 20th; in
1867, 33,814 dozen, in 37 items, in every month but January,
November, and December; and, in 1868, 11,113 dozen, in 11
items, in April, May, July, September, and October. The
stipulation stated that the dates given were the dates of the
shipment by rail from Michigan and Canada; that the dates of
the receipt bythe defendants at North Easton were fifteen
days later than the several dates of shipment; and that the
plaintiff admitted payments on account of said handles, at the
dates and in the sums specified thereafter in the stipulation,
the payments amounting to $83,153.48. The stipulation concluded with this clause: "The question of the quality of the

not stipulated, are left open to the jury and for other and

witness on his own behalf. On his cross-examination he testified that there was a contract signed by the parties for 1865
for handles. The contract being shown to him, he "identified"
it, as the bill of exceptions states, and it was read in evidence
by the defendants. It bore the date of Jan. 2, 1865. The
plaintiff rested his case, and the defendants introduced testimony and rested their defence. One of the defendants testified
that he made the contract of 1865, and it was made in the
evening, and he stated who were present. Then the plaintiff,
being recalled, testified, without objection, that the contract
dated Jan. 2, 1865, was not signed on that day- on the
evening of that day. He was then asked, "When was that
contract signed?" The defendants objected to the question
on the ground that "it was irrelevant and immaterial, and
there had been no previous denial by affidavit or otherwise of
the execution of the contract, and it was incompetent." The
plaintiff replied that the fact of the execution of the contract
was not denied, "but he proposes to show the time of the execution of the contract was on Sunday, which avoids the contract." The court overruled the objection, and the defendants
excepted. The witness then answered that the contract was

signed and delivered on Sunday, Jan. 1, 1865, stating the
hour and the place, and giving particulars as to who were
present and what was done. The defendants then gave testimony by three witnesses to contradict the plaintiff. The
defendants now contend that the court erred in permitting the
plaintiff to testify that the contract was executed on Sunday,
in view of the then situation of the case and what had transpired on the trial; that he had given evidence as to its execution and allowed it to be put in evidence without suggesting
any infirmity in it; and that the defendants would necessarily
be surprised by such testimony. The defendants also claim
that, under a rule of court governing the pleadings and practice in Michigan, where a defendant insists on a claim by way
of set-off, founded on a written instrument, he cannot "be put
to the proof of the execution of the instrument or the handwriting" of the opposite party, unless an affidavit is filed
"denying the same;" that the failure of the plaintiff to file
such affidavit was an admission of the execution of the instrument in manner and form as set up, and as being of the date
of January 2; and that the testimony went to show that the
contract set up was not executed.
The only ground alleged at the trial for the incompetency of
the evidence was that the execution of the contract had not
been denied by affidavit. Assuming that the rule of court
referred to can be taken notice of by this court, it not being set
forth in the record, and there being no statement in the record
that the affidavit referred to was required by any rule of court,
and assuming that it is to be inferred that there was not any
such affidavit, it not being set forth in the bill of exceptions
that there was not, we are of opinion that the rule cited refers
only to proof of the genuineness of a seal or of handwriting,
and does not refer to any matter which goes to show the invalidity otherwise of an instrument. Such a provision in a rule
of court or in a statute is not uncommon, and, whenever it is
expressed in language such as that now presented, it has never.
that we are aware, received any other construction. In the
case of Pegg v. Bidleman, 5 Mich. 26, Pegg and another
were sued on a note signed "S. Pegg & Co." They appeared
and pleaded the general issue, but did not deny on oath the

[Sup. ot.

execution of the note. Judgment was 'given against them
without proof that they "composed the firm of S. Pegg & Co.
and executed the note." It was held that, as the defendants'
had appeared, and the declaration was against them as individuals and did not allege they were partners, the question was
simply whether they executed the note by the name subscribed
to it; and that they must be taken to have admitted that the
note -was executed by the parties declared against. The decision was that the admission covered the fact that the signature
was that of the parties sued. If the parties be sued as partners,
the admission that the signature is their signature as partners
necessarily admits that they were partners. This was the
principle applied in Thomas v. Clarkc, 2 McLean, 194, and
Pratt v. Willard, 6 id. 27. In Curran v. Rogers, 35 Mich.
221, a written contract was signed in the name of a firm, the
two partners in which were sued on the contract. The general
issue was pleaded without any affidavit. One of the firm
sought to prove that the other, who had signed the firm name,'
had no authority to do so. It was held that, as the declaration
set out the contract verbatim, and alleged it to have been jointly
executed, its execution was admitted as to both defendants.
There is nothing in these decisions which goes to show that
the plaintiff, notwithstanding anything in the language of the
rule of court invoked, could not prove that the contract was in
fact signed at a date different from that appearing on its face.
The evidence did not go to show that it was not dated January 2 when it was signed, but went to show that, though
dated January 2, it was signed on January 1. It admitted
the -execution of the contract, but tended to avoid it by proving
a fact in regard to it which did not appear on its face, "and
which went to the merits. This was competent evidence, and
was not irrelevant or immaterial. All questions as to surprise,
or as to reopening the case, or as to the order of proof, were
matters of discretion, not reviewable here.
Another written contract was shown to the plaintiff, and
"identified by him," and put in evidence by the defendants,
dated Dec. 25,1866. It provided for advances by the defendants
to the plaintiff, and for their acceptance of his drafts, and for his
payment to them of "2- per cent commission for accepting hig

AMES v. QUIMBY.

drafts." On the language of the contract so put in evidence a
question was raised as to whether the commission was to be paid
on all drafts accepted, or only on those which were in excess of
shipments of handles. On his re-direct examination, when first
called, the plaintiff stated, without objection, that he had had a
duplicate of the contract which was destroyed by fire; that
the copy so introduced was not an exact copy of the one be
had, in its reference to the two and a half per cent commission;
that the one he had was made by one of the defendants; that
drafts for handles shipped he -was to pay no commissions on;
and that those for advances before shipments he was to pay
commissions on. He was then asked, "What change was made
in the duplicate which you had?" This question was objected
to by the defendants on the ground that it was incompetent and
irrelevant, "and, there having been no denial of the execution of
this contract as pleaded and given notice of by the defendants,
it is incompetent to vary it by parol." The objection was overruled, and the defendants excepted. The witness answered that
the word "advanced" was inserted after the word "drafts," so
as to read " 21 per cent commission for accepting his drafts advanced." The defendants contend that the evidence went to a
denial of the execution of the contract, and was, therefore, incompetent under the rule of court before referred to. The
remarks before made apply to this point also. The evidence
went to show what the actual written contract between the
parties was. It did not go to show that the defendants' copy
was not actually signed by the parties. The one copy was
as competent evidence of the real contract as the other was.
What the plaintiff had testified to in regard to the contents
of his original of the contract was admitted without objection
and permitted to stand, and no motion was made to strike it
out. The evidence sought by the question objected to only
went to explain the previous evidence.
A question having arisen as to the quality of the handles
furnished to the defendants by the plaintiff in 1867 and 1868,
a witness for the plaintiff was asked as to the quality of the
handles furnished by the plaintiff to the Old Colony Company
in 1867 and 1868. The defendants objected to the question on
the ground that it was irrelevant and incompetent, and not

AMES V. QUIMBY.

[Sup. 0t.

admissible to show the quality of the handles furnished to the
defendants. The plaintiff's counsel then stated that he proposed
to show, in connection with the offered testimony, that the
handles were of the same general quality as those furnished to
the defendants. Thereupon the objection was overruled and
the defendants excepted, and the witness answered that the
quality of the handles sent to the Old Colony Company in
1867 and 1868 was good. Evidence had been given for the
defendants that the quality of the handles furnished by the
plaintiff to the defendants in .1867 and 1868 was inferior to
the quality of those he had furnished in previous years. The
plaintiff subsequently gave evidence tending to show that the
handles furnished by him to the defendants in 1867 and 1868,
and the handles furnished by him to the Old Colony Company
in 1867 and 1868, were of the same kind and quality. After
this evidence was given there was no motion to strike out the
evidence so objected to, or to rule upon its admissibility. The
evidence objected to was admissible.
Alleged errors in the charge to the jury, and in refusals to
charge as requested, are urged by the defendants. As to the
request to charge respecting the right of the defendants, under
the contract of Jan. 27, 1866, to charge the plaintiff back with
the full value of such handles as broke in the process of bending, it is sufficient to say that the record discloses that there
was a settlement between the parties respecting the one hundred and seventy-two dozen handles charged back in 1866 under
that contract, and that there was really no question for the jury
as to those handles. If the charge given, and the refusal to
charge as requested, had the effect to withdraw from the jury
the consideration of the one hundred and seventy-two dozen, it
only effected the result required by the settlement, and worked
no injury to the defendants.
In regard to the refusal to charge that the plaintiff could
recover $1.373- per dozen for only such handles delivered between Oct. 8, 1866, and April 20, 1867, as he had carried out
at that price in his bill of particulars, and to the charge to the
contrary, it is sufficient to say that the bill of particulars is not
in the record, and there is no statement in the bill of exceptions as to its contents; and that when, in the course of the

Oct. 1882.]

AMES v. QUIMBY.

evidence, the claim was made by the plaintiff for $1.371 per
d6zen for the handles delivered between those dates, the defendants objected that there were three items in April, 1867,
carried out in the bill of particulars at $1.25 per dozen, and the
plaintiff then and there claimed that the bill.of particulars contained a mistake in that respect. The charge of the court was,
that while the plaintiff could not recover for any more handles
than his bill of particulars set forth, he was not bound by a
mistake in carrying out the rate or price, but could show what
he was actually to have. We see no error in this, under the
circumstances.
The request made to charge as to the operations of 1868 was
granted, and the instruction given is not open to the objection
that the price for 1868 was fixed by the court and was not left
to the jury to determine.
Although this court reversed the first judgment, and remanded the cause for a new trial, and a new trial has been had,
with a new judgment, the plaintiffs in error now urge, without
having raised the point before, that this court, instead of having awarded a new trial, should have rendered a judgment for
the defendants below on the findings made by the Circuit Court
at the first trial, and that it should now do so. The question
is not open for this court to review on this writ of error the
judgment it rendered on the former writ of error. That judgment has been carried into effect, and the parties who procured it have enjoyed the benefit of it in the new trial they
have had.
Judgment affirmed.
