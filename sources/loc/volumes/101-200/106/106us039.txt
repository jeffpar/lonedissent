APPEAL

M]r. J. Hf. Call in support of the motion.
There was no opposing counsel.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court.

Rule 32 applies only to cases which have been remanded by
a Circuit Court to a State court, or dismissed, under the authority of sect. 5 of the act of March 3, 1875, c. 137. This is an

State court to the Circuit Court. The record shows that a

Motions under this rule should be accompanied by an agreed

will show that the case is one to which the rule is applicable.
Motion denied.
