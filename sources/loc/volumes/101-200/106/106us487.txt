BROWN.

pany become a party to this suit? But even if the charter did
expire, the road was finished and in possession of the Atlantic
and Gulf Railroad Company in 1870, and the entire transaction
was then completed. The conveyance executed in 1876 was
merely carrying out in form what was already completed and
carried out in substance. But how can this objection avail
the appellants in any view of the case? What right have they
to object to the conveyance? Its only purpose was to carry
out what they and all the parties concerned consented to and
acquiesced in long before. And in their position, as stockholders of the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad Company, it does not
lie in their mouths to object that the South Georgia and Florida
Railroad Company unlawfully exercised corporate powers, when
it completed the performance of its obligation to the Atlantic
and Gulf Railroad Company.
But it is unnecessary to pursue the subject further. We see
nothing in the points raised on the appeal to invalidate the
decree of the Circuit Court.
-Decreeaffirmed.

PARKERSBURG V. BROWN.
1. The act of the legislature of West Virginia, of Dec. 15, 1868, c. 118, authorizing the city of Parkersburg to issue its bonds for the purpose of lending the same to persons engaged in manufacturing, is invalid, and the bonds
issued under it are, as against the city, void.
2. As the consideration for bonds to the amount of 5'20,000, issued by the city
to Al., under that act, he, to secure the payment to the city of the
semi-annual interest on .$20,000, and of annual instalments on the principal, conveyed to J., as trustee, certain real estate and personal property,
with a power of sale in case of default. The bonds were payable to M.
or order. He indorsed them in blank and sold them to A. and B., who
bought them for value, in good faith. M. paid one instalment of interest
on them to the city. The latter made five payments of interest. It then
took into its possession the property, and refused to make further payments. A suit in equity was instituted by the holders of the bonds against
the city, but was not brought to a hearing for nearly three years. M.,
although a party thereto, made no defence. The bill prayed for a receiver
of the property, but none was applied for; and the city having been allowed

PARKERSBURG V. BROWN.

[Sup. Ct.

to control and manage the property meantime, acted in good faith and
with reasonable discretion, in taking care of it and disposing of some of it.
Held, 1. The bonds are void because the necessary amount to pay them
and the interest thereon was to be raised by taxation, which, not being
for a public object, the Constitution of the State did not authorize, and
the legislature had no power to pass the act. 2. Neither the payment
of interest on the bonds by the city, nor the acts of its officers or
agents in dealing with the property, operate, by way of estoppel, ratification, or otherwise to render the city. liable on the bonds. 3. M. lid
a right to reclaim the property and to call on the city to account for it,
in disaffirmance of the illegal contract, the transaction being merely malur prohibitum, and the city being the principal offender. Such right passed
to the complainants as an incident to the bonds. 4. This court orders a
decree to be entered declaring that the city exceeded its lawful powers
in issuing the bonds, and that they cannot be enforced as its obligations,
and providing for a sale of the remaining property, and for an account,
wherein the city is to be credited with the sums it had in good faith paid
for the acquisition, protection, preservation, and disposition of the property,
and for insurance and taxes, and for interest on the bonds, and to be charged
with what it had received, but not with any sum for loss of, or damage
to, or depreciation of, the property, and ordering the distribution among
the complainants of the net proceeds of the sale and the net, amount of
money, if any, remaining in the hands of the city, received from Al. or from
the sales by it of any of the property.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the

District of West Virginia.
The case is stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr. C. C. Cole and Mr. William A. Cook for the appellant.

Mfr. B. H.Ambler, Mr. William A. Fisher,and 111r. Charles
Marshall, contra.
MR. JusTIcE BLATCHFOD delivered the opinion of the
court.
On the 15th of December, 1868, the legislature of West Virginia passed an act which provided as follows, c. 118: "SECT. 1. That the mayor and council of the city of Parkersburg
are hereby authorized and empowered to issue the bonds of said
city to an amount not exceeding two hundred thousand dollars, for
the purpose of lending the same to manufacturers carrying on business in or near the said city, in the said county of Wood. The aid
bonds shall run twenty years, and bear interest at the rate of six

per centum per annum; and they shall be issued upon the recommendation of the following-named persons, who shall be considered
the trustees of said loan, that is to say: . . . who shall have power

to fill all vacancies that may occur in their number. They shall
have power to make loans of said bonds to good, solvent companies,
or individuals, on the following terms, that is to say: When persons
engaged in manufacturing shall have invested in their business
thirty-five (35) per cent. of the amount proposed to be employed in
the business of manufacturing, clear of all liabilities, to be shown to
said trustees by affidavits of the applicants, or by other satisfactory
evidence, and when such proof is furnished, then said trustees, five
members concurring, may lend to such applicants such amounts of
said bonds as they may deem proper and judicious, not, however,
to exceed sixty-five per cent. of the capital proposed to be used
in manufacturing by tle applicant: Provided,however, when such
loans shall be made, the interest thereon shall be paid by the borrower semi-annually to the treasurer of said city; and five per cent.
of the principal shall be paid annually to the said city by the borrower, to be placed to the account of the sinking fund of said city,
until the several loans are paid in full. The said loans shall be
secured by deed of trust or mortgage on real estate, or by other
satisfactory security, sanctioned by said trustees: And provided,
also, that no bonds shall be issued under this section until a majority of the qualified voters of said city concur in the same, by voting
for or against the same, at an election to be held for that purpose.'
On the 17th of April, 1869, an election was held in the city
of Parkersburg, under authority of an ordinance passed by the
mayor and city council of said city, "upon the proposition to
authorize the said city council to issue bonds of the said city
to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars, to be loaned
to manufacturers under the provisions of said law and said ordinance." At said election 441 votes were cast in favor of said
proposition, and 19 against it.
On the 6th of September, 1870, a communication having
been received by the city council from M. J. O'Brien & Brother
in regard to the erection of a manufacturing establishment and
narine railway within the city limits, it was " resolved- that
the council agree, when the trustees of the improvement loan
certify that the Messrs. O'Brien and Bro. have satisfactorily

PARKERSBURG v. BROWN.

[Sup. Ot.

secured the bonds loaned to them, and complied with the act of
the legislature authorizing the loan of said bonds, that they will
release said parties from city taxation on their property, to the
amount of bonds invested in the same, not exceeding twenty
thousand dollars: Provided, however, the release shall extend
so long as the said property shall be used or operated as a
manufacturing establishment and marine railway, but not in
any event to exceed twenty years."
Nothing further was done on the subject until after section 8
of article 10 of the new Constitution of West Virginia went
into operation on the 22d of August, 1872, which is as follows : "8. No county, city, school district, or municipal corporation, except in cases where such corporations have already authorized their
bonds to be issued, shall hereafter be allowed to become indebted,
in any manner, or for any purpose, to an amount, including existing
indebtedness, in the aggregate exceeding five per centum on the
value of the taxable property therein, to be ascertained by the last
assessment for State and county taxes previous to the incurring of
such indebtedness; nor without, at the same time, providing for
the collection of a direct annual tax sufficient to pay, annually, the
interest on such debt, and the principal thereof within, and not exceeding, thirty-four years: -Provkled, that no debt shall be contracted under this section, unless all questions connected with the
same shall have been first submitted to a vote of the people, and
have received three-fifths of all the votes cast for and against the
same."
On the 22d of April, 1873, the city council adopted the following resolution : "Be it resolved by the mayor and council of the city of Parkersburg, that, in the event of the firm of M. J. O'Brien & Brother
taking from the city a loan of twenty thousand ($20,000) dollars of
its bonds authorized under former resolution, dated September 6th,
1870, for manufacturing purposes, and paying punctually the interest thereon and five per cent. (5) of the principal for sixteen years,
the said firm be released from any further payments and the balance
of said bonds be paid by the city, and the said M. J. O'Brien &
Brother are released from making a marine railway."

PARKERSBURG v. BROWN.

At a meeting of the city council on the 13th of Mfay, 1873,
the trustees of said loan made a report, showing that they had
adopted the following resolution: '-Whereas,
Al. J. O'Brien and W. S. O'Brien, composing the
firm of Al. J. O'Brien & Brother, are desirous of obtaining a loan of
the bonds of the city, under and by authority of an act of the legislature of West Virginia, passed December 15, 1868, for manufacturing purposes, to the amount of $20,000, for the purpose of aiding
them in the erection of a foundry and machine works in the city of
Parkersburg; and whereas, for the purpose of erecting these works,
they have bought of Mrs. Joanna Wait, widow of Walton Wait,
deceased, and also from her as the guardian of Bettie C. Wait, infart heir of Walton Wait, deceased, lot No. 80 in said city of
Parkersburg, on Kanawha Street, being 85 by 170 feet, and have
received a conveyance from her of said lot, both as the widow of
said Walton Wait and as the guardian of said Bettie C. Wait; and
whereas it appears, by a schedule of personal property of said M. J.
O'Brien & Brother, verified by affidavit, and now in the hands of
the city attorney, that said M. J. O'Brien & Brother are the owners
of $15,000 worth of personal property in their works at Volcano,
free of incumbrance, we, therefore, recommend to the city council
of the city of Parkersburg, upon the said M. J. and W. S. O'Brien
and their wives executing a deed of trust to the said city on the
said $15,000 worth of personal property, as well as upon the said
lot No. 80, the city council to take from Mrs. Joanna Wait, or some
one for her, bank stock, with power of attorney to dispose of the
same, or solvent bonds, to the amount of $5,000, as security that
said Joanna Wait, guardian, will obtain from the Circuit Court of
Wood County, within two years, authority to convey to Al. J. and
W. S. O'Brien the said lot No. 80, for and on behalf of said ward,
and when said authority is obtained, and said deed made, said
stock or bonds to be given up, then the city council may deliver to
said M. J. and W. S. O'Brien, upon the deposit of the aforesaid
collaterals, 910,000 of said city bonds; and when said l. J. and
W. S. O'Brien have put a building or buildings on said lot ready
for the roof, costing not less than $8,000 when completed, shown by
bills rendered and authenticated for same to the council, and when
said Joanna Wait, guardian of said Bettie 0. Wait, by the authority
of the said Circuit Court of Wood County, has conveyed for and on
behalf of her said ward the said lot No. 80, free of incumbrance, to
said O'Brien & Brother, or made a further deposit of bank stock or

PARKERSBURG v. BROWN.

[Sup. Ct.

bonds to the amount of $8,000, under the conditions aforesaid, as
security that she will obtain such authority within two years from
the date hereof, and make said conveyance, which shall be held by
said city as security for the payment of said bonds and interest
until said deed is made by authority of said court then said, city
council may deliver to said ]M. J. O'Brien & Brother the remaining
$10,000 of said bonds; and said city council shall take, as a further
security for the payment of said bonds and interest, from said M. J.,
O'Brien & Brother, to be deposited with the city treasurer, their
insurance policies, amounting to $14,500, transferred to the said
city, on their machinery, stock, &c., at Volcano; and when their
buildings on said lot are completed, and the machinery thereon
erected, then the said M. J. O'Brien & Brother shall have the
whole insured to the amount of $15,000, and keep the same so insured for the benefit and security of said city on account of' said
loan.'
At the same time the city attorney presented to the council
a trust deed executed by "said O'Brien & Brother," which
was accepted, and it was resolved "that, upon the execution
of the trust by M. J. O'Brien & Bro., the clerk is authorized
to issue immediately $10,000, part of city bonds, as agreed
upon by the resolution of the 22dof April, 1878."
The trust deed, which was executed by the two O'Briens
and their wives, and acknowledged by them on the 13th of
May, 1873, and recorded on the 18th of June, 1873, is in these
words

-

"This deed, made the thirteenth day of May, A. D. 1873, by M.
J. O'Brien and P. F. O'Brien, his wife, and W. S. O'Brien and Jane
C. C. O'Brien, his wife, parties of the first-part, and Okey Johnson,
trustee, party of the second part, witnesseth: That for and in consideration of one dollar in hand paid by the said trustee to the parties of the first part, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged,
the said parties of the first part hereby grant unto the party of the
second part all, &c., of the following property, to wit: All that certain lot of ground situate on Kanawha Street, in the city of Parkersburg;known, as lot No. 80 on the plat of,said town, and being the
same lot: conveyed by Joanna hi: Wait, guardian of Betty C. Wait,
and Joanna. M. Wait in her own right, to the said parties of the
first part by,deed dated the twelfth day of,May, 1873, and all the
personal property mentioned in Schedule A, and hereunto annexed

Oct. 1882.]

PARKERSBURG V. BROWN.

and made part and parcel of this deed, said property now situated
at Volcano, in the county of Wood, and valued at fifteen thousand
and forty.j dollars, which said last-named property is permitted
to remain in the possession of the parties of the first part, and to
be removed from Volcano aforesaid and placed in the building or
buildings to be erected by said parties on the lot aforesaid, until
the same shall be required by the party of the second part, upon
being made as hereinafter specified, that is to say: Whereas an act
passed December 15, 1868, by the legislature of West Virginia, authorizing the mayor and city council of the city of Parkersburg to
lend its bonds for manufacturing purposes, to which act reference
may be had for a more explicit understanding of the provisions;
and whereas the parties of the first part have negotiated with the
said city for a loan of its bonds to the amount of twenty thousand
dollars, according to the provisions set forth in an ordinance passed
by the said city council the twenty-second day of April, 1873,
whereby it is, among other things, provided that if the parties of
the first part shall punctually pay the interest on the aforesaid sum
of twenty thousand dollars, and five per centum of the principal for
sixteen years, the said parties of the first part shall be released from
any further payment, which said ordinance was authorized under a
former ordinance, dated September 6. 1870, to both of which ordinances reference may be had for a fuller understanding thereof, and
are made part hereof, which negotiation for the aforesaid loan of
$20,000 of the bonds of the said city is made on the part of said
city pursuant to a recommendation in writing made by the trustees
of said loan, as provided in said act of the legislature, to which
recommendation in writing reference may be had for a fuller understanding thereof, and is made part hereof, in trust to secure the
faithful performance by the parties of the first part, in their payment
of the aforesaid interest on said twenty thousand dollars, and the
payment of the five per centum of the principal, as specified in the
aforesaid ordinance passed the twenty-second day of April, 1873.
And if any default shall be made herein, then the party of the
second part, as trustee aforesaid, shall proceed to sell the property
hereby conveyed, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 72 of the
Code of West Virginia, and the acts amendatory thereto."
Exhibit A, annexed to the trust deed, contained a list by
items of the personal property, with a valuation opposite each
item, the same being principally machinery and tools. Attached to it was an affidavit made by M. J. O'Brien, setting

PARKERSBURG V. BROWN.

[Sup. ot.

forth that M. J. O'Brien & Brother owned all the property
free of incumbrance, and that each item was worth the sum
set down opposite to it, and that the whole was then worth
$15,000.
On the 10th of June, 1873, an order was adopted by the
council, reciting the statute, and the election, and the prior
proceedings of the trustees of the loan and of the council, and
the presentation of the deed of trust and the deposit of the
$5,000 security, and of the insurance policies before provided
for, and then ordered that the said security was satisfactory,
and that $10,000 of the bonds of the city be delivered to
M. J. O'Brien & Brother "forthwith, under the conditions of
and in accordance with" the said act "and the orders made
September 6, 1870, and April 22, 1873, made and intended to
be made by authority of said act of legislature, and to be controlled by and construed according to its provisions," and further ordered that when Mrs. Wait should make the deed to lot
No. 80, the $5,000 security should be given up.
Thereupon $10,000 of the bonds were delivered to the
O'Briens. Each bond was a certificate of indebtedness for
$500, payable to M. J. O'Brien & Brother, or order, dated
June 1, 1873, sealed with the seal of the city and signed by
the mayor and the clerk, payable June 1, 1893, at Parkersburg, with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum, payable semi-annually, June I and December 1, in the city of
New York. Coupons payable to bearer for each payment of
interest were attached. Each bond contained this statement:
"This certificate is issued by authority of the act of the General Assembly of the State of West Virginia, passed December
15, 1868."
On the 9th of September, 1873, the city council passed the
following order : "It appearing to the satisfaction of the council that M. J. O'Brien
& Brother have their buildings, which, when completed, will cost
more than eight thousand dollars, now up and ready to be roofed,
and have therefore complied with the recommendation of the manufacturers' loan, and the former orders of the council in that respect,
'it is ordered that as soon as Mrs. Joanna Wait, or some one for
her, shall deposit with the city treasurer bonds to the amoun.t of

Oct. 1882.]

O 2ARKERSBURG v. BROWN.

$8,000, or bank stock, with power of attorney to dispose of the
same, as collateral security that she will obtain within two years
from the 13th of May, 1873, the authority from the Circuit Court
of Wood County to make for and on behalf of her ward, Bettie C.
Wait, a deed to said M. J. O'Brien & Brother, for lot No. 80 in the
city of Parkersburg, that the mayor of the city of Parkersburg is
directed to deliver, properly signed by himself and attested by the
clerk of the council, the remaining ($10,000) ten thousand dollars
of the bonds of the city of Parkersburg, as provided for by former
orders of this council."
The second lot of $10,000 of the bonds were thereupon issued to M. J. O'Brien & Brother, the bonds being in the same
form as the others. No other proceedings of the city council
appear as to the issuing of the bonds.
The bonds were all of them indorsed in blank by M. J.
O'Brien & Brother, and were sold by them at eighty cents on
the dollar, $10,000 in June, 1873, and %10,000 in September,
1873. The appellees are the owners of the entire $20,000 of
bonds, and are bona fide holders of them. The O'Briens paid
to the city the $600 of interest falling due Dec. 1, 1873, and
the city paid the coupons due that day. The O'Briens paid
no more. The city paid the coupons which fell due in June
and in December, 1874, and in June and December, 1875. It
paid no more.
The coupons which fell due June 1 and Dec. 1, 1876, not
having been paid, the plaintiff, Isabella Brown, owning ,5,000
of the bonds, filed this bill on behalf of herself and all other
holders of the bonds who should unite in the suit, setting forth
the said act of December, 1868, the election, the action of the
trustees of the loan and of the city council, the giving of the
security, the execution and recording of the deed of trust, and
the issuing of the first 810,000 of bonds. Her $5,000 of bonds
are part of those bonds. The bill sets forth the proceeding
for the issuing of the rest of the bonds and their actual issue.
It avers that the holders of all of the bonds are bonafide holders
for value. The defendants in the suit are the city of Parkersburg, the two O'Briens and their wives, and the assignee in
bankruptcy of the O'Briens.
In November, 1873, the O'Briens-and their wives executed

PARKERSBURG v. BROWN.

[Sup. Ct.

to said Johnson a deed for said lot No. 80 and for another lot,
in trust to secure one Leach for his indorsement of a promissory
note of the O'Briens for $3,000, with power to sell the land in
case, the note should not be paid. On the 9th of November,
1874, Johnson sold lot No. 80 and its appurtenances at auction,
under said last-named trust deed, to the city of Parkersburg,
and, on the 8th of December, 1874, executed to the city a deed
of it, which recited that the sale of the lot was "subject to a
trust thereon in favor of the city of Parkersburg for $20,000,"
and that the sale was for $300, and conveyed the lot and its
buildings and appurtenances to the city "subject to the lien
of the said city aforesaid."
The bill sets forth said sale and conveyance, and avers that
the city has, since said purchase, claimed said real estate as
being its property, and has rented it, and is now claiming it
and exercising to some extent rights of ownership over it;
that after the deed from the O'Briens to Johnson was executed
they were adjudged bankrupt, and their assignee in bankruptcy
was permitted, without objection on the part of the city, to
take possession of the movable tools and machinery covered by
said deed; that said chattels were sold by said assignee to various purchasers, and became scattered and deteriorated in value;
that some were sold subject to the claim of the city, and others
without such reservation; that the city continued to pay the
interest on the bonds until the maturity of the coupons which
became due June 1, 1876, when it refused to pay them, and
has paid no more and refuses to recognize the obligations of
the, bonds and coupons, on the ground that they were issued
by the city without lawful authority; and that the city has
neglected the real estate and the improvements and fixed machinery on it, and the buildings are unoccupied and unprotected, lying open to the weather and to depredations, and no
care is used in protecting the buildings and machinery, and
many valuable parts of the machinery have thus been lost.
The bill alleges that the deed of trust to the city was executed
for the purpose of securing the holders of the bonds and coupons, and :they are the parties beneficially interested in the
same, and the city is a trustee of all the property mentioned
in the deed, for the holders of the bonds; that the city was

Oct. 1882.]

PARKERSBURG

v.

BROWN.

bound to care for the property and protect the title to i,
for the benefit of the cestuis que trust, and especially as it had
induced them to purchase the bonds, as well in reliance on the
deed as on the credit of the city; that the city was, as trustee,
bound to interpose to prevent the sale of the chattels by the
assignee in bankruptcy, and to place the property in the charge
of a responsible custodian, and protect it from depredation, and
that, in failing to exercise such care and in permitting such
sale, the city has violated the duties assumed by it from its
acceptance of the deed, and has become liable to account to
the holders of the bonds for all the loss and injury which have
occurred to said real estate and chattels by reason of such neglect; and that the owners of the bonds are entitled to the interposition of a court of equity for the care and protection of
the property, and to a decree for the sale of such of it as remains upon the premises mentioned in the deed to the city,
and for the sale of the real estate, and to a decree against the
city requiring it to account for and pay over to the holders of
the bonds all such moneys as have been lost to them from such
neglect, and to pay to them any balance which may remain
due to them after applying all sums which may result from
such sales and accounting. The prayer of the bill, as originally filed, is for the appointment of a receiver to take charge
of the property, and the appointment of a trustee to make sale
of it, and the distribution of the proceeds of sale among the
owners of the bonds and coupons, and that the city account for
and pay over to them the value of the chattels so lost or sold,
and for such loss as has resulted by reason of such neglect of
duty on the part of the -city in the care of the property,.and
the rents and profits received by the city from the property,
and that the city and the O'Briens pay to the owners of the
bonds any deficiency in the principal and interest thereof
which may remain after the payment of the sums resulting
from the sales and accounting aforesaid.
The city answered the bill, setting up various defences.
One is that a majority of the qualified voters of the city did
not vote at said election in favor of authorizing the issuing of
bonds under the act of 1868. Another is that the voters voted
on the question of authorizing the issue of bonds generally
VOL. XVI.

32

PARKERSBURG V. BROWN.

[Sup. Ct.

,Vnder the act, and not on the question of issuing the particular
bonds. Another is that the issuing of said bonds had not been
authorized prior to the 22d of August, 1872, when said section
8 of article 10 of the new Constitution of West Virginia became
operative; that said section governed in the issuing of said
bonds; and that they were issued in violation thereof, in that
the payment thereof was not provided for at the time of the
issuing thereof, as required by said section, and all questions
connected with the same were not first submitted to a vote of
the people, as therein required, and said bonds are void. Another is that the act of 1868 was in violation of the Constitution of the State. Another is that at the time of the passage
of said act the city had, and now has, no property out of which
it could pay any such bonds, except such funds as it is or may
be authorized by law to raise by taxation. Another is that
the bonds were issued in aid of a private enterprise, for individual profit, and not for a public purpose; that it is in excess
of the constitutional power of the legislature of the State to
authorize taxation for the purpose of paying said bonds, unless
that power was clearly conferred on it by the Constitution of
the State; that no such power was conferred on it by the Constitution of the State in force at the time of the passage of said
act or the one now in force; that the said act is void for want
of power in the legislature to pass it; and that the bonds issued
under it are void. Another is that the bonds are void because
they were issued in violation of section 9 of article 10 of the
Constitution of the State in force at the time they were issued,
which provides that the legislature may, by law, authorize the
corporate authorities of cities to assess and collect taxes for
corporate purposes; that said provision amounts to a prohibition against assessing and collecting taxes for any other than a
corporate purpose; and that said bonds, being issued for a private and not for a corporate purpose, are void. The answer
alleges that if any property covered by the deed of trust was
sold by the assignee in bankruptcy, it was sold by him subject
to said deed of trust. It denies the allegations of the bill as to
the neglect of the city to protect and care for the buildings and
machinery. It avers that it is not chargeable with the care of
the property, but that it has taken as good care of the same as

Oct. 1882.]

PARKERSBURG v. BROWN.

was possible under the circumstances, and has used all duej
diligence to rent it. It denies that the deed of trust was executed to secure the holders of the bonds and coupons, and denies
that the city was or is a trustee for them of the property covered by the deed, ad denies that it induced any person to take
the bonds. It avers that it is not competent for the city to act
as trustee in such a matter, wholly foreign to the purpose of its
creation; that it has paid out, as interest on the bonds and expenses attending the issuing of them, and taxes on the property,
more than it has received from all sources on account of the
property; and that the complainant has a plain and adequate
remedy in a court of law. It denies the right of the complainant to any decree against it for any sum in any event, whether
the court shall deem the complainant entitled to a sale of the
property mentioned in the deed of trust or otherwise. Finally,
the answer says that if the court shall be of opinion that it
has any jurisdiction in the premises, or that the complainant is
entitled to resort to the property for the payment of the bonds
or the interest thereon, the city is willing to submit to any
order to be made by the court in relation to the disposition of
the property, upon the court pronouncing the bonds void and
the city not liable on account thereof, but it prays that in any
order to be made the city may be decreed to receive out of the
proceeds of any sale of the property the sum it has so expended
above its receipts.
The bill was taken as confessed as to all the defendants except the city. The holders of all the bonds were made parties
complainant. Proofs were taken on both sides. The bill was
then amended so as to aver also that the city is estopped, by
her conduct, to deny the validity of her indebtedness according
to the tenor and effect of the bonds and coupons, and so as to
add to the prayer for relief the following: " Or that the said
city of Parkersburg may be decreed to pay the said bonds and
coupons according to the tenor thereof, and especially that a
decree may be passed for the payment of the overdue coupons
upon the said bonds." The bill was further amended so as to
allege that even if the city was not chargeable as trustee from
the time of the execution of the deed of trust, it is chargeable
with all the duties and liabilities of a trustee, in regard to all

[Sup. Or.

of the property, from the respective times at which it actually
took possession of the same; and the grantee in the deed of
trust was made a defendant and appeared. The case was
brought to a hearing, and a decree was made, which states that
the court is of opinion that the city is indebted for the bonds
and coupons and is responsible for their payment according to
their tenor and effect, that the $20,000 of bonds are held by
the several complainants in amounts severally specified, and
that there are due to them severally certain specified sums for
interest coupons due and unpaid upon the bonds (being interest from and including June 1, 1876, to and including June 1,
1879), with interest from the date of the decree; and then decrees that the complainants are entitled to have the bonds held
by them respectively paid by the city at the maturity of the
same, with interest payable at the times and in the manner
stated in the interest coupons attached to the bonds, and that
the complainants respectively recover against the city for the
several sums so set out as due for interest on the bonds, and
interest on the same from the date of the decree, and costs,
and have execution therefor. From this decree the city has
appealed to this court.
The bill, as filed, asked for equitable relief, and sought to
charge the city as a trustee and to reach the property covered
by the deed of trust. The relief granted by the decree was
a simple money judgment against the city, for the interest due
on the bonds at the date of the decree, based on the legal liability of the city to pay the bonds and coupons. For this there
was a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law, in each
bondholder, if the city was thus liable. So that the decree
made could not be sustained in any event.
But we are of opinion that, within the principles decided by
this court in the case of Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall.
655, the bonds in question here are void. The act of 1868
authorizes the bonds to be issued as the bonds of the city.
The principal and interest are to be paid by the city. The
bonds are to be lent to persons engaged in manufacturing.
Those persons are to pay the interest on the "loans" semi-annually to the treasurer of the city, and are also to pay annually
to the city five per cent of the principal, to go into the sinking

fund of the city, till the "loans" are paid in full: No fund is
provided or designated out of which the city is to pay the principal or interest of the bonds. What the "borrower," as" the
act calls him, is to so pay to the city is not such a fund. The
city is to pay the principal and interest of the bonds, according
to their tenor, whether the "borrower" pays the city or not.
No other source of payment being provided for the city, the
implication is that the city is to raise the necessary amount by
taxation. It has, by sect. 15 of the act of March 17, 1860,
authority to levy and collect an annual tax on the real estate
and personal property and tithables in the city, and upon all
other subjects of taxation under the revenue laws of the State,
which taxes are to be for the use of the city. A legitimate
use of the moneys so raised by taxation is to pay the debts of
the city. Taxation to pay the bonds in question is not taxation for a public object. It is taxation which takes the private
property of one person for the private use of another person.
There is, in the act of 1860, a provision that the tax shall not
exceed a given percentage of the assessed value of the property
or so much on every tithable, but it does not appear that a tax
for these bonds would exceed the limit. Therefore, the inference that it was intended, by the act of 1868, that such taxation as should be necessary to pay the bonds should be resorted
to, must remain in full effect. There was no provision in the
Constitution of West Virginia of 1862 authorizing the levying
of taxes to be used to aid private persons in conducting a private
manufacturing business. This being so, the legislature had no
power to enact the act of 1868.
There having been a total want of power to issue the bonds
originally, under any circumstances, and not a mere failure to
comply with prescribed requirements or conditions, the case
is not one for applying to the city, under any state of facts,
any doctrine of estoppel or ratification, by reason of its having
paid some instalments of interest on the bonds (Loan Association v. Topeka, uli supra), or by reason of any of the acts of its
officers or agents in dealing with the property covered by the
deed of trust. No such acts can give validity to the statute or
to the bonds, however they may affect the status of the property dealt with or the relation of the city to such property.

PARKERSBURG V. BROWN.

[Sup. Ot.

But it is contended by the appellees that, independently of
the original validity of the bonds, the city is liable to pay
theni, because it misled and prejudiced their holders, and prevented them from resorting to the security, or because it received the full value of the bonds in consideration of paying
them. It is urged that if the bonds were void the city had no
right to meddle with the security. There has, however, never
been any impediment to a resort by the holders of the bonds to
proceedings to have the property covered by the deed of trust
administered for and appropriated to their benefit, as representing the O'Briens in respect to such property, and as subrogated
to the rights of the O'Briens to have the property devoted to
the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds, in view
of their being void. The only misleading or prejudice was
that the holders of the bonds, mistaking the law, supposed
them to be valid obligations of the city. As to the receipt of
property by the city, it received certain property, but it did
not thereby enter into any obligation, even if it could have
done so, to pay these bonds. The evidence shows that the city
has endeavored, in a proper way and with a due regard to the
interests of the O'Briens and of those interested under the
O'Briens, to preserve and protect the property and realize from
it as much as could be realized. The bill in this case was filed
in December; 1876. The case was heard in September, 1879.
The bill prayed for a receiver of the property, yet none was appointed or applied for, so far as appears. The sales by the
city of movable property, which are complained of, took place
after this suit was brought. The plaintiffs have chosen to
leave all the property in the bands of the city up to this time.
The city has acted in good faith, and with reasonable discretion, in regard to the property, throughout. No valuation
placed upon the property, real or personal, or any part of it, by
way of estimate or opinion, at the time the city took possession
of it, or at any time since, can be taken, on the evidence in this
case, as the measure of any liability of the city on the bonds
or in respect of the property. Neither the O'Briens nor the
plaintiffs interposed to control the property, but left the city to
control and manage it. There are not about the acts of the
city, in regard to the property, any elements which can consti-

PARKERSBURG V. BROWN.

tute the city a trustee of the property, with the duties imposed
on a trustee. No trust arose in favor of the plaintiffs out of
the deed of trust to Johnson. The trust thereby created was
one to secure the payment by the O'Briens to the city of the
interest on $20,000 and of the .principal of that sum. The
plaintiffs could not enforce that trust in the place of the city.
It was a void trust, because the consideration of it was the
issuing of the void bonds. Nor did the purchase by the city of
the property which it bought subject to the trust validate the
original trust or create a new one.
But, notwithstanding the invalidity of the bonds and of the
trust, the O'Briens had a right to reclaim the property and to
call on the city to account for it. The enforcement of such
right is not in affirmance of the illegal contract, but is in disaffirmance of it, and seeks to prevent the city from retaining the
benefit which it has derived from the unlawful act. 2 Com.
Cont. 109. There was no illegality in the mere putting of the
property by the O'Briens in the hands of the city. To deny a
remedy to reclaim it is to give effect to the illegal contract.
The illegality of that contract does not arise from any moral
turpitude. The property was transferred under a contract
which was merely malum protdbitum, and where the city was
the principal offender. In such a case the party receiving may
be made to refund to the person from whom it has received
property for the unauthorized purpose, the value of that which
it has actually received. White v. Franklin Bank, 22 Pick.
(Mass.) 181; .Zt3orville v. American Tract Society, 123 Mass.
129; Davis v. Old Colony Railroad, 131 id. 258, 275; and
cases there cited. The O'Briens having indorsed and sold the
bonds, the holders of the bonds succeeded to such right of the
O'Briens, as an incident to the ownership of the bonds. The
O'Briens suffered the city to take possession of and administer
the property. They were made parties to this suit originally,
and have made no defence to it. The right which the plaintiffs so have to call on the city to render an account of the
property is one which can be properly adjudicated in this suit
in equity. It involves the taking of an account, the sale under
the direction of the court of what remains of the property, and
the ascertainment of the proper charges to be allowed to the

PARKERSBURG v. BROWN.

[Sup. Ct.

city against the moneys it has received and against the proceeds of sale. There can be no doubt that the city is entitled
to be credited the sums it has paid in good faith to acquire,
protect, preserve, and dispose of the property, and for insurance
and taxes, and the amount it has paid in paying the coupons it
has paid, and that it is to be charged with what it has received.
But it is not to be charged with any sum for loss of or damage
to or depreciation of the property. The remaining property
must be sold under the direction of the court below, and an
account be stated on the foregoing principles, and the net proceeds of the sale and the net amount of money, if any, in the
hands of the city, must be distributed among the plaintiffs.
The decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed, with costs,
and the case be remanded to that court, with instructions to
enter a decree declaring that the city, in issuing the bonds, exceeded its lawful powers, and that they cannot be enforced as
obligations of the city, and providing for a sale of the remaining
property, real and personal, under the direction of the court,
and the taking of an account between the city and the property, on the basis stated in this opinion, and the application, in
conformity with this opinion, of the net proceeds of the sale,
and of the net amount of money, if any, remaining in the hands
of the city, received from the O'Briens, or from the sales by
it of any of the property received by it, and for such further
proceedings in the case as may be in conformity with this
opinion.
We have not deemed it necessary to consider the question
whether the bonds were void as having been issued in violation
of section 8 of article 10 of the Constitution of West Virginia
of. 1872, or the question whether the act of 1868 required a
vote by the voters of the city on each loan of bonds to be made,
or the question whether the act of 1868 was observed in other
respects, in issuing the bonds.
JDecree reversed.
