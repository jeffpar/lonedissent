UTAH & NORTHERN RAILWAY. v. FISHER.
APPEAL FROM THE SU'REME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF IDAHO.
Submitted October 21, 1885.-Decided December 14, 1885

The Fort Hill Indian reservation in the County of Oneida, in the Territory of
Idaho, is not excluded from the limits of the Territory by the act of March
3, 1863, creating it ; and the treaty of July 3, 1868, with the eastern band
of Shoshonees and the Bannack tribe does not necessarily except it from the
jurisdiction of the Territory.
The lands and railroad of the Utah & Nortiern Railway Company situated
within the limits of the Fort Hill Indian I-Cservqtion are subject to territorial taxation, which may be enforced within the exterior boundaries of
the reservation by proper process.

The facts which make the case are stated in the opinion of
the court.

delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff became a corporation of Utah under an act of
the Territory of February 12, 1869, for the incorporation of

railroad companies; and by the act of Congress of June 20,
1878, it was made a railway corporation, not only of that Territory, but of Idaho and Montana also, with the same rights
and privileges it had under its original articles of incorpora-

tion, with a proviso, however, that it should thereafter be subject to all laws and regulations in relation to railroads of the
United States, or of any Territory or State through which it
might pass. 20 Stat. ch. 242, ยง 2. It now owns and operates
in Idaho a railroad, which, for the distance of sixty-nine miles
and a fraction of a mile, passes through a tract of land in the
county of Oneida, known as the Fort Hill Indian Reservation,
which was, on the 30th of July, 1869, set apart by order of the
President for the Bannack tribe of Indians, pursuant to the
provisions of a treaty between the United States and the Eastern Band of Shoshonees and the lBannack tribe, concluded
July 3, 1808. 15 Stat. 673.
In 1882 there was levied under the laws of the Territory
upon the railroad, its depots, and other property within the
reservation, for territorial and county purposes, a tax, amountin the aggregate to $4478. The defendant is the assessor and
tax-collector of the county, and the tax having become delinquent, he was proceeding to enforce it by a sale of the property, when the plaintiff commenced this suit in the District
Court of the county to restrain him, contending that the property, being within the boundaries of the Indian reservation, is
withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Territory. A preliminary injunction was granted, but at the hearing the Court held
that the property was subject to taxation, and that the tax
was duly levied. The injunction was accordingly dissolved
and judgment rendered for the defendant. On appeal to the
Supreme Court of the Territory this judgment was affirmed.
The contention of the plaintiff is that the Indian reservation
is excluded from the limits of Idaho by the act of March 3,
1863, creating the Territory, 12 Stat. 808 ; or, that it is necessarily excepted from the jurisdiction of the Territory by the
treaty of July 3, 1868. Neither position can be sustained.
The first section of that act embraces Vithin the boundaries of
the Territory the reservation; and the proviso upon which the
plaintiff relies only declares that nothing shall be construed to
impair the existing rights of the Indians in Idaho, so long as
they shall remain unextinguished by treaty, or to include
within its boundaries or jurisdiction any lands which, by treaty

with the Indian tribes, were not, without their consent, to be
included within the limits or jurisdiction of any State or Territory; or to affect the authority of the government of the
United States to make any regulations respecting the Indians,
their lands, property, or other rights, by treaty, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent for the government
to make if the act had not passed. 12 Stat. 808. The proviso
excludes from the limits and jurisdiction of Idaho only such
lands as by treaty were not to be included without the consent
of the Indians, and it recognizes the authority of the United
States to make the same regulations respecting the lands, property, and other rights of the Indians, which it would have been
competent to make before the passage of the act. There was
at that time no treaty with the Indians that the lands, which
might be reserved to them, should be thus excluded from the
limits and jurisdiction of any State or Territory. The clause
of the proviso on that head has therefore no application.
Harkness v. Hyde, 98 U. S. 476, in which it was held that the
jurisdiction of the Territory did not extend over the reservation, was decided upon the mistaken belief that such a treaty
existed, and that to it the proviso referred. This error was
corrected in Zangford v. .tonleith, 102 U. S. 145, 147. As no
such treaty existed, the proviso did not exclude the reservation
from the limits or the jurisdiction of the Territory.
By the treaty it was agreed that whenever the Bannacks desired a reservation to be set apart for their use, or the President deemed it advisable to put them upon a reservation, he
should cause a suitable one to be selected in their country. It
was under this agreement that the Fort Hill Reservation was
subsequently established and the Bannacks placed upon it.
The treaty provided a reservation for the Shoshonees, and declared that they should enjoy various rights and privileges, and
that the Bannacks, -when their reservation was made, should
have the same rights and privileges therein. Among other
things, it was stipulated that the reservations should be set
apart for their absolute and undisturbed use and occupation,
and for such other friendly tribes or individual Indians to
whose admission from time to time they and the United States

might consent, and that no person should ever be permitted
by the United States to pass through, settle upon, or reside on
the reservation, except those designated in the treaty, and such
officers, agents, "and employees of the government as might be
authorized to enter therein in the discharge of duties enjoined by
law. The treaty also provided for the punishment, according to
the laws of the United States, of any person among the Indians
who should commit a wrong or depredation upon the person or
property of any one, white, black, or Indian, subject to the authority of the United States, and at peace therewith; and that
no treaty for the cession of any portion of the reservation held
in common should be of any force or validity as against the
Indians, unless executed and signed by a majority of the adult
male Indians occupying or interested therein; and that no cession should be construed to deprive, without his consent, any
member of the tribe of his right to land selected by him under
the treaty.
It is contended by the plaintiff that these stipulations cannot
be carried out, if the laws of the Territory are enforced on the
reservation; and in support of the position special emphasis is
placed upon the clause in regard to persons passing over, setling upon, or residing in the Territory, and the clause touching
wrong-doers among the Indians. As these treaty provisions
have the force and effect of a law, it is insisted that the reservation is excluded from the general jurisdiction of the Territory,
as effectually as if the exclusion was made in specific terms.
To uphold that jurisdiction in all cases and to the fullest extent woild -undoubtedly interfere with the enforcement of the
treaty stipulations, and might thus defeat provisions designed
for the security of the Indians. But it is not necessary to insist
upon such general jurisdiction for the Indians to enjoy the full
benefit of the stipulations for their protection. The authority
of the Territory may rightfully extend to all matters not interfering with that protection. It has, therefore, been held that
process of its courts may run into an Indian reservation of this
kind, where the subject-matter or controversy is otherwise
within their cognizance. If the plaintiff lawfully constructed
and now operates a railroad through the reservation, it is not

perceived that any just rights of the Indians under the treaty
can be impaired by taxing the road and property used in
operating it. The authority to construct and operate the road
appears from the agreement of July 18, 1881, between the
United States and the Indians, which Was ratified by act of
Congress of July 3, 1882. That agreement recites that the
Utah and Northern Railway Company had applied for permission to construct a line of railway through the reservation, and
that the Indians had agreed, for the consideration thereafter
mentioned, to surrender to the United States their title to so
much of the reservation as might be necessary for the legitimate and practical uses of the road. A strip of land and
several parcels adjoining it, forming part of the reservation,
were ceded to the United States for the consideration of
$6000, to be used by the company and its successors or assigns
as a right of way and road-bed, and for depots, stations, and
other structures. By an act of Congress confirmatory of the
agreement the same right of way was relinquished by the
United States to the company for the construction of its road;
and the use of the several parcels of land intended for depots,
stations, and other structures was granted to the company
and its successors or assigns, upon the payment to the United
States of the $6000; and on the condition of paying any
damages which the United States or Indians, individuals or
in their tribal capacity, might sustain, by reason of the acts
of the company, or its agents or employees, or on account of
fires originating in the construction or operation of the road..
By force of the cession thus made, the land upon which the
railroad and other property of the plaintiff are situate' ,as, so
far as necessary for the construction and working of the ocad,
and the construction and use of buildings connected therewith,
withdrawn from the reservation. The road and property
thereupon became subject to the laws of the Territory relating
to railroads, as if the reservation had never existed. The very
terms on which the plaintiff became a corporation in the Territory rendered it subject to all such laws, and, of course, to those
by which the tax in controversy was imposed.
The only answer of the plaintiff to this view is, that, by the

Syllabus.

stipulation of the parties and the finding of the court thereon,
it appears that the railway and property which are taxed, are
situated within the boundaries of and upon the reservation. If
this be so, it does not follow that the result would be changed.
The moment that the road was lawfully constructed it came
under the operation of the laws of the Territory. The stipulation and finding must, however, be read with reference to the
legislation of Congress, and, therefore, as only establishing
that the road and property are within the exterior boundaries
of the reservation. They vill not be so construed as to
allow the company to escape taxation by the force of a stipulation as to an alleged fact which that legislation shows does not
exist.
Judgment affirmed.

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUTT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
Argued November 24, 25, 1885.-Declded December 14, 1885.
A married woman who, on being informed of a contract made by her husband
for the sale of an equitable interest in real estate held by her in her own
right, repudiates it, and who. for more than two years, refuses to perform
it whenever thereto requested, during which time the property depreciates
greatly in value, cannot, after the expiration of that time, enforce in equity
the specific performance of the contract by the other party.
When the husband of a married woman obtains a decree of foreclosure of a
mortgage held by him as her trustee, and at the sale purchases the property and takes a deed in his own name. she retains an equitable interest
therein, as against a purchaser from the husband with actual notice.
A loaned B a sum of money on a conveyance of a tract of land, the equitable
interest in which belonged, as A knew at the time, to B's wife. He further agreed with B to acquire an outstanding tax title of the property, and
subsequently complied with that agreement. Simultaneously by a separate instrument, they agreed that A, on payment of a further sum, might,
at his election, acquire the whole title of B and wife, to be conveyed by
warranty deed executed by both ; or, if A so elected, B should repay the
sum loaned and the amount paid for the tax-title, A holding the premises as
