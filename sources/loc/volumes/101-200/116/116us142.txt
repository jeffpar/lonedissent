HEWITT v. FILBERT & Another.
.APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Submitted December 7, 1885.-Decided December 21, 1885.

Except in cases of appeals allowed in open court during the term at which the
decree appealed from was rendered, a citation returnable at the same term
with the appeal or writ of error is necessary to perfect the jurisdiction of
this court over the appeal or the writ, unless it sufficiently appears that
citation has been waived.
-This court has no jurisdiction to issue citation in an appeal docketed here after
the term to which the appeal was returnable.

This was a motion to dismiss an appeal. The facts which

This is. a motion to dismiss an appeal for want of a citation.
The facts are these: A decree was entered by the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia on the 21st of November,
I1882,.disinissing
the bill in a suit between Robert C. Hewitt,
complainant, tnd Lewis S. Filbert and others, defendants. On
th6 same day an appeal was allowed in open court, but that
appeal was never docketed' in this court by the appellant. It
was, however, docketed by the appellee, and dismissed under
Rule 9, on the 15th of October, 1883, but the mandate was not

sent down until M/arch 25, 1885. In the meantime, on the
26th of June, 1884, Hewitt appeared in the Supreme Court of
the District, at general term, and, on his ex 2arte application,
an order was entered allowing him a second appeal upon his
giving security in the sum of five hundred dollars. After the
close of the term at which this order was made, and on the
18th of August, a bond was approved by one of the justices
and filed in the office of the clerk of that court. The case was
dooketed in this court on the 20th of August, 1884, but no citation has ever been issued or served.
Except in cases of appeals allowed in openi court during thq
term at which the decree appealed from was rendered, a citation returnable at the same term with the appeal or writ of'
error, is necessary to perfect our jurisdiction of the appeal or
the writ, unless it has been in some proper form waived. 7we

In Dayton v. Laek, 94 U. S. 112, it was held that, if a citation was acttially issued but not served, before the first day of
the term to which it was returnable, leave might be granted to
make the service during that term. In this way the language
of the court in VFillabolos v. United States, and United State
v. Curry, which seemed to require service as well as issue of
the citation before the return day of the appeal or writ of
error was to some extent qualified, but the authority of those
cases as to the necessity of an actual issue of the citation and
service before the end of the return term was in no way impaired. On the contiary, it was fully recognized. So in Rairoad Co. v. Blair, 100 U. S. 661, where an appeal was allowed
in open court at a term subsequent to that in which the decree
appealed from was rendered, but when the solicitors of the appellee were present and had actual notice of what was done,
leave was granted to issue a citation and have it served during
the return term of the appeal.
Appeals allowed by the court in session, and acting judicially
at the term when the decree was rendered, have always been

given a different effect' from appeals allowed after the term or
writs of-error. Thus, in Reily v. Lamar, 2 Cranch, 344; 349,
decided in 1805, only two years after the at allowing appeals โข
in cases of-equity and admiralty and maritime jurisdiction was
passed, 2. Stat. 244, ch. 40, ยง 2, it was stated by Chief Justice
:Marshall "to, be the opinion of the court that, the appeal
having been prayed pending the court below, a citation was
not necessary; and, therefore, the case was properly before the
court" without a citation.
It.
has since been decided that if the appeal is allowed in
open court at the term, but the appeal bond is not accepted
until after the term, a citation will be necessary to bring in the
parties. Sage v. Railroad Co., 96 U. S.7192, 115. But if an
appeal allowed in such a way is docketed in this court at the
return term, our jurisdiction of the appeal becomes perfect, and
what remains to be done to get in the parties is matter of procedure only, and not jurisdictional, so far as the bringing of the
appeal is conceirned. Dodge v. E.nowles, 114 U. S. 430, 438.
As was said in that case: "The judicial allowance of an appeal
in open court, at the term in which the decree has been
rendered, is sufficient notice of the taking of an appeal.
Security is only for the due prosecution of the appeal. The
citation, if security is taken out of court or after the term, is
only necessary to show that the appeal which was allowed in
term has not been abandoned, by the failure- to furnish the
security before the adjournment. It is not jurisdictional. Its
bnly purpose is notice. If by accident it has been omitted, a
motion to dismiss an appeal, allowed in open court and at the
proper term, will never be granted until an opportunity to give
the requisite notice has been furnished, and this, whether the
motion was made aft6r the expiration of two -years from the
rendition of the decree, or before." The reason of this is, that
the allowance by the court in session before the end of the
term at which the decree was rendered, and when both parties
are either actually or constructively present, is in the nature of
an adjudication of appeal which, if docketed here in time, gives
tfiis court jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the appeal, with
power to make all such orders, consistent with the practice of

Syllabus.

courts of equity, as may be appropriate and necessary for the
furtherance of justice. In legal effect, the judicial allowance of
an appeal in this way transfers the cause to this court, if the
appellant dockets the appeal here at the proper time. If not
docketed, the appeal which has been allowed becomes inoperative for want of due prosecution. Griqgby v: Purcell, 99 U. S.
505, 506, and cases there cited.
But a citation is one of the necessary elements of an appeal
taken after the term, and if it is not issued and served before
the end of the term to which it must be made returnable, the
appeal becomes inoperative. The rule is thus stated in 0atro
v. United State8, which was a case of an appeal taken after the
term, and in which a citation was necessary: "The writ of
error, or the allowance of appeal, together with a copy of the
record and the citation, when a citation is required, must be
returned to the next term of this court after the writ is sued
out or the appeal allowed; otherwise the writ of error, or the
appeal, as the case may be, will become void, and the party
desiring to invoke the appellate jurisdiction will be obliged to
resort to a new writ of error or a new appeal." There is nothing in any of the cases to the contrary of this. As, withoult a
citation or its waiver, we cannot take jurisdiction of this appeal,
and it is conceded that none has been issued or served, and
there is no sufficient evidence of a waiver,
