BARRY v. EDMUNDS.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR TtE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.
Argued January 7, 8, 1886.-Decided February 1, 1886.

A suit cannot properly be dismissed by a Circuit Court of the United States as
not substantially involving a controversy within the jurisdiction of the
court, unless the facts when mnadc to appear on the record; create a legal

certainty of that conclusion.
Where exemplary damages beyond the sum necessary to give a Circuit Court
of the United States jurisdiction are claimed in an action for a malicious
trespass, the court should not dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction
simply because the record shows that the actual injury caused to the plaintiff by the trespass was less than the jurisdictional amount.
It is settled in this court that in an action for a trespass accompanied with
malice, .the plaintiff may recover exemplary damages in excess of the
amount of his injuries, if the ad damnum is properly laid.

BARRY v. EDMUNDS.
Statement of Facts.

This was an action of trespass brought by the plaintiff in
error. The declaration set out the cause of action as follovs:
"Robert P. Barry,. plaintiff, complains of E. G. Edmunds,
defendant, of a plea of trespass on the case, for this, to wit:
that the plaintiff is a citizen and resident of Fauquier County,
Virginia; that he owns property in said county, and that he
was duly and lawfully assessed with the sum of fifty-six dollars
and thirty-four cents as taxes upon said property, to be paid to
the State of Virginia for the year 1884; that said taxes, by the
laws of said State, were nob leviable for prior to the first day
of December, 1884, but if not paid prior to said last-named date
were leviable for, after said date.
"That, by a further provision of the laws of said State, if
the taxes assessed for the year 1884 are not paid on or before
the first day of December, 1884, the person owing the same
becomes liable to pay, in addition thereto, a further sum of five
per centum upon the amount of the tax so due.
"That the plaintiff did not pay his said tax prior to the first
day of December, 1884, and thereby became liable to pay an
additional sum of two dollars and eighty-one cents, making the
plaintiff thus liable after the 1st day of December, 1884, for
the sum of ($59.15) fifty-nine dollars and fifteen cents.
"That the defendant is the treasurer of Fauquier County, in
the State of Virginia, and as such it is made his duty, by the
laws of Virginia, to collect all taxes due to the said State by
residents of said county; that in the month of June, 1885, the
plaintiff tendered to the defendant, in payment of his said taxes,'
fifty-nine - dollars, in coupons and lawful money of the
United States, the two together constituting the full amount
due for said taxes; that each one of the said coupons was cut.
from a bond issued by the State of Virginia, under the authority
of the provisions of an act of her General Assembly, approved'
March 28, 1879, entitled 'An act -to provide a plan of settlement of the public debt; ' that each one bore upon its fade' the
contract of the State of Virginia that it should be received in
payment of all taxes, debts, and demands due to said State.
and that each one was due and past maturity.
'4That the defendant refused the said coupons and money in

Ipayment .of the plaintiff's taxes; that he refused
to receive the

same in payment of his taxes because an act of the General
Assembly of the State of Virginia, approved January 26, 1882,
entitled ' An act to.,provide for the more efficient collection of
the revenue, to support government, maintain the public schools,
-.
and to pay interest upon the public debt,' forbade him to receive them, and because another act of the General Assembly
of said State, approved January 14, 1882, entitled ' An act to
prevent frauds upon the Commonwealth and the holders of her
.securities in the collection and disbursement of revenue,' likewise forbade him to' receive them.
" That on the -

day of June, 1885, the defendant, unlaw-

fully, maliciously, and against the will of the plaintiff, entered
upon the premises of the plaintiff, situated and being in the
county of Fauquier, Virginia, with force and arms, and against
the will of the plaintiff, and, acting as said treasurer aforesaid,
did levy on and forcibly seize and carry away valuable personal
property belonging to the said plaintiff, to wit, one valuable
horse, of the value of one hundred and twenty-five dollars, for
the purpose of selling the same, and thus compelling the plaintiff to pay his taxes in another medium than that already
offered by the plaintiff.
"That on the day when the defendant so levied on the plaintiff's property, and before he did so, the plaintiff again tendered
to the defendant the said coupons and money in payment of
his said taxes, but the defendant refused to receive the same
in payment thereof; and the plaintiff was always ready and
willing up to the moment of said levy to deliver to the defendant the said coupons and money in payment of his said taxes,
but the defendant always refused so to receive the same.
"That the defendant levied on the plaintiff's said property
and carried the same away, because the 18th section of the act
of the General Assembly of Virginia, approved April 1, 1879,
which is chapter 60 of the acts of the special session of 1879,
commanded. him so to levy upon the plaintiff's property, notwithstanding said tender.
. "That, byi'easor of the contract of the State of Virginia set
forth upon the face of said coupons, the plaintiff had a right to

Statement of Facts.

pay his said taxes with said coupons and money, and after he
tendered the same to said treasurer his said taxes were, in point
of law, paid and extinguished, and he held the said coupons and
money for the defendant as his agent in that behalf thereafter,
"That, when the defendant so levied upon and seized the
plaintiff's property, he knew that the Supreme Court of the
United States had decided at its October Term, 1884, in the
case of Poindexterv. 6(reenhow, that a tender by a tax-payer of
the State's tax-receivable coupons, such as those tendered by
the plaintiff in payment of taxes due the State, pays and extinguishes said tax, and that any and all laws of said State commanding her treasurers to refuse the same, and commanding
them to levy after said tender, are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and are, therefore, null and void.
"That the defendant, so knowing the law, levied on and,
seized the plaintift's property in contempt of and defiance of
the law, and with the deliberate intention of defying the Constitution of the United States and the judicial powers thereof.
"That there exists in the State of Virginia a very great political party, which comprises a majority of the voters in said
State, which has for its aims and purpose to enact laws that
will defeat and destroy the effect of the judgment of the Su-preme Court of the United States in said case of Poindexter v.
Green7w, and will defeat and destroy the protection afforded
by the Constitution of the United States to tax-payers who seek
to pay their taxes with said tax-receivable coupons.
"That said party, being in control of the Legislature of the
said State, has enacted a great number of statutes which are
intended to have that effect, and it openly proclaims that it
intends to enact all other and further statutes which shall be
necessary to make it impossible for tax-payers to pay their
taxes with said coupons.
"That the defendant is a member of said political party, and
sympathizes with and shares in its aims. and purposes, and actively co-operates in every way in his power in every attempt to
make it impossible for tax-payers to pay taxes due to said State
with said coupons.
"That, when he refused to receive said coupons in payment

of plaintiff's taxes, and when he levied on plaintiff's property
as aforesaid, he did it for the purpose of aiding and assisting
his said political party in its attempts to defy and nullify the
Constitution of the United States.
"That he intended thereby to intimidate the plaintiff and
make him afraid to rely upon the Constitution of the United
States and th3 judicial power thereof for protection in those
rights guaranteed to the plaintiff by said Constitution.
"That he intended to make an example of the plaintiff, and
thereby deter him and all others from relying upon the Constitution of the United States and the judicial power thereof
for the protection in those rights guaranteed by the said Constitution; that in contempt of and defiance of the said Constitution
and said judicial power the defendant made public advertisement in many parts of the county of Fauquier that he had levied
.onand seized plaintiff's property, because plaintiff was delin-quent as a tax-payer, and that he would sell the same at public
auction, on a day named, at the court-house of said county; that
on the day named he did expose the said property to sale at
public auction, at said cdurt-house, in the presence of many of
plaintiff's neighbors, friends, and fellow-countrymen, and publicly proclaimed that plaintiff was a defaulter and delinquent
tax-payer; that by reason thereof plaintiff's credit and standing were greatly injured and his feelings cruelly wounded and
mortified.
"That the defendant well knew when he made said levy
and sale that they were forbidden by the Constitution of the
United States, but he did so trusting and believing that his
saidpolitical party would enact statutes of its State of Virginia
that would shield and protect him from all harm; that he
made said levy and sale maliciously and with the purpose and
intent to trample on the plaintiff's rights under the law and do
,him all the injury in his power.
"And the said plaintiff further says that he is a citizen of
Fauquier County, Virginia; that he owns property in said
county, and that he was duly and lawfully assessed upon said
property with the sum of fifty-six dollars thirty-four cents, as
taxes to be paidl to the State of Virginia for the year 1881,

for the sum of $59.15; that the defendant is the treasurer of
Fauquier County, in the State of Virginia, and as such it is,

day of Tune, in the- year eighteen hundred and eightyfive, the defendant, unlawfully and against the will of the
plaintiff, entered upon the premises of the plaintiff, situate and

"That in contempt of and defiance, of the said Constitution

upon the plaintiffs premises, as aforesaid, he did many other
wrongs and injuries to the plaintiff of a malicious nature, by
all which wrongs and injuries the plaintiff has been injured and
damaged six thousand dollars. And therefore he brings his
suit."
To this declaration the defendant filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, alleging that, .as the plaintiff and
defendant were both citizens of the State of Virginia j the courts
of that State had exclusive jurisdiction of the alleged cause of
action.
The record showed the following action and judgment of the
court':
"This cause came on this day to be considered by the court
upon a motion made by the plaintiff to set a day for argument of
a demurrer to the special plea filed herein. Upon consideration

substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within

Opinion of the Court.

the jurisdiction of this court, for the reason that the amount of
taxes due by the plaintiff to the State of Virginia was less than
one hundred dollars, and the property levied on and seized by
the, defendant was worth less than two hundred dollars, and,
therefore, that the matter in dispute in this cause does not exceed, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of five hundred dollars ($500).
"And it appearing to the court that this being an action for
damages,' if the jury should render a verdict' for ($500) five
hundred dollars damages such verdict would be excessive, and
the court would feel compelled to set it aside; the court is
further of opinion that this court is, for that reason, also without jurisdiction of this suit.
"The court is, therefore, for each of the aforesaid reasons, of
opinion that it is required to dismiss this suit by the act of Congress approved March 3, 1875, 'to determine the jurisdiction of
the Circuit Courts of the United States, and to regulate the
Iremoval of causes from the State courts, and for other
purposes;' and this suit is accordingly hereby dismissed and
stricken from the docket of the court, with costs."

Opinion of the Court.

470; Smith v. Greenlow, 109 U. S. 669; White v. Cheenhow,114 U. S. 307.
The ground on which the suit was dismissed was, that within
the meaning of § 5 of the act of March 3, 1875, it did not
"really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy
properly within the jurisdiction" of the Circuit Court;, and
that conclusion was founded on the facts stated in the declaration, that the amount of taxes due by the plaintiff to the State
of Virginia was less than one hundred dollars, and the property
levied on and seized by the defendant was worth less than two
hundred dollars; and on the proposition of law, that it followed
from these facts that the matter in dispute did not exceed, exelusive of costs, the sum or value of five hundred dollars, so
that a verdict for any amount beyond that would be excessive, and for that reason to be set aside.
The order of the Circuit Court dismissing the 3ause on this,
ground is reviewable by this court on writ of error by the express words of the act. In making such an order, therefoie, the,
Circuit Court exercises a legal and not a personal discretion,,
which must be exerted in view of the facts sufficiently proven,
and controlled by fixed rules of law. It might happen that
the judge, on the trial or hearing of a cause, would receive impressions amounting to a moral certainty that it does not really
and substantially involve a dispute or controversy within the
jurisdiction of the court. But upon such a personal conviction,
however strong, he would not be at liberty to act, unless the
facts on wlhich the persuasion is based, when made distinctly to,
appear on the record, create a legal certainty of the conclusion
based on them. Nothing less than this is meant. by the statute
when it provides that the failure of its jurisdiction, on this account, "shall appear to the satisfaction of said Circuit Court." ,
This is quite consistent with what was said in Smith v. Gv'en,how, 109 U. S. 669, 671. There the value of the property taken
was stated in the declaration to be $100, while the damages for
the alleged trespass were laid at $6000, and no circumstaices'of
malice or of special damage were averred. It was said by the
court : "We cannot, of course, assume as a matter of law that
the amount laid, or a less amount, greater than $50G, is not

OCTOBER TERM, 1885.
Opinion of the Court.

recoverable upon the case stated in the declaration, and cannot,
therefore, justify the order remanding the cause on the ground
that the matter in dispute does not exceed the sum or value of
$500. But if the Circuit Court had found, as matter of fact,*
that the amount of damages stated in the declaration was colorable, and had been laid beyond the amount of a reasonable
expectation of recovery, for the purpose of creating a case
removable under the act of Congress, so that, in the words of
the 5th section of the act of 1875 it appeared that the suit ' did
not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy
properly within the jurisdiction of said Circuit Court,' the order*
remanding it to the State court could have been sustained."
It is true, indeed, that in some cases it might appear as matter of law, from the nature of the case as stated in the pleadings,
that there could not legally be a judgment recovered for the
amount necessary to the jurisdiction, notwithstanding the damages were laid in the declaration at a.larger sum. In the early
case of Wilson v. Daniel, 3 Dall. 401, 407, decided in this court
in 1'798, under the judiciary act of 1M89, then in force, it was
declared, by Chief-Justice Ellsworth, that, "The nature of the
case must certailily guide the judgment of the court; and whenever the law makes a rule, that rule must be pursued. Thus,
in an action of debt on a bond for £100, the principal and interest are put in demand and the plaintiff can recover no more,
though 'he may lay his damages at £10,000. The form of the
action, therefore, gives in that case the legal rule. But in an
action of trespass, or assault and battery, where the. law prescribes no limitation as to the amount to be recovered and the
plaintiff has a right to estimate his damages at any sum, the
damage stated in the declaration is the thing put in demand,
and presents the only criterion to which, from the nature of the
action, we can resort in settling the question of jurisdiction.
The proposition, then, is simply this: Where the law gives no
rule, the demand of the plaintiff must furnish one; but where
the law gives the rule, the legal cause of action, and not *the
plaintiff's demand, must be regarded."
The amount of damages 'laid in the declaration, however, in
cases where the law gives no rule, is not. conclusive upon the

BARRY v. EDMY1QDS.
Opinion of the Coirk

question of jurisdiction ; but if upon the case stated there'could
legally be a recovery for the amount necessary to the jurisdiction, and that amount is claimed, it would be necessary, in
order to defeat the jurisdiction since the passage of the act of
March 3, 1875, for the court to find, as matter of fact, upon
evidence legally sufficient, "that the amount of damages stated
in the declaration was colorable, and had been laid beyond the
amount of a reasonable expectation of recovery, for the purpose
of creating a case" within the jurisdiction of the court. Then
it would appear to the satisfaction of the court that the suit
"did not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said Circuit Court."
In the present case the Circuit Court has not found, a matter of fact, that the amount of damages stated in the declaration
was colorable and had been laid beyond the amount of a reasonable expectation of recovery, for the purpose of creating a case
within the jurisdiction of the court. Its action is not based oh
evidence of an attempted fraud upon the jurisdiction of thecourt, but upon the assumption, as matter of law, that upon
the face of the declaration no recovery could be legally had of
an amount sufficient to make the matter in dispute equal to
that required to maintain its jurisdiction.
Such cases, as we have already seen, may exist, where a rule
of law, as in certain cases ex contractu, in which the amount
recoverable is liquidated by the terms of the agreement, fixes
the limit of a possible recovery. Such was the case of Lee v.
WVatooa, 1 Wall. 337, where it appeared "that in the progress
of the cause an amendment was made in the amount of
damages claimed for the purpose of bringing the case within
the appellate jurisdiction of, this court." As was said in
Hilton v. Dickinson, 108 U. S. 165, 174, "it is undoubtedly
true, that until it is in some way shown by the record that the
sum demanded is not the matter in dispute, that sum will
govern in all questions of jurisdiction, but it is equally true
that, when it is shown that the sum demanded is not the real
matter in dispute, the sum shown and not the sum demanded
will prevail." In Bownan. v. ChZicago and Ycarthwestern Railway Co., 113 U. S. 611, an amendment was made increasing
VOL. cxvI-36

OCTOBER TERM, 1885.
Opinion of the Court.

the amount demanded as damages, under circumstances that
rendered it apparent, as a matter of fact, that it was done
merely to give color to the jurisdiction of this court.
No such fact or finding appears on the record in the present
case, and the question recurs whether, as matter of strict law,
it can be judicially declared that, upon the cause of action
stated in the declaration, the plaintiff is precluded from recovering anythingin excess of $500 as damages exclusive of costs.
The cause of action stated in the declaration is a wilful and
malicious trespass, in seizing and taking personal property, with
circumstances of aggravation and averments of special damage.
The trespass is alleged to have been committed by tho defendant, colo re yoii, under the pretended authority of void process, in open defiance of known law, accompanied by conduct
intended to bring the plaintiff into public contempt and odium,
and amounting to oppression in office.
It is quite clear that the amount of the taxes alleged to be
delinquent, for non-payment of which the seizure was made, is
immaterial. It is equally clear that the plaintiff is not limited
in his recovery to the mere value of the property taken. That
would not necessarily cover his actual, direct, and immediate
pecuniary loss, In addition, according to the settled law of
this court, he might show himself, by proof of the circumstances, to be entitled to exemplary damages calculated to
vindicate his right and protect it against future similar invasions.
"It is a well established principle of the common law," said
Mr. Justice Grier in Day v. Toodwor't, 13 How. '362, 371,
4'that, in actions of trespass and all actions on the case for torts,
a jury may inflict what are called exemplary, punitive, or
vindictive damages upon a defendant, having in view the
enormity of his offence rather than the measure of compensation to the plaintiff. We are aware that the propriety of this
doctrine has been questioned by some writers; but, if repeated
judicial decisions for more than a century are to be received as
the best exposition of what the law is, the question will not'
admit of argument.

Opinion of the Court.

the plaintiff, which he would have been entitled to recover had
the injury been inflicted without design or intention, something
further by way of punishment or example, which has sometimes
been called ' smart money.' This has been always left to the
discretion of the jury, as the degree of the punishment to be
thus inflicted must depend on the peculiar circumstances of each
case." In Tiw Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat. 546, which was, the
case of a marine tort, Mr. Justice Story spoke of exemplary
damages as "the proper punishment which belongs to such
lawless misconduct." In Tracy v. Swartwout, 10 Pef. 80, 95,
it was said that "where a ministerial officer acts in good faith
for an injury done, he is not liable to exemplary damages ;"
and this implies its converse, when his acts are not only illegal,
but wanton, wilful, malicious, and oppressive. In PhkiAddpkia, Wilmingtoz & Baltimore Railroad Co. v. Quigley, 21
How. 202, 214, Mr. Justice Campbell said: "Whenever the
injury complained of has been inflicted maliciously or wantonly, and with circumstances of contumely or indignity, the
jury are not limited to the ascertainment of a simple compensation for the wrong committed against the aggrieved person.
But the malice spoken of in this rule is not merely the doing
of an unlawful or injurious act. The word implies that the act
complained of was conceived in the spirit of mischief or of
criminal indifference to civil obligations." In 3ilwaukee & ASt.
I'aul Railway Co. v. Arn.s, 91 U. S. 489, 493, the rule was
said to apply to actions on the case, for injuries arising from
the negligence of the defendant. "Redress commensurate to
such injuries," said Mr. Justice Davis, delivering the opinion of
the court, "should be bfforded. In ascertaining its extent, the
jury may consider all the -facts which relate to the wrongful
act of the defendant and its consequences to the plaintiff; but
they are not at liberty to go farther, unless it was done wilfully,
or was the result of that reckless indifference to the rights of
others which is equivalent to an intentional violation of them.
In that case the jury are authorized, for the sake of public
example, to give such additional damages as the circumstances
require. The tort is aggravated by the evil motive, and on this
rests the rule of exemplary damages." In .Afissouri Pacife

of the Court.

Railway Co. v. Rure, 115 U. S. 512, 521, Mr. Justice Field
said: "It is the duty of every State to provide, in the administration of justice, for the redress of private wrongs; yet the
damages which should be awarded to the injured party are not
always readily ascertainable. They -are in many cases a matter'of conjectural estimate, in relation to which there may be
great differences of opinion. The general rule undoubtedly is
that they should be precisely commensurate with the injury.
Yet in England and in this country they have been allowed in
excess of compensation whenever malice, gross neglect, or oppression has caused or accompanied the commission of the injury complained of." In the English Court of Common Pleas,
it was held, in the case of Bell v. 3idland Railway Co., 10
0. B. N-. S. 287, that, wherea railway company had obstructed
a siding belonging to an adjoining landowner with a high hand
and in violation of his rights under an act of Parliament, exemplary damages might justly be given. And the rule was
applied in Embleni v. Myers, 6 H. & N. 54, against one who
negligently and recklessly pulled down buildings on his own
land so as to injure his neighbor with a view to make him give
up possession. In that case Baron Bramwell said: "If a plaintiff, in his particulars, claimed £500 because the defendant
walked over his lawn the jury might award that amount if
they thought it was done for the purpose of annoyance and
insult." In Johnson v. Hannahan,3 Strobhart, 425, the Court
of Appeals of South Carolina, in an action of trespass quare
clausumfregit,where the plaintiff sought to recover damages
for an invasion of his close, accompanied, as he alleged, by circumstances of oppression and insult, refused to set aside a
verdict for $3000, as excessive, although the actual and mere
pecuniary loss, it was shown, did not amount to $20. In .Yolb
v. Bandiead, 18 Texas, 228, which was an action of trespass
for cutting down and carrying off timber from the land of
another, where the defendant had wilfully or by gross negli,gence cut over his own line on the land of the plaintiff, it was
said by the Supreme Court of Texas, that, "in estimating the
damages the jury were not confined strictly to mere compensation for the timber cut and removed. It was their right to

Opinion of the Court.

look to the particular circumstances of the case, and give such
damages as the facts were deemed by them to warrant, and as
would, in their judgment, be adequate, not only for compensation, but also for prevention."
It is unnecessary, however, further to multiply authorities
on this point. The precedents are indefinite in number, and
the application of the rule as uniform as the circumstances of
the cases are various. There was clear error in the Circuit
Court in its ruling, as matter of law, that there could be no
lawful recovery, in such a case as that stated in the declaration,
of an amount equal to that which is necessary to support the
jurisdiction of the court. The same error was repeated in acting upon the statement, that a verdict, if rendered for that
amount, would be excessive and set aside for that reason-a
statement which could not, at any rate, be judicially made before such a verdict was in fact rendered. It adds, indeed, to
the principal error, if any distinction can be made, that which
consists in encroaching upon the province of the jury. For
nothing is better settled than that, in such-cases as the present,
and other actions for torts where no precise rule of law fixes
the recoverable damages, it is the peculiar function of the jury
to determine the amount by their verdict. In Whipple v. The
Cumberland.fanufaeturing Co., 2 Story, 661, 670, Mr. Justice
Story well expressed the rule on this subject, that a verdict
will not be set aside in a case 6f tort for excessive damages
"unless the court can clearly see that the jury have committed
some very gross and palpable error, or have acted under some
improper bias, influence or prejudice, or have totally mistaken
the rules of law by which the damages are to be regulated "that is, "unless the verdict is so excessive or outrageous," with
reference to all the circumstances of the case, "as to demonstrate that the jury have acted against the rules of law, or have
suffered their passions, their prejudices, or their perverse disregard of justice to mislead them." In no case is it permissible
for the court to substitute itself for the jury, and compel a compliance on the part of the latter with its own view of the facts
in evidence, as the standard and measure of that justice, which
the jury itself is the appointed constitutional tribunal to award.

OCTOBER TERM, 1885.
Opinion of the, Court.

The base' of Beardwre v. Carringlon, 2 Wilson, 24, was an
hction of trespass and false imprisonment against the defendants, who were four of the King's messengers in ordinary.
They justified the alleged,trespass under a warrant of the Earl
of Halifax, then one of the principal Secretaries of State, requiring them to arrest the plaintiff as the author of some seditious
libels, and to seize his books and papers. There was a verdict
for the plaintiff for £1000 damages, and a motion for a new
trial on the sole ground that the damages were excessive. The
court (Pratt, afterwards Lord Camden, being Lord Chief Justice) said: "Can we say that-£1000 are monstrous damages as
against him who has granted an illegal warrant to a niessengr, who entersinto a man's house and prys into all his secret
and private affairs, and carries him from his house and business and imprisons him for six days; it is an unlawful power
assumed by a great Minister of State.; can anybody say that a
guinea yer diem is sufficient damages in this extraordinary
case, which concerns the liberty of every one of the King's

,subjects; we cannot say the damages of £1000 are enormous,"
The dignity and value of the right assailed, and the power and
authority of the source from which the assault proceeds, are
elements to be considered in the computation of damages, if
they are to be, not only compensation for the direct loss inflicted, but a remedy and prevention for the greater wrong and
injury involved in the apprehension of its repetition. Huck&
v. Aone, 2 Wilson, 20.5.
The section of the act of March 3, 1875, under which the
Circuit Court acted in dismissing the present action confers a
beneficial authority to be wisely exercised in defeating collusive and fraudulent experiments upon its jurisdiction; but the
discretion it confers is judicial, proceeding upon ascertained
facts according to rules of law, and subject to revieN# for apparent errors. Foxr the reasons already given we are not able
to uphold its exercise in the present instance, and
The judgment dimisszing the action is accordingly reversed,
and the cause is remanded, with directions to take suwh
furtherproeedingetherein as the law requires and in conformity with this opinion.
