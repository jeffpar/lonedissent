MANHATTAN BANK OF MEMPHIS v. WALKER.
WALKER v. MANHATTAN BANK OF MEMPHIS.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE.
Nos. 205, 682. Argued March 14,15,1889. -Decided

April 8,1889.

A state bank gave a receipt or certificate, stating that J., agent for W., had
placed with it, on special deposit, $5200 of railroad mortgage bonds,
and a note for $5000. The receipt was sent by the bank by mail directly
to W., on the request of J. At the same time the bank entered the note
and the bonds in its special deposit book as deposited by J., agent for W.
Afterwards, with the concurrence of J., but without authority from W.,
the bank discounted the note and applied its avails to pay a debt due to
it from a firm whose business J. managed, and delivered up the bonds to
J., knowing that he intended to pledge them as security to another bank
for i loan of money to the same firm. The bank also knew that J. held
the note and bonds as investments for W., and that it was not a safe investment to lend their avails to the firm: Held, that the bank was liable
to W. for the amount of the note and the value of the bonds.
A suit in equity by W. against the bank for the return of the property or
the payment of its value, would lie, as it was a suit to charge the bank,
as a trustee, for a breach of trust in regard to a special deposit.

MR. JusTicE BL.ATCHO-RD delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit originally brought in the Chancery Court of
Shelby County, Tennessee, by Eliza Walker against the M anhattan Bank of Memphis, a Tennessee banking corporation.
The suit was removed by the plaintiff into the Circuit Court
of the United States for the Western District of Tennessee.
The bill of complaint and the answer were both of them put
in before, and the replication was filed after, the removal of
the cause.
The bill prays for a decree for the return to the plaintiff of
$3000 of the second-mortgage bonds of the Memphis and
Charleston Railroad Company, and $2200 of the second-mortgage bonds of the Mississippi Central Railroad Company, and
of a promissory note for $5000, made by Edward Goldsmith,
and of certain shares of the capital stock of the defendant,
amounting to $6000, attached to the said promissory note as
security therefor. The bill alleges that the defendant, in the
course of its business, and on the 27th of November, 1880,
received on special deposit the above-named bonds, promissory
note and shares of stock, belonging to the plaintiff, together
with a certificate of the stock of the People's Insurance Company, for $1100, and four promissory notes for $325 in the
aggregate; that the said bonds had coupons attached thereto

MANHATTAN BANK v. WALKER.
Opinion of the Court.

for the interest payable thereon at certain stated periods; that
the defendant gave its obligation in writing, as evidence of the
receipt on special deposit, from the plaintiff, of the said securities, and was bound to deliver them to the plaintiff on demand;
and that the stock of the People's Insurance Company, and
the $325 of notes, were returned to her, but the bonds and the
coupons attached thereto, and the note of Goldsmith, and the
bank stock were never returned to her, although she made
demand upon the defendant for them. The bill prays for a
decree for the return of the property, and for the amount of
the decline in its value from the time when she demanded it
until the time when it shall be restored; and, if not restored,
then for a personal decree against the defendant for the highest
value of it at any time since she first made demand for it to
the date of the decree, with interest.
The answer sets up in defence, that, for some time prior to
November, 1880, Mr. G. H. Judah, a brother-in-law of the
plaintiff, kept an account and had transactions with the defendant, in which he styled himself sometimes agent, and sometimes guardian, but without disclosing for whom he was agent
or guardian; that he made deposits and drew checks in that
way on his account, as the other depositors with the defendant
did, and, at different times, prior to November, 1880, bought
the bonds and insurance company's stock named in the bill,
a:nd paid for them by checks on his account with the defendant; that, as he would buy those securities, he would leave
them on deposit with the defendant, without taking any receipt
for them; that, in the fall of 1880, he left with the defendant
the Goldsmith note and the collateral therefor, and the four
other notes mentioned in the bill; that those notes were payable to the said G. H. Judah as agent simply, without saying
for whom he was agent; that, prior to November 27, 1880, he
had never told the defendant whether he had any principal or
not, or who his principal was, or for whom be was guardian,
if for any one; that on or about that date, he asked the defendant to give to him, as agent for the plaintiff, a receipt for
the bonds, stocks and notes, telling it at the time that he was
the plaintiff's general agent for the management and control of

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

those securities and notes; that the defendant gave to him a
receipt as such agent; that, after the receipt was given, some
of the notes described in it were paid while they were on deposit with the defendant, and the said Judah, as agent of the
plaintiff, drew out the money in the ordinary way, and from
time to time, as agent of the plaintiff, withdrew from the custody of the defendant the items mentioned in the receipt, until
he had withdrawn them all, when he gave to the defendant a
receipt for them, in which he acknowledged having received
them as agent for the plaintiff ; that, if the plaintiff owned the
items, Judah had authority from her to control and manage
them, as fully as she could have done as owner, if they had
been in her actual possession, instead of in his possession as
her agent; that he was her general agent with reference to
them, and had power not only to deposit them, but also to
withdraw them from deposit, if he saw fit; that, when he demanded them from the defendant, his agency was still in force,
and the defendant could not legally have refused to give them
up to him as the agent of the plaintiff; that, upon returning
them to Judah, as such agent, all liability of the defendant
with reference to them ceased; and that the defendant is not
indebted to the plaintiff on account of said securities.
Proofs wer6 taken on both sides, and the cause was heard;
and the court made a decree adjudging to the plaintiff a recovery against the defendant of $5000, being the amount of
the Goldsmith note, with $1115 interest thereon from the date
of its maturity, November 1, 1881, on the ground that the
defendant had collected the amount of that note and appropriated the same to its owxt use, and further decreeing that
the defendant was not liable to the plaintiff for any of the
other items mentioned in the bill, and that neither party
should recover costs from the other. Each party has taken a
separate appeal to this court.
The answer does not set up, as a defence, that the defendant was not authorized to receive the property in question as
a special deposit, or to give the receipt therefor. It was stipulated between the parties that the defendant received no compensation, as bailee, for the custody of the property sued for;

MANHATTAN BANK v. WALKER.
Opinion of the Court.

that the Memphis and Charleston Railroad bonds bore seven
per cent interest, payable semi-annually, and evidenced by interest coupons maturing January 1 and July 1 in each year, the
bonds maturing on the 1st of January, 1885; and that the
Mississippi Central Railroad bonds bore eight per cent interest,
payable semi-annually, and evidenced by coupons maturing
February 1 and August 1 in each year, the bonds maturing
on the 1st of February, 1885.
The suit is plainly one of equitable cognizance, the bill being
filed to charge the defendant, as a trustee, for a breach of trust
in regard to a special deposit.
The opinion of the Circuit Court, reported in 25 Fed. Rep.
247, contains so full and accurate a statement, in the main,
of the facts of the case, developed by the proofs, that we
repeat and adopt it, as follows: "The firm of Walker Bros.
& Co., composed of the plaintiff's husband, his brother and
G. H. Judah, was a large mercantile house in Memphis that
disastrously failed and made an assignment. The plaintiff
and the wife of the other brother, being creditors of the firm
for large amounts due them for loans to the firm, owned the
book accounts, which were bought for their use by Judah in
the name of Maas,the book-keeper, at the assignee's sale, the
husband of plaintiff paying for her share. These books, with
the knowledge and consent of plaintiff and her husband, who
afterwards died -but
it seems without any specific instructions of any kind - were left with Judah to collect the debts
and manage the fund for the two beneficiaries, who resided
in other cities. His control over the funds was of the most
plenary character. He married a sister of the two brothers,
and had been the most active member of the ftrm and was
best acquainted with its business. The collections were deposited with the defendant bank in his name as 'guardian,' or
in the name of Maas, the former book-keeper of the firm,
who became the book-keeper and assistant cashier of the
defendant bank. Prior to November 27, 1880, Judah had.
purchased certain securities with the funds, which he kept
on special deposit with the bank or in the name of Maas. On
that day he came to the bank and asked Maas for a receipt,

showing the special deposit, to send to the plaintiff. The
bank was not in the habit of giving receipts or certificates
for these special deposits, but kept them noted by numbers
in a book used for that purpose. Maas wrote a receipt on
a sheet of the bank's letter-paper, and according to his and
Judah's testimony, placed it in one of the bank's envelopes
addressed to the plaintiff, and put it with the bank's mail.
The plaintiff and her daughter swear that it was accompanied
by a letter from Maas. What was in the letter does not
appear, and, not being preserved, it has not been produced,
but is supposed to have been burned as useless. The routine
of the bank was that Goldsmith, the cashier, personally signed
aind inspected every letter and himself enveloped and addressed
them. This letter he did not see or sign, and it was never
copied into the letter-press. The receipt was a§ follows:

partner, but afterwards stated she was informed he was not.
He says he was only a salaried manager. The members of
the firm were inexperienced, and Judah was, in fact, the
ahnost sole manager of all its. affairs-the master spirit of
the concern. It is not shown that the young men took any
part, except "One of them kept the books after laas had
opened them.
"The plaintiff in October, 1880, lent to her son, the firm,
being also responsible, $10,000, as his capital in the concern,
derived from the life insurance of her husband. Judah also
appropriated or lent to the firm, from time to time, sums
amounting to over $9000, from his collections in behalf of
plaintiff on the old books. The interest on these sums and on
the special deposit funds were remitted by the firm-not
always promptly - to the plaintiff at Philadelphia, by exchange or checks; and sometimes the coupons were sent by
express to her. When remittances'were delayed she wrote or
telegraphed the firm. She never communicated with the bank
in any way. The remittances were nearly always in letters by
her son, and they contained apologies and explanations for
delays.
"The defendant bank made large advances to the firm, generally by discounts on the security of the firm's ' country paper' due from its customers. Judah promised the bank to
always protect it as far as in his power, and the relation was
very confidential. The bank began to urge him for a reduction of the account, and, not being willing to accommodate

.

The bank did not make the loan, because Judah was

unwilling to pay the money on the old account. He could get
the money at the Bank of Commerce. He told the officers of
the defendant bank so, and they delivered the securities to
him, fully knowing that he was going'to make that use of
them. Maas consulted the president and the attorney whether
he should deliver the securities to Judah, and they directed
him to do so. He had forgotten, however, giving him the receipt and sending it to plaintiff, and neither the president nor
the attorney knew that fact. Goldsmith, the regular cashier,
was absent in New York, but he never knew that fact. Maas
never mentioned it, because, he says, he deemed it unimportaut at the time and forgot it afterwards. The securities were
pledged to the Bank of Commerce, except the People's Insurance stock, which was on the books in plaintiff's name and
could not be used by Judah. They were sold by that bank to
satisfy the loan, and are lost to plaintiff. The firm of Walker
Sons & Co. soon after failed disastrously, owing defendant
bank a balance of over $5000, notwithstanding Judah, according to his promise, appropriated to the debt certain stocks of
his own, and his diamonds. After the failure, Kramer, a sonin-law of plaintiff and a lawyer, came to Memphis and presented the receipt, and then the plaintiff learned, for the first
time, that the securities had been so used by Judah and the
bank. Kramer secured the delivery to himself of certain
'country paper' and mortgages to secure notes that were then
first taken for $20,000 lent by plaintiff to the firm, not including, however, the securities in controversy here. An angry
lawsuit grew out of this transaction, in this family, in the
courts of Arkansas. A New York gentleman, nephew of the
other young Walker, filed a bill stating that the securities belonged to him to secure his guaranty of a loan by the Importers and Traders' Bank of New York to the firm for some
$26,000, and that he had sent them to the firm for collection,
and that they were, by the plaintiff's son, and without consent
of the other Walker or Judah, turned over to his own mother;
all of which was denied, and the averment made that this

scheme was trumped up to defeat plaintiff of her advantage
and enable Judah to continue business on the assets at Indian
Bay, Arkansas."
The Circuit Court held that the defendant was liable for the
amount of the Goldsmith note and interest from the date of
its collection, because it had collected the money and never
paid it to the plaintiff, but had, without due authority, appropriated it to its own use, on account of the debt due to it from
Walker Sons & Co. As to the $5200 of bonds, the court held
that knowledge by the defendant of the intended breach of
trust by Judah did not make the defendant privy to it and
liable for it, as the defendant did not participate in the profits
of the fraud; that the receipt given by the defendant did not
change the relation of Judah to the property and to the defendant, as it was not a receipt to the plaintiff but one to
Judah; and that it did not satisfactorily appear that the
defendant received any part of the money advanced on the
bonds.
We are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover,
not only in respect to the Goldsmith note, but in respect to
the $5200 of bonds.
In regard to the Goldsmith note, shortly before it matured,
in November, 1881, Judah indorsed it over to the defendant
as collateral security for a note of larger amount, made by
Walker Sons & Co., which the defendant then discounted at
the instance of Judah. The proceeds of that discount were,
to the extent of $6000, applied by the defendant upon a debt
antecedently existing from Walker Sons & Co. to it. When
the Goldsmith note became due, in November, 1881, the defendant, claiming to be the owner of it, collected it and
retained the proceeds. Thus a note which confessedly, and
to the knowledge of the defendant, belonged to the plaintiff,
was diverted to the use of the defendant by the co-operation
of it and of Judah. Judah, if not a partner in the firm of
Walker Sons & Co., was, to the knowledge of the officers of
the defendant, the active and controlling manager, both in its
business with the defendant and otherwise, of the affairs of
that firm. Maas, the assistant cashier of the defendant, and

who was its acting cashier during the period of the transactions in question, was, before his connection with the defendant, the confidential book-keeper of the prior firm' of Walker
Bros. & Co., of which Judah was a member, and had a close
personal intimacy with Judah. When the book accounts of
Walker Bros. & Co. were sold, Maas bought them, on behalf
of the plaintiff and her sister, and the funds realized from that
purchase were in part deposited in the name of Maas, with the
defendant; and M\Iaas, on the request of Judah, opened the
books of Walker Sons & Co., when that firm was formed.
Judah promised Maas that he would certainly protect the
defendant in case of disaster to the firm of Walker Sons
& Co.
At the time the Goldsmith note was thus converted, the
condition of Walker Sons & Co. was precarious, if the firm
was not insolvent. Before the conversion of the railroad bonds,
Judah pledged to the defendant certain stocks belonging to
himself, for the debt due to it by Walker Sons & Co.; and
it is apparent that Judah was constantly being pressed by the
defendant to make payments on the firm's debt to it, and that
Maas, being the acting cashier of the defendant, knew, from
the state of the account which the firm kept with the defendant, that it was substantially without available funds. In
none of the transactions between the defendant and Judah
in regard to the Goldsmith note and the bonds, was the receipt
or certificate which had been sent to the plaintiff redelivered
to the defendant; and the defendant knew that it had gone
into the hands of the plaintiff, because it had been sent to her
by mail directly from the defendant.
In lVational Bank v. Graham, 100 U. S. 699, one Graham
had deposited in a national bank certain bonds of the United
States for safe-keeping, and had received from the cashier a
receipt setting forth that fact, and that the bonds were to be
redelivered on the return of the receipt. Before and after
that time, the officers of the bank were accustomed to receive
such deposits from others, and they were entered in a book
kept by the bank. The bonds were stolen from the custody
of the bank, through its gross negligence. On this state of

MAN-HATTAN BANK v. WALKER.
Opinion of the Court.

facts, this court said, (p. 702:) "If a bank be accustomed to
take such deposits as the one here in question, and this is
known and acquiesced in by the directors, and the property
deposited is lost by the gross carelessness of the bailee, a liability ensues in like manner as if the deposit had been authorized by the terms of the charter." In support of this proposition, the court cited the cases of Foster v. Essex Bank, 17
Mass. 4179; Lancaster Co. Bank v. Smith, 62 Penn. St. 47;
Scott v. Bank of Chester Valley, 72 Penn. St. 471; Bank of
Carlisle v. G akarn, 79 Penn. St. 106; Turner v. Bank of
Eeokuk, 26 Iowa, 562; Smith v. Bank of Iestfeld, 99 Mase.
605; ChattahoocheeBank v. Schley, 58 Georgia, 369.
We are of opinion that the execution of the receipt or certificate in question, and its transmission by mail directly by
the defendant to the plaintiff, created the relation of bailor
and bailee between her and the defendant, and made it an act
of gross negligence for the defendant to deliver, or dispose of,
or appropriate the securities in question, on the sole request of
Judah, and without her direct authority. Under the circumstances of the case, the receipt having been made out by Maas,
the assistant cashier, and sent by him to the plaintiff, on the
request of Judah made on her behalf, the statement in the receipt that Judah, agent for the plaintiff, had placed the securities with the defendant on special deposit, must be regarded
as virtually a statement that the plaintiff, by Judah as her
agent, had placed the securities with it on special deposit.
Maas's statement, in his testimony, is, that Judah came to
him, while he was in the discharge bof his duties in the bank,
"and said he wanted a receipt, or a statement rather, of what
securities he had there on special deposit, to send to Mrs.
Walker in Philadelphia.
.
. He said Mrs. Walker wanted
to know what she held.
.
. About that time, on our
special deposit book, these bonds and note and stock, mentioned in said receipt, were entered as deposited by G. H.
Judah, agt Mrs. Eliza Walker." Maas further states that
Judah never exhibited any authority to him or to the bank,
to dispose of the note and the bonds and securities mentioned
in the certificate which was sent to Mrs. Walker.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.

Judah testifies that the instructions of the plaintiff to him
did not, directly or indirectly, authorize him to pledge any
bonds or securities obtained with her money, for his own debts
or the debts of others, and that his power was limited to invest
her moneys for her exclusive benefit and use.
It is very clear that Judah had no power, either in fact or
in law, to pledge the Goldsmith note as security for an existing debt of Walker Sons & Co. to the defendant. Such act
was not an investment of the trust fund, and the officers of
the defendant knew that it was not. D-uncan v. Jaudon, 15
Wall. 165; Smith v. Ayer, 101 U. S. 320; lYational Bank v.
Inurance Co., 101 U. S. 54; Shaw v. Spencer, 100 Mass. 382;
Loring v. B-rodie, 134 Sfass. 453.
It is urged on the part of the defendant, that Judah, as
agent of the plaintiff, collected the book accounts of Walker
Bros. & Co.; that he deposited the moneys collected with the
defendant, t6 his credit as guardian; that out of those funds
he made loans to Walker Sons & Co., to which the plaintiff
did not object; and that he bought the securities in question
with moneys belonging to the same fund. But, from the fact
that the plaintiff had lent to the firm of Walker Sons & Co.
other moneys, it does not follow that, after the giving of the
receipt in question, authority from her to dispose of the securities so placed with the defendant on special deposit, is to be
inferred. Her demand upon the defendant, through Judah, for
the receipt showing the special deposit, and the sending of such
receipt directly to her by the defendant, changed the relations
of herself and Judah and the defendant, to the securities deposited. The defendant knew, as well as did Judah, that an
investment of the proceeds of any of the securities in a loan
to Walker Sons & Co., was not a safe investment. It also
knew that the appropriation of the proceeds of the Goldsmith
note towards paying a debt due to it by Walker Sons & Co.,
was an unlawful appropriation; and that the securities covered
by the receipt were held as investments, and were the property
of the plaintiff. So far as the collection of the interest on the
Goldsmith note and on the bonds was concerned, when the
moneys collected in fact reached the plaintiff, the transactions

MANHATTAN BANK v. WALKER.
Opinion of the Court.

were completed; aud no argument can be drawn from them
in support of any implied authority to Judah or to the defendant to divert or appropriate the principal of the securities.
The views above stated, as applicable to the Goldsmith
note, apply also, very largely, to the $5200 of bonds. Under
the terms of the receipt, the plaintiff was the bailor and
the defendant was the bailee, in respect of the bonds, equally
with the note. The defendant was not the bailee of Judah, so
as to be authorized to deliver the bonds to Judah without
the authority of the plaintiff. The defendant had no right to
deliver the bonds to Judah, when it knew that Judah intended to deliver them to the Bank of Commerce as collateral
security for a loan of money to be made by that bank to
Walker Sons & Co.; and this, without regard to the question
whether or not the defendant was to receive, or did receive,
any part of the money borrowed from the Bank of Commerce.
Judah applied to the defendant for a loan of money for
Walker Sons & Co. on the bonds. Maas, representing the
defendant, declined to make the loan. On receiving such
refusal, Judah stated to Maas that he could probably get the
money it the Bank of Commerce. Afterwards, he called
upon Maas for the bonds, and told him he had got the money
at the Bank of Connerce; and Maas knew, when he handed
the bonds to Judah, that Judah received them with a view to
a loan to be made by that bank to Walker Sons & Co., and
Maas also knew at that time that Judah was the agent of
Walker Sons & Co. By the face of the receipt, the defendant recognized the plaintiff as the true owner of the bonds,
her name being mentioned in it; and it was capable of no
other construction than that the plaintiff owned the securities
mentioned. Knowing, from what passed between Maas and
Judah, that the bonds were to be used to raise money for the
benefit of Walker Sons & Co., and knowing that such use was
an improper disposition of the bonds, unless the transaction
were affirmatively and directly sanctioned by the plaintiff, the
defendant became a party to the misappropriation of the
bonds. It is immaterial, in this view, whether or not the defendant received any portion of the money loaned by the Bank
of Commerce on the security of the bonds.

The decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the
